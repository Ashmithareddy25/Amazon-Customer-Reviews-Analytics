192076920X|1.0|Pseudo-philosophical and ultraviolent, laughable and extremely poorly written, I couldn't stop shaking my head while reading Shantaram. As an autobiography, the author is extremely conceited, and he paints a ridiculous portrait of Lin, the leading man: part Commando warrior, part junkie, part saint.... As for the writing, the imagery is histerically bad, you'll be groaning not-stop every time you read a description of Karla's beauty. I could go on and on: what about the contrived quotes that the author sprinkles the book with (\\"as Karla/Didier/... once said, bla bla bla ...\\"). What a pity I don't have the book with me right now to give some examples... And the philosophy is just pages and pages of tedious pretense that the author pounds our head with. <br /> <br />I am baffled by the positive reviews this novel has received. For me Shantaram was a waste of precious time. <br />  <br /> <br />
B00005MP58|4.0|A fan of the book, I thought this movie did an excellent job at staying true to the book. And while I not only enjoyed the movie I am also a huge Colin Firth fan which didn't hurt! = - ) However, I thought that there were several scenes throughout the movie that were unnecessary and did not add much to the development of the movie but rather served only to draw it out. I, personally, found that I liked the most recent version (2005)better although it does leave out some elements from the book which this edition covers.
B00004ZELJ|3.0|I first rented this DVD but due to the many songs and the high energy performance of the Backstreet Boys felt this was worth buying and adding to my collection of concert DVDs.
B0002DB50E|3.0|The movie has captivated me since I was a teenager. David Cronenberg draws a surreal, yet plausible picture of a future where   disease is spread through elctrons, not human touch.  <br /> <br />Great movie. I felt the only thing that was wrong with the Criterion edition was that deleted scenes were missing. Seeing the edited for TV version, scenes were added from the theatrical version, but missing from the Criterion Edition. The deleted scenes cleared up some of the movie's gaps, including how Spectacular Optical found videodrome by developing a sighting system for tanks. Criterion goes to the trouble of resurrecting obscure material never seen before, but skips over material that would make a fine director's cut? What a waste. Let Universal publish another $5.49 cheap rip for Target and Walmart.
0345350499|5.0|This book got me through a tough time in my life.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is feeling like an outsider. <br /> <br />I've re-read it many times and I still get very immersed in it.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|If you ever wondered where superheroes learn their trades, now you know - a high school in the clouds named Sky High, an institution run by Principal Powers (played by - who else - Lynda Carter).  This year's freshman class includes future defender of the world Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano).  He's the son of the world's greatest superheroes, Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston), he starts out with a natural archenemy in fellow student Warren Peace (Steven Strait), and everyone - from his classmates to Ron Wilson - Bus Driver (Kevin Hefferman) to Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell) expects great things of him.  There's just one problem: he has yet to develop any superpowers.  Dealing with the pressures of high school is bad enough without the added pressures of being a powerless sidekick in a family of the most super superheroes on Earth.<br /><br />Sky High is also a high school, which puts all sorts of pressure of its own on the young superhero.  There's a cultural divide between heroes and sidekicks, and some of those with the greatest powers use their special skills to bully others.  Will sort of straddles the fence initially, as his lack of powers put him in the sidekick curriculum.  When his power finally manifests itself, he moves over to the hero class - and that's where his troubles really begin.  He tries to maintain his relationship with his sidekick friends, including best friend Layla, but the increasing attention of senior class president Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) really go to his head.  Like many a young person, Will is sort of stupid.  Layla (Danielle Panabaker) is a total babe who just so happens to be crazy about him, but he lets this pretty senior totally turn his head without stopping to wonder why the senior class's most desirable female is putting the moves on a freshman.<br /><br />I don't need to tell you how the story develops, as it's all pretty predictable stuff - but I must say it is exceedingly entertaining, as well.  This is a film that kids will love, teens will be able to identify with, and most adults will find very entertaining.  The laughs are plentiful, the special effects are right on the money, and the emotional aspects of this coming of age story play extremely well.  All of the principals may be superheroes or sidekicks, but they are also very human characters with many of the same problems we all share.  I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish.

B000DZIGDU|4.0|Let's admit it: the kid can act. Jake Gyllenhaal is quickly showing everyone what a great actor he is, with this, and much more notably, his recent Oscar snub for Brokeback Mountain (though how much of a snub it actually was is up to debate, I preferred some recognition for the great character actor Paul Giamatti, but Clooney deserves some recognition as well, especially with what he has been accomplishing as of late).  But back to the film, I like it for what it tries to be. Let's be honest here, this is no Apocalypse Now, no Thin Red Line. This movie knows what it is trying to be: a meaningful war film. Now, some might be turned off by this notion, but I really like it and admire it, especially considering there are only a handful of parts that seem so contrived and obviously done for the sole purpose of being \\"cinematic\\" that they fall apart (like when everyone is shooting their gun in the sky looking angry at the camera, I mean, come on, those bullets gotta be going somewhere).  But aside from that, Jarhead has some great images (really great images, like when the oilfields are set on fire) and awesome acting done by the actors (like Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx, and, of course, Gyllenhaal). Although I do question Sarsgaard's casting, he doesn't seem the buff Marine type to me, and the way he speaks a too cultured, but he manages to pull it off somehow, and extremely well to boot.  So in summary, Jarhead is a well-shot, well-acted, merit-seeking film that is well worth a watch.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|5 Stars <br /> <br />Personally, this series is so good that a college course can be made about it.  I paid full price for this video and feel the money was well spent.  I treasure my WWII movies, books, and videos.  So, I fully pay attention to the quality of my purchase.  This mini-series is well worth the money and is a valuable addition to my video library. <br /> <br />I had first seen this series on PBS back in the mid-70s (they got it from the BBC).  This show totally changed my views of both Russia and Britain's view in WWII.  It was with great delight that I found this series had made the transfer to DVD.  It's quality was high and there were expansions to the episodes of the final solution.  Regrettably, Sir Lawrence Olivier passed away and the new episodes do not have his haunting narrations. <br /> <br />I had never completely understood how much Russia suffered in WWII.  Well, when you watch this DVD series you'll find out that Russia would lose 250,000 soldiers at a time.  That is a complete army group.  If such a thing would happen to a modern nation it would wreck its military.  Perhaps modern China could lose an Army group in fighting.  Russia haemorrhaged Army groups in 1941 to 1943.  The DVDs of Barbarossa and Stalingrad are worth the price of the whole collection. <br /> <br />Some people don't like the fact that there isn't more videos on America in this series.  I will defend the British position.  First, America didn't get into the war until near 1942 (7 December 1941).  Second, nearly everybody lost more soldiers than America.  Now, I agree with the American logic in WWII:  give the Brits and Russians all the arms they want and let them do the fighting and dying.  The cold fact is 2 out of every 3 German soldiers were killed by the Soviets in WWII.  France, Britain, America, and the rest of the allies got the rest.  It was Soviets that bled the Germans white in the fields of Russia. <br /> <br />The episode on the Fall of France should be required viewing of all high school students.  The reason France fell to Germany was not by lack of a military.  France had more tanks, ships, and aircraft than Germany had in 1940.  However, France had a government with no political will and the citizens of that nation had no hope.  Instead of \\"on to Berlin\\", like in 1914 it was \\"lets get it over with\\" in 1939.  The bottom line is the French people quietly cooperated with the German occupiers in the post 1940 period.  That episode of the DVD is priceless. <br /> <br />Next, the this series give some extremely good credit to the USA for winning the battles in the Pacific.  Two episodes are devoted to Java Sea, Coral Sea, Midway, and the Solomons.  One episode is given to the American and Japanese naval battles of 1944 to 1945.  The producers did an excellent job covering the Great Mariana's Turkey shoot.  The only part that was not covered was the gallant destroyer attack by Taffy 3 that saved the landing at the Philippines.  This series only had so much time and you can't cover everything. <br /> <br />The parts on the final solution should not be watched by children younger than 12 years old unless you want children with nightmares.  Why people like Stephen King horror is beyond this poster when you can watch the parts on the final solution and the reality comes home; people do horror just fine with out the devils help.   <br /> <br />I also liked the videos on war time Japan.  At first it starts like Japan has a chance against the USA.  However, after Midway and the meat grinding campaign of the Solomon's the efforts of Japan looks more and more pathetic.  While America was manufacturing bombers and Atomic weapons Japan was training women how to fight with bamboo spears.  Sir Lawrence Olivier's voice ends with \\"the end came, mushroom shaped, and inevitable.\\" <br /> <br />This video series is far better in quality and scale than the 1990 series \\"The Civil War\\".  You will see actual interviews with Adolph Speer, \\"Bomber\\" Harris, James Steward, and many other leaders or veterans of the war. <br /> <br />Actually, this DVD series is 10 stars.  However, Amazon.com will allow only 5.  If you are a WWII buff you'll love this series.     <br />

twenty hours. <br />Then she'll be woken.  <br />Romeo would be there to greet her. <br /> <br />All she had to do is drink if off after the setting of the sun.  <br />And the plan will take effect.  <br />The past violent occurances will have been nothing but a dream. <br />It all seemed pretty perfect.  <br /> <br />The Friar arrives the following morning to the Capulet's mansion.  <br />Tragedy has beset them.  <br />Things are in total disarray. <br />Juliet can't possibly get married today! <br />He finds Juliet in a death like state.  <br />The plan was working. <br />He'd send letters to Romeo to tell him of their foolproof scheme. <br />He only prayed that's he'd get them in time.  <br />Before it was too late.  <br /> <br />Romeo is visited at Mantua.  <br />But happy news is not what the messenger is implying.  <br />Juliet's life is over.  <br />There was no letter.  <br />Romeo must join her.  <br /> <br />He travels back into Verona walls.  <br />He's been spotted by a circling helicopter.  <br />Romeo pays for a vile of poison. <br />So deadly it will send your temperature soaring.  <br />His blood will be boiling.  <br /> <br />Romeo then makes his way to the tomb enterance.  <br />A gun in his hand he takes a prisoner hostage.  <br />Any sudden moves and his brains would be  <br />splattered in an ugly mess on the pavement.  <br />Don't make him use this! <br /> <br />At last Romeo gets to the enterance unscathed.  <br />He hurries inside to be greeted by darkness. <br />Except for Juliet's tomb. <br />Thousands of candles had all been lighted.  <br />Romeo's resting place had been decided.  <br />No one would ever spoil the love they shared between them. <br /> <br />After some astute observation of a face <br />Not yet ravaged by death.  <br />Romeo seals his lips with a kiss.  <br />The poison - He drinks it. <br />His life will soon be over.  <br /> <br />Juliet opens her eyes and grasps Romeo's hand. <br />But it is too late.  <br />He'd taken the poison.  <br />Romeo's fatal action had been fulfilled. <br />The poison had worked.  <br />Romeo's life was taken.  <br />His soul was in heaven.  <br />Under lock and key. <br />In God's possession.  <br /> <br />His final sight Juliet's eyes staring back at him.  <br />Oh if only he'd waited.  <br />They'd be together once more.  <br />Juliet could have saved him! <br /> <br />So Juliet takes his gun and points it at her head.  <br />Things will never be the same.  <br />Living a life heartbroken.  <br />She pulls the trigger.  <br />Sayonnara. <br /> <br />Before too long everyone will know. <br />Of the sad tragic tale of poor Juliet and her Romeo. <br />Thanks to a man called William Shakespere.  <br />We salute you.  <br />And a man called Baz Luhrmann. <br />The genius behind the camera.  <br />To create this groundbreaking picture for us.  <br />Of which can never be bettered. <br />And so it is all ended.  <br />Until the next time we see it.
B00003CXCW|5.0|A poor young Hollywood writer, Joe Gillis, pulls into the drive of a Hollywood estate to find the burial of a chimpanzee in progress. <br /> <br />The estate belongs to Norma Desmond, a forgotten silent-film star, who lives there with devoted servant/butler & ex-husband, Max. <br /> <br />Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) has written a remake of SALOME and wants Joe Gillis (Bill Holden) to help her make it ready for the big screen. <br /> <br />During the course of the months, Norma falls madly in love with Joe, who is also MANY years her junior. <br /> <br />This story has the most drama to it that I've ever seen! <br /> <br />The story begins with a dead Joe Gillis in the pool and is told in flashback from his point of view. <br /> <br />There's a reason this movie has lasted so long.

B000AY74OG|4.0|For a 3 year old boy, this ranks right up there with Nemo, Monsters Inc, Shrek (the first one), Dinosaurs, and Ice Age. And, this movie consistently guess more out-loud laughs from him than any of those. <br /> <br />He loves the little additional penguin short at the beginning and he starts laughing uncontrollably during it. The laughs come back again while the animals sing Marty Happy Birthday and a dozen other places culminating with him singing, dancing, and laughing all at once during \\"I like to move it move it.\\" <br /> <br />So are there a few downsides? <br />Yes, at some point, we'll want him to stop singing \\"you look like a monkey and you smell like one too\\" at birthday parties. <br />And, I hope he's not still singing \\"I live to move it move it\\" in his teens. <br />On a slightly more serious note, we did have trouble the first few days after he first saw this getting him not to spit out beverages like the animals do in a couple of scenes. It's only funny in the movie, not at the dinner table. ;)
B000002H33|5.0|Master Of Puppets is an immortal classic, a defining moment in metal's history. This is the sound of youthful fury that knows how to play guitar really, really well. This is the greatest accomplishment thrash metal has ever achieved. And above all, it rocks. <br /> <br />1986 was arguably the golden year for thrash metal. Between Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\" and Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells...\\" it would have been great enough, but throw this into the mix, the best of the three, and you have a hallmark year. The way I see it, \\"Master...\\" was the first genuinely mature heavy metal album, addressing real issues such as drug abuse, war and religious corruption. The technical proficiency of each member is dazzling, and they all know it. With huge instrumental sections and solos populating the whole album, by the time the 54 minutes are up you'll be picking your jaw up off the floor. James Hetfield's voice was also in it's prime here, suitably gruff to compliment the albums general atmosphere. What's also remarkable is the variety shown between songs, another symptom that this is a true masterpiece. The songs range from thrash attacks, like \\"Battery,\\" to fist-pumping hammer-fests, guaranteed to get you headbanging like \\"Leper Messiah,\\" to the surprisingly emotional instrumental \\"Orion.\\" This also stands out as being a great work as, despite the fact that it is fast and brutal enough that it shuld please fans of even the most vicious metal out there, it's still reasonably accessible - that's not something many bands are capable of making. The best song on here is probably the epic \\"Disposable Heroes.\\" All in all, an indispensible classic. You can't call yourself a music fan without it.
B00097DX3U|4.0|AudioSlave's self-titled debut is the best rock album of the decade so far. So to say that 2nd CD \\"Out of Exile\\" doesn't live up to it isn't the usual \\"sophomore slump.\\" Out of Exile is still fantasic and maybe after a few more weeks it will grow on me. <br /> <br />Chris Cornell still rocks the vocals and Tom Morello's guitar work is every bit as his best with Rage Against the Machine. But if I have a complaint with this CD is that there's less variety from tune to tune, it's a little more monotone, and I'd say a little less edgy.
B000002MZ6|5.0|My favourite album.  Mike Oldfeild's greatest musical achievement.  Every track on this album (except the last track) is pure brilliance, with every song in perfect juxtaposition with each other.  I have never heard anything as good or better since this album.  Technically brilliant, each song is performed with artistic and emotional significance with tunes that are easily memorable.  When seeing Mike Oldfield live in concert, most of the songs that he performed were from Songs of Distant Earth.  Songs such as 'Crystal Clear', 'Let There Be Light', 'Tubular World' and 'Supernova' actually made people in the audience teary eyed.  I was surprised that everyone one around me had tears running down there faces from this performance.  I have never seen people react this way to a live performance before, this gives strong evidence of how powerful the music in this album is.  I have been a fan of Mike Oldfield for a long time now and have all of his albums, but Songs of Distant Earth is without a doupt his best and greatest album.<br /><br />Mike Oldfield is a musical genius and Songs of Distant Earth is a perfect example of that genius.
B000000WA4|5.0|Don't let Billy Corgan's whiny voice or the Pumpkins \\"teen angst\\" label keep you away from some great music. I am 21 now and have moved away from popular alt-rock, but I haven't outgrown the Pumpkins. I think their music is truly special and you owe it to yourself to give them a listen. Many bands may have the emotional intensity, but very few bands can shape that intensity into such unique and uncategorizable music. <br /> <br />Mellon Collie has some of the Pumpkins' best songs, but it also has a fair number of songs which I find boring or annoying. But I am giving it five stars anyway because the sum total of this effort is so much better than most else that's out there. In my opinion, Siamese Dream is the best Pumpkins' album, and Pisces Iscariot is better overall because it's more balanced (fewer stinkers). Gish is about on par.  <br /> <br />Here's my breakdown (1-5 stars scale). <br /> <br />DAWN TO DUSK (Disk 1) <br /> <br />-- Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness (4): very pleasant piano opening. sets the mood perfectly. <br /> <br />-- Tonight, Tonight (4): a blast of emotion (nostalgia? optimism?). Corgan gets at something totally unique here and the string instrumentation is a stroke of genius, although the song gets a bit repetitive musically speaking. <br /> <br />-- Jellybelly (4): one of their best \\"hard\\" songs. pure energy. <br /> <br />-- Zero (3): strange Halloween-esque song. Catchy but borders on juvenile. <br /> <br />-- Here is No Why (5): rhythmic guitar opening builds to a killer climactic guitar solo. One of my favorites. <br /> <br />-- Bullet with Butterfly Wings (3): radio hit. Too high school. A shame that the Pumpkins are known for this song more than any other. <br /> <br />-- To Forgive (4): nice ambience, but a little too slow. <br /> <br />-- An Ode to No One (3): intense but too frenetic for my tastes <br /> <br />-- Love (3): interesting fuzzy sound, builds to a highly distorted \\"solo\\" of sorts, but most of the song is relatively boring. <br /> <br />-- Cupid de Locke (1): experimental song which I find annoying. Some may like it. <br /> <br />-- Galapagos (3): slow, haunting feel. another good \\"mood piece\\" <br /> <br />-- Muzzle (5): if this isn't the sound of happiness, I don't know what is. Short and sweet.  <br /> <br />-- Porcelina of the Vast Oceans (3): experimental piece which has its moments but drags on too long. Starts off great though. <br /> <br />-- Take Me Down (3): Iha's \\"Blew Away\\" on Pisces Iscariot is so much better. <br /> <br />TWILIGHT TO STARLIGHT (Disk 2) <br /> <br />-- Where Boys Fear to Tread (4): heavy song with classic guitar riff. Killer opening. An aggressive song if there ever was one. <br /> <br />-- Bodies (4): lots energy and power chords, but this one gets old <br /> <br />-- Thirty-three (3): sentimental song. sorta boring, in my opinion. <br /> <br />-- In the Arms of Sleep (4): nice low-key song. almost folksy.  <br /> <br />-- 1979 (5): wow, what a special song. You've heard it on the radio. Give it a close listen. The lyrics to this song are first-class poetry (about nostalgia, I think). This song is genius. <br /> <br />-- Tales of a Scorched Earth (3): loud and boring <br /> <br />-- Thru the Eyes of Ruby (4): epic song. a huge sound. <br /> <br />-- Stumbeline (2): boring, annoying <br /> <br />-- X.Y.U. (2): too frenetic. noisy and chaotic.  <br /> <br />-- We Only Come Out a Night (1): very annoying song. Corgan takes big risks and falls hard when he fails. <br /> <br />-- Beautiful (4): starts out uninspired, but turns into quite the love ballad. Hints of The Beatles. <br /> <br />-- Lily My One and Only (4): lighthearted song (about a peeping tom?). Another good one. <br /> <br />-- By Starlight (4): sad, slow song. Starts off soft and builds to an emotional outpouring of sorts. Better than the fluff they play on \\"adult contemporary\\" radio stations. <br /> <br />-- Farewell and Goodnight (3): sleepy song suits its title and lyrics. but sleepy means rather boring ......
B0001US62I|1.0|I loved Angel Heart.  I ordered the unrated (x) version from a seller who works with Amazon.  I received the R rated version. I then ordered the special edition from amazon directly which stated it was the unrated version.  However, it was also rated R.  It looks like I will have to buy it here locally.  The movie was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />If you are going to buy it from either a seller or Amazon, make sure you are getting the correct version.

It is well written- altho at times tends to be rather hard to understand the meaning but with help of excellent examples it does become clear.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Miyazaki Hayao's first big film Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds was released in 1984. Based upon Miyazaki's manga, it follows the futuristic barren wasteland that Earth has become, ravaged by industrial toxins and radiation. Small pockets of civilization perch on the edge of the Sea of Decay, among them Nausicaa's Valley of the Winds, untouched by toxic mold spores. Nausicaa is a young princess with the ability to talk to animals and insects, using charms to keep them from destroying themselves and others. She is a fearless leader of her people, who wants to stop the bloodshed between warring factions and stop the murder of giant insects such as the Ohmu. Although altruistic, she possesses a dangerous, unpredictable rage. There is a prophecy in the land that a \\"...a person clad in blue standing in a golden field  will find the bond between humanity and the earth, and lead the people to a pure land...\\"<br /><br />The Valley is threatened when a ship from neighbouring Pejite crashes and releases toxic mold spores, along with a much more dangerous foe: one of the Giant God Soldiers responsible for the Seven Days of Fire, in which the world was nearly destroyed by nuclear radiation. Nausicaa finds the princess of Pejite inside, chained and mortally wounded.<br /><br />The Valley is threatened by the appearance of Princess Kushana of Torumekia, who seizes power in a coup, killing Nausicaa's father. She seeks to resurrect the Giant God Soldier, whose nuclear weapons can destroy both enemies and the hordes of destructive insects that ravage the land. Nausicaa escapes, and must save her beloved valley from a stampede of enraged Ohmu...<br /><br />The story, visuals, music, and sheer creativity are simply amazing. This is one of Miyazaki's most original, moving efforts, and I've seen nearly all his films from Nausicaa to Howl's Moving Castle. His frequent lament on the destruction of nature is at its most poignant here, the small seeds of hope blossoming into renewal. Visuals are strongly drawn from medieval costumes and castles in the Valley, the ships look like something from Star Trek, and the insects gave me nightmares (and I thought the giant cockroaches in my office were scary (!). I hope to get my hands on a copy of the original manga (in Japanese) to read more fully into the lush backstory of Nausicaa. Poetic, spiritual, and unique, this is my favourite Miyazaki film.wn from medieval costumes and castles in the Valley, the ships look like something from Star Trek, and the insects gave me nightmares (and I thought the giant cockroaches in my office were scary (!).

Lorelai is almost old enough to be her sister than her mother. Lorelai is thirty-eight but she looks like sixteen or seventeen. If she went to a nightclub a lot of people thought she was a teenager. Rory is twenty-four she looks fifteen and sixteen.

David Lloyd is his equal at creating images that match the mood of Moore's fantastic stories. This book, written from 1981 to 1988, is their masterpiece --- and the inspiration for the movie by the Wachowski brothers (creators of the 'Matrix' trilogy.)<br /><br />There are technical reasons why newcomers to this genre can be excited by 'V for Vendetta.' Unlike old-fashioned comics, there are no panels that signal action --- no \\"Blam!\\" and \\"Pow!\\" and \\"Oooof!\\" And there are no \\"thought bubbles\\" to take us inside the characters' heads so we can share what passes for thinking. The result is a streamlined book of considerable beauty.<br /><br />More to the point, this format lets Moore tell a story that is long on ideas and short on action --- and is still absolutely thrilling. In post-nuclear-holocaust England, \\"Leader\\" has the people under total surveillance. And the government propaganda machine --- the \\"Voice of Fate\\" --- is the only media permitted. There are no dissenters, and yet it seems that citizens are constantly being arrested for \\"terrorism.\\" For all but the very privileged, England is Hell on earth.<br /><br />Will V take down the government? Who, really, is V? And what destiny does V plan for Evey?<br /><br />It would have been easy to invoke the dystopias of Orwell and Huxley and portray this fascist state as the logical extension of Margaret Thatcher's government. But as Moore knows better than most writers, Fascism is essentially a theory of government that sets order above liberty and regards politics as the agent of business. Moore grasps the bitter irony of the Allies' victory over Hitler and Mussolini; in the decades after the war, the winners consistently traded their freedoms for \\"security.\\" By the l980s, most people in \\"free\\" countries were unfree drones, addicted to mass entertainment and quite happy to believe any lie their governments told them.<br /><br />\\"V\\" is not exactly a traditional liberator. He's an anarchist, and a very refined anarchist at that --- he believes that every citizen must take responsibility for himself. And much of the novel consists of his ongoing dialogue with Evey about politics and philosophy. Heavy going? I'd say exhilarating. And not just because Moore is a sharp thinker who avoids banality. I'm equally dazzled by the range of his quotations and references ---The Rolling Stones, Alistair Crowley, William Blake, Martha & the Vandellas.<br /><br />I fear that most readers --- and film audiences --- will miss the subtleties and hear only the remarkable (for a corporation like Warner Brothers, anyway) advertising slogan for the movie: \\"The people should not be afraid of their government. The government should be afraid of the people.\\" The big takeaway of the book is more intellectual: \\"Ideas are bulletproof.\\"<br /><br />Who should read this book? It's obvious: Anyone who's interested in large ideas, dramatically expressed.<br /><br />'V for Vendetta' is also an ideal book for teenage slackers --- if you know of a smart kid with a bad attitude and a disdain for adult authority, you will do him/her a big favor with the gift of this paperback. Yeah, there's some sex. There's worse on network TV. But I can't think of another book that packs as many bright ideas and sharp speeches in the context of a thriller. And in a comic, yet.<br /><br />'V for Vendetta' is an amazing, one-of-a-kind reading experience.'s interested in large ideas, dramatically expressed.  <br />  <br />'V for Vendetta' is also an ideal book for teenage slackers --- if you know of a smart kid with a bad attitude and a disdain for adult authority, you will do him/her a big favor with the gift of this paperback.

0131479415|5.0|A critical success factor for an agile team is the degree to which collaboration permeates every activity and interaction.  This is especially true of 'project management' activities.  All members of the cross-functional team (subject matter experts, technical experts, analysts, testers, etc) must be fully engaged in the regular estimating, planning, and tracking activities, often for the first time in their professional careers.  Mike Cohn's Agile Estimating and Planning book deserves all the praise that it is receiving.  I fully agree with the other 5-star reviewers, and want to highlight that the significant achievement of this book is that it speaks to the entire cross-functional team. Like Allen, the developer in the case study, hard core techies will clearly understand, and get excited about the planning process.
B0002CHIJW|4.0|\\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" is one of the most notorious films to play so-called \\"Grindhouse\\" movie houses during the 70's, and most critics that bothered to see it dismissed it as reprehensible garbage.  Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert in particular hated it, and even the audience the film supposedly attracted.  Considering it boasts the dubious honor of containing the longest--and most graphic--rape scene in film history (not counting porn) seems to justify their reaction.  But wait!  ISOYG is also the tale of one woman's bloody revenge against her attackers, and its supporters even maintain that it's actually a pro-feminist movie.  Watching it, one can easily imagine that director Meir Zarchi honestly thought that was what he was doing.  I kinda think he was trying to have it both ways: to make a bottom feeding exploitation film that was also a feminist statement (The original title was \\"Day of the Woman,\\" but the more, um, declarative replacement doesn't seem designed to attract serious cineastes).<br /><br />The film's heroine, Jenny Hill (Camille Keaton) is a writer who leaves her ritzy New York digs to complete her novel in the peace and quiet of rural Connecticut.  There she is accosted by a gang of lowlifes who rape her and leave her for dead.  From then on Jenny becomes a heartless killing machine, concocting a plot to seduce the men and brutally kill them.  I don't think it would giving anything away to say that a gun, a noose and an outboard motor are involved, or that the most vivid scene involves one of the perps naked in a bathtub when a knife...well, you can probably guess what happens.<br /><br />Even though Keaton spends most of the movie completely naked, it's clearly told from her point of view, and even though the rape is graphic and protracted, it's anything but a turn-on.  It's as brutal, ugly and even realistic as what you can imagine an actual rape to be like, so the audience is rooting for these scumbags to get what's coming to them.  Then again, the movie can also be seen as a male assault on feminism: the heroine is a free-spirited writer (read: intellectual) from \\"evil\\" New York City who doesn't even wear a bra!  Certain kinds of men (like the ones who presumably go to grindhouse movies) are threatened by women like this, and ISOYG could be seen as their fantasy (or nightmare).  I myself like to think of it as pro-woman, but Zarchi, it would seem, was at least canny enough to provide enough ambiguity to maximize its chances for success.<br /><br />In any event, ISOYG is definitely not devoid of artistic merit or craft, as some of its critics contend.  It's deliberately paced, with documentary-style footage and no soundtrack music (it even has some stunning photography of the lake and forest it was shot at).  Watched from today's point of view, this could almost be a kind of gory Dogma 95 production!  Heck, it's as provocative as Lars Von Trier likes to think he is.  The disc features a small archive of articles (both pro and con) about the movie, and a commentary track from Zarchi himself.  A bonus commentary, by exploitation film critic Joe Bob Briggs, is both entertaining and surprisingly astute.  So if you're a fan of such \\"modern\\" fare as \\"Saw,\\" \\"Hostel\\" or most especially Rob Zombie's \\"The Devil's Rejects,\\" this is the movie you should check out.  It's disturbing enough to wipe that silly smirk off your face for good.in, the movie can also be seen as a male assault on feminism: the heroine is a free-spirited writer (read: intellectual) from \\"evil\\" New York City who doesn't even wear a bra!

0393327655|2.0|I was intrigued by the premise of the book but quickly noticed that the author's view of religion is too one sided to be persuasive. Reason is good, religion is bad-that is pretty much as sophisticated as it gets. Harris also has no historical sense. Why has the period since the enlightenment been the most bloody in history? Can we blame WW I or II on religion? Would the Civil Rights Movements of our time have been as powerful without religious motivations behind many participants? Yes, religion often produces horrors, but so did the \\"best and brightest\\" with their reason applied to Vietnam. Beware anyone who tells you they say what others don't dare to say. In this case, Harris says what many commentators say about Islam. He argues that the world is better off when Bush and Blair have the bomb rather than Saddam and Bin Laden. That is true but does not mean that \\"we\\" must change the way Muslims think to survive on this planet. It is fine to be an atheist, but blaming the worlds problems on religion is intellectually and empirically foolish.
B00009Y2K9|5.0|...who gave this collection 5 stars, but i can unequivocally say that I play it time after time and, each time, i find something more to love about it.

B0001ZMWQO|4.0|VOOP!VOOP!VOOP!VOOP! over and over! That BEAT! It's insistent!  And that makes a great pop song - insistence!  Franz Ferdinand have managed to spread it successfully over two albums now, but I prefer this, their debut, because the songs sound the most alike, and that's actually a strength in this kind of music!  I don't want a slower song or some experimental new sounds breaking up the VOOPS!  However, their second album is great, too.  This first one is just more FUN due to the VOOP quotient!  (I can see it now:  review not helpful, in droves...) It seems that Franz Ferdinand have spawned or are a part of a movement of similar bands:  Kaiser Chiefs, Hot Hot Heat, The Killers, The Futureheads, Bloc Party (the BEST of the lot!)...They are all really good bands even though they share some of the same sounds.  If you like ANY of these bands, you simply MUST check out the albums that influenced them the most, and are equally great (or better!) albums:  DRUMS N WIRES(1979) by XTC (also check out WHITE MUSIC(1977) by XTC, but DRUMS N WIRES is the best of the two - a 5 star classic!) and ENTERTAINMENT!(1979)by GANG OF FOUR.  The latter is a bit more raw and harsh (with political lyrics) and that GANG OF FOUR style of guitar playing came from John Lennon's playing on the 1970 song, I FOUND OUT, on the album, PLASTIC ONO BAND, if anyone wonders!  Anyway, if you love Franz Ferdinand of any of the other bands I mentioned, you'll love the albums I mentioned, especially DRUMS N WIRES!  And vice versa, you XTC  fans!
0634049011|5.0|Barret Tagliarino shows great wisdom in this 3-tiered method of storing information for necessary recall. Speaking, writing and touching really helped me to put the notes of guitar music together logically and quickly. I know I can now find any note on the fretboard, and, with a little consistent practice, will be able to do so \\"on the fly.\\" As with any learning program, Tagliarino's will take time and practice, but if there is a better way to get the fingerboard down, I've never seen it.
B000002LK1|5.0|Can you think of another DM Album that is as good from the first song to the last? There is not one bad song on this 9 track CD! This was the APEX to DM's music. Sadly, after Alan left, I did not enjoy their music as much...after Alan left I only liked...Its no Good (Ultra) and Precious (Playing the Angel). I thought Exciter BOMBED. Too bad they didnt stick with what they did best. Listen to Violator, SOFAD, MFM and BC and you will see...DM without Alan just isn't as good.  <br /> <br />

B000E1YVZU|3.0|I'm a theater kid, and a HUGE RENT fan. Like any theatre kid knows, RENT is like... \\"the show\\". You know every word to every song, every move in \\"La Vie Boheme\\"...... but the movie, which was strongly inticipated....... just fell short. It wasn't good enough for RENT. what i did enjoy was that it made the people real. They were in a real subway, a real cafe, a real apartment, but thats just about it. Im glad the kept the original broadway cast, that was very wise, but sorry Mr. Collumbus, it just fell short.<br /><br />Will hollywood ever be able to adapt a current broadway musical to the big screen, and do it well?<br /><br />the only one that worked was Chicago. RENT and Phantom just arent doing it for me.
0201633612|5.0|I have been doing real-time C/C++ systems for the last 25 years (out of a 40 year prog. career). The I have worked on systems have gotton bigger and bigger. The concepts of the Design Patterns books become more important to me as the systems got larger. <br /> <br />The point is that Design Patterns may seem irrelevant to programmers working on smaller projects. <br /> <br />It seems to me that the larger systems have more objects dedicated to work flow, collaboration, and policy than smaller systems. For example, a wireless switch project I worked on had radios, mobile stations, vlans, etc. but the majority of the system objects seemed to be dedicated to how these devices interacted rather than on support for the devices themseleves. Unfortunately, for this project, this behavior was stuffed into the classes associated with the devices. This caused class bloat and those annoying little \\"do nothing\\" classes. <br /> <br />The design patterns book gives suggestion about how to separate classes into smaller chunks while maintaining a rational and systematic collaboration. In my copies, those end of section for creational, structural and behaviorial pattern have little yellow postits for fast access. <br /> <br />To remember the behaviorial patterns, I came up with: crazy cat interest in mickey mouse on stacked salad tasty vitals. <br /> <br />One of the problems with C++, especially for real time use, is lack of a widely known set of classes that could serve to make design patterns \\"more real\\" to more RT C++ programmers. In the past 6 months I started to learn python/twisted/nevow for testing, tools, and personal organization (email, web site). Python and the class libraries that go along with use many design patterns, for example use of factories in web servers, templates for HTML parsers, blah, blah. Anyone who knows C++ will easily learn Python. <br /> <br />I own 2 copies of Design Patterns, one for home and one for work.
B000AA305M|4.0|David Gray reached critical and commercial acclaim with his 4th album, the 1999 album \\"White Ladder\\", a blockbuster in the UK that burned slowly in ths US but ultimately made him a big indie star in the US a year later, and deservedly so. His next album, 2002's \\"A New Day at Mignight\\", was a hit-and-miss affair, and now comes his latest.<br /><br />\\"Life in Slow Motion\\" (10 tracks, 45 min.) retreats from \\"New Day\\" to bring a \\"White Ladder\\"-like sound. Some of the songs certainly achieve that goal, if not that same standard. First single \\"The One I Love\\" is a great \\"mood\\" tune. \\"Nos Da Cariad\\" is the best tune on the album, with a nice up-beat tempo. Other standouts include \\"Hospital Foods\\", another upbeat track. Yet too many songs are stuck in the same \\"ballad\\"-like atmosphere, without actually delivering.<br /><br />While \\"Life in Slow Motion\\" is certainly an improvement over \\"New Day\\", it simply does not match the heights and musical and critical ambition of \\"White Ladder\\", to which Gray's output will be eternally compared to. (It reminds me of Damien Rice's dilemma, having delivered an outstainding album \\"O\\", with no subsequent musical equivalent. In fact Rice has not released anything since \\"O\\".) That said, David Gray will be visiting Cincinnati shortly, and I am looking forward to see how he translates his songs in concert.
B000007VLL|4.0|Some songs are super but some of them are not. Even though some songs are \\"old-fashioned\\" I liked that. It's inevitable that some of the compositions are less dynamic than leading ones, which is why you could skip some songs.
0790732203|5.0|I remeber watching this when it first came out, and I can't even remember how many times I have seen it since then. This wasn't just another \\"teeny film\\" of that era, but a well crafted, groundbreaking cult classic. While many say TAPS is what put Cruise on the radar, I say this propelled him into superstardom.     In fact, it was very \\"risque\\" for the time, given many of the scenes, especially the legendary Subway tryst between Cruise and De Mornay. How many film makers and directors would have done that back in '83? I would like to say not too many. In addition, the music was awesome. Songs by Phil Collins, Prince and of course, Bob Seger and others made this movie a hit!     I also enjoyed it, because as an only son myself, I remember when my parents went out for the evening or an overnight trip, I would raid dad's liquor cabinet, take a spin in his car and blast his stereo. No, I didn't drive his car into the river, nor did I didn't have a party like Joel, but It shows you that teens are teens. Frankly, even if they tried to make a similar movie today, it would't even hold a match to \\"Risky Business\\".
0790734850|5.0|I liked the movie a lot, despite of the fact that it's quite disturbing and not easy to watch. All the actors are excellent! The DVD's quality is superb!
B000BTJDGC|5.0|In this review I want to focus more on the one who gave it omnipotence, but altogether, the movie was outstanding. I had read a review on one site about how much crap it was and immediately I was disappointed until I saw it again and made several observations.  Jennifer Carpenter did so much for the portrayal of Emily.  She really DID make her body stiff and she really DID contort her body in such ways.  And as far as dialogue acting...it was phenominal.  She really spoke those languages as if she really knew ALL of them.  Though reading about her (Jennifer's) stance as a \\"believer or not\\" was quite ambiguous to me...she was the PERSONIFIED mantra of Emily Rose's faith.  I spoiled the movie so much all ready to others I can only refuse to do it here...or, maybe I have...but I came away from it extremely effected.  Laura Linney did a GREAT job as a brilliant lawyer too self-absorbed in her career to ask questions such as the movie does.  Laura Linney was great and brilliant...and the leading lady.  But Jennifer Carpenter \\"sold\\" the movie to me- dark, enthralling, sometimes very painful to see, but altogether enlightening. Jennifer Carpenter is great.  She's the star of this film.
B00005JLT5|1.0|I am not deep into what directors do or have done in their past, I don't give a tinker's dam about how critically acclaimed someone's previous work has been.  \\"The Pianist\\" is a movie that made me mad as hell at the main character.  If you want to watch a movie about a guy who stands by and does nothing but serve himself throughout the Holocaust, let's his entire family be sent away to camps and hides at every chance, this is your movie.  I find nothing redeeming in this movie or in the person of its main character.  I was left with the overall impression that his will to save his own skin at all costs was his primary function during the war years - the movie does illustrate that quite well.  Instead of participating in the Warsaw Uprising, the brave piano player hides.  When the one German officer in the world who's kind to him and saves his life toward the end of an agonizingly long movie, how does he repay the kindness?  By letting that German officer die in a Soviet labor camp without lifting a finger to help him - some hero.  The movie is very well made, but it's one that left me angry rather than sympathetic.  Schindler's List is a far better movie of personal triumph and real heroism in the face of the Holocaust.  As a history enthusiast and not an Academy Awards movie critic, this movie disgusted me.  Why waste time with such a pathetic character as this when there are many genuinely inspiring tales which could've been told?
B000001ESN|5.0|Hey Amazon! Could you maybe this time keep from deleting my review!! You've done it twice!!! The album that really got me interested in Rush was Moving Pictures, but soon after I gave Permanent Waves a whirl, and it's my favorite, along with Moving Pictures and 2112. For this release Rush decided to get away from the side long conceptual pieces (like the previous album HEMISPHERES), and stick with shorter non conceptual songs, but it would have two songs that were about 7:30 and about 9:30 minutes in length. Now, let's get to the review. My least favorite song is &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot;, but I'm not saying it's a really bad song, just that I haven't yet really got into it yet. The rest of the recording is gold. Of course the songs &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot; are what brought me to the album because of all the radio play they got, but really, my two favorites are &quot;Natural Science&quot; and &quot;Entre Nous&quot;. They are just amazing songs in my book! The Geddy Lee penned &quot;Different Strings&quot; is also a superb song. It would have been nice if Geddy could have helped Neil out with the songwriting duties over the years, but Neil does a fine job in that area of expertise. I think this album was about the first Rush album that got a lot of radio play because the songs &quot;Freewill&quot; and &quot;The Spirit Of Radio&quot; were really assessible hit songs that a lot of the public really liked. The remastering job seems like it was a pretty good success. In some places it could have been mastered at a higher volume because I had to crank up my car cd player kind of high, but it still sounds better than my mid 80's issue did. If you're new to Rush this sounds like a perfect place to start, but the cds Moving Pictures and 2112 would be great also. Enjoy!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Wonderful story line.   Great character development. This is not your regular spin-n-span sci fi; this is a set of shows that shows how life might really be in the future.   Recommend it highly.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Is this real? no...it can't be...<br /><br />I have never heard such brutality and beauty before in my life. Nergal, Seth, and Orion know what the hell they are doing. from Conquer All, to Slaves Shall Serve etc the album reaks with intensity and brutality like you wouldn't believe!!! HIGHLY recommened for death metal fans, and any other extreme music you happen to like :)
B000BJS4BM|5.0|This album is by far Madonna's best, and the film clips for Hung Up and Sorry are HOT! Nearly every person I know has Confessions in their collection. <br /> <br />The Special Edition contains a book with various cool glossy photo's of Mads in her dancing tights, sprawling in different poses on the dance floor. There is also a writing pad included which you wouldn't really want to use if you want to keep it as a collecters item. There is an extra song on this CD called Fighting Spirit, I'd give this song a 7/10. <br /> <br />Overall, The album and photo's are definately worth a five star rating. The dance scene in Sydney has never been so thankful! <br /> <br />Go Mads, you rock!!  :)
006056251X|5.0|Several have already provided detailed reviews of the story and character, so all I can say is buy the book and re-read it as often as you wish.  Thank you, Ms. Kleypas for another wonderful read. Looking forward to Daisy's story in Scandal in Spring.
B00005ATQF|4.0|How my ratings work:<br />5 - I really liked/loved it<br />4 - I liked it<br />3 - Could've been better/worth a look<br />2 - Just didn't live up to the potential<br />1 - Simply awful<br /><br />I'm not that big of a Stanley Kubrick fan (he really is an acquired taste) but i really like this movie. It's like two films in one, the boot camp scene and the war. To me, the boot camp is the very best part of the film. R. Lee Ermey is brilliant as Drill Seargant Hartman, giving a funny and terrifying performance. But after that, it becomes a pretty standard war film. Still, it's an overall great film. Most likely when I purchase this film, I will watch the first half and then switch off, unless I want to watch some battle scenes. I will say that the last part of the film gets pretty intense.
0060922583|4.0|We have all seen those holograms.  Life-like, three-dimensional images projected into space with the use of a laser.   In \\"The Holographic Universe,\\"  Michael Talbot contends that objective reality as we perceive it; indeed the whole universe as we understand it, is merely an infinite series of holograms, projected by our collective conscious out of an underlying, genuine reality.   An \\"implicate\\" reality where time and space lose their meanings and the boundaries between mind and matter become permeable.  In other words, our objective reality is in essence a virtual one created by our own conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions.   Talbot uses this holographic theory to explain a number of paranormal phenomena such as telekinesis, shamanism, reincarnations, UFO encounters as well as out-of-body and near-death experiences.  He also describes how the holographic theory may explain such phenomena as spontaneous medical recoveries or even the psychosis experienced in severe mental illnesses.   <br />  <br />Talbot's writing is succinct and easy to follow.  He does a nice job of corroborating the holographic theory of universe by presenting an array of research and anecdotal evidence from a variety of sources, including noted scientists and professionals.  As intriguing as the content of this book is, it is limited by a number of overarching conclusions that are not adequately supported.   For example, Talbot presents with no convincing attempt to define consciousness, the cornerstone of his holographic theory of reality.  To this day, philosophers, psychologists, neuroscientists and neurophilosophers are still struggling to define what it means to be conscious.   Nonetheless, this book has an important message that should not be missed.  None of us knows how and why we are on this plane of existence or what the next phase is.  However, deep down in the crevices of our being, we all know that this physical and possibly virtual reality we call life is only a shortstop in an infinite journey.                                                       <br />
006056251X|5.0|I must say, that Lisa Kleypas has done it yet again. I waited for this book with very little patience and it proved that she is still one of the best.  The storyline was wonderful and stayed that way throughout the entire book.  I didn't want it to end.  <br />
B00030590I|5.0|I have to say I bought this movie simply because I heard the sound was incredible and I wanted to push my surround sound system with something new. <br /> <br />What I didn't know was that I had gone all this time without seeing this brilliant, remarkable and thought provoking movie for myself. <br /> <br />I have always been intrigued by the Asian people and their culture ever since I read Shogun years ago.   <br /> <br />If you are looking for a typical Kung Fu movie you may as well move on.  If you are looking for a movie that will leave you a different person than when you started and really make you think then this movie is for you. <br /> <br />The screen play is fantastic, the script simple yet very elegant.  The scenery and cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie to anyone. <br />
0452284937|4.0|I got the DVD & the book for Christmas, and it took me a while to actually get around to watching the film, but when I did, I wanted to read the book, and was glad to have it there, rather than hunting for it in shops/online. I read the book in a couple of hours (leaving myself with nothing to do on my lunch break at work, apart from send nonsense texts), and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was expecting the film to differ a lot from the book, but was pleased to discover that the film stuck really closely to the book, apart from the odd addition here & then, which was welcome.<br /><br />I actually lost myself in the book. I got that engrossed in it, that when I was reading it when I was waiting for my hair dye to settle in, I got a fright when I heard a noise. I was completely oblivious to everything around me, as I was transferred back to the 17th century.<br /><br />Apart from the fact it was an excellent story (kinda about unrequited love, wouldn't you say?), I also learned a few things about that century. The women covered their hair, and the curious thing that when women had a baby, they hired a nursemaid to breastfeed their babies!!! So much for bonding with your child. Apparently, at that time, it was believed that if you breastfed your own child, then you wouldn't be able to have anymore. Thank God that's not true.<br /><br />Right the way through reading this, I could totally imagine Scarlett in the role. To me, it's a big thing for me to be able to 'see' what's happening in a book, rather than just read it. I was able to play out the scenes in my head, and make up what didn't appear in the film. For example, some stuff that was left out of the film, was her sister dying from the plague, her brother appearing, why it affected her so much to see her tile being broken in half and the ending. The ending in the film was only slightly touched upon, and was expanded on in the book. There was actually a 10 year gap between Griet walking out of the house, and actually getting the pearl earrings, which I didn't feel was shown in the film. It certainly wasn't made obvious there was meant to be 10 years since her walking out. The film glossed over this bit slightly, and the ending was so much better in the book, and heartbreaking.<br /><br />Definitely one of my favourite books that I have read this year so far, and one I would definitely recommend & read again.lly getting the pearl earrings, which I didn't feel was shown in the film.

B00006CXSS|5.0|\\"Band of Brothers\\" is an accurate story produced by HBO about an elite American infantryman in combat during the Second World War in Europe.<br /><br />Unlike `Saving private Ryan' which was a 3 hours theatrical movie, `Band of Brothers' Is a TV miniseries telling a similar, yet true detailed adventure in 15 hours instead of 3.<br /><br />The writing, the directing, the details of every scene and how the story is told, the photography, the sound effects as well as the acting are all simply superb.<br /><br />If you are into, war, action or historical movies, \\"Band of Brothers\\" is surely a treat any way you put it.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I have not read the book.<br /><br />I have not seen any of the previous versions, including the infamous Colin Firth version.<br /><br />I bought this because it was on my wishlist, and we had (and still do have) a special promotion at work, which meant we were uncutting the price of nearly every other shop. So why the hell not?<br /><br />Firstly I was pleasantly surprised. After my disastrous attempts at watching some 'period' movies recently (Emma, Vanity Fair), I was preparing myself not to like this. A girl I work with, who also watched and detested Vanity Fair, also didn't enjoy this. But then I was being told by every customer buying it that they liked it.<br /><br />It took me a while, but I did eventually get around to watching it, although was disappointed to discover there was no trailer on the DVD. Plenty of other extras however.<br /><br />For some reason, Keira Knightley got an Oscar nomination for this (but lost out to Reese Witherspoon), which, upon watching the film, I didn't get, considering she mumbles most of her lines. I had to actually have the subtitles switched on to understand not only her, but the fancy olde English that was used. I had the sound turned right up, but still couldn't make much sense of it.<br /><br />But overall, the film was very good, even Keira! Jenna Malone doesn't get much of a look in, her 'big' part being that she elopes. (Not the done thing in those days.) It's good to see Keira actually smiling for a change, she rarely does. There's plenty of great scenery to detract your attention from the not-so-cute guys appearing on screen. I was really disappointed with the lack of good looking guys in this film. Why? You have Keira, Rosamund Pike, Jenna Malone & Brenda Blethyn, don't the girls need some eye candy?<br /><br />I can't really comment much on this, as it was average, perhaps reading the book, and seeing the previous versions might enlighten me a bit. It's understandable that for Keira and Matthew MacFadyen, it must have been difficult for them to step into their predecessors shoes, particularly the much-loved shoes of Colin Firth.<br /><br />There's an alternate ending, where Mr Darcy and Lizzie kiss, but it brings nothing to the film, except it was aimed at the US audiences. I feel us shivering in the UK got a better deal. The rest of the extras are alright, but not that outstanding.<br /><br />I've got my eye on the old version of Pride & Prejudice now, with Colin Firth. Should be interesting.acFadyen, it must have been difficult for them to step into their predecessors shoes, particularly the much-loved shoes of Colin Firth. <br /> <br />There's an alternate ending, where Mr Darcy and Lizzie kiss, but it brings nothing to the film, except it was aimed at the US audiences.

B0000797IO|5.0|...and surely Aniston's best and most untypecast performance to date. Darkly humorous and unltimately examining the values which allow so many western lives to be wasted.<br /><br /> The characterisations are a set of peole deeply unfulfilled and either searching desperately for real connection and exploration of their true desires and talents or succumbing to their heavily ploughed roles as best they can. No one really achieves very much other than a dark realisation that what they are desperate to escape may infact be the most strongly available route in life open to them. Some make do and mend while others faulter in the horror of their findings.<br /><br /> Thought provoking, damningly witty and terribly sad, none of Aniston's usual sugary fair here, you will see not one visible trace of Rachael Green in her performance; a formula so many of her other films has exploited to her detriment.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal displays strong signs of his emerging talent also but for me the darkly and explosively funny performance of Zooey Deschanel is the show stealer. Well worth a look, a long afterthought and analysis. It wont leave you feeling comfortable but will raise questions about the exploitations in modern and suppossed \\"free\\" lives.
B000AWYOGE|1.0|I've never claimed that a movie has been a \\"waste of my money/time\\". There has always been something I've taken away from am movie, no matter how bad, be it a song, a scene, a line. That was true until I saw \\"Dark Water\\". I left the theater angry and disappointed. This movie is NOT worthy of being called a horror film. It is not remotely scary, not even creepy. It is terribly confusing, the whole story line is just weak and the entire time I sat there I just didn't care about any of the characters. If you really must see this movie, don't even rent it, but find someone who has it and watch it. I don't even know if I can sleep with myself at night after recommending you see it, because it really was a waste of my time. Although I will never BOO a movie in the theater, I got dangerously close when the screen mercifully went black. Please don't watch this movie and expect to be 1)scared 2)frightened 3)creeped out 4)any other synonyms. You WILL be disappointed.
1400049628|4.0|Fun read, but I was a bit turned off by the authors discussion of the 'virus' that causes zombies to be zombies.  The actual survival portion was good but the best part, in my opinion, was the section on real life zombie encounters throughout history.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Well, it's the day after the Academy Awards and while I'll never begrudge Crash for winning Best Picture, especially since it was a very good film, it was Brokeback Mountain that truly spoke to me and resonated in a way that Crash didn't.<br /><br />Adapted from the short story by E. Annie Proulx, Brokeback Mountain tells the gut wrenching story of two young ranch hands who fall in love in the early 1960s.  Ang Lee maps out their relationship up to the early 80s and actors Heath Ledger and Jack Gyllenhaal who play Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist respectively, create fully formed characters each conflicted with demons, and each making different choices with equally devastating consequences.<br /><br />Debate around this movie swirls around the fact that it carries the \\"sinister\\" liberal agenda to finally demarginalize the gay lifestyle and bring it to the mainstream.  Brokeback Mountain, if you really look at it, is a statement about how you decide to live your life in the face of social strictures.  And it provides no uplifting answer.  If you try to live your life without apology like Jack, you run the risk of physical harm and if you choose to bottle it up like Ennis, you implode from the weight of your own longing.  And the film isn't just about Jack and Ennis, but how their relationship causes a ripple effect throughout the other people in their lives.<br /><br />Frankly, Brokeback Mountain is a movie whose time has come and it saddens me that Hollywood didn't fully capitalize on the zeitgeist by bestowing the film its best picture prize.  Even in the face of the Academy's snub, Brokeback Mountain still tells its powerful story.  It's beautifully shot, unfurls  very slowly but surely to its hearbreaking end and slightly optimistic coda.  Ultimately, by the end, the viewer will understand the cost of what it takes to be oneself in spite of the world, and sometimes in spite of oneself.
1931382794|5.0|To understand where I am coming from: I am a licensed cycling coach and serious cyclist.  I've been using a bicycle power meter (PowerTap) for years, and training with an indoor power-based trainer for even longer.  For full disclosure, I have also met both authors in-person, and I know one of the authors quite well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for any serious cyclist.  I gobbled it down once, and I am now on my second reading.  I have learned quite a bit on the subject by reading the book, despite my prior experience and training.<br /><br />I enjoyed and appreciated the book because:<br /><br />(1) COMPREHENSIVE!!  This is perhaps the book's best feature--nothing seems to be missing.  Every subject of which I am aware, as it relates to training with a power meter, is in there.  Plus, I found information about which I was previously unaware.  Joe Friel (renowned cycling coach and author) writes an introduction, and as he said, no other book even compares, at this time, in terms of content.<br /><br />(2) AUTHORITATIVE.  The authors are recognized in cycling circles as two of the most knowledgeable persons in the United States on using a power meter for cycling training.  The authors' combination of an experienced cycling coach and former professional cyclist (Allen) and an exercise physiologist / scientist (Coggan) is not available in any other cycling training book, to my knowledge.<br /><br />(3) EASY TO USE.  The chapters are organized logically and, on my second reading, it has been easy to go back to subjects that interest me more than others.<br /><br />(4) NOT TOO COMPLEX.  The authors touch every subject thoroughly and comprehensively, but do so in a way that is not too difficult to understand or grasp.  Admittedly, I was already very familiar with the basic terminology of training with power prior to my first reading.  Even so, it seems to me that someone with very little prior exposure to training with power would grasp, and benefit from, muchof the content on first reading.<br /><br />Despite my five star rating (which I give without hesitation), I felt that the book had a couple of distractions:<br /><br />(1) The writing style is a bit choppy and sometimes lacks  flow and sophistication.  Occasionally, the style is a bit colloquial or informal.  Then again, cycling coaches and scientists are not usually known for English professor type of writing, so the style was almost expected and happily tolerated.<br /><br />(2) The authors sometimes toot their own horns a bit too much.  Besides writing this book, the authors developed one of the first (and in my view, one of the best) third-party software programs used to analyze power meter computer files.  In the book, at times, the authors did not hesitate to give full accolades for their own software product, while giving not so generous treatment of other products.  The bottom line, however, is that their products probably deserve such high treatment.  But, it was a bit of a distraction.<br /><br />Overall, I felt that this type of book should have been published years ago.  Now that it is here, I expect to refer to it again and again.  It's one of those books that you can read several times and learn something new each time.  But, I never seemed overwhelmed by it.  I highly recommend this book for any serious cyclist.

0380002930|5.0|I was reading this wonderful book again and a friend saw it and asked what it was about.  I didn't answer immediately because that is a difficult question to answer.  Finally I said it was about friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice.  Then...\\"Why is there a rabbit on the cover?\\"  I went on to explain it is about rabbits but that is secondary to the power of the story. <br /> <br />I visit this book every five or six years and I just completed my fifth reading so we go back aways, like an old friend from junior high.  It is my most beloved book from childhood but it is not a children's book.  There is violence and dark imagery so it is more along the lines of the epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"The Hobbit\\" in its grand adventure. <br /> <br />The narrative is fully engrossing as we meet our new friends and take the journey with them.  We learn their language and customs and beliefs and it doesn't take very long before we forget these are rabbits that talk because there is no time for that.  There are dangers at every turn and it is in how they face these dangers that is where the true heart of the book lies. <br /> <br />Sure, their adventures are fantastic yet realistic but it is the little moments between characters that has endeared them to me.  Another Amazon reviewer summarized it best...\\"it speaks to the child in all of us and the simple virtues that we all want the world to embody.\\"  When I first read the book twenty something years ago I wanted to be a little more like Hazel and Bigwig.  Now, twenty something years later, I still do.   <br /> <br />
0307276902|1.0|Is this a good work of fiction?  Not really.  Any resonance with the characters came from their basis in reality.  And let the uninformed who defend Frey take note: this is not embellishment.  Being questioned by police for a couple hours cannot be \\"misremembered\\" as having spent months in jail.  That's called lying.  And enough with the apologies.  Want to do something good? Give half the money you made off your lie to charity.  Loser.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Where to start?  This is a three hour black and white film that was over before I knew it.  Like Robert Altman's \\"Short Cuts\\", I sat enthralled, mesmerized, and involved in the world of the Holocaust.  If Spielberg, Liam Neeson, and Ben Kingsley never do another thing with their lives, they have done something.  It is the best movie of that year, although \\"The Piano\\" was close.  As Roger Ebert wrote - \\"it was an awesome experience\\".  And it was just that, an experience.  You were living with these people on the screen, with the awful events in their lives, and constantly I thought \\"How would I measure up?\\"  How much money do I squander and waste - how much I carp over little things.  Does it take some cataclysmic event to bring out the best (or worst) in us?  Where do you draw the line on \\"life at any cost\\"?  Why is life so dear when all religions teach us the afterlife is better?  There is a grand dichotomy here.  Why was I not born a Jew in Poland?

B000E33VWW|5.0|\\"Capote\\" is a movie that sticks with you days after watching it. The screenplay is as gripping and exciting as a fictional mystery, yet it builds on the true account of how Truman Capote came to write [[ASIN:0375507906 In Cold Blood]] -- a new genre he dubbed the \\"non-fiction novel\\".<br /><br />After reading the New York Times article on the murder of a farming family in Holcomb, Kansas in 1959, Capote travels there with childhood friend Harper Lee, author of [[ASIN:B000O9TN0K To kill a Mocking bird]], on the premise of writing an article for the magazine \\"The New Yorker\\". In the process he befriends Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) who heads the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and a number of townspeople. The killers, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins) and Richard Hickock, are caught and convicted.<br /><br />Capote visits them in prison and helps obtain a lawyer for their appeal, but eventually becomes obsessed with Smith. He sees him as a vulnerable, sensitive and misunderstood man; someone who he can relate to -- alone, troubled and sad. By the time their appeals are rejected and they are headed for the gallows, Capote is overwhelmed with grief, perhaps personal guilt for using them to write his \\"non-fiction novel\\". It is a tragedy one supposes Capote never overcame, considering no major work from him appeared after \\"In Cold Blood\\". Ironically, he, too, in a way became a victim.<br /><br />To visually convey the brutality of the subject matter, a number of images are startlingly realistic, and stay with you long after the movie ends. Among these is Truman Capote opening the wooden casket of the murdered Mrs. Clutter, dressed in blue, her faced wrapped entirely in cotton. So too is the bloody and violent slashing of Mr. Clutter's throat and the shotgun blasts to the heads of the Clutter family. The hanging of Perry Smith, which begins with heavy breathing quickens as he is about to be executed, is an experience the viewer practically lives. And finally, after he is dropped from the trap door, his body jerks momentarily, then  it is still forever -- a scene chillingly reminiscent of the movie [[ASIN:B0000AN4JE In Cold Blood]].<br /><br />Moreover, it is Philip Seymour Hoffman who immerses himself in the persona of Truman Capote. He assumes Capote's appearance and quirky demeanour, complete with raspy voice and mannerisms, with such convincing perfection. It is little wonder he has garnered a host of accolades, including a Golden Globe and Oscar.

B00005JOFO|5.0|EXCELLENT movie. Whether you are for or against or indifferent to homosexuality, your preconceived prejudices won't stand up to this movie. When you get down to it, it's just an emotional, tragic, love story that tugs at the heart on so many levels BEYOND the homsexuality story. There are so many issues being dealt with in this movie that if you try to focus only on the \\"gayness\\" of it, you will miss a great message and the essential point of the entire movie. I cried a lot. Great acting.

B000002UAU|5.0|For those who didn't live through the Beatles-era, what was it about them?  They were simply better than everyone else in \\"rock music\\".  Better songwriting, singing, playing, far better musical production, more variety, mastered more styles, unerring sense of melody.  Most rock music acts can be considered great if they write less than one-tenth as many great melodies/songs as these 5 guys (include George Martin).  George and Ringo would've been big individual stars in any other band.  In the Beatles they happened to be joined by the two greatest rock singers and songwriters so far in the history of this kind of music.  The early Beatles were great, with songs not that different from everybody else, just more great ones.  However, from Rubber Soul forward they left everyone else behind and created a totally new world of sounds.  Still the most groundbreaking and influential -- Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, The White Album, Abbey Road -- interesting to speculate whether anyone in \\"rock music\\" will ever equal this achievement.
0307276902|1.0|I think James Frey needs to take some lessons in how to construct a page. He and some others think he's a brilliant writer with his non-format format. I struggled for a while to read the dense text with no paragraph breaks and no punctuation and finally gave up. It was so unpleasant to read, I simply lost interest. I also didn't buy the part of him getting on that plane in the beginning. No airline would allow anyone in his condition to board a plane. I fly a lot and I've seen people in much better shape than he was denied boarding.  <br /> <br />How do books like this get published? The redemption from drugs and alcohol is admirable, but he could've done a much better job in telling the story. People who need to read this book the most probably wouldn't be able to concentrate on the horror of its presentation. <br />

1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon was a very interesting book because it had interesting characters and a good story line.<br /><br />  This novel by Mark Haddon is about Christopher John Francis Boone; Christopher is very smart and knows every prime number up to 7,057. The setting takes place in present day Swindon, England. The main conflict of the story is that Christopher's neighbor, Mrs. Shear's dog Wellington is killed. Christopher is walking around his street after midnight and finds Wellington lying on the ground with a gardening fork in his stomach. Mrs. Shears is convinced that Christopher has killed Wellington, even though she knows how much of an animal lover Christopher is. Mrs. Shears calls the police on Christopher, the cop accuses Christopher of killing Wellington, so her punches the officer in the face, because of the accusation and the officer touched Christopher, and the one thing he hates the most is to be touched. After sitting in the police station, waiting for his father, Christopher decides he is determined to find out who killed Wellington.<br /><br />  The main characters of the story are Christopher, Christopher's father and Mrs. Shears. Christopher is very intelligent, but he really lacks social skills. He pretty much refuses to talk to anyone he doesn't know. The way he starts to be friends with someone is by watching them closely for a couple of weeks, after that he starts to ask them basic questions like; their name, their age, favorite color, and soon he becomes friends with them. Christopher really relates better to animals, that's why he would never kill Wellington, he loves all animals and has a rat named Toby. Christopher hates to be touched and that combined with the accusation caused him to assault the police officer. Christopher's father is another important character. Mr. Bone is a man with a short temper. He didn't seem to care too much that his son assaulted a police office, but he cares more that Christopher wants to investigate who Wellington was killed by, and Mr. Boone doesn't like nosy people, so it causes him to be irritated with his son. Mrs. Shears is another main character, she was Wellington's master. Christopher really likes Mrs. Shears because after Christopher's mother died of a heart-attack she came and comforted them and took care of them. Mrs. Shears does not like Christopher as much now because of what happened to Wellington. Mrs. Shears is divorced; Christopher suspects that Mr. Shears might have killed Wellington.<br /><br />  On page 42 Christopher decides who his main suspect is; \\"I only knew one person who didn't like Mrs. Shears, and that was Mr. Shears, who knew Wellington very well, indeed. This meant that Mr. Shears was my prime suspect.\\" This was an important passage in the novel because Christopher is starting to get some where with his investigation of who killed Wellington, by piecing together the clues.<br /><br />  I would connect this book to Life of Pi by Yann Martel; the characters Pi Patel and Christopher John Francis Boone are very similar. Both Pi and Christopher are quite kids that keep to themselves. Both the characters like animals better than they like humans and they are both around the age of sixteen. I would recommend this book to anyone who liked Life of Pi or to anyone that likes humorous mysteries.

B00005JOFO|5.0|I have never done a movie review before but I am so angry at the moment, that I have to voice my opinion. I just watched the Academy Awards and I feel like I have just been punched in the face. Brokeback Mountain is the most wonderful film that I have seen in years. Not only is the acting outstanding but the story is very true to life. The film has earned over 70 million dollars at the box office and has earned 8 nominations. For the first time in my life, I just sat through the 78th Academy Awards show. WHAT A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!! This wonderful film lost to Crash? Why? I watched Crash a couple days ago and it was like watching a poor version of All in the Family. But at least with All in the Family you got a laugh. The only thing good about Crash were the closing credits. Unfortunately I had to attempt twice to see the ending of Crash as I kept falling asleep. Tonights award show just proves that this type of show is just another political statement. I don't believe the votes have anything to do with the movie. I think it is just politics and I will never waste 3 hours of my life to watch this type of trash awards show again. If anyone wants to see a \\"real\\" moving movie with great acting please see Brokeback. If you wish to see some political statement rent \\"All in the Family\\". At least you will get a laugh out of it.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|Reese Witherspoon's victory at last night's Oscars nonwithstanding I was appalled at the lack of recognition by the Academy.  I forget who but one of the participants joked that it was \\"Ray\\" with white people.  That's a shame because it diminishes what an impressive work this is.  Though I'm not a fan of country music per se Johnny Cash always garnered my respect and kind of had street cred.  You had to admire Cash's uncompromising devotion to his work and how he carried his pain and personal demons with dignity.  The makers of \\"Walk the Line\\" were cognizant of the integrity of their subject matter and unlike \\"Ray\\" do not try to mimic the artist their portraying.  Instead they try to channel the spirit and essence of Cash and wholeheartedly succeed.  Joaquin Phoenix may not have the physical build or vocal intonations of Cash but he intuitively understood the essence of the man.  It doesn't take much doing to imagine the Man in Black playing out his own life on the screen.  Witherspoon equals Phoenix in her portrayal of the commonsensical June Carter.  Less is known about Carter than Cash but in Witherspoon's portrayal you can imagine how her guardian angel saved Cash from the abyss of substance abuse.  I have no doubt in my mind that time will be kind to \\"Walk the Line\\" and be re-evaluated as the truly great film that it is.

It is always difficult and a risk to share a difficult and eye-opening personal experience; but doing so challenges us all; and it's the folks that dare to do these things that will change the world for the better; this simple willingness to inspect the true root of our beliefs, separate out what we've been taught from what we find truly affecting and related to our own experience.    <br /> <br />Movies like this one (read, movies that speak of real human emotion and the real daily tragedies of human experience; and movies that let us FEEL these emotions, tragedies, and experiences rather than telling us what to feel in words) are rare in this market of stupid comedies and explosions...rare especially in broader 'market cinema'.  But when they do get out there, break out of the 'indie movie' circuit and become more readily accessible, if they can change even one person's life, then my hopes for the world are affirmed.  Many condemn these movies as a knee-jerk, without even knowing wherefrom they speak...they 'KNOW' the movie is 'evil' because they 'KNOW' it...not because they challenged themselves in any way to actually SEE it first.  Indeed, I doubt many of these folks who are so vehemently against the so-called 'gay agenda' went to see \\"Brokeback\\" or \\"Transamerica\\", or they might realize that the only agenda most of us have is to be loved, respected, and treated as human beings.   <br /> <br />Granted, many cities didn't show these movies, meaning that folks who WANTED to see them in some areas would have had to drive or fly to another city to do so--proving once and for all that our 'elected' officials think of us as children to be 'protected' from ourselves rather than simply giving us the choice to watch something or not, but that is a whole other rant.  But it is my belief that no one should have an opinion on something they haven't seen/experienced for themselves, or at least tried to put themselves in those shoes for a moment or two.  Experiences cannot be judged, because no one but the experiencer has any idea what the heck they're talking about; and if anything has actually been experienced by someone, then it is as valid as any other experience.  I cannot judge the validity of the effect that any experience has had on another person's life; I can only judge my own...but it is the fact that, upon discussion, so many people had such a similar experience with this film that makes me feel that we really all have a great deal more in common than we might believe; as much as the experience might have touched us for different reasons...for we are all different.  Thank God.  <br />  <br />Speaking of wonderful variety, I too would have liked to see more variety in the awards. This has been a great year for movies, with many making very important points (which in my world means moviemaking at its best; using the power of the screen to reach out and make people THINK...even if some would prefer to spend their money on trashy, big-budget remakes that don't strain their faculties or comfort zones at all). \\"Munich\\" and \\"Good Night and Good Luck\\" and perhaps \\"Crash\\" certainly deserve more awards.  But all in all it's been a very intelligent movie year; and a year with a whole BUNCH of standouts makes it hard to get a good spread on the awards.  <br /> <br />Still, part of me is also elated. Who would have thought a film like \\"Brokeback\\" would have made it to eight nominations in any show in the US? (Or that \\"Transamerica\\" would win anything in this country?!) The fact that they can even be shownin mainstream theaters in this country--whatever the limitations put on circulation--rather than being restricted to the 'arthouse' circuit as they once would have been shows how far we've come. And when I saw \\"Brokeback\\", three times thus far in the week since it's gotten enough buzz to actually leave the 'safe' cities for the second tier, there were a lot of straight men wearing western attire there with their wives...and people came out thoughtful and moved. And that right there is a testament to how we're FINALLY, if slowly, growing as a society. It's the first thing in a long time that's given me hope that the USA might actually get back to what was once great about it, and maybe even live up to its great potential after all...as a country where, one hopes, someday everyone will be safe and free to live and love without needing to harm anyone else to *feel* safe...instead of just talking about it.   <br /> <br />I have now seen this movie three times, and wish I could see it more; for each time, I have found something different; deeper, more heart-wrenching...and in the end, salving.  I have seldom seen a movie whose cinematography, writing, music, casting, editing, direction, production, setting, and overall feel were so in tune.  \\"Dances With Wolves\\" springs to mind.  Day-Lewis and Stowe's \\"Last of the Mohicans\\".  And yes, oh yes, although this one came at a time when the movie could not be as brave as \\"Brokeback\\" with its adaptation, \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\", beside which \\"Brokeback\\" has its rightful place reserved on my shelf, as the novella stands beside \\"Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe\\" on my shelf of literary masterpieces.  Because in the end it's not about the make-up for the necessary but difficult 'aging', not about why Gyllenhall is called a 'supporter', why Hathaway didn't get recognized as much as Williams...but about the EXPERIENCE...and how it changed every one of us who saw it.  I cannot wait for the deleted scenes sure to be on theDVD (as evidenced by dialogue and scenes not seen in the theatrical release but shown or heard in the trailers), hoping that with more Jack and Ennis, I might get just one more tiny clue more as to WHY...and maybe even...'someday'.   <br /> <br />For this reason, I went to find the novella, and read it in minutes, starving for meaning; driven by the pain...and the reluctant beauty.  For this reason I went back and back again; and as many have said, the first time, the ending shattered me, the few moments of dialogue staggered me (\\"And then you tell me you'll kill me for needin' something I hardly never git!  I wish I knew how to quit you!\\"  \\"Then why don't you?  You're the reason I am the way I am!  I have nothin', I am nothin'...\\"  and the terrible catharsis of \\"You aren't nothing.  I love you,\\" still unspoken...and the image of what has been lost because in that time and place, it simply could not be had.  The second time, the music stepped out as a star, where in the first viewing, it was so much a part of the experience that I didn't hear it so much as *felt* it.  Now every time I hear that music, those few beautifully spare, painful, poignant chords of lonely guitar, I see Ennis holding the shirts, looking at the postcard, and I cry as I haven't cried in or at a movie since I forced myself to stop crying at anything, at age six, for similar reasons to Ennis's, though in a much different situation.  And in the last time, while still shattered, I even managed to find a kind of peace with the finality of the ending; and the faint breath of hope, like air, that breaks into the terrible self-imposed claustrophobia of the final image of Ennis Del Mar; still with his love and pain in the literal closet...but now able to cry, and promise Jack what he could not in life.  \\"I know better now; we would have lost anyway.  But at least we wouldn't have lost the years, too; and what might have been before this end.\\"   <br /> <br />A movie with a message that, like the protestations of love that so many feel are necessary to *portray* love, connection, loss...did not need narration to worm its way into the hearts of everyone watching, gay, straight, or self-challenging; a message and moment and music that haunts long after the movie ends, and demands another viewing just to try to get it right in one's head.  \\"WHY did it have to be this way?\\"  Because it WAS. <br /> <br />Therefore I also cannot wait for for the Oscars tonight to see if true Artistry and pure experience will win out over market value and the battle of the hype about a movie that is not really *about* being gay, and that finally pokes holes in a stereotype (the Western Man, the Cowboy, not the gay man or the ex-gay) that badly needed some air let in to reality.  Monolithic status and unrealistic pedestals do no one any good, as no one who is human can live up to such standards, which have nothing to do with reality and the real human condition.  I feel justified in saying these things having been raised in a place much like 'Signal Wyoming'; Crouch Idaho, home of a rodeo ground and only 600 cowboys, where the only way out was bullriding or logging for Boise Cascade, and the teen pregnancy rate was the highest in the US, and grinding poverty was the norm, and lack of education celebrated as a cultural plaudit.  These things became part of my bones; the bleakness of that life, all the things I was so desperate to escape.  Now it is gone, and in its place are a new generation of people who have never worked so hard for so little in their lives, moved to 'God's Country' to 'go country', and think that putting on the hat and boots and listening to Garth Brooks makes them 'cowboys' who have a right and the authority to comment on the portrayal of a lifestyle they really know nothing about.  No true cowboy or ranch hand that I ever met, be it sheep or cattle or horses, would walk into any building without taking their hats off.   They didn't *talk* about being cowboys, try to prove it.  they simply were.  Them I respect, despite my reservations about the lifestyle.  I do not respect the grand mass of folks who talk about this movie as if they know what they are talking about, for most of them didn't even bother to watch it...and most of them have never met a TRUE cowboy.  If they did, they'd learn something about shooting off at the mouth when you don't know nothin' about the life. <br />  <br />I've gotten a bit far afield here, but I'll come back to the beginning long enough to thank everyone in here once more for their willingness to stick it out there...both to allow the film to work in you in whatever way it was meant to in your personal journey and experience, and for your willingness to share that experience with others so that we all might be enriched in our own experiences.  With discussion comes learning; and IMO, that's what we're here for...to learn from each other and in that way find greater Understanding and Love. <br />I'll close with the following quote: <br /> <br />\\"Some people might be amazed to discover that other people can be spiritually-minded, and yet not use their spiritual vocabulary.\\" <br /> <br />This quote helps me to try to live the tolerance that I request from others.  Since our spiritual vocabulary, as with any of our vocabularies, comes from our worldly experience (of sprituality, the world, life, etc), and each experience is different, therefore the vocabularies we use to describe those experiences to each other *must* in fact be different.  And as language is worldly, it is inherently inaccurate for such experiences...but as it is the only tool we have to share such things, we must use that gift from God and discuss, Discuss, DISCUSS!!! <br /> <br />May love and wonder work within us ALL.

B000BNX3B4|4.0|Seems consensus is that acting is superb, but storyline maybe lacking a five star impact.  This reviewer agrees.<br /><br />Lane and Cusack are very comfortable and attractive in their roles, with good support cast of characters.<br /><br />Storyline at points wants to break out of its groove of two divorcees who struggle with match game from relatives and friends into something really great, but then kind of slips back into its above average performance. Great lines at times, with original comedic endings which are unexpected.<br /><br />Certainly four stars leaning toward the ultimate five.
1558216340|4.0|The questioning that attends this book is no surprise, given its apocryphal status and the fact that it is about something as outrageous as a 1,000 mile unsupported walk lasting one year through Siberia and the Gobi desert, among other places.     First of all, let me acknowledge that we are all speculating here, based either on deductions from available \\"evidence\\" or our preferred visions of human potential. None of us can be absolutely certain that we are right. Having said that, here is the history of my relationship with this book.     I read it twice in short succession. After the first time, I was won over not only by the story itself, but also ravished by the belief that this sort of thing is possible. I saw the book as a testament to the ability of the human spirit (and body) to endure tremendous hardship in the quest for freedom.  I raved about it, and in doing so told a friend about the part where Yeti are encountered. My friend, who lived in the Himalaya mountains for several years, laughed and said: it can't be true, there are no Yeti! That allowed some doubt to enter my mind, which was furthered by learning more about the Gobi desert. The desert described in the book sounds like the Sahara, with endless miles of sand dunes, and not the Gobi. At this point my doubt gave way to a shift in my thinking about the truth of this story. I no longer believed that it actually took place in a literal sense.     As I wrote above, I read it a second time, and still found plenty to like about it, despite no longer thinking it was true. I think it accurately and truthfully describes many human qualities: cooperation, generosity, determination, courage, endurance, cruelty and too many others to list here. So in that sense it is a truthful story, detailing much about the human condition in a sensitive and engaging way. But I do not regard it as a true story. I do not think the author actually did that journey, nor lived through other things detailed in the book, such asthe time spent standing in the prison cell. Does this make the story less worthy? I think not, as a story, but it does strip off its fantastical allure.     The story is good regardless, but I think the presentation of it as true might be a  marketing ploy. In fact I think this book should be sold with a disclaimer: its claim to truth is controversial, to say the least!
B000E1YVZU|3.0|I loved Rent when I saw it on stage, and I could probably play the original cast recording back in my head start to finish without prompting. So I was really looking forward to the movie.  Immagine my disappointment when I actually saw what came out.  A lot of the music had been left out, with musical dialogue turned in to spoken dialogue, seemingly at random.  I bought the DVD because half a Rent is better than no Rent at all, but it could have been so much more.  I had the same reaction to Phantom of the Opera.  As a fan of the play, I think it would have been better if they had simply set a video camera in the third row of the orchestra and taped a performance right off the stage.  All the extra production that went into the movie took away from the play and didn't add anything.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I have spent much of my life traveling, on my own, with friends, on business, etc. I've found myself in Seoul and Tokyo and Beijing and a dozen other Asian cities, alone and for extended periods of time. I've never even contemplated wallowing in my own despair like these two losers did. I cannot imagine how anyone could consider this a charming or productive relationship. The only thing they had in common was mutual misery and the inability to make a decision or rise above their own self-pity. <br /> <br />I guess this movie would appeal to people who have never traveled, or have traveled while never immersing themselves in the experience. Maybe people who have never had a positive experience traveling, or who have never shared a deep relationship during an unknown experience. If they had, they'd know these two were simply losers who found each other. Anyone with an ounce of inquisitive spirit and ability to cope could not possibly sympathize with these two pathetic souls. <br /> <br />Beyond that, the acting was fair, the scene setup and plot nonexistent, and any kudos this film got was for the famous progenitor of the mediocre wannabe director.
0792833260|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this excellent movie 5 stars is because I do have other favorite movies that I find better than Rain Man and they got my 5 star reviews. But that does not take away anything from this great movie. Dustin Hoffman delivers an exceptionally wonderful performance as Raymond Babbitt, the autistic savant and Tom Cruise delivers a good performance as his younger brother Charlie. It's no surprise that Rain Man won Academy Awards for it is a very touching story. Great from beginning to end. Brilliantly written. Rain Man will always remain one of the best movies of all times.

0763619612|5.0|Peter H. Reynolds has crafted a simple but inspiring story that recognizes the creativity in everyone and shows how simple words can inspire that creativity. This is a book for all those people who have been told they can't by someone, because it proves that imagination lies within us all and that we only need hear it from someone so that we may begin to believe it ourselves. Reynolds reminds us of the powerful influence of teachers and their ability to challenge the preconceived notions we might hold about ourselves, encouraging us to dream and turn those dreams into reality.

B00005JOFO|5.0|It is disheartening to see homophobic people in the media, and here, mocking or denouncing \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", but quite typical.  It's a common symptom of the sexual insecurity which a lot of Americans wear so proudly, further evidenced in the fraud of male genital mutilation, euphemistically known as \\"circumcision\\".<br /><br />It takes a lot of consideration for me to pay for a film at the cinema, and I can usually tell if a film is going to be any good, or at least something to which I can relate or enjoy.  I usually don't care for country/western genre films.  However, given that, the simplicity and honesty of this film simply astounded and forced me to see past the country element.  The story is poignant (look for the brilliant symbolism).  The ending is classic.  Anyone who has truly fallen in love from a distance can relate to this story.  The distant and rural scenes of this film illuminates the sense of loneliness and longing within the characters.  It's not often to find a soul mate and sad when one is forced to live a double life to express love for that person, especially from a distance.  If Jack and Ennis hadn't been in love, they wouldn't have bothered, given the inconvenient and unruly nature of their culture, or lack thereof.  Their relationship isn't only about sexual expression, it's about the journey they take as a result of their love for one another.<br /><br />\\"Crash\\" technically was chosen, and maybe it's a good film, but I hadn't even heard of it until a week ago.  England's more free and open society is why \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" received the BAFTA, and rightly so.  It's a higher honour than the Oscar.  I'm buying the DVD.
0689877692|5.0|This is a dazzling pop-up book, truly spectacular in its design! Having presented this book at the Children's Museum of Denver on multiple occasions, I believe my audiences were amazed with its construction and it never failed to delight the children and their parents. It is somewhat fragile, though, the pull tab for \\"Five wiggle wobble widgets...\\" being among the most delicate constructions. The concise text is punctuated by the title phrase throughout the book making it an inviting read-aloud, especially for early readers, who will undoubtedly begin to anticipate the phrase and say it along with you. The oohs and ahs that this book elicits when I read it consistently brings a smile to my face. David A. Carter has crafted a book so elegantly simple yet so incredibly creative that it must be held and touched to be fully enjoyed. The wonder of finding the red dot will charm children everywhere.

B00005JNRE|5.0|Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) supports his adorable but difficult brood off a monthly allowance provided by his beloved late wife's great aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury). Alas, the ultra-proper lady, a straight-backed, coiffured and hatted old bitty, demands that he discipline his seven devils, who aim chiefly to dispatch nannies as soon as they arrive. The little dears keep a running total, via a colored chalk graph upon their blackboard, of how quickly they have dispensed with the last 17 to grace their nursery. The most recent came and went within days.<br /><br />Cook loathes the children, and constantly waves her contract, which prohibits them from entering her kitchen. Only the gorgeous scullery maid, Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald), has a spec of kindness for either the kids or their hapless dad.<br /><br />Not only cannot poor Mr. Brown support his children on his wages from the mortuary, where he works alongside the sympathetic but vaudevillian Mr. Jowl and Mr. Wheen (Derek Jacobi). He now has more problems to boot. Aunt Adelaide commands him to find a new nanny at once--and worse, to marry within the month, or loose his allowance. Finally, she insists on relieving his burdens by taking one of his children in as her own adopted child.<br /><br />Mr. Brown turns to the Nanny Placement Center, but it has shut its doors, proclaiming there are \\"no more nannies.\\" Through the mailbox, a voice echoes, \\"You need Nanny McPhee.\\" He heads home in despair. His newspaper, cut into paper dolls, sports an add for Nanny McPhee. Then the toothy, fat, warted, large-bosomed, big-nosed woman (an amazingly-ugly-and-well-made-up Emma Thompson) appears in silhouette at his Victorian glass door and quickly promises to teach Mr. Brown's children five sacrosanct lessons.<br /><br />The first one is to say please and thank you: The kids set off to the kitchen to their latest antics, but Nanny McPhee outwits them with a tap of her crooked walking stick. Their mischief grows ever-more fast and furious, so they cannot stop, even when the baby is about to be hurled into a boiling pot. Thus, they all beg Nanny McPhee to \\"please\\" stop the culinary chaos. Another tap of the cane brings order and neatness all around.<br /><br />The greater problem is how to deal with Aunt Adelaide's command that Mr. Brown marry. Heavy-hearted, he settles on a garish and obscene widow, Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie), despite warnings from his mortuary friends and the most mischievous efforts of his children. The subtle gentleness with which Nanny McPhee helps the Browns to cope with their problems is what makes this magic movie such a delight.<br /><br />Nanny McPhee is far more enterprising than Mary Poppins ever was and the movie is much more dramatic and entertaining than the \\"classic\\" musical Disney fare.

006056251X|5.0|Against the volatile backdrop of a somewhat jaded London gambling club, Lisa Kleypas has created a vibrant, compelling and very satisfying love story in this third installment in the \\"Wallflower\\" series.  Shy, stuttering and insecure Evie Jenner is desperate to marry in order to escape her life of virtual imprisonment with her late mother's abusive relatives.  She is frantic to be with her dying father Ivo, the wealthy owner of a popular London gambling club, who is near death from consumption.  Her hateful relatives will not permit her to visit Ivo, whom they view as beneath them.  They are now trying to force Evie to marry her grotesque cousin, so that they may gain control over the fortune she will inherit when Ivo dies.  Evie manages to sneak away, and goes to the home of the dazzling but dissolute Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent.  Evie knows that the womanizing Sebastian has run out of money, and for mercenary reasons may be willing to marry her, although he would never have looked at her under other circumstances.  What Evie does not realize is that Sebastian is taking a very good look at her now, and he definitely likes what he sees - intelligence, toughness, and acute desirability.    Evie finds the courage to propose, Sebastian indeed accepts, and before long they are wed in a quick ceremony in Scotland.  However, Evie insists that once the marriage is consummated, they no longer share a bed.  She believes that Sebastian is incapable of fidelity, and she does not want to get hurt.  Although Sebastian agrees, he does not mean it.  He is determined to prove himself and to win her over.  Evie does not realize how much she has underestimated her new husband, and not just in his loyalty to their marriage.  As they return to London and the precarious state of affairs at her father's club, Sebastian is faced with an onslaught of demands, challenges and crucial business decisions.  He surprises Evie - and himself - at every turn, as the formerly indolent and selfish Sebastian is at last given the chance to prove his worth.     What a wonderful read!  Sebastian is a deliciously splendid hero - intense and passionate with a delightfully dry wit.  And underneath his arrogant and uncaring exterior, he of course has an innate decency and kindness that is lovingly revealed as the story unfolds.  Evie is equally appealing, as this shyest of all the wallflowers finally comes into her own, with a growing confidence and quiet strength that fascinate her increasingly smitten husband.  There is an undeniable attraction between this couple from their very first moments together, two lost souls perhaps sensing a kindred spirit.  The wedding scene is wonderfully written, with both parties clearly wanting more than a sterile marriage, but afraid to admit it even to themselves.  The role played throughout the story by Evie's gold wedding band is pure genius, and creates some of the book's most memorable and tender moments.  Kudos to the sterling supporting cast, including the inimitable Lord Westcliff from \\"It Happened One Autumn,\\" and the enigmatic half-gypsy Cam Rohan, who will hopefully someday get his own Kleypas story.  This book is smartly written and very satisfying and I highly recommend it.
0316777722|4.0|Like many people, I became aware of David Sedaris through listening to the SantaLand Diaries on public radio. You don't get many elf perspectives these days -- or any days really. But, if you did, this would be the best of them. You'll laugh your pointy elf shoes off. <br /> <br />Me Talk Pretty takes a broader autobiographical approach, from his battle with those who would silence his sibilance to misguided midgets teaching guitar. He offers up a self-deprecating style that leads you into one absurd encounter after another. All of them told with very funny and witty writing. Sometimes this kind of thing can be a bit self absorbed to the point where you get tired of it or it simply loses its edge but this manages to maintain. If you want funny, this is it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

Utterly unpretentious.  <br /> <br />This is in no way a book about suicide, the way some people who haven't read it seem to think, though it does chronicle an episode of what must have been the same vulnerability that later resulted in her untimely death. <br /> <br />If you like powerful poetry, get Ariel, which contains the poems Plath was writing when she died. I can only read one or two a day,  then I have to stop and think about them.
B000BJS4TO|4.0|Sadly, it is quite clear that this time around a dual nomination for best original score by the Academy of Arts and Sciences cost John Williams dearly.  The simple fact is that nominations for \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" and \\"Munich\\" in all probability canceled each other out in the voting opening the door for the rather one dimensional and mundane score by Gustavo Santaolalla for \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\"  This becomes even sadder when one considers the overall achievement of Williams this year:  \\"Star Wars Episode III:  Revenge of the Sith,\\" \\"War of the Worlds,\\" \\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\\" and \\"Munich,\\" any one of which was more deserving than the Academy Award winner.  This writer favored \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" which as the sixth sequel to William's original Academy winner \\"Star Wars\\" was one of the best of the that series, and one of the best scores of this year.  All of that said we turn to Williams' fine score for \\"Memoirs of a Geisha.\\"  Williams wrote a complex, touching and evocative score for this film that in many ways was one of the main strengths of the film itself.  As the story past from year to year, it was Williams' music that tied it all together, especially \\"Sayuri's Theme.\\"  Williams and the film director could easily have relied on source music, but instead chose to bring an original treatment to the music for this very beautiful film.  A brilliant production by Sony with performances by Itzhak Perlman and Yo Yo Ma, also a nice presentation.  This is not the first time Williams' music has been the subject of controversy with the Academy, but one hopes it is the last.
0393327655|4.0|THere are more detailed books which examine the same subject but this is one that the average reader can actually read, understand and use as a starting point for further research and conversation. For that reason alone, I think the book is well worth reading.<br /><br />  While it may seem obvious that religion can do harm as well as good, Mr. Harris has a knack of showing how and why we can wear \\"blinders\\" and become biased about how OUR OWN personal religious beliefs can do harm to others. We all have our biases and our blind spots and he provides insight about this.<br /><br />  I particularly like the section of the book which shows how religion can be a substitute for other addictions and when used in this way can be particularly dangerous.<br /><br />  This does not mean, of course, that religion is always a bad thing. Spirituality and religious beliefs can be very, very helpful to many people. But like any other thing which has potential for good, lack of moderation can lead to harm. There is a fine line between helping and being judgmental, being compassionate and being sanctimonious.<br /><br />  I hope this book does not get used as a way of trying to rid society of all reglious and spiritual beliefs. I hope it does get those who think there is only \\"one right way\\" to believe to stop and reconsider their viewpoint.
0385474547|3.0|Things Fall Apart was an okay book. It had an interesting point, though most certainly a biased one and it presented its underlying theme well. The writing style was a little bit simplistic at times, but that was okay. On the other hand though, the book was clearly hard for me to connect with at times, seeing as it's about the \\"Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger\\" as told not from the colonist's point of view, but from those that are being colonized. <br />The book moved quickly. This was especially nice for me as I came to the sudden realization the day before the book was due that I'd accidentally been reading Things They Carried, my bad. So I was able to sit and read the bulk of it in three hours. This was made possible by its simplicity, both in its not so hidden meaning, easy to understand description, and sentence structure. A simple sentence structure can either speed the book up, as it did in this case, or it can slow the book way down much like it did with Hemmingway in almost all of his works. I think the disparity that exists between the two here relies solely upon underlying complexity. With Achebe in Things Fall Apart, the book can be read once, can be looked back upon, and then understood. No ifs ands or buts about it. On the other hand with Hemmingway, there are many layers within the writing requiring a slow and careful reading and re-reading style. Given the choice between the two, I'd go with Achebe. <br />The content of the book was clearly something that the author could relate too although I have my doubts that this is an unbiased source. In future journals I'll discuss specifics of this but for now I'm going to leave the statement as is. His point comes across, and while I certainly don't think that his novel should have spent equal time examining the colonization from the white man's point of view, in not doing so he does show a bias. <br />Despite the bias, which I didn't necessarily find bad, I found Things Fall Apart tobe an enjoyable quick read that actually had a point to it, a rarity in this day and age.
0060595183|5.0|The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell were two separate publications originally.  Doors of Perception was a first person account of Huxley's mescalin trip with a scientist who wanted to record the effects.  Because the session was recorded, he was able to review the tapes and put together a very coherent account of a non-rational event.<br /><br />In both essays, Huxley argues for the use of hallucinogens for expanding consciousness in ordinary people and not reserving the experience of the \\"Mind-at-Large\\" (Doors of Perception) or \\"Other World\\" (Heaven and Hell).  He warns in Heaven and Hell that unfortunately we haven't discovered a drug that can produce a positive experience in every person, that is eliminate the bad trip.  In Heaven and Hell, he denigrates the use of non-pharmacological approaches to reaching the same psychic state, because he assumes that all methods use some sort of self-mortification, and that the mechanism for their efficacy is shock, starvation, or hypoxia.  I am not sure that there is any scientific evidence to support such a claim.  It appears to be speculation unsubstantiated with any evidence.
B00005JOM9|5.0|A movie cannot by itself destroy a stereotype, but maybe America can learn something from this movie.  Picture yourself in Bree's position.  Do you feel extremely uneasy or maybe you can't even go there, even for a second?  Now imagine living that uneasiness day after day, year after year.  That torment is what trans people go through until they transition.  What you see on Jerry Springer is not representative of trans people.  98% of trans people are normal people struggling with an extraordinary problem.  They desire to transition to be mentally and physically whole, something you all take for granted.  Bree's character is much closer to the reality of what a trans person is like in the midst of transition.  Most of us transition and disappear as we assimulate back into society, only now in the role that feels right for us.
0887306101|5.0|In his original series of interviews with successful traders, Jack Schwager gives us an insight into how they achieved their success.  Their answers are as diverse as the number of different trading methods and personalities, but this book is filled with interesting points-of-view, ideas, and essential information that is not found elsewhere.<br /><br />I recommend reading this multiple times and making notes until you have extracted all the information that may be relevant to your particular circumstances.
B000002UB3|5.0|It was June of 1969 that when Paul made a phone call to George Martin stating that the Beatles wanted to do One more album and have him produce it !!!

(3) Maxwell Silver Hammer - A Song thats included in the Let It be Film with Roadie Mal Evans plays the Anvil!!!  (4) Oh Darling - Also included in the Let It Be Film where Paul sings a snippit of it !!!!!

Abbey Road is a Masterpiece the Beatles didn't let us down with their last Album in Fact George Martin was  also  glad that they Recorded their last but best Album !!!!
0812975219|5.0|In this original, entertaining, and very informative book, Taleb takes an in-depth look at randomness, and how it affects every aspect of our lives.  Taleb takes a non-technical and relatively easy-to-understand look at cause and effect, and how many seemingly non-random patterns in the financial markets (and life in general) can be attributed to pure chance.<br /><br />If you have ever been tempted to develop an automated trading system, or optimize one in any way, you should carefully study this book to help avoid all of the nasty pitfalls that traders can fall into if they are not aware of the effects of randomness.
B00008DDRX|5.0|LE MANS is a passionate yet esoteric film about the 24 hours of Le Mans.  Racing and the exhilaration of speed are Steve McQueen's passions and these come through in his inimitable screen presence. However, without a genuine story scripted out, the film remains static for some viewers. Yet, visually it has a quixotic and very dynamic approach to its documentary style of filming and subject matter, which is the allure and fascination for the majority of viewers. McQueen's only motivation for anything he does in this film is summed up by his comments that in effect racing is life and everything in between is just waiting.
B000E33VWW|2.0|Despite the Oscar Nomination and the rave reviews about how close Capote got to the murderer perry smith, i never felt it. There was great distance between the two characters and the affection  which according to product reviews was mutual was simply not there for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This film did not get the oscar and certainly did not deserve to.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I am extremely angry that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" lost at the Academy Awards to that shallow stupid film \\"Crash.\\"  Ang Lee's powerful masterpiece should have gotten the award because it is uncompromising, revolutionary, and wholly original.  At least Ang Lee got Best Director so it's not a total loss.  But shame on the Academy for wimping out.  Shame on them!
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|This movie was absolutely wonderful! Keira Knightley does a wonderful job taking on the part of Elizabeth Bennet! <br /> <br /> At first it seems to the eye that Mr. Darcy is an awful soul full of bitterness and irritablness. But as you slowly proceed through the movie you learn more about him. And you realize that he's not so bad after all. Lizzie despised Mr. Darcy for his proud and arrogant nature. She thought he was the last soul on Earth that she could ever marry. Her fiery attitude towards Mr. Darcy causes friction among the two. And soon, they are both ashamed of who they were. And grow to become affectionate of one another. <br /> <br />He was proud. She was prejudice. This movie is a great view!
B000005RFQ|1.0|This CD gets one star just for the album cover alone.  But the music is even worse.  Isn't this the same band that Ozzy Osbourne was in?  Yes, it is.  Anyway it's bad so stay away.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain has to be one of the best made and thoughtout films of its time. For this decade, i believe this film should on that list for best film made. it was timeless & classic. the movie did something movies lack these days and that is to make a statement that has direct correlation with present day times. brokeback mountain is an eye opener film to show the public that love is love and that the homophobic sentiments we flame our society ruins love. jake & heath did a great job acting wise and making every secene realistic. i do believe that they should had won best picture and also nominating \\"a love that will never grow old\\" for best song should have also been instead of giving the award to a rap duo. the only problem i had with the movie is their choice for ennis' wife. i do believe that the role could have been played by someone else rather than michelle williams. it is understandable since there are some sexual scenes between heath & michelle and they after all married. anne hathaway's character was sort of trivial. the film really was all about jake & ennis and i can not wait for this to pop out on dvd. i will be buying this dvd the first hour it is released and probboly pre ordered. <br /> <br />brokeback mountain.... you deserve best picture from every award show this year... whether it is the oscars or the sags or even mtv movie awards! you deserve it all!
B000BTJDG2|4.0|EMILY ROSE is the purportedly true story of an exorcism that failed, but with surprising consequences.  The film re-tells the story in a series of flashbacks as the priest involved stands trial for negligent homicide.<br /><br />EMILY ROSE is a good film, albeit not a great one.  It is scary, but could be scarier; the courtroom is dramatic but could have been more so.  It is well-acted (especially by Tom Wilkinson as the priest).  It also raises the important issue of science versus faith-- the empirical rationalists will all side with the prosecutor, while those who belive in the preternatural will sympathize with the defense.<br /><br />If the film has a failing, it is that it IS a true story.  By being faithful to this, the screen writers and director missed many chances to improve the drama, enhance the plot, etc.  So, if you are going to watch this, you will have to respect the integrity of the crew and not expect 'Exorcist' style pea soup scenes, levitating beds, and priests with dark, tormented secrets of their own.<br /><br />So, if you'd like an interesting film about evil and the intersection of faith and law, this may be for you.  If you want a scare-the-bejezis-outta-you thriller, this might not be at the top of the list, though it is creepy, in a more thought-provoking way than some maniac with a chainsaw hiding in your barn!

B00005JOHC|1.0|The one star is not for the series, 'cause it's tops. The one star is for the way the company treats its customers. I'm not crawling on my hands and knees begging them to take my money. As long as we keep crawling they can treat us like that. I have a suggestion where they can stick their stuff...
B00006L7XQ|4.0|I first heard his cover of Nine Inch Nails \\"Hurt\\"... and thought it was an amazing cover!!! NIN's Trent Reznor singing \\"Hurt\\" is a darks ong to begin with... but the man of darkness, Cash, there's just something about Johnny Cash that made that song all the more darker when he sings it... I read an interview w/ Trent Reznor (NIN) and Reznor said, \\"I have not listened to my version since Johnny Cash's version.\\" (i can't remember his exact words, but it was very much along the lines of what i quoted above.)<br /><br />I bought the cd just for \\"Hurt\\", but I ended up liking the title track, \\"The Man Comes Around\\", and \\"I Hung My Head\\"... I liked his cover of \\"In My Life\\"... the guitars on that is great...<br /><br />\\"Desperado\\" cover is also great... and I got to hear for the first time, the song called \\"Sam Hall\\" which i originally heard Clint Eastwood sing in the movie \\"Two Mules For Sister Sara\\", so it was nice to hear Cash singing it put to music...<br /><br />When the cd came out, i also heard \\"Personal Jesus\\" originally by Depeche Mode... his cover on this is okay... i felt it could be better, guitar wise... out of the 2, i have to say i like Depeche Mode's version better, mainly becuase of how their guitars sound, and the vocals too.. I could tolerate Cash's vocals on it if the guitars matched DM's, but they don't... Cash's version on this song is just a lil slow for me...<br /><br />which is why i gave it 4 1/2 stars.... but it is a great cd... and whether or not your a long time Cash fan then check out this cd... Cash fan's might not like this one, but if you're up for something diff... then check it out... I've never really been into Johnny Cash, but when this cd came out, i got it, solely for \\"Hurt\\"... I to, haven't listened to NIN's version since Cash's..
0385504209|3.0|It's a fun book. An airport or a beach type of book. It zings along with plenty of pace and a few nifty turns up shady alleys and dead ends. You should get a copy when you go on holiday... you will enjoy it.<br /><br />HOWEVER- Dan Brown is no wordsmith- in fact he is a poor writer- a man who is not blessed with a decent understanding of grammar, syntax, language rules, nor does he possess a wide and powerful armoury of literary description nor  does it seem like he can develop a character - he is clich&eacute;d and pass&eacute;. It has to be said though, that he does tell a ripping yarn ....<br /><br />BUT- it is fun- just don't get carried away on the publicity tide and simply enjoy your holiday.<br /><br />Can you imagine if Dan Brown, all plot, no writing prowess and Ian McKewan, an exquisite writer, who can't tell a story for the life of him, teamed up... not that would be worth the hype. (Unless of course the two negative bits were the ones that got together)
B00004RJ71|4.0|A really good movie... if you're still unsure about this movie, search \\"American Me\\" and read my review there, i wrote some stuff on this movie there too.<br /><br />I really love this movie alot... I seen it about 30+ times... It's def. one to own.. If you seen \\"American Me\\", or are into the gangsta films, then see this one...<br /><br />This one focuses on the culture (La Raza), and life in/outside of prison... it follows the path of 3 brothers, 1 as an artist (Cruz), 1 as a cop (Paco), 1 as the prisoner (Miklo). La Raza means a different meaning to Paco and Miklo... Miklo has the wrong meaning... but i'm not going to tell you what it means, cuase then i'd be giving away the movie...<br /><br />Miklo's character is one of the \\"downest\\" (beaing gangsta) characters i seen in some movies... he's no Snoop Dogg, or Dre, but he's character (not to get into any racial offense here) that looks like a Caucasian on the outside, but like he says in the movie, \\"I'm brown on the inside; to the bone.\\" You can only imagine some of the crap he has to go thru cuase of his mix race... which is similar to William Forsythe's character in \\"American Me\\".<br /><br />You see alot of culture in this movie... to me, it's kinda sad of how the movie ends... i wish the makers would make a sequel to it.. i think with how it ends, you could make a sequel to it...<br /><br />oh yeah, i'm not going to translate my title up there for you... You'll find out when you watch the movie what it means..<br /><br />If you're looking for a Bloods & Crips movie, this ain't it, nor is \\"American Me\\"... Both movies involve Latino/Chicano gangs/African American gangs such as: BGF (Black Guerilla Family), Vatos Locos, (Pachucos), AbN (Aryan Brotherhood Nation - these are your nazi skinhead prison gangs)...<br /><br />Don't let the cover pic of \\"Blood In, Blood Out\\" fool you... the red and the blue rag there, cuase there ain't no Bloods & Crips in this one...
B000AL730Y|2.0|I'm a big McCartney fan. But \\"Chaos & Creation\\" just lies there. Sounds like McCartney trying to do a low-key Barry Manilow and keep it bland. \\"Friends to Go,\\" \\"Fine Line\\" and \\"At The Mercy\\" have some unrealized potential, but this is a forgettable monolith of too smooth, too simple, not-so-slick, sound-alike arrangements with melodies don't stick in head or heart. <br /> <br />Lo and behold, an under-produced McCartney album with a producer other than McCartney himself. <br /> <br />Lyrics vacillate in quality from \\"brave old world\\" (a nice turn) to \\"only love can take it on the chin\\" (the second silly boxing metaphor on a punchless album from a vegetarian). <br /> <br />But having made it through \\"C&C\\" seven times without skipping  tracks other than \\"Jenny Wren\\" (yecch!)  and a couple of others,  I gave it two stars rather than just one, because the screech factor is minimal. <br /> <br />It's far from the worst McCartney album. No \\"Temporary Secretary\\" chases \\"Waterfalls.\\" And it's better than the last couple of McCartney misfires, too. <br /> <br />But it's contrived and contrite, too, with melodies worthy of a bad sound track. <br /> <br />Those who compared this to the Beatles need to listen to the Beatles again. <br /> <br />
068987474X|3.0|Overall, I thought this was a good book.  I'm an author of a book in the same general category (dating/relationships) entitled \\"Mode One: Let The Women Know What You're REALLY Thinking,\\" so I tend to read books that deal with this genre.<br /><br />Biggest point I *DISAGREE* with:  The author says, or implies, that when any man chooses not to approach a woman, it's simply because he's \\"not interested.\\"  NOT TRUE.<br /><br />There are [single] men out here who are DREADFULLY AFRAID of approaching women.  They fear rejection and/or criticism.  So, I couldn't agree with that point.<br /><br />#2 minor criticism: The author makes too many [negative] generalizations about men, and their moral and ethical character.  There are GOOD MEN, and there are MANIPULATIVE & DECEITFUL men.  But guess what?  There are GOOD WOMEN, but there are also MANIPULATIVE & DECEITFUL women.  I felt this book was way too harsh on the \\"bad\\" men in society than it was on the \\"bad\\" women in society.<br /><br />Other than that, it was a pretty good book.
B00003CXDV|5.0|SIMPLY STATED: The best and biggest lampooning of STAR TREK that is possible in our world! <br /> <br />FIRST I MUST SAY: that I have seen virtually all of the Star Trek episodes and movies too many times. In fact, I had my own homemade federation uniform that I wore in the 1960s, especially when the \\"Original Series\\" was first running. Still, I appreciate \\"Galaxy Quest\\" and its mission, to put STAR TREK conventionalities upside-down. Wow!  <br />  <br /> <br />HOW IT GETS STARTED: The film opens in a \\"Galaxy Quest\\" convention now some 18 years after the show originally aired. The crew of \\"The Protector\\" are waiting impatiently and acting neurotically as they await their commander's entrance so they can all make their big entrance at the convention and get this gig over with. The comradeship which seems real on the surface is immediately seen as long-gone among the crew. These actors don't like each other and, most of all, they don't respect, but do detest their \\"scene-stealing hack\\" of a Captain, played like the perfectly imperfect backstage James T. Kirk by Tim Allen.  <br /> <br />BUT THEN SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENS: Captain Taggert is happily going through the motions and just soaking up all the hero worship and attention he's getting at the convention by his legions of trekkie-like uniformed fans while his crew just watches with envy from the sidelines. But then as he is making his way into the crowded men's room, Nesmith overhears a group of fans making very nasty comments about what a has-been he [Jason Nesmith] has become and how everyone can see that \\"even his friends can't stand him\\". It sounds kind of cliche, but the setting and Tim Allen make it really work and I feel very sorry for him. Jason Nesmith the actor suddenly realizes that his life \\"obviously\\" is meaningless and he wants to change this. With this EPIPHANY of sorts, the movie takes on a completely different and unexpected direction at light speed [literally].  <br /> <br />That direction is comedy. We have good naive aliens that look weird. We have bad \\"street-smart\\" aliens that look and act bad and we have sweet gently-cute little aliens that want to eat each other and Nesmith too. We even have some wonderful lampooning of the Star Trek Original Series episode \\"ARENA\\" where Nesmith fights monsters against impossible odds and does his customary rolling on the ground antics which never made any sense to me when I saw Kirk doing it almost 40 years ago.  <br /> <br />But there is more. We even have fans on Earth helping Nesmith get through some of his shipboard ordeals after he explains simply that everything about the show and ship are \\"all real\\". Then we have humor almost beyond belief as the logic is based on Trek logic and not what we take for granted as logic.  <br /> <br />To make a very long story short, Nesmith's goal, to discover real meaning in his life is achieved, but the meaning is something that he earns along with new admiration from shipmates, fans, and aliens alike. All of this is completely integrated with the fans the aliens the starship \\"Protector\\" and the TV show enmeshed throughout the film.  <br /> <br />To call this film thoughtfully made would be an understatment. The ending is very well done and replete with humor, drama and some twists and surprises. When it was all done I truly wished they would make a TV series called \\"Galaxy Quest\\" and include \\"this fine ship and this fine crew\\".  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE CAST:  <br /> <br />Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith who is Captain Peter Quincy Taggert [Capt. Kirk like] on TV's \\"Galaxy Quest\\" fictitious program  <br /> <br />Sigourney Weaver is Gwen DeMarco -\\"Lt. Tawny Madison - Repeats Computer\\"  <br /> <br />---*- Alan Rickman - Alexander Dane - \\"Dr. Lazarus - Advisor\\"  <br />---*- Tony Shalhoub - Fred Kwan - \\"Tech Sgt. Chin - Engineer\\"  <br />---*- Sam Rockwell - Guy Fleegman - \\"Crewman Guy - Expendable\\"  <br />---*- Daryl Mitchell - Tommy Webber - \\"Loredo - Helmsman\\"  <br />---*- Enrico Colantoni - Mathesar - \\"Good Alien Leader\\"  <br /> <br />WHAT ABOUT THE DVD: EXCELLENT WIDESCREEN TRANSFER - TOO FEW FEATURES! <br /> <br />This is perhaps the one glaring shortcoming of this film. It has very few features. It has a few deleted scene segments, a short featurette and some short abridged filmographies. It was in Widescreen and the transfer was flawless. Dreamworks could do much better for features as this type of film attracts the kind of fans that really appreciate \\"Special Features\\". <br /> <br />FINAL THOUGHTS: Not just a space-opera comedy, but a fine comedy, and a fine film which is very satisfying to see more than once. I have seen this film at least 30 times since its release, and I do prefer the Widescreen format, but I wish the DVD had more features. <br />
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|This is a fun, if not stellar, coming-of-age movie that will appeal to the whole family.  The premise is clever; the kids of super heroes go to a special high school where they learn to use their powers while dealing with the social stress and awkwardness of adolescence.  Themes such as the \\"first girl friend,\\" \\"hanging with the cool crowd,\\" and \\"pleasing dad\\" are intelligently handled.  It is also neat to see this sort of movie focus on a male character, and the problems he encounters. <br /> <br />The violence here is so comic bookish that it helps keep the laughs and the characters moving.  One doesn't have to worry about the characters dieing, except from embarrassment.  In some ways, that is the worst sort of death to experience, a point that the movie makes. <br /> <br />Kurt Russell does an exceptional job playing the slightly oblivious father.  Kelley Preston is the absolutely drop-dead gorgeous mother.  The rest of the cast and characters are fun, although perhaps a bit stereotypical.  This was especially true for Layla (played by Danielle Panabaker), the alternate love interest who is a plant-loving vegan who won't fight unless directly assaulted. She quickly became a caricature of the \\"liberal hippy child\\" instead of a compelling character.  The plot is also predictable, but give the whole movie, this works OK. <br /> <br />Over all, I recommend this movie for benign laughs and a good time.   <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you saw Serenity without seeing Firefly (the TV show) first, go back and do your homework.  It's a story that really can't be told well in 2 hours...it requires more time. <br />  Serenity was made for the people who saw Firefly, a really fantastic television show, apparently not made for today's audience...not made for the folks who prefer \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" or watching people eat bugs.  It is an intelligent, fresh approach to space science fiction, a genre that was full of stereotypes, faulty physics and improbable aliens.  Whedon's vision of the future feels true and relevant. <br />  So bravo, Joss Whedon, for some really great work!  We hope you can continue your story someday.

B0006L0LOS|3.0|This review should be 2.5 stars, but I had to choose between 2 or 3 so... I read lots of reviews before posting this one, and still have things to add (although the review by Jane Rhynn \\"Jane the Dervish\\" offers pretty interesting insights). OVERVIEW: A woman acquires cat-like powers and finds herself fighting evil while also tempted to do some naughty things. This is no worse than most of the comic book movies from Batman to Spiderman, and most people who like super-hero movies will probably have fun watching this once, especially on DVD where you can do laundry or polish your shoes during the sillier parts. HIGHLIGHTS: I was pleased to see a sensual black woman -- the first since TV Batman's Eartha Kitt! -- play Catwoman. Yes, Michelle Pfeiffer was good as the Batman movie's tortured Catwoman, but Halle Berry's Catwoman is just as beautiful and more acrobatic and, well, even campier. The story starts with a promising mystical feel and tense story about an evil cosmetics company. Sharon Stone plays the aging company beauty just fine, another Faye Dunaway in the making. Benjamin Bratt is suitable in the modest role of cop/love interest. The cinematic and musical production values are pretty good, what you'd expect of a popcorn action film. LOWLIGHTS: Halle is a good actress but the script, direction and editing defeat her. Once Halle turns into catwoman, the movie changes into an overextended music video with frenetic cuts and exaggerated closeups. Fine for a 3-minute video, this filming style interferes with the story telling in a real movie. It's also distracting to have the star overdo the butt swaying and to have slinky cat movements sped up into jerky action hero moves. The movie harshly shifts tone and point of view, and in trying to cater to both men and women, actually fails both. For example, the shots of Halle's rear as she bounces a basketball with Benjamin are clearly inserted just to titillate the male factor. Such scenes embarrass many women who roll their eyes and wait for the story to move on. BOTTOM LINE: Worth the price of a rental.
B00005JOFO|3.0|I just went to see the movie over the weekend and had heard all the hype about how wonderful it was.  I'll have to say that it did not live up to the hype.  The acting was great...very well done...but the story itself was EXTREMELY slow.  I found myself extremely bored at times and I don't know of a bigger no-no for a film than to bore the film goer.  Frankly I don't know that this film would have received this amount of attention or hype if it wasn't for the controversial subject matter.  If this were a heterosexual love story it would be another Notebook...average movie but not worthy of best picture.  Of course these are just my opinions and you're welcome to disagree with me.
B0000062GE|5.0|This album is damn near perfect, and as I type that I might as well take out the 'damn near' part and leave it as just plain perfect, because quite frankly, it is!  From start to finish this album is what you want to hear.  From the creepy into in the effect of \\"DARKEST DAYS\\" to the moving and ultimatly depressing \\"WAKING UP BESIDE YOU\\", a beautiful song about loss and dispair, you are drawn inside this album of the darkest nature, an album that explores subjects like death and adiction with such care and presision that you can't help but appreciate the talent behind every riff, behind every lyric and behind every single track.  Standouts are the singles \\"SAVE YOURSELF\\" and \\"HAUNTING ME\\" as well as the steller \\"SOMETIMES IT HURTS\\", a song so truthful (as far as conveying the feelings after loseing a loved one in death) that I was actually braught to tears after hear it.  \\"EVERYTHING I TOUCH\\" was actually the first song I ever heard by this band, and I was immediatly convinced that this was a CD to own.  \\"THE THING I HATE\\" is one of the most in your face angry songs ever and it delivers the adrenaline rush that metal lovers need while listening to this album which overall gives you more of a downer feeling (it's mood music people) so it's nice to have a MOSH-PIT perfect song.  \\"HOW CAN I HOLD ON\\" and \\"WHEN I'M DEAD\\" are standouts and worth a listen, but then again, so is this ENTIRE ALBUM SO BUY IT NOW!
055357342X|4.0|I devoured the first two novels, and leapt right into this one. And while I'm hooked, Martin's style is starting to tire me. I like how he ends each chapter on a little cliff-hanger. The problem is, he rarely picks up from where he leaves off. When he returns to the characters the crisis has been resolved, and we learn how in flashback.  <br /> <br />I've also had my fill of dwarf sex. The 'adult' scenes are just not well written at all.   <br /> <br />And one final gripe: this third book is pretty much 600+ pages of endless misery. Sure it's war and war is ugly. But even Tolstoy gave his characters a few moments of respite. This felt like a non-stop series of mutilations, humiliations, and torture. <br /> <br />So I give four stars, but only reluctantly. I still enjoy the plot twists, and I'm invested enough to want to know how the surviving characters fare. The ending was great.  I'm just worried that I won't be able to handle three more volumes of the same.
B00008EYA5|3.0|I'm a fan of the cast, Colin (although he needs to start making better movie choices or he's going to get swept under the radar), Michelle and LL...not a huge fan of Jackson although he's not terrible (kicked @$$ in Pulp Fiction but since he's run a little tired)  Anyways, that said, I just was not impressed entirly by this film.  Sure it has some nice eye-candy as far as special effects and good looking actors are concerned, BUT, the plot was just a little weak and, as has been said before, uninspired.  The story revolves around Jackson who is hired to put together a new S.W.A.T. team that consists of single mother Michelle and bad-boy Colin who has been penalized for a mistake made in the past and sentenced to work in the guncage.  You see, Colin's former boss (played by Larry Poindexter...who just let me say was my favorite charactor) hates his guts and so is unwilling to have Colin on the team.  But alas, its Jacksons team and so Colin is in.  After training and such the team gets the job of transporting the head of the European crime cartel (Olivier Martinez...is it just me or is this guy the most annoying actor alive...I just hate this guy!) to the pen...the only problem is he's declared on television that he'll give $100 million to anyone who gets him out.  So it only suits that every thug in the area tries to spring him.  The ending has a twist, but it's a twist that you saw coming so it's not that impressive.  Bottom line is, this is not a BAD movie, it's just not a GOOD one either.  I mean, I own it and have watched it more than once, but it's not a film that will stick with you, not a film that will really catch your eye...it's just there.  Watch it, but don't expect too much.
B00005JNEI|2.0|Michael Moore......a funny man with a funny cause. This movie is like a poor man's version of a Monty Python film. Moore takes some general \\"facts\\" about events related to the Bush administration and then procedes to fabricate some hilarious conclusions. <br /> <br />I have to admit that I laughed quite a few times during this movie. The charges levied against our current administration are enjoyable because they are so reaching and ridiculously extreme that you can't help but chuckle. Unfortunately, Moore isn't kidding....he actually thinks he is uncovering something important! <br /> <br />There used to be a great series on tv called \\"Connections\\" by James Burke. In this series, Burke does a remarkable job of tying together seemingly unrelated events in history into an insightful understanding of the effects that disparate events have on each other and the future. <br /> <br />Well......Moore attempts to do the same here, but he certainly lacks the keen, intellectual edge of Burke and his own clownish actions in the film take away from any legitimacy that he may be trying to portray. <br /> <br />Besides, I've noticed a huge amount of hypocracy from many of these wealthier liberal types: while they bash corporations and greed and governments, they are simultaneously investing and earning huge sums of money from these very same entities. For example, Moore owns stock in the Halliburton Corporation. This is the very same company that he bashes with accusations of war profiteering based on past connections with Vice President Cheney. <br /> <br />Many of our infamous liberal politician's and celebrities follow Moore's example. At the same time that they are leading the less educated and less informed down the path to liberal nirvana (socialism), they are cashing in big time in the same way that those naughty conservatives do - I guess their conscience looks the other way where wealth is concerned. <br /> <br />Overall, this movie has some entertainment value as a comedy, and it has a great deal of monetary value for Moore....which was the real point of his making this film, not his \\"patriotism\\". <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed out on the show when it originally aired, and only recently heard about it at a party when friends were raving about the series and movie. <br />Having just purchased the set of Firefly DVDs, and only watching the first two hour DVD, I am captivated (and haven't even seen the rest the series!)  I want to savor each episode!  Great by all accounts...actors, characters, writers, music, scenery...just fantastic!  I love the humor, the romance, the western/eastern flavor and the sci-fi elements.  Am looking forward to the movie and am hoping for more, as well!
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is just unbelievable! From now forward I WILL NOT SEE THE 'ACADEMY' AWARDS NO MORE! Well we've just seen in the Oscar night the 'new' 'Academy' President! <br />How can an excellent movie (or should I say only competent?) - like Crash - wins the Oscar for Best Picture Of The Year with such a masterpiece (indeed it's a work of Art) like Brokeback Mountain??? Who have the answer??? <br />Shame on the 'Academy'! <br /> <br />Crash is a movie about day life problems! That's all! Nothing more (...)! <br />Brokeback Mountain is an intemporal and universal Love story! Brilliantly filmed, played with such a deep meaningfull that you don't see that often in the movies! I'm sad... <br /> <br />Heartbroken!
B000002H2H|5.0|Everytime I look at fans of Metallica on TV or watch Fan's wearing a Metallica T Shirt,The First thing I get on my mind is 'Have these So Called Fan's aware of Metallica before black album???' <br />The first Metallica album I heard was The black album (like a million others) then it was reload (sad...then after that I went to that store and picked the first four albums at one go...man o man...I was blown away... <br />Now Lets get back to the album... <br />The albums opens with acoustic guitars...just thought WTF and then u get blown away...then it gets into a heavy thunderous mix of guitar riff's,drumming,bass and James's old Vocals(remember).The best part I like in the song is the drum - Double Bass in the middle of the song...awesome <br />Ride The Lightning - The title song...another long but awesome song.My fav part is the Solo by Dave Mustaine. <br />Then comes one of my all time Fav metallica songs - For whom the bell tolls...ohhh...check the bass,the bells and the word 'Take a look at the sky just before you die...'...awesome.Best version live would be on Cliff 'Em All. <br />Then comes Fade to Black.I just discovered this song When I was passing thru a depressing phase and this was my savior.I just cant count the number of times I've cried listening to this song.Just follow the solo's and you'd be lost and spellbound!!! <br />whenever you watch this song Live on video,look at the people's reaction...It means a lot to the people like me! <br />Next song is Trapped under Ice.Not really heard or a famous one. <br />Personally not my fav too.But a good solo tho. <br />Escape.I liked this song though many would disagree.I was in my teens and this was like a rebel Antheh.The closing part is good. <br />Next on the line is Creeping Death.What riffs,lyrics,Solo..the 4 guys had gone to a movie and while watching that Cliff said 'Creeping death' and woah a cool song title and it was born <br />Last but not the least would be 'the call of ktulu'.A instumental.Tell me how many metal bands can do a instrumental,let alone run it for 8 minutes! <br />Evertime I see this listen to this album makes me imagine what a band Metallica was and more importantly what music they Created. <br />If you consider yourself a fan of Metallica or metal music...You gotta have this.Otherwise u r not worth it!!!
0312330529|5.0|If I could give it 6 stars, I would. <br />One of the 4 or 5 best books I've ever read. What a book. <br />I hope Hollywood does it justice when the time comes. <br />And I look forward to the sequel and/or the prequel. <br />Wow. I'm just blown away.
B000025JU0|4.0|As another reviewer noted, this album marks OMD's departure from the more synthy/new-wavy/electronic sounds they embraced on earlier releases, especially Dazzle Ships. <br /> <br />Although Junk Culture doesn't fully embrace the pop culture as the follow up album, Crush, did, there was still a notable pop influence on this release.  I don't say that as a bad thing, either.  Good pop is still good music.  It's just a shame that there's so much *bad* pop, but I digress. <br /> <br />Junk Culture took a little bit of time to sink in with me.  I admit it.  I love Crush.  I suppose part of that is sentimental, as it was my girlfriend of the time (and wife now, so many years later) that exposed me to OMD via Crush.  I had always liked Organisation and their other, older albums.  Once I fell for Crush, though, I think the beauty of Junk Culture was finally exposed to me. <br /> <br />The great thing about Junk Culture is exactly its merging of the quirkiness of OMD's earlier material with the more pop-oriented melodies of the time.  Those two elements came together in Junk Culture to create a genuinely unique work.  You just can't go wrong with the eccentric Tesla Girls, the emotion of Love and Violence or the Latin flair of All Wrapped Up. <br /> <br />Any fan of the '80s owes it to themselves to own this album.  It may not be my favorite OMD album, but it does a great job of displaying both sides of the OMD coin.  It has also stood the test of time, in my opinion sounding as brilliant today as it did 20+ years ago.
6305263248|5.0|Why have I never heard of Ronin before?  This is a very thrilling movie with a wonderful international cast.  My fondness for Sean Bean lead me to this intelligent movie.  Inquiries and cars ambush, rush, collide through all the scenery of Paris, Nice and Arles. In some cases, even parking a car propelled the plot. The chases  zoom right up there with McQueen's Bullit. (Confused that I was sitting next to DeNiro or Reno, I kept reaching for my seatbelt.) The title offers a poetic metaphor that boosts the storytelling from a mundane shoot-em-up to a MacGuffin that would make Hitchcock take notice. The photography is stellar. The stunt work is amazing. The writing is good.  It warms up from a Pintaresque rhythm and then, through action and spoken word, plan and carry out the job and everthing else after. The actors masterfully embody the pros going after the package.  The villains are cold and evil. If there are good guys (I ain't spoilin' the surprises), they are played with all the complexity of humans having to find truth and making heavy choices. I adore the casting. I miss this in my movie going, but now I bask in having seen it for the first time.
B000002JK4|5.0|I've been listening to this since shortly after it was released.  This album knocked me out the first time, and I've only grown to enjoy it more and more over the years. <br /> <br />Plant seemed hesitant to release his Zeppelin past with Burning Down One Side, but Principle of Moments definitively laid down the roadmap for Plant's solo career with driving melodies, brilliant musicianship, and incredible vocals. <br /> <br />It must be difficult to do anything but \\"play backup\\" for someone like Robert Plant.  Once you've listened to this enough, though, you'll come to realize and appreciate Robbie Blunt's incredible guitar work.  Sure, he's no Jimmy Page, but this guy has got it going on.  The guitar solo in Horizontal Departure alone is worth the price of admission.  Few guitarists can say so much with so few notes.  It's short and to the point. <br /> <br />It's also hard to go wrong with Phil Collins banging the drums.  This was always Phil's strength.  It's 1982 and Phil is certainly not ripping out the incredible fills and beats in Genesis.  Their music was becoming simpler and more pop-oriented.  Principle of Moments assures us, though, that Phil is still an accomplished drummer. <br /> <br />These elements all combined to produce an album that I would not hesitate to say is among the best of the '80s.  Buy, listen, love.  It's very simple.
B00005JOFO|5.0|How could \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" LOSE to a movie like \\"Crash?\\"  Because the Academy has no guts and wanted to play it safe by voting for \\"Crash\\" so they would still look PC.  They're scared and too timid to reward a classic like this.  Did you see Jake's expression when \\"Crash\\" won??  He was steaming!  The Oscars are a joke.  Never again.
B000060OFT|5.0|Shakespeare's classic Romeo and Juliet at it's finest. Nothing could surpass this classic. An all-star cast of Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes give the movie life and color like no other. Everyone knows teh story, two households both alike in dignity...... a pair of star-crossed lover take their life.<br /><br />The scene: Verona Beach. The time: 20th Century. The meaning of the play: the same. Everyone knows that this Shakespeare classic is one of a kind. But, in the eyes of Baz Luhrmann, the director, this movie takes form. Funny scenes become hysterical. The Capulet party becomes outrageous. Everything matches in proportion. Nothing is missed. True, some scenes are taken out. Paris is alive by the end and Balthassar and Romeo don't fight right before his death. But, the form and meaning of the play stand tall.<br /><br />But one thing stood out in my mind: The dialogue is exactly the same which amazes me.<br /><br />I applaud Leonardo and Claire for their amazing performances. Baz tops all. This movie is a MUST SEE.
1573223085|5.0|I must admit to being a big fan of Daniel Pink. His previous book, Free Agent Nation, captured the radical shift in the tech sector, and provided me with the tools to thrive in a period of radical change. And now, what a stunning follow-up book!  <br /> <br />A Whole New Mind is full of clarity and insights. The author chronicles the shift taking place in our tech sector. And what is more important, he clearly puts his finger on the antidote to offshoring, and the challenges that these changes issue to Americans. <br /> <br />This book is a must read for those of us on the cutting edge of technology.  And a call for us to rediscover that creative edge which has so characterized us in the past. <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBH2|3.0|I debated whether I should give the picture 3 or 4 stars.  I obviously chose 3.  The problem with the production is simply it is too short to give full credit to Jane Austin's book.  That said, it is well executed, which is why debated between the two ratings. <br /> <br />The first problem is for those who have no prior familiarity with either the book or at minimum the two relatively recent much more lenghty mini series (the BBC-A&E version with Colin Firth of 1995 and--in my view, the better--BBC-Australian version with Elizabeth Garvie of 1990).  So much is cut from this version that the nuances of what Austin was trying to convey are simply missing.  The three younger Bennet daughters are hardly differentiated, mostly they giggle and it is even hard to figure out which one is which.  I have just seen Carey Mulligan as a wonderful Ada in Bleak House, and it took me most of the movie to recognize her as Kitty, the second youngest daughter.  Eventually Lydia becomes recognizeable but only because she gets married to Wickam.   <br /> <br />Wickham appears only briefly at the beginning and though he tells Lizzie of Darcy's alleged mistreatment of him, one never realizes from this movie that Lizzie is unduly intrigued by him and is in danger of succumbing to his false charms.  We do hear of his falsity from Darcy's famous letter, but nothing more is provided to flesh out Wickham's perfidy until he \\"elopes\\" with Lydia.  (In particular, the wise words of the housekeeper at Pemberley, a neutral source, on the perfidy of Wickham, an important fact for Lizzie, are simply missing.) <br /> <br />Although Charlotte appears early in the film, her significance is almost unnoted  Thus, it is unclear why it is of significance (to those who don't already know the book) that Mr. Collins marries her.  In general the repellant nature of Mr. Collins is seriously underplayed. He is almost a minor character. <br /> <br />Mr. Bingley's married sister and her shiftless husband are entirely missing.  The Bennet manse is presented almost as farm, not a gentleman's small estate.  On the other hand, Chatsworth one of the grandest estates in England, the seat of the Duke of Devonshire, is presented as Pemberley.  This is much grander than Fitzwilliam Darcy would likely to have.  Darcy is not a Duke, and not even a lord.  (The movie script suggests that Darcy owns half of Derbyshire, and nothing in the book remotely suggest this, and if he has \\"only\\" 10,000 [pounds] a year--the only sum mentioned in the movie or book--it is highly unlikely that he owns more than a few thousand acres of Derbyshire.  Even the extremely wealthy Duke of Devonshire doesn't own more than a small fraction of Derbyshire.   <br /> <br />I won't go on with the faults.  Why do I give it 3 stars and even consider 4 stars?  Mainly because the most central points, the evolution of Elizabeth Bennet, full of prejudice and Fitzwilliam Darcy, full of pride, are reasonably well developed and are extremely well acted--particularly well developed for Elizabeth Bennet.  A number (though not all) of the key scenes of this relationship are well presented (though in somewhat truncated form which was necessary for fitting the whole movie into an approximate two hour length required for commercial movies).  Lady Catherine de Bourgh's ill-fated attempt to derail the budding romance between Lizzie and Darcy is well done (though also a bit truncated).  Mrs. Bennet's hysteria was dealt with sympathetically. <br /> <br />I have read the book a half dozen times, seen the 1995 (Colin Firth) mini-series version a couple of times and the earlier Elizabeth Garvie mini-series version a dozen times, and so I know the story well enough to fill in for all of the important missing details.  With this prior knowledge, the plusses made it worthwhile for me to watch.  For someone is not particularly acquainted with Jane Austin's book (or last read it in high school many years ago) the movie provides a pleasant lovestory, even if it is seriously lacking in the subtlety of the original.  Knightley as Lizzie is a delight to look at and Macfayden may be the best Darcy on film--at least as far as the script allowed. <br /> <br />But, at best, it is the \\"highlights\\" of Pride and Prejudice and is no substitute for the book, or at minimum, one of the mini-series.  As I indicated above the Elizabeth Garvie version of 1990 is, in my view, the best.  Elizabeth Garvie is incredible, she simply \\"is\\" Elizabeth Bennet.  This version also adheres closest to the text of the book, and is now available on an inexpensive DVD--which, incidentally, is more complete than the earlier VHS version.  (However, the Lawrence Olivier movie of the 1940s is, in my mind, a complete travesty to be avoided like the plague.)
B00003CXA2|5.0|Critics of this movie who think that the Forrest character is a sentimental fiction just don't understand the grand irony of the film. Like many a \\"fair unknown\\" of early novelists -- from the the romancers of the Middle Ages to Henry Fielding in the 18th century -- Forrest, the archetypal innocent brilliantly played by Tom Hanks, teaches us to see the world anew.  <br /> <br />And what we learn is both enchanting and disenchanting. The film romps through three decades of the late 20th century, revealing the foibles of those times but also some of their finest potential. Forrest's run back and forth across the country is hilarious. My favorite line: \\"I'm pretty tired now. I think I'll go home.\\" <br /> <br />The music is almost an independent character, which threads its way throughout the film, helping not only to capture the spirit of the times but also to remind us as only music can of the rhythmic synchronicity of human life. This is also a rhythm that the circular plot and the repeating image of the feather brings forward. <br /> <br />Forrest's modesty makes space for my favorite character in the film: the magnificent Captain Dan (Gary Sinise), who Ahab-like dares God to bring on his worst -- and in the process proves both the resilience of the human spirit (and invites us to laugh at its pretensions). Sally Field (as Forrest's mama) and Robin Wright Penn (as Jenny) are also not bad.  <br /> <br />The naysayers who think their highbrow taste puts them above this film just do not understand what it's all about. Occasionally the movie itself forgets its own best intentions (\\"Life is just a box of chocolates\\" -- yuck), but given its overall achievement, it can be forgiven. <br />

B000002UB6|5.0|I have to fess up here, when I first heard this album, just prior to the Beatles' breakup, I thought this was their best yet! I guess because it seemed to have more songs that rocked than did their earlier albums. I also thought that George's guitar licks were more powerful and kickin' than some of his earlier stuff (I know, he did lots of great guitar work on the White album and others). But it just seemed that almost every song contained some good heavy rock and roll or bluesy guitar licks--John also was responsible for some of this. There is the whimpy but good \\"long and winding road\\" and \\"let it be\\" that certainly neutralizes some of the down and dirty rock stuff like \\"I dig a Pony, I got a Feeling, Get Back and 909.\\" In later years, say the early to mid 80's I used to have some heated discussions with the \\"younger\\" crowd who claimed the Beatles were just a \\"whimp rock, bubble gum\\" group. I would always bring up \\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"My Guitar Gently weeps\\" and others...\\"Let it Be\\" would be the album I'd recommend they try.  But anyhow, back to my thinking this was the Beatles' best: I later came to my senses and realized the collaborative genius, which was the Beatles, really was contained in Revolver, Mystery Tour, Sgt. Peppers, The White Album and Abbey Road...not to mention some special albums that were released in 63, 64, and 65 that were ultimately a collection of number one thru twenty Billboard hits...but \\"Let it Be\\" along with Abbey Road and The White one still get the majority of play at my house, with Let it Be and Abbey Road virtually tied for first place...so be it...don't pay attention to the critics, it's a great, great album.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Directed by Ang Lee and starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, this is easily the most talked-about motion picture of the year, if not the decade. With all the controversy, the criticism, the parodies, it's hard to imagine anyone visiting this site not already familar with much of what takes place in this film. But out of respect for those who haven't seen it, my review contains absolutely NO spoilers. <br /> <br />Brokeback tells the story of Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal), a pair of young ranch hands who over the course of an early '60s summer in Wyoming discover that they really enjoy doing things together. Things like swimming, fishing, horseback riding and just about anything else that might strike their fancy. But there's one catch: they really, really like doing things together. Like more than they've ever liked doing things with anyone else before. Herein lies the film's universality, as I think we all remember that one buddy from summer camp with whom we just could not part ways. Anyone who's been through that experience or anything similar will surely identify with the characters in this film, to some extent. <br /> <br />So Ennis and Jack promise to be Best Friends Forever while agreeing to keep it \\"on the downlow\\", so to speak, as they both get married and start their lives in earnest. But neither can escape the feeling that they'd really rather be doing things together. They agree to get together once a year and return to Brokeback Mountain - and who can blame them? The scenery is gorgeous. However, the wives (Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams) get a little concerned, as wives tend to do when a husband is spending all his time horsing around with one of his close pals and ignoring the homefront. Again, this is a movie that nearly every American male will relate to, though perhaps some more than others.  <br /> <br />As the film progresses, taking us further into the character's lives, it takes on tragic dimensions. We come to feelthat Ennis and Jack were destined to do things together but their lives have been undone by society's tendency to frown upon certain people doing things together. Yes, it's a downer.  <br /> <br />But Brokeback Mountain is also a very thought-provoking film. I thought about it an awful lot afterwards, which is odd since I've never been a fan of cowboy movies. Certain scenes replayed in my thoughts a lot - so much so that I had to mentally recast the film just to get it out of my head; my version of Brokeback stars Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti. It's just as well-acted but a little less thought-provoking. <br /> <br />So cheers to Brokeback Mountain - the Best Picture of the Year! <br />
B0000844I8|5.0|My dad and I first saw this around 5 years ago, and it has been a favorite ever since. The musical score by David Arnold is breathtaking, as are the special effects and story line. The acting by Kurt Russel and James Spader is also great.  SEE THIS
B000E33VWW|5.0|Naturally, the story of an ambitious eccentric who inserts himself into a major news event with seemingly little concern for the real people involved has great resonance with me. I probably haven't identified so strongly with a character on screen since PSH's earlier role in Happiness. Hoffman doesn't just play Truman Capote, he IS Truman Capote, in a performance so convincing that even months after the film's release, Liza Minelli is still calling him up at 3:00 am and demanding to raid his Quaalude stash. The film also provides fascinating insight into the literary world of the 1960s; who knew that famed To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee (played by the exquisite Catherine Keener) was also one of the world's first \\"fag hags\\"?    It's in the story of Capote's relationship with a convicted killer, Robert Blake, that we see what an innovator the man really was. We witness how he pioneered the \\"non-fiction novel\\", a concept which the likes of James Frey have recently picked up and taken to new heights. With that in mind, it's too bad that Truman largely operated before the age of crack and Oprah because he really could've been somebody. Instead he became a sad, wasted figure chatting it up with celebrities at drug-and-sex-infested parties at Studio 54 - ie. living the American dream. (...)The whole film made me want to pull out my well-worn, yellowed-out copy of In Cold Blood and actually read it instead of wearing it and coloring it yellow.    So cheers to Capote - the Best Picture of the year!

0307276902|5.0|I was on vacation back home and noticed my mom was reading this book so i picked up her copy and read the back.  It looked pretty interesting so I was just gonna read the first page to get a little taste but then i couldnt stop reading.  Pretty soon i was on page 80 and found myself reading this book every chance i got.  This book is soo good that i found myself staying up into the late hours of night even when i could barely keep my eyes open.  Despite all the recent controversy it is an awesome read. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages and anyone looking for some inspiration.

B000AWYOGE|3.0|Given the way Dark Water was advertised it's only understandable to expect some grade A suspense, however that's not very true. If you take what you're given though, it's a decent movie, if only for Jennifer Connelly fans.<br /><br />I understand that Walter Salles probably wanted to make a different kind of horror/suspense movie, and I appreciate that effort, but he fell terribly short of the goal. First off, the only two suspenseful parts are when Ceci (Gade) refuses to talk to Natasha (Haney-Jardine) during school which ends with a confrontation in the bathroom and then when Natasha is drowning Ceci while Dahlia (Connelly) is trying to help her.<br /><br />From a strickly acting point of view, this movie is chock-full of great performances. Jennifer Connelly, like always, is great, her daughter in the movie, Ariel Gade, puts on quite the believable performance, and John C. Reilly injects a subtle humor into his role as Mr. Murray.<br /><br />As much as I wanted to love this movie, I don't. Basically the plot seems to deal with domestic drama more than the actual 'dark water.' There's several occassions where something intense could've happened or been built upon, but it wasn't, instead we're treated to Connelly's character looking back at how her mother didn't love her. So whether you take this film for what it is or not, most likely you'll come out disappointed.
0688170528|3.0|The copy I bought has a sticker on it saying, \\"Now a Lifetime Original Movie\\".  Well, it sure read like one.  Not a bad premise for a story, but the execution just didn't cut it for me.  I didn't find the characters believable or sympathetic, especially the romantic relationships.  And the writing was mediocre, and overly cliche'-ed.  Of *course* Emily was a tortured artist, and of *course* she painted a picture with a skull and black clouds when she was depressed. <br /> <br />Ironically enough, there were some minor errors that really irked me.  She wrote that Chris drove around a corner and slammed his stick shift car into park.  Well, stick shift cars don't have park.  And then one of the characters was flying to Paris, though New York's LaGuardia airport.  But, LaGuardia isn't an international airport.  And then Chris' English essay was referred to as being \\"pro-choice\\", which it definitely was NOT.  I suppose these are things that an editor/agent should be catching, but it just sort of makes me feel even more than this was a production-mill kind of story--got an idea?  Good, let's churn out a book as fast as we can and make a TV movie out of it. <br /> <br />I picked it up expecting some mildly entertaining fluffy reading for a weekend.  Admitted, I couldn't put it down at first, but towards the end I read faster and faster, wanting it to end.  Not resolve, but end.  I got fluffy reading, but next time I'm in the mood for some weekend reading, I won't be stopping by the Picoult shelf.
0385513755|5.0|Quite honestly, I am not the type of person to hop on a bandwagon so I did not buy this book during the height of its popularity.  Instead, I am just a fan of Tom Hanks movies and when I heard that he was to star as Robert Langdon, the main character of this book, in a Ron Howard production, I figured I had better get reading!  As we all know, books are always better that the movies.<br /><br />This was to be my first real book (with paragraphs) since entering motherhood, and to my surprise this book was an absolute delight.  The illustrations saved quite a bit of extra research time and it is essentially light reading.  Therefore, it is well worth the extra cost of purchasing the illustrated version.<br /><br />This was my first Dan Brown book and I enjoyed it so much that I am now purchasing a couple of others.<br /><br />Many have spoken out against this book but please don't get caught up in the controversy!  It is just a book to enjoy.

B00003003R|5.0|This collection is a must-have for Guns N' Roses fans, and it is also very likely to please rock fans in general.  I do have two minor complaints, though: <br />  <br />First, I would like to have seen the band line-up given for each individual song, as they did on \\"Use Your Illusion\\" and \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\" <br /> <br />Second, some of the performances do indeed sound as if they have been \\"doctored\\" in-studio---the audio quality is suspiciously high for a live performance (though I should say that this in no way detracts from the album). <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very good collection that is definitely worth picking-up.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Title says it all. She's good and I'm a fan. And this is her best release to this point and subsequent. Warm, quiet swing, and terrific side men. A bit more piano work displayed here on several tracks. Performance nearly identical also available on DVD. Recommend both. Doesn't get any better.
1591396190|1.0|In the end this book fails to deliver usable business tools because of one huge flaw: It completely misrepresents the nature of innovation.<br /><br />The problem is the role the book gives to innovation. When the Blue Ocean strategic process is outlined, only one point out of 10 mentions new ideas, saying \\"See which factors you should eliminate, create or change\\". In other words, one word (\\"create\\") in one sentence focuses on the actual process of creating new ideas - everything else is strategy. That's not the way it works.<br /><br />This is typical of the way many businesses misunderstand creativity. There's a widespread illusion that innovation happens like this:<br />A manager somewhere notices an untapped business opportunity<br />He tasks someone with finding a way to tap that potential<br />Someone comes up with an idea that matches the opportunity<br />The idea is implemented<br /><br />In real life, however, innovation usually happens like this:<br />Somebody, somewhere in the organizations has an idea - often totally unrelated to his actual job<br />He tries to interest others in it and is told to drop it<br />He perseveres and finally someone else agrees to try it out<br />The company suddenly discovers that it has a runaway hit on its hands<br /><br />If you don't believe me, read this story of how post-its were invented at 3M ([...]). If ever there was a Blue Ocean product this is it, but the process was most definitely NOT as described in the Blue Ocean book.<br /><br />It is my firm belief that few companies will be able to apply the tools in the Blue Ocean book to actually create ground-breaking innovation - even the cases cited in the book support this. A measured strategic approach like the one described here is fine for creating measured, incremental change, but if you really want to take your business into uncharted water, you will need a completely different approach to innovation.

1400049628|2.0|Zombies make honey and others don't.  This simple line yields more humor than the entire book.  I expected that this would be hilarious because the concept is so ridiculous, but instead the author chooses to write a pseudo-factual book for actual survival.  The problem: there are no zombies and we don't really need to prepare.  It is weighed down by unimaginative explanations for the genesis and capabilities of zombies.   Often, opportunities for creativity or humor are competely missed.  Many, if not most questions of how one can avoid infection or conversion are simply answered as \\"You can't.\\"  If you are looking for a survival guide, check out the SAS Survival Handbok.  If you like zombies get Night of the Living Dead.  Waste neither your time nor your money on this book.
B000E1155E|4.0|Arctic Monkeys - Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (Domino, 2006) <br /> <br />Review By Timothy Cunningham <br /> <br />   <br />Taken as a whole, the Arctic Monkeys' debut, Whatever People Say I am, That's What I'm Not, is really nothing new. Loud guitars, fast paced singing, and smacking drums adorn most of the album. What really makes this album so great? It has energy and lots of it. <br /> <br />The album starts off with The View From The Afternoon, easily one of the best songs on the album. Switching between fast punk rock and mid-tempo pop, the song conveys a vivid sense of emotion and craziness in search for love in pubs. The second song, I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor, further expands on this topic. You've had a few at the local tavern and that girl you've had your eyes on the whole night is eyeing you up. She notices you looking at her and she looks away. \\"I wish you'd stop ignoring me, because it's sending me to despair / without a sound yeah you're calling me, and I don't think it's very fair.\\" Or maybe not? \\"And oh there ain't no love no, Montagues or Capulets / Just banging tunes `n' DJ set `n' / Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness.\\" I mean c'mon. How can a song with lyrics like that not be great? Following that is Fakes Tales of San Francisco, a song about British bands trying to sound American. Then back to being infatuated in a pub or club - Dancing Shoes fits the bill. Insanely catchy, it puts to the forefront lead singer and guitarist Alex Turner's great voice. You can only guess what it's about. Building on the merits of the first song, You Probably Couldn't See For The Lights But You Were Looking Straight At Me shows the drumming and backup vocal skills of Matt Helders. The song whips by in a flash. Literally, it really does. Next, Still Take You Home. Yeah, it's about that chick that is oh-so-hot but as dumb as a board. And, why not? Well, that's what Alex says! A nice punk rock song with a nice instrumental bit nearthe end. The Monkeys slow it down, just for a moment, with Riot Van. Not my favorite, but a song that suggests that they're not just a punk rock band. It's about the days long ago and squabbles with the police. Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured comes up next and boy it is secure. It has one of the catchiest riffs on the record. Like most of the songs on the album, it flies by at a frenetic pace. <br /> <br />The Arctic Monkeys once again switch tempo with Mardy Bum. Alex's voice really shines here, though early recorded demo versions are far superior. What the hell is Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong But... about? I have no clue. But the song is pure punk rock. With lyrics like, \\"Cause all you people are vampires / And all your stories are stale / And though you pretend to stand by us / I know you're certain we'll fail,\\" how can they fail? A jab at the older generation, always questioning what the younger generation is doing or will be doing? A jab at establishment or the music industry in general? When The Sun Goes Down begins with a nice melodic guitar, but soon explodes into a single note rock masterpiece. From The Ritz To The Rubble begins with a rap-rock tale of girlfriends, beer, and bouncers - once again a killer ending riff. The album concludes quite calmly (after a hard rock intro) with A Certain Romance, the longest track on the album. \\"And over there there's broken bones / There's only music, so that there's new ringtones / And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes / To see it's a little different around here.\\" <br /> <br />What separates this band from many of their contemporaries is a lyrical wittiness and lightning fast vocal delivery from songwriter and guitarist Alex Turner. Filling out the line up is bassist Andy Nicholson and guitarist Jamie Cook. Whatever People Say I am, That's What I'm not is quite a debut from these 19 and 20 somethings from England. They sure are in love with long titles!

B00005JOM9|3.0|On NPR today, Felicity Huffman's voice coach, Andrea James, was interviewed. She is the number one trainer of the stars to sound like men pretending to be women. I must say that she has that talent herself. The segment did not mention the obscene pictures of Michael Bailey's children that Andrea James had on her wesite during 2003. I wonder what Felicity Huffman would say about that. Perhaps Andrea James told her about them?
B00003CXB7|5.0|I was in my 20's when the original movie came out.  Nothing I have ever seen yet,  has ever made me laugh so much.  Why do all you people take this movie so seriously.  It is a comedy!!!!  Even though I have a very hard time liking Alan Alda and that other \\"Trapper\\" because of their politics, I still never get tired of watching MASH in any form.  It is just hillarious.   Yes, war is hell, but then laughter is the best medicine you know.  It keeps us alive. My husband was in Vietnam as were many of my friends and family fighting for our freedom in a war that went nowhere.  Some of my family fought in WWII and Korea too.  The younger people today that have not had to fight in a war or make sacrifies will not \\"get\\" the humor of this movie. Lighten up!!!!  I feel sorry for you.

B000B8QF14|5.0|For a real critique of the DVD editing etc... you are referred to previous reviewers.  I don't really know alot about that.  I do know that I have borrowed this DVD from Netflix twice and we have watched it over and over and over.  Hence, I am here at Amazon to buy it.  It's great, and I truly enjoy the insights into the lives of the band members.  I kind of like how the interviews are interspersed throughout the concert footage, otherwise I would probably just watch the music over and over.  You can go directly to \\"chapters\\" and watch the songs you like.  The sound is good, and if you are a political progressive in a conservative state, the political statements can be affirmitive (that's a good thing).  If you like Green Day, you will not regret having this DVD.
B000E1155E|5.0|I was recently reading a Time Magazine article about the Arctic Monkeys and I decided I needed to purchase the CD once it was available...I am so glad I did. <br />Although it was a bit hyped the album is great. It is such a fun album to listen to from start to finish. If you are looking for some great lyrics and fun music this is the album for you. Many people say they are dissapointed in this album but what were they expecting the next Beatles? No Way! this album is great and I recommend it to anyone who asks. <br />Highlights:  <br />I Bet that you would look good on the dancefloor <br />Fake Tales of San Francisco <br />Mardy Bum <br />A Certain Romance
B000BW7QWW|2.0|I do not see what the hype is about.  The story is unoriginal.  Characters are paper thin.  Action is underwhelming (the space battle sequence is less than 3 minutes).  Humor is ill attempted.  Serenity makes Phantom Menace (a rather weak episode in Star Wars saga) seem like a grand masterpiece.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Yes, the BBC miniseries is good, but this movie did a wonderful job with the 2 hours it was given.  Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen are brilliant in their roles and you can seriously feel the tension between them throughout the movie.  I rarely see movies more than once in the theater, but I did go to see this one twice and couldn't wait for the DVD to come out.  It's very simply a love story with beautiful scenery, outstanding dialogue, an excellent cast, and some very poignant moments.  What's not to love?
B000E97X66|5.0|I caught alot of the DVD on PBS marathon the other night ,and picked up this double disk today. I have lived in New Jersey all my life so \\"the Bruce Springsteen Legend\\" has always been around me.I saw bruce with the E-street band in 99 ,and it was a great show, he had alot more songs in his catolog than this shoow from 75. i have always thought of Bruce Springsteen as one of the great singer song writers of the last 40 years ,Someone who was able to write a story in song that you could feel how the character was feeling, He ,along with Dylan,Neil Young ,Lou Reed ,and Tom Waits are able to pen songs about people we have known, been , didn't want to be ,or dreamed of being. His albums from \\"Greetings from Asbury Park to The River are (to me) the classic E-street sound. <br /> His solo acoustic albums \\"Nebraska, Ghost of Tom Joad ,and Devils & Dust\\" show that he can hold his own with out the E street band,and songs that he's writen for Movie Sound tracks \\"Philadelphia ,and Dead Man Walking\\" are great as well . <br /> Every time that Bruce tours with the E-Street band it's a huge event ,and its held in a huge arena ,its been that way since the River tour ,and alot of the live recordings have been from arena shows that have alot of energy. <br /> This recording has a tenderness ,and soulfulness that I have heard about only from word of mouth from people who saw Springsteen in the early 70's. Born to Run ,Thunder Road , Jungleland ,and Rosalita (Come Out Tonight),are classics ,but songs .like ost in the Flood, , and for you make this recording great.The extended jam on Kittys Back, or Little Steven playing slide on The E-street Shuffle, are Rarities that any fan of the E-Street band should have. <br /> Also the fact that its the first time that they were England plays alot on the atmosphere of the whole recording.The sound is raw and honest. The CD is great from top to bottom. <br />
B000BBOUU4|3.0|The movie isn't bad... there are some neat visuals and most of the special effects are outstanding. Deep Roy as the ONLY Oompa Loompa, though, got a bit annoying.... he was in the film more than any other actor... over and over and over... just kinda creepy. The original film has definitely not been surpassed here in terms of creativity, originality, or the story.<br /><br />Not a bad film at all, just super weird and the whole movie felt unnecessary, and Johnny Depp's portrayal of Wonka was the ultimate in bizarre, but I liked it.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|wow, what can I say, just got my copy a few weeks ago and I have not stopped playing it since. This is the essential Michael Jackson, if that isn't the understatement of the year. Listening to this great compelation of songs brought all kinds of memories flooding back, from going to kiddie parties as a youngster, and attending college in my teens. The first Cd contains songs with the jackson five and earlier work from his solo career. What a great song \\"ben\\" is, listening to a child singing such a nice song was truely heart warming and made me appreciate him more . This song along with my favourite \\"human nature\\", rockin robin, the girl is mine and the Gad damn rest of the first CD is one hell of a collection that I can only describe as classic MJ. But boy o boy, the second Cd fights back hard, with dirty diana, smooth criminal, who is it and the rest just left me feeling great appreciation for the work of a genius. This is indeed great value for money and am planning to buy an extra copy for a friend as a birthday present.
B0000AKY7O|4.0|Just as on their previous release, Caravanserai, Welcome sees Santana complementing their Latin rock sound with a jazz feel. Although there aren't any bonafide classics here like \\"Evil Ways\\" or \\"Black Magic Woman\\", the music and lyrics on Welcome embrace spirituality more than their music had previously. Also worth noting is that while Caravanserai must be listened to its entirety to fully digest, Welcome is more of a song-based collection. The opening \\"Going Home\\" continues the Santana trend of the instrumental opener providing the feel for the rest of the album. In this case, the organs provide a majestic churchlike feel before piano and Carlos' ringing guitar lines provide a feeling of peace. This kicks right into the funky \\"Love, Devotion and Surrender\\", a track where Carlos, Wendy Haas, and Leon Thomas share vocal duties, with each of them adding a little more emotion as the song progresses. \\"When I Look Into Your Eyes\\" is a love poem put to music with a dated keyboard outro while the excellent \\"Yours Is The Light\\" features near operatic vocals from Flora Purim. \\"Light Of Life\\", with its strings and majestic vocals from Thomas, is also a highlight. As for the instrumentals, both \\"Mother Africa\\" and \\"Flame Sky\\" are two of the band's best with the former featuring a killer sax solo from Jules Broussard while the latter contains wicked solos from both Carlos and guest guitarist John McLaughlin. The original closing title track projects a similar feel to its opener, one of eternal peace. The bonus track, \\"Mantra\\", has a very chaotic feel, similar in intensity to \\"Flame Sky\\", and complements the album well. Although not quite as cohesive as their first four albums, Welcome is a strong musical statement that still blows most of today's music, including Santana's more recent output, right out of the water.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|This is the first of Hallstrom's films that I've seen, and I gather it's by no means typical of his recent work. However, I found it immensely entertaining. It bears little reference to the Chevalier de Seingalt's life, but once you've got over that (ideally before you see it) it is highly enjoyable. The imaginative and brilliant photography of a Venice peopled with the colourful characters and costumes of the ridotto in the city's heyday makes the film worth seeing for that alone. Venice should always look this good; its inhabitants should always wear the costume of this period. <br /> <br />Then the acting is good and plausible. I spent some time trying to work out who it was that Heath Ledger reminded me of, and eventually realised that it was Russell Crowe, not so much in looks as something about his manner. Jeremy Irons is hilarious and others well up to par. The film was well-paced, building to a comic finale.  <br /> <br />I think the great point is to grasp that the whole thing was clearly conceived as a sort of Commedia dell'Arte, knockabout farce with very little sex but plenty of misunderstandings, mistaken identities and laugh-out-loud moments. And, of course, love. I thought it was made in very much the manner that operas like The Marriage of Figaro or The Barber of Seville would have been conceived and performed in when they first came out - in fact it shed new light on those for me. <br /> <br />Not a great film - it's a bit too slight for that - but a good, well-made, highly enjoyable romp.
0525948023|4.0|Caution: move slowly through this review and give the whole message a chance, especially if you are a die hard Eckhart Tolle fan. I am still a big fan, but this time, there is something amiss and I'm left feeling like I want to say \\"Leggo my Ego.\\"<br /><br />\\"A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\\" is Eckhart Tolle's latest eye opening book and other probable hit on the best seller list. I found his latest book even more filled with great teaching and also, in some parts, quite a bit more difficult to accept than \\"The Power of Now\\".<br /><br />While in the \\"Power of Now\\", I felt that Tolle's term ego was more self evidently limited to thoughts that arise out of the not always so helpful conditioning of our past, in \\"A New Earth\\" I sensed there might be a new level of meaning added to his use of \\"ego\\" that seems a bit over the top. Of course, this could be my ego running away with me, wink, wink, nudge, nudge. However, there are certain passages in Tolle's new book that had me wondering whether Tolle now is teaching some concepts that fly in the face of the beauty of this world. While I'm not sure that Tolle meant to be interpreted in this way and I can appreciate that his concepts could be as true as anything that I believe, this time around there are some feelings I have about some of what he is saying that I believe should not be too easily dismissed.<br /><br />What am I talking about? I'm referring to Tolle's statement about the end of belief systems, his contradictory references to moral relativism, and how he curiously points to the lack of the existence of anything personal as the truth in what appears to be his confusion of Source with the self.<br /><br />Okay, I'm found out. I happened to have gotten a degree in Social and Cultural Anthropology, so of course, when I read that \\"we are coming to the end not only of mythologies but also of ideologies and belief systems,\\" (p. 21) my attention stood straight up. I can imagine a world without mythology, but personally (there I go again), I'd like to keep at least history of it so we can have something to do besides snore. Maybe I can go as far as imagining a life sans ideology at the macro level, but my heart starts to hurt when all of our beliefs go. Why? I say so because to me our beliefs are both the potential for all good as well as bad. Here sits our raison d'être in the seat of free will and of the purpose of duality itself. If there is nothing to believe, if all truth is known in the absolute, then there is no choice and furthermore, there is no more learning. Perhaps this is the goal, the Omega Point, I don't know, but something tells me that learning (requiring mistakes) is just as easily a part of the expansion of the Universe - eternally.<br /><br />On the topic of relative and absolute truth Tolle has me logically baffled and also questioning the level of spiritual inspiration for parts of this new book. On the one hand, I fully understand the spirit behind the idea that a \\"right versus wrong\\" attitude is behind so much conflict and violence in the world. There is no doubt about that. But then Tolle goes on:<br /><br />\\"...does that mean there is no such thing as right or wrong behavior, action, or belief? And wouldn't that be the moral relativism that some contemporary Christian teachings see as the great evil of our times? The history of Christianity is, of course, a prime example of how the belief that you are in sole possession of the truth, that is to say, right, can corrupt your actions and behavior to the point of insanity. For centuries, torturing and burning people alive if their opinion diverged even in the slightest from the Church doctrine or narrow interpretations of scripture (the \\"Truth\\") was considered right because the victims were 'wrong.'<br /><br />... [a paragraph down the way]<br /><br />The Catholic and other churches are actually correct when they identify relativism, the belief that there is no absolute truth to guide human behavior, as one of the evils of our times.... (p.69-70) .<br /><br />[Much further into the book] \\"Does this mean that people are not responsible for what they do when possessed by the pain-body? My answer is: How can they be? How can you be responsible when you are unconscious? However, in the greater scheme of things, human beings are meant to evolve into conscious beings, and those who don't will suffer the consequences of their unconsciousness.\\" (p.163).<br /><br />Ah, the relative truth is just so hard to understand sometimes. And, Tolle verges on making a Boomeritis mistake. (Check out the boomer philosopher Ken Wilbur's book for the origins of the term Boomeritis. Wilbur makes a darn good argument that relativism leads to extremely egoistic, even narcissistic behavior). Tolle's mistake is that he doesn't make it clear that at the level in which we live, accountability is a must, but that on the level consciousness of the Divine, accountability for the unconscious mistake makes no sense and is not in keeping with Divine Mercy. I think Einstein had a handle on it when he said \\"No problem can be solved from the level of consciousness from which it was created.\\" However, that doesn't mean we should or even can skip all the way to the absolute level. Wouldn't it defeat the purpose of having experiences in time if we could just skip it and Be God? It's all for the greater good.<br /><br />Yes, in my belief system we must hold each other accountable for our actions even though we do not have the benefit of the perspective of the absolute. We obviously do not do a good job of holding each other accountable and the current use of the death penalty among so many other brutal practices point to this. So, let's improve, but please, I don't want the Hells Angels to be security guards at the next concert that I attend and I'm really feeling weak kneed at the idea of my child's next school teacher being a redeemed child molester.<br /><br />Next let's take a look at some of what Tolle says about all things personal and what seems to be a confusion of Source with oneself. While I seek to become one with I Am, I do not believe that I Am (God Himself/Herself). Instead I believe that I am OF God I Am and that I am truly one with I Am in eternity similarly to the way that my finger is a part of my body in the world of the finite. I also believe that my personality and my experiences are a gift forevermore if I so choose. I am not simply a total illusion whose reality is only that of an impersonal and neutral God who is using my eyes and personality filter to experience a unique view. Existence is existence. It is not a television show with virtual experiential capabilities and simultaneous observation capability - God as actor and as spectator, while the actor's consciousness apart from being God is an illusion. Whew. That Seems like a cruel joke if it is true.<br /><br />Perhaps it is easier to think of the Universe impersonal because our minds have so much trouble imagining the infinite number of unique personalities. But, in my experience, and this is probably only really understandable at an experiential level, God is both impersonal and very, very personal. And, all of the celestial and mortal beings who live in this Universe are undoubtedly personal and uniquely individual.<br /><br />Maybe it's just easier to overcome our negative and imbalanced egos and become balanced and forgiving human beings by depersonalizing our viewpoints. However, it seems to me that the concept of each of us being the impersonal God I Am tips the scale of balance over to the other side with too much weight being added. On this point and without fear of being judged as egoistic, I'll stand by my personality as the essence that I recognize as myself through the window of my eyes when I look in the mirror. Though my body will perish, the unique essence of my soul, the snowflake that I am in the blanket of snow that is I Am will live on. That is God's gift to meand the gift that I have in common with each of my fellows.<br /><br />Stay tuned for part two - the rest of the review and the reason why in spite of part one of my review, \\"A New Earth\\" is definitely still a great book and a keeper.<br /><br />Part Two: Now that we've reviewed the bath water of Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth, let's get to the baby, and this baby is beautiful, inspiring, and wise. As I mentioned in part one of my book review, my perspective on the ego, belief systems and moral relativism differs from what Tolle has spelled out. However, though I felt some of his views are potentially harmfully extreme, I still found this book utterly worthy of praise.<br /><br />Why? It's simple. There is a great deal of profound wisdom in A New Earth. The wisdom contained in it is so uplifting that just the act of reading it will raise your spirit. And, if you live by some of Tolle's insights, you'll improve the quality of your life exponentially.<br /><br />What I am struck by in A New Earth are the ideas that shift us from a false sense of ourselves to what's really in our hearts. Tolle wraps all that's not truly worthy of each of us into the term ego. Instead of ego, I'd prefer to call it, as I've heard it in another system called Human Design, the \\"not self\\". Tolle shows us that we've been living lives mostly guided by the conditioning of our families, our communities, and our cultural hertitage. This conditioning creates the not self. Certainly not all of that conditioning is bad.

I do believe, however, that a great deal of people will find it to be more enjoyable than that.review and the reason why in spite of part one of my review, \\"A New Earth\\" is definitely still a great book and a keeper.    Part Two: Now that we've reviewed the bath water of Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth, let's get to the baby, and this baby is beautiful, inspiring, and wise. As I mentioned in part one of my book review, my perspective on the ego, belief systems and moral relativism differs from what Tolle has spelled out. However, though I felt some of his views are potentially harmfully extreme, I still found this book utterly worthy of praise.     Why? It's simple. There is a great deal of profound wisdom in A New Earth. The wisdom contained in it is so uplifting that just the act of reading it will raise your spirit. And, if you live by some of Tolle's insights, you'll improve the quality of your life exponentially.    What I am struck by in A New Earth are the ideas that shift us from a false sense of ourselves to what's really in our hearts. Tolle wraps all that's not truly worthy of each of us into the term ego. Instead of ego, I'd prefer to call it, as I've heard it in another system called Human Design, the \\"not self\\". Tolle shows us that we've been living lives mostly guided by the conditioning of our families, our communities, and our cultural hertitage. This conditioning creates the not self. Certainly not all of that conditioning is bad. But, if we allow our lives to be run by views that we have never considered, never observed in own our behaviour, or never examined against the experiences produced by these views, we are most likely causing stress, unhappiness, numbness, or worse for ourselves and others around us.    Here are a few excerpts that I enjoyed.    \\"You do not become good by trying to be good, but by finding the goodness that is already within you, and allowing that goodness to emerge.\\" (P. 13)    \\"Whenever tragic loss occurs, you either resist or you yield.

B000BEZQ18|4.0|I went to see Brokeback Mountain a few nights ago with my girl and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I would come to enjoy the movie; the characters were really fleshed out well, and the love portrayed between the two cowboys played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger was very believable.   Also the musical score, by Gustavo Santaolalla, was beautifully done.  Almost every song picked for each corresponding scene fit amazingly well.  The music was so good I went to pick up the soundtrack the next day.  After I brought it home and listened to it I was surprised to find that the song \\"I Love Doing Texas With You\\", sung by Kevin Trainer, courtesy of ACM Records, wasn't included.  This song, which was recorded in the same time period the movie was set in, seemed to be a perfect fit; I don't know why it wasn't included.  The powerful scene where it's played in (Ennis, played by Heath Ledger, is anxiously making arrangements to go on a fishing trip with Jack, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and Ennis's wife Lureen, played by Anne Hathaway, is a little suspicious of the trip.  \\"I Love Doing Texas With You\\" is heard blasting through a radio in the kitchen.  By the time this scene is shown, Ennis's wife knows somethings going on and she's heartbreakingly perplexed.)  It's ironic because she knows that her husband is possibly \\"Doing Texas\\" with someone else.  If (With a little research I was able to find some info on [...])  I still liked the soundtrack, but if that key song wasn't left out I would have loved it!

This book needs an open mind approach to understand and appreciate it.

0307263118|2.0|Banville's latest book is an exercise in languish airs, tedious, overwritten not because the subject matter demands it, but because the character development is so lacking and the plot so vacuous, tiresome, and cliched, that his \\"poetics,\\" are all Banville has left to wield.<br /><br />I cannot believe that critics have compared this novel to Nabokov's!  Yes, the primary figure in the novel, Max, has some of the same odd and perhaps perverse persuasions as Lolita's Humbert.  But the writing styles COULD NOT BE MORE DIFFERENT.  Where Nabokov's style is witty and frolicksome,  even contemptuous, Banville wallows and flails, revists the same tired language, his words all heavy and each one seemingly inserted in the story to add to the compounding, sticky, overwrought DRAMA of his boring, boring subject.  And Faulkner? Compare this to Faulkner?  Where, tell me, is the interesting narrative structure, the polyphonic dialogue of characters, the darkness that is LEFT TO THE READER TO INFER.<br /><br />Maybe that's it. Maybe this book leaves nothing to the imagination.  I can't go anywhere beyond this narrative, this story of a contemptible, obnoxiously selfish brute.  Give me Leopold Bloom's wanderings, Quentin's steady endurance of history, where I'll happily let my brain roam between the words, putting pieces of a puzzle together, enjoying the characters even when I despise them, wondering what they will do next.  There is no mystery here, no life, nothing in this novel.<br /><br />And perhaps I'm fine with people comparing him to Beckett, for I have always found Beckett to be a tremendous show-off, like a poorly behaved child, writing feverishly so that people may pay attention to his work, and then mocking them for their interest, for investing any energy into this world of words that he profited from. Why write? And why should I invest my time in reading?<br /><br />As for Banville: I'd rather read some genuine, medicore memoir about the loss of a loved one than this overcrafted exercise in writing.  That is what it feels like: an exercise.ng.  That is what it feels like: an exercise.
B000025SJ8|4.0|Great album.  Although I do like to attribute Mr. Vikernes' screams to his bursting of a hemorrhoid.  Just think about that and you'll laugh every time.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|After years of only being able to get the bogus remixed and re-recorded versions of the first 6 ZZ records, Rhino has finally begun issuing the Top back catalog (Tres Hombres and Fandango so far) faithfully restoring the original mixes of these classic records. The fact that these fine records were altered to begin with is a complete travesty. I had to resort to burning the original vinyl as CDs because of the previous butchery and doctoring of these vintage 70's recordings. But now the original mixes are finally available and they sound incredible. Tres Hombres has one of the best mixes of a hard rock album from the early 70's anyway, and to hear it in remastered digital form is an almost religious experience. Fandango sounds just as good, with a little more top end to the recording. I hope Rhino doesn't delay releasing the other 4 albums along with Deguello in original mix, remastered form. I can't wait to hear them. So if you are considering buying any of the first 7 ZZ Top CD's, only buy the 2006 remastered, original mix version of Tres Hombres and Fandango, and wait until the others get released in the same format. You'll be glad you waited and saved your money, I can't emphasize enough how terrible the previous releases of these CD's sounded.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Compelling, thilling, original. There are just not enough words to describe the sheer genius of this movie and it's first time directors/writers. If you ask me this is one good directorial debut for these guys.<br /><br />It all starts when this little boy starts having this so-called blackouts. After the confusing lapse in time, we are brought back to a pivital event that changes his life. We, in the audience know exactly what happens after each blackout, which sometimes are very disturbing given the innuendo that comes with it. But, after getting over his blackouts and documenting his condition, he finds that he is able to rewind back in time and change the life-altering events. But even good deciscions make the worst outcomes. Throughout the movie he is forced to go back each time to change the chain of events which he set in motion. Not only is this a movie with heart, consequences and redemption but it is just a really good change of pace. It does something different. It does something original. And that you can remember for good and take to the bank. Add this mobvie to your collection and you won't regret it. See the theatrical version first if you are getting the dvd. I personally think that that one is the best version.
B000002KJM|1.0|As part of an attempt to capitalize on the success of their Eliminator sound, ZZ Top decided to go back into the studio and remix and also re-record parts of their first 6 albums thinking it would make them more money and entice fans of their newer sound to go back and buy their earlier records. Well guess what, in the process their older fans who were used to the original versions on the old cassettes and albums were shocked when they listened to any of these first generation CD releases. They heard bogus reverbed drums, and entire sections of both music and vocals re-recorded. Talk about tarnishing the legacy of a great band's output. Well someone finally wised up and now at least Tres Hombres and Fandango are now available in original mix, remastered form. So stay away from this trash and wait for the entire back catalog to be released in it's original mix, remastered form on CD.

B000002KKK|4.0|For reasons unknown, after completely butchering the CD releases of their previous 6 albums by remixing and re-recording, ZZ Top saw fit to leave this one lone album and an early Greatest Hits collection alone in it's original form. It's not remastered but at least you can hear the album as it sounded when it was first released on vinyl. So it's a safe buy, but since Tres Hombres and Fandango are now finally available in original mix, remastered form, I would wait for this one to be re-released.

0688156819|5.0|The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories is a collection of 23 macabre poems about children that are quite a bit different from the average schoolboy or girl. It features characters like Anchor Baby, Stain Boy, The Girl With Many Eyes and of course Oyster boy. All poems are nicely illustrated by drawings in a style so typical to Tim Burton.<br /><br />You will not stumble upon a lot of disagreement if you state that Tim Burton is a creative genius. Again he proves his unbound talent in this little gem of a book. He takes the reader on an odd trip through his twisted world to show the most wonderful dark abominations. With only a few lines of poetry he succeeds in generating a deep feeling of compassion with each of those strange creatures, but subsequently and without exception ends the poem with a sick, but hilarious twist. Many times I literally had to laugh out loud just because of yet another case of macabre and instant death. Yeah, that is exactly what Burton does to a peace-loving guy like me.<br /><br />The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories is a book that you will finish in less than an hour, but will treasure forever.
0380789035|5.0|This is my first Gaiman book so I can't compare it to his other works. After I read this book I ran out and bought 3 more of his books, that is how much I enjoyed it. I don't think you should read alot about this book before you read it because it is so unique that describing the premise is even a bit of a spoiler. All I will say is that if you are interested in myth and folklore then you will love it and if you are not you will be by the end of the book.<br /><br />It is fresh and it tickled all of my interests. GO GET A COPY!!!
B000000W5L|2.0|I never could get all the praise and acclaim of this Stones album, and believe me, I tried because The Rolling Stones are one of two best and strongest rock bands ever in my opinion, the other being The Who. The Stones remain the best, not just because their career has spanned over 40 years, but because of the body of work they produced within those 40 years. It's over all quality and quanity with The Rolling Stones as a band, however \\"Exile On Main Street\\" is an example of quality vs. quantity. There are 18 songs here, making it a double album when it was release in 1972. So, they do have quantity here, but as for quality, \\"Exile\\" is definitely lacking. Far and away the best song on the entire album is \\"Rocks Off\\", one of their best songs. From the opening to the closing, \\"Rocks Off\\" really delivers the promise of a great album, it being the opening track. It's followed by an okay rocker \\"Rip This Joint\\", and at this point, it's still looking like it would be another great Stones album. As we move further, it just loses it's touch. The songs start to drag and are not memorable or strong, though they were not awful either. There are a few really good songs scattered about such as \\"Happy\\", \\"Tumblin' Dice\\", and \\"Shine A Light\\", but sadly that is all for me. Their two previous albums \\"Let It Bleed (1969)\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers (1971)\\" are their best albums because they deliver great and powerful songs all the way through, so the promise to deliver on \\"Exile\\" was even greater when it came out, but it just did not cut it for me as a whole. It did somehow cut it for many others. I still own this album for the sake of having the 'off the album' songs, \\"Rocks Off\\", \\"Happy\\", and \\"Shine A Light\\", but I never play the album as a whole.
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|David Hurwitz of \\"Classics Today\\"  says it all and in spades. I had never heard of Gary Bertini until I read his review of this 11 CD gem of a set. Mahler has never been more beautifully and brilliantly conducted. The music line of Mahler's often very difficult musical phrasing in Bertini's hands flows seamlessly without distortion, fractures in the musical flow, or exaggeration of ego bombast. The big moments ring with thrilling richness and soul moving exaltation.  I trusted Hurwitz in his review of the EMI recording of the Kempe Strauss complete orchestral works and that was a trust well rewarded and the same here. I think one of Bertini's many achievements in what I have heard so far  [discs just arrived today] are his innate resistance to be bombastic, banal and overblown.  The final movement of the 3rd  is as good as it gets; in the same category as Bernstein's 3rd on DDG but Bertini's advantage is an even greater subtlety. The movement just ended and you have to experience it, no matter whose cycle you may prefer. The 2nd with Quivar and Laki [the latter totally unknown to me] are extraordinarily stunning in sound and interpretation. Quivar's entrance \\"O Roschen rot\\" is gripping and her \\"O Glaube, mein Herz..\\"  hits an inner chord that even Ludwig doesn't surpass. And Ludwig grips your soul on the Mehta recording. The closing chorus and orchestra with Bertini end in a glory as if from another universe. The adagietto of the 5th is equal of any other recording I've heard if not superior. The peace and gentleness are perfection.  I think Bertini is very under-appreciated. The attention to detail is unbelievably beautiful, hearing instruments I have not heard on other recording. Hurwitz also praises the brass and they are outstanding. Conductor and the Cologne Radio symphony  are beyond reproach.  At the price, not to have this set is to deny yourself one of the eighth wonders of music. None of the over-stressed angst that many conductors of mahler's symphonies love to overwork.  Too bad Bertini cannot personally experience the attention and appreciation of this his outstanding achievement. I hope the musicians of the Cologne Radio symphony will revel in their outstanding achievement. And so it goes... kudos to EMI. The 1st is flowing through my headphones and seems to be  another glory of this set.  Buy! Buy!
B00005JNQS|4.0|I rented this movie at first for my 4-year old son.  He totally loves it and I went out and bought it for him.  <br /> <br />While some humor is more for an adult oriented, it still is a fun film for the kids.  My son laughs, giggles, and can't wait to point out funny scenes to us.  For days, he can talks about Rodney Copperbottom and Bender.   <br /> <br />Watching it multiple times, isn't a chore at all.
B000E1ZBH2|4.0|This movie does not stick perfectly to the book. It is more like Pride and Prejudice as our imagination might see if someone was telling it to us. Or like the scenes we've all changed in our minds eye to how we would like them to look, or scenes we've added. Many things are changed slightly. Characters personalities, with the exception of Lizzie and Darcy, are more what you would expect to find in real life. Mrs. Bennet claims more of our sympthy. Mr. Bennet seems more of an eccentric old man who loves his family but greatly values peace. Everyone else does not seems so whole bad or good, and I've never felt so bad for Darcy from the book or any movie.  <br />It's a short. Only two hours and nine minutes. It seems a little rushed at first, but everytime you watch it seems less so. It only gets four star because of this. The time also made it hard for the characters to really be delved into, but still very nice movie.
B00005JMAH|3.0|If you are a Harry Potter fan and for some reason haven't already purchased this film, do.  It does have a few great scenes, the actors all shine in spite of the bizarre directing, and it is Harry Potter.  But be prepared for disappointment.  There is a lot of wasted screen time with the willow tree (which this director put in a completely different location), as well as wasted time on some inane and pointless talking heads that he wrote into the script (presumably for comic relief, but to most adults they will just come off as extremely annoying).  Most of the dialogue is good, though I found the scene with Sirius and Lupin (when Lupin turns into a werewolf) nauseatingly overdone.  There are also giant plot holes, including the origin of the Map, which is not only extremely important, but also very obvious even to those who have never read the book.  Lupin tells Harry \\"yes, I know it's a map.\\"  That is all.  No explanation, no back story, nothing.  Harry's patronus appears at one point as the Stag, but they never explain why or even mention it.  The dementors, on the other hand, are portrayed in a different manner than the book; however, it works well.  Thankfully, there is a new director for the 4th film, and it was much much better.
B000002BHE|5.0|Celine Dion's Falling Into You is still wonderful pop!  It really set the tone for the adult contemporary pop scene that people like Rob Thomas, Kimberly Locke and other artists currently are in now.  Very gorgeous numbers especially Falling Into You, the emotional Fly, the bombast of It's All Coming Back to Me Now and the pretty Because You Loved Me. But Celine changes it up and has upbeat tunes in Declaration of Love, River Deep, Mountain High (powerful) and the funky Make You Happy. This album's heavy on ballads, but Celine pulls it off on every number and shows strong vocal range! I still think it's a far better improvement than that boring 1992 album and the solid 1993 effort I heard from her. This point, she knew how to assemble her albums right and knew what she wanted out of her pop sound. Her '97 album is her best, but this comes a close second!
B000E0OBK6|5.0|Anticipation was high for Jarhead, the cinematic adaptation of Anthony Swifford's book of the same name about his experiences as a U.S. foot soldier in the first Persian Gulf War. The reaction to the movie was underwhelming to say the least as critics savaged it and audiences stayed away. Something was definitely in the air as the film also failed to pick up any nominations or awards at any of the important ceremonies (Golden Globes, Oscars, et al). Was the film really that bad or had it just been marketed wrong? Or, was it simply the victim of our current political climate?<br /><br />Jarhead is a film filled with striking images captured wonderfully by director of photography Roger Deakins. For example, Swofford and his platoon come across oil wells burning out of control, oil raining down on them. At night, they continue to burn providing the only light, and coupled with downpour of oil, looks like some kind of nightmarish vision of hell.<br /><br />Critics complained that nothing happened in the movie but wasn't that the point? The first Gulf War was typified by highly trained soldiers ready to kill who, for the most part, did nothing because it was predominantly a conflict fought in the air by extensive bombing that ended the war as quickly as it did. Jarhead encapsulates this notion well in a scene where Swoff and Troy are ordered to sniper two high ranking Iraqi officers and at the penultimate moment when they are given the go-ahead to kill they are ordered to stand down so that an air strike can come in and literally steal their thunder. This scene pretty much sums up the experience for a lot of soldiers over there.<br /><br />Sure, there are the unavoidable comparisons to the boot camp sequences in Full Metal Jacket to the ones in Jarhead but so what? No film lives in a vacuum and those scenes are only a small part of the movie and it soon settles into its own rhythm. The film that Jarhead most lives under the shadow of is Three Kings with its mixture of biting satire and horrific imagery of the madness of war, except that Jarhead ends where Three Kings begins. This is a film about humanity (or, rather the loss of it) and not an epic battle of good vs. evil that perhaps people were expecting. Jarhead is purposely anti-climatic. We won the war but what did we do to win it and why? And more importantly, what were we doing there? By that extension, we should also be asking the same questions about its sequel - one that we are still fighting and paying for.<br /><br />\\"Swoff's Fantasies\\" feature four deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Sam Mendes and editor Walter Murch. This is footage of Swofford's inner, fantasy life that was shown briefly in the actual movie but more was actually shot (and even more figured in the book).<br /><br />\\"News Interviews in Full\\" features more footage of Swoff and his platoon being interviewed by the media with optional commentary by Mendes and Murch. The director mentions that he let the actors adlib their answers to the pre-arranged questions.<br /><br />Also included are 11 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Mendes and Murch. Of note is a scene with Sam Rockwell who plays Swoff's uncle and is in the Marines. Mendes and Murch do an excellent job of explaining why this footage was cut and are candid in what stuff just didn't work.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Mendes who didn't want to overthink the camerawork or go for the meticulously staged compositions as he did with his previous movies and instead opted for a looser look with extensive hand-held camerawork. This is a very strong track as he defends his choices and tells all kinds of good anecdotes.<br /><br />There is another commentary track by screenwriter William Broyles, Jr. and author Anthony Swofford. Broyles served in the Vietnam War and so these two war veterans talk with absolute authority about the authenticity of this movie. It's great to listen to Broyles and Swofford - two men who've been through what we are watching.<br /><br />On the Collector's Edition version are included three documentaries.<br /><br />First up, is the \\"Jarhead Diaries.\\" Mendes provides an introduction where he states his distaste of electronic press kits (finally!) and so he had a documentary crew film more peripheral stuff and gave the actors their own cameras to shoot whatever they wanted. The actors are refreshingly candid about their feelings making this movie as they are going through the actual experience.<br /><br />\\"Semper Fi\\" takes a look at four Marines who came home from the First Gulf War and from the current one. Anthony Swofford interviews these guys and has them talk about what their experiences were like over there and what their life is like now. Because he is also a veteran, he is able to get them to open up a bit. These are pretty sobering accounts as we listen to how hard it is for them to just turn off their combat training once they come back home.<br /><br />Finally, there is \\"Background,\\" a documentary about the extras who played anonymous Marines in the background of scenes. is a fascinating snapshot of their experiences.version are included three documentaries.

B000002C25|5.0|Oasis' 1997 album still sounds great.  I still like the adventurous Don't Go Away. I feel like I'm on some quiet country side in Oklahoma hearing this song. But recently, I heard the very addictive All Around the World in an AT&T commercial.  It makes me wants to dance to it every time it comes on. It makes this album more accessible now.
6304981635|4.0|I know Bolo isn't one of the best screen fighters ever, but there is no way that he should be gettin whooped up on by the cop from the freddy movie.  With some great performances by abou 10 great fighters or so and a couple of bruce against the world fights, this is you classic case of a classic movie.  The end fight could have been better, but a great movie overall.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Awesome record. I was skeptical at first but one great band was formed from two great bands.<br /><br />1.Cochise- Incredibly fast-paced. Cornell's vocals are outstanding. Reminds me of RATM's Guerrilla Radio. 10/10<br /><br />2.Show Me How to Live- Another great song. I love how Cornell screams the chorus. 9/10<br /><br />3. Gasoline- More of a Soundgarden song. It's pretty heavy. 8/10<br /><br />4.What You Are- Love this song. Didn't like it at first, but I like the music during the verses. 8/10<br /><br />5.Like a Stone- Audioslave's best ballad. The guitar solo is one of the best I've heard. 10/10<br /><br />6.Set It Off- Cornell goes more poliical here. The song is still cool and I love it when Cornell screams the F-word. 9/10<br /><br />7.Shadow on the Sun- Didn't like it at first listen until I heard it from the guitar solo- on. Now I like the whole song. 9/10<br /><br />8.I Am the Highway- Chorus is very catchy and is altogether a great ballad. 9/10<br /><br />9.Exploder- Cool riffing and is fast-paced. 8/10<br /><br />10.Hypnotize- Brad Wilk's best drumming here. Turns a so-so song into a good one. 8/10<br /><br />11.Bring Em Back Alive- Another heavy song but still catchy. 8/10<br /><br />12.Light My Way- I love the chorus. 8/10<br /><br />13.Getaway Car- Ehh...  Can't get into this song. 3/10<br /><br />14.The Last Remaining Light- I actually enjoy this song. Sounds like a lounge song. 7/10
B00003CXGG|3.0|now certainly all the action kept me more entertained than unleashed did, but the long fight scenes were just better in unleashed.  Overall I would givem the same rating, but unleashed gets the edge.  For a movie that should have been cut by about 10 min, still entertaining.  This certainly kicks the ass of the transpoter movies.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Out of Exile is more consistent than the first album. Cornell's voice seems to have gotten clearer.  <br /> <br />1.Your Time Has Come- Best Audioslave song. Great riff with anti-war lyrics and a great guitar solo from Morello. 10/10 <br />2.Out of Exile- Ho-Hum beginning but actually turns into a good song. Very catchy chorus. 8/10 <br />3.Be Yourself- The Like a Stone of this album except more upbeat. Another great single. 9/10 <br />4.Doesn't Remind Me- Great song. Very upbeat and catchy, with a memorable guitar solo. Wish it won that Grammy. 10/10 <br />5.Drown Me Slowly- This reminds me of Soundgarden's Ty Cobb. Very fast-paced and cool song. 8/10 <br />6.Heaven's Dead- Great blusey ballad with good vocals from Cornell. 8/10 <br />7.The Worm- The \\"Black Dog\\" of the album. Surprised Audioslave didn't release it into a single. 9/10 <br />8.Man or Animal- I like this song. I especially love how Cornell sings the verses. The solo isn't as good,however. 8/10 <br />9.Yesterday to Tomorrow- This song has grown on me. I love Morello's solo. 8/10 <br />10.Dandelion- Surprised to hear a pop song at first but it is also surprisingly great. 9/10 <br />11.#1 Zero- I think this song sounds cool. Kind of like a lounge song. 8/10 <br />12.The Curse- Worst song on the album, but by no means BAD. 6/10
B00004R99F|5.0|I love this movie, I watch it with or without my kids. its so cute, it always puts me in a good mood!
B000002J09|5.0|ZOSO is Led Zeppelin. Every song here is a classic. <br />1.Black Dog- Coolest Zeppelin song. Second only to a little song called \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". 10/10 <br />2.Rock and Roll- Zeppelin did this song to prove to critics that they could write rock and roll songs still even though their third album was so folksy. They succeded. This song is also on the Cadillac commercials. 10/10 <br />3.The Battle of Evermore- Worst song but still good. This is based on the Lord of the Rings. I love Sandy Denny's vocals in the background. 8/10 <br />4.Stairway to Heaven- Best song of all-time. Period. I still crumble under Jimmy Page's god-like guitar solo. 10/10 <br />5.Misty Mountain Hop- Doesn't get the credit it deserves because of the other classics. Another reference to The Lord of the Rings here. 9/10 <br />6.Four Sticks- I love the guitar riff and Plant's vocals. Another underrated song. 9/10 <br />7.Going to California- Zeppelin's best folk song. Absolutely mezmorizing. 10/10 <br />8.When the Levee Breaks- This is my self-proclaimed theme song. The music is just so DARN COOL!! Zeppelin's darkest song besides No Quarter. 10/10
B00005JOFO|5.0|I'm not surprised that the Academy Awards didn't have the guts to give its Best Picture award to \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\" Back in 1967 it didn't have the guts to give it to \\"The Graduate\\" although Mike Nichols, who directed \\"The Graduate,\\" won the Oscar for Best Director. Sound familiar? Besides Ang Lee, the director of \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" winning the Best Director Oscar, a racially diverse movie called \\"In the Heat of the Night\\" won the Best Picture Oscar. History repeats itself.    It's too bad that the Academy Awards still haven't grown up or matured in any shape or form. People keep talking about how stuffy the English are. Well, I'll tell you this. At least England voted for a woman as their Prime Minister (Margaret Thatcher) unlike America. And at least England or BAFTA voted for \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" as the Best Picture unlike America. America may think it's open-minded, but it is actually the \\"stuffed shirt.\\"    I'm also not surprised that the Academy Awards didn't have the guts to give the Best Foreign Language Picture award to \\"Paradise Now.\\"
B0000027RL|5.0|CLASSIC! Best album of the 90s. <br />1.Once- I love the opening and the song is really fast-paced. 9/10 <br />2.Even Flow- I prefer the Rearviewmirror version better but incredibly cool. Great working-out song. 10/10 <br />3.Alive- PJ's best song. The chorus is great and the guitar solo is absolutely fantastic. 10/10 <br />4.Why Go- Cool fast-paced break between the epics Alive and Black. 8/10 <br />5.Black- Pearl Jam's most emotional song. Best vocals I've heard. 10/10 <br />6.Jeremy- The song that got PJ famous(especially on MTV). Classic story of a young boy's life cut short. Very uplifting. 10/10 <br />7.Oceans- Worst song here but I'll never skip over it. 7/10 <br />8.Porch- PJ's most underrated song. Love Vedder's vocals. 9/10 <br />9.Garden- Cool song to listen to at night. Very cool. 8/10 <br />10.Deep- I love Vedder's vocals on the verses. 9/10 <br />11.Release- Very emotional ballad. 9/10 <br />12.Master/Slave- Not a track per se, but it occurs after Release and serves as the beginning to Once. Lots of weird sounds(which would come eminent on their later albums). 6/10 <br />
B00000JSJC|5.0|Released in 1995 this film imagines a distant future of 1999 where gas is over $2.oo a gallon(imagine that)and people want to experience the reality of other people's lives without leaving their own homes.The SQUID technology that allows characters to record what they see and sell it to others(demonstrated in the terrific P.O.V. opening)is used by a killer to record his brutal murders.The responsability to find the killer falls into the lap of washed up cop now tech pimp Ralph Fiennes.Hopelessly obsessed with his ex-girlfriend and his recorded memories of her it's up to a tough limo driver Angela Bassett to help him pull it together.Predating our obsession with reality T.V. by years Strange Days is amazing on many different levels.It was a failure on it's initial release due to the lack of big box office stars.Fortunately what director Kathryn Bigelow did was get people who were right for the part.Instead of being a macho hero Fiennes is emotionally wounded yet charismatic.Instead of being just another pretty face to kick butt Angela Bassett is also the film's emotional anchor.At the time this one of the biggest movies ever to be directed by a woman and it's clearly a labor of love.From the diverse music selection from Deep Forest to versions of PJ Harvey songs to the fact that it's more character based than full of mindless action and has some very clever camerawork you tell she put a lot of thought into creating this film.The New Year's Eve climax is guaranteed to get your blood boiling and is one of the most dramatic endings ever staged.Filmed almost entirely at night in a neon lit world of clubs it's as visually impressive today as it was 10 years ago.If you've never seen this movie you need to check it out...it's one of the best forgotten movies of the 90's.
B000BT97AO|4.0|Some film rely on their special effects like a crutch(like the recent dreadful Ultraviolet)that make you think \\"Yes you have the technology now why don't you do something orginal with it?\\"Remember movies that were creative and smart and had great effects(Brazil is a classic example)?Mirrormask is the first movie of the 21st century to have all those elements.Written by the talented creator of the Sandman comic series Neil Gaiman and with vivid effects by the Jim Henson Company Mirrormask is the perfect fusion of technology and imagination.Like most of Gaiman's work there isn't really a conventional point A - point B plot but the gist of it is a girl finds herself stuck a Dreamworld where she must find the location of the Mirrormask before darkness consumes the land.Along the way she encounters many strange facinating creatures and magical floating books(and some odd critters whose diet consists of eating those books).Stephanie Leonidas is great as the girl and isn't as blandly sweet as most child stars.Gaiman's often witty script gives her a lot of spunk.The use of lighting and beautiful design by director Dave McKean help create a magical environment for her journey.You may have to see it twice to \\"get\\" everything as there are many complex mysterious elements but it's more worth it to see this twice than to see most movies once.An enchanting accomplishment.
B00009L1TA|3.0|Sometimes I have a really difficult time distinguishing if I ask too much from media or if I should just go with the flow.  Most of those moments come after viewing such movies as this, where when it comes down to the craft-level of the film, there's nothing technically wrong with it, but the fact that it's utterly lacking in any sort of \\"reason to be\\" or theme just makes me feel I wasted my time.<br /><br />A troupe of rangers-in-training and a legendary sergeant are in the midst of a hurricane in the Panama Canal when something goes awry.  We don't know what it is at first, but when a surveiling helicoptor notices one of the trainees shooting another, an investigation is started to find out what exactly is going amiss.<br /><br />The movie itself is filled with people who have shown their ability to perform but don't necessarily guarantee a good performance.  Samuel L. Jackson plays one of his typecast roles.  John Travolta plays one of his typecast roles (Oh, and having them together in this movie doesn't make it a Pulp Fiction, I can tell you that).  Even Connie Nielson, who I like a lot, does her role and doesn't add to it.<br /><br />Now the point of the movie is something like the point of a Shyamalan movie: let's make a twist and see how good we are at surprising the audience.  Now the thing about a Shyamalan movie is, even though his twists are getting rather ridiculous and even though they begin to feel a bit condescending, there's still a point to them.  A Shyamalan film has a theme, about fate, about human nature, about death, etc.  This film has twists because it wants to surprise.  However, to an audience that is used to having twists as a rather generic method of plot development, that leaves a lot to be desired.  Especially when such twists happen after a milieu of twists, so that by the time the movie ends you don't really care about any of the characters anymore because they've shedded so many identities that you're forced to believe they don't actually have one.<br /><br />So we have an action film, by John McTiernan, who has already proven himself to be brilliant (c'mon, Die Hard...); we have performers who've already proven their worth; and we have a script that works out in its own way.  Yet none of it really matters.  And so even though it's an okay movie, it's still a waste of time.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBon't actually have one. <br /> <br />So we have an action film, by John McTiernan, who has already proven himself to be brilliant (c'mon, Die Hard...); we have performers who've already proven their worth; and we have a script that works out in its own way.

1559408855|5.0|This movie is simply the most disturbing movie ever made. I heard about it in Premier Magazine as they had the 20 most disturbing movies of all time. But I knew nothing about it. I watched it once. I will never watch it again. This is not an exageration. It is something I do not want experience again.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is a very personal and intimate album by Mr David Gilmour. Of course there is a feeling and some atmospheres of the Floyd band. This was some time ago, one can never cut off his roots and Mr Gilmour has changed since then and evolved to make some very different, intimate and loving music. I enjoy very much the similar sound of Pink Floyd here and there but with more restraint, sparse and space between his notes. Of course he could have hired a stream of musicians, added layers of sound and knock your socks off. He chose to do it differently, the more you listen the more its magnificent. This is simply music at its best maybe progressive rock for some but as we used to say, its underground music.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Okay, maybe I'm being a little critical there. At this point in the show's run, with Rory having one year of college under her belt and witnessing an undeniable rift in the mother/daughter dynamic in Season 4, I think it was important to add more than a twinge of humanity to Rory's character in this pivotal Season 5.     Season 4 was clearly not Gilmore Girls' best year, perhaps mostly because the relationship between mother and daughter had to undergo a significant change with the separation caused by Rory's entrance into college. As all avid fans know, Rory maintained her squeaky-clean, sweet little girl next door image throughout that season, right up to the season finale....and then she fell flat on her face with a decision that stunned everyone. In Season 5, we get to bear witness to her reaction to her big mistake (a reaction that you might not expect from her), and she goes back for her second year at Yale as a much more human college kid. She parties more, breaks out of her shell, and truly separates from that sweet and youthful image with a choice in the season finale that, just like the 4th season finale, left all viewers speechless (maybe even more so this time around). Now, of course, in the current Season 6, Rory is most definitely a very different person than she was portrayed as the first four years of the show, and although it is disappointing to many Rory fans, it is a dramatic shift in character that clearly began its unwinding in this Season 5.     A renaissance of a year for Rory Gilmore, indeed....but let's not forget Lorelai, either. Not only does she finally get her dream inn, the Dragonfly, underway with a highly successful test run and a booming first year of business, but she gets something else that's pretty major. Indications of the chemistry and concealed love between Luke and Lorelai have been evident to the naked eye since the pilot episode of Season 1, and now we FINALLY get to see this formulate into a romantic relationship. The strength of this season lies arguably in the bond that these two share. It's something that fans have wanted for a very long time, and with the developments occurring in Season 6, it appears that this couple will make for some very high quality television.    Season 5 is certainly a season to purchase if you are a big fan of the show. A strong metamorphosis takes place with the characters as they settle into their changes in distance and personal relationships, the show becomes something far different from what we enjoyed in the first few seasons and truly becomes respectable and powerful in its own right.
B0000262QW|4.0|This album may not be for everyone, but it is a great album.  The best song on it is \\"La Fiesta.\\"  The synthesized sounds may take a little getting used to, but the music is genuine and creative.  Corea blurs the line between improviser and composer.  The side men/women really compliment Corea's ideas in a very coherent way.  Joe Farrell is a joy to listen to on sax and flute.  If you like this album, you may also like RTF's \\"light as a feather,\\" as well as \\"the leprechan,\\" \\"my spanish heart,\\" and \\"the mad hatter,\\" by Corea.
B00005ASHM|5.0|It sounds silly to say this, but the Beach Boys really did change my life...I'm not sure when exactly I discovered that they were more than the fun songs I heard on the oldies station when I drove somewhere with my parents.   <br />      But, reading an editorial in my local newspaper one day, I noticed they mentioned that Brian Wilson was a musical genius.  This greatly intrigued me, and I just had to discover who this Brian Wilson guy was...then I continued reading and found that he was the leader of the very familiar band, The Beach Boys.  I immediately found the one Beach Boys c.d. that my dad had and put it on, this time listening deeper than I had ever before listened to The Beach Boys.  I found that whoever wrote the newspaper editorial was correct...Brian Wilson was a musical genius...amazing vocal harmonies...outstanding instrumental use...a different and creative sound...and simply great songwriting!   <br />       This epiphany occurred about two years ago, and has left me obsessed with Brian Wilson ever since...which is no easy thing to say when you're eighteen years old and everyone else around you is listening to Fall Out Boy and The All American Rejects...and I actually really like both of those bands...they're fun to listen to and I like them, but I can admit that it's not great music.  And sometimes, when I'm listening to bands like them, I wish that bands did it the way they used to...more about the music and less about the image.  Nowadays, it seems like vocals is not a big part of music...because, in most current bands, the drummers and guitarists are pretty good and the singers sound like crap...I miss hearing good voices...such as the sweet soaring sound of Brian Wilson's falsetto, and the sounds of other harmonic groups, such as The Mamas and the Papas...The Association...The Grass Roots...Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young...the Beatles.        <br />       Anyway, I'm well aware that I am very off-track here...I'm supposed to be talking about how awesome Pet Sounds is, not how I feel about every musical group ever!  So, Pet Sounds...what can I say that hasn't already been said?  It's an amazing album...I don't feel that any words can do it justice.     <br />       I've read a few reviews on this album that state that people just like Pet Sounds and say it's the best album of all time because that's what they've heard the \\"intellectuals\\" say.  Ummm...no.  I could really care less what these alleged \\"intellectuals\\" have to say...I feel that Pet Sounds is the greatest album of all time because listening to it makes me feel indescribably happy...that's all...it soothes me...takes my problems away...reassures me that everything's going to be okay...that's how I know that it's the greates album of all time.  It may not be some people's kind of music, but that's fine...everyone has their own opinions...but if you're eighteen and you love The Beach Boys just as much as I do, even though none of your friends and peers can understand why, don't worry...you're not alone...you're in a very elite club full of the most awesome people on earth...just kidding...but honestly...be reassured because there are a few others out there.
0060194995|5.0|Harper Lee writes this book and the way she wrote this book was real nice. The setting of this book happened around the 1930's when blacks are still discriminated. <br />This book starts with a girl name Scout telling her story about her summer days in a small town called Maycomb. She acted more like a boy but the way she acts she is more mature compare to the kids with the same age. So this story she tells has two important parts, the frightened neighbor that live beside them, which later save her at the end and the rape case. The rape case in my opinion was the most exciting part of the story. When Scouts father defends for the black in the rape case. At that time, when a white is helping a black, it would be awkward. <br />Overall this book really a must read book not because its a classic but it really tells you what happened during the south's at that time. <br />
B0000AYJXR|5.0|I was one of the Lucky ones I got to grow up and enjoy Bugs and his pals every Saturday morning and always enjoyed his very funny antics and he was my favorite toon. I also was lucky in regards to have been at the right age to just be getting in to Basketball and enjoying it when in 1984 the world was introduced to the greatest player of all time Michael Jordan!!! What do you get when you put the best with the best? You get one amazing and one very funny family friendly film that is one of the best live animation movie I have evr saw!!!
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Just when you think the time has passed for the material girl she makes a comeback.Her first comeback was Ray of Light.Then recently people thought she was washed up after the disappointing sales of American Life.This year she proves everyone wrong again with American Life and the addictive hit Hung Up which try as you might you can't get it out of your head.With all the songs flowing into each other like a trance cd Confessions on a Dance Floor is a terrific high energy party cd.Supported by great beats there are some surprisingly personal (but still entertaining songs) like How High and the terrific attitude filled final song Like It Or Not.As on all CDs some songs are more memorable than others and there no songs here destined to become classics in a Like A Prayer way but Confessions on a Dance Floor proves after all these years Madonna can still teach all those kiddies a thing or two about dance/pop music.Slick and a lot of fun!
6304698623|5.0|This movie is probably the reason I spent so much time trying to catch my dolls come to life when I left the room as a child. Looking back, there's a lot to be said about the story itself... Brilliant and thought-provoking.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Based on the real life experiences of Anthony Swofford during Operation Desert Storm Jarhead shows the impact of war on troops before the fighting even starts.More Full Metal Jacket than Saving Private Ryan don't expect epic battle scenes.Do however expect strong performances especially from lead Jake Gyllenhaal who gives an intense portrayal of a man cracking under pressure. The bulk of the movie concerns thousands of troops pumped up for action in the desert waiting for combat to begin.Soon with nothing to do heat and boredom take their toll on them.The movie avoids any political statements and instead effectively shows that our troops must endure more hardships than enemy fire.Vividly directed by Sam Mendes with often a great sense of dark humor and irony.(There's a great scene that contrasts travel in Apocalypse Now with travel in modern warfare).Not really a \\"war\\" picture but more of a riveting psychological drama and even though it's short on action it's an extremely good film.
B000AMJDHY|3.0|Here's the thing, some of you seem very confused. This is not punk rock, so you punks can just stop being so upset about it because it's not poisoning your precious punk. It may be emo, but at this point, emo is so sub-genre'd that I would stop using the term because it's become meaningless. And the definition of poser would be someone who says they are hard (i.e. saying you like the sex pistols, who btw were a corporate construction like a boy band) but in reality don't like punk or rap or whatever the case may be, and tend to attack other people's hardness. Everyone on here getting their panties in a bunch is more likely to be a poser than the teenyboppers listening to this harmless dance rock. I am now checking the \\"I am over the age of 13\\" box; I suggest you all try it.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|I begin this by letting you all know that I am not a typical System fan. My musical diet is basically all drawn from the indie, grunge, ska, and alternative genres. There are of course exceptions, System of a Down being one of them, which is why this review will probably be the opposite of the others on the page. <br />I was too young when the self-titled album came out to enjoy it. I was introduced to System of a Down through Toxicity, and fell in love with such standard radio fare as Chop Suey!, Deer Dance, ATWA, and the title namesake Toxicity (never liked Aerials much, though). Steal This Album, to me, was a statement more than a CD, and Mezmerize was good with a few more-mediocre exceptions. Hypnotize, however, is different. It's more angry, still politically charged, but more instrumentally creative... it stays away from falling into the \\"just like Rise Against\\" category by maintaining the ethnic feeling. That said, a song-by-song review: <br /> <br />Attack - 6/10. One of those songs that I wish I liked, but did not. It's more noise than music. Moreover, it's noise that doesn't bode well after the first ten times of hearing it. I appreciate the value of the song but I can't listen to it for too long. <br /> <br />Dreaming - 7/10. I really love the musical qualities of this song; Eastern influences appeal to me because they're somewhat rare in the music world. The structure in general, though, kinda sucks.  <br /> <br />Kill Rock & Roll - 8/10. Technically this should not be scored this high -- the lyrics aren't even as bad as people say they are, but the way they are arranged is. This song, with the right pattern, could have been better. However, there is something so addictive about the chorus, that I actually overlook the badness that is the screechy, sick-sounding-Daron verse. The harmonization is what makes this song listenable and worth the 8 -- it's just a struggle to get past the first thirty seconds of crap. <br /> <br />Hypnotize - 9/10. I like it. It became a single, meaning other people like it. Very obvious that it's System of a Down, good organization and thoughtful lyrics. I prefer this to the other anthem-track we know as BYOB. <br /> <br />Stealing Society - 9/10. If it wasn't for the ever-screeching Daron and the deep harmonics of Serj, this song would have not appealed and would not be worth a nine. It's very angry. But I like it anyway because, sometimes, anger can sound good. <br /> <br />Tentative - 10/10. REALLY strong song. This has a good standalone quality with just solid lyrics, the Armenian influence, and not too much shrillness. Daron's shrillness sometimes gets in the way of a good song, but not here. Of course, this song benefits from actually MEANING something. <br /> <br />U-Fig - 6/10. If I didn't like the quiet guitars, this song would've been fairly worthless to me... Serj often works as a screamer, but there's something kind of off about it to me. <br /> <br />Holy Mountains - 10/10. Awesome. Chilling, somehow. Serj does well. Part of what I like about the band is using explosiveness to offset and therefore spark appreciation for the quiet parts. This utilizes that capability. <br /> <br />Vicinity of Obscenity - ?/10. I cannot even describe my feelings about this song. It's just so weird. Really funny sex lyrics. Banana Banana Terracotta Pie? Smells like unproven innuendo. I've now convinced myself that the entire song is dirty. If you really think about it, this song destroys your eardrums, but you forget that because you're trying to figure out what the hell he's saying. I can't even rate it -- I just don't know how. Much like the token 'weird song' 'This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song'. <br /> <br />She's Like Heroin - 5/10. I just didn't like it. The message they wanted was good (like Psycho -- same drug-related crazy girl theme), but the way they wrote it was not. <br /> <br />Lonely Day - 10/10. Okay. The most surprising thing on here. When I heard this, I didn't know it was even System of a Down -- it just doesn't sound like them, at all. I have an ear for audial components and I kinda thought the background harmonizer was Serj, and.. it was. It is undeniabley the weirdest song on this CD, even more than the bananabananabananaterracottapie-ing of Vicinity, because it's so far from what they know how to do. I heard somewhere that this song is making fun of emo, but it's not a lighthearted song at all. Even with its relative eh-ness lyrically, it has the same feel that Mezmerize's Radio/Video had -- good interlude, good solo by Daron, great harmonies, and inoffensive singing by Daron (who I typically like less). The difference is that there is no scream-y offset the way Radio/Video had. There is absolutely no yelling in the entire song. By no means is it bad... it's my favorite on this CD, for its sheer difference and representation that System of a Down is not afraid to do stuff like this. <br /> <br />Soldier Side - 10/10. Heartfelt and strong. Like others have said, a great closer. Very good musically, but the lyrics are what make it a real song. <br /> <br /> <br />I have tons of respect for these guys, their music, and their work, and like many others I do not want to lump them in with any other genre. Their folk influences keep them from becoming standard politically-charged metal. <br />However, it is probably very strange that I would rate so many songs highly and then give the whole CD just three stars. I do this for two reasons. One, because nothing is spectacular on here. No matter how much I like Lonely Day or Soldier Side, when I think of System of a Down I will think of something older because those songs were stand-alone gems. Song quality sometimes does not determine the memorable factor. Two, because as a unit this CD is more than adequate -- it has a good sense of flow with creative touches added, and the style we associate with SOAD is the basis for the album -- but that doesn't cause the individual songs toinspire anything. As a whole, the album is very good, but individual songs kind of fall flat without the cohesiveness of the surrounding songs to support.  <br />I do like this CD. It's worth buying, listening to, etc. It does show progression. But after listening to it, it didn't stick with me because the individual quality is so dependent on the whole thing.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This movie has a captivating style and a great, consistent and sometimes even witty storyline. I didn't feel annoyed by the shaking screen during the car chase as opposed to what many reviewers did here. It made me feel I was there, and it felt very real. In the car chase scene you could feel the mass of each car in a way computer generated images can never make you feel. Very entertaining and thrilling and definitely one of the best movie I encountered in a year. <br />
B000002UAI|5.0|Beatles For Sale has to be one of the most overlooked albums in The Beatles catalog.  This is the record that shows Robert Freeman's fine portrait of four tired men who conquered the world, and just a year before, Freeman captured the same men as young fresh fellows in their boyish bohemian pose on the cover of With The Beatles.  While making Beatles For Sale, they went back in forth from the London recording studio to the concert stage in order to complete their tour obligations; No doubt it shows on the record.  Who could blame these four Liverpudlians for looking so tired?  Yes, this is the roots record, the crossroad record, and another step of the maturation of The Beatle sound.  For those familiar with the US albums released by Capitol, a few of the tracks on this record were scattered on Beatles '65 and Beatles VI. The re-mastered version of Beatles '65 can now be found on the Capitol box set, The Capitol Albums Vol. 1, which has eight tracks from Sale that has a better sound quality.<br /><br />The sounds of the past are heard on 14 of the tracks.  Members of the band were greatly influenced by the American rock and roll of the 1950s and the sounds that were hitting the airwaves circa 1964.  The record opens with John's composition about indiscretion, \\"No Reply\\".  But it is the songs that echo the Beatles' rock and roll heroes that resonate on most of the tracks, such as Chuck Berry's \\"Rock and Roll Music\\", the jangling twelve-string ric-o-sound is heard on the melodic Buddy Holly composition, \\"Words of Love\\", John and Paul do their Everly Brothers-like harmonies on \\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party\\", the Carl Perkins rockabilly meets Chet Atkins styles are heard from Ringo and George's \\"Honey Don't and \\"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby\\", concert favorite, \\"Medley:  Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey\\", and the unusual Hamburg staple, \\"Mr. Moonlight\\".  There is a tinge of folk music a la Bob Dylan on John's, \\"I'm A Loser\\".  Paul and John duet on \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\",  \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" sound like they could have been covered by The Byrds. John attempts to add his style of country and western twang-waltz rendering with the oddity, \\"Baby's In Black\\".  However, the highlight of the record is the sing-able and most memorable Beatles song, \\"Eight Days A Week\\" with its handclaps, foot stomping, and \\"have a good time\\" attitude.<br /><br />Beatles For Sale is the record before groundbreaking sounds began to emerge in 1965 on Help! and Rubber Soul.  The best way to hear how their sound and songwriting progressed is to hear each record in chronological order.  This particular record is recommended listening because one can distinctively hear a hint of their sound holding on to the past, but at the same time moving forward with their musical experimentation.Little Thing\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" sound like they could have been covered by The Byrds.

B000E6UK5K|2.0|I give ON AN ISLAND two stars for two reasons; one, the title track is actually very good.  Two, it's still David \\"f*ckin\\" Gilmour!    Pink Floyd has been my favorite band since I was a teenager and that's never going to change.  Respectively, David Gilmour has been my favorite guitarist and that's never going to change.  But I have to be brutal here.  David's an old man now, and his music and guitar power have gotten old with him.  And except for the title track, the album is dull, dull, DULL!    And I'm sorry, but unlike many other reviewers, I am not willing to accept his age as an excuse for the music.  I believe McCartney, Dylan, Clapton and Richards are all older than Gilmour and they've managed to hold onto their energy.  In fact, if you had been lucky enough to catch CREAM in concert in NYC, you would have been shocked to see the high-powered performance three men in their mid-to-late sixties were putting on stage.    Thankfully, I sampled the cd at a listening station before paying for it.  Save your money toward a David Gilmour concert ticket.  At least you'll presumably hear the old material and some classic Pink Floyd!
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I was expecting a David Gilmour album and I found it.  It's not as good as About Face but it is still great.  If your hoping to find some Floyd here I don't think you will be happy but if your a Gilmour fan then you owe it to yourself to get it.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Ok overall this works, seeing people tortured is horrific and this movie is very much that and is that's what horror is all about - for the final 30 minutes, that is.    The build up to this creepy movie is slow and steady, the usual basically - get the know the characters from the US through casual sex with strangers, before the torture chamber sequences!    It's graphic for a mainstream movie, but it could of went further and there is for sure more disturbing movies, for example an eye gouging scene - the most graphic gore in the movie - we seen before and better in Miike's \\"Audition\\", or Fulci's \\"Zombie\\"  with a spike or even in Bourke's \\"Last Exit\\" effort with a blunt spoon.       Huge improvement over the \\"Cabin Fever\\". It actually reminded more of \\"Saw\\" more than anything else.    The torture guy looked creepy, very like \\"Donald Rumsfeld\\" also in his mannerisms, if that was intentional - then that was a stroke of genius! LOL.    Overall worth watching -  hope for a nice un-tortured DVD!
B000000OU4|5.0|This album is musical, not weird like so many cuts on so many of his albums. If you like hard core jazz with unexpected changes that appeal to some, then don't buy this. But if you like songs that have some of the best melodies and palatable chord progressions there are, this album is unbeatable, in my opinion. His album Still Life is almost as good as this too, fyi. His other albums have too many weird songs mixed in on them. But when this guy wants to write a melody, he is unbeatable, and that's what he does here. I have listened to this CD back to back for weeks if not months at a time, with no other CDs in between times, believe it or not.
0884271536|3.0|I enjoyed his book \\"The Goal\\". This book takes too long to get to the point. I don't think it is as well written as the former. I believe the content is very good, but maybe I should have waited for the Reader's Digest version. I like a book that is fast paced.
B000CZ0Q5W|3.0|The first five songs on this CD are among the best songs by any artist on earth, in my opinion. The 6th is a Metheny-weirdo. (he has some of these) The 7th is quite good if you have the patience for it. The first song is likely my favorite song of all time. Be patient through it's two minute intro. Even that will grow on you. <br />I play guitar and I know that Metheny has a talent that very few others either have or at least use. He can play arhythmically. He also isn't overly fancy, which is a blessing. <br />He has another album that is this good also-We Live Here. These two albums are probably the best albums ever produced in jazz(or any other style), in my opinion. They are melodic, not hard core jazz. I'm a Zeppelin and Rush fan and I love 1/2 of Wes Montgomery. But these Metheny CDs I listen to back to back for weeks at a time with nothing else in between.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|This Cd is by far Rufus's best work. His finger skills shine as he covers the whole keyboard and and plays with major and minor scales. His unique voice accompanies the melodies beautifully, but its finished off with a raw sinister vocal style.<br /><br />you wont find a more unique album to pass an afternoon with.
B00005JOHI|3.0|I have to agree with at least one other reviewer on this site...I could hardly understand a word of what was said in the first 20 minutes or so of this film. Admittedly I saw it at the cinema so the producers may have had chance to do something about it for the DVD release...but short of reshooting the first few scenes with another actress in Knightley's role I can't see how they can. The main problem is Keira Knightley's unwillingness to open her mouth when she speaks. She has an awful habit of sticking out her chin and speaking most of her lines through clenched teeth - it's incomprehensible for the most part and almost had me walking out of the cinema (she was exactly the same in Love Actually). Thankfully for us all her case of near terminal lock-jaw seemed to clear after 20 minutes or so after which we were treated to overall a very good film.  <br /> <br />Not as good as the BBC version but worth a watch.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I made the mistake of paying two bucks to rent this. I don't know how anyone could give it more than 1 star, or how Knightly got an Oscar nomination. This was miserably miscast, misdirected, and poorly acted.  <br /> <br />The script follows the novel only loosely, omitting so much of the story that I doubt someone unfamiliar with P & P would even know what is going on. Instead of showing the Bennets as gentlepeople, this version has them living in a farmyard with a pig wandering into the house. The historical detail is a mess, too. This film has Darcy proposing to Elizabeth at dawn in a field with both of them in their pajamas.  <br /> <br />A real travesty of one of the finest novels in the English language.
B0006GAOBI|2.0|Before starting I want to get it clear that Donnie darko is a brilliant movie, one of my top 10 favourite. My low rating isn't due to the movie itself, but to the director's cut. <br /> I saw the movie's theatrical version a year ago or so. I loved it, all of it. The acting is great, the story is fantastic, the script is clever and brilliant and the movie gets you to think, not only about it's own meaning, but about everything else.It's a movie that leaves its print on you.  <br /> I couldnt wait to see the director's cut, most Director's cut's I had seen before where much better than the theatrical versions (like the butterfly effect for instance?. But with Donnie, I was terribly dissapointed. Many unnecesary changes had been made in the movie (like changing the music in the \\"burn to the ground\\" part, which was beautifull in the theatrical version), some strange scenes had been added which didnt suit the movie. Those extracts from \\"the philosophy of time travel don't fit in the movie at all,  the opening eye they had introduced between scenes is just odd... In my opinion the theatrical version is much better, and I think that with the succes the director  must either have done this to sell more or he has just got carried away with his idea and not done it properly. <br />  The worst thing in the DVD, however, is not the  movie itself, but the extras, they are the worse extra features I have seen in a DVD ever. The \\"documentary\\" where they show you the filming of some scene and  show you the guys looking for the right places to film is boring and badly done, the one about the Donnie Darko fans is quite useless too, it doesnt bring anything, but its better than the others. The \\"darkomentary\\" about the number one fan is just too much for me to handle, the guy is a complete moron, and he shows it all the way through the \\"darkomentary\\". I can't understand why Richard kelly got that number one fan thing going on, but he must have chosen the worst one he got. Its not even funny, its just sad. <br />  If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't buy the director's cut, if you have seen it the do it to your own risk, I am sorry I did, but its still interesting to see it. If you are like the number one fan then....poor you.
0783226845|5.0|I agree with the previous comments about this amazing film but the soundtrack has been unreviewed. The music (I have bought the CD) is USA itself, music to motor with. The tango is erotic on the screen and foot tapping on the CD. The orchestration is a masterpiece of rhythmic moods and tones. Al Pacino's genius is augmented by this soundtrack and I highly recommend the film and the CD.
B00000I8NC|5.0|This EP has more depth than most bands full LP's. The music is as incredible as anything they have done, and with a total run time of 28 minutes, i dont feel like it is not worth bringing around with me (as i do with most EP's containing a few songs). One thing that i feel about the music is that i feel it is actually more fast paced when it comes to the build up than most of their records, which could be a goodthing or a bad thing (depending on what you like about GY!BE). True that the political speaking is intense and in many ways resemblant of a James Nichols rant, but i feel that it is just as extreme as the samples they have used on previous records. They usually use rough sounding people for their backgrounds, but i also saw it more as satire. But all that aside, the music on this record is phenomenal and truely worth the purchase. So make yourself happy, and buy this work of beauty.
B000001EL3|5.0|Alright, I have recently gotten back involved and reclaimed my posistion in the kiss army after four years of absence. I have been a kiss fan my whole life but after the fairwell tour I lost my interest in the \\" Hottest band in the world\\", I am 19 to some that is young, but after a breakup with the women I loved for two years I had to find myself, it was a time for self exporation if you will! <br />I went searching for things in my life that had made me happy before I met her, and kiss among other things had popped up in my head, I had sold all of my albums and the only things i had left of kiss was all the posters magizines and movies that i had boxed away, I broke all of that stuff out and started really getting into it again, and I remember why they were my favorite band. <br />Ok, now that story has relevance i promise because once I was suited up to join the battle once again for the Kiss army, I went out and Destroyer was the first album I purchased again. <br /> <br />so how does this album rate, I gave it five stars becuase there are so many classics here, Beth, shout it out Loud, God of Thunder, Detroit Rock City, Flaming Youth, and King of the nighttime world, there are a few songs on here that I dont really like as much as others but they are still good, Do you love me, great expectations, sweet pain, these songs are good but they dont have the power that flaming youth or shout it out loud or god of thunder have, <br />so I will rate each song from 1-10 <br />1.detroit rock city- kiss classic 10 <br />2.King of the Night TIme world- nice song pretty hard 8 <br />3.God Of Thunder- this song is probably one of the best songs kiss ever made, its hard pounding gene does a good job vocally and the solo is decent 10 <br />4.Great Expectations- 5 this is where the album starts to go a little soft. <br />5.Flaming youth- 8 this is a great hard song, ace helped write this one and it kicks ass, <br />6.Sweet Pain- 6 soft but melodic I like it better then Great expectations. <br />7.Shout it out Loud- must I really say anything this is probably the third most known kiss song out there, its a rally song and it rocks and Ace destroys the competition with this solo. <br />8.Beth- Ok, so I have been bashing the soft songs it seems like but this is the exception this song is the most powerful kiss song, rankin with the likes of God gave rockn roll to you 2, and Rock n roll all night, it gets a 10 and its the only song peter sung on the whole album. <br />9. Do you love me- 8 a nice finish to the album soft but not bad its pretty slow but its ok, its a good song, <br />10. the bonus is pretty stupid I think bob ezrin just wanted to who knows what he was thinking, anyways, pick this up it your new to kiss or if you dont have it, its one of the best, most say its the best but thats false its one of the best, there is a special gun out there that is better then this one haha,
0140177396|5.0|When I first picked up this book I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.  I did the one thing you shouldn't do, I judged a book by its cover.  As soon as I started reading my mind was changed.  I felt attached to Lenny but I also felt George's pain for having to be with him at all times.  The book also teaches history.  It describes what it would be like to live like George and Lenny.  I have a strong attachment to this book because it was the first book I read that brought a tear to my eye.
B000002LA2|2.0|OK--I have to warn you--I am a huge Eric fan.  When I was in high school I bought my first Eric Album--a 45 which was \\"For Your Love\\" and have purchased every record and CD of his since.  Eric Clapton is God.  One of the smoothest most tastefull guitarists ever. <br /> <br />This album stinks.  It is overproduced pop garbage.  To me its like if Van Halen did a standards album.  I just never thought of Eric doing pop, and well, he pulled it off, but leave pop to the Babyface's or other slick musicians of this world to do.  Ugh. <br /> <br />There are simply no tastey licks, no screaming guitar solos, no inspiration, and no emotion.  Of all my Clapton albums, and I have got a ton, this is my least favorite.
B000002MNR|5.0|This CD consists of musical selections from the soundtracks of \\"Cal, Last Exit to Brooklyn, The Princess Bride,\\" and \\"Local Hero\\" by Mark Knopfler finger-picking rock guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, best known as the front man for Dire Straits.     \\"Cal\\" and \\"Local Hero\\" feature Celtic influenced music; \\"Princess Bride\\" is lilting and classical; \\"Last Exit\\" features melancholy violins.  The best known tune on the CD is the \\"Local Hero\\" theme, \\"Going Home,\\" which Knopfler used to play in his live shows.  The outstanding feature of the CD is Knopler's guitar playing which as always is complex and tuneful.      If the CD lacks anything it is majesty -- but none of these films was majestic, so Knopfler can be forgiven for not writing an ear-thumping \\"Lord of the Rings\\"-type theme. My wife calls a couple of the pieces drippy, but most are very good, a few beautiful, and all good, easy listening.     Smallchief
B0007PAMR4|1.0|First off let me say this.  I liked Herbert's book.  I generally appreciate David Lynch's movie-making efforts.  But this movie (extended edition or not) is a catastrophe that no one could have saved. <br /> <br />Problem 1: Impossible to cover the material in the book in 3 hours.  Viewers are rushed through so many plot developments that I can't imagine anyone who hadn't read the book understanding what the heck was going on.  And for the devotees of the novel, there is not enough detail to satisfy.  I mean, please! The Lord of the Rings, similar in depth and scope to Dune, had a theatrical release running time of over 9 hours! <br /> <br />Problem 2: Voice-overs.  The voice over narration is way over the top and not very informative. Hearing the character's thoughts in melodramatic whispers does nothing to advance the story line and is incredibly distracting.  Typical lines from the narration (imagine theatrical whispering):  \\"Could he be the one?\\"  \\"Melange!\\"  \\"The Spice!\\"  \\"Yes!\\" \\"Sting! Where Did You Get Your Abs?\\"  (Ok, I made up the last one). <br /> <br />Now, add in mediocre acting, poor special effects, murky soundtrack, uninspiring cinematography and you end up with a real stinker.  No one but a Dune fanatic could find anything of value here.
B000EGDC14|5.0|At first I despised this record so much that I got physically upset over it. Then, a year and a half later, it suddenly CLICKED. <br /> <br />I now hear the deep sadness in 'Number 1'--in every note. I now listen to 'Ooh La La' (even after all the commercials) and hear the intense raw energy. Also, 'Fly Me Away' (didn't watch TV around Christmas, thank god) and I just have really accepted the cuteness to that song (Alison said it herself on tour). <br /> <br />In the Goldfrapp catalogue, SUPERNATURE holds its own and carries the intense quality that comes with the Goldfrapp name. Although, yes undeniably \\"their safest album,\\" it continues to deliver during the passing time until their fourth album, and I forsee that it will still be just as listenable thereafter.
B000301YY8|4.0|heard briefly and loved it. went looking for the cd and am still enjoying his very unusual voice and amazing lyrics.
006097625X|5.0|I am not a hard-core comic fan, but this book was incredibly interesting. Scott shows how so much of the action happens in the tiny gap between panels. The psychology of the gap is important to understand for anyone who has to communicate information to others. This is a great book for aspiring comic publishers, but also for speakers, presenters and authors.
B0000025DT|5.0|All the songs flow together and as you listen to the album, you will find every song has that quality about it. Way ahead of its time! This is one album I would like to have on a desserted island! <br />
0399152717|5.0|Clive Cussler brings us another fantastic adventure from the NUMA Files. This time its Kurt Austin saving the world. I am so glad that Clive has decide to update the characters as Dirk was getting a bit long in the tooth, It is nice to see him pop up on occasion though. If you love rollicking adventure then this is the series for you! Fortunately the books are ALWAYS GREAT!!!! It is a fast paced style and great imagination bender.
0060194995|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is the best book I ever read and why I said this is because the author, Harper Lee, simply describe every scene with descriptive languages. Harper Lee described the environment of those people inside the story during the Great Depression. Harper Lee simply used her ideas and descriptive languages to show us how does those children at that time having fun by themselves and finding out who is Boo Radely. <br /> <br />The story begins with one of the main character, Scout which is also the narrator, showing a flashback of what happened before her brother Jem's arm was broken. Scout, Jem, and their friend Dill met many funny and nervous events and also telling us about their adventure of finding out who is Boo Radely. That also witnesses about the court scene where Atticus, which is Scout and Jem's father, helping Tom Robinson who is being accused from raping a girl. <br /> <br />This book is really interesting because it describe about how the kids during that time think and do and their attitude facing everything. While your reading the story you will feel like your also one of the character which is really fun. So I strongly recommended this book to everyone since it is interesting and the events happening inside is nervous and exciting. <br />
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I'll keep this short. As other reviewers have stated, this is not Pink Floyd, however it very well could be. Overall, the music has a quality similar to \\"Meddle\\", though the guitar tone and sharp production are more akin to \\"The Final Cut\\". Still, this album flows serenely from beginning to end. Listening to it feels like enjoying a breezy early autumn sunset, and it lingers in the mind. Not for the amped up speed junkies out there, this is definitely a chillout album, but is certainly a beautiful piece of work. Do yourself a favor and buy this album, if only for the soulful and expressive guitar work which is, as always, uniquely David Gilmour.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Having just seen Brokeback Mountain it is still hard to put into words the feelings you leave the theatre with. At first, the movie seems slow but little by little the characters and setting just draw you in. There isn't any escape from this film, once it has grabbed your soul it doesn't let go. It doesn't matter that this is about 2 men who fall deeply in love. It matters that 2 people love. Seeing the anguish and knowing they are living on borrowed time, for those short interludes of love, the pain they feel leaves a palpable pain in your heart. Even thinking about this movie, I get the same feeling of hopelessness and the desire to see a different ending. This movie is painful in its beauty and substance. It is by far one of the best films I have had the privilege of viewing. My one and only complaint was that it ended too soon. I left the theatre sobbing and humbled by two men who could portray such a strong passion for each other despite the odds. When this is out on DVD, I will be first in line to buy and keep this forever.
0780622553|5.0|I had not heard of this movie until Roger Ebert picked it as one of the year's best.  I rented it and fully agreed with his evaluation.  The movie is well directed and the story is original and very interesting.  Do not miss this.
B00009P1MP|1.0|DRM issues! <br /> <br />Don McLean's AMERICAN PIE has been a favorite of mine for many years.  I bought this CD last month to replace an older one.  When I ripped it to my husband's computer to play in his office, I got a message from MSN insisting that I download the license.  I knew there were issues with SONY encrypting CDs with software (spyware!) limiting your use, but I'm not sure what this is about -- the label says Capitol.  Anyway, I also can't get this music to play on my iRiver T30 -- which I suspect is also a DRM encryption issue.   <br /> <br />Yes, AMERICAN PIE is a masterpiece.  But buyer beware!  Your fair use of this CD will be limited.
076790592X|5.0|This book is a truly inspirational piece of work that I would recamend to EVERYONE.  If every person who read this book were to pass it on to someone else in his/her life, the world would be a better place!  This book teaches and reinforces the virtues of compassion, friendship, love and so many other of life's greatest lessons!  Tuesdays with Morrie is a fast read that draws you into the depths of the relationship between Mitch and his beloved teacher; it also draws you into the depths of your own being and encourages soul searching that leaves you feeling more complete.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Isn't it funny how a band like Pink Floyd could do no wrong even when Waters left? They sounded almost the same, and their stage show was almost the same. But some of the anger and spite that powered Floyd left with Waters. The only thing that kept Floyd together was the wonderful blues sound of Gilmour and his guitar. That was at least 40% of their greatness, and it was just enough to make up for Roger's absence. But it's not enough here. Am I impressed by Gilmour's Clapton-esque slowhand moves with the guitar? The answer is yes, and I always have been. Am I impressed with his songs? Well........ <br /> <br />Reflecting back on the past and hoping for the same future is not the way to approach this CD, but how can you not expect that from a member of one of the most influential bands of all time? This is the first solo Gilmour CD in 18 years, so you think he'd have a little more to offer. Apparently not. I am still trying to figure out the Floyd references in some of the reviews. The guitar sound belongs to Floyd. Music and lyrics: Deinitely not. <br /> <br />Granted, I've only listened to this CD twice, and twice seems to be my limit. Usually on a second listening, I find something that will grab me. It almost happened...... But not quite. <br /> <br />The guitar solos stand out (as they always do) but the rest just doesn't appeal to me in any way. Believe me, I've tried. But listening a third time tried my will, and I ejected the CD after the third song. As I said, the guitar work is still strong as ever. If Mr. Gilmour had made a fully instrumental album focusing on his talents as a guitarist, and used the same songs, my rating and praise would be so much higher. I'm sorry to say something doesn't seem right with the content. <br /> <br />This CD is very personal, and that is a problem. From what I understand, Gilmour's wife wrote the majority of the songs. For David, I guess that's alright. For me as a fan of 'his' music, it's not. The songs are nothing more than willowy and breathy pinings. David Crosby and Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills, & Nash fame) add harmony on the title track. While it's a nice touch, it can't save the rest of the album. I thought about this song a few weeks back when it fist came out. Usually you realease your strongest material to generate some buzz. My first thought after hearing it was: \\"And what else?????\\" If that was Mr. Gilmour's strongest material, this CD would head down the toilet fast. <br /> <br />I suppose it's inevitable to feel let down by the end product because you've secretly wanted Dark Side of the Moon Part 2 for the last 30 years. How can you not dream of that after seeing all of Pink Floyd together for Live 8? I should have known better than expect something as grandiose as that! But my question to Mr. Gilmour (and Mr. Waters for that matter) is this: Is your downfall in recording and content over time simply the result of a desire to distance yourself from what paid the rent for 30 years? Or is it fading into soft middle age with all the money coming from royalty checks that drives off the hunger you once had in your music? <br /> <br />Is the CD listenable? Sort of. <br /> <br />Is it good? I wouldn't go that far. <br /> <br />Is Mr. Gilmour a brilliant musician? Yes. Always. But this effort is not worthy of what I expect. Finally: Will it grow on me? Hard to say, but I doubt it.
0441012906|5.0|This seems to have got a fairly negative reaction amongst the online community. However a lot of the genre press have rated it highly. And so do I. I think a lot of this comes from the fact that only really the first 100 and the last 100 pages are real \\"hard sf\\" the rest being a sort of film noir with fog, Paris and jazz. Personally I loved it but then I am a big fan of both reynolds and uchronia. <br /> <br />Anyway I think it is worth a try.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|This film was one of the best movies of the past year.  Joaquin Phoenix should have won the Oscar for this performance of which he immersed himself in and delivered an amazing performance. Reese Witherspoon was equally as impressive as June Carter Cash capturing her strength and spark.  This movie is honest and real. It shows a legend - flaws and all - and I feel it's a brave movie to tell the truth.  Bravo!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Once you listen to P!ATD and then go back to other music, you realize just what a great mixture \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" is. Compared to this, all other albums sound like one giant boring song. P!ATD managed to put together a great CD with a wonderful mixture of different and addicting beats that will never leave you bored. A great buy!

0385507755|4.0|i bought this for my mother and she seemed to enjoy it she loves opra and aperantly this book too (sorry cant spell)so id recomend this book to anyone who loves to read this kind of stuff.
0553277472|3.0|Unfortunately, I have to agree with the previous writer here, Scott Carson, in his much more detailed review, that this book just didn't live up to its reputation. At the risk of criticizing one of the most legendary books of the metaphysically itinerant, agoraphobic, and spiritually questing 60s, I just didn't find it to be particularly deep, although it is sometimes entertaining and I did learn a few things here and there. But I'd heard about how profound the book was and about all the deep philosophy in it, but really, it doesn't even get to the level of your typical college Philosophy 1A class. As an introduction to Zen there are some occasionally interesting tidbits, but here too, the actual philosophy is pretty light.<br /><br />I'm sure this book did literally affect and change the lives of millions of people who read it and thought it was great, but then, they probably weren't that well read in philosophy so it was all new. That's fine, there's value in educating the general public on matters metaphysical and on basic philosophy and also eastern philosophy and Zen. If the book did that in some people's minds, then my hat's off to Pirsig, but I personally found it to be pretty thin gruel considering the book's amazingly stellar reputation. I give the book 3 stars for its historical importance and for its being one of the most important literary icons of the period, and also for effort, but really, that's being generous.<br /><br />If you want to read a better book on eastern philosophy, I would recommend you try Alan Watts's The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are. I never gave Watts his full due of respect back in the 60's and 70's, because at the time I saw him as a trendy popularizer perhaps cashing in on the interest of that segment of the western readership who are perennially eastern-obsessed and therefore too naive and uncritical of their philosophy. Back then, there were just too many young people, who, having rejected whatever western culture they were brought up in, simply accepted, lock, stock, and barrel, Tao, Vedanta, and/or Buddhism after having read one or two books and therefore having finally discovered \\"the truth.\\"<br /><br />Well, looking back, that's perhaps too harsh an assessment, and I will say that Watts's book is an extremely well-written, concise, and clear introduction to Vedantic thought that is as relevant today as it was 35 years ago. I recently picked up the book after 30 years, and found that in many ways I enjoyed it even more than I did back then.<br /><br />As others have commented more completely on the usefulness and relevance of the philosophy in the book, I will just mention one thing. I really enjoyed his discussion about the fear of death. Watts points out that the way western culture deals practically and philosophically with death, isolating the individual from feeling a part of the universe as a whole on the one hand, and as basically a taboo subject, on the other, is unproductive and ultimately does nothing to resolve the issue. He points out that the denial process of sweeping it under the rug only makes it worse, and that ultimately the only solution is to just face one's fear. If death frightens you or makes you afraid, well then, be afraid. At least be honest about it, because that's the first step to realistically starting to deal with the problem.<br /><br />The reality is, that no matter how certain one is of one's religion, no-one truly knows if there is an afterlife. It is possible that all these beliefs simply represent a wishful-thinking and wish-fulfillment response to a realistic fear--the fear of death. Until one admits that and confronts the issue head on, it will continue to haunt you despite your most cherished beliefs to the contrary.rought up in, simply accepted, lock, stock, and barrel, Tao, Vedanta, and/or Buddhism after having read one or two books and therefore having finally discovered \\"the truth.\\"    Well, looking back, that's perhaps too harsh an assessment, and I will say that Watts's book is an extremely well-written, concise, and clear introduction to Vedantic thought that is as relevant today as it was 35 years ago.

0061122092|1.0|This was one of the worst books I've ever read. It tries to weave together a romance story with some sort of spirituality.  While readers who like \\"trade\\" romance stories might like this, it is definitely NOT spiritual.  In fact, that's part of what I really detested about the book.  It's a huge farce.  <br /> <br />With so many truly great books in publication--well written with good character development, rivoting plots and meaning, why anyone would read this and think it worth anything more than one star, is beyond me.
0156027321|2.0|This is the reason why Indians wouldn't like this book, and why it couldn't be told by \\"real Piscine\\"  the way it was: It is written in an over-patronizing way. It is an attitude that Indians very much dislike. Life of Pi is roughly a nice tale but it would be much more nice if Martel just backed off the stage. To me, Martel is not a talented writer but a boring philosopher with a bad attitude to readers. The book is therefore quite an opposite of what the author proclaims it to be. It would not convince you of the existence of god(s) but may make you turn away from religion(s) which Martel so eagerly tries to advocate.
B000002UJQ|5.0|One of the best albums of the last 20 years, and amongst the canon of last century's greatest albums. It's clearly not for everyone, (even though it should be!), but this album for me is incredibly moving, clever, haunting, beautiful, emotional, angry and powerful. It deserves a decent intelligent listen.
B000AJJNOK|5.0|G.G-G-unit!!! We all know who is controlling the game right now and is nowhere close from falling off. His name is Fifty-Cent and his new album is called \\"The Massacre\\".  It's really dope and it might just be better than his first one. As long as he keeps his production tight and doin' it right he will stay on top. The Maccacre has dope beats on every track and Fifty's versatility keeps the creative level on each song different and they don't all sound the same. My favorite track has got to be the collabo with Mobb Deep called \\"Outta Control\\". The beat on \\"Jus A Lil Bit\\" is tight too and what makes the song dope. Disco Inferno is the \\"club banga\\"  and this song will make the ladies move and shake up in the club. Overall, this album is pretty dope and something you need to bang in ya mans jeep.
0394800184|5.0|This is a book I rate right up there with all the other childrens classics.
0393035158|1.0|Harris' book is yet another variation of the standard line preached by most apologists for modern atheism.  He frames the discussion by defining his world view as being about \\"rationality,\\" \\"facts,\\" and \\"science;\\"  all others are non-rational \\"belief.\\"  Never mind that his own naturalism is a belief as well, but like so many other issues in his book, he either doesn't understand this, chooses to ignore it, or assumes it uncritically.  And from this initial premise, he goes on to enumerate all the well-known extreme stereotypes (the radical Muslim blowing up a bus, for example) and then wraps it all up by restating his presupposition as a conclusion:  All \\"faith\\" is bad.   <br /> <br />And the details aren't any better than the broad conclusion; here are just a few:   <br /> <br />He spends a fair amount of time harping on the \\"intolerance\\" of religious believers.  I found myself wondering if Harris has ever read the likes of Richard Dawkins, one of the great high priests of modern atheism, who has famously labeled anyone who doesn't see things his way as \\"ignorant, stupid, insane, or wicked.\\"  Hmmm... The more accurate statement is that radical ideologues of any stripe tend to be intolerant, but that broader idea doesn't fit into Harris' thesis so he is free to ignore the inconvenient examples of intolerance as it is manifested by atheists.   <br /> <br />But Dawkins and his ilk are a minor irritation compared to the Great Atheists of the 20th century: Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot, and Mao Zedong among them, whom Harris also fails to discuss.  Which faith inspired in these men the murder of millions, and the misery of countless millions more?  Which faith motivated their ghastly atrocities?  The answer, of course, is Harris' own atheism. But, well, these examples don't fit with the thesis either.  <br /> <br />On the other side of the coin, he ignores the mountains of good that have been done by people with spiritual--and particularly Judeo-Christian--motivations.  History is replete with individuals whose courage, sacrifice and humanitarian efforts have arisen from the rich soil of their faith:  Lincoln, King, Wilberforce, Solzhenitsyn, Tutu, Bonhoffer, Ten Boom, Carter, and Mother Theresa come to mind.  All of these--and many, many more--did what they did specifically because they were believers.  But like the negative counter-examples discussed above, such examples of faith inspiring positive good don't support his argument, so he leaves them out too.   <br /> <br />Finally, the largest of the omissions is an explanation of his basis for identifying anything as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" in the first place.  Naturalism tells us explicitly that we are molecules in motion and nothing more.  Our existence is accidental, and we are undesigned. If morality can be said to exist at all, it has been selected for by an unthinking, uncaring natural force--quite the incongruity, if you think about it, that such a force can be the genesis of right and wrong, particularly if we expect right and wrong to be binding in any way.  Thus, a naturalist has no more basis to argue that we should act according to a certain moral code than he does to argue that we should have blue eyes, because everything that we are is the accumulation of random mutations that happened to have made it past Natural Selection's arbitrary filter.  And so, Harris is like a man enthusiastically hacking away at the branch that his ladder is leaning against; he is advocating the abandonment of the theism whose moral framework is the only basis for his argument in the first place.  And this is more than a little ironic.  <br /> <br />In the end, you can argue for any point of view if you're free to leave out those inconvenient facts that don't fit with your opinion, and right down the line, Harris does this is a way that would make most Southern Baptists squirm in their seat.  His book will play well with the self-proclaimed \\"intellectual rationalist\\" crowd, those who come to the table with a commitment to shelter their a-priori naturalism from the ravages of careful examination.  For anyone whose mind is still open, however, the rich irony is that The End of Faith is nothing more than a statement of Harris' own faith dressed up in a quasi-intellectual suit.   <br />

0800141849|5.0|I am not one of those die hard Barbra Streisand fans that follows everything she does, don't get me wrong, I love her music and movies, I love her for many reasons but the most obvious one should be the quality that Barbra Streisand brings to her work. This film is another example of a quality effort, all brilliant actors, excellent story line and the music as expected is supurb....I forced all my friends to go and see it when it came out in the cinema's, they are mostly NOT Barbra Streisand fans but they all enjoyed the film and laughed all through it, it was great. The film delivered Romance, Music, Jeff Bridges as the hansom male actor and Barbra Streisand was lovely as the main character Rose, Lauren Bacall was a scene stealer all the way through the film and I only wish it had been longer, I enjoyed it so much I did not want it to end, it left a nice feeling.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I'm a *huge* fan of Pink Floyd and David Gilmour in particular. I've always loved his guitar work with Floyd, and when I heard he was releasing a new studio album, I knew I had to purchase it immediately and all I have to say is this---wow. This is some of THE best music I've ever heard. It is soothing. It is surreal. It is pure sonic euphoria of the highest possible standards. Beautiful, haunting soundscapes and bluesy, lush guitars blend perfectly with Gilmour's ethereal voice to create an atmosphere not found on m(any) of today's records. I am very happy with my purchase of this record, and you should be too. Just don't expect a Pink Floyd record.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Great music. Madeleine is a very talented woman. Her voice is peaceful and melodic. Personally, I think the French definately know there jazz.
0553213105|5.0|One never gets tired of reading Pride and Prejudice.  I cannot remember how many times I have read it, but each time I do I enjoy it more and more.  Jane Austen's Books never cease to take you back to a time when people cared about good manners, and people were expected to behave politely.  Of course, the emphasis placed on marrying based almost exclusively on material things shows us what a long way we have come in some respects, but how little we have changed in others.  Ultimately, this story is one about the triumph of true love despite obstacles, and is timeless in that sense.
B00008977N|4.0|As with all of Peter Gabriel's projects, this one ranges from pedestrian to good to GREAT.  If it wasn't for the rather grainy (it was filmed in a European auditorium full of cigarette smoke, I guess) image quality, I would give it five stars overall.  Musically it IS five stars.

B000E8N690|2.0|While the acting of Phoenix is very strong, he did not convey the endearing side of Cash, and that is more the writer or directors mistake, and I must agree with J Whitney that the two actors just don't have the chemistry either. And, while the cinema realite is very internal, I think the end of the film was wanting, because Mangold chose to ignore Cash's Nickajack Cave incident, which was his lowest point and his struggle with God... and as a result, it missed Cash's epiphanic moment.    One thing Hollywood won't get is the heart of evangelical religion.    Cash took it all to the edge to show that life is a messy conflux. That is why he is loved by people of all sorts, a very rare type.    Three stars are missing...

B000E97Y6K|5.0|It seems that so many of the negatives are aimed at the film's length.  Perhaps those who have a hard time sitting still for 3 hours will enjoy the film when they can take periodic breaks.  I had no problem sitting for three hours.  The film is basically in four parts: New York, The Boat Trip, Skull Island, Back to New York.  I was captivated by the first part as I watched an amazing depiction of New York City circa 1930 in full color. I also enjoyed getting to know the characters and am at odds with those who disliked Jack Black.  He had that almost crazed look in his eyes and struck the right tone as a director who would risk so much to achieve fame. Naomi Watts was absolutely radient and was a joy to watch.  The Skull Island sequences provided dazzling, edge-of-your-seat entertainment with a truly believable CGI ape battling harrowing creatures.  And lastly, the Empire State scene was breathtaking and Peter Jackson did a great job creating empathy for the great Kong.  All told, this was an excellent modern reimagining of a great story.
B00004Z4UW|1.0|Shortly following the DVD release of the first \\"Matrix\\" film, Warner Bros. used a smaller studio called Creative Design Art to make a specially designed package to help promote their incredibly successful movie. Their first result was this, the \\"Platinum Limited Edition DVD Collector's Set,\\" which originally retailed for $79 (or close to that). In my opinion, even if you're a hardcore fan of the Matrix films, this packagejust isn't worth the money, It comes in a box about two-inches thick, which makes you think you're really getting your money's worth, but as soon as you open it up -- you become disappointed. Most of this packaging is taken up by a flimsy plastic tray that contains a 35mm celluloid film frame of  with a nice blown-up photo. Then there are 8 \\"limited edition\\" lobby cards prints (which are really just postcard-sized stills from the movie), a full-sized poster, and the the same copy of the family you probably already own -- in the standard DVD keep-case (the cheapist kind of DVD packaging). All of the other extras mentioned in this package (full-length audio commentary, \\"Take The Red Pill\\" featurette) are the same features found in original DVD release. Although it's Out-Of-Print now, I've noticed you can get one used for around $20, which isn't too bad, but it's probably not even worth the effort if you already own the first movie on DVD. <br /> <br />Warner Bros. wasn't entirely pleased with the sales generated from the Platinum Limited Edition, so they asked Creative Design Art to create a more definitive version for consumers to buy. Their second project was \\"The Matrix / The Matrix Revisited (The Gold Edition)\\" which retailed for $100 (and can also be found on Amazon.com). The one advantage of this new package was that it also contained the just-released 163-minute behind-the-scenes DVD \\"The Matrix Revisited\\" along with the original movie, but it also has a few \\"carryovers\\" from Creative Design's last project (namely, the senitype image from the movie, and a 35mm film frame). The cheap plastic insert from before has now been replaced with a luxury fitted slipcase, and a 16-page commemorative book. But still, all of the features found on the same previously-released DVDs are found here. Aside from the packaging, there's no additional footage whatsoever, whether it's in the form of deleted scenes or bonus videos. The film frame doesn't even have \\"Dolby Digital\\" printed on it like it's supposed to, which means that it's not even a real frame of film (because that would cost the publisher money) -- it's just a cheap no-sound fabrication. <br /> <br />Eventually, Warner Bros. would release a definitive collection of their own instead of using a third-party, entitled \\"The Ultimate Matrix Collection\\" which is the 10-disc DVD box-set of all the movies and their corresponding \\"Revisited\\" features, plus more. Even better, you can get the ultimate collection for around $30 used on Amazon.com. Actual film frames are somewhat interesting, but if you don't really care about that kind of thing, then just get  the \\"Ultimate Matrix Collection.\\" You really do get a lot more for your money.

0765315246|5.0|On his 75th birthday, John Perry joins the Colonial Defense Force.  He and his fellow geriatric soldiers will fight the various alien races out there in the universe, who are competing with Earth for the few habitable, colonizable planets available.  In return, the seniors receive young, virile and fascinatingly modified new bodies and a chance to join the colonists in a second lifetime, should they survive their term of service. <br /> <br />As many others have noted, the debt to Heinlein is obvious but this book stands terrifically well on its own.  This is no slavish imitation but an original exploration of what it would be like to have 70+ years of life experience in an amazing new body, while taking on nearly impossible fighting situations where frightening aliens do their best to destroy that body.  From the enlistment process to training to the first missions, it is a fascinating journey, heightened by the particular experiences of John Perry in his unique experiences fighting the aliens and later negotiating with them, and acting as one of the few \\"regular\\" soldiers to work with the mysterious \\"Ghost Brigades\\". <br /> <br />I literally could not put this book down.  I read it in one long evening, staying up far too late.  When I tried to make myself go to sleep, I kept wondering about what was going to happen in the story and ended up getting back up and reading til the book was finished.  Few books engross me in this way and almost no science fiction has in recent memory, so I feel confident in endorsing this book as an excellent combination of fascinating speculation/extrapolation wrapped in a suspenseful and exciting plot.  I cannot wait to read the sequel and will be eager to read anything else John Scalzi has in store.

006056251X|3.0|This is the third book in a four book series.  The first two were: Secrets Of A Summer Night and It Happened One Autumn.   <br /> <br />The first book I would rate as a 4 star.  The second a 5 star.  This one rates only a 3 star despite having the two most interesting characters in the series.   <br /> <br />I love the idea of the shy, stuttering virgin with the world weary rake.  The problem was with the execution.  This is not something I would normally ever say about a Lisa Kleypas novel.   <br /> <br />My problems with this book were as follows: <br /> <br />1. Sebastian seemed to convert from cold and aloof to warm and tender much too fast.   <br /> <br />2. After the elopement, the main characters stayed in one location for the rest of the book.  I would have loved to see how they acted in polite society after their marriage.  I would have dearly loved to see how other people treated them in society.   <br /> <br />3.  The villians seemed to be evil for the sake of being evil.  I know this is romance, but give me some layers and dimension to your secondary (and tertiary) characters, please.   <br /> <br />4. From the previous novel we know that Sebastian is estranged from his father.  It would have been nice to have a scene with his father in it in this book. <br /> <br />Things I liked about this book: <br /> <br />1. The love scenes.  Say what you will about the rest of the book, Lisa Kleypas knows how to write a really steamy sex scene without overdosing on the cheese factor.   <br /> <br />2. The Gretna Green wedding.  I've read dozens of romance novels that feature an \\"anvil wedding\\" but none ever gave as much detail as this one.  Kudos for that. <br /> <br />Overall, it's certainly worth reading.  Although, I might suggest waiting until you can get it at a used bookstore.   <br /> <br />If this is your first Lisa Kleypas book, may I suggest reading \\"Dreaming of You?\\"  It's one of her best.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is David Gilmour, and not the Floyd as so many before me have stated. Right from the start his guitar comes to life, and you know exactly what you've got. It is mellow, and cool throughout, and sounds more like the pre-Darkside Floyd than anything some \\"fans\\" might have heard. The vocals are solid, and the organ playing of Rick Wright is undeniable, it sounds like stuff from Wish You Were Here, and the last album The Division Bell. If you are looking for a Pink Floyd album it is highly likely you'll be disappointed, but the music here regardless is fantastic. David Gilmour was and is still a great guitar player, and his sound has remained for the last 40 years as brilliant as ever.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Last night was the Academy Awards and I must say that I'm really disappointed. For months Brokeback was given such high reviews, not to mention all the awards that it received except for ONE. It's a shame that our society cannot except everyone for who they are and what their sexual preference is. I saw Brokeback Mountain at the end of January and I still think about it everyday. Some people might say that sounds a little over the top but that's how much the story impacted me. A film has never made me feel so emotional. It's a love story...plain and simple...but it's much, much more. God love you Ang Lee for making such a wonderful film! All of the actors should be so proud of themselves also. I'm sorry, I have seen Crash and it was a very good movie, but it should have never won for best picture. I think Hollywood got so paranoid thinking an openly gay movie was actually going to win and had to put a stop to it. That's only my opinion.... I loved this movie, it is my favorite to date and will be in my heart forever. It is the BEST OF 2005!
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is not a Pink Floyd CD.  This is a David Gilmour CD.  Don't make that mistake.  His guitar is as sweet sounding as ever.  Personally, I like his first solo effort the best, but this one is growing on me fast.  The Division Bell took about a week to grow on me, and it is one of my favorites now.  Yes, I am a David Gilmour fan.  This is my favorite CD this year so far.  I would love to see him play live again.
1400032717|5.0|\\"The curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" by Mark Haddon is a most original, touching, heartwarming and heartbreaking book.<br /><br />I am always amazed when an author writes so convincingly in the first person in a voice so unlike their own.  In the curious incident, that voice is the autistic Christopher Boone, a 15 year old living in Swinton, England.  Christopher lives with his father and attends a special school.  He is brilliant in math and science, yet does not operate as a normal teen on other levels.  One evening, he discovers that his neighbor's poodle has been murdered.  Christopher is at first a suspect, but when it is discovered that he is not the killer, he decides to play detective (he loves Sherlock Holmes).  In the process, he solves more than one mystery and surprises himself with some of the things he accomplishes.  His goal is to write a story about his investigation, which becomes the book.<br /><br />Haddon is a genius at seeing life through the eyes of an autistic child.  Christopher does not process information like a normal child.  He does not understand emotions and does not understand jokes.  He does have a photographic memory, which sometimes can lead to sensory overload.  But sometimes, taking out all the \\"extras\\" (like emotions) actually helps Christopher to see the problem more clearly, and then he can use logic to find a solution.  The book is also filled with math problems, puzzles, and drawings of how Christopher sees his world.  One nice touch is that the chapters are given prime numbers as Christopher loves primes (as opposed to numbering them 1, 2, 3, etc.).<br /><br />Mark Haddon has published a number of books for children, and \\"the curious incident\\" was published with two different covers--one for children and one for adults.  Whoever his target audience might be, he's a very talented writer.
B00005R24K|3.0|I read the reviews and i like zombie movies so i bought this one there were a few great gore scenes and alot of blood but i didnt really like it you cant say its scary its hilarous but thats about it
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|<br />This version was good but isn't any where near as good as the 1995 version. The chemistry between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet wasn't near what is was with the 1995 (Firth and Ehle) version either. I did like the very ending of this version a little better. I also thought that the Mr. Bennet and the Mrs. Bennet in the 95 version was much better. This version was too condensed for me too. If you never saw the 95, you will probably love this one. But if you saw the 95 one first, I believe that you will be disappointed.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens demonstrates that he is a brilliant songwriter and composer.  His use of a small ensemble to create various moods is exceptional and his lyrics are some of the best poetry I have heard in recent years.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead is one of those bands that are a little under rated when they shouldn't be.  Upon first listening, this album appears slow and slightly wierd.  But after listening to it a couple of times, the songs caught on with their mellow tunes and impressive lyrics.  I also have 'The Bends'(4 stars) and I still prefer OK Computer.  Friends of mine who have all of Radiohead's albums, say that OK Computer is Radiohead's best album.  I wouldn't know but I can see (or hear) why.<br /><br />Overall, this is a remarkable album that can only be achieved by the talented voice of Tom Yorke.  One of my favourite albums.  A must.<br /><br />(My favourite songs off this album include Karma Police and Climbing Up The Walls.)
B0000047CW|4.0|Not as good as the Getz/Gilberto album (how many albums are?) recorded two years later, but it is a very enjoyable effort by saxman Getz and guitarist Charlie Byrd. Unlike the Getz/Gilberto record, this one has no vocals. It's a short and sweet instrumental effort without a note wasted or misplaced. Desafinado (\\"Out of Tune\\") and Samba de Uma Nota So (\\"One Note Samba\\") are the standouts. The album is expensive considering the 35 minute playing time, but you will listen to it many times, trust me.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|so here is Cash's final album, a collection of covers and original songs.  while not all of the covers work perfectly, some of them are immensly powerful, and what is presented here is often very depressing.  <br /> <br />the most well known song being the nine inch nails cover 'hurt' is unbelievably emotional; you will swear he wrote it.  other covers that are fantastic in my mind are sting's 'i hung my head,' a great fit for cash, ewan macoll's classic 'the first time ever i saw your face,' which may be my favorite version, and 'bridge over troubled water' by paul simon.  cash's original numbers are all great too, i mostly wish there were a couple more on this record that he wrote.  the title track is a great opening song, and sets the stage for an emotional complex recording, a song like 'sam hall' gives a humorous side to the record that is great. <br /> <br />while it is rather odd hearing cash cover depeche mode, the fact of the matter remains that cash could really cover a song.  when cash does someone elses song he doesn't just play it, he makes it his own everytime.  his voice will cut through you.
B000002UA0|3.0|So it was the late 60's. Psychedelia was one of the top trends in music and Pink Floyd had already two succesfull chart singles Arnold Layne and See Emily play. They were two obvious Beatles imitations. They could easily fit to any Beatles album. After hearing them I thought that this is gonna be somekind of a weak Sgt.Pepper carbon copy. I also knew that this album was recorded next room to Beatles in Abbey Road. But I was wrong. This album turned out to be the most original and unique album Pink Floyd has ever done. They never really recaptured this sound. <br /> <br />Yes Pink Floyd followed the Beatles and there are some Beatles esque melodies especially in shorter songs. The piper at the gates of dawn was written almost exclusively by Barret. Only exception is Take your stethoscope and walk penned by Roger Waters, but I have to say that his debut composition failed completely. This album has a few strong points. One of them is Syd Barret's childlike fairy tale lyrics. They are charming. Another one is his pretty personal and psychedelic guitar sound. This album is also more experimental than Sgt.Pepper. Every song is at least little psychedelic. But this album has some problems too. It is mostly dated and even thought it's experimental it somehow fails to sound deep. Songs that are not dated are Astronomy domine, Pow R toc H and Interstellar overdrive. <br /> <br />Bike captures Syd Barret's madness perfectly and is a great closer. What a crap! It is a completely idiotic song both lyrically and musically. They should have left it over or recorded just sound effects in the end. Interstellar overdrive captures perfectly an experimental spirit of the late 60's. It is the most experimental thing on the whole album. It sounds a little bit too improvisational in some places, but is an okay song. My favourite songs are Astronomy domine (Great guitar work by barret), Matilda mother, Flaming and Pow R toc H (The most mysterious song on the album). <br /> <br />Correct rating would be 3 1/2 stars. This album has charm that's missing in Gilmour era works, but it is not as tight or conceptual as their classics and it doesn't have great guitar solos like on The wall. I don't think this album is as creative as Dark side of the moon, but it was a pretty good start for one of the finest prog rock bands.        <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B000078DOI|5.0|right from the get go you know that this is going to be awesome. flea and john are just ripping everything to shreads and this is all before the song actually kicks in!! i have to say that i like this one the most just because of how much material they cover. they've got the fast, the slow, the danceable, the funk, it's all here! if you're just getting in the chili peppers this is absolutely the next album you need to buy.  <br /> <br />if you want my advice, get this and get some fishbone. you won't be let down.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I have long admired Gilmour's voice and guitar, but I was struck by the personal nature of this record, as well as the rich texture and depth. Very well recorded, excellent guitar work and vocals. Similar to pink Floyd in sound and recording quality, but not as detached and sterile. Great record.
B0000669JL|5.0|i know, i know, it's cliche to be into best of's. i also know that this really doesn't showcase marley that well. but damn boy, this is a great record! all these songs are great!! the flow of the album almost feels like he wrote it this way. i can't complain about this at all.  <br /> <br />if you like this and haven't heard much marley i'd suggest picking up catch a fire and burnin'. after that you should jump over to peter tosh and bunny wailer.

B000096FUD|4.0|A documentary about the making of a film that never got past the shooting of a couple of scenes doesn't seem to promise much, but the story of what was to turn out to be a real-life \\"disaster movie\\" is riveting stuff.     Terry Gilliam's obsession with \\"Don Quixote\\" is infectious and his enthusiasm for the task he faces coupled with glimpses of what it could have been really make you wish that things had turned out better. The insights into how a film is planned and the hugely complex logistics of a \\"live shoot\\" are fascinating, while the build-up to the almost inevitable collapse of the project, compounded by unbelievably bad weather and the illness of the central actor, coupled with the impacts of it all on those involved, is about as far removed from the typical self-congratulatory \\"making of the movie\\" add-on as you can get. Finally, the whole sorry affair - in particular Gilliam's persistent & unbridled optimism in the face of virtually insurmountable odds as he pursues the chance to realise a long-standing dream - becomes a quite bizarre, tragi-comic parallel to \\"Don Quixote\\" itself.     You may only watch this once, and renting is therefore probably the best option, but you won't be disappointed.
0060899190|4.0|I've always loved the PostSecret website in a morbid, voyeuristic way.  Digging into other people's lives, and often times in such a poetic fashion, is the nicest of guilty pleasures. <br />And while all of the above is present in the book, the presentation is lacking.  The pages aren't glossy, which I would have preferred, and oftentimes the postcards are arranged thoughtlessly - a single postcard can be stretched across two pages, with the center writing being lost between the book's crease. <br />Also, having been a frequent fan of the website, I noticed that certain postcards that I absolutely loved were not included in the book, which was disappointing considering the size and cost.  But still, owning these personal pieces of art is worth it for all of the small complaints.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|I love Dune.  That being said, it has been some years since i saw the extended version and my memory of it was better than the actual event.  However, I had a ton of fun watching it.  Watching one Dune after the other gives an immediate testimony of the greatness of David Lynch's Dune.

B00080ZG10|4.0|It's unfortunate that Howard Hughes' late-in-life degeneration overshadows his brilliant and pioneering efforts in aviation and cinema in his youth and middle age.  \\"The Aviator\\" focuses on Hughes' accomplishments, and sympathetically handles his obsessive-compulsive disorder - something that doctors and psychologists couldn't do 70 years ago.  I hadn't realized just how large Hughes' contributions to the world of aviation were.  DeCaprio does an excellent job of portraying Hughes, re-confirming the fact that he can really act.  The story is interesting and seems to conform to the facts pretty well, unusual in a Hollywood biopic.  And Alan Alda once again shows that he is one of Hollywood's great older actors, putting in a great understated performance as Hughes' nemesis Senator Brownback.<br /><br />So why just 4 stars?  Two reasons.  First, \\"The Aviator\\" is just too long.  30 minutes could have been trimmed from this film easily, and would have greatly improved it.  Second, Cate Blanchett is truly awful in this movie.  Her Hepburn is awkward and unlikeable, as she imitates the mannerisms of the elderly (not the younger) Hepburn and pronounces her lines with a wildly variable accent.  Is she Southern?  British?  Massachusettsian?  Pick one and then just give her a few seconds.  Blanchett is often great, but definitely not here.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|What do you get when you combine the musical genius of John Williams with talented virtuoso performances by cellist Yo-Yo Ma and violinist Itzhak Perlman? Perfection of course!<br /><br />'Memoirs of a Geisha' graces the listener with -18 tracks- of some of the best music not to win an Academy Award. Moving effortlessly between traditional and contemporary musical forms, John Williams demonstrates why he is the undisputed master of the motion picture soundtrack.<br /><br />The music is delicate, soothing and immediately accessible as it gently transports the listener to another time, another place, another culture. You will literally discern your heart begin to slow down and your breath become softer, more shallow as your body atunes to the mood and emotion of these tranquil compositions.<br /><br />Truly a wonderful and exhilarating listening experience and a testament to all involved in the creation of this masterful musical production.

B000E6UK5K|1.0|This is certainly not About Face, nor is it Division Bell or DSoTM.  I was not expecting (nor necessarily hoping for) a repeat of past albums, but I was also not expecting an album whose lyrics seem to be written entirely by someone other than David.  His musical arrangement, likely crafted around the previously penned lyrics, almost sounds like he \\"mailed it in.\\"  Knowing DG and his work ethic and perfectionist nature, the results are surprisingly subpar (and I hate to admit it, but the lyrics do come across as a bit sophomoric as suggested by previous posters.) <br /> <br />I'd not go so far as to make comparisons to Yoko Ono or Linda McCartney and their musical involvement with their spouses, but there may be more than a passing resemblance to David's working relationship with Polly. <br /> <br />The David Crosby cameo is a nice touch - proabably a highlight of the album.  I'd not be looking for a radio hit off this album, and cannot recommend it to all but the most hardcore of PF and DG fans.
B000E1155E|4.0|This is a 'Cracking' album, and I have more reason to hate them than most being than I am a proud Lancastrian as opposed to a Yorkshireman (Big rivalry!) <br /> <br />I don't normally write reviews but this album is well worth it. Unless you've been out in England on a Friday or Saturday night you might struggle with a few bit's, but most of it is universal to any country. <br /> <br />I usually class an album as good from four solid tracks, but this manages eight or nine. <br /> <br />If I had to pick my faves: <br /> <br />I bet you... <br />Fake tales... <br />Ritz to.. <br />When the sun.. <br />A certain... <br /> <br /> <br />LANCASHIRE FOREVER  !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000IFWE|3.0|This album is pretty good. Most of Tom Petty's albums, such as Full Moon Fever, Into The Great Wide Open, Wildflowers, and the earlier stuff have a certain summery, happy-go-lucky feel to them. Echo and The Last DJ have taken on a darker vibe. I'm not saying I don't like the latter two albums, but that happy summery feel was what I always associated Tom Petty with. So, these two albums sorta feel like anomolies to me. Having said that, this album is decent. It's got its good songs and its so-so ones. One thing I dont get is why everyone is knocking Rhino Skin in their reviews. The lyrics may be a bit odd at parts, but the idea is right on, the music is great, and the strings are gorgeous. And to the reviewer who wrote that this song is like a joke: what do you expect? I wouldn't exactly say Tom Petty is the most serious of songwriters. He's got his fair share of odd, jokey songs - probably more so than any other band I know or like. (I just think Petty shoulda named the song Elephant Balls. It's got a better ring to it than Rhino Skin :))<br /><br />Anyways, out of all of Petty's albums, Echo isn't at the top for me. In fact, I like The Last DJ more. I dunno... maybe I gotta listen to it more.

B00006690G|1.0|There are only a few things that I HATE. War, violence toward women, alcohol, and EMINEM. And of all those things, I can avoid three of them, but I can't avoid Eminem. Why? Because he and his record distributors have completely brainwashed an entire generation into thinking this guy is GANGSTER-GOD!  <br />--- FLASH! Eminem is THE reason we are having so much trouble with our young teenagers. He sings about hate, and violence toward EVERYTHING. And the kids get their information from HIM about how to treat women and situations. They emulate it, just like they have from every rock star forever.  <br />--- This isn't MUSIC, this is SLAM-POETRY. -- I DEFY EMINEM TO STOP HIDING BEHIND THE BIG BEAT AND PUBLISH HIS BOOK OF THOUGHTS. He never will. He doesn't want you to read what he's REALLY saying, least you see his true colors.  <br />----I wish I was allowed to say what I really think about Eminem because your ears would be burning.  <br />---DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER ALBUM BY EMINEM. DON'T GIVE HIM YOUR MONEY!! DON'T PAY FOR THIS MALICIOUS HATE !!!
0385339089|5.0|John Grisham's, The Client was extremely thrilling and kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was suspenseful and humorous several times throughout the book.   I enjoyed it all the way through, it kept asking so many questions to where I had to keep reading.  I could barely even put it down.  John Grisham put so much emotion into the book I could almost feel the characters feelings.  Grisham illustrates in such a way I admired it from the beginning.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes books about lawyers and to anyone who likes suspenseful and emotional books.  This book was an easy read and I hope you enjoy it.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I really like this CD. I didn't expect this to be the next \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". It is what it is-good compositionas with excellent guitarwork....As someone once said, Gilmour can make a banjo sound like a stratavarious...His guitar sings on \\"Blue\\" and \\"On an Island\\"... There are some heavier, blusey moments on \\"Take a Breath\\"...\\"Where We Start\\" could come off Division Bell...Excellent guest appearances by Graham Nash,David Crosby and Richard Wright. This is definately a great disc to bring with you \\"on an island\\"!
B0001IMKTA|5.0|This is the album with what it all began. And I tell you in advance, debut albums as this one are not made anymore. Its an extrordinary piece of music in every possible way. As the reviewer above I do not thing only The Light & The water (indeed thier first epic that runs over 20 min.) are good songs. I think all 4 tranks are of equally quality and all masterpieces. But no matter how good this album is, that cannot be said of all the other albums. Certainly not of the material they made after Neal Left. Too bad, Neal had to go his own way. If you like this listen to Neal's solowork, but even more to Transatlantic.
0743454537|4.0|I enjoyed this novel very much. It was a thought provoking and emotional story that dealt with a myriad of issues. It not only tugs at your heart strings, but it also causes one to examine and consider what one might do if placed in the same situation. I laughed, I cried.....

0385338686|4.0|Samantha Sweeting is on the brink of becoming a partner in one of the most prestigious law firms in London.  She didn't get to this point by accident, but rather by many long hours of overtime and by sacrificing her personal life.  Suddenly her world comes crashing down when it appears that a simple mistake on her part has cost a client a small fortune.  She blindly takes off and eventually stumbles onto a home where she knocks to ask for directions and is immediately mistaken for the new housekeeper.  At first she tries to fake her way through the job, because her domestic skills are non-existent.  She is rescued by Iris the mother Nicholas, the gardener, and soon she forms a fast friendship with the two of them.  There are a few more twists and turns before the book reaches a happy conclusion.  Although Kinsella's books are very light and are intended to amuse they also contain a message--in this case, that there is more to life than work.  Kinsella fans will enjoy this book.
B000003TAL|5.0|The above quote in the Daydream Nation liner notes sums it up quite well.  While EVOL is Sonic Youth's most cohesive album, DN is their best, especially where the use of feedback is concerned. <br /> <br />Daydream Nation basically consists of three \\"sections.\\" The first consists of the first four songs and is the most entertaining and powerful.  \\"Teen Age Riot\\" is a strong rocking opener that builds momentum into the next three songs which are the most energetic and the overall best on the album. Aptly titled \\"The Sprawl\\" is easily the best song here, beginning as a somewhat straightforward rock song and morphing into an incredible array of feedback halfway through. The guitar assault of \\"Cross The Breeze\\" is fantastic. <br />The second part of the album (containing the next four tracks) is the weakest, although still entertaining.  \\"Total Trash\\" is very impressive as it literally turns inside-out and self destructs halfway through.  \\"Providence\\" is an adventurous track that plays a message recording over an amp overheating in the background, and the result is spectacular.  <br />The final five songs end the album strongly.  The beautiful \\"Candle\\" and energetic \\"Trilogy: The Wonder\\" are both amazing songs.  \\"Trilogy: Eliminator Jr.\\" appropriately ends the 70-minute journey with a burst of energy. The only weak cut here is \\"Kissability,\\" probably the worst song on the album.   <br /> <br />Overall, this album is simply amazing.  Despite its length, it is never really boring, and the numerous masterpieces on this album more than make up for the weaker cuts like \\"Hey Joni.\\" As others have stated it is the pinnacle of Sonic Youth's career. Thanks to incredible albums like Daydream Nation, Sister, and EVOL their influence on music is undeniable.
B000E6UK32|5.0|I will always give anything Debbie Harry and Blondie does the highest rating even when the label decides to subtract tracks and DVDs off of the collections. I got the German version of the Sound & Vision :Greatest Hits collection for Christmas from my friend Roland in Holland and I actually bought a region free dvd player from my brother who works at Best Buy for Christmas so I could watch the DVD ahead of the US release. But now as Blondie becomes the first Chrysalis and who knows how long Capitol act to go into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame comes this collection. The original cd from Europe had 22 tracks and ran 79 minutes and the dvd had 17 Videos and ran around 57 minutes. The US version from Capitol removes for what unknown reason the SONGS and VIDEOS to \\"X Offender\\" and the classic \\"I'm Always Touched By Your Presence Dear\\" from the package. I am upset about this because when Capitol issued the Kylie Minogue Ultimate Kylie cd/dvd collection or the Best Shots release from Pat Benatar -- nothing was taken off either cd or DVD. So why Blondie when it was issued as a release to go with their induction of them into the Hall Of Fame. This  makes me angry that these 2 songs and videos were removed. If you have the chance to buy the European dvd version you would see the beginning of \\"X Offender\\" with Debbie talking at the beginning of the video and for \\"Presence Dear\\" video instead of the car scene from The Best Of Blondie collection you get the shot of the Double Clems that begin the video.  I do not see why they were removed. <br /> <br />  Now onto the actual US collection. This Greatest Hits is different than the 2002 Hits collection. This one uses only single mixes for the cd-- for the hits and longer tracks. NO full lp mixes for \\"Atomic\\" or \\"The Tide Is High\\". They-- like the European version put the UK and US number one tracks out front at tracks 1-7 and in order as well. \\"Heart Of Glass \\" from 1979 to \\"Maria\\" in 1999. All 7 number one tracks. Plus you also getthe classics like \\"Dreaming\\"  \\"One Way Or Another\\" and \\"Island Of Lost Souls\\" that were US top 40 singles. Plus for the first time on a US cd the FULL promo only before now 12\\" (6:06) Blow Up Mix that Sanctuary issued for \\"Good Boys\\". This is the rarest track here because it was a Promo only to Dj's mix that is now on the cd. PLUS you get a brand new version of the classic first huge hit from 1976 \\"In The Flesh\\" done electro style by Super Buddha that has worked with Scissor Sisters. PLUS the reason this cd did well in the UK-- the mash up for \\"Rapture Riders\\" that is out on UK vinyl 12\\". Done by Mark Vidler  it uses the music and beat from the original 1981 \\"Rapture\\" while mostly using the vocals to The Doors trippy \\"Riders On The Storm\\". Listen to Jim Morrison sound so incredible and at ease under the dance beat and then listen for the FULL rap of Debbie's from \\"Rapture\\". The original single mix found on the European version of this cd is only 3:46 while on the US version it is 4:04. A tiny bit longer but still not as long as the FULL VERSION (which is 5:43) on 12\\" and promo cd single. <br /> <br />  The Videos-- well from 1976 to 1982 Blondie issued 23 videos from each of their albums. So this is just a primer to when Capitol or EMI finally issue the full release of the 12 tracks of videos from Eat To The Beat. But the plus side (even though they deleated 2 of the best know Blondie videos) is that you get them without the stupid skits from The Best Of Blondie collection. Full and complete videos (although I still think that \\"Rapture \\" is from The Best Of Blondie with the beginning) BUT you do get the video that was not on the European issued DVD for \\"Rapture Riders\\" so that is a plus. Plus the \\"The Tide Is High\\" video is the US VH1 Classic version and not the original 1981 version.  <br /> <br />  So if you haven't bought the European version of this collection then it is fine to buy the US version because you will get the chance to see the videos completely butremember that Capitol cut 2 of the best videos and songs from this collection and I still have no clue as to why. A++++ again for just the fact that it is Debbie Harry and Blondie and the fact they are finally going into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame - a thing that should have happened four years ago. BUY it still.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|That's what I feel while listening to Ms. Apple's voice - it's sultry, sensual, brooding, yet still bears her trademark of sounding like she has a backbone made of stainless steel.  <br />She has the profound ability to sound vulnerable without a visible trace of wilting, yet her strength shines through in the lyrics and vocals of this album.  <br />On a more personal level I would say, if you are heartbroken and would like to find your strength, listen to this album. Listen to the profound anger, the undertones of sadness, the cynicism, yet ultimately the undertow of being a survivor. There is a nearly desperate wisdom to the lyrics. Ms. Apple's music isn't for everyone - but I feel those who love her music and her musical style will appreicate this album in particular. In my opinion it blows Tidal (another album of hers I love) away, because it goes deeper, probes the wounds, and gives them a [beautiful] voice, gives them a spine, and rhythm. In some obscure way she reminds me strangely of the late poet Anne Sexton. <br />The lyrics are strong, at times spiteful, and chilling. Accompanied with her piano as well as the strong song writing, you have yourself an album which reflects how certain situations push against us, and shows how we push back.   <br />I found nearly every song on this album to be catchy, with a good songwriting hook. The songs stick in your head. Ms. Apple is not an artist that can easily be placed in any category absolutely, and this is on of the things that I love about her. In being this way, she will grow between the cracks, and she isn't going to fade away anytime soon.
0679720200|5.0|The thoughts captured in this narration are eternal, they are not bound by space and time. The mind, when captured by the simple description of Camus, without delving into psychology and philosophy, gives a reader an adequate opportunity to build an opinion for himself. In short, this book is a spoon full of potion, which carries one to that corner of human mind, which perhaps one would never be able to experience even in imaginations, in his lifetime.
B000002I2M|5.0|They had discarded all of the elements that the later fascist punk movement had seen as proof that they were the founders of that debased sound. There's nothing of the horn sections and string sections they used to make certain numbers mainstream pop. This album featured the maturity of experience together as a real band, not the lash-up purists say chaacterizes a \\"real rock'n'roll band\\". \\"The Changeling\\" is the blues sound they had found in themselves in \\"Morrison Hotel\\". \\"Love Her Madly\\" is an uptempo track just as legit pop as \\"Touch Me\\" without all the big band baggage that cluttered that earlier hit. \\"Been Down So Long\\" could be done by any good blues singer without a sense of \\"crossover\\", as is \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\". The title track was an undeclared tribute to the Yardbirds. \\"Crawling King Snake\\" is an obvious soundtrack to the ongoing Lizard King image Morrison saw his soon-to-end life added up to. \\"WASP\\" is the Texas in Morrison as a reminder to those of us who thought him to be cliche Californian. And \\"Riders On the Storm\\" was classic noir Doors without the histrionics of earlier such material. And the band was beginning to realize that it was counterproductive to tie down Manzarek's left hand to a constant bass line, thereby making him a one-armed keyboardist. He was free to use both hands, supplemented by session men such as Jerry Scheff, father of Chicago member Jason. This album was where the Doors were settling into a creatively reliable sound. But, except for the trio albums done by the survivors, it was the last album. The next two were credible blues-rock, , they were well worth listening to, but without Jim they weren't THESE Doors. What a tragedy.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|Capitalizing on the popularity of Ray , Walk the Line also chronicles the turbulent career and life of an iconic musician, applying the same plot structure - their lives have parallel arcs and hit the same dramatic beats. Like Ray Charles, Johnny Cash struggled with substance abuse but helped beat addiction with the help from the love of a good woman. Unlike Charles, who wanted to be loved by millions, Cash became successful on his own terms, turning his back on the country music industry when they failed to support him.<br /><br />Walk the Line is a fine, return to form for director James Mangold who started his career with the independent darling, Heavy and then followed it up with the star-studded crime drama, Cop Land. He peaked with the critically lauded Girl, Interrupted and then struggled to find quality material, coasting with entertaining but otherwise forgettable films like Kate and Leopold and Identity. Walk the Line is definitely a return to meatier, more substantial material.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix is a strong actor who has been in search of the right role and has finally found it with this movie. He has been miscast in strong films (Gladiator) and been good in weak movies (Ladder 49). Walk the Line is perfectly matched with his considerable talents. It's a daunting task for any actor to play a well-known public figure and even more so for an icon like Johnny Cash. Phoenix wisely doesn't try to do an imitation of Cash, opting instead to convey the spirit of the man, capturing everything about him through the eyes.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon utilizes her adorable, plucky persona that she's cultivated for years to maximum effect as Carter, matching Phoenix's intensity and willingness to immerse herself completely in the role. Carter is the strong, moral centre on a tour filled with legendary bad boys - Cash, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. She resists the lures of the open road and constant touring - the drugs and alcohol - that Cash succumbs to and this is part of her attraction to him. It is her purity and loyalty - standing by him even when he hits absolute rock bottom -that is a large part of her appeal for him. Carter is just as stubborn as he is and sticks by him because she loves and believes in him. Phoenix and Witherspoon have great chemistry together as they play out their on again/off again romance. They compliment each other so well. Cash is wild and Carter is wholesome and it is these ying and yang qualities that they love about each other.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by co-writer/director James Mangold. He starts things off by reading the opening page of the screenplay which is a description of the opening scene to illustrate how a script is more than just dialogue and how closely what he wrote is to what we are watching. Mangold speaks eloquently about his filmmaking process, the film's themes and Cash's life, delivering a very informative track.<br /><br />Also included are ten deleted scenes with optional commentary by Mangold. There is more footage of Cash's inability to be a good salesman, more of his early days as a musician in Memphis and provides a little more insight into his first wife (Goodwin), fleshing out their turbulent relationship.bs to and this is part of her attraction to him.

B00008OE4W|4.0|Fine movie, especially if you are into gadget flicks.  For a  moive that is  14 years old, it is sill interesting and mostly believeable.

B00005JOWF|1.0|Ultraviolet<br /><br />For the past 40 years I have been hearing women complaining about movies being sexiest from the very first silent films in the 1920's to 1990.  By 1995 that fact seem to fade and this movie proves it.<br /><br />Before 1965 these movies were being referred to as sexist because they would put women on display by having them wear certain type of clothes.  Ultraviolet seems to be exposing the same as those old sexist movies did but it no longer seems to matter.  Why?  Is it because she is slaughtering men?<br /><br />Sexist?  When did the movie studios ever come out with a film with one man taking on a large group of women and he would kill every one of them?  Oh, that is sexist but \\"Ultraviolet\\" is only a movie.<br /><br />Just like \\"Kill Bill!\\"  The only time the star woman had to fight back is when she was attacking a woman.  She had no problem killing off 20 men all at once.  There was no competition.  Now that is Sexist!<br /><br />You want to see something that is sexist watch a lot of action adventure films that have been made these past ten years.  What wrong?  Can't anyone enjoy seeing a man running a sword threw a woman?  I guess not.  Every time I bring this topic up I get the same reaction.  Oh, I must enjoy seeing women get killed!  Boy, I am sick!<br /><br />Ultraviolet is supposed to be for entertainment and it is a fantasy yet it is sexist.  So, before you start thinking that I am making something out of nothing you better give this some serious thought.  Our kids are growing up on these fantasies not just in movies but also in comic books and video games.<br /><br />I will never understand why it is enjoyable to watch a woman slaughter men but it is a sexist and horrible for it to be turn around.
B00005AFVR|5.0|I have to confess: this version of 10th Ave. Freeze-Out brought tears to my eyes. And for one simple reason. I never saw a concert of The Boss and his E-Street Band. They never came to Brazil to play. \\"Oh, they are too americans\\" people say here. Oh, what a shame. Music is an universal language and, listening to Bruce's live albums (I have all the four) and watching his dance with The Big Man Clarence Clemmons, the raising of hands of all the little preeties from coastline to the city, I was really able to understand the meaning of lots of things like companionship, musicianship, harmony, communion. Well, I wish I was a Jersey native to walk down the 10th Ave just to see Scooter and Big Man singing and dancing in the streets. Rock and roll are made of these moments.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I still consider the 1995 miniseries to be THE definitive version of Pride & Prejudice.Still, this new version does have things about it I prefer to any other version. Donald Sutherland in this version I find to be the best Mr. Bennet of all versions.<br /><br />No matter what version you watch, you hear Mrs. Bennet repeatedly comment on how much prettier Jane is than Lizzy. In the '95 version Lizzy is 10 times prettier than Jane and therefore Mrs. Bennet's comments just make you scratch your head and say \\"what!?\\". The Jane in the new version is such a beauty that you can accept these comments even though you may not agree with them. The Jane in this version is also more fitting in age. The Jane in the '95 version seems to old for the part, even though Susannah Harker acted the part with perfection.<br /><br />I like the new Wickham a bit better too since in the new one he is much more handsome. Someone could indeed picture Lizzy choosing him over Darcy for looks alone and therefore could indeed be considered a threat. The Wickham in the '95 version isn't nearly as good-looking as Mr. Darcy and therefore less of a threat.<br /><br />As far as Mr. Bingley goes, I loved both the new and old '95 versions of him. Unlike most people I like the new Mr. Bingley better. He is more shy and timid in the new version and this to me makes him more endearing<br /><br />As far as comparing the 2 Lizzies, I think that Keira Knightley is every bit as a talented actress as Jennifer Ehle is in the '95 version. With that said every now and then an actor or actress comes along who was born to play a part. As much as Keanu Reeves isn't the best actor out there , he was born to play the part of Neo in The Matrix. Nobody could have done it better. I feel the same way about Jennifer Ehle in the mini series. While Miss Knightley is just as talented and did a great job in the remake, Jennifer Ehle was simply born for this part and truly embodies Lizzy. I don't think anyone could have done a better job than her.<br /><br />The same goes for Colin Firth as Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. While Matthew Macfadyen did a WONDERFUL job in the remake, Colin Firth was simply born the part. He IS Darcy.<br /><br />All-in-all as a whole there is no version that can compare to the '95 mini series, which is truly a masterpiece. Still, the new version is well worth buying and offers a refreshing take on this story. I would even go as far as saying that the new version is my favorite movie of the year !<br /><br />I rate the '95 version 10 stars out of 10 , and this new version 9 stars out of 10. Buy them both!

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I went to this show at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena back in '94 and it was the most memorable show ever.  I remember it was mixed in surround sound, and when the helicopters came overhead from behind in the segue before \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" part 2, I felt the need to duck while the choppers went by.  It was truly an \\"immersive\\" visual and aural experience.  I've seen this on laserdisc and VHS over the years but neither ever really did justice to the concert.  With this DVD release, and the remixed 5.1 sound by James Guthrie, it finally does justice to the concert.  Now my only wish is that some day an official release of \\"A Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" will make it to DVD.

0440237688|4.0|This book is a wonderful book to read to children and people of all ages. I found it interesting and very mysterious in a way. <br /> <br />The book starts off with a boy named Jonas. He lives in a sort of controlled and robotically initialized world. It is a small community, but the strange thing is that no one in that town can remember their past. I believed that they were brain washed, but that is just me.Now Jonas had turned 13 and for some strange reason he was chosen by the \\"Giver\\" himself to have a gift and that gift is to see his past. What happens after that is amazing. I rate this story 4 out of 5 stars because it was good, but there were still some parts that were misleading, but again that is in my opinion and I will let you read it for yourself.
B000056N8X|1.0|If there was a movie that you could give a negative rating to....this is one of them.  The entire highlander francshise could have taken a different turn from the first movie - which is a cult classic and spectacularly done, but no.   <br /> <br />Hollywood has to make money of it somehow.  So we end up with trash.  This movie has so many logic plot holes, and passing the torch from Lambert to Paul?  Terrible idea.  Since Paul is not really a worthy immortal.  Lambert on the other hand, played Connor Mcleod with style and panash.  Paul is just....boring.  Lets hope they do not do another sequel.

B00005JL78|5.0|The movie starts out revolving around a drug-addict Tom Cruise is the lead cop on a special type of crime force.  What this squad does is watch crimes happen before they are commited, there are 3 \\"special\\" children that can tell the futute.  How the police got their hands on em is a whole nother story.  So there is a new advisor of some sort played by Colin Ferrel, right when he enters the story, Cruise is watching a crime happen so that he can go stop it, but he sees himself committing the crime.  The movie flips the switch here and this is your warning to put your seatbelt on.<br /><br />A great movie by Spielberg where he is at his best.
B000068TPN|5.0|Based on a true story; Location; Vietnam in The valley of the death. Lt. Colonel Moore leading 400 American troopers is surrounded by 4000 North Vietnamese soldiers.<br />Amazing combat scenes, costumes and weapons with perfect graphic authenticity, making this movie stands apart from all the Vietnam movies ever filmed before.<br /><br />The casting, the dialogue and colors are amazing as well; not to forget the perfect acting of Mel Gibson and Sam Elliott.<br /><br />I have seen all the war movies about Vietnam. In my opinion, `We were soldiers' is one of the best that came so far. From all the aspect described above including the historical side, this movie is a must own to all collectors of this genre.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Great guitar, voice & rhythym are in this CD - I play it all the time!  One of my favorites
B00009L1TA|3.0|Typically popcorn thriller.  A little predictable, but nevertheless enjoyable with good performances from Jackson, typical Travolta overacting and Connie Nielsen is a little out of place playing an american captain with an exotic euro accent. <br /> <br />Good twists and turns, and fine editing.  A nice Rashoshonan type tale where the same story is told from several point of views and the audience is challenged on which side is the real truth.
B0007GAERG|4.0|I have always been a fan of Mariah Carey; however, I think that this CD is one of her best to date. \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" is one of my favorite tracks, along with \\"Circles\\". I hope that she continues to record more tracks like these. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone, and especially to Mariah Carey fans.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|I rented this along with unleashed, two for the money, saw, constant gardener, and transporter 2.  It was obviously better than transporter, but it was easily the best of the bunch.<br /><br />This movie really does nothing too special, but it is a story that we haven't seen before.  Nicholas Cage plays a gun-runner/conman.  There is no huge plot in this movie, but Nick's bro has some major issues.  His wife becomes a pretty good character even though I would have liked to see some more conversations between them.<br /><br />What this movie does do is capitilize on every oppurtunity that it had, this is not billed as a huge action thrill ride, and rightly.  The action is mainly those funny suspensful moments when you know the star is gonna figure something out to get out the stuation.  Best I've seen Nick Cage since 8 millimeter.

0064407667|5.0|When the Baudelaire Orphans, Violet, Claus, and Sunny are recently informed by Mr. Poe, a banking accountant, that their parents have just been killed by a mysterious fire, the search for a new (safe and the opposite of hostile) guardian begins. However, Count Olaf [the siblings' supposedly closest member to their parents] is exactly the opposite. With a mischevious tatoo of an eye on his left ankle, this greedy and unsympathetic infamous actor plans to steal the immense fortune left by the Baudelaire parents. The main ingredients of this takeover being a next-door-justice, acting crew (package includes two white powdered face women, a hookhanded man, a bald person who looks like neither or man or woman, and loads of other vile creatures), and hostility. Quite the intruiging read. I suggest this book to anyone who likes adventure and creepy, tall, thin men with only one eyebrow and a tatoo of an eye on his left ankle.

Which is a shame as thats what a lot of people seem to want.  I have always liked Green Day, it has been a while since I have bought an album of theirs but this one is pretty good.  There are some really good songs, and some not so good songs but at least it is inetersting and never boring and repetitive.  I felt it was worth while to listent to, listen to the samples and if you like the style buy it.

B00005JOFO|5.0|I rarely watch the Oscars because the show is too drawn out.  I made an effort to see it last night because I wanted to see history being made with Brokeback winning best film.  Needless to say, I was totally disgusted.   <br /> <br />It's not so much that Brokeback lost, than it is for the obvious reason it lost.  It lost due to prejudice.   <br /> <br />Everyone knows that prior to the Oscars, Brokeback won every best picture award available, except one.  Just one.  There must have been upwards of a dozen wins.  If Crash was as good a film, or better, wouldn't one expect that IT would have won some of those awards along the way?  It won only ONE...  <br /> <br />Add to that bit of reasoning the reports that many of the academy voters didn't even want to see the film due to the content.  Well, even if they did eventually see it, that stated desire to not see it defines a prejudice that would prevent them from voting for it no matter how good it was.  <br /> <br />To me it's incredible that they would even voice such an opinon.   <br /> <br />I don't care that Brokeback Mountain lost if people really felt another film was better.  I care that, based on all the awards won, Brokeback was obviously the better film, and lost because of personal prejudices.  <br /> <br />Any voter who voices a desire to NOT review any film nominated for Best Picture should be dismissed.  They have no business being a voter on the academy if they can't watch the films nominated, even a gay themed film.  Voicing their desire to not even see the film was shameful.   <br /> <br />I lost a lot of respect for the Academy.  I doubt very much I'll want to watch the show again.  There just comes a time when enough is enough.  It's bad enough that we have to face all the prejudices we do in this country without having the Academy boast on one hand about making and supporting movies that advance social justice and equality, while then passing up the opportunity to choose the best film that is doingjust that - all because of their own prejudices.   <br /> <br />Today, homophobia is a far greater societal evil than racism.  Only radical fringe groups such as the Aryans and the KKK would do harm to racial minorities... and they are not supported by mainstream America at all...   But mainstream America - the church going hypocrites they are (mostly), still think it's perfectly okay to be as nasty and cruel to us as they can be (be it personal or societal).  And they justify their actions by the same Bible that promotes slavery, and the subjugation of women.  As I said.. Hypocrites.   <br /> <br />The academy had a chance to pick the best film, and send a very needed message.  The film will do wonders anyhow, and as time goes on, Brokeback will be the one film remembered most for 2005...  <br /> <br />For those of us who love the beauty of this film, at least we'll always have that..
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|First off, the casting: Keira Knightley was a good choice for Elizabeth Bennet. She would not have been my first choice after the lovely job by Jennifer Ehle in A&E/BBC's 1995 version, but Keira played the part very well and I believed in her Elizabeth from start to finish! Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy: all I can say is WOW! MacFadyen is a relative unknown (I know him only as the gambling loser Felix Carbury in Trollope's \\"The Way We Live Now\\"): his portrayal was passionate, gritty, determined, loveable, heartfelt and moving: I was completely convinced and fell in love (as other Colin Firth fans will likely do so shortly). Added to these two top-notch choices is some other great talent: Rosamund Pike (Lady Harriet Cumnor in \\"Wives & Daughters\\") as Jane Bennet, Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet, Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet, Tom Hollander (Osborne Hamley in \\"Wives & Daughters\\") as Mr. Collins, and Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourg: the only somewhat puzzling choices were Rupert Friend as Mr. Wickham and Simon Woods as Mr. Bingley...they seemed to make Mr. Bingley's character incredibly nave and almost silly in this film (which I must admit, did add some nice comic relief), whereas the 1995 P&P chooses to make him only too apt to believe the best in everyone too easily influenced by others. Mr Wickham was only slightly likeable to me, and was not given enough screen time for us to truly believe why Elizabeth defended him so much to Darcy. The cast was rounded out with Jena Malone as Lydia Bennet, Talulah Riley as Mary Bennet, and Carey Mulligan as Kitty Bennet, as well as a few others.  <br /> <br />The overall storyline and feel: I thought they did an excellent job condensing the storyline into a theatrical movie-length version. I was mighty impressed with the screenwriter, and was not surprised to find out that Emma Thompson (who wrote the screenplay for 1995's \\"Sense & Sensibility\\", as well as giving an Oscar-winning performance as Elinor Dashwood) did an un-credited and unpaid rewrite of the new \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" script: she is given a special thanks in the end credits. The cinematography of the film was well done, with gorgeous scenes and imagery created: the soundtrack score is excellent, soft and unassuming, but seems to blend perfectly with the film: highly recommended. There is little that I would like to change overall: a few content issues (as described below), and otherwise, my changes would be: 1) the final scene: it is a bit too modern-feeling, and not true to Jane Austen as it should be 2) one scene where Lizzie reads a letter: she is upset & crying, only I thought it felt a bit stilted and not quite credible 3) Lady Catherine's speech to Elizabeth: I felt it could have been stronger, and have more \\"umph\\" behind it. Set design and costumes: the costumes work perfectly with the mood and feel of the film: at first I was a bit disappointed that they put Elizabeth in so much brown, but it works very well with the grit and feel of the film (and makes it seem much more real), and there are times (like at the Netherfield Ball), when you get some gorgeous white & light-colored costumes on the characters (including a beautiful snow-white dress on Elizabeth, with a lovely upswept hairdo). I thought the set design was very well done, and loved the very realistic feel of the film: the comparison between the Bennet house and Pemberly is quite drastic and added to the credibility of Darcy's wealth.  <br /> <br />For those of you interested in \\"family-friendly\\" remarks, read this paragraph, otherwise you can skip to the next one. Content: There is one scene with a character walking through a room full of white, marble statues, mostly nude, and admiring them: mostly the shots show behinds, though some naked breasts are shown as well in a ceiling painting. There is one use of a*s, and little else in the way of language. There is some dialogue that alludes to the fact that an unmarried man & woman ran off together, not necessarily with any plans to get married, but it is eventually resolved; there is some cleavage shown, but nothing too drastic. All in all, the content is kept to a minimum.  <br /> <br />This beautifully-filmed and well-acted movie is well worth the time & effort of going to the movie theatre, in a day and age when there is often little that does such. The romance they created in a few scenes was, I felt, beyond compare. For those of you who loved & enjoyed A&E and BBC's 1995 version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you are in for a treat: there are enough differences in the movies to make them both loveable, but enough similarities in dialogue that you don't feel you are missing anything. This new film & soundtrack is highly recommended (I bought the soundtrack from Amazon UK a month ago, as it is being released Nov 15th in the USA): this movie will also end up being a must-add to any woman's DVD collection!!  <br />
B0002858YS|3.0|This ablum is great... for the first 5 songs.  You know them, you love them, they are all hit singles.  Too bad the next 6 haven't managed to squeak there way into my rotation yet.  I find my self clicking next next next through them.  This would make a great tape back in the day, I would have called it a one sider... with the second side never seeing the light of day.  But the songs for which you are likely looking at this CD for were enough to convince me to buy it, rather than hope for a one day greatest hits compilation.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is a Romantic's dream film. With all the beauty of the Old English lifestyles, mannerisms, and the rewarding ending where the right person gets married to the right person, this film will satisfy your longings and yearnings in waiting for the right person to come along for you. This movie allows you to get lost in the bygone years of Englands glory, and it feeds your desire to visit the Motherland, and to partake of it's quaint villages. The cast of characters were beautifully suited for each other, and the realism of the friendships and not so good friendships, made it seem like something very familiar to our own lives. I would recommend this film to those who are happily married or to those who long to be married to the right Mate.
B00003CWL6|4.0|American Beauty is a complex film that moves in difficult territory with mixed results.  I admired and enjoyed many things about it, particularly the acting, cinematography and editing, along with some of the sharp humor.  However, there are some important parts that seem on reflection not to fit together or just not to work, and there is one key thread that's particularly ugly.<br /><br />Right at the start, Lester (Spacey) tells us he will soon be dead.  He appears to be a typical middle American in suburbia, with a wife and teenaged daughter, and the basic ingredients of the American Dream.  Under this surface is a seething anger and bitter unhappiness; the whole family is miserable.  Lester already feels dead inside.<br /><br />In the bottom of this mid-life trench Lester suddenly finds himself awakened to life, at least in his fantasies, by a roughly 16-year-old girl, his daughter's friend.  (There are references to Lolita throughout the film.)  This acts as a catalyst for a full retreat into an adolescent state of mind in which he feels reconnected and vital, more or less.  He quits his white-collar job, blackmails his former employer, gets a job at a burger joint, buys the 1970 Firebird he always wanted, and fantasizes about the high school girl.  When he finally arrives at the consummation of his fantasy, a shock brings him to a new state of mind.  There are also a couple subplots that come together at the end.<br /><br />The title and the generic suburban setting suggest that Lester and his family are representative of middle America, and Lester himself says he's just an ordinary guy.  If so, it's according to a very cynical view.  The film seems to be shaped, and deformed, by an overall cynicism, despite what appear to be genuine efforts to show compassion, moral development and even happiness.  There is an epilogue that seems sincere, beautiful and optimistic, but either it doesn't fit with the rest of the film or it too is cynical.<br /><br />The epilogue is beautifully presented, but dramatically it's curiously undermined, made ironic, commented on, or at least brought into question by cuts to the denouement of a bloody whodunit subplot.  The epilogue is also phrased in a self-negating way: \\"gratitude\\" and \\"stupid little life\\" are incongruously joined in one sentence.  Its sudden bliss, taken at face value, seems to negate the significance of the suffering shown through the rest of the film, as though some kind of nirvana has magically resulted.  And the final thought in the epilogue is hard to take seriously in the context of the film as a whole: that we'll all know exactly what the epilogue refers to someday (when we die).  Do the filmmakers really believe that?  Or is this part of the dark humor--the epilogue is no more real than the appearance of happiness for Lester's family was at the beginning?<br /><br />Or, as seems most likely to me, is the ending confused because the conflict between the cynicism and efforts at something better, and possibly the need for a more Hollywood ending, has mixed things up?<br /><br />The script actually began as a story about the real-life Amy Fisher, the \\"Long Island Lolita\\" who tried to kill her lover's wife.  The finished script was very different, but it was still framed by prison scenes and a murder trial.  After filming was complete the director changed that and other key points.  The DVD commentary by the director and the writer is remarkable for the way the director does almost all the talking.  At the end, the writer says he's found the director's comments very enlightening, that he never knew that was the director's intent, but that it all makes perfect sense.  It doesn't.<br /><br />No doubt some of the confusion of the film comes from the tortured process by which it went from one plot to a very different one, even at the last minute.  My hunch is that the director was trying to keep the film from being so negative that audiences would reject it.  He says he triedto keep Lester on the edge of what the audience could accept.  Reportedly, the script had him further over that edge.  It's no wonder the writer was so quiet about the end result.  The oddly presented and seemingly self-negating epilogue appears to sum up the competing forces that collided in the making of the film and were never quite harmonized.<br /><br />Despite the visual beauty of the film, it fails to be profound about beauty where it seems to try hardest.  A major theme is finding beauty in unexpected places, including death.  This isn't a profound truth as presented.  We seem to be asked to take seriously the idea that the dead have a special beauty akin to glimpsing God, but all we see in the main example, Lester himself dead, is the graphic quality of a \\"still life\\" (admired in the commentary as \\"like a painting\\"), along with an awed reaction shot.  Any beauty in that is no different than that of a bowl of fruit, and is a very superficial way to view the death of a man.  Maybe it's the bliss of the epilogue that's supposed to be glimpsed in the dead but, again, the epilogue is hard to fit with the film overall, and even with itself.<br /><br />*Spoiler alert,* for this paragraph only.  (You might be able to guess some points from the following, though I won't actually say what they are, and you may still be surprised.)  To me, a particularly unpleasant aspect of the film has to do with the way Lester's relation with the the young object of his fantasies is presented.  Without giving anything away directly, what Lester does is treated as acceptable and harmless.  In the commentary, the director says Lester didn't abuse the girl, that he was gentle, that she could have said no, and that's the attitude reflected in the film.  She's about 16; Lester's over twice that.  No matter how experienced she could have been, how gentle he was, whether she said yes or no or nothing at all, and no matter how it all finally ended up, what Lester did was still inexcusable because of the vast difference in maturity and power.  It's a complex issue, but this kind of thing is far from harmless and seeing it treated as harmless in a graphic way, and excusing it for the reasons given, is ugly.  (The novel Lolita doesn't make the same mistake.)<br /><br />The film remains interesting not only despite its flaws but in part because of them.  The attempt to deal with its themes and bring them together in a satisfying way sharpens some questions even when it appears to fail.  Does Lester really become happy in his fantasies?  Are his fantasies beautiful or pathetic (there's a fair amount of evidence that the latter was intended, that the \\"beauty\\" was ironic).  What did Lester arrive at before he died (and why didn't the film develop that, cutting it off immediately)?  Is it possible to harmonize the things the film seems to try to bring together?cept.

B000BGH22W|4.0|Stuart Cassells is very different from the acclaimed and brilliant John Williams, but the music is good!  I like the Hogwarts March and, contrary to the review above, the music was very memorable.  Cassells's music does not carry the momentum that Williams does, but then, Cassells can't stray far from the music John Williams had already set as the theme of Harry Potter.  THe CD is a... good buy, nothing more.  If you enjoy or collect the Harry Potter CD's, then you should have this one, although I would suggest that you buy singles if you are not a great fan.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|i have to agree, Brokeback got robbed at the oscars. this is definently one of the biggest upsets like when Shakespear in Love won over the excpected Saving Private Ryan. why the film lost i can speculate is because of prejudice, theme, and all the late night jokes about it (have you seen comedy central when it came out?) i guess the academy wasent ready for a film adressing the gay theme to take home the most prestigous film award but we can look at the bright side, in a year or two we will forget about the Crash victory but Brokeback will only gain in popularity and it will become a classic like other robbed oscar films. the film has a sad tone in it and when it shows pictures of happiness its just heartbreaking. the film is about two ranchers, Ennis and Jack, who meet one summer tending sheep in the wilderness of Brokeback Mountain and by fate, fall in love. then as time goes buy they get married, have kids, but still always meet at the mountain to rekindle there love. all the performences are great, Gyllenhaal gives his best performence since the Good Girl while Hathaway comes far since her Princess diaries days. but the two standout performces are Ledger and Williams. Ledger perfectly brings a gruff, quiet Ennis to the screen with explosive results and Williams has blossomed into a pitch perfect actress potraying Ennis's tortured wife and proves she has come a long way since Dawson's creek. i have loved Ang Lee's films from Sense and Sensibilty to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but this by far is his best film to date, i wont give away the ending but i will say the shirt...just makes you want to cry. some people may shy away from the film but its a great film so i definently recomend seeing it. it is truley the best film of the year.
B000E8QVWY|2.0|I cannot fathom why Joaquin Phoenix did not win the Oscar for best actor for his role in this film. He did an amazing job capturing the personae and the sound of the late Mr. Cash. While I like Reese Witherspoon in the Legally Blonde series to me she looks like a high school girl who likes to play dress-up in all of her films and this one was no exception. Johnny Cash was complex and driven by many demons as this film shows. I did not feel that the onscreen chemistry between Phoenix and Witherspoon revealed the true nature of this great love affair.
0446577383|1.0|When I saw this book I was excited to read it, but I hadn't read any reviews, I wish I would have I could have saved some cash.<br /><br />If you are an ultra left wing liberal who is hoping Howard Dean will run for President again--this is the book for you.<br /><br />However, reasonable people with some background about the war on terror and Islam, will be downright angry with the liberal propanganda that this author \\"preaches\\" through his Muslim characters.<br /><br />If you are of the Jewish faith, you will be EXTREMELY disappointed as the voice of thousands of murdered Israelis is non-exisent in this book.  Aparantenly if the Imperialist West would just remove itself from the mid-east most Muslims want peace with Judaism and want to work side by side with Israel, I guess the venom spewed by muslims calling for the total annihilation of all jews is more Western Imerpialist propaganda.  Also, when the female muslim character (the nanny) goes on about how she respects jews and eats kosher jewish food, I almost gagged, again more pro-Islam crap. I have many Jewish family members in Israel and America, they would beg to differ with this author.<br /><br />As the wife of a military officier and the daughter of a Marine I am particularly disturbed at the portrayal of the U.S. Military.  National Guardsmen who are serving overseas are apparently being dragged \\"kicking and screaming\\" to serve their country, and those who volunteer to serve are merely the brainwashed tools of American Imperialists.<br /><br />And of course the secret agents risking their lives preventing more 9/11 attacks are the worst of them all, they are mindless killers who can be sold to the highest bidder.<br /><br />It seems that this author feels Arab terrorists are to be pitied and understood, America is really to blame for jihad and we should ask these terrorists for forgiveness.  This \\"blame America first\\" attitude is saturated in every page of this book telling readers to be introspective and ask \\"what have we done to deserve these homicide bombings, slaying of innocent women and children, and public be-headings?\\" If you agree, again this is the book for you.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the ending, but I think the author should have included world leaders coming together at the UN holding hands singing 'kumbaya' it would have been more realistic. Give me a break!<br /><br />If you must read this book save your money and check this book out at the library, even if you enjoy some good old fashioned left-wing propaganda exposing the domination of the US Industrial-military-complex, this book is just too unbelievable and the characters too predictable--but then again it may just be the perfect book for a left-wing extremist.ask \\"what have we done to deserve these homicide bombings, slaying of innocent women and children, and public be-headings?\\" If you agree, again this is the book for you.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the ending, but I think the author should have included world leaders coming together at the UN holding hands singing 'kumbaya' it would have been more realistic.

B000784WMW|5.0|I have been in love with this Jane Eyre \\"miniseries\\" for years. Glad to see it on DVD now. Timothy Dalton is the perfect Rochester--he literally channels the character. Sure he gorgeous and in the book Rochester is not as handsome, but he is all Rochester in every other way. Zelah Clarke makes a great Jane.<br /><br />I have seen several other versions of \\"Jane Eyre\\", and most have something special to offer. The George C. Scott portrayal of Rochester was spot on, but Susanna York was way too beautiful and mature to play the young Jane.(Jane was not played by George's real life wife, Trish Van Devere, as one of the reviewers mentioned.) And it was much too short and edited down. The main music theme was haunting and beautiful. (Would like to find the soundtrack of it, if it exists.) The William Hurt version was forgettable. Both leads were miscast. The Ciaran Hinds film was ok, but I still didn't really get him as Edward. I can't even remember the actress who played Jane. And I vaguely remember an Orson Welles version. As I recall, he seemed to be a fairly good Rochester, but that movie version was not otherwise memorable.<br /><br />So, what I am saying here is that if you want to really know the Jane Eyre story, this is the one to get. It is nearly perfect.

B0000C24GD|3.0|This is essentially a buddy movie clothed in mountaineering garb. It is a story about two climbers: one, a Seattle based attorney, the other, a physics instructor. They are a mismatched pair of friends who are brought together because of their love for climbing. The story line is about the ultimate test that their friendship endures while high on K2, the second highest mountain in the world but the most perilous to climb.<br /><br />The rock climbing scenes that take place in the first fifteen minutes of the movie are terrific to watch, even though they may not be technically correct. After all, it's a movie, not a documentary. The scenery is spectacular and the cinematography is excellent.<br /><br />These friends decide to grab an opportunity to climb K2 with an expedition that lost two of its team members to an avalanche on Denali. The attorney has no problem going to K2, but the physics instructor leaves behind his weeping wife and child. Yet his friendship with the attorney and his own desire to climb K2 compel him to leave his distraught family.<br /><br />There are a number of scenes in the movie that seem to be taken from real life. While on expedition to K2, the porters leave them stranded, refusing to go any further on the mountain, as they have portents of doom. They also want more money. One scene has the attorney burning rupees in defiance of the porters' strike. World class mountaineer Jim Wickwire did the same thing, when he climbed K2, and under similar circumstances.<br /><br />In another scene, a number of climbers fall into a crevasse only to be saved at the last minute by the physics instructor, as he digs his ice axes in and grips the road. The film also include a scene that shows the expedition leader succumbing to high altitude sickness, necessitating his descent of K2 as soon as possible.<br /><br />Animosity on the mountain between the climbing leader and the attorney over who will be part of the first summit team is also reminiscent of real life expeditions. It is here that the attorney's friendship with the physics instructor becomes strained, as he lays claim to be on the first summit team and does not include his friend, even though they had been climbing partners for ten years. So much for the brotherhood of the rope.<br /><br />After the first summit team is finished off by the mountain, the two friends summit, but on the descent the physics instructor falls and is seriously injured, breaking his leg. As you can imagine, this is really bad news, as it is tantamount to a death sentence, especially when you are in the death zone and without oxygen.<br /><br />Since this is a buddy movie, the attorney comes up with a plan to get his friend down K2. I won't tell you what it is, but I will give you a hint. The plan used is to be found in Joe Simpson's book \\"Touching the Void\\".<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the movie is dedicated to two mountaineers of renown: Seattle attorney, Jim Wickwire, and physicist, Lou Reichardt, both of whom were among the first Americans to summit K2 in 1978. This film seems to be loosely based upon some of their mountaineering exploits. It is a moderately enjoyable film that should appeal to armchair climbing enthusiasts everywhere.life expeditions.

It is obvious that he has a deep love of that city.  But the narative is so poorly written that it is distracting.  It is too bad, because it is a compelling story.  For such a large book it reads very quickly and I stuck with it mostly because I wanted to know what happened next.  He does have some passages of brilliant prose, but they are few and very far between.  When I was done with the book I found myself actually hoping that the movie will be better than the book, which with the right music and good acting it very well could be.

B000BBOUU4|2.0|...and I honestly don't get it! This meaning, of course, that I don't understand why the critics didn't seem to come up with worthy enough words to praise this new masterpiece signed a certain Tim Burton. At least the critics over here in Europe did, and after finally watching it (with a mixed expectation being that very often critics have no idea what they are talking about -funny how they mostly agree amongst themselves, isn't it? If a movie is weird enough it's a bit scary being the one who doesn't \\"get it\\", am I right?).     And yes, this movie is weird enough -but it doesn't seem forced, and is not the problem at all. And I don't give a damn about the similarities between Willie Wonka and Michael Jackson! Ironically at first viewing it was like being served a big and tempting bowl of candy -but it didn't taste anything. The gigantic chocolate-factory stands there in all its' mystery containing all its' secrets, but when we're finally inside every room looks the same. It's been a while since I read the book (but I did recognize myself there from time to time), so my dissapointment has got nothing to do wether it is true to the original story or not -but I simply didn't find it amusing, and after finnishing the bowl I still want candy. Ok, enough with the candy -but how this movie has scored full pot with the critics is beyond me. It's ok at its' best, and I can swallow a child loving it of course -it's colorful, and at times like watching a childrens' show. But at the same time it's a comedy for adults as well, and somehow falls between two chairs.     I must admit that my two stars on the other hand goes to Johnny Depp. He certainly \\"becomes\\" Willie Wonka, or the oposite that is. He was a pleasure to watch -and overall the movie is saved by good acting from the entire cast. It's the story itself I found flat as its' original script -and far, far overrated. It has its' moments I guess, but nothing remembarable. All the praise of amazing effects, well, I didn't notice anything special. And good and \\"believable\\" effects aren't everything (or haven't we learned?).    Christopher Lee is wasted on a completely non-fit father/son-scenario switching between present/past (similar to other Burton-productions like \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" there with the main character and his mother), and is totally unecassarry -and ruined at least a desent ending. Over the top if you ask me! It just didn't make any sence at all -even for an fabled adventure-story...    So sorry, Tim Burton, I'm usually a big fan of you -but you can do better than this!
B0007CNXUK|5.0|When I saw the previews for Finding Neverland I was very sure it was just a new addition to the many remakes of Peter Pan but I made the mistake of judging it. Of course like a lot of people my attention was directed to the film more because of Johnny Depp but it wasn't enough for me to hit the theatre. You soon find out that Johnny is enough and he hit's his amazing character right on point. The film may seem a little slow or boring to some but the story is so interesting that you can't turn it off.<br /><br />In the previews you don't really don't get that the film is about the author of Peter Pan and how he created the play and not Pan itself and this becomes a rope that pulls you in. When you see how beautiful the mind of J.M. Barrie you want nothing more then to see how Pans story begins. To be honest this film is almost better than watching any Peter Pan film because it tells the story of the creator and the children that are Peter Pan and his friends but in reality they are real people.
0312335164|3.0|Dan Brown's writing style has a way of capturing his audience's attention with page-turning excitement in short, condensed chapters. It's great to see an author create a writing style they're comfortable with and stick with it. As a fan of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and its prequel \\"Angels and Demons,\\" I was a little underwhelmed with \\"Digital Fortress.\\" It's a disadvantage to compare it to \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" yet reading them less than a few months apart, I couldn't help but think while reading \\"Digital Fortress\\" that Brown has increasingly improved his writing style in only a few short years. The book itself is a good thriller that will keep you entertained as the characters race to solve a code that could destroy the American ecosystem.  The characters such as Susan Fletcher, the NSA cryptographer, are relatable as they try to literally save the world. My main complaint is that the explanation of the TRANSLTR and the encrypted codes are a little vague as it is hard to understand, for a common audience, exactly what is going on. However, as mentioned before, the book is good, but I'm glad that Dan Brown was able to improve on this book.

There is no aggression on this album; no feeling. I understand the need to evolve, but this is a radical change and it barely resembles the Metallica some of us grew up with. I see reviews hailing this as a great HARD ROCK album and therein lies the problem. This is barely a metal CD; the only reason it was, or is considered metal is because it was released by Metallica (and because MTV tells you that its metal).<br /><br />Maybe they should have changed their name to Acoustica or Selloutaca.<br /><br />I never liked this album. I despised it when it was released and I despise it to this day. I refuse to support this band in any way. As for me, I will go listen to some real metal.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|This album is a tour de force of musical styles, instrumentation and arrangements. Most importantly, it is totally fresh and original and does not sound like anything else (except other work from Stevens). I can't stop listening to it because each time I hear something new and interesting. On top of that, it manages to balance a unique view of the state and its history with lyrics that are also personal and compelling.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Well, First let me start of by saying that I live in Western NC close to the Appalachian Mountains and growing up here you tend to hear alot of bluegrass music & my generation I think tries to rebel from the music because of stereotypes...I am in my early 20's and listen to alot of rock bands such as Nirvana & Led Zeppelin..When I first heard this cd I was blown away!! I heard of AKUS before but never sat and listned to their music and I regret it!! I am a huge fan & I have turned plenty more into fans...this Live cd is a great place to start...please buy this cd now!!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|AOR is like running  water, once it starts nothing can stop it. we ride the universe by \\"judas is rising\\" and we enter the new incredible world by \\"Hell rider and Lochness\\"  these musics can only be created  and  only be  advenced by JUDAS PRIEST. I am looking forwward to releasing the new album.
0385338082|4.0|I enjoyed \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\" much more than I did some of Sophie Kinsella's other books. The plot is funny and I found myself laughing out loud of many times. I would suggest this book as a nice beach read or something to read when you want to relax and laugh a little.

B00005JO04|3.0|Before I had seen it, this film had really taken my interest. Unfortunatly, it didnt quite come to the standards I was expecting. At first, it does present a good cast with great performances(especially from Clooney), but the film didnt contain anything to get me fully focused on. The story moves in many directions that seems to be a little problem, which may cause viewers to seem a little lost. The many storylines seem a lot to follow, jumping from one to another. It feels like a strong, tense thriller with great realism throughout but doesnt seem to have much thrills or tension it should have. It may be a difficult film to follow and quite clear that its not a film for everyone, but Syriana is a well directed film nonetheless, that is clearly noticed through its endings, and well deserves some respect.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|this album is personified by title -- that is, it's DG's most personal work, on an island, if you will. the atmosphere is extremely calm, unpretentious, mellow, and haunting. 5 listens in, and it's already my favorite album of the year. what some are failing to understand is that this is a solo album -- it's not PF. i'd actually give this 4 stars, but there needs to be a certain balance to the knee-jerk \\"this ain't floyd!\\" mentality. and a good day to you, kind sirs.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|1983 The Final Cut was released. A Pink Floyd album in name but a Roger Waters solo album in reality.  Sure Gilmour played on every song but one, as did Nick Mason, but Waters contributed all the songs, which were deeply personal, and dominated the sessions to the degree that MAson and Gilmour would barely show up at all. Rooted in Waters' loss of his father in 1944 to the ravages of World War II, the album, which now includes \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\" , is Waters' swan song as de facto leader and member of Pink Floyd.  It was his own true Final Cut for the band.<br /><br />And so, 23 years and two Pink Floyd studio albums later, \\"On An Island\\" is David Gilmour's goodbye to the band (or project as the case has been) he struggled so hard to retain the right to keep aloft after Waters' turbulent split.  And as a farewell, it couldn't be any further from The Final Cut than Gilmour is to Roger Waters himself.<br /><br />Where Final Cut is distraught, emotionally raw, vitriolic, political, and lyrically dense, Gilmour's new album is lush, at ease with itself, melodic, in love, accessible.  There are tunes that could have been on Obscured By Clouds or Meddle (\\"The Blue\\"), motifs that have appeared before on Wish You Were Here (especially Gilmour's sax debut \\"Red Sky At Night\\" which is essentially a translation to woodwind of his monumental intro to \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\") and sounds we've never heard from Gilmour (The cumbus intro to \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\", a variation of Fleetwood Mac's influential \\"Albatross\\").  Where Waters' lyrical dexterity ruled the shape of Final Cut, it's Gilmour's innate feel for space and aural sensuality captained by his still muscular, albeit less ginger, guitar solos that steers On An Island through its self sure, rolling cycle.<br /><br />That's not to say that the album is perfect. It's very nearly great.  I prefer the radio edit of the title track, and would like to have had a shortened version of \\"The Blue\\" --too much of a good thing with a lengthy guitar solo section at the end--.  And the weakest track is perhaps the most directand personal, \\"Where We Start\\", the closing track for which Gilmour penned all the lyrics and played all the instruments save the drums (Andy Newmark, who played on Waters' PROS AND CONS OF HITCHHIKING and on \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" from Final Cut) but it lacks his presence or focussed attention in some weird way.<br /><br />To conclude, for those looking for the anger and somewhat emotionally derailed narrative of latter day Waters-era Floyd, pick up the Final Cut.  But if you're looking for a satisfying musical sail featuring the main voice (in better shape than Division Bell by a long shot), guitar, and I contend, sonic heart of Pink Floyd, \\"On An Island\\" will thrill you.good thing with a lengthy guitar solo section at the end--.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|I've listened to this twice and my first impression is this: it's one of the best solo pink floyd albums to date. Like many have said before, it is pretty mellow and sounds very similar to meddle in a lot of respects. That is definately not a bad thing! I'm guessing it will be to the people who think Pink Floyd is solely dark side of the moon and wish you were here. Great guitar solos and excellent vocals .. overall 4 and a half stars.
B000BO0LLS|3.0|Briefly, without intention of offending nor even Mariah herself, a lot of people I know fan from her too, think the same: Hope She Returns To Be Mariah, the one from Vision of Love, and let their people around who just want to make money on her and if she takes those waves, she'll becoming a star easy to reach when she knows she has Platnum Voice to do what she wished. Selling records could be more if she would maintain the same styles, those new songs from Rainbow til the newest, are just meal to the Hip Hop followers, but it's not Mariah's way, B. Streisand has done different things singing, but she is still Barbra, why don't you Mariah!? You could be singing with her too as the BEST that you used to be! Just prove to be the same with new songs, not pretend selling what the most do, that's just a time nobody will remember as the years you were the ONLY n' ONE! <br />Love YOU, <br />Pedro Manuel Caminero (CUBA) with a lot of friends fan of you!
B000EGDC0A|5.0|One of my favourite albums of last year was Goldfrapp's incredible third album \\"Supernature.\\" Released in August 2005, the album stormed to No.2 in the UK album charts and has since gone platinum and spawned a slew of chart hits. The album was originally intended to be released in America soon after, but this release date got postponed until March 2006! That means I've been waiting seven months to review this absolute little beauty of electro-glam pop-rock. With the release of this album Goldfrapp have gone on to become one of the most loved and treasured bands in the UK, and their incredible rise in popularity was well deserved.<br /><br />On this album, Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory took all the elements of their sophomore \\"Black Cherry\\" and re-energised it into this wonderful and high-speed concoction of disco pop wizardry. The sound of Goldfrapp has gradually evolved, becoming more commercial with each stunning album. Some say they've sold out, but I disagree. It's only natural for a band of Goldfrapp's calibre to expand and widen their horizons. They were already critics darlings from the word go, and it was only a matter of time before the general public caught on. Hopefully this album will push Goldfrapp into the stratosphere and onto the upper reaches of the Billboard Hot 100. However, with singers like James Blunt currently occupying the No.1 spot, I won't hold my breath.<br /><br />The album opens with the lead single, \\"Ooh La La.\\" This song became a huge chart smash in August 2005, peaking at No.4 on the UK charts. The song was used in adverts and promos, became a mainstay on national radio and seemed to be played on music channels every other minute. The beat to this song bubbles with an electric buzz that is pure Goldfrapp. The guitars are wonderfully, Alison's vocals dripping with sex and vigour. The instrumental section in the middle is an all-out riot and I go crazy in clubs dancing to that particular piece! \\"Lovely 2 C U\\" is another brilliant song that leads on where the last left off. This song is almost rocky with heavy screaming vocals and guitars that surge through your ears like a steam train. The electro-crunches make this song so unique, but it pales in comparison to the beauty that follows. The song is \\"Ride A White Horse,\\" the third single to be released from the album. Opening with a funky beat, the song soon morphs into a glitter-ball aural wonderland with bright synths colouring the musical canvas and Alison's breathy vocals lifting the chorus to levels of beauty unmatched by the band previously. This could well be the pinnacle of the band's career. It's very camp and metro, made all the more evident by the whip-cracks just before the second chorus explodes. It's clocked up more than 130 plays on my iTunes and this number will only grow higher and higher!<br /><br />\\"You Never Know\\" opens with screechy early Kate Bush vocals, although not quite as operatic. This song is memorable for its stop-start technique that works very well. It reminds me somewhat of a blend of \\"Tiptoe\\" and \\"Hairy Trees\\" from the previous album. The beat is wonderful and builds until a high climax of airy musical excellence. \\"Let It Take You\\" is the album's main slow song and what a song it is. This is a chance for you to kick back and relax to the gorgeous Bond-style strings that seep out slowly over Alison's seductive vocal stylings. The strings build to an expansive height at the third minute and there's a sense of release which is almost erotic. The strings are pretty heavy all the way through and pound over and over like a bell chiming to your soul. If this song were a colour it would be black, with occasional swathes of white.<br /><br />\\"Fly Me Away\\" is a step down from the previous songs, but it's still a catchy pop song with a strong beat and vocal melody. The lyrics aren't up to much and Goldfrapp have definitely done a lot better, but it still works in context with the album and somehow makes me feel like I'm flying. \\"Slide In\\" is a very suggestive title for such a brilliant song. The beat starts off and soon spirals down as synths seem to drive in from every angle. This builds with breathy vocals up until the 37th second when this *incredible* beat just hits you and will have you up dancing in no time. The way its formed is just pure genius and it hits me like a hammer to the head every time I hear it. The chorus is chunky and bulky with more electro dance sonics for you to feast on than you could ever hope for.<br /><br />\\"Koko\\" is another incredible song which I adore purely for the vocal melody. It opens beautifully with at-first indecipherable vocal lines from Alison, which soon become clearer as she sings, \\"Breathe! Back! Into Life! Stabs! Of! Happiness! Now! We're! Having Fun! Hold! Tight! Don't Look Down 'Til Dawn! You Glow!\\" It's absolutely wonderful and her vocal tone suggests pure ecstasy. \\"Satin Chic\\" is viewed by many to be one of the best songs on the album, but I can't see it! Hinted to be the album's fourth single, this song is a fusion of pop, rock and cabaret, but I've never clicked with it. \\"Time Out From This World\\" is the second of only two really slow and relaxing songs on the album. It's more akin to something you'd have found on \\"Felt Mountain,\\" and has a beautiful chorus that reminds me of standing on top of a mountain. The album ends with the static \\"Number 1.\\" This was the second single to be lifted from the album back in late 2005 and peaked at No.9 in the UK charts. The electro-ness of this song is gorgeous and startling with an achingly beautiful verse structure. The point at 1:16 where the melody becomes louder and more obvious is a revelation and will have you humming for life!<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Goldfrapp really struck gold with this album winning critical and commercial acclaim from the most varied of sources. I have been playing this album non-stop for nearly eight months now along with the band's previous two albums and I just can't see any reason for not continuing. The band have been criticised by some for being bland and unoriginal, which I just laugh at. Goldfrapp are anything but unoriginal. There's people imitating their sound, yes, and Goldfrapp have been influenced by a lot of music from the 1970s and 1980s, yes, but there's no one else out there doing it better. There's moments of pure pop genius electricity on this album, and that's why I predict Goldfrapp will be around for a long time.like I'm flying. \\"Slide In\\" is a very suggestive title for such a brilliant song.

0553801503|5.0|A Feast for Crows keeps your interest from start to finish by continuing to develop the story line as it develops the numerous characters to a depth that is very satisfying.  The chapter style of focusing your viewpoint from character to character heightens your anticipation for knowledge of each character and thus the next chapter.  Very hard book to put down.  Looking forward to the next one.  Thanks George!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|That's right-a farmer. Says it right there in the book. Pigs would be in the vicinity of his house! The pig wasn't IN his house either, and the movie was filmed on an ACTUAL house that was period-correct and accurate for man in Mr. Bennet's circumstances as a gentleman farmer. As someone mentioned earlier, did it BOTHER any of you when the '95 version showed no signs of a farm? <br /> <br />This is a great movie. The people who play Lizzie and DArcy are the right age for the story, which I thought added greatly to the overall tone of the movie. Lizzie's and Darcy's actions make much more sense when you imagine them being 20 and 28, their ages in the novel. It's suppossed to be a story about young love and misunderstanding and missteps you make with that young love, and I think both Knightly and Macfadyen portrayed that brilliantly.
B00005JNRE|5.0|Nanny McPhee is absolutely entertaining in every way.  Emma Thompson is delightful in her role.  Very entertaining movie.  I watched it twice at the movie theater.
B0000TLA9G|2.0|If you are a Guns N' Roses fan there is absolutely no reason for you to buy this disc as you most likely already have all of this material (with the possible exception of the Sympathy For the Devil cover which you can get on the Interview with the Vampire soundtrack). If you are new to this band I would likewise advise avoiding this compilation. The track selection is quite poor. I mean of the 14 tracks here, 5 are cover tracks! That's 40% of the album! The only cover that deserves to be on this album is Knockin' On Heaven's Door which is thoroughly awesome. Live and Let Die is entertaining but not great. There should be no tracks from the awful Spaghetti Incident album and Sympathy for the Devil while good does not deserve to be on a 'greatest hits' album. With those tracks elimanated what could we put on this disc in their place? How about any of the following: Nightrain, Mr. Brownstone, Estranged (why this is not on hear is mind boggling), Garden of Eden, Coma, Right Next Door to Hell, One in a Million, Locomotive or Pretty Tied Up. To make matters worse there aren't even any interesting liner notes or photo galleries. Nothing. Avoid this disc unless you find it somewhere used for 1 or 2 dollars. Otherwise just buy Appetite for Destruction, Use Your Illusion 1&2 and if still interested Lies.
B000000IRB|5.0|This is a wonderful version of a wonderful album. One of the best things about the Mobile Fidelity CDs is that they allow a far better dynamic range in the music. Most CDs are engineered for maximum volume, at the price of music quality. There is a limit to how loud any sound on a CD can be. To make it sound louder the engineer compresses the sound, making more of the middle level sounds reach this maximum, causing a muddiness that can't be EQ'd out. MFSL Ultradisks will not sound as loud or blown out as a normal CD, and some people can't hear the difference in quality this allows because they're used to listening to garbage. Loudness is not quality, neither is the artificial emphasis that some engineers put on the highs to compensate for the horrible compression that has to be used to make a CD sound louder. The tremendous improvement in imaging this version has is instantly obvious to me. If it isn't loud enough invest in a better pre-amp. Your system isn't as good as you thought it was - just loud.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Good movies and it's interesting how much the effects have advanced.  These movies now look a bit dated.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|she reminds me of an ex I once had. She seems like the girl next door instead of a hollywood star. <br /> <br /> <br />She can act and act well; not a hollywood diva; at least i dont think so..... <br /> <br /> <br />This movie touches all aspects of human nature AND ALL THE EMOTIONS OF THAT PARTICULAR SPECTRUM. <br /> <br />I recommend it
B000002J0B|5.0|Houses of the Holy is probably the bands best,if- infact you can <br />take the time to go through it all. The \\"Rain song\\" ,\\"song remains the same\\" \\"Dancin days\\"etc are the best in the bands innovations. <br />Its and album for the windows down in the car, or outside during <br />a cookout,or really anytime. The instrumentation is exceptional. <br /> <br />This album is a must for any rock collection. OH, and if you haven't guest by now it is my all time favorite since the 70's.
B00025ETIW|4.0|So, I've read a few reviews of this CD. And I don't really think that I care about defining them as a musical...whatever. Broken down, they've got great riffs, a charasmatic and powerful lead singer, and some smart and entertaining lyrics.<br /><br />What do I care if they are punk, emo, hard rock, hard core, blah blah blah. A label is only useful if you need to find something fast in the music store. Otherwise, all I care about is if this is any good. I can safely say yes. You tell me?
0446310786|4.0|Well I loved this book.   <br /> <br />I was travelling around in India at the time of reading, didn't have much choice of literature and just thought I'd read a bunch of classics.  This was one of them, and for the people who said this was difficult to read...I cannot understand where you are coming from.  This was a dream to read, I couldn't stop myself, I stayed up at night just to read this.  The characters - Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dil and Miss Maude being my favourites - are captivating and it is so easy to empathise with them.   <br /> <br />Some weird reviewer boasted having an IQ of 140 and not liking TKAM.  That is completely irrelevant - how can you imagine your review is more reliable simply because you have a logical mind?  Artistic appreciation is not measured in a number.  Just like your musicality is not measured by your ability to read music. <br /> <br />This is human drama at its best - if you're interested in people and their relationships then this will be a most rewarding read.  If you're looking for an action-packed book, I wouldn't say this is it, but there are some intriguing plotlines and twists that I enjoyed very much. <br /> <br />The reason that this book did not get five stars from me is simply because it didn't make me cry or laugh out loud that much.  It did stir considerable emotion in me, but it is not the best book I have ever read.  I loved the character of Atticus - although he may be a little bit too good to be true in the given context.  But you never know :-D <br /> <br />Having said that, I enjoyed reading this book profusely and would recommend it to anyone in search of a modern classic.

B00005JOWF|1.0|I saw UltraViolet last night. THAT MOVIE WAS BEYOND STUPID BEYOND RETARDED BEYOND DUMB. I think whoever made it was high and makes Japanese Porn. This movie had no plot, no story and it was just soooo stupid. All of us girls were laughing our heads off when the heros/main characters were dying. OMG you guys have no idea how dumb it was. I would recommend it just to have a great laugh and have fun making fun of it. We laughed sooo hard some of us were crying!. But seriously you guys I still am in shock at how stupid this movie was. My brain hurts at the thought that people would like and enjoy this movie, that people would make this movie is beyond me... but it was an experience that  I will never forget. the lines oh the lines from the movie were the greatest...  I would have left in the middle and gotten my money back but it was too funny to not finish! I am glad I spent FREAKING $9.50 ON THAT WORTHLESS PIECE OF CRAP!! ehhehehe So ummm if you have $10 to waste and want to have fun go see it! <br /> <br />
0451529308|5.0|You know the story. If you don't, many of these other reviewers have done the job for me. For me, this is my most favorite book in all of American literature. Growing up, I had a friend who was just like Beth and everytime I re-read this book, I remember my childhood adventures with Beth. The fictional Beth in \\"Little Women\\" was as much of a friend as my other friend, too. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this book enough. If you haven't read it -- you must read it.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|Now, I preface this review by saying that while I have long counted Stargate (the movie) as one of my favorite movies, I never got into SG-1, not least because it didn't run on any channel we got back in our pre-cable days. Stargate Atlantis premiered the year we finally got cable, and we were fans from the first episode, due largely to the wit of Rodney McKay. However, from the very first episode I have been driven nigh unto insane by one heretofore unexplained aspect of the show: How on earth (or Atlantis) does the team understand any of the people they come into contact with?? Come on, at least make SOME attempt to explain it! Perhaps they covered this on SG-1 and assumed all fans of Atlantis would be carrying over? I mean, is is a Universal Translater ala Star Trek? Translator drone thingies ala Farscape? Please, for the love of all things holy, explain this, because I'll tell ya, I'm buying the whole wormholes-through-space, life-sucking-bug-people, folks-evolving-into-pure-energy thing, but this Esperanto gig the galaxy has going on? That's going too far!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|This is a terrific film that captures the essence of Johnny Cash and his love for June Carter.  Although I would have liked to seen more of Johnny's music career and a little less of the \\"alcohol and drug\\" struggles, Joaquin was fabulous!  He deserved the Oscar as Best Actor.  Reese Witherspoon is a sweet, spunky actress but she didn't convince me she was June Carter, but merely \\"acting the part\\".  As one reviewer stated, she was like a school girl playing dress up. Can't say she was Oscar worthy either.  Joaquin is a fine actor with true expression and depth - I look forward to seeing him in more riveting roles.

B00003CWPL|5.0|I wait for these two movies (Eraserhead and Lynch short movies) since I saw them 20 years ago. <br />I think Lynch is one of the most important directors in the whole story of cinema because He succeeds in make his audience to travel between dream and reality, just cinema has to do. <br />the quality of two DVDs I bought is excellent. <br />I wait for other chance to dialogue with Amazon. <br />greetings, <br />adolfo fattori
0679422714|4.0|This book is well written, but it has little if any objectivity.  However, it is definitely worth reading if you are a history buff with a built in propoganda filter in your brain, porpoganda to support the Taiwan \\"Mafia.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never saw the series on TV so I was able to watch the series on DVD in the order they were intended.  I truly believe that Fox should re-evaluate their TV show offerings.  This show was thought provoking and intelligently written.  I am glad to see that there were no aliens and that humans can be just as mean/cruel/powerhungry 500 years in the future as they are today.  I thoroughly enjoyed every episode and the light banter and wisecracks helped make the crew feel like a real family.  I also appreciated the fact that not everything was explained and you had to wait sometimes to find out the answer as that helped draw the viewer into the show.   <br />     I was raised on Star Trek and Star Wars and I truly believe that this is what Star Trek should have been.  The only way humanity is going to reach the peaceful level of life shown in Star Trek is by a major change in humanity.  Therefore Star Trek showed us what we could be but was too antiseptic for my tastes. <br />     Star Wars is a reasonably good series, but with the large number of oxygen breathing/English speaking aliens it still lacks a level of reality that I can relate to.  Don't even ask about episodes I, II and III as they should never have been made in my opinion.   <br />     I truly believe that Fox canceled the show because it didn't necessarily show humanity in a good light, and by showing us as we truly are Fox didn't want to anger some political activist/Religious group somewhere.   <br />     In conclusion I have watched every episode at least 3 times and always find something new in them.  I have not watched network or cable TV in about 5 years and after seeing the tv shows that get canceled as well as the ones that stay around, I can safely say I made the right decision.  Therefore Fox can keep all the lame \\"Reality\\" show ideas they have, and I will keep my Firefly box set.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|PRIDE & PREJUDICE is a handsomely mounted production, moodily filmed with a pervasive dark texture of visual expression about it. It is quite a visual presentation of the story where dialogue is left unspoken and the power of the images both animate and inanimate speak for themselves. That is not to say that the film goes on without dialogue, but rather quite the opposite. The many exchanges of dialogue are witty, brilliantly structured, eloquently spoken and presented with an economy of style that is concisely intelligent. This film with its intricately mounted visuals and words does an admirable job of bringing this literary work to the screen with all the constraints inherent in the medium of the cinema. Director Joe Wright also did a more than commendable job of representing the two main characters. Keira Knightley gives an awe-inspiring performance as Lizzie giving her great insight of the human condition. Lizzie though impetuous at times has a gift of rationalizing human behavior with a certain sense of reality offsetting loftier romantic ideals thus making her a young woman of keen intelligence. I truly enjoyed Matthew MacFadyen's performance as Darcy. He seems a young man tired and perplexed by convention but knows no other way to conduct himself and is trapped by his by his social status but more importantly by his own upbringing. Matthew MacFadyen's does an exceptional job conveying this. Awkwardly trying to emote his inner feelings he does more to alienate Lizzie than win her affections. MacFadyen's Darcy is truly a man misunderstood. Only through good and anonymous deeds can the true nature of the man prevail. I think this is a very good film rich with artistic fervor yet embracing all that is good of the human spirit. The DVD extras are very good.
B00005JOWF|5.0|I am not much of a action fan ! But I have to say this was an extemley entertaining film ! The visuals were amazing this was one of the most ultramodern movies I had ever seen. Most movies that take place in the future looks like today's world. U are able to tell something is out of sync, somehow. But Kurt Wimmer had a vision, a true vison. Non of the buildings were recognizable all of the vehicles were prototypes. U had a bracelets for credit cards? Dispensible telephones that pop out of a machines? The set and architecture were all original. Even though they were CGI's at least there was time and thought put into it. The sets were very colorful and the costumes were cool. This was extremley well made as far as creativity was concerned.  <br /> <br /> The fight sequences were bad ass ! Yes, there were a couple of fights that were too short. And the odds were just unbelievable ! But for the most part these were some of the best fight sequences I have seen since Kill bill ! Especially when she took out all those guards in that library and that orchestrated music was playing. At the end of the fight she held her gun up in the air, Kneeled down with sprinkles falling ! That was bad ass ! I almost wanted to get up and clap after that. I was high off of adrenaline the whole time I was in the theater. I hadn't felt like that since kill bill ! Milla was stunning throughout and very tough through the film. Her confidence and straight forwardness, made u really believe in what she was doing. Everyone's arguement was that she was no stronger than anyone she was fighting. Well ! have u ever been pissed off ? When someone is pissed they can do the impossible. And she was a very pissed and a angry young lady. Which the explained at the beginning of the movie Why? So in a since I can see that it is quite possible for her to take out some of the people she did. The movie opens up with 40 mins of none stop action ! This is before u get to any type of plot which  I felt was a new and interesting way to open ! I love the matrix as much as anyone else did ! But in all honesty after the first, reloaded offered very little more. At times the Matrix got to preachy and put me to sleep ! Equilibrum showed Kurt Wimmer's potiental as an amazing fight coordinator ! But was illustrated very little because of Equilibrium's long drawn out plot ! In this film he just showed out and gave us nothing but action. It seemed like he was trying too hard but it was effective ! I have never seen ANYTHING like this ! I can honestley say with a straight face! I am not a action move lover because they bore me ! But this was a visually stunning film, I don't care what anyone says ! This was much more appealing to me than Resident Evil: Apocalyse ! That  had wooden acting and not so great effects compared to this ! But Ultraviolet delivers something abit more ! If your looking for \\"Brokeback mountain\\" this movie isn't for you. This is a artistic piece for people that like visuals! <br /> <br /> The movie critics are horrible ! Noone can appreaciate a fun unusual unique movie anymore. Its a shame when movies like Underworld: Evolutions, Bloodrayne (Better than most), Equilibrium, May, High Tension, Mulholland Dr and Donnie Darko. Can't get any awards, recongnition or decent ratings ! But Sh*t like Brokeback Mountian and Memoirs of Geisa this is the Sh*t that people think it Great ? What is the world coming too ? And King Kong ? Something that has been made twice already ? Please David Lynch, Len Wisemen, Lucky Mckee and Kurt Wimmer don't give up in film making ! There are still people out there who can appreciate real art and not \\"Tear jerkers !\\" And how is it that \\"Million dollar baby\\" got voted out over Kill bill,last year at the Emmy's or Oscars ? Who knows ! See that is what I am talking about ! Even Hustle and Flow ? That was crap but that is what the world has come too ! Oh well ! I am interested in seeing how Basic Instinct 2 does ? <br /> <br /> <br />Arish
0783225725|5.0|The outstanding outdoor scenery of this somewhat esoteric Western makes its plot more unnerving and beguiling than the ordinary Western. Besides the scenery there is Clint Eastwood as a mysterious, enigmatic and very ominous stranger who comes to lend his expertise to the common townsfolk against returning outlaws. The results are of the fantastic and the true nature of Eastwood's motivations are slowly unveiled. Yet the true nature of Eastwood's character remains a point of speculation. This is a riveting film. As the classic Western cinematic genre neared its end this film echoed and resonated the grief and pain felt at the death of this genre.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Terrific show.  Very sad that it wasn't renewed.  Hope it comes back.
B000005B0U|5.0|Man this soundtrack rocks!  It's got everybody who's anybody in Blues on it.
0156027321|4.0|I thought this book was very good at portraying what it would be like to be stuck out in the middle of the ocean for what seems like eternity.  However, there were some parts of the book that would have been better if I could have had a discussion with someone about it before continuing on (would be an awesome book to read for a college course).  I will not say which parts, but you will figure it out when you read the book.  The author did a great job with the ending, but I hate not really knowing (again, you'll see when you read the book).  Very clever!
0307276902|1.0|It would have been so much better if he actually told the truth if he was going to present it as truth!  The reader can not help but feel frauded.  I know people like the persona he made or stole for the character, and there is nothing amazing or special about being a complete waste of flesh.  His character is so self absorbed he can't see how inconsequential a crack head is.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|This movie was made with a kind of passion that is very rare in Hollywood these days. Great fun.
B0006399FS|5.0|I LOVED this album.  It is nice to have an album you can listen to with your 12 year old in the car without having to skip over songs.  It was a very positive and uplifting album.  My favorite song was \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" followed by \\"A Man and a Woman\\".
B000286RZM|5.0|well if you have an open mind you can really see the beauty this album has in it John is a genuis thanks to him the peppers are still around and rockin and is too me the Best guitarist going right now!
B000E6UK5K|2.0|During the lead up to the Live 8 concerts last year, the big new was the reuniting of Pink Floyd, well san a still missing in action Syd. Many faithful hoped that this may be the beginning of thing to come with maybe a tour or even a new concert. Even during the concert, the band mates seemed cordial, getting together with a bow at the end. Since then both David Gilmour and Roger Waters stated that Live 8 was a one time thing with Waters promptly releasing an opera and Gilmour a just released album. <br /> <br />On an Island is Gilmour's third solo record, which comes long longer than once in a blue moon, his last was eighteen years ago. Like many Pink Floyd albums, this one starts off with an instrumental, but Castellorizon is clunky and in no way sets a good mood for the album. This then transitions into the title track that sound very much like a part from Shine on You Crazy Diamond but without the passion or heartfelt lyrics. Speaking about songs that rip off another with less passion, the same could be said for Take a Breath but with Led Zeppelin's Kashmir. <br /> <br />The only interesting aspect of the album is that it fulfills the fantasy of wondering what a band named Crosby, Gilmour, and Nash would sound like with Dave harmonizing with the other David and Graham on the title track. Almost makes you wonder what Pink Floyd would have sounded like if the recruited Stephan Stills instead. <br /> <br />The main problem with this album is, whereas Pink Floyd songs you just lay back and soak in the lengthy arrangements, many of the songs for On an Island leave you looking at your watch wondering if this is still the same song. But in the end if you already have all the Pink Floyd albums, this would make a good companion, if not, you'd be better off plugging your holes in your album collection. And if you don't own Pink Floyd albums, I suggest you start off with Wish You Were Here and Dark Side of the Moon in that order.
0553573403|5.0|This bold, brutal, emotional and, most importantly, humane fantasy epic transmits the same enderaring sense of awe of the movie \\"Excalibur\\", though with a multitude of deep characters and an extremely complex nest of intertwined plotlines rarely seen even in books. A life-transforming experience!
B0002Y4T92|5.0|This is a really good representation of the shows. They don't tell you that the Robert Cray cut was the first song of his set and was the best modern blues song of the day. Eric Johnson doing \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" is one of the biggest missing moments. There were so many moments I'm sure it was daunting to pick them, but when John Mayer wailed his solo with Eric,BB,& Buddy watching then laid his guitar at the feet of Buddy Guy bowed to him and walked off the stage, there was more electricity in the  air than the lightning that forced an early end to the show. Wish that one made it. <br /> <br />The reality though is after you stand them all side by side for two days, Eric was still the best we heard all weekend.  To bad the encore of Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and ZZ Top doing \\"I'm Going Down\\" never happened.  We heard them rehearsing it Saturday night outside the bowl on the way home from the promenade concerts, and it was over the top.
B000AP04OM|5.0|What can I say? What can anyone say about 'The Sound of Music'? It's got everything: love, evil, laughter, children, the Alps, nuns, and of course the delightful Julie Andrews. Now, finally, here is the definitive version of the old screen classic that has become a cult favorite. The old cast is brought back together for a reunion, the kids are all grown up now and dissipated into different life styles, Julie and Chris still look great together...really, this 2-Disc DVD set has it all.  <br /> <br />I don't think anyone needs reminding of the story, so I won't dwell on that too much. My parents' generation grew up on these songs, as did I. The glorious music of Rodgers and Hammerstein have kept this epic landmark of a film in the hearts of three generations, and no doubt still more to come. Just go up to anyone and whistle 'Do Re Mi' and I promise you they'll recognize it. This film has become so ingrained within our culture that young kids don't even realize that the old tunes they've heard over and over are actually from 'The Sound of Music'. <br /> <br />Everytime I have enough time to sit down and watch this film again, I am filled with a sense of escape. I can leave this chaotic world and enter Maria's realm of innocence and first love. This film stands for old values that are hardly seen anymore in today's modern world, and certainly it does not do well to dwell on past times. But escaping from time to time is fun.  <br /> <br />The extras on this DVD are really something. I particularly enjoyed the fireside chat between Julie and Chris Plummer where they reminisced about old times. The featurettes scattered throughout are also very informative and give an in-depth look into the creation of one of America's best-loved films. The reunion of the von Trapp children, now in their 40s and 50s (or 60s in the case of Liesl), presents a nostalgic look into an excursion in their past. I'm rather amazed the littlest one still remembers that much; I certainly wouldn't ifI were five. Commentaries by Julie Andrews are also delightful to hear, she really is a dame and one of the most elegant people alive.  <br /> <br />So gather your family and friends around you, pop in this DVD, turn on the surround sound, and let the music wash over you! Some people call it corny, but I say 'So what? Just let go and have fun!'
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Simply a fantastic movie.  Reese and Joaquin absolutely own the screen in this exceptional movie.  Stunning in itself, but made even more so by the fact that the two leads did their own singing.  This lent to the authenticity of the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0977326403|5.0|Churches need to focus on faithfulness and on fruitfulness. This book reminds those in the church that if you do not plan to be more fruitful and grow, you will most likely not grow. This book challenges churches to establish goals and define means to reach toward those benchmarks. If the average mainline church is in decline, does your church want to be average? This book is inspired by the Holy Spirit to push churches toward being great at sharing the grace of Christ, not modeled after business groups but like other great organizations.
0767819594|2.0|I'll start off by saying that this movie had a lot of promise in the beginning. The dialogue (especially a lot of Sebastion's lines) was really witty and smart.   But somewhere near the climax, the movie turned into another sappy teen romance movie. That really disappointed me. I was hoping for something a little more than that. And (SPOILER) what also really disappointed me about this movie was when Annette lost her virginity. Her character changed so fast that it was unbelievable! It would have been more interesting if she had stayed a virgin.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I'm not one for movies of this nature.  I was not a fan of Ang Lee's 'Sense and Sensibility' yet after watching this wonderful and delightful film I just might watch the latter again, you know, for a second opinion.  Based off of Jane Austins novel of the same name, Pride & Prejudice revolves around Elizabeth Bennet (Knightley) and her sisters as their mother (Brenda Blethyn) tries to marry them off.  The eldest daughter Jane (Rosamund Pike) is quickly taken fancy by a wealthy young man, yet it's his best friend Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) who catches the eye of young Liz, but not in a good way.  While she can't deny her attraction for him, his arogance blinds her love and drives her away from him, but as events take place that uncover her eyes to the real man he is she puts her pride and pejudice aside to be with the man she loves.  The acting here is top notch, with Keira taking the top position here.  She was brilliant, lovable, likable, adorable and believable.  Donald Sutherland, who play's Liz's father, did amazing with his role and I can see why so many wanted him to recieve an oscar nomination.  I was also very impressed with the amount of power Dame Judi Dench brought to a role that recieved such little screen time.  The scene where she confronts Liz is one of the best in the film.  She truly is a star.  This film, from start to finish, was oscar worthy and theres no doubt in my mind that we'll see Keira at the awards again soon, hopfully this time she will be taking home her own little (yet heavy) man.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Why does Madonna refuse to acknowledge that she is a middle-aged mother who looks ridiculous trying to look and act like she is 20 years old. I've never been much of a Madonna fan, and the few tracks I've heard on this album only reinforce my opinion of her music. I admit that at one time she was an innovative force in the music/entertainment industry, even with VERY limited vocal talent, but c'mon now.. isn't time to pack it up already? It goes to show that it doesn't take much to be $ucce$$ful in today's mainstream market.
0688163173|5.0|I read this book before Mystic River and I have to say that I was hooked upon the first paragraph.  The charactor development was so spot on that you are drawn in to each and every person.  The story revolves around US Marshall Teddy Daniels as he is summoned to help find a missing inmate by the name of Rachel Solando at Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane.  It's shocking how she was able to escape past locked cells and armed guards, and the fact that no one saw it happen is even more shocking.  But she is gone, no denying that.  The story is engrossing as a storm sets in and forces Teddy to remain on the island where he uncovers what may be an illegal operation taking place on the island.  As you delve deeper into Teddy's charactor, unveiling his past, you realive areas that may or may not have something to do with his current predicament...but as the clues are uncovered I promise you, it's not that easy.  The ending is so insane (no pun intended) that you'll be kicking yourself for not having guessed it before.  I will let you in on a little secret.  I guessed the ending, but only because my cousin read the novel first and hinted towards it.  Lehane is one hell of an awsome writter...I can't wait to read Mystic River now.  Brilliant!
0141301074|4.0|The book is not exactly what I expected, but it is a genuine R. Dahl.  I thought it would be literature for children, but it is far from that. Even so, although I do not recommend this book for people under 15/16, I strongly recommend it to all other readers.  Interesting, magic in some way, teaching lessons, sardonic, etc.  Chocolate factory is in it too.
B00008972S|5.0|Not only is this timeless adapatation of the broadway play spectacular the indepth interviews are interesting and revealing.
B000003CMC|5.0|If you're keeping score, this would be the third time I've rewritten my review of Eat a Peach. By the looks of it, this is the final. It's been a few months since the last time I went through and reviewed it, and a few months and several listens later I'm beginning to see the light. This, ladies and gentlemen, is not only the Allmans' best album, but arguably the greatest double-album of all time. There's nothing that even comes close to filler. I know I bashed Les Brers in A Minor and Mountain Jam on my previous reviews, but those two have grown on me, as has Blue Sky. All right, you're bored now. On with the show!<br /><br />Right from when the opening notes of Ain't Wastin' Time No More hit, you know you're in for something good. And sure enough, you are. Gregg shines on keyboards (love that little piano blurb at the start!) and vocals, plus Dickey's (not Duane's, he was sadly dead by this point) slide guitar beefs up the tune. Les Brers in A Minor is Betts' obligatory family-sized instrumental. No, it's nowhere near In Memory of Elizabeth Reed (my favorite rock instrumental ever, for what it's worth). Whatever, it's still a good tune, rising from a lengthy, cinematic introduction to a git-down-'n'-boogie second half that's a blast to listen to. As usual, Gregg's organ is a high point. Big-time radio hit Melissa (though it might as well have been called Duane, since that's who it's really about) is by far the group's best ballad - wrenching vocals are a big highlight, and Gregg proves he can write lyrics that are more than good-timey if he tries at it (he repeats the performance with Ain't Wastin' Time).<br /><br />OK, onto Mountain Jam. This one takes a while to grow on you, for the simple reason that it's longer than a half-hour. But once it does, you'll never look back. For one it's got a great melody. But when that melody ends, the \\"jam\\" part opens up (the melody being \\"mountain\\" - based off of Donovan's \\"First There Is a Mountain\\"). The group goes insane for about twenty minutes, with virtuoso performances all around. And though it's long, it's also truly captivating. Let's face it, these guys were great instrumentalists - all six of 'em, and not just Duane (though he was the best). Speaking of Duane, yes he does appear on this cut, and yes he does play slide guitar. Need I say more? This was recorded live, as were the other two tunes. First is their cover of One Way Out, my favorite Allmans tune ever. Why? For one, if you weren't sold on Gregg's blues vocals, I can't help you. And if you were, the bar-tradin' guitar solo in the middle should only pull you in further. If it doesn't, you can't consider yourself an Allmans fan. Harsh, but true. They also cut a typically good cover of Trouble No More, though both the studio version and Muddy's original are better, I'm a fan of this one!<br /><br />Now, onto Studio Side #2, AKA The Studio Side With Duane On It. First off is the funky Stand Back, love that little bass solo stuck in the middle! Then there's the huge radio hit Blue Sky, which is one hell of a song. It's true. The postive, feel-good vibes which draw you in are only part of it. Listen to the guitar jam in the middle, man! Vintage Allmans. Probably the best-known song of the bunch. And really, who's gonna wonder why? The album-closer Little Martha is also a highlight, simple but beautifully, lyrically effective. Little tune really tugs at the ol' heartstrings, especially when you consider it was the last bit of music Duane Allman ever put out in his life. Outside of its legacy, though, it's simply an amazingly melodic tune. I can't praise it enough.<br /><br />If you're a rock fan and don't have a copy of Eat a Peach, I don't know what you're thinking. It's simply that good.<br /><br />Now, a little shout-out to Duane: we all miss you. If there's a heaven up there, it's about time someone called him down, kept him far away from the drugs, and maybe, just maybe, have him send every guitarist in existence back home, crying in jealousy. Him and Hendrix. Those two should come back (I never knew any of them personally, but I've heard that they were great people in addition to their guitar heroics). BUY THE FRIGGIN' THING!im and Hendrix. Those two should come back (I never knew any of them personally, but I've heard that they were great people in addition to their guitar heroics). BUY THE FRIGGIN' THING!
0316234753|5.0|I bought this one years ago for my older son when he was 3. Now it is my younger son (4 years now)'s favorite book. He can just sit by the table and draw with this book for hours. The book is a very good teaching guide. It teaches you to draw animals with simple instructions--so simple that a 4 years old can draw a owl just by following this book. I am going to buy another one for my friend since she was amazed how well my sons can draw. Amazon should stock more these kind of books which are great and cheap so customers do not even bother to search for bargins else where.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|By my 4 star review you would think that answer would be yes, right? Well, if we're talking Johnny Cash, the answer is actually NO. Being a \\"good movie\\" and a \\"good representation\\" are not one in the same. <br /> <br />My reflections after the credits rolled were, that the movie was good, the performances were good, the movie moved, but didn't move ME. So much of the songwriting and band relationships were cast aside, and while I do appreciate the role June Carter had in JC's life, the movie made it appear as though he did nothing but stalk her. I can also appreciate the fact that the script could only be \\"so long\\" but how many 3 hour gladiator/super hero/against all odds movies have we all sat through that were TOO LONG? I say this movie could have been another hour (at least)and it wouldn't have seemed like it. In fact, Johnny Cash deserved as much. <br /> <br />In many ways the movie seemed like a cut-and-paste story of any \\"rock star\\" and sadly, I expected more. \\"Walk the Line\\" is a fine example of heartfelt movie making, but considering the subject matter, should have been a lot more painful.
0060958324|5.0|I'm not suprised to see several one star reviews here on Amazon claiming this book is the most boring piece of literature ever. It's not, and whenever I hear a bad review of this book I think how they would react if they cracked Herodotus' \\"Histories\\".<br /><br />This novel isn't for everyone. Most people that pick it up out of curiosity are likely to put it down. Mr. Pirsig states in the foreward that its not a spiritual guide or very helpful with motorcycle maintenance. In fact, Pirsig was denied several hundred times from various publishing companies when he tried to print his masterpiece. The title is misleading, but that's not what I'd like to talk about.<br /><br />The story tells us of Pirsig, and his son Chris, and of their \\"Chautauqua\\" across the western states. Shortly after the beginning Pirsig introduces his philosophical \\"other\\" self, Phaedrus (named from one of Plato's dialogues'). Phaedrus is more conflicted and anxious than the Pirsig narrating the story. He's almost obsessed with his work; people, and what Quality really means.<br /><br />As the first reviewer visible says, there are thousands of years of Philosophical thought in these few hundred pages. Most of it is Western thought (once again, \\"Zen\\" seems to mislead as a title) concerning what was probably the thoughts of the more liberal nobles in several Greek polises and Roman cities.<br /><br />\\"What is Quality?\\" This question Phaedrus asks himself after having his thought provoked by a lonely secretary in the school where he teaches. That one phrase delves into a thought process that lasts most of the book's remaining pages, drawing parallel's between Pirsig & Chris and their journey across the West.<br /><br />Watching the two story-arc's develop was quite a treat, and there were several pages on the system of Education that had me fascinated and mentally hungry for more. Pirsig seems to have put his entire heart into this novel, and that's one of its small problems: it is a novel. Why teach philosophy as a semi-autobiographical novel? He may have wanted more people to learn of Socrates and other great teachers (which certainly happened by looking at the strong underground fanbase this book has), or may have started the novel without it, and masked some of the books more subtle insecurities with Platonics.<br /><br />It's not clear as to why it's presented the way it is. However, by the ending of the book you'll be astonished at how much you may have learned about yourself (as cliche as this sounds, it does leave you thinking - not many novels do it with this depth).  And I strongly urge you to read this book in private and be wary of reviews you read. Many boast about this novel's shocking ending, and I urge you to find out why yourself.<br /><br />Overall, ZAMM is a novel and more. It's the human heart, with all its inconsistencies and heartaches, laid down with hundreds of years of Western thought and psychology in a single novel. The characters feel real (I still think about Phaedrus often, years after reading it), and not one word is wasted in telling the story of these wonderful, flawed human beings. Those that give it bad reviews probably don't have the patience to sit down and enjoy a novel that requires thought and attention.<br /><br />They're probably the same people who think all bikers are the same.

B00005ASHM|3.0|What is the big deal? Wouldn't it be nice and Caroline no are great songs. There's 3 more good songs and a nice instrumental and the rest is filler. Sure, its great for a Beach Boys album but in the great universe of music this is just a really good pop album.<br /><br />I suppose if I'd never heard jazz or classical music I too would think that Brian's use of vibraphone and glockenspiel was some sign of genius. And if I'd never heard the Platters, the Lettermen or Manhattan Transfer I too would think that the Beach Boys were a great vocal band. Brian brought a good sense of vocal and instrumental arrangement together with some good material to create a pop record that had more depth than most at the time of its release. Just keeping it real.
078401213X|5.0|The main character is a paranoid, out of order, lock in, mathamatician that never stops calculating. But hold on, there's more to the story. This guy is also an envelope pusher. When the movie starts, we realize that his character is not all together there. He has frequent headaches and nightmares. Could be due to his condition: when he was a little boy he stared up into the sun for a dangerous amount of time. the doctors say that his pupils dialated to the size of pin holes. But that's not what the story is about. The story is really about a set of numbers. No one really knows what it is.<br /><br />One says it's random computer junk.<br /><br />Another thinks it's part of a code.<br /><br />One thinks it could help figure out the stock market.<br /><br />A group of people think that it is a code for the actual name of God.<br /><br />The real insanity comes from just knowing that the code exsists. That's what the character goes through. If it is not a numerial code for good . . .could it be a numerial code for evil?<br /><br />Full of intrigue, suspense, and an interest in math.<br /><br />the movie is in full black and white.<br /><br />Really wierd camera angles as well as some messed up scenes. Soundtrack is also weird, like from the twighlight zone. Rent it, if anything else.<br /><br />Enjoy!

6304936303|5.0|Bruce willis plays a burn out detective whose latest case lands him in very hot water. His wife just cheated on him, his new buddy is a semi-junkie pro football player, and his daughter just won't stop cussing. What a great family movie, right?<br /><br />This is a classic comedy/action movie that doesn't stop with the jokes or the thrills. Whoever wrote this script was a great comedian.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I love the move! the dvd interface was creative and tied in really well with the movie (that's the designer in me). And the concept of the movie was very well done. It reminded me of law and order mixed a little with The Exercism. I thought was great movie!
0307276902|5.0|Sure, you got \\"dupped\\".  Did you enjoy the story though?  I know I did.  Reading this book after the whole scandal, I went in not really thinking if it would be real or not.  I just read it, and finished in less than 3 days.  To me, fact or fiction, it still affected me in many different ways.  In fiction books, you feel for the main character with the problems that they go through.  Same with nonfiction books.  I have to say that is was WELL WORTH the money I paid, and I'm glad that I read it.  It is a AMAZING book and I fully back anyone who reads it.
B000BNX3B4|5.0|I love this movie, both for the acting and the story line.  I'm a single adult entering the dating world and so much of it is true!  Diane Lane and John Cusak do a wonderful job and have great chemistry.  This is definitly a chick flick, but I have found some guys who like it too!
B000002572|5.0|What can I say? This album is drugs-it simply makes you feel good when you rock it. However, I can't shake the feeling that this was the kinda stuff that would get you beat up by the Sabbath, Zeppelin and Who fans (hey, I love them too!!! Stop punching me!!!)...whatever. I'm still attempting to build my time machine, cuz I'd prefer to live in an age where an album like this charts for 2 years, rather than the Killers or whatever rap plague has hit us from the South this week...give me those sweet dual geee-tahhhhhhsss!!!!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Matthew Macfadyen alone is reason enough to buy this movie, I watched it over and over.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|I found the movie predictable and dry and felt that it was entirely misrepresented (Fiennes on the DVD pointing a gun). Mild mannered is an understatement for Fiennes, whom as an experienced diplomat appears quite naive to everything around him and only finds out the story from \\"friends\\" self motivated confessions. The only thing Fiennes does is run aroud and slightly raise his voice. It was also by far one of the weakest love stories I have ever seen. Tessa Quayle (Rachel Weisz), Fiennes wife is so engrossed in her \\"cause\\" that she has to go out of her way throughout the movie to remind the audience that she actually has a relationship. Her character fails to convince me that she even cares about her husband or their expected child; more likely that she used him to get a foot into Africa so that she could join some generic cause that makes her feel important; she is like one of those idiots from college who just wants to hug African children and mouth off to corporate figures without any training or experience with the \\"really real world\\". Every scene between Fiennes and Weisz is excruciating to watch; like a loveless marriage that neither wants to make an effort to end. The whole plot can be pieced together after 20 min into the movie. I like Fiennes as an actor and I can only look to Meirelles for making an unconvincing love story that lasts about 45 minutes too long. The end of the movie brought relief that it was over and I felt as if I've wasted 129 minutes. The movie was anticlimactic and the characters seemed to risk their lives for no reason as evident in the last scene. You are left at the end of the movie with a feeling that if these to characters never existed it would make no difference. If you are looking for action or a moving love story look elsewhere, Fiennes and Weisz had no chemistry. I had all I could do not to turn the movie off.
B000BRBA8S|4.0|This was the first Wong Kar Wai film I ever saw.  I have since gone back and viewed some of his other movies, and I have enjoyed them all.  Yet, I think this one is still my favorite.  It's one of those films that sort of 'creeps' up on you.  Before you know it, the film is done, but the story stays with you... and then you end up wanting to watch it again.  This film will be especially of interest to those who have a slightly more eccentric taste in films.  Don't get me wrong, it's not overtly bizzare, it's just different than your 'run-of-the-mill' storyline.  Some will complain that the plot is difficult to follow, or even incoherent.  It helps, however, if you've seen \\"In the Mood for Love,\\" and I also took the time to watch some of the special features where Wong Kar Wai discusses the process of making the film and his desired intention in creating it.  I found both the special features and the follow-up viewing of \\"In the Mood for Love\\" interesting and helpful.  Overall though, I simply enjoyed the tone and mood of the film.  I feel that many 'Western' films often sacrifice the art of subtlety  in order to focus on heavily plot driven stories.  I, personally, find 'subtle' movies more interesting, more thought provoking, and, usually, they are the types of films that encourage multiple viewings.  Accordingly, this is the type of film I would recommend buying.
B000005RFQ|5.0|Born again is one of the best albums put out by the great Black sabbath and the lone one with Ian Gillan who was formerly with Deep Purple.This album is fantastic from the first to the last track with excellent guitar work from Iommi.I cant stop stressing how good this album is,so buy it today.Highly  recommended.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Guns N' Roses' new album entitled \\"Greatest Hits\\" will definately become a huge victory in its record sales. I mean, who wouldn't want to buy an album with legendary hits by a band whose marked world history with their major music influence. From their first album \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" to the release of the \\"Greatest Hits\\" album, Guns N' Roses will forever be remembered for existing as such a massive icon to their audience as well as inspiring musicians. The album includes in your face hard rock songs such as \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" to the very popular \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\". Axl's softer side and beautiful voice is apparent in \\"Don't Cry\\"; and who could forget the song and movie-video of \\"November Rain\\"? The song's explicit intensity is what makes the song great. The lyrics, the choir, the guitars all work together beautifully to produce the best metal ballot of all time. This album is a definite prize collectable!
B0007N1AI6|5.0|To discover the great harmony in AOR, one should listen to it tens of times. Then the album slowly shows its hidden power, coming from the deep. One should be patient enough to reach this power of this new album. Then be sure, you will get the prize...
B000B8QG4A|4.0|As a lover of Disney films I thought I had seen all the classics, but for some reason \\"The Lady and the Tramp\\" had passed me by.  But now that I have just seen it, it truly deserves to be a \\"Disney Classic\\".<br /><br />There are alot of things about this movie that make it a joy to watch for children and adults alike.  First, this is one of the first movies where Disney used someone of noteriety (Peggy Lee).<br /><br />The plot line in this movie is sweet and very smart.  I think that the story does a great job at capturing the point of view of how the animals look at the the people in their lives.  The siamese cats were eerily evil, and sing the most memorable song in the whole movie.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the side characters especially the dogs.  (the scottish terrier and the blood hound)<br /><br />Disney for whatever reason does not release the movie very often so pick this one up now, because it won't be around for long.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I find \\"On an Island\\" to be well-produced and a pleasant listen. Well worth the cost of adding to your collection. Check it out for yourself!
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I have to admit that I was suprised when I first heard the album because my expectations led me to expected a certain sound.  This CD does NOT sound like post-Animals Floyd or even like About Face.  If that's what you expect, you'll be disappointed.  However, if you let go of those expectations and just listen to the music, I think you'll fall in love with it.  I did.  This is by far the most intimate and personal album done by anyone associated with the Floyd and the music is truly beautiful.  The album is warm, mellow, and serene.  It has amazing orchestration.  David's voice sounds incredible, and the guitar work, although less bombastic than usual, is still brilliant.   <br /> <br />In summary, I think that this is a great CD, but one has to be open to entirely new sound coming from one of Floyd's leaders.
B0000E64TR|5.0|In October, 1973 \\"Goodby Yellow Brick Road\\" was released as two LPs and re-released in 2003 as a two CD set under the cover of \\"30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition\\" in a hybrid SACD format. Wonderful way to treat this classic guys!! I'm not going into great detail because there are other good write-ups here that suffice but I will say that this set belongs in any collectors library. Highlights include: 'Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding', 'Candle In The Wind', 'Bennie and The Jets' (my favorite), 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road', 'All The Young Girls Love Alice', 'Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting' and a bonus 'Screw You (Young Man Blues)'.
0895260131|5.0|This is a very important book. Spencer provides facts in a very concise, well organized and documented fashion. <br /> <br />Many of the detractors among reviews here attempt to paint a moral equivalence between bad things that have been done in the name of Christianity and bad things that have been done in the name of Islam. They fail to recognize that, contrary to Christianity, authentic Islam embraces violent expansionism and oppression and these negatives are woven throughout. Spencer uses this contrast specifically to conduct analysis of foundational Islamic belief as it relates to incitement of violence upon non-Muslims. <br /> <br />Spencer's book is an evaluation of a belief system and not a judgment on believers as individual persons. It is very important to remember this throughout all discussions of this sort. <br /> <br />Ideas and beliefs have consequences both for those who hold those beliefs and, perhaps more importantly, consequences for communities, societies, and civilization at large. This should provide further motivation to contemplate Spencer's work with a clear, thinking mind that is not impeded by bigotry and hatred toward any religion.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|This is a great Christmas DVD and is a feel good joy ride. Marvelous special effects. Tom Hanks is his usual great self doing many of the voices of the characters. Another Robert Zemeckis gem to be watched every holiday season or anytime you want. 4.5 stars.
B0002EXH5O|1.0|Dave re did the voclas and i even think some of the instruments were over dubbed! Do not miss this classic speed/thrash metal masterpiece. Every song is a classic but is found ruined by daves horrible vocal uver bubs and so on. THIS IS NOT RUST IN PEACE AS US METAL HEADS ALL KNOW AND LOVE!!!!!!! STAY AWAY FAAAAAARRRR AWAY FROM THIS!
B0009SS00A|3.0|Like many reviewers of this book have already mentioned, \\"Digital Fortress\\" is not \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", well....no duh!  It this reviewer's estimation, it's not even close, so don't expect the same kind of page-turning excitement that readers of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" have experienced.<br /><br />As a pot-boiler thriller it is only lukewarm.  Rather than go through the plot synopsis and waste your time, let me go over just the highs and lows of the book and let you pick up the synopsis through another review.<br /><br />HIGH - Good characterization<br /><br />LOW - Fairly unbelieveable premise for the plot<br /><br />HIGH - The plot moves right along and this is a quick weekend \\"read\\".<br /><br />LOW - There is so much fluff in this book that the reader will feel like skipping parts.<br /><br />HIGH - Plenty of suspense on two continents<br /><br />LOW - Much of the David Becker \\"search-for-the-ring-in-Spain\\" portion could have been cut in half without losing any plot details.<br /><br />HIGH - A variety of characters, some you will want to know more about.<br /><br />LOW - Predictable<br /><br />HIGH - Makes you think, especially about our government's access to what we think is our own private information.<br /><br />LOW - Implausible ending, with a \\"in-the-nick-of-time, James Bond -type finish.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION:  If you're a Dan Brown fan then you will definitely want to read \\"Digital Fortress\\".  If you're just looking for a Dan Brown book to read, then grab a copy of \\"Angles and Demons\\" followed by \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  You won't be disappointed.
B000001Y2U|3.0|Alice Cooper, Kiss, and Skinny Puppy.  Manson stole a lot from those bands especially in this record.  Even the live show for Anti-Christ Superstar had a lot in common with some of the stuff done on Skinny Puppy's Last Rights tour.  At least he knows who to steal from and it's still entertaining regardless.
0670033375|5.0|While I haven't finished the book yet, I've read enough to find Jared Diamond's analysis compelling and instructional.  Particularly with an increasing rate of change and worldwide repercussions to decisions that used to only be felt locally.  I hope we choose wisely so that our society will be one of the prevailing ones.  This book is a must read for our government and business professionals.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Let's just look at this film, not Joaquin Phoenix's last film or Reese Witherspoon's last film. Let's just look at the script as it was written, not as someone else might have written it. Let's just consider the singing of Phoenix and Witherspoon and not make minute comparisons to Cash and Carter. In other words, when you consider this film on its own merits, as a biop and entertainment, you've got to love it. One gets a good sense of Cash's struggles with his father's rejection, his brother's early death, his frustrations with his first wife, June Carter's continuous rejection of Cash's marriage proposals, and Cash's addictions to pills and alcohol. One also is immensely entertained by the driving sound track, the great musical numbers, the early touring with Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis, and the fiesty and energetic performance of Witherspoon as a charismatic June Carter. Phoenix and Witherspoon are terrific together. Their chemistry is palpable and infectious. And although, like all commercial films, some of the facts no doubt have been bent to add drama to the story, I loved the whole thing. I just wonder why such a supposedly tough guy like Cash didn't go after his rejecting and downright ugly father. I also wonder where all his talent came from and how he got that voice and style. But one thing's for sure, he was a unique artist and his story, as portrayed in this movie, is well worth seeing, hearing, and loving
B000B8QEZG|2.0|this is the first madonna album that i've gotten. i took a chance without even listening to it that madonna had went back to the 80's slightly hip-hoped pop madonna. but its far worse. madonna has gone into the territory of...*gasp*--TECHNO!! if u like techno, thats fine, get this album, but to anyone who thiks this album is gonna be...hmm....good-do not get this album. unless u have the word DJ in front of your have or own a club, save this money for a night at Ruby Tuesday's.
0553296981|4.0|Diary of a young girl-Anne Frank<br /><br />This is about a young girl and her family going into hiding because of the Holocaust. The Jewish people were taken from their homes and  put in concentration camps. Anne Frank was born in Germany in 1929.  I felt sad because if black people were in that situation with some government who told us to get out our homes and we were transported to concentration camp I wouldn't know what to do and it really touched me.  The way she wrote the book would make you think that she has a mind of a grown woman.  She gave good details about what they had to eat what was going on with the other seven people for example like one family is fighting another family.  The story she told made the characters sound very interesting I think the parts that the character play is for them and like that she put the book somewhere so her father can find it. I would recommend this book to all students that go to high school.
B000BTDMDC|5.0|A (beer) breath of fresh air! As a 20+ year vet of the music biz on both sides of the Atlantic, I have no hesitation in saying that this is the most stunning debut rock album since The Clash's. (Plus, I was there in '77 so I know what I'm talking about).
0345451325|4.0|This is for you, then!  I wasn't aware that there were any Halo books until after I beat Halo II.  I started searching the web for any more details to the great Halo story.  Then I saw these books, and a reference to Starhammer and the Vang series. <br /> <br />The Fall of Reach is a great read.  Even though the point of the Spartan program is to create a military \\"machine,\\" I couldn't help but see the Master Chief as more human after reading this.  The story seems rather fast paced, which keeps you turning pages. <br /> <br />I will say, though, that if you like this book, you should definately check out Starhammer.  If you think the Covenant are bad...
B0009A1AS2|4.0|OK, so I've had awhile to listen and contemplate this album, unlike previous DT releases, which I've reviewed nearly immediately. And I'm giving it 4 out of 5, unlike previous efforts. This would be a 4 1/2 if I could give that rating. I've come to the conclusion that Dream Theater has a pattern in their releases that has tended to target one of two different audiences - the first audience are more appreciative of a mellower, more restrained approach, more reminiscent of straight progressive rock. The second are more appreciative of a heavier, more metal sound & all out instrumental fireworks. So for example, Group 1 is more likely to appreciate \\"Six Degrees...\\" where Group 2 is more likely to appreciate \\"Train of Thought.\\" And what is interesting in reading reviews is to see how each of these camps takes sides w/ each album. The albums almost always get a good review, but the two sides tend to flip-flop between 4 and 5 stars, depending on their preference. Yet, in words, they speak in a way that appears to be at polar opposite sides, with 4 stars being very harsh in words, five stars literally GUSHING with praise. Well, I fall into BOTH categories, and I appreciate BOTH sides of this great band. I do favor one side slighlty over the other, but not significantly. <br /> <br />To tackle both of these sides, the typical Group 1 argument is that the flashy, \\"Train of Thought\\" side is too self-indulgent. My argument to that is this: Given the level of dedication to practice, the required level of concentration to execute, and the general complexity of this task - amongst ANY tasks of any kind - this is quite the opposite of self-indulgence. Self-indulgence would be spending as little time as possible ever practicing, then playing noodling, meandering eighth note pentatonic solos for 20 minutes. Quite the opposite of the precisely synchronized unison and harmony approach of Rudess/Petrucci. On to Group 2... The group 2 argument would be that playing something simple andcatchy is too far below musicians of this caliber and they are wasting technique and talent. My response to this side is that technique and talent can be utilized in a very subtle manner to convey simplicity to great impact. In other words, just because something is easy to play, doesn't mean the way the virtuoso plays it is the same as the way the average player plays it. There is far more to technique than raw dexterity.  <br /> <br />Luckily, Dream Theater appreciate both approaches & are not afraid to touch on either - or anything in between. <br /> <br />So on to Octavarium. Another great album by the most talented hard rock/metal/progressive band around. So why 4 1/2 and not 5 stars? Am I jumping in one camp or the other? No. There are several subtle reasons:  <br /> <br />1. I walk beside you - I'm afraid I'm going to have to join the legions of folks that don't like this song. While it is deftly executed and very melodic, it is just too cheesy for my tastes. <br /> <br />2. The Answer Lies within - This song is just too similar to \\"The Spirit Carries On,\\" from \\"Scenes...\\" I can't get past that.  <br /> <br />3. I like the \\"Root of all Evil\\" - I especially love the intro, but it just never quite takes it up a notch, like so many other Dream Theater heavy songs, and like the two predecessors in this series. I like the heaviness, but I think that a greater display of instrumental fireworks would have taken this from good to great, like the two predecessors.  <br /> <br />4. Overall - just a bit too restrained.  <br /> <br />So, let's remember, these are all to very minor degrees, which detract by a half star in my opinion. Since I couldn't make it 4 1/2, I dropped to 4 because I didn't want to diminish the impact of my opinion on previous efforts that have received 5 stars.  <br /> <br />Conclusion: This is yet another varied and dynamic masterpiece by one of the all-time greatest progressive metal bands. There is absolutely no reason not to buy this if you like this type of music. Dream Theater are the pinnacle of this style.  <br /> <br />In case you were wondering, Group 2 is where my slant lies (very slightly). Why? I refuse to accept anyones opinion of \\"self-indulgence\\" regarding extended, complex pieces of written music unless the writer can easily and deftly execute the passage they are criticizing. Dedicated musicians who can play this type of music RARELY, if ever, criticize simpler music on the basis of simplicity. It's usually non-musicians who happen to prefer busy, complex music that do that. Both groups should consider these facts, when trying to dig in on one side or the other.  <br /> <br />Besides, it's all just a bunch of opinions. And you know what those are like... :-)
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is obviously one of the best Civil War films ever made, with only Glory rivaling it.  Ronald Maxwell relied a great deal on Joshua Chamberlain's memoirs, and some people have a problem with that.  However, for the most part, the film is historically accurate and gives one an understanding of the feeling of battle.  Longstreet's ambivalence even comes across quite clearly.  At the same time, Maxwell does not lose sight of the fact that this is a dramatic movie, meaning to entertain as well as educate.  (This is something that Maxwell forgot when he directed the mediocre Gods and Generals.)  The DVD itself has a couple of nice extras.  A great bargain for the price.   This film deserves a two-disc presentation.
0571202284|5.0|I needed this book for my Traditional animation class and its been SO helpful. When it came down to the breaking down (redundant) of inbetweens and timing this book is great. I couldn't have done my run cycle or my walk cycle without it... and the ball bounces! Plus, it's written bu the guy who did \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\" How can you go wrong? Great book.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|I just picked this album up as an impulse buy today. i expected it to be terrible, but i was wildly impressed. it sounds more like Pink Floyd than the last 2 Pink Floyd albums did. sounds very mid-seventies. nice, simple production. beautiful, rolling songs, and Gilmour's unmistakable guitar presence.
B00000K29E|3.0|There seems to be some confusion about this album.  First, when initially released on Mainstream records in late '67, the title was, simply, Big Brother and the Holding Company.  No special mention of Janis. That came with the several reissues on Columbia. Also with those reissues came the inclusion of the tracks Last time and Coo Coo.  These songs were the A and B sides of a Mainstream single that was released along with the album.  In other words, they were bonus tracks.  Curiously, Coo Coo briefly made the top 100 in the pop charts.  I have several versions BBHC, including a mono copy on Mainstream, and this is the first time the material has sounded right.  The phase distortion that previously marred Janis's double-tracked vocals on Bye, Bye Baby is gone.  Also, the instrumentals seem to have been re-synched (could be my imagination or just the drugs), so the band sounds more competant.  The sound is as good as it's going to get and the price is right for this short, sweet slice of pre-history.  For me Intruder makes it all worth the while.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I couldn't wait to finally see this movie and it was well worth the wait.  The movie was very entertaining, scary and the best part was it was based on a true story.  The poor priest was on trial for Emily Rose's murder, trying to prove it was demons.  The doctors had other ideas.  I would have to say that even if it wasn't true, the priest really believed she was possessed.  He did what he thought was right and Emily also believed it.  It was her wish that he help her.  The lawyer he hired wasn't sure what to believe about the demon possession, but she did believe the priest did what he could and she knew he was a decent guy.  She fought very well for him and she was very smart.  I recommend this movie to people who can handle scary movies like this.
B000805796|5.0|I have said all along that Melanie C is superb and this album prooves just what tallent she has. If your not sure what the album sounds like then go to Melanies official website and listen to the one minute clips of each song. Beautiful Intentions is a great album and it is easy to listed to. Hits include Next Best Superstar which was realeased at number 10 in the English singles charts, Better Alone which Melanie decided not to release into the singles charts, instead she sold this song through her official website. And of course not forgeting First Day Of My Life, this song has reached number one in Germany, Spain, Sweden and im sure many others. It is yet to be released in England (Can't wait until it is!). Also the album has just reached number one in Portugal which is a massive acheivment for Melanie. Its what Melanie deserves aswell! <br /> <br />Its worth listening to this album you will love it, You'll Get Yours which is the last song on the album is my personal favourite. <br /> <br />Buy this album and you will not be dissapointed!
B000E6UK5K|5.0|With great anticipation, I bought the new Gilmour CD, expecting to be blown away by amazing guitar and that unmistakable voice.  The result....I was.  Others posting reviews are obviously expecting to hear the 2nd coming of Animals or Dark Side.  This is NOT Pink Floyd, but David Gilmour.  This CD shows what years and years of making great music can do to amazing artist like Gilmour.  He doesn't have to recreate Pink Floyd's sound, he IS Pink Floyd's sound.  This album shows a mature man who has been there and done that in the music business and is now doing the music that represents where he is in his life now, and it is amazing. <br /> <br />People need to not expect Pink Floyd, but to listen to the amazing guitar, and the voice and the great production value and listen to it back to back and you will be amazed with the content on this CD.  The best CD of this young year, and it will take a great effort by someone to top it.  Great work David!!  Just as I expected.

Bella del Se&ntilde;or, seguramente, dar&aacute; paso a un nuevo per&iacute;odo de sequ&iacute;a literaria con t&iacute;tulos por aqu&iacute; y por all&iacute; que olvidaremos m&aacute;s o menos r&aacute;pido. Porque Bella del Se&ntilde;or es ese tipo de obras que a usted nadie le menciona, nadie al menos en el mercado de lo actual, siempre tan elusivo y pasajero.<br /><br />Esta no es una novela sino varias. O si usted prefiere varias en una. Para levantar su magn&iacute;fico edificio, Albert Cohen escogi&oacute; la arquitectura loca, pero extremadamente rigurosa y severa, de Joyce, el padre fundador. Otros como &eacute;l lo han intentado con &eacute;xito (Alfred Doblin - Berl&iacute;n Alexanderplatz). Pero pocos como &eacute;l han conseguido reducir la arquitectura a m&uacute;sica, a la plenitud del relato en que las palabras y lo narrado son una y la misma cosa, en que no hay servicio de uno hacia otro sino simbiosis orquestal.

B000000OSG|4.0|This volume is generally considered to be the better of the two \\"Use Your Illusion\\" (UYI) albums (yes, I'd consider it a separate album, not just the second part of one large album:  UYI II is somewhat darker, more personal, and slower-paced and thus has a completely different mood than UYI I), and that fact is reflected in the sales and the overall public opinion.  I agree that this does have some classic songs, such as \\"Civil War,\\" \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\\" \\"Estranged,\\" and the Terminator 2 soundtrack \\"You Could Be Mine.\\"  As a matter of fact, in my opinion the first half this album (\\"Civil War\\" through \\"Breakdown\\") could likely stand up to just about anything else in the rock music world.  Neverheless, I beg to differ with the popular concensus---I do not think that UYI II is as good an album as UYI I.    First, I find the album to be a little disjointed, particularly in the second half (from the curious \\"Pretty Tied Up\\" through the end).  Plus, there are some moments that I find to be a little too dragged-out, disrupting the flow considerably and actually creating a little boredom.  In addition, the remake \\"Don't Cry,\\" though not a bad song per se, has very little effect due to the popularity of the original version.  Another thing is that there are lots of unneeded vocal effects throughout the album, which to me do more harm than good to a number of songs.    Because of these problems, I would recommend this for Guns N' Roses fans or for anyone who has only heard UYI I.  For everyone else, I must warn that though there are some really great tracks here, I suspect that you may find yourself hitting the \\"skip\\" or \\"fast-forward\\" buttons.
B00004YW6I|5.0|After hearing P.J. Harvey's RID OF ME for the first time, I must confess that I wasn't impressed. It was really quiet for some parts, then it became unbearably loud. It was a true pain to listen to. But  when my brother purchased this album and let me listen to it over a road-trip, I was more then impressed. I was uplifted. I was brought to musical ecstasy.<br /><br />The main reason this album excels is its emotion and its lyrics. P.J. Harvey really knows what the hell she is doing when it comes to making great music, and one can only cringe thinking an album like this was buried away within her for so long. Beyond the imaginative lyrics and blatant sensuality on some tracks (\\"This is Love,\\" anyone?), the music flows incredibly well and seems to be perfectly situated. Not a single note is out of place on this magnificent album, and that's a pretty large accomplishment.<br /><br />This album is the ultimate mood-swinger, too. If I'm feeling down, I don't go to Joy Division or the Cure. They usually depress me even more (but I still love them!). But this album truly makes my mood shift upwards. It's truly amazing.<br /><br />There's no bad tracks on  this album, but some stick out as truly outstanding. One of these is the duet with Thom Yorke  (from the band Radiohead) titled \\"The Mess We're In\\". The song seems to be angst-ridden, but it's nothing childish (Trent Reznor, I'm looking at you...). The whole album is mature, well produced, and well preformed. This CD simply rules.<br /><br />This is, hands down, my favorite album by a female-singer, and if her other albums were this good, she'd be my favorite female singer of all time (Bilinda Butcher holds that position in my book). I rate this album a solid 5 stars. STORIES BY THE SEA is a modern masterpiece, pure and  simple.
B00005JOII|4.0|At the heart of this movie lies a single question:  Is it better to be good or lucky?    Framing this question initially through a simple tennis metaphor, Woody Allen's film gradually expands its application to increasingly weightier matters.  And it is the many clever variations on this one theme that make this movie much more than a suspenseful drama.    The story line follows a former professional tennis player (played by Jonathan Rhys-Myers) as he climbs London's social ladder.  Self-made and incredibly charismatic, the audience can't help but like him at first, despite the calculating way in which he decides to marry into a wealthy British family notwithstanding his burning attraction to his future brother-in-law's girlfriend (played by Scarlett Johansson).     The pervasive use of opera as background music throughout the film both irritating and unnecessary, however, since the mounting sense of tragedy and drama comes through strongly enough thanks to the brilliant plotting and Hitchcock-like camera angles.    The ending, somewhat reminiscent of Allen's \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors,\\" answers the movie's central question in an unexpected way that's both appropriate and unsettling.
B000059HB7|5.0|\\"RIO BRAVO\\" will always stand out in my heart as how it was in the REAL WEST! The lawmen did the fighting and NOT the townspeople who were basically 'settlers'. The Civil war veterans, especially the Rebs, would have fought if asked.  <br />But John Wayne (as Sheriff John T. Chance) was no groveling wimp and with right on his side and a terrific group of fighters with him: Dean Martin as 'Dude' who proved his worth as an actor and a character as Wayne's sidekick who went off track for awhile but came back strong! Ricky Nelson, an actor since he was eight, plays 'Colorado Ryan'-a 17 year old gunslinger who uses his two guns to fight for the right and sings along with Dean Martin <br />and on his own,his wonderful voice and handsome looks adding just the right touch to the jailhouse scene.  <br /> <br />Many don't know it,but Ricky was a natural cowboy and perfect for the part because he was as low-key as his character. Johnny <br />Cash wrote a song for the movie called \\"Restless Kid\\" because they were friends. Real cowboys sang and played instruments to <br />keep their herd and horses relaxed. So that scene was very natural for the cowboy... <br /> <br />Walter Brennen as 'Stumpy' was made to look older and he did a <br />terrific job as loyal deputy despite his 'bum'leg. He made the character so REAL! There was a lot of comedy as well as action <br />in that movie. I loved the way they protected each other!  <br />Angie was great as a strong woman who was also very much a woman. There really IS a Rio Bravo in Texas,it flows into the Rio Grande and there were many small border towns in west Texas <br />that touch Mexico.  <br /> <br />I watched it again last night and always find it entertaining and hard to believe they made it in 1958. Sure Rick was chosen <br />for his superstar status,but John Wayne thought he was terrific! <br /> <br />Ward Bond was Wayne's friend as well and in many of his movies. <br />The whole cast was great and it's well-known to have beena 'happy set' which shows in the movie. I come from Southern and <br />cowboy stock and know a good Western when I see it. Young Colorado saving the Sheriff's life and the shoot-out at the end <br />proved they weren't just 'foolin' around'!  <br /> <br />\\"RIO BRAVO\\" is a movie loved around the world and always will be...   <br />
B000BGH22W|4.0|To say I have a fondness for orchestral movie soundtracks is a vast understatement.  I flock to them like moths to streetlights in summer.  And John Williams is the composer I consider among the best in the genre.  I have been a fan of his music since my childhood, growing up watching films he scored like the original Star Wars trilogy and ET.  I have thoroughly enjoyed his first three Harry Potter film scores and was disappointed when I heard the baton would be passed to Patrick Doyle for Goblet of Fire.<br /><br />That said, Patrick Doyle does an excellent job filling some awfully large shoes.  He does incorporate Williams' \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" in a few beginning tracks (what would a HP movie be without those familiar notes?), but from there he takes off in new directions.  He introduces the World Cup- the Irish represented by jig-like violins, the Bulgarians (and Krum) by low brass and cello/bass, surrounded by pulsating percussion.  With \\"Golden Egg\\" the track had me breathlessly reliving the First Task with its tension, then soaring on a musical Firebolt.  I enjoyed the two Waltzes, especially Potter's, incorporating the theme from \\"Harry in Winter\\".  I liked this new theme, although I found this track a bit long and not varying enough.  Some of the themes seem to be a bit more modern and not as rich with old-world music as the past soundtracks, but that may just be my interpretation.<br /><br />For the final music tracks, however, Doyle delivers.  It takes an enormous build, but by the end of the film score, I am in tears.  Patrick brings Voldemort to life with vivid starkness as well as Harry's anguish with sweeping strings and lush tones.<br /><br />One thing Patrick did that I have to say 'Well Done'- He gives Hogwarts a theme! \\"Hogwarts March\\" has a drive and a wonderful baudness, full of brass like any good school march should.  I hope it will be another continuing theme in subsequent movies.  Thank you- it was much needed.<br /><br />As for the final three tracks of the CD- they were created for the \\"Yule Ball\\" and the 'Weird Sisters' and are appropriate for the scenes.  I did find them amusing in the movie; and would like to find the written lyrics to \\"Do the Hippogriff\\" somewhere.  As for \\"Magic Works\\", this may be the only Harry Potter movie with a sung song in its end credits (unless the producers create a 'Celestina Warbeck' in another movie- oh, please God, no), and it's an enjoyable ballad to end with.<br /><br />Maybe Bill and Fleur will use it as their wedding song.hey were created for the \\"Yule Ball\\" and the 'Weird Sisters' and are appropriate for the scenes.

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|Ok, the guys are good woth classic rock but, please, be more original! Juicebox starts with the Peter Gunn Theme, Heart in a Cage is Iggy Pop's top chart The Passanger, and so on. Now, I am fine if you look at that background but then move on or go for a cover album. Nevertheless, the CD is entertaining and perharps it can draw pop-addicted teens to classic rock while pushing them to look for the roots.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Let's cut to the chase.  Great heavy riffs, stunning melodies and harmonious singing, staggering musicianship and songwriting. Great classically influenced arpeggios over monstrous riffing - a music that actually lifts you.  It has been ages since I've heard such an exciting and original album in this present genre of rock/metal.  NO AWFUL GROWLING, SCREAMING YELLING - the worst thing that has ever happened in metal, and needs to stop, because it ruins so many records. The negative points are the use of explicit swear words.  There are enough words in the English language to express ourselves without having to resort to foul language.  Also a band that is this talented doesn't need to resort to ridiculous names, just use your real names.  I am going to see this band live tomorrow night and I shall tell them what a highly original and musical album they have produced and they don't need to let themselves down by the above. <br />People, this album is quite possibly the future of rock/metal music.  If you are at all musical, you will love this album.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I was invited to see this movie at the request of a coworker. Little did I know that I would leave the theater a changed person. I have subsequently seen it on two other occasions, once alone, so that I could just sit there in privacy and absorb the enormous flood of emotions that flowed from the characters.  Never has such a movie touched so many.  All around the world, I write to others who have been altered by this film.  Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall embodied the souls of every person denied the freedom to love. <br /> <br />This is not a gay movie.  My husband and I are both \\"straight\\" yet were profoundly effected by its message of the power of love. <br /> <br />Since I have seen it, I can't stop thinking about it.  It haunts my every dream. <br /> <br />How unfortunate that some members of the Academy refused to see the movie. Never before has a film that won the Golden Globe and so many other awards been bypassed for the Oscar.  Somehow it seems unfair to the point of being suspicious.
B0000029J5|5.0|I just love Keb' Mo'.  This CD is classic Mo'.  It does not have the unevenness of the Scorsese collection, which included the impromptu \\"Letter to Tracy,\\" --a mistake to include.  All of the tracks on this collection have individual strengths that enhance my overall view of Keb'Mo's virtuosity.   <br /> <br />His lyrics are so contemporary, yet, he places them in a comfortable folksy/blues ambience that feels very comfortable.
0684824906|4.0|I admit, I only opened this book because I received it as a gift.  I'm generally a fiction reader, and I always thought books on history to be like reading a text book, not the kind of thing I would want to relax and enjoy for a couple hours at a time.  Though I struggled through the first 100 pages of tedious character development, I've come away thoroughly fascinated by the series of events that led to Lincoln's election, his conduct - right and wrong - of the war, and the enduring signifigance that he had on our National history.   <br /> <br />I'm no presidential historian, but it would seem to me that the concurrence of national tension, personal tragedy, political upheaval, catastrophic defeat, and ultimate victory are unparalleled with respect to what Lincoln endured.  Goodwin's character portrayal of Lincoln, his rivals, and his adversaries (who were sometimes one and the same) makes this book impossible to put down.  I'm now so fascinated with the topic, I've rented the 'Civil War' series by Ken Burns so that I can reconcile what I've learned of the political history of the era from 'Team of Rivals' to the military and social history presented in Burns' documentary. <br /> <br />I highly recommend 'Team of Rivals', I think it's important and enjoyable reading.
B000009RC2|4.0|Of course this is one of the classic fusion recordings; I just wish the studio work (mixing, acoustic design, etc.) were up to the same level as the music.

B0002OERI0|2.0|At first, I really liked the single \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" and then \\"Holiday.\\"  After hearing them so often on the radio, I got sick of them. I did not like \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends.\\"  I thought that song seemed to drone on and on. <br /> <br />After hearing those songs, I decided to not buy it, but go to the library and pick it up and listen first, which I'm glad I did.  I only found a few tracks off of the whole cd that were decent. <br /> <br />I don't have much to say, but if you were a big fan of Dookie, you're going to be let down with this album.  Greenday has completly changed their style of music.

B000002KNI|4.0|Even through I wasn't living when Simon & Garfunkel re-united to do a free concert in New York's Central Park. And even through it was a free concert, but I bet that if they did sold tickets, that the concert would be sold out, and any time that they can get Simon & Garfunkel on the same stage pefroming together. So I would have to envy the 500,000 + people that were at this concert. You would see the show on PBS, and added up buying the dvd, but both on video tape, and audio of this show, you are still missing stuff. The songs are Mrs. Robinson, Homeward Bound, America, Me and Julio down by the schoolyard, Scarborugh Fair, April come she will, Wake up little Suize, Still crazy after all these years, American tune, Late in the evening, Slip slidin' away, A heart in New York, Kodachrome/Maybelliene, Bridge over troubled water, Fifty ways to leave your lover, the boxer, Old friends, the 59th street bridge song (feelin' groovy), the sound of silence. Most of the show is made up Paul Simon's solo songs, after they disbanded in 1970 after the release of Bridge over troubled water, and Art Garfunkel joins Paul Simon on most of his solo songs expect for Still crazy after all these years and Fifty ways to leave your lover. On the cd, you are missing 2 songs, the late great Johnny Ace, and a reprise of Late in the evening. On the cd you hear Art say to the aduidence, that the next song he is going going to do is the almost only non Paul Simon song in the show is A heart in New York, and that is right after Slip slidin' away, on the video tape of the show, when they end the song it just fades to black, and I also notiuce some additonal music, and both of them, introucing the band, but they don't annouce them on the shoe all togehter until the start of the reprise of Late in the evening, even through we o see Paul Simon introuce Stevie Gadd on drums after he signs fifty ways to leave your lover, other then those things the dvd andthe cd are just great, in less I have forgottensomething else.
0761129235|4.0|Dr. Maurer's book combines kaizen, the Japanese business model of incremantal but steady improvement, with a self-help book.  This book is easy to read (I read it in one day) and is packed with ideas for personal improvement.  The heart of kaizen is that a drastic improvement in behavior (such as going from a sedentary lifestyle to exercising an hour a day) is daunting, but a small change in behavior is easy (going from a sedentary lifestyle to four minutes of vigorous exercise a day).  The only reason that I did not give it five stars is because I wish that the book was longer with more examples of kaizen for individuals.
B000002NJS|5.0|The Disk is without discussion the best one from Madonna. Ray of Light made me a fan of Madonna, since i have ever thougt listen to her music. <br /> <br />Drowned World, and some other songs, are an artistic play of the instruments, and make her one of the best music creator, because of the conbinations of instruments and sounds, mixing basic electric guitar with MIDI sounds.  This combinations made the songs unpredictible, only until you listen to them a few times. <br /> <br />Is a great album, if i could get it 6 stars, i'll do it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you have SciFi tunnel-vision and can't think outside of the universes created by George Lucas and Gene Roddenberry, i.e. your sci-fi MUST have non-human aliens, ONLY fancy, hi-tech gadgets/weaponry, faster-than-light speed, and every other sci-fi cliche spawned by Star Wars/Star Trek, then Serenity probably isn't for you. <br /> <br />However, if you can imagine a future where, well, it's just us humans, and practical folks use what they can to get by, then you'll like \\"Serenity\\".   <br /> <br />This is not the pristine and polished Federation of Star Trek or the grand and noble Republic of the Star Wars prequels.  Josh Whedan has created an interesting and practical universe and future for mankind, where people still use six shooters and shotguns because they are (probably) cheap and cost effective.  High tech weapons exist, but are likely expensive and probably controlled and regulated by the government. The rogue crew of Serenity barely scrapes by enough to fill their six shooters, much less afford high tech weapons. <br /> <br />I gained a whole new level of respect for this movie when I read somewhere that the budget was only 30-40 million, which is peanuts for big screen scifi.  The special effects certainly weren't groundbreaking, but they were far from cheesy, in fact the FX were pretty darned good.  The lighting in the movie was fantastic and deserved a nod from one of the snotty Hollywood awards programs. <br /> <br />I'd never heard of any of the cast, but they did a fine job, especially the guy who played \\"Mal\\", this guy is going to be big someday.  The dialog was some of the best I've ever heard.  Snappy, witty, and down-right fun.  The whole movie was an interesting mix of funny and serious.  Funny scenes could turn on a dime and suddenly be dramatic, and vice-versa.  This may also turn off mainstream viewers, who tend to want their movies to be strictly comedies, dramas, actions, etc. <br /> <br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Serenity\\".  It's certainly worthy of a place in my DVD collection and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fresh, original scifi with a witty twist. <br /> <br />I'd also like to see more of this Serenity crew, so I may even buy the Firefly series the movie was based on.

B000DWMYQ8|4.0|I had heard that \\"Chicken Little\\" was a big disappointment and it did not get one of the three Oscar nominations for Best Animated Feature, but I thought it was an enjoyable film.  I just watched \\"Madagascar\\" this past week and one advantage this Disney offering has is that kids should enjoy it more than adults, which was the whole point of animated films once upon a time (although mom and dad will certainly recognize more of the songs).  This 2005 animated offering begins with the infamous day that Chicken Little (voiced by Zach Braff), told everyone the sky was falling.  His father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) finds an acorn, but his son insists is was a blue object shaped like a stop sign.  Jump ahead a year, and Chicken Little is trying to live down his moment of infamy (the movie and bumper stickers make it difficult), and to earn the respect of his father, who was the best baseball player in the town's history.<br /><br />Chicken Little has a small company of good friends, Abby Mallard (Joan Cusak), who is the Ugly Duckling, Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), who is twice as big at CL's father, and Fish Out of Water (Dan Molina), who finds fun things to do with his breathing helmet.  Their primary concern is not with their small friend's story of the sky falling, but rather the strained relationship between Chicken Little and his father.  The kid wants to do something that will impressive his father, or at least not make him ashamed of his undersized kid.  Crossing the street is a hardship for our hero, especially when there is a piece of gum on the road, but when tryouts are announced for baseball he decides to tryout.  He is assigned number \\"0\\" and usually sits on the bench.  It is Foxy Loxy who proves to be the big star on the team, but then comes the big game.<br /><br />What I admired about this film is that the movie sets up the idea that if Chicken Little can have his one moment of glory that will change everything.  Then it makes it clear that is not the way things work.  Besides, we have not gotten to the point where everybody learns that Chicken Little was not making up things when he said the sky was falling, because the piece of sky shaped like a stop sign comes back, and this time it is not alone.  This requires the sky to literally be falling, and they do manage to come up with a way in which that is clearly true.  The animation is not cutting edge, but the point here is the story and not what the computers can do.  That is why some of the best bits are simply when the animals act like really animals.  The only real problem with \\"Chicken Little\\" is that there is a point where what appears to be really bad things start happening, but we are supposed to think they are funny instead of frightening.  That is a thin line to try and walk, and that is the point where this film might get a bit confusing for little kids.  Of course, from the second time on that will no longer be a problem.<br /><br />Familiar voices in the cast include Don Knotts as Mayor Turkey Lurkey, Wallace Shawn as Principal Fetchit, Patrick Stewart as the teacher Mr. Woolensworth, and Harry Shearer as the Dog Announcer.  Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara, Adam West, and Patrick Warburton lend their voices as well, but telling who they are playing would give away too much of the story.  Yes, I know that I am not giving away as much as the trailer for \\"Chicken Little\\" does, but at least the voices can be a surprise for the older viewers, who are the only ones who are going to smile when they suddenly hear the voice of Adam West.<br /><br />The Backstage Disney bonus features include some deleted scenes, including a trio of alternate openings.  One abandoned opening was a more traditionally animated version of the story of Chicken Little, made poignant because it is narrated by Don Knotts, who passed away last week.  There is also \\"Hatching 'Chicken Little',\\" A \\"Making Of\\" featurette, and a \\"Where's Fish?\\" Trivia Game.  When you get to the Music & More section you will find some karaoke sing along and music videos by The Cheetah Girls (\\"Shake a Tail Feather\\") and Barenaked Ladies (\\"One Little Slip\\").  Plus, my DVD came with a free \\"Chicken Little\\" tattoo bandage, which was pretty sweet (I got the one with all four of the gang instead of one of the four with one apiece, which is kewl).ic & More section you will find some karaoke sing along and music videos by The Cheetah Girls (\\"Shake a Tail Feather\\") and Barenaked Ladies (\\"One Little Slip\\").

Will has an arch nemesis on campus and someone is watching the Stronghold's secret lair.  Will Will develop any powers to help cope with these problems?<br /><br />This movie is supposed to be mindless fun for the young and young at heart, and it succeeds mightily.  All the actors do a great job, especially the mostly unknown teen cast.  The adults in the film have fun with their rolls.  Everyone's trying to do a good job but have fun at the same time, and that spirit draws you into the film.  I especially enjoyed Lynda Carter's brief appearances as the school principal, and she gets the best line out of the entire movie.<br /><br />The plot, on the other hand, is fairly predictable for anyone who has seen a Disney family film before.  I had most everything figured out before it happened, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie for one minute.  Being a high school movie, it has many cliches from that genre as well, but with a clever superhero twist.  The special effects are decent and help draw you into the film.<br /><br />The DVD is nothing special, but it gets the job done.  The wide screen picture and full surround sound are great.  Extras include a music video (Bowling for Soup with \\"I Melt with You\\"), bloopers, behind the scenes, stunts, and an alternate opening.  Of these, the only one really worth watching is the alternate opening.  It's fun and helps fill in a couple plot points from the movie better.<br /><br />This is the perfect movie to watch with the family or after a long week when you just want to relax.

B000000Y2F|5.0|Okay, so only like 2 out of 8 people found my original review helpful, which wasn't cutting it for me.  So here is the new and improved review:     Sprawling piano and erratically-wonderful saxophone will amaze you.  The synchronicity with which these two masters play intricate movements together is amazing, but besides that this album is just a great foray into standard American jazz of the late 50's/early 60's.  It seems as though these two gentlemen were made to play together.  This album is held together by a ragtime feel with Monk's piano and further glimpses into the avant-garde with Coltrane's sax.  If you enjoy jazz, this album should be in your collection.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|This isn't the type of scratch fest that Mixmaster Mike or DJ Q-bert puts out.  It's a collage of influences and some mad scientist rendering of those influences.  It's fun, quirky, cool stuff, with just the dash of soul that J Dilla was known for.  Without a rapper in sight, this one's for anyone who likes their hip-hop served up with the philosphies of jazz and beat-mixing: take the lead, then swing it.<br /><br />RIP, J Dilla.  What a great note to go out on.
B000002ADT|5.0|A classic, and my favorite Miles album.  If you are just getting into jazz this is a good album to start with.  Although jazz can be hard for some people to wrap their minds around, this is a very listener-friendly album, while at the same time showcasing enough innovation to impress the most learned musicians...it is a very 'chill' album that is great for driving as well as relaxing around the house...or relaxing period...great album!
B000EGDC14|5.0|This is without a doubt, the best type of pop music i have ever heard in my life! Supernature portrays a different but pleasing ontake of music rather than the glamourous black cherry, or the mysterious felt mountain. Yes it's true, they're starting to sound a bit more like everyone else (although a bit over a lightyear away from it) however this album has a great and undescribably unique quality to it too!!  <br /> <br />Somethings that do stick out as new and genuine would have to be the song Satin chic, or number one.  Those two tracks are by far the most convienent things ever. closer to the much loved black cherry are songs such as You never know, lovely 2 c u, time out from the world, or perhaps even beautiful. If you can imagine those 10 tracks in black cherry with a little more of a musical maturity to it, then youve got something around supernature.  <br />I think it's safe to say that they've pretty much summed up and said goodbye to any trace of felt mountain in this new album. however on songs like let it take you, and time out of the world, there is the faint voice of it, however it sounds more like a more electronic reindition of hairy trees more than it does a felt mountain song.  <br />Alright aside from all that I'd say to anyone..,Buy this album if you are either a huge fan of black cherry, fan of goldfrapp. or perhaps even want a really, REALLY amazing dance album!! listen to this album once and it'll have you dancing all day long!!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|\\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is happy music.  The CD is a continuous string of dance music and is a joy.
078681859X|4.0|I bought the book for my 12-year-old nephew who adored it and made me read it and I am glad he did. Especially after the disappointment HP 5-6 caused me, I found this book refreshing and entertaining. It was a clever idea to present the story from two different point of views: Nathaniel's (talented apprentice to a mediocre wizard) and Bartimaeus' (the Djinni, summoned by Nathaniel to do some dirty work for him). The two characters are as different, as the two points of views, but they soon find themselves in a situation where their survival depends on their cooperation.<br /><br />For me, the main character was Bartimaeus, the Djinni. I found his self-obsessed and self-centred approach to the world hilarious and intriguing. At last a perfect imperfect hero, or rather, two imperfect heroes, for fortunately Nathaniel isn't the epitome of goodness either.<br /><br />The only flaw was the style of writing that could have been better even if you don't expect high-brow literature from children's books, but still! If you are in search of some refreshing and entertaining adventure book, this is it!
B000002G6J|5.0|Listen to the samples and you will not need anyone's comments. \\"Wave\\", \\"Tide\\", \\"Stone flower\\" and the rest of the albums with Jobim's music  will live for ever. Smooth, relaxing, stylish.
B0001611DI|5.0|Product was in excellent shape, shipping time was within stated time frame.  All in all, it was a smooth, effortless transaction.  It will be a great pleasure to do business with this seller again!

B000009QOC|5.0|This is everything I want in a good rock album.  One good song after another.  Best songs are..... almost every one!  On this album Danzig shows that they can rock out, go all the way blues, and write slow rock that is pleasent to the ears.  Glenn shows amazing control of his voice on this album, Christ guitaring really shines, and Chuck is better than ever.  I recomend this to ANY fan of rock, metal, etc.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|An excellent cast is almost completely wasted in this production, in which Austen's rich characters, social commentary, ascerbic wit, and wonderful language are stripped away to make room for a banal, brooding romance.  <br /> <br />For the Austen reader the film's main attraction is the intellectual appeal of its attempt to present a different interpretation of the novel. (Warning... be prepared for some really, really, really clumsy editing, writing and adaptation.) In addition to that, and to its lush, if greasy, production values, there is consolation in the wonderful form of Judi Dench, the first actress to create a truly intimidating Lady Catherine - hence the two-star, rather than a one-star, rating. <br /> <br />To the non-Austen reader, in search of a cute movie, this is likely just the ticket. <br /> <br />If you're thinking of buying it, though, I'd wait for a year or so... by then the novelty should have worn off and the price cut by quite a bit. <br />
0062502182|5.0|To paraphrase the Confucian phrase: \\"What the superior person seeks is within, what the small person seeks is in others.\\" Coehlo's parable about a young shepherd's trek to find a great treasure  makes that quote the crux of its simple yet profound point. <br /> <br />Written in a clear, tight prose that still manages to paint a beautiful epic feel, The Alchemist is a great story to read when you're feeling overwhelmed by it all. A petite book, it's a great traveling companion and a quick read.
B000006045|5.0|This is, without a doubt, a groundbreaking album, both in terms of musicianship and production. Their latest release (100th Window) is unbelievably disappointing in comparison to this!!! <br /> <br />For those who like the ambience and energy of this CD may I recommend Disparities by Advokat...demonstrates what Royksopp is missing perhaps?
B000C79UKC|5.0|_Ray Bradbury clearly carried the Western Frontier of Walt Whitman and Horace Greely to the Martian Frontier in this classic novel. If 1950's America would have had the rocket ships, and an inhabitable destination, planetary colonization would probably have gone very much like this. As the text says:\\" They were coming with small dreams or large dreams or none at all. But a government finger pointed from four-color posters in many towns:THERE'S WORK FOR YOU IN THE SKY: SEE MARS!\\" Heck, I'd go right now if I could.<br /><br />_His Mars is the essense of the wild frontier: the path finders, the pioneers, the pilgrims, the homesteaders, the townsfolk, the eccentrics- and then the bureaucrats.... Bradbury's Martians are haunting and tragic- and fare about as well as the Plains Indians in the face of \\"progress.\\"<br /><br />_Actually, this story parallels the story of American West a little too closely- especially when it talks of the \\"silent towns.\\" If you've ever seen the dead and dieing farm towns of the plains you know what I mean.<br /><br />A word of caution- many \\"hard\\" science fictions fans do not like Bradbury. That is because he is a poet and a magician weaving a rare, ephemeral atmosphere. Do you have the sensitivity and the soul to follow?
B00006RCNW|5.0|Is it worth bending, sometimes breaking, the law to make life better for those you're protecting.  Vic Mackey and his Strike Team makes a very strong case in Season 1 of The Shield.  You may not like Vic and his tactics by the end of the first episode, but he'll probably have you convinced by the end of the season.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Leave it to Stephen King to give us yet another great book which was the inspiration for this movie. Although a very long movie, \\"It\\" delivers!!! A great cast with great acting! Especially Tim Curry who plays the clown \\"Pennywise\\". What a cool and spooky clown. Without going into the long story behind this movie, I will say that if you are a Stephen King fan, and you haven't seen this movie, please do for it's worth it and you won't be disappointed. Full of thrills and twists, \\"It\\" entertains from beginning to end. Great justice to the book.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Way too many comical fight scenes. Terrible story.  There seemed to be way too many cookie cutter scenes, influenced from various sources, such as;  The Warriors, Close Encounters, The Warriors, Chips, Star Wars, and a J-Lo video. <br /> <br />This film really needed an editor, some of the dialogue just drags on and on and on.... <br />   <br /> <br />The first movie was very good, but please, for your own sake, skip this one.
6305546789|5.0|As a huge Halloween fan owning all 8 movies, I must say that John Carpenter gave us a true classic in both Halloween (the movies) and the character of Michael Myers! Halloween Part 1 will always be a classic! True scary movie and the coolest soundtrack I've ever heard in a movie..... just LOVE the Halloween theme!! This original is full of suspense and creepiness from beginning to end. With a wonderful cast..... Jamie Lee Curtis playing Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasence playing Dr. Loomis, Halloween will forever be remembered as a TRUE horror movie...... that has set the standard for horror movies ever since!!!!!
B0007PAMR4|1.0|I love Herberet's books. I am an avid fan of Lynch's original release... and i had to force myself to actually make it through the \\"extended\\" version. A director makes cuts for a reason. Adding an extra five seconds at the end of a shot when a character has finished speaking his lines is not \\"extending\\" a film, it is ruining its pace. Adding in a few lines of dialogue that were cut is not \\"extending\\" a movie, it is cluttering its flow. and worst of all, changing the soundtrack to accomodate these extra 10-20 second tidbits is not \\"extending\\" a movie, it is eviscerating one of the most intense aspects of dune. finally, dubbing dialogue so obviously it is no longer synched to the character's lips is... well just baffling really. <br />For those who like lynch's original, spare yourself the agony of sitting through this; most of the \\"extra\\" scenes are tidbits added here and there that ruin the tension of the original, without adding more information. the introduction itself sets the tone: it looks like a grade-schooler's expirements with i-movie. all it shows is a camera panning around some of the production art, with a terrible narration voice over. this is not a movie, it looks more like a special features storyboard-to-animation sequence. <br />i am insulted someone would decide to pass this off as an \\"extended\\" version. ALL films cut a lot of footage out of their final cuts FOR A REASON. collecting all the extra garbage and jamming it into the original only makes the original stink. <br />oh... and did i mention they messed up the soundtrack?...
6305291446|5.0|In this 7th installment of the Halloween series, Jamie Lee Curtis returns in her role as Laurie Strode, however this time she has changed her name, in order to hide from her brother Michael. She is the head mistress of a high posh school. She now has a grown up son who is finally fed up with Strode's inability to forget her brother and what has happened to her many years ago. It's now 20 years since Halloween 1 and Strode fears that her brother is going to be back for her anyday. Well, her fears come true as Michael finds her and he's back! Now Strode must face her brother in the ultimate showdown.  Another great sequel for being the 7th sequel. We have not been let down yet, except for part 3.
B0009NZ3BO|4.0|I am not a 70's Prog expert or music theory critic by any means... but I seriously feel ALL the albums by Gentle Giant are worth owning. I would highly reccommend Interview for a new fan of GG. This one is a great place to start because it's accessible, diverse in sound and hints at the sophisticated greatness that is more potent in the famous Giant catalogue (aka Octopus, Glass House, Freehand). In short I wish I had started my exploration of this band with Interview. It's a mild stretch in a long run of very sophisticated recordings. Gentle Giant, like King Crimson, almost seems \\"too smart\\" for the average ear. Their \\"toned down\\" material is still light years beyond average American rock and will entertain and reward without too much intimidation. Interview is mildly reserved, a little bit uneven and definitely not Gentle Giant flexing their musical muscle (as on Octopus & Glass House where their insane chops run rampant!), but it is worth owning without any doubt. <br /> <br />If Interview sits well with you then embrace and enjoy the reality that future purchases will only get wilder! Enjoy the ride with this band. Gentle Giant is a diamond in the rough.
6305971099|5.0|Halloween part 5 picks up from part 4 perfectly!! With yet another great performance from Donald Pleasence and Danielle Harris, Part 5 is just as good as part 4. Myers is yet again after his niece, back in Haddonfield. Moustapha delivers yet again. And the Halloween Theme...... the movies wouldn't be the same without it! Another great sequel to one of the greatest horror movie series of all time!!!
B000E6UK5K|5.0|The reviews for OAI are always going to be fairly wide-ranging. The people expecting OAI to sound like a 30 year old Pink Floyd album (possibly because they've only just discovered Pink Floyd in the last couple of years) are in for a shock. But for anyone that's followed David's career right through from the early days of Pink Floyd, this album is the next logical step for the master craftsman that he certainly is.  <br />10 beautiful slow paced multi layered songs that just sweep you along, reminding you that sometimes it's just good to be happy. Highly recommended to anyone who likes chilling out with the headphones on. The sound of Pink Floyd in 2006. <br />Of cause if you're a Britney fan.... Stick to Britney.
B000C65Z1G|3.0|I must agree with the last reviewer this movie does lead you to believe a lot of things. For one because Ralph Fiennes is holding a gun on the front of the DVD you would think he uses it. Ralph doesn't even get the gun until the last thirty minutes and it stays in his pocket the entire time. They put all of the good-looking scenes on the cover but they don't let you know that you'll be spending your entire day trying to finish this film. The movie is worth seeing at least once but I doubt if you'll want to keep it after seeing it so it's better to rent it. Good for the director of City Of God for a decent film but this is no City Of God and I say this because there are some similarities between the two films.<br /><br />The acting couldn't save this but it was a good effort, Ralph does hold it up and he is most of the reason why you stick with the film until the end. I wasn't even aware that this was a story with a little love until I saw Ralph driving in the middle of nowhere talking to a Rachel Weisz that wasn't there. Rachel didn't play her character well in the love department. If your looking for a movie with some action don't look here but if you want a good story and a way to waste a day then this is what you want.
B000068PQ0|5.0|To begin, I have not generally been a faithful follower of the Flaming Lips. My only chance listening was many years ago when I heard the song She Don't Use Jelly (Vaseline), and I thought, Ummmm...Okaaay.  <br />That was it for me and the Flaming Lips until years later when I happened to hear a track off Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. A friend was playing it in her car and I was completely besotted with the music.  <br />\\"Who is this?\\" I demanded.   <br />\\"Flaming Lips,\\" she said. <br />\\"Flaming Lips? You mean that Vaseline song band?\\" <br />\\"Uh-huh.\\" <br />I bought the album so fast, and couldn't stop listening to it, haven't been able to stop for years. For me, nearly every single track on it is extremely good, ranging from punchy rhythms to melodic sounds and lyrics. The main vocals (I believe it's Mark Coyne who sings?)reminded me at times of Neil Young (who I also love), and were often haunting, hypnotic. The music itself gave off this quality, but it's hard in this case to separate and single out area which was better than another as the sounds were so compatible - this work was clearly a shared effort, and that's something you rarely find these days.      <br />Don't get me wrong - I am not saying everyone will love this album; tastes differ, to each his/her own, blah blah blah. And obviously the Flaming Lips is a band which cannot be easily boxed into any one style of music without deviation (except for that category called 'Alternative' , and in my opinion there's been little room to move even in THAT section).  <br />I appreciate the enormous talent and work which went into this. This is not a slap-dash release. Listening to this album, one can hear and feel the amount of work that went into it. It's tight, polished, worked and drawn out, but not to the point of sterility. The result is one serious work of creativity,  the kind of music that can make you feel like you're in another world altogether.  <br />If you don't love the album, you can at least respect it.  <br />I , on the other hand, just happen to love it.
048623231X|5.0|Excellent printout and price.  Just get it!
B0000025DV|5.0|great cd we have been waiting for years for this to come out to replace our treasured vinyl
B000002B2T|3.0|I'll be brief and straight to the point(the way Layne would have liked it): this album does NOT rock. <br /> <br />This album is a very tranquil, controlled production. 'I Don't Know Anything' somewhat contains that grinding Alice In Chains sound, but even then it comes nowhere close to anything AIC. <br />  <br />At first glance it looks like a Seattle Dream Team, however there were ulterior motives for recording this album. Layne Staley mostly did this just as a f*** you to Alice In Chains, because Jerry Cantrell had carved up the band and held producers hostage demanding more singing. Mike Mcready did this while Eddie Vedder was in his own world of delusion, trying to come back to reality. And Barrett Martin? Well, to be honest he just needed some work. Screaming Trees were not excatly Nirvana or Soundgarden for a well deserved reason. <br /> <br />This album was an anomaly, and if you really examine it you easily see how redundant and uninspired it is.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|What's so amazing about the Strokes is that they have not released one bad song yet. Their entire catalog is flawless and they continue that streak with this album. Anyone who claims to know one thing about music must appreciate the groove factor that lies within this album. Quite simply, the best band making music today.
B000A88F22|1.0|Egglplant was right when he wrote his review, society does have a long way to go. Why is this even close to 3 stars?

0553573403|5.0|This book is engaging and wonderful.  The characters are complex and real.  At times this leaves the reader unsure of who is a hero vs. villain.  Yet this complexity is part of the strength of this series.<br /><br />The fully wrought world is characteristic of Tolkein.  The heft of the book, complexity and detail is like Clancy. (both of these are broad stroke comparisons)<br /><br />While this is not a neatly packaged story with a classic character arc, the reader is still captured and involved with the characters and their interwoven stories.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|One of the most beautiful things I've heard in the last few years. Listening to the first few notes of Gustavo's opening piece makes me well up, transporting me back to that mountain in Wyoming. Powerful, like the movie, and absolutely amazing work.
B000BIQKXM|1.0|This is just another example of Westlife's lack of originality and creativity (even without that horrid Brian), again as so often before its still chockablock full of coverversions - Plain boring, dull, uninpirational and depressing again! - No thanks!
0634022296|5.0|This book is a great source for novices and pros alike. Not only does it provide chords for every Beatle song but they are in the correct keys!!
B0000CDL93|5.0|Whether you believe the conspiracy theories or not JFK is an extremely effective and gripping movie that will never once leave you bored or checking your watch in it's 3hr+ running time. I'd say it's one of the great \\"American\\" films with an all star cast that even gives love to Newman and Uncle Buck! It's an awesome achievement that is in fact, awesome and probably Oliver Stone's best movie. In the double disc DVD the conspiracies documentary is also a big plus. I'm an old timey conservative and i still thought this movie was great, so if you're thinking about getting it don't hesitate.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I love this cd as I love the singing voice of Norah Jones.  This cd has alot of great songs on it. <br />
B000E97Y6K|5.0|This movie wraps itself around you; all 3 hrs of it. There are a couple of parts where I wish the blanket were trimmed, but they fade into insignificance; at best they would have shaved off a few minutes. So, who cares?<br /><br />Why the 'wrapping' metaphor? Because this movie is all about that elusive story-element called 'pay off'. KK is a masterpiece, not only of re-telling a classic and archetypal tale of Beauty and Beast, but also of almost perfect closure of every foreshadowing-pay-off element in sight.<br /><br />It starts with the music. \\"I'm sitting on top of the world\\".... Has it ever sounded more sinister, ominous and bitterly satirical? Caged animals and food-lines. The dead giant surrounded by roaches-sorry, 'people'. Yes, here as well, with every line of the song, there's build-up that ultimately finds closure. Later the captain talks about roaches. The giant insects and leeches in the ravine. The milling crowds streaming into the theater. The milling crowds surrounding the fallen giant. Everything fits together. I watched it thrice and I've yet to find an event that didn't have closure. Even the interminable dino-stampede had a fore-shadowing purpose, but I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure it out.<br /><br />Jackson of course delights in overdoing his creatures; the appellation 'Giant Weta' suddenly assumed new meaning. Real 'Giant Wetas' can be quite sizable and look pretty intimidating; not for the faint-hearted. Jackson just took the name and ran with it. Masking the story-telling significance of the events by making it gruesome and quite scary. That's the way to do it. I don't know if Jackson is fully aware of what he did-sometimes these things are gut decisions, not necessarily cerebral-but whatever prompted him to make his directorial and editing decisions...it worked.<br /><br />The Beauty and the Beast. Here, too, is something that most other reviewers missed. Because it isn't a 'love'-story between human and simian at all. That's how it was sold to us, and everybody bought it; but it's so much more subtle and, dare I say it?, 'perceptive'. Those who see the story as the boy-girl thing between ape and girl will miss it altogether.<br /><br />The real 'love' story actually _is_ between Ann and Jack. He's the human analogue to the ape, the one who can be what the ape cannot-and who ultimately _is_ what he ought to be. The 'love' story between KK and Ann is more subtle-it is the tale of two creatures, from different worlds, who discover that beauty is...ahh, did you think I was going to say 'transcendent'? Well, possibly that's what Jackson intended to convey, but it could just as easily be understood as beauty simply everywhere, but until it is perceived it might as well not be. That, of course, is the essence of beauty: that it is indeed in the eye of the beholder, for 'beauty' is always 'beauty-perceived'; there is none other.<br /><br />KK is also about 'nobility'; something usually ignored or downgraded in its importance in most films made at the moment. The ape is savage, because he has to be in order to survive. Yielding to softer aspects of one's nature is lethal in that world; even apes can be brought down, in this instance by the closest thing to human existing in that island-enclosure, namely those gargoylish bats; on the mountain top, where KK, and others of his kind, appear to have gone before: the top of their world, whence they could watch beauty; the only kind available here, dimly understood, yet perceived: a sunset. Now KK takes the one other creature whom he has perceived as 'beautiful' to that same, dangerous place; but this time, while he is not killed himself by the sharp-toothed creatures tearing at him, it is by their agency that Ann is taken from him-and also by her human love, Jack, of course; with her, one must emphasize, complete collusion-he is lured to his final doom. Nobility battling it out with savage and basic instincts, urges, imperatives. Nobility wins;nobility instantiated in one's preparedness to protect that which one holds dear, for whatever reason, to any degree necessary. It's a fundamental animal urge; yet it is the one that allows even an animal to achieve nobility, dignity and purpose. The indictment of the human roaches-be they the, extremely un-PC, savages on Skull Island or the hyper-refined crowds going to see the 8th Wonder of the World-is all the more searing, because they appear to have no sense of it; and neither do they have even the tiniest shred of empathy for anything outside their own horizon.<br /><br />Ann's sentiments for the ape are more like 'compassion' than 'love'; understanding of the divided nature of that giant creature, on the human side of sentience in many ways, yet constrained to be something else because of what he is. Is there a better metaphor for humanity itself, and the eternal conflict between what we are and _need_ to be in order to survive and be 'human'; and yet there is that other thing that makes us want to be something 'other'-which we cannot be, individually or socially, because we would cease to be human. In the same vein KK is what he is, and he can only do what he does because he is that way. The paradox of our own existence.<br /><br />Jack is KK's human mirror-image, driven by the same instincts, but here they are constrained by his civilized upbringing. He is not a fighting machine, but a playwright-yet everything he does, shortly after meeting Ann, is essentially driven by the same motives as KK's: to protect her. He doesn't understand this at first; civilization and its essentially trivial accoutrements prevent him from seeing that which truly matters to him. But in the end, after the ape has fallen to his death, he's at the top of the Empire State Building with her.<br /><br />So, you see, the story isn't as simple as some would have it. Some humans come off very badly-especially those who have lost sight of the things that matter, and who become immersed in trivial self-importance and the gazillion meaningless pursuits offered by society to those who need them. But not all have lost perspective and others find it. The ape overall exhibits more nobility than most humans though. This is not so much anthropomorphization of the ape, but an indictment of the insectization of humans.<br /><br />KK is not just a good movie, but a great one; done with obvious affection for the genre and the story-with more depth and dimensions than either of its predecessors; more than I had expected or even dared hope for.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNAo protect that which one holds dear, for whatever reason, to any degree necessary.

0930289528|5.0|[...]  Frightening and powerful   In the early 1980's, Alan Moore (Watchmen, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, From Hell, chances are if you're reading this you know the list) began this chilling work. In an alternate world, it's 1997, and America and the Soviets have nuked each other to extinction. England is left, now under a fascist regime, and everything seems to be under control, until a mysterious terrorist, wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and calling himself V, begins picking off government officials and destroying buildings and monuments. Moore's storytelling is nothing short of chilling; from the basic element of the loss of freedom to a totalitarian government to just who really fights for good (is it V or the government?), V For Vendetta is nearly unforgettable. That combined with David Lloyd's ultra eerie washed out color art make this one of the most chilling works in the world of comics you'll ever likely find. It's not as profound or as important as Moore's Watchmen or his Swamp Thing run, but this is still worth reading.

He simply solved a different problem.  Contrary to taking the heart of the game, he opens your eyes to new levels of enlightenment.  (As Spirng training starts, I am looking at the players through a totally different lens).    <br /> <br />The writing is solid, the approach, uncluttered.  A simply great read - before you go to Opening Day
076113719X|4.0|I am still getting used to the format.  Not sure I like that the days go down in a row.  Surprised that this was not mentioned in any other review.   It's just not as easy to find the days of the week and look ahead a week or two.  I like that there is room to write and that each member of the family has their own space.  I will not purchase this particular calendar again, because I know of another that I personally like better - it has pockets - I love the pockets!  But, it is a beautiful calendar and who knows, by December I may like the format even better and may change my mind all together.  I have had it for 2 months and it is growing on me.
0316172324|4.0|I came to Blink after being so caught up by the Tipping Point that I expected the same level of greatness.   <br /> <br />This is a good book, and its central theme is intriguing.  I think he raises great points for readers to use the knowledge in bits and pieces - thin slices - if you'll indulge me with the terminology.  I find myself better able to understand what drives decisions.  And even better, how to improve them.  However, this took effort, and time away from the book to see the concepts in actions. <br /> <br />The first part of the book is better than the latter parts.  And i believe the parts focused on human beings under stress particularly intriguing.   <br /> <br />I also think the ability to focus, with laser sharpness on what we know, and begin to remove the artificialities is a concept I wish Mr. Gladwell would have explored more deeply - especially at the end - sort of a mechanism for putting this into practice more deeply (of course then someone might wrongly place it in the self help category).  <br /> <br />However, Blink is a fascinating study in understanding why you think you know what you - and fast you know it.

1580084621|5.0|This book was recommended by a few of my Thai friends as being the best book on Thai Cooking. I have aleady tried a number of recipes and found them to be great in both the explanation of how to cook the dish as well as in the final tasting. <br /> <br />
B000EGFVQS|2.0|This is a very disappointing book. The disappointment, for me, came from the fact that the subject so important and touching, as the bestial murder of a child and grief of the family, should be presented in equally moving manner. Even if the narrator is the child victim, which, obviously, necessitates some simplifications of the prose. Instead, Sebold's novel is formally conventional, very boring and predictable. I can understand its being a recommended reading for schoolchildren, because it can be a warning and fulfills the educational purposes, maybe getting to the adolescent child better than pamphlets and science, but if you are not a teenager and/or are looking for something else that a warning in a book, this would be a waste of time.
0618164413|5.0|Excellent. Curious George reflects little boys everywhere. He is curious, adventurous and completely loveable. An additional treat tagged onto the end of this book is the fascinating insight into the life of H.A. Rey and his bride.
1573229725|5.0|Definitely, I don't like the segregation of books into artificial \\"sub-genres\\". \\"Gay and lesbian fiction\\"? I don't get it, frankly. This book is about love and two women are in love here (and this is probably the most innocent thing happening), but if they were two men or a woman and a man, would it change anything? Obviously, the plot needs two girls for reasons other than the love story, and here we get to what this novel is about. This is a historical suspense thriller, very well researched, with excellent background and care of every smallest detail. The petty pick-pocket, Susan, is tricked by the \\"family friend\\" called Gentleman, into a plot aiming to get the money of the rich bibliophile. This is also a novel about books, the love of them, the emotions books can evoke in people (a special kind of books, maybe, but books anyway). The landscape and atmosphere of Victorian England, both the countryside and London, are painted with truly artistic strokes, gloomy and grey. The twists in the plot are really unexpected (beware!) and the tension is sometimes almost unbearable, so much, that it is difficult not to get to the end and get some relief as soon as possible, reading well into the night. The psychological portraits not only of the main characters, but also of the supporting ones, are superb. The lifestyles of various social classes are vividly depicted. Sarah Waters reached very high with this novel, gradually developing her style, and I must say - it will be difficult to match it with the next one.
B000002AEN|5.0|This is simply the smoothest blues i've ever heard. His incredibly fluid and smooth playing style is like a steady flow of water. Im also amazed at how one man could create such a sound with a guitar and sing at the same time. This music is also incredibly happy sounding for blues, the lyrics are rather sad, but the pretty way he sings them makes it very sweet sounding. This music reminds me less of the old delta blues (even though thats what it is) but sounds more like music from the hills, almost as if there is a folky feel to it. This is definately a great addition to anybodies blues collection, and i thoroughly suggest anybody who is interested in the blues to check this out.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|This movie is the stuff of nightmares. I saw it 2 times and I have been having bad dreams ever since. It's a very effective film and it's refreshing to see one of this calibre in the horror genre.  This film is very freaky but at the same time, beautiful. It's got an amazing ending and I hear there will be an alternative ending on the DVD.  The main thing that got me in this movie is how I came to care about the characters. This is rare as most of times you want to see those people die, this movie has great actors. It was both written and directed by Eli and I cannot wait to see what his next film will be. Eli Roth is the new king of horror!!
B000301YY8|1.0|As soon as I heard the first screeching notes, I called my buddies up for an impromptu poker night where we could spend some time drinking and farting instead of listening to this musical equivalent of a chick flick.

B000E97Y6K|1.0|I love the other films Peter Jackson has made. The best is Heavenly Creatures, if you have not seen this movie your missing out! I thought this movie was overly dramatic and to long. Had many unbeliveable moments and was so far fetched! The only cool thing about it was the natives, they were freaky.
B000BB1MHS|5.0|I wasn't particularly happy to hear that Tim Burton was doing a movie of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory because Gene Wilder epitomized Willy Wonka for me. I was wrong to doubt the genius of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The movie is a visual delight, with its stark contrast between the poverty of Charlie's home and the lushness of the factory. The Oompa Loompas' hilarious dances mask the sinister underlining of their songs. The movie is very true to Dahl's book, with the obnoxious children and their equally obnoxious parents being well acted. <br /> <br />But this is very definitely Johnny Depp's movie and his portrayal of Willy Wonka is delightful. Forget the comparisons to Michael Jackson; he contiuously reminded me of Carol Channing with his dimples, the slight tilt of his head and the crisp manner of speech- with a slight lisp. Funny? Oh yes! Disturbing? Slightly. Incredible? Absolutely! <br /> <br />In a different universe in a different movie, Gene Wilder is and always will be Willy Wonka. But in this movie and this movie's universe, Johnny Depp is most definitely Willy Wonka. This movie in no way detracts from the Gene Wilder movie; but stands alone on its own merits-- and does so quite well.

B0006L16N8|4.0|The \\"symbol\\" on the album cover is actally the album title in code.  The code is in the middle of the liner notes booklet.  There is another coded message on the last page; it says \\"Make Trade Fair\\".  Very clever of the band! <br /> <br />As for the album itself - I own all three Coldplay albums, and here's how I rank them: <br /> <br />A Rush of Blood to the Head <br />X&Y <br />Parachutes <br /> <br /> <br />I do listen to X&Y all the way through sometimes, but other times I don't.  There is a slight similarity between \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\", but IMO, the latter IS NOT part 2 of the former!
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I made the mistake of reading the early reviews on this board yesterday (March 7th, US release date) before I even purchased or sampled the CD.   Needless to say, I pushed the play button expecting to hear David Gilmour well past his prime.  Expecting to fall asleep while listening to it.  Expecting to be disappointed.  Let me tell you - I'm currently listening to the CD for my fourth consecutive time through, and it's a very alluring experience.   I agree with most who say that David's voice is still beautiful and well tuned.  The lyrics aren't the strongest I've heard, but you must remember that Roger was the real lyrical genius behind Pink Floyd, not David.  Besides, for me, music is first about the sound, then the lyrics.  I would certainly not call the CD boring - mello and smooth, yes!  But I think that's what makes it great!  At the risk of making another Floyd comparison (I've read \\"Shine On\\" in a post or two), the Floyd album that really came to mind when first listening was \\"Obscured by Clouds\\".  Not saying that it mimics OBC (think \\"Burning Bridges\\" or \\"Stay\\"), it just popped in my head.  I think my only disappointment so far is that I expected to hear more ripping guitar solos, and less accoustic.  But then again, I suits the overall feel of the album.  I guess the only I can say is - let this CD grow on you.  Don't let it collect dust.

B000E1155E|4.0|If this album has anything going for it is promise. Regardless of what the guy named Adam might say (if you look at his other review for a book, he just seems like a bitter guy who thinks he can do better, or he's a band member in some group who has a similar sound and thought they were ripped off, or maybe he just hates British groups 'casue they are better than most American groups hands down), this album doesn't have the greatest lyrics, but it does have promise. Promise that with just a little more time and experience (both personal and professional), they will get better in trying to metaphor and express their angst or oberservations. The music, I thought was solid, it reminded me of those Seattle days, when the guitars would just rip off and go, once again, not the greatest, but promise.  <br />I would say if you like Oasis for their cocky lyrics, then this is your boat. If you like The Vines, Razorlight, and any group that has a guitar driven sound mixed with that early Seattle inspired sound (I am not talking Soundgarden or AIC) then this is your boat too.  <br />It all comes down to promise, and this is what I was left with.

B00004XPPK|5.0|In real life, Rita Hayworth was apparently \\"painfully shy\\".  If so, she deserves the title, \\"Goddess of Acting\\" to go with her \\"Goddess of Love\\" nickname.  Her performance as Gilda is lots of things, none of which is shy.  She's off-scale beautiful/wild and shows, once again, why she was Fred Astaire's favorite dance partner (sorry, Ginger). <br /> <br />Glen Ford, as Johnny, plays a complex bundle of inconsistencies in regards to Gilda and makes it believable.  There's an underlying theme of self-destruction by the principles in this \\"film noir\\" (black film), but it has a good twist at the end.
0966638328|5.0|Great Book - esp. for a designer - breaks down the psychology of colour/visual response and appeal - esp. when it comes to color and setting a certain tone and mood - this book is definitely helpful.

B00005MP58|5.0|This A&E production is infinitely superior to the recent movie version. The casting was superior, and the script followed the book to a greater degree than the later version.Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle were excellent as Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, and even the minor characters were outstanding. <br /> <br />The DVD replaces a VCR version of the production, and if technology results in another form of the performance, I would probably buy that also. I cannot say that about the recent Hollywood production, since I do not intend to buy even the DVD.
1577311523|5.0|As a seeker but also a skeptic, the world's religions were too enigmatic for me to understand.  Eckhart Tolle ties together the essence of spiritualism and the practicality of science that makes sense of life and our universe.  He feeds both sides of the brain.
B00005UW7G|2.0|I truly wanted to enjoy this Don Giovanni.  Unfortunately, not enough advantage is taken of the film medium (for example, the entire \\"Mille torbidi pensieri\\" section of \\"Sola, sola in buio loco\\" is done in a single shot, with all the actors standing in a line, providing no advantage over a staged production).  The sound, as it has been said before, is quite terrible, but what I simply cannot force myself to overlook is the character interpretation.    Raimondi is a decent enough Don Giovanni, being sinister, shameless, and coldly proper.  Unfortunately, Don Giovanni is not the only character in the opera.  If he were, this would be a pretty good movie.  Much of our view of Don Giovanni's character has to do with his servant.  Typically, Leporello is unwisely played as a complete doofus.  In this case, Leporello is the opposite, if just as bad--almost completely devoid of personality, which is nothing short of a wonder, considering both the music and the text given to the character.  I never knew that \\"Ah, pieta, signori miei\\" could be sung almost completely lifelessly.  He looks somewhat unconcerned when his life is threatened in \\"Sola, sola in buio loco,\\" and, far from being afraid of his master, seems quite indignant when Don Giovanni tries to blame him for the attack on Zerlina.  The amount of propriety he displays would work for a more typical servant role, but Leporello is not a typical servant role, being both our access to the story and our contact with reality, and most of the comedy in the opera, to boot.  I was severely disappointed in this case.  I wanted the wit and sarcasm of Leporello to have more than a cameo appearance.  I wanted him to have a little humor to him, maybe even the capacity for a smile.  I wanted him to actually make sense.    Kiri Te Kanawa is a wonderful singer, but she seems to have a similar problem to Jose van Dam's in her Donna Elvira.  She is angry, but there isn't exactly a personality to go with her anger.  She reacts to the situations and the text, but without any great thought to why her character reacts this way.  I found it very odd, actually, that she's singing \\"God protect my trusting heart\\" with a joyous smile.  Her \\"Mi tradi\\" is slow, frustratingly lyrical, and altogether unsatisfying, but that is truly the fault of the conductor.    The filming of Masetto's \\"Ho capito, signor si\\" is a little silly.  He is standing outside the house into which Don Giovanni and Zerlina have disappeared as he sings to them, which works until he sings, \\"Vengo, vengo\\" (\\"I'm coming, I'm coming\\").  This line is meant to be sung to Leporello, who is urging him to come away to Don Giovanni's palace.  When Masetto sings this to the air, it doesn't make sense.  Unfortunately, this sort of disregard for the text occurs throughout the opera.  For example, Leporello imitates the footsteps of the statue without having actually heard them--he only sees a brief, ghostly visage of the statue, which quickly fades in and out, but never walks at all.    The rest of the cast is made up of gorgeous voices.  I could have closed my eyes and been quite happy, but watching them is quite boring.  The only one that shows a real glimmer is Zerlina (thank God for Teresa Bergonza), who very much seems to enjoy tormenting Masetto during \\"Batti, batti.\\"    I did like the way the Catalogue Aria was filmed, if not the way it was sung.  It is visually interesting for various servants to pull out enormous volumes and spread their single lengthy page far, far across what appears to be Don Giovanni's front lawn, down into the nearby village.  It's over-the-top, but appropriately so.  I also like that Donna Anna is not the first to see her father dead--that the Commendatore is killed in the middle of a street, and people are gathering and some servants are even lifting the body onto a stretcher when Donna Anna and Don Ottavio see the scene.  I was quite happy that Don Giovanni and Leporello are literally shouting in each others' faces at the end of \\"Eh via, buffone,\\" even if Leporello appears more stuck-up than angry.    One scene which made me excited for a brief moment was the Act I finale, just as we are entering the \\"Tremor, tremor, scellerato!\\" section.  Don Giovanni seizes Leporello and pushes him through the crowd, and the Anti-Giovanni Wheel follows them.  \\"Ah!  Camera movement!\\" I thought excitedly.  \\"They're taking advantage of the action in the music!\\"  It was short-lived.  The Don and his servant quickly reach a point where they stop and keep singing while everyone else stands some distance away.  This is what I mean when I say this movie does not take advantage of the film medium.    There are definitely better Don Giovannis on DVD, including even the all-right von Karajan production with Samuel Ramey.  Far superior is the Met production of 2000 with Bryn Terfel, Renee Fleming, and Ferruccio Furlanetto, which I have reviewed on Amazon.  While no specific production will please everybody, some come closer than others, and regrettably, this one does not even come close for me.
B000002KIE|5.0|Excellent, brooding (and NOT magnificent, lol) and also HIGHLY amusing. It's OK if you just don't get it; simply go and shop elsewhere.   <br /> <br />Wonder if John ever checks out this bollocks ?
B00004WLXZ|5.0|An assault for certain, and all the more nefarious due to its artistic merit. Before going any further, to address this edition specifically, I have to say that it greatly enhances the film. It has an optional professor's narrative which can be enabled to play along as one watches. I know a considerable amount about the era, but found that I learned much from listening in to his lecture.<br /><br />There are two important justifications for valuing Triumph of the Will. First, even though it is contrived and propagandistic, we are privy to a primary source document from the period-which, historically speaking, is an end in itself. The Nazis were human beings, all-be-they particularly evil ones; men (for the most part) as opposed to Goblins or Orcs. We see this clearly with Himmler who appears to be the only one in SS uniform that cannot goosestep, and also in the awkward interaction between Herr Reichsfeuhrer and his master upon the podium. They don't know whether to shake hands or continue to jut their arms out erectly. Triumph... reveals, perhaps unintentionally, much that cannot be described by narrative or second hand account.<br /><br />A second reason to see and preserve this documentary is that it makes us more grateful for the democracies in which we live. Through these planned shots and compulsively rehearsed movements, we can feel what it must have been like to have had the misfortune to live within the pincer prongs of a totalitarian state. When confronted by this picturesque masterpiece, we feel a sympathy for the Germans that was not possible 60 years ago. For them, there was no CNN or BBC or Fox News; there was only Dr. Goebbels, and the projects and information he approved or fabricated. No way of hearing the truth was possible, unless they risked their lives to come across it.<br /><br />Life under the Nazis was as communitarian as could be, and that, as an American, is what I found most repellent. Being submerged within a uniformed mass of citizens is something our Founders would have never tolerated-and thank God for that! A life of conformity and ritual is not a life at all. Having to line up like the workers and youth here to listen to blowhards bellow was certainly an underrated barbarism of that time. Only the Nazis could have turned Nuremberg Party Day into a week's worth of activities. This is a living dedication to narcissistic leadership and the victory of self-adulation over reason. This society was so militarized that even the men of the National Labor Service wielded their spades as if they were rifles. Hitler appears often before us, and is presented in his best light. Yet, one can sense his detachment, and note his manners which are more studied than real. He peers out from hotels and airplanes with a benevolent expression while never remotely caring about the people he is supposed to guarding. Yes, this movie is very slanted, but all the horror you need to see remains visible.tizens is something our Founders would have never tolerated-and thank God for that!

B000002KOO|5.0|If you like blues, blues-rock, English blues, or just good music from a past era, give this a listen.  If you didn't know, Peter Green was the founder of Fleetwood Mac way back in the 60's.  Founded as a British blues group, Peter Green is a most excellent guitarist with a touch and sound all his own.  This is HIS group and this was an American release that was original and fresh sounding as it is today.  From blues guitar to electric to slide to Spanish this album (CD) has it all.  If you're not familiar with Peter Green, give this a listen with and let this CD be a segue to the other original Fleetwood Mac CD's available.
B00005JOFO|4.0|\\"I'm a gay man. I hated Brokeback Mountain. So did my boyfriend. And I'm very glad Crash beat it for Best Picture. So is he.\\" <br /> <br />I think what this poster failed to notice is that BB does not take place in the year 2006.  Even today, a great number of homosexual persons marry someone of the opposite sex.  It's a desperate attempt to appear normal, and it happened exponentially more decades ago. <br /> <br />Since he felt the need to point it out, I'll note that I'm also a homosexual (and I'm the product of a 'BB' relationship between a gay male and a heterosexual female).   <br /> <br />Perhaps it is wrong . . . but it's a direct product of our society's condemnation of homosexual relationships-condemnation that much worse in the 1960's than it is today (though of course it still exists). <br /> <br />I found 'Crash' to be heavy-handed, manipulative, and incredibly unrealistic.  I can't believe it was even nominated.

0440238609|5.0|My children are now in their 20s.  But do I wish that I had had these 3 books when they were in middle school and in high school.  Books have always been all over the place in our home, school books and classics and literature, and less classic and others, from Doonesbury, Fox Trot etc.. to Bertrand Russell, Douglas Adams, The Bible in 3 versions, the Koran, Asimov, Homer, Pratchett, Denis Guedj, writers from all over the world, well it would take me the  whole day. The point is, one book was missing: \\"His dark Material\\". Mea culpa. The book is so well written that my husband procrastinated over correcting his undergrad students papers to finish reading the Volume 1.  And we both agreed that our reading of \\"His dark Material\\"  enlightened our understanding of Milton's Paradise Lost.   But much more important, what Philip Pullman is doing is opening a window for fresh air, to freeing the thinking of younger readers upon the grand question of the existence or non-existence of God, the definitions of Hell, Heaven, goodness; and of the not less important questions related to the appropriateness of churches and religions; and by extension of  what it means to be a plain good human being. And most amazing is that he accomplished this marvel in a particularly intelligent, sensitive, delicate, and respectful way to all readers. Thank you, Philip Pullman! We need more writers like you.
B000BTJCRM|5.0|<br />This Australian band's first album has all the hallmarks of a 1970s classic rock album. That is not a criticism but a compliment. What is more, if this album had been issued in the 1970s then it would in all probability been a great success, because it's that good. It's got guitar, organ, good vocals and is best heard loud. The songs are well crafted and there are echoes of a number of bands like Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep, Deep Purple, Budgie etc. This Aussie trio rock! Wolfmother are a real find and they deserve a good measure of success with this excellent album. Standout tracks (there are so many!): 'Colossal', 'The White Unicorn', and 'Mind's Eye'. But there is something here for every rock fan - enjoy!
B000002L9J|5.0|Definitely a gem in the Smiths anthology, The Queen is Dead is the album that launched the Smiths to international acclaim in contrast to the relegated cult following they enjoyed in Europe. As many fans of the Smiths, when I first became acquainted with the Smiths, I discovered a band that represented much more than an image or sound. As an alienated youth, Morrissey's whitty and heartfelt lyrics where ones that I readily clung to. Through the music of the Smith's I was able to conjure an image of what it was lke to be British. Perhaps to some residents of the U.K, gestures of national pride and cultural identity might appear to be vulgar or even jingoistic, but if there's anything lacking from music today, it would be the sense of urgeny and passion that a band like The Smiths conveyed to the world. Long live great music and Long live The Smiths.

B00005B4GU|5.0|Brave, Adventurous, Avant Garde; Yes, all these metaphors used to describe this album are true and then some. The first time I heard this album, me and a good friend of mine had just heavily gotten into Radiohead. Some may say that Amnesiac is complementary to Kid A, or maybe even downgrade it as a collection of sub-par B sides. The truth is that Amnesiac is the diamond in the rough. Anyone who takes the time to examine this album conceptually will discover what a treasure it is. Some of the tracks such as \\"Packt Like Sardines\\" and Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors may take the listener aback; however, one should not be quick to place judgement on this album based on two overly produced tracks. Radiohead is one of the few bands that can't be judged on musical merit alone. The key to understanding Radiohead is the underlying themes behind the music and the measures this band takes to transmit its ideas through to the mass consciousness. Governement and individuals who are in positions of affluence communicate their ideas, but Radiohead transcends its ideas through the ancient medium of music. To truly appreciate this album, examine the eloquent artwork and the different meanings conveyed therein.
B000002KIE|1.0|Seriously.  I was bored through most of this album.  There were only two songs on here that I liked, and those were 'Holidays in the Sun' and 'Seventeen', and they themselves get annoying after a while.  The song's lyrics are moronic, and I'd rather listen to a Dead Kennedys or Crass album any day.  Those two bands were truly great.  This...is just garbage.
B000301YY8|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums I have ever heard. It has a very rare quality about it. In a world where hardcore metal bands seem to rule the charts, it's refreshing to see an artist like James Blunt making his stand in there. \\"Back To Bedlam\\" is as honest as records get, blunt doesn't believe in sugar coating anything and yet his songs are still very radio-friendly, take for instance the smash single \\"Your Beautiful\\" a song that is just about as from the heart as music gets. One thing that is really annoying to me is that every place that sells this cd always lists it as \\"Explicit Lyrics\\" which is very far from the truth, It has only two curse words in the entire album. There is no Parental Advisory sticker on it, all it has is a thing on the back that says, This album contains lyrics of an adult nature. This album is just straight forward, beautiful pop rock from a very talented up and coming artist. One listen will hook you in, trust me, I'm living proof. The best songs are \\"Tears And Rain\\", \\"Your Beautiful\\" and \\"Wisemen\\". Just an example of how deep blunt's lyrics are, here is a sample from \\"Tears And Rain\\". <br /> <br /> \\"I guess it's time to run far, far away. <br />  Find comfort in pain. <br />  All pleasure's the same. <br />  It just keeps me from trouble. <br />  Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray. <br />  I've heard what they say, but i'm not here for trouble. <br />  It's more than just words. <br />  It's just tears and rain.\\" <br /> <br />If you like Pop/Rock that has something to say, and artists that actually write their own music. You should definately like Back To Bedlam. It is as honest and from the heart as music gets. I just can't wait for his next record.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|This is a great movie, I'd recommend it to anyone who can read subtitles.
B00005JMXX|4.0|If you are looking for a movie with great special effects you will like it.  In general, the end was predictable and need a more realistic end.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Once again David Gilmour prooved himself as a true artist with or without Pink Floyd, he shines! <br /> <br />On An Island and The Blue are probably the best tracks on this album. <br /> <br />Castellorizon: Fine piece of work here reminds you of 'Lets Get Metaphysical' from About Face 1984 solo. <br /> <br />On An Island: Gives a touch of Pink Floyd and quite similar to his previous solo album sounds featuring typical great Gilmourish guitar solo in the end. The best track on album. <br /> <br />The Blue: Another great track, beautiful and relaxing song with a lovely guitar solo. <br /> <br />Red Sky At Night: Background music resembles to The Division Bell sounds, David should have used guitar here instead of saxophone but not bad. <br /> <br />Take a Breath & This Heaven: Assures David still rocks. <br /> <br />Then I Close My Eyes: Amazing, terrific instrumental! David on guitars & Robert Wyatt on cornett. A delightful gift for fans! <br /> <br />Smile & Pocketful of Stone: Wonderful songs indeed! <br /> <br />Where We Start: Good end of the show, as Near The End was best ending to 1984's About Face and High Hopes to The Division Bell. <br /> <br />On An Island is celestial & heavenly album. Highly recommended for About Face & The Division Bell admirers and all Floydians ofcourse.
0679422714|5.0|This work exposes the Leninist dictator Mao for what he was - a murderous despot.  Mao's manipulations and murders on his road to power remind the reader of William Shakespeare's Richard III.  Only Mao was Richard III writ large - achieving and holding on to power a lot more successfully and killing millions of people in the process.  The ten years spent in researching the material for this book were very well spent.<br /><br />Viewers who object to the presumed lack of objectivity in this book would have better credibility if they also attacked William Shirer and other biographers of Adolf Hitler.  Sometimes historians are allowed to make moral judgements.<br /><br />The importance of this book increases since Maoism is the most vibrant form of Leninism today.  The book will make Mao worship and Lenin worship more difficult.  And this is very good.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|This is one great movie. Jon Stewart, on the Oscars, called it \\"Ray\\" with white people, but it's far far better, and more, than that...Joaquin Phoenix just burns in this role - he completely captures the feisty and angry spirit of the early Man in Black. His dedication to the role is absolute. I'm not sure why Reese Witherspoon deserved an Oscar over the other contenders for her portrayal of June Carter, but still, she is more than serviceable. <br /> <br />Extremely moving, inspiring and brimming over with life. HIGHly recommended.
B000301YY8|1.0|If you don't know who James Blunt is (until recently, I sure hadn't a clue) I wouldn't buy his music until I read ALL of the Amazon reviews here.<br /><br />I happened to be channel-surfing and ran across James performing on the \\"Oprah\\" show.  I can honestly say I've never  seen or heard someone quite so horrendously terrible, even on \\"American Idol\\" tryouts.  He stared directly into the camera, barely holding in bucketfuls of tears, overemoting like Norma Desmond on crack cocaine.  Oprah acted dumfounded, but I couldn't tell if she was impressed, or going into a diabetic seizure.  \\"Where,\\" she asked him, \\"did that phrase come from?\\"  This after the coda to \\"Goodbye, My Lover\\" in which Blunt repeatedly sings \\"I'm hollow...I'm hollow...so H-O-L-L-O-W-W-W\\".<br /><br />I immediately ran to the computer to see what other composition samples I could find, if only for a laugh.  Oy, the lyrics!  The pathos!!  The whining!!!  Like a little girl throwing a hissy fit in a candy store.  Somebody slap this guy...hard!<br /><br />There are two versions of \\"Back to Bedlam\\", one of which has an \\"explicit lyric\\" warning.  Now I am a sensitive gay guy, but the thought of what X-rated wimpiness those renditions may contain makes me shudder.  And I think that about sums it all up.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|First of all I should mention that this was the first pj studio album I had ever purchased(my first pj purchase was live in japan '03). So maybe I am a bit biased towords the greatness of this collection of b-sides and fan favorites. You have to wonder how most of these songs did not make the album they were intended for. It's hard to imagine that these song's even ended up as b-sides as most of them are every bit as good as the song's that did make the album cut. But enough about that, I would rate this release as the best pearl jam album available ( i do own all of them and they are all excellent). This release shouldn't be looked at like \\"Rearviewmirror; The Best Of Pearl Jam\\", but instead as another studio album.  <br /> <br />The highlights of this release are endless but some of the best song's in my opinion are \\"Down\\", a song that didn't make it on the riot act album but is arguably as good or better than any song on that album.  <br /> <br />Hitchhiker and Dont' Gimme No Lip are both fast punk tinged songs.   <br /> <br />black and red and yellow, another punkish one that's done really well. <br /> <br />Leaving Here, a song the who also used to cover..not half bad job done here. <br /> <br /> <br />Yellowledbetter...considered by most to be one of, if not the best pearl jam song's. I would have to agree..nearly perfect in every aspect. <br /> <br />The second disc is nearly flawless. Slower paced than the first one but still engrossing.  Highlights are: <br /> <br />Fatal..powerful lyrics and interesting music <br /> <br />Footsteps...most pearl jam fans know this one well. Such a powerful song. <br /> <br />Let Me Sleep...interesting music and good christmas time lyrics. <br /> <br />Driftin'...one of my favorite songs off this release for sure. Just love the music and singing along. <br /> <br />Last Kiss..thankfully I didn't hear this song on the radio as many times as the people that hate this cover song because I still love it. Not exactly a song you would have expected PJ to cover at the time which makes it all the better. <br /> <br />Brother, an instrumental rock song..really good. <br /> <br />Bee Girl, I love this song. enough said. <br /> <br />Buy this album for some of the best pj music available. Don't wait to buy this if you are new to pearl jam and if you're not then you should already own it. <br />
038572179X|1.0|I have one word for this book...BORING!!...A dictionary is more exciting than this tripe..A weak plot, if that`s what you can call it,,descriptions of various items that border on tedious,,how much description does a bedpan need anyway??? Save your time--go buy  Webster`s .........
B00005MNP8|5.0|I own the original release on vinyl and is my favorite Blondie record.I recommend this to anyone new to Blondie.
0393317552|2.0|Well written and well researched books can still be seriously flawed, of course, and I believe this is one example.  Mr. Diamond tips his hand fairly early in the book by taking pains to explain that there is no scientific evidence of genetic variations in intelligence and that this idea came about through Eurocentrism.  He then states that his aboriginal friends of New Guinea are obviously more intelligent than white Europeans and wonders how the two cultures developed so differently. This contradiction and Mr. Diamond's pretty obvious biases made it very difficult for me to take his answers to this very interesting question seriously.

B000BISBDY|5.0|This is by far the best compilation of Cash's works. Probably the most bang for the buck too. Its covers the basics and best works of  his career. I mean, obviously for Cash there is no such thing as filler tracks, but this album only includes the highest caliber of songs by Cash. Best investment i ever made =)
B000063V8T|5.0|This season has again many episodes with the best performance and development of ideas in all the star trek TNG series. The introduction of new charaters become more interesting the series because its possible to develop more new relationships and explore the human reactions against difficult situations as time distorted or even death. One piece is missing, there is no episodes of the Q, who always introduce a diference. Besides that, this season is joyful, i'm sure you will enjoy it. <br /> <br />Esta temporada tiene nuevamente muchos episodios con las mejores actuaciones y desarrollo de ideas de la serie y es posible el desarrollo de mas nuevas relaciones y la exploracin de las reacciones humanas antesituaciones dificiles  como distorsiones en el tiempo o incluso la muerte.

B0000DJZB9|5.0|This DVD contains pretty much all the best of GNR's.  What really surprised me is the quality of the sound.  It sounds terrific and it's not hard to tell it's well remastered.  Compared to the CDs, the high frequency levels are louder and makes the music a lot more crispier.  Get it if you love GNR videos.
B00005OWIU|1.0|It's quite funny to see people rave about the beautiful \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" melody. <br /> <br />Yes, it was beautiful when Tchaikovsky composed it 150 years ago as the Andante from his ballet \\"Swan Lake.\\" <br /> <br />Williams shamelessly copied the melody for his \\"Hedwig's Theme\\".  I'm a little astonished that the producers let this plagiarism slip by, but perhaps they're still waiting for spine donors. <br /> <br />Williams also steals other music from himself as well as classical composers for this score.  It's a shame that once he hit his sixties he can't be original anymore. <br /> <br />Or maybe it's Alzheimer's disease and he just can't remember that someone else wrote it first...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Well first I went online like alot of people do to listen to samples, before I run out and buy the album. So to those who are complaining that you \\"bought the album, and didn't like it,\\" maybe next time you should go on line to listen to what they call 29 second samples. Anyway, I like the c.d. very much. It's deffinitely good dancing music. I like how after each song ends, it keeps playing the music to the next song. I think this is one of Madonna's best c.d.'s to date. Of course I like some of her other stuff she's done in the past. But this c.d. beats out all the other new music that's coming out by other stars like Jessica Simpson, and Britney Spears, etc. Overall, if you like techno, with a little bit of a disco sound to it, then you will like this album. I bought this for my older sister who grew up listening to Madonna, and she loved it.
B00003CXAW|5.0|I thought I'd write my review of this movie by comparing the classic 1933 version to the new Peter Jackson 2005 version. <br /> <br />First off, if you haven't seen both KONGS, you will find spoilers in my write-up that follows. In that case, you may just want to skip reading this. <br /> <br />Otherwise, here are my thoughts: <br /> <br />New York City of the '30s: Both movies handled it great. The original, obviously, because it WAS the 1930's when the movie was made. But the 2005 version did a great job covering the look and feel of that era in the Big Apple. ADVANTAGE: TIE <br /> <br />Jack Black vs Robert Armstrong as Carl Denim: Watching Black was about like watching someone scrape their fingernails on a blackboard. The guy can't act. Period. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG <br /> <br />The natives of Skull Island: I have to admit, the natives in the 2005 version were much scarier. But before I give the nod to the 2005 Kong version here, I have to go on to a few more \\"native\\" items, the first being the capture of Ann from the ship. In the original the natives quietly come up in small boats alongside the ship and kidnap her. In the 2005 version, the natives are Olympic Champions as they pole-vault all the way from the island to the ship and SOMEhow get her back to the island with them (pole-vaulting back?) CALL THE OLYMPICS! The second item I didn't like about the 2005 natives was that they just disappeared from the Island after the start of the movie. Where were they when Kong came pounding on the huge door? Because of these items, I say: ADVANTAGE 1933 KONG <br /> <br />Fay vs. Naomi and the way they covered their role as Ann Darrow. I have one question. Since when did this movie turn into a true LOVE story? Kong is a huge beast. Kong kills anyone and anything in his path that prevents him from getting what he wants (in this case, Ann). So what would the correct response be for someone in danger? To SCREAM! And that's exactly what Fay did in the 1933 original. While Naomi tumbled, juggled, and went ice skating with him instead. This brought back images from the terrible 1976 remake. And what's with Naomi being the ONLY person running around a snow covered New York City at the end of the movie, without wearing a coat of any kind? Not only that, but actually WANTING to climb to the very top of the Empire State Building crown to be closer to the giant ape. Can you imagine how cold and windy it would be at THAT altitude? Not to mention how icy/slippery the stairs would have been up there as well. Fay wanted to stay clear of Kong. Naomi (coatless) wants to hug his leg to protect him! ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG <br /> <br />The look of KONG: For what they had available in 1933, Kong looked pretty darn good. There was a lot of work put into his animation and the other creatures as well. But I WILL concede that he looked far more realistic in the 2005 version. ADVANTAGE: 2005 KONG <br /> <br />KONG vs the TYRO: The original had a great battle complete with wonderful sound effects as the Tyro whipped his tail about. Even knocking Kong into a tree that topples which was holding Ann. But the new version has MULTIPLE TYROS for KONG to fight. And what a fight it is. Very well done. Except for the fact that Kong held Ann in his hand for the entire fight and she would have suffered some of the nastiest whiplash this side of a head-on train collision! The new 2005 version even has KONG doing the infamous cracking of the TYRO's jaw scene. But there's one thing the original has that the 2005 version doesn't. AFTER the fight there is a scene where Driscoll has to jump in and out of the mouth of the TYRO in order to continue following KONG. In that scene you can see the blood streaming from the jaw of the TYRO. This scene isn't shown in the 2005 version. So, in this category I'd say: ADVANTAGE: TIE <br /> <br />Speaking of missing items from the 2005 version, how about the brontosaurus chomping on some of the crew members? How about Kong vs the Snake in the cave? And Kong chewing on some of the natives? And Kong STOMPING the natives into the mud? And Kong chomping on people in New York City when he escapes? And tossing the woman to her death that he pulls from an apartment high up in one building? And of course, what about the VERY famous subway train scene where Kong smashes the track and the conductor only sees Kong's head and the whites of his eyes coming up through the tracks ahead? Every one of these are scenes that helped make the original as famous as it is. So which is better? Including them? Or not? This is an easy one. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG <br /> <br />When Kong came crashing through the huge gate on Skull Island, the original had much more tension to the scene. The bolt across the door slowly bent and cracked. The crew AND the natives all piled on together in an effort to stop the rampaging gorilla! The 2005 version had Kong just quickly batter through the door. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG. <br /> <br />MUSIC - There's just no comparison here. The 1933 KONG has one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. The music worked WITH the action on the screen. The 2005 soundtrack is forgetable. ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG <br /> <br />THE INFAMOUS SPIDER/INSECT SCENE - Pulled from the original movie because it was thought to distract viewers from thinking about KONG, the 2005 version DID include it. Granted, the insects were hideous. It was a scary scene. But since when does someone that doesn't know how to shoot a gun shoot directly AT someone covered with insects and ONLY shoot the insects off of him without one shot hitting the crewman? Because of this stupidity it would have been better to HAVE eliminated this scene. And again: ADVANTAGE: 1933 KONG. <br /> <br />I could go on for a lot longer, but just counting up the ADVANTAGES that I've already shown above, you can see that I don't consider the 2005 KONG version to even come CLOSE to the original 1933 version. <br /> <br />In a way, I'm surprised though. Mainly because Peter Jackson said he loved the original. I thought he would pay better homage to it. Not so.
B00005BL2A|2.0|You started to see the decline in DM when Alan left after SOFAD. Ultra was ok at best, Exciter on the other hand is simply not worth listening to. There is not one song on this whole cd that is worth sitting down and listening to. If you believed that DM could prevail without Alan Wilder, listen to this CD and it will change your mind. This album lacks direction, and the fans are left thinking \\"Is this the end of DM?\\" <br />

B000B2YQX4|4.0|Ok, this is the best album for DM since SOFAD. The songs on this CD actually sound pleasant and the song Precious is an instant classic. However, since SOFAD, there have only been two songs that are instant classics \\"Its No Good\\" and \\"Precious\\". This album though does merit 4 stars on the strength of the other songs that, while they arent classics, start to sound better than the cd filler in Exciter and the too dark sound of Ultra. In short, DM is back on the upswing...lets hope Alan comes back.. <br />
B000E0OBK6|1.0|Ron C as a real Marine I will tell you, we spell our CORPS CORPS!!!!! Not Core! You twit. And second of all I would like to point out that NO Marine on Chesty's green earth would ever refer to themselves as a soldier. We are Marines, enough said. And just what batallion,company, you in there Ron C? Who's your CO? Where in Iraq are you? Learn to spell, and most importantly, never try to emulate something you don't understand, you never know who's reading...
B000000WZ4|3.0|When Alan Wilder left DM, that huge gaping hole could never be closed. As DM continued on as a trio, the songs on this album show that Alan's influence in the design of the beats was severly missed. The only worthy song on this whole CD was Its no Good. Everything else was not DM worthy...

B00069A5GY|5.0|A very tasteful album.  Each song has a nice story to tell and the musicianship on the album is second to none.  The surrownd sond is set up like you were sitiing in the middle of the band.  Mark Knopfler's guitar playing is adventurous and beautiful.  There are some good Rock songs (Boom Like That), blues (Song for Sonny Liston), and ballads.  All in all an excellent record and one that should be included in everyones library. Nice extras with a \\"making of the record\\" segment and 4 good videos. <br />I guarentee you will enjoy this record!

B00005JOWF|3.0|Hemo-prefix, blood<br /><br />Phage-suffix, something that eats or destroys.  E.g. bacteriophage.<br /><br />I can't help feel that 11 September has affected moviemaking in presenting commentary on the aftereffects of that tragedy.  In the case of Crash, it was ethnic relations.  Instead of the \\"war on terrorism,\\" there is a war against viruses and their carriers in Ultraviolet.  A mutated virus infects certain people who are called hemophages.  To maintain the health security of the people, special squads a scientific-oriented equivalent of Homeland Security under the leadership of the villainous Vice Cardinal Daxus, are sent to hunt down and exterminate the hemophages.  Daxus is a stereotypical smarmy cartoonish villain, who has a pair of plugs, or are those filters-through both nostrils.  And the presence of white plastic gloves and his unwrapping guns from sterilized packages make him the posterboy for bacteriophobia.  Interesting too is the shape of Daxus's headquarters, in a cross, like a cathedral, making germ-freedom into a kind of religion.<br /><br />Yet, a small resistance group has formed.  Among them is Violet, or V, a warrior with long jet black hair, glossy midriffed fetish suits of varying colours, a brace of machine guns that look more like staple guns, and a sword with some runes all over the blade.  They're very lethal, yet with the exception of some opponents on a rooftop, many of her opponents die without any blood.  And even without weapons, she is quite the martial artist a la Crouching Tiger.  V, herself once human, until the virus infecting her caused the death of her husband and unborn child-she was pregnant at the time-now hates humans, given how marginalized and persecuted hemophages are.<br /><br />Despite being called hemophages, the only thing remotely similar to vampires is the telltale fangs, which aren't for drinking Transylvanian tea.  Some characteristics of their mutations involve conjuring weapons from their bodies and a superior strength.<br /><br />Assigned by the leader of the hemophage underground leader, Nerva, to steal a secret weapon that if used, would kill all hemophages, and which, if not delivered on time, will self-destruct, V passes herself off as a courier.  When her cover's blown, she takes on several masked and heavily uniformed black and white-suited guards using her weapons.  Yet, when she discovers that the \\"weapon\\" is a child named Six, for a reason that becomes clear later in the film, some maternal instincts take over and she flees from Nerva and the rebels, Six in tow.  She has to avoid the hoards of Daxus's armed men, and fortunately gets help from Garth, a fellow hemophage and scientist.<br /><br />Despite the comic book style opening sequence, those into PS/2, XBOX style games, and not DC or Marvel Comics collectors, will probably be the biggest fans of this movie.  Watching the chase scene where V is pursued after leaving Daxus's headquarters, the peppered bulletholes, copters, shiny sides of skyscrapers all make Ultraviolet a video game on the big screen.  And there is a focus on aerial shots, where the however-many assailants surround V in a circle, only to be made digital mincemeat out of them, sometimes set to a pulsing techno score during the fighting or chase scenes, another dynamic of video games.  It's been mentioned along with Tron, itself an 80's movie that computerized its characters.  I'd also add the sci-fi/noir atmosphere of Bladerunner crossed with Minority Report as another comparing factor.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich's action films have a sci-fi bent to them-e.g. The Fifth Element and Resident Evil.  Here, she's a sci-fi guardian of a child, and it's not the acting but her glossy appearance and moves that are the heart of the movie.  So, despite the widespread panning by critics, what's my assessment?  If one concentrates more on its stylistic merits and Jovovich, rather than plot, then it's worth a look.  Those who automatically dismiss it as being another Matrix clone will probably not enjoy it.as being another Matrix clone will probably not enjoy it. <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|We all should stop analyzing why BB didnt win the Oscar. We all know why. Hollywood just thought racism was a more important subject to be addressed. Period. <br /> <br />Remember BB won most of all the major awards leading up to the Oscars. Just being nominated was an achievement in itself. <br /> <br />I personally didnt care for Crash. The subject of rascism is an important topic to address, Crash just didnt address it very well.  <br /> <br />Remember everyone, BB grossed more then any other Oscar best picture nominee. That tells you something. It touched the hearts of more people and will continue to do so throughout the years. Crash on the other hand will die and be forgotten. It will only be remembered for the upset of BB at the Oscars. <br /> <br />If you havent seen BB yet, I would highly recommend it. Go see Crash also..in fact go see all the Oscar nominated films. They are all significant in there own right. <br /> <br />Again, remember we still made progress with BB. The film will live on with generations to come.

B000EGDC0A|5.0|I've had the import version since last summer, and it's remained in very heavy rotation ever since. I dare say it's one of my all-time favorites. I absolutely love the first two albums, but with Supernature their sound has been perfected. Not only have they found their niche - they now rule it. Allison Goldfrapp has become the reigning queen of electronic pop. All others should kneel before her and weep with envy. Supernature is flawless. Every track is sheer aural magic. The majority of the album is ultra-swank disco-pop, but there are of course a couple of chill tracks akin to \\"Utopia,\\" \\"Pilots,\\" \\"Black Cherry,\\" \\"Hairy Trees,\\" and the like that will momentarily pull you out of the club and into that semi-familiar dreamworld of snow-capped mountains and fields of rainbow-colored blooms. <br /> <br />All that said... I don't think \\"Ooh La La\\" and \\"Number 1\\" were the best choices for the first singles. \\"Ooh La La\\" is the only track that seems a bit derivative of Black Cherry's hit singles, and \\"Number 1\\" is just not one of the best songs. Both are greats tracks - no doubt - but I would have chosen one of the more unique electro-disco-cabaret stormers like the suggestive \\"Slide In\\" or \\"Ride A White Horse,\\" the cool, catchy, mid-tempo pop gem \\"Fly Me Away,\\" or the gorgeous, Felt Mountain-esque \\"Time Out From The World.\\" These four tracks - along with \\"You Never Know\\" and \\"Let It Take You\\" - are my personal favorites, but there really isn't a skippable track.  <br /> <br />Perhaps there is something supernatural at work here... some type of witchcraft casting its spell over me... or maybe this is just a ridiculously talented duo that knows how to make damn fine music. In either case, do not miss this masterpiece!

B000E6UK5K|2.0|If you've already got the title track song, you've got the best thing about this CD, imo. I put this CD on at work, and it went by completely unnoticed...If Gilmore was interested in making a poignant, from-the-heart CD that captured his feelings, disposition, metabolic mojo , etc,etc...he probably succeeded brilliantly here. Unfortunately for me, that equaled 1 long, uneventful, musical listening nap...
B0000WN0ZK|1.0|This is really a lousy movie, and other reviewers have done an excellent job explaining why. But since the last review was done in 2005, and I just suffered through this film last night, I thought it was important to get a one star review on top of the review stack so that it is the first thing anyone considering this movie sees. <br /> <br />The positive, and unexpected, side of having seen this movie is that I had not anticipated that the review forum would be such a treasure trove of abstract nonsense. There are some real howlers in here, as well really classy vocab words and pseudo-intellectual phrases that work great at art gallery receptions or mixed together will get you at least a B an art history exam: \\"milieu\\", \\"intoxicating green\\", \\"argumentative fallacy (which apparently \\"precipitates\\"), \\"ad-hominem fallacy\\", \\"the immanence(sic) of meaning\\", \\"meaning's retreat\\", \\"effecting\\", \\"sullied with numerous derogatory connotations by the vox populi (later described as \\"callow reviewers)\\", \\"enconium\\" \\"[the] gnarled tongues of pamphleteering zealots [!]\\", \\"verdurous\\", \\"unperturbed\\", \\"meaning-indifferent configurations\\"...throw some of those around and people will really think you've this meaning of life thing solved!

This book could benefit the couple that is on the brink, as well as the couple that is good but wants to be great.  I read it as part of a premarital counseling course, and I loved it.  Maybe I loved it so much because I read it on the beach while vacationing in Cancun, Mexico...nah.  I loved it because it is great.  Simply great!

The rest of the CD has multiple and diversified musical surprises. Overall and keeping in mind that this is a recording from the late 80's it is worth the price.
B000BKJ78U|2.0|As a lover of film history, you would think that Lucas would want to preserve the original versions of his classic trilogy on DVD, but he seems determined to try to re-write history by flooding the market with still more copies of his monkeyed-with versions.  &lt;sigh!>  Just give us back the originals, George!

B000E6UK5K|3.0|Mr. Gilmour was quite happy with this effort and the collaborations that comprised the cd.  It is what he wanted to put out there.  It is not worth comparing it to anything before because it is where he is at now.  I would have loved to have \\"Comfortably Numb\\" but that has been done.  I am just happy to have something from that voice and that guitar that gives me goosebumps whenever it reaches that tender high-pitched moan.  This is not Pink Floyd but it is from the sound of The Floyd.  Not the words of Floyd, but definitely the sound.  If you saw Live 8, just be thankful that the solo work wasn't sung by Waters.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|The only way to have this release until now was on vinyl. The CD release before this had been tampered with to give it more of a modern/dance tone - and was not the real thing at all.

B000002H4Q|3.0|Double albums are usually the bane of artistry. Sure, it gives bands the opportunity to vent everything in their collective spleens at the moment it was recorded but all too often they succumb to indulgence. In this, the Cure are not immune. There are simply too many songs here that are just \\"OK\\" or mediocre and they bring down the album as a whole. Had the album been cut in size by half, this would be a much stronger collection.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br /><br />For the most part, it's the singles that fare best here. \\"Catch\\" is a delicate ballad carried along on a modest string (or at least synth string) arrangement. \\"Why Can't I Be You?\\" is 3 minutes of dizzy ecstasy helped along by a zippy horn arrangement. (\\"Everything you do is simply delicate/Everything you do is quite angelicate/Why can't I be you?\\") \\"Just Like Heaven\\" is the Cure at its most erotic (\\"'Show me how you do that trick/The one that makes me scream' she said\\") while \\"Hot! Hot! Hot!\\" is a bit more coy with its passion. (\\"Hey hey hey!!/But I like it when that lightning comes/Hey hey hey!!/Yes I like it alot\\") \\"How Beautiful You Are\\" is Smith venting his disgust at a former (girl?)friend when she encountered impoverished gypsies in the street. (\\"How Beautiful\\" was the thoughts of the gypsies reflected in their eyes while her reaction was 'I hate these people staring/Make them go away from me!'\\")\\"The Perfect Girl\\" is probably the best of the album tracks, a could've been single with a great keyboard riff.<br /><br />LOWS:<br /><br />Sure the riffing is loud on \\"The Kiss\\" but the song just never really goes anywhere. \\"Shiver and Shake\\" later in the album is a much better distillation of Smith's anger. (\\"You're just three sick holes that run like sores\\") \\"Fight\\" DOES sound like the Cure's attempt at writing a \\"pump your fist\\" arena rocker and as such it's a poor fit for the band.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Not essential. Most of the best tracks here are on GALORE or GREATEST HITS. Bigger Cure fans can get it and burn the best stuff (2,5,6,8,10,11,14,and 16) onto their own CD-R anthology.et it and burn the best stuff (2,5,6,8,10,11,14,and 16) onto their own CD-R anthology.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee most certainly deserves its place among the classics.  It is a book that teaches the coexistence of good and evil of society with a very unpredictable story.  The story starts out as simple as just three kids trying to get a mysterious neighbor by the name of Boo Radley out of his house.  The story soon changes to the main characters trying to clear an innocent black man, Tom Robinson, who was framed for a crime and will be sentenced to death.  At this point, the story with Boo Radley is almost completely ignored.  You then wonder what the point of the beginning was.  But soon after the outcome of the court trial of Tom Robinson, you then wonder where the story is really going.  When you arrive at the ending, everything will all come together.  This is one of those books that gives more than just one scenario but leaves you hanging before they can be concluded.  The ending of the book then closes any open ends of the story and brings you to the lesson that the book is really trying to teach.  A book's ending really determines how good the story is and To Kill a Mockingbird's ending is something you will never forget.  I recommend this book to anyone regardless of their taste in books.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|He's the best at looking em' in thee eye, he's the best at being cold hearted yet so passionate.

B000002KLG|5.0|I have the vynil version of this masterpiece since 1980 and the only reason why I want to get the CD version is because my favorite TURN OFF THE LAMPLIGHT is scratchy. This tune invites you to make love in a quiet way, no hurries, why?...Since my ears heard the intro on this cut more than a quarter century ago, it was like Mr. Benson telling me \\"I've got a song for you to share with your beloved one\\". Well I could tell you, folks, more on my feeling on this one, but it's enough. The only thing I hate on this album is the title song, the worst one, the 45 , crap-disco sound that disrespect the rest of the content. A must not only for smooth jazz fans. Ral Saavedra

It tells the background story for the upcoming trade blockade of Naboo, which was told in Episode I. It gives som background on how Lord Sidious manages to weaken the Chanceler's position, and pave the way for the election of Palpatine as Supreme Chancelor in the movie. It has a few surprises, and if you like Star Wars, give it a try. <br /> <br />Knut J. Norway.
0312330529|4.0|This is probably one of the nicest books I have read. If one has ever visited Bombay, he would be able to appreciate the precise description of the place, the people and the culture that the author has brought about. Since I am myself from Bombay, I can say that the author has done a great job in creating a mental picture in the mind of the reader of the place and the people by expressing his experiences so well. Inspite of the many superficial negatives that are visible from the outside, Bombay is a city with a soul and a big heart. As the author rightly puts it \\"you either love it or hate it\\".  <br />However, there are quite a few things that may not be accurate for Bombay now as the book was probably written about 2 decades ago. Would definitely recommend people to read this book.

B000E6UK5K|3.0|David Gilmour has not been the most prolific of Pink Floyd's members in solo efforts - after all, this is an effort after 22 years.  This album continues in the vein of his past work - fairly mediocre, without the traces of 'psychedleic commercialism' that marked Momentary, or for that matter, his contributions to The Wall. <br />While his technique has never been questioned, and his style never in doubt, what stands out is that Gilmour was Gilmour only because of the overriding influences of Waters, and the 'ghost' of Barrett.  His music, otherwise, has been fairly listen-able, but never outstanding. <br />Here Gilmour produces the same as always, with substantial influences of what is currently on - strange sounds and 'other' music (what we refer to as World Music). <br />Though listenable, I would not rank this album in the 'Exceptionable' list. But for a hard core Floyd fan, as I am, and for one who HAS to own anything and everything that Floyd ever released, buy it - there will not be too many more, even if Waters replies with a 'In the Deeep Blue Sea' or 'On the Moon and Mars'.

B000000WJZ|5.0|I would think that most Smashing Pumpkin fans consider \\"Siamese Dream\\" the band's finest and most consistent album.  It's not all that different than \\"Gish,\\" just an improvement in every way.  The instrumental work, lyrics, and overall song quality are quite extraordinary.  As everyone knows, probably the most remarkable thing about the band (Billy Corgan really, since he writes almost all of the songs by himself) is their ability to rock hard, play soft, and even become theatrical, sometimes all in the same song. <br /> <br />Three of my favorite hard rocking Pumpkin classics are \\"Cherub Rock,\\" \\"Quiet,\\" and \\"Geek U.S.A.\\" -- just perfect songs with that signature thrumming bass and rhythm guitar sound, and the relentless Jimmy Chamberlin on drums.  \\"Today\\" proves that Corgan can pen a more pop-oriented hit when he wants to.  \\"Disarm,\\" probably one of the band's best songs, showcases Corgan's theatrical proclivities, almost bombastic at times (we would hear much more of this style on the band's next album).  Other (perhaps less obvious) standouts are \\"Rocket\\" and \\"Mayonaise.\\" <br /> <br />My only criticism of \\"Siamese Dream\\" concerns the songs \\"Hummer\\" and \\"Silverf***\\" both of which go on for too long.  The latter, in fact, could have been a much better straightforward four minute rocker.  But these are minor quibbles of what is otherwise an all-time classic album.  I only wish the Pumpkins had maintained their high quality for a longer period of time.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Of course everyone knows that this album is a masterpiece. It's Lauyrn's greatest work. Regardless what people say about Lauryn Hill she is remarkable.

B0000DBJDM|5.0|Live at Pompeii is one of those movies that once you watch it you know you're going to watch it time and time again. Being a Pink Floyd fan I'm a little partial, but the cinemotography makes it worthwhile for even the casual listener. Amazing shots coupled with amazing music is why this movie gets 5 stars from me. Mademoiselle Nobs is maybe one of the most unusual things I've ever seen: two men and a dog can produce some pretty good sounding blues. Definately recommend buying this one.
B000E33VWW|5.0|P. S. Hoffman won a well-deserved Best Actor award for his turn as Truman Capote. After years of stealing the show from other actors, in work as diverse and good as his roles in Boogie Nights, Punch Drunk Love, and Owning Mahowny (and he was the only reason to see dreck like Along Came Polly), he now has his statue. He is excellent as Capote, who comes across as brilliant and charming, but also self-centered and very manipulative. At Harper Lee's party for her \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird,\\" Capote sulks, drinks, and hisses, \\"I don't see what all the fuss is about.\\" He can't share in the joy of his lifelong friend. It's all about him. He paid a high price for getting his story, however. What made Capote a superstar, the \\"non-fiction novel\\" \\"In Cold Blood,\\" also sucked the life out him: he never wrote another book. In the film, we see a writer obsessed. Truman is in love with the doomed Perry Smith, but he wants even more to get, and tell, a great story. When he hears that Smith might have his execution delayed, Truman fears he'll have a \\"nervous breakdown.\\" You might not like Truman Capote after seeing this movie, but you'll want to read him--if you haven't already--or read more of his books. Hoffman completely embodies his character. Without his great performance, the movie wouldn't have worked. But the supporting roles are well played, too. One of last year's best movies.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never paid much attention to Firefly when it was on TV.  I think I saw \\"The Train Job\\" episode, and while I didn't hate it, I didn't want to watch a space western.  It was unfortunate for me that the one episode I saw is probably the worst of the bunch, and doesn't really reflect the rest of the series.  A friend lent this to me and my wife, and we ended up enjoying it immensely.     <br /> <br />\\"The Train Job\\" is on the first DVD of this box set, which is the tough DVD to get through.  All television series take a few episodes for the actors and writers to settle into character, and Firefly is no exception.  After the first disc, you may be on the fence about this show.  But after you charge right into disc 2, you will be hooked.  The characters and stories and interesting and complex, and are set in a plausible and pretty realistic future galaxy.  Really, the only bad thing about this show is that it comes to an end.  The special features are interesting, as are the commentaries featured on several episodes. <br /> <br />Anyone who enjoys good science fiction television will enjoy this box set.  I'd go so far as to say that anyone who just enjoys quality television of any genre will enjoy \\"Firefly.\\"
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I am pleasantly surprised by this latest work from Mr. David Gilmour.  I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan and I heartily agree that this is by far one of the best of the Floyd solo albums.  I own every Floyd album, every solo albums, and tons of bootlegs so I am quite well informed in the ways of the almighty Floyd.  I'll take my previous statement one step further and say that it is probably better than the last two Pink Floyd outings, \\"Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" and \\"The Division Bell\\".  The entire CD is very interesting to listen to and doesn't feel forced in the slightest.  It has a great flow with many beautiful moments of sonic soundscapes to entice the ear.  I always thought that MLOR and Division Bell sounded too much like they were trying to sound like Pink Floyd.  \\"On An Island\\" has many of the aspects of Floyd that I love and they sound so natural in these songs.  This is Gilmour at his best.  His playing is flawless and his tone is incredible, as always.  This CD will appeal mostly to Floyd fans but should still hold up to the casual listener.  It's certainly a purchase I have not a single regret in having made.  Good work, Mr. Gilmour!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|When the film was first released, somehow I thought all the praises and wonderful reviews were just hype. After seeing this movie on Yahoo's box office chart for ages, I've decided to watch its trailer, and wept.    I went to watch BM the day after the Academy Awards, and felt that for me, it was the best film of the year. Although the movie was based on a short story, they've enriched the characters so much that made you felt like you've loved for a lifetime as well.     What surprised me the most was that although I went in to the movie with my own expectations and thoughts about some scences, while watching the movie, I did not once find myself thinking and analyzing.  The emotions seeped out from the screen in waves and circled me into its realm, and I appreciate this element very much. I walked out of the theater feeling that I understood a bit more about how others live, have lived, and that particular sentiment will not be forgotten easily.    Ang Lee said he only wanted to make a love story.  What a love story he made.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|Having felt somewhat jaded by the lack of content in music over the last 10 years or so, I was longing for a seminal album from ANYONE.  It seems that musicians have enough time on their hands to at least make buying their CD a worthwhile experience but I digress.  Just in time comes David Gilmour with the best album I've heard in a LONG TIME: On an Island.  Right from the beginning I can tell that this isn't going to be another \\"over-the-hill\\" attempt at re-inventing himself.  Gilmour stays true to his roots with this album.  The amazing orchestral work done by Robert Zielger and recorded at Abbey Road Studios lends a color to the record that sucks you in.  Gilmour has a few of his buddies as guests such as David Crosby and Graham Nash singing on the title track.  The melodies and vocal arrangements brought back the goosebumps I used to get listening to The Wall.  The familiar tone, sound, and warmth of his guitar playing only compliment the fact that Gilmour has certainly mastered his craft as a guitarist and we get to hear it throughout. In short, Gilmour is in his best form of his life not only as a gifted guitarist and singer, but as an artist.  This album is history in the making, and we get front row seats.

PLUS, she is a meddlesome, sharp-tongued busybody who tries to control everyone around her, regardless of their own preferences. When finally called to task by her best friend, Mr. Knightly, a neighbor who routinely visits her father, she is forced to confront her worst attributes, admit to them and start to mend her fences.  Of course, anyone who has seen \\"Clueless\\" knows that Mr. Knightly is also Mr. Right.
B000E1155E|5.0|Thank heaven that some actual rock music has been coming out of the music scene lately, and it isn't all James Blunt and the painfully boring emo/shoegazing ilk. In reading the reviews posted here, I simply can't believe that no one has mentioned the ill fated Libertines as an obvious influence on these gents- they really do seem to have taken that sound and run with it. Not a clone, mind you; but you can  absolutely hear the backstory. I hope these guys are around longer than the Libs- I want to hear what they come up with next. Get this, you'll be very glad you did!
0783240287|3.0|This delightful little piece was created for a boys' school many years ago. It is a humorous re-telling of the Old Testament story of Joseph and his brothers who sell him into slavery in Egypt. Because it is both funny and heart-warming,  it has been in production ever since. Joseph offers many varieties of music, from a Country/Western howdown (\\"One More Angel in Heaven\\"), to a French Apache-dance lament (\\"Zose Canaan Days...\\"), and a howlingly funny \\"Grovel Grovel\\" when the brothers are literally brought to their knees. Watch it!
B00000K2W1|5.0|I was very pleased with the overall arrangement of the CD.  Very well put together and the sound is awesome.  It's hard to believe Janis sang as far back as she did.  I was thoroughly pleased with the music, and this is probably one of the best, if not the best, \\"back in the day\\" music selection I have bought to date.  My daughter loved it too!  A definite worth adding to anyone's collection.  Talk about bringing back memories.
B00008CLOA|4.0|Yes, I'm not here to bash Pink Floyd. They are titanic in the world of musical evolution and this album receives well-deserved acclaim. There are also others like Animals that don't get the acclaim they deserve, which shows even more just how ideal of a group they were. And that's because without getting lots of money for the truly deserving works, they still produce highest caliber art. And it's on this line of thought that I review this album.<br /><br />The 30th Anniversary Edition seems to me to be another way to make some more money off the name Dark Side of the Moon. It looks like a hastily-assembled and -produced remaster of the album. The reason I say this is because of very small things that would have never been overlooked if someone was meaning to remaster it with care. Typo on the CD spine (as stated in a spotlight review, good call. I thought I was the only one who noticed that). The biggest pain in my musical ass is the track index positions. Everything is screwed up when you consider how the album was originally released. Breaks are in the wrong spots and it takes a good bit of the intention and feeling out of the songs. Also, the mixing is defacing to the emotions of the songs too. The lead parts don't stand out as much, and the backup clouds the mix more than something should which is dubbed as backup. Get a different version.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|What a wonderful CD.  This is by far his best solo effort and is probably better than the last 2 Floyd CD's as well.  I've only listened to it twice, but the word that best sums up the effort is \\"smooth\\".   <br /> <br />Gilmour's dripping guitar chords permeate this marvelous CD, which definitely has a \\"Floydian Sound\\" to it, but also sounds like something a bit different too that I can't quite put my finger on yet.  Maybe it's the Polly Samson or David Crosby influence, but I think that David's lyric writing has finally reached the level of his music writing, which I don't think occurred in his earlier efforts.   <br /> <br />Also, there's good variety in the music from fast songs like \\"Take a breath\\" to the more mellow \\"Then I close my Eyes\\", the simple \\"Smile\\", and there's great harmonies on the title track.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars, but since you can't give 1/2, I'll give it 5. <br /> <br />The packaging is cool too, and the only downside for me was not getting the bonus CD that was bundled in the cd at other retailers.   <br /> <br />Now, how about that final Floyd record and a tour with Roger?
B000024D4R|5.0|This album is on par with Dark Side of the Moon, and yeah Dark Side gets lots of publicity and attention, but hey it deserves it. Gilmour's guitar work on Animals is expressive of his true capability to play the perfect note each time without overplaying. I mention Dark Side because if the world was a fair place, Animals would have just as much critical acclaim. Give it a listen and you'll see that not only is the music outstanding, but the lyrical work is, in my opinion, the most intelligent and meaningful collection of thoughts that Pink Floyd has ever produced. This is a must have not just for the Floyd fan, but for anyone who A) respects good music, and B) is looking for another dimension to Pink Floyd where popular albums such as Dark Side may have failed you. And, if you like Animals, get Wish You Were Here and examine the tracks for Shine On You Crazy Diamond. They are as overlooked on that album as Animals is as a whole.
B0006Z2LP6|4.0|Very rarely does a great motion picture introduce both education and entertainment in such detail. Some years ago, when I was a boy, I was a space-science geek,- going to Space Camp in Hustsville, Al. And after reading \\"Five-To-One Moon\\", an autobiography by Buzz Aldrin, I was hooked.<br /><br />Although I'm not too much into space or drama movies anymore, I was pleased to see this movie. Moreover, it touches upon the astronaut's personal lives. It includes a good plot, action, drama, mystery, and suspense that a good motion picture should have. I commend director ron howard...good job, Mr. Howard.<br /><br />I also recommend getting only the 2-disc Anniversary Edition. It's a must to understand the FULL story and understand the struggles and acheivements by NASA.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I recommend this powerful, moving film to anyone. Aronofsky uses some quick-cut imagery to sequence getting high. He shows us every in and out of a druggies life, at times melodic and then disturbing and awful as the characters enter the downward spiral.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|I avoided watching this film for many reasons.  One, I was tired of military films.  They never depicted my experience.  Two, I couldn't picture Gyllanhal as a marine. <br />I was wrong.  I watched this movie in the theatre with my friends (all civilians).  And they didn't get the impact I felt.  I was with 3rd MARDIV for 3 years as a corpsman.  Even living and playing with marines, I never understood what made them this way.  A lot of them were young 20 year olds like me.  But totally unlike me. People that watch this movie and hate it either are brainwashed marines and associates or totally naive civilians.  This isn't a war movie, but it is a military movie.  Most importantly , it is a movie about the Marine Corps.   <br />The Swofford character shows the viewer a perspective that doesn't agree with the line about the military.  It's not all clean uniforms and following orders.  You have to deal with super-sh*t.  And once you sign that contract, your life is changed. <br />The truth hurts, and I believe this movie brings a lot of truth to light.
B000002KD9|5.0|Though the searing, controversial rocker \\"Southern Man\\" still sounds out-of-place among the many beautiful melodies assembled here, \\"After the Gold Rush\\" is essentially a perfect album. Neil Young's fragile voice renders his poignant songs even more peculiar and heartbreaking than they already are. A five-plus star recording.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I picked up the album when it came out and the album exceded my expectations. I love pink floyd but none of their solo work really atracted me. I had purchased David's other solo albums, and I can honestly say that it is his best. It does lack some progressive qualities that I like about the Floyd, but it integrates some blues and jazzy folk. This album is a must for all floyd lovers, and for people who love jazz rock. The only dislike I have with this album is there is not enough upbeat songs. Even though that sounds kind of shallow if I like Floyd but for it to appeal to the public and everyday listeners they have to be able to have good musical taste. With todays taste in music it might be hard to find listeners. Thats all but over all a good album that I do not regret buying, also the extra Island Jam song is sweet.
B000001FRY|4.0|Is this album Auctung Baby or Joshua Tree? Not at all.It lacks any major hits like every other U2 album exept october. It doesn't have any emotion that the other albums have, so why buy it? Because it is the funnest U2 album out their. This is their only album you can play that contains consistent up beat tunes. And the slower songs are briliant and eerie. I Will Follow is the most famous song, but by no means the best. Out Of Control, A Cat Dubh, Stories for boys, A Day Without me, and the best song on the album, The Electric Co. The rest are good, and contribute a lot to the album. The Edge is very loose on the guitar, and has many fun guitar parts. <br /> <br />Yes, U2 has put out some of the best rock music ever, but buy this and don't compare it to other u2 stuff, but to your favorite rock band who isn't u2, and you will love this album.
B000055ZB8|5.0|Nosferatu is the first Dracula adaptation and it stands apart and alone from all the other versions, from Christopher Lee to Gary Oldman. Shrek plays the vampire as a man suffering from an illness instead of a flamboyant caped playboy. With his bat-like ears and rat-like fangs, he seems more animal than human. I didn't find the movie scary, but it is haunting. This DVD has excellent bonus features like two music scores, an audio essay commentary and lots of production stills as well as photos of Expressionist art that influenced Murnau's dark vision, like paintings by Edward Munch, Adolph Menzel, Franz Mare and Casper David Friedrich. There are even current photographs of the many of the actual locations that were used in the film in case you feel like taking your own Nosferatu tour. A classic masterpiece that stands on it's own and still has the power to disturb. If you liked this, check out Werner Herzog's 1979 remake with Klaus Kinski and Isabella Adjani.
0142000655|3.0|This was an excellent novel, mainly because John Steinbeck made a clever, astute, and contemporary version of a modern Adam and Even/Cain and Abel story. The most exemplary attribute of East of Eden is how one can coherently see how the story of Cain and Abel is no different from the story of everyday people. Somehow I had a better understanding of Cain and Abel and the idea of \\"original sin\\" from reading this novel, which is something that's definitely worth acknowledging on Steinbeck's credit. However, there's also a major flaw to East of Eden. At times it felt a bit bombastic and pretentious. The characters were very interesting, however they felt more like biblical symbols than real characters. Obviously that was Steinbeck's purpose, but it made them appear VERY one dimensional (for instance: Why is Cathy all bad? Why is Cal the least loved? Why is Aron the most loved? Why is Cal the least liked because he has brown hair, and Aron the most loved because he has blonde hair and blue eyes?). So therefore, it made me a bit detached from the characters, and it felt a bit unrealistic and predictable. However, despite that, there are still many scenes in the novel that felt inspiring, so much that I nearly clapped for the character (Adam) when he finally confronted his fears. It doesn't really touch on new ground about the concept of good and evil, but East of Eden is a novel worth reading at least once.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I watch it 2 to 3 times on groundhog day. <br />Just love the story.
B0007GAERG|4.0|the album is serious and well written. <br />lyrics are strong and great.  <br />melodies and beats are awesome enough. <br />it's her best work. <br />
0930289528|5.0|Truly a great piece of fiction, \\"V for Vendetta\\" is as politically relevent today as it ever was. This is high quality work from beginning to end. It's well paced and exciting without being cheapened by too much action. Avoids comic book cliches such as excessive thought bubbles, motion lines, and onomatopoeia. The artwork is simplistic and honest, and the writing is spot on for all the characters. I'd expect no less from the man who brought us \\"Watchmen.\\" This is an absolute must read for not only fans of comics, but everyone who enjoys an intelligent, dark, and mature story.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Millers's Crossing is a perfect gem of a jewel that improves with each viewing.  About the third time I had deduced all of the characters' names and their parts in this rather complex caricature of the 1920s New York underworld, city hall corruption, bookmaking and prohibition.  Jon Polito's opening declamation is peerless in speech and facial expressions.  Every scene, every word, every gesture is choreographed by the Coens with a precision equal to the stellar cinemetography of Barry Sonenfeld.

B000E1ZBH2|2.0|I have both the BBC and the current edition of this movie.  The current one, nominated for an award of an Oscar, is a travesty of Jane Austen's beautiful novel.  Where has the taste and judgement of the movie industry gone?  I might suggest that Donald Sutherlin go find a sequel for MASH. Please go look at the earlier edition. <br /> <br />John Bowen, M.D. <br />
B000068IEU|1.0|This had to be THE WORST horror or scary movie of all time. I have seen some bad movies in my time, but this one took the cake. I lost 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. I wouldn't give this movie a 1/2 star, but 1 star is the minimum. The cover looked pretty good and the online reviews were positive. One jackass even said it was the scariest movie they have ever seen. They were probably from Mayberry. The plot was horrible. The acting was worse. I really believe the person who ok'd the project was fired!! DO NOT SPEND MONEY on this movie. I made the mistake of buying the movie based on reviews.(ha,ha the joke was on me)
B000001IPP|5.0|Someone on down the line of reviews wrote in dislike of this album <br /> <br />\\"All the songs sound the same. <br />The singer can't sing. <br />Some of the songs are only a minute long. <br />It sounds like a dog went through the slaughterhouse.\\" <br /> <br />I disagree with his first line, and the rest all I can say is... dude, thats why they are so f**kn awesome! Hell, I would be honored to hear that my album \\"sounds like a dog went through a slaughterhouse.\\"  This album will blow you away.  Tim's lyrics incredible voice blow you away yet again.  If Tim were to do books on tape, i would buy the books even if they were bad books just to listen to his voice, despite the fact that I wouldn't know what he was saying. <br /> <br />My advise for any new listener to rancid. pick up an album. listen to it 4 times, on the fifth time you will be hooked for life.  They are definitely the heroin of music.
B00005T7I1|3.0|I always liked this movie when I was a little kid. Now I watched it again and paid more attention to the plot and not the bright comic book colors. I think it's a decent movie to see. I would give it a B-. I like the colors from the movie it looks like a comic book in motion.

B00001OH7N|2.0|\\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" is an album that established a reputation-- David Bowie, pop songster and pyschedelic folkster, did a dramatic about-face and reinvented himself as a dark metal rocker.  In 2006, this sort of reinvention of Bowie is something that was expected, but in 1970, this must have been rather unexpected.  Influencing this change was no doubt the presecne of guitar hero Mick Ronson, whose embracing of distortion and feedback made this entirely possible.  The results of this change, quite honestly, are a lot more mixed then most Bowie fans would lead you to believe-- \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" has been elevated to cult status and truthfully it's not that the album is bad per se, it's just that it's not particularly exciting. <br /> <br />Bowie lets us know right away that things have changed-- \\"Width of a Circle\\" is an extended cut drenched in feedback and distorted guitars with a galloping bassline (played by producer Tony Visconti) and a rambling vocal from Bowie.  No doubt it woke a lot of people up as to the change of direction, and it proves to be a decent number.  But Bowie seems incapable of really sustaining this and seems unsure how to integrate it into his idiom-- \\"All the Madmen\\" starts as a bleak acoustic ballad before overdriven guitars and a downright irritating synth line get in the way, \\"After All\\" ends up being a dull Lou Reedish ballad, and many of the metalish pieces are pretty much unmemorable (\\"She Shook Me Cold\\", the lyrically fantastic \\"Running Gun Blues\\").  The album closes on a high note, with the bizarre folk/metal fusion title track (made famous decades later by Nirvana's performance of it on MTV) and the fractured, paranoid, and downright bizarre metal churn of \\"The Superman\\", but the album is a bit too inconsistent to be a completely satisfying listen. <br /> <br />There's enough on here to make it worth a pickup for those exploring Bowie's catalog, but he'd do siginificantly better work in the very near future.  Thisone is more a curiosity.
B000AARKOO|4.0|I was one of many people who skipped watching Kingdom of Heaven until today. The reason? It seemed like a typical medival war movie and a pretty boy Orlando Bloom as the main character just turned me off. I mean, we all saw him dressed as a warrior in Troy. But just as I was wrong about The Last Samurai, I was wrong again.  <br /> <br />Bloom, as Bailon, carried the movie pretty well. It worked mostly because of a great script and great execution. There were several supurb characters that strengthened this movie. Bailon's Father played by Neeson. The leper king. And most of all, Muslim king Saladin. Saladin is a significant historical figure, and I did not know about him until I watched this movie. His character was accurately portrayed and if you don't know him, you need to watch this movie like me. <br /> <br />I really liked the way this movie emphasized the theme of \\"honor\\" and \\"peace\\". It sends a great message for our generation. The only thing I did not like about the movie was Bailon's romance with the queen. They just put that in because a movie needs a little romance. But that was terrible Without it, Kingdom of Heaven would have been perfect. But then, how many perfect movies are there?
B00006L7XQ|5.0|And Hell followed with him.  .  . <br /> <br />I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel. <br /> <br />I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real. <br /> <br />\\"But I remember everything. . .\\" <br /> <br />This is the penultimate Cash record.  I am not a Johnny Cash fan, but I found him via the movie \\"Walk The Line\\" and I am not ashamed to admit so. <br /> <br />\\"And don't forget to give my love to rose.\\"
B000AMJDHY|4.0|First of all, I agree that this really shouldn't be labled under punk, it's more of of a power-pop/dance sound but no worse for it! <br />I was really impressed with the musical versatility shown on this album, also considering that the bandmembers are so young. The lyrics are good and often witty and thought provoking as well. I must admit that I'm only listening from track 6 onwards most of the time because the previous tracks just don't offer much, they even get a bit tedious after a while (hence 4 stars). <br />Saying that though, I am ABSOLUTLEY HOOKED on the second part of the CD and to me \\"There's A Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet\\" is a real stand-out song (btw why do the titles never have much to do with the songs?!). The vaudville style piano give the later songs a certain edge and combined with the brass and string sections as well as erratic rhythms it just works really well. <br />The Intro and Intermission are cute ideas, but I honestly don't feel like listening to them again and again. <br />Of course they're not the Sex Pistols, but...thank god ^^.
B00001OH7P|5.0|\\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\\" is one of those records generally regarded as stunningly brilliant, critically acclaimed, commercially successful, everything comes together, blah blah. <br /> <br />Of course, in this case, they're pretty much right. <br /> <br />David Bowie was peaking-- he'd explored a number of different styles and suddenly found himself knee-deep in the glam movement with a backing band featuring guitarist Mick Ronson that had been together for several years, and a string of largely unsuccessful but unnervingly daring (and at times brilliant) albums behind him.  'Ziggy Stardust' is a concept album of sorts, about the (for that of better term) rise and fall of a brilliant musician from space named Ziggy Stardust.  Remarkably, it's not nearly as goofy as it sounds. <br /> <br />Instead, it ends up being a remarkably well performed and diverse album-- Bowie's vocals have developed a depth and a swagger and an utter lack of fear of styles and in Ronson, he had a lead guitarist capable of matching him in personality.  As a songwriter, Bowie had found his niche-- whether it was picking the far corners of exotica (\\"Soul Love\\") or embracing the new glam sounds (\\"Suffragette City\\"), he was able to pull off something powerful and convincing throughout.  The album is pretty much one long highlight, depending on your point of view-- at any given time I find myself in love with impassioned ballad \\"Five Years\\", glam masterpiece (\\"Moonage Daydream\\") or the hook laden \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", but there's not a bad song here, freom the rolling introductory drum beats to Bowie's impassioned screams on \\"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\\". <br /> <br />The reality is, as far as early '70s rock goes, it really doesn't get any better than this (although getting the 2CD edition with a disc full of bonus tracks helps).  Essential listening.
0156029065|4.0|Baudolino starts the book distressed, his right road lost. He has killed a man, a long-time friend, which is against his own morals that permit lying but forbid killing. He ends up describing this event, as well as his life's story, to a historian Master Niketas, his Virgil or shrink, looking to make sense of his whole life. A book later, Niketas, living up to the maxim \\"it's not what you know, it's whom you know\\", brings a blind wise man Paphnutius, who can see right through Baudolino's stories, solves the mystery of another murder and, to Baudolino's shock, points out that it was Baudolino himself who inadvertently killed another man, his adopted father Frederick, the Holy Roman Emperor. Horrified, Baudoloino then does some soul searching, finds god inside and, made whole with this knowledge, goes back into the world to settle some old debts.    This is a nice wrapper around the chronicle of Baudolino's life blended with historic events, myths and religion in the 1100s. The kernel plot is quite engaging, especially since history is often more striking when served as a little bit of spice to somebody's personal story. History and Baudolino's biography are always vying for the primary spot. Baudolino spends most of the book working towards Frederick's glory, and with it - the glory of a Great European Empire. It is Baudolino, the pragmatic visionary, who suggests to Frederick the idea of independent universities, and with them - the idea of the freedom of thought, and it is he again who works on having Frederick's rule recognized by the Pope (a fake letter from Prester John and a fake Holy Grail notwithstanding). Perhaps, Baudolino embodies the author's own longing for a colorful and benevolent force working for the benefit of a greater and better Europe? In addition to giving Baudolino the leading role in some of the most important events of his time, Eco endows him with \\"all a man must know for a complete life: poverty, love, and war\\" (O.Henry).    Baudolino is, basically, a mensch. He may be somewhat of a schemer, but he does not have an evil bone in his body. It is perhaps a reflection of the author's belief in some general good that the history of the fairly rough and tumble 1100s is shown as a commentary to such a man.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|While I would much prefer this to be a Waters\Gilmour Floyd album, I have thoroughly enjoyed it. It seems pigs will be seen on the wing before we see what was on stage at Live 8 again, so I am very happy. I enjoy the instrumentals, which everyone knows are David's strongpoints, and the lyrics are better each time I listen. I would give an A+ on the music and A-\B+ on the lyrical side. I have tickets for the Rosemont show in April, so I am loving life. The naysayers expect too much and are trying to compare this effort to Pink Floyd, which it is not. This is a great album. Any Floyd fan will enjoy it.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|I am waiting on my copy of \\" On An Island \\" to arrive from Amazon...but, I have heard the album all the way through on my local radio station and I am very impressed. <br />I have recently been buying some of the Pink Floyd cds and want to get more of them. <br />When I heard this cd on the radio...I knew immediately I had to add \\" On An Island \\" to my cd collection. <br />Full of the passion and soul that David Gilmour is known for. <br />This cd was sold out at the local music store and I am glad I had it pre-ordered.
B000002JR8|5.0|\\"Far Beyond Driven\\" is the record where Pantera reached the apex of their creative powers. Songs like \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" and \\"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\\" definitely exhibit the band's talent and the best they have to offer. This album is the group's answer to Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction and Danzig's 4 albums. Technically, the tracks in this record are precise and efficient and will surely give Slayer and Metallica a run for their money. Frankly, all those bands' albums will not amount to what this record has accomplished. The bass and the drums provide a perfect background for Dimebag Darrell's guitar exhibitions. Lyrically, Phil Anselmo has crafted some of the most shocking and poetic words in songs such as Becoming and 25 Years. All in all, this album is truly the band's real masterpiece and should have truly won Grammy's best metal album, not mainstream dross like Tool's Aenima.
B00003CXCT|5.0|We can say what we want about George Lucas and his short-comings with his Star Wars films.  We can moan and groan over the fact that the man is a perfectionist who can't just leave a film alone.  So, he hasn't heard the expression, \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\"  Or if he has, he's certainly not paying attention to it.  We can also get upset that he likes to play down to his audiences.<br /><br />However, we sometimes forget that this is Star Wars.  It's easy to not enjoy his latest films because they did not create the stir in cinema history like his first film which literally changed the way we see movies today.  Jaws may have been the first summer blockbuster hit, but Star Wars blew the doors off.  No film like it had ever been made up until that time.  Yes, there were television shows such as Star Trek and Space 1999 that tried to jumpstart science fiction.  In many ways, they succeeded.  But there was something infinitely more magical about Star Wars.  The story is simple, while the special effects, especially for 1977, would transport the viewers to a time and place never conceived of before.<br /><br />First of all, these DVDs look great!  The restoration is beautifully done.  The colors have never been more vivid and alive.  Nor have the sounds.  They look better now than ever before.<br /><br />Star Wars<br /><br />Despite George Lucas's changing the title, I still think of Star Wars as the original.  To my mind, it is still the best entry second only to the Empire Strikes Back.  And, yep, George directed this one, which embodies his best work.  Perhaps it is because he didn't have the technology to bury the story and dialogue that we find a good story and decent dialogue.<br /><br />Even by today's standards, the opening sequence still looks fantastic as the Star Destroyer chases down the Rebel Blockade Runner with a monstrous on-board battle to follow.<br /><br />Alec Guiness is still wonderful as the ever-wise sage, Obi-Wan Kenobi who leads our young band of heroes on a daring rescue attempt of Princess Leia on board the dreaded Death Star.<br /><br />I still remember the wonderful fantasy of romping around on a huge space station blasting stormtroopers.  Lucas plays right into the dreams of every hot-blooded American boy.  Cowboys quickly seemed superfluous by comparison to having a laser gun!<br /><br />The final battle still holds up and is still George Lucas's best space battle out of all the films he's done.  It's more personal and gripping as Luke Skywalker attempts to destroy the Death Star with Darth Vader about to blow him to bits.  The is especially true as his shipmates are destroyed one by one.<br /><br />The performances are great too.  Harrison Ford as the sarcastic Han Solo reminds you of his more likeable character to follow, Indiana Jones.  Mark Hamill also turns in his best performance of the trilogy.  Carrie Fisher is great, but her best performance would actually be in the next film.  And, as always, there's the loveable droids, C-3PO and R2-D2 (Lucas's favorite character).<br /><br />Most of the additional scenes are good.  I still don't like Han Solo chasing stormtroopers around a corner to find himself facing 100 of them.  They're just standing there!  I find this unlikely, especially when he's chased back by the same small squad that he chased to begin with.  I found the original version of him running into a dead end more humorous and effective.<br /><br />Empire Strikes Back<br /><br />Still the best entry in both the original trilogy and overall.  Empire Strikes Back is one of the best science fiction films ever made.  George Lucas hands over the directing to Irving Kushner.  Aside from Episode 3, this is the darkest of the films with Darth Vader, obsessed with finding Luke Skywalker, chasing Han Solo and the Millenium Falcon all over the galaxy.<br /><br />The shift from the hot desert of Tatooine to the ice planet of Hoth is an effective move, especially the climactic battle in thesnow that sends the rebel forces running for their lives.<br /><br />Finally, we are introduced to one of the best characters, not only in Star Wars, but cinema history: Yoda.  Frank Oz provides a charm to Yoda as Luke, at first, does not know who he is.  Yoda may stand only 2 feet tall, but his wisdom is colossal as Luke quickly realizes when Yoda forces him to confront his fears.<br /><br />Let the Han vs. Leia begin!  The banter between these two characters is simply classic!  Right from the get-go, these two, unwilling to share their true feelings, find themselves locked in a one-liner combat.  \\"I'd just as soon kiss a wookie,\\" snaps Leia.  \\"I can arrange that!  You could use a good kiss!\\" Han fires back.<br /><br />Everything from the asteroid field to Han's fate in the carbon freezing chamber in Cloud City is perfect.  But nothing prepares you for the dreaded secret as Luke Skywalker chooses to face Darth Vader.  The sad part is that new viewers will never have this surprise because obviously Luke is Anakin's son.  But, as a viewer back in 1980, it was simply haunting to hear Vader say, \\"No, Luke.  I am your father.\\"  I still remember the hush that fell over the audience once those words were uttered.<br /><br />Empire Strikes Back is as close to perfect as any Star Wars film has come.  It balances adventure, romance, spiritual depth, and humor all in one.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi<br /><br />Probably few films have ever held as much anticipation as this one did.  Empire Strikes Back left us with a major cliff-hanger.  What would happen to Han Solo?  What about Luke's Jedi training that he neglected?  Who is this mysterious \\"other\\" that Yoda refers to?<br /><br />Unfortunately, Return of the Jedi is one of the weakest entries into the Star Wars saga, if not the weakest.<br /><br />First of all, nearly half the film is spent on Han Solo's rescue.  We find that Luke has suddenly acquired his Jedi Powers.  We don't know exactly how much time has elapsed since the end of the Empire Strikes Back.  But, the rescue of Han isn't the meat of the story.  The plot and the attempt to finally destroy the evil Empire is where the focus really belongs, and only an hour and 15 minutes or so, simply isn't long enough to do this.<br /><br />Revenge of the Sith was far more effective because the entire film was based on the fall of the Republic and Anakin Skywalker.  Lucas also used 2 hours and 40 minutes to do it.<br /><br />Another weak entry is the Ewoks.  To my mind, only Jar Jar was worse.  A little too cutsy, and entirely unbelieveable that little teddy-bears with spears could out-fight AT-STs and a legion of stormtroopers.  I understand that their objective was to provide a diversion, but even this is not very credible.  It would have been far more effective had George been able to go with his original intentions of a planet of wookies.<br /><br />George Lucas has said that he loves to show 3-4 things going on simultaneously.  But, he isn't very good at it.  Instead, he sacrifices a lot of story by constantly jumping between Luke and Vader, the battle on Endor, and the battle in space.  He may have been more successful, had he made the film longer so that he could devote the necessary time to each to make them even more compelling.<br /><br />Another problem I had was with Han Solo.  Even Harrison Ford had to practically be begged to come back as he was very dissatisfied with Han Solo.  Han goes from a confident sarcastic character to a love-lorne milksop!  All he can think about is Leia and it becomes very old, very fast.<br /><br />Even though Return of the Jedi is the weakest entry, I still feel the original trilogy is the best.  More attention was paid to the characters and story.<br /><br />There are enough extras and bonus features to keep the most avid fan busy.  The commentaries are fun to listen to.<br /><br />Even after all these years, you still can't go wrong with Star Wars.  And Star Wars still set the tone for allsci-fi films to follow.  My only hope is that George will leave well-enough alone.  Most of his additional footages are fine.  It will be interesting in 10-15 years to find out what changes he has in mind for the new trilogy.<br /><br />Enjoy the best sci-fi trilogy ever made. Somehow, you never get tired of watching them!wers.  We don't know exactly how much time has elapsed since the end of the Empire Strikes Back.  But, the rescue of Han isn't the meat of the story.

B00001OH7M|3.0|Often considered David Bowie's debut, \\"Space Oddity\\" (as it is now titled-- it's been released under a couple different names) is actually Bowie's second album, but it's the one on which he began to build his substantial legacy. <br /> <br />The portrait that \\"Space Oddity\\" paints of Bowie is that of a psychedelic folk/rock performer, complete with oddball string arrangements, acoustic ballads, expressionist lyrics, and so on.  What helps this rise above the stew of every other 1969 psychedelic folk/rock album is the strength of Bowie's performance-- already at this early stage in his career (and at the precocious age of 22), Bowie's sound and style is instantly recognizable in the performance.  The title track, a hit several years later, has all the hallmarks of a great Bowie track-- fantastic vocal, curious double meanings lyrically, and a superb, swirling arrangement.  Bowie also manages to paint himself as a disaffected and bitter romantic (ballad \\"Letter to Hermoine\\", which finds the singer at his most pained), shamleessly in love (\\"Janine\\") and a shoplifting sympathizer (the lyrically intriguing \\"God Knows I'm Good\\").  He also makes his first stab at extended development in \\"Cygnet Committee\\", which while it doesn't hang together as well as you'd like, does provide the framework for the likes of \\"Ziggy Stardust\\". <br /> <br />The biggest problem with \\"Space Oddity\\" though is that it's fairly unbalanced, for every memorable cut like \\"Letter to Hermione\\" there's an unmemorable one (\\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\\"), and for every successful melodrama (\\"Space Oddity\\") there's one that's closer to b-grade smarmy psycheledia (\\"Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud\\").  This is all capped off with a nice but poorly arranged \\"Hey Jude\\"-esque closer (the extended \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\"). <br /> <br />Still, from both a historical and a listening perspective, \\"Space Oddity\\" proves to be more good than not, and is a worthwhile purchase.  Bowie would reach higher heights in the future, but \\"Space Oddity\\" is a decent listen.
B000002UWE|4.0|If you only remember Talk Talk from their MTV success days, you will be surprised by the range and depth of this record.  I love \\"Today\\" and \\"It's My Life,\\" they were great 80's synth-pop-dance tracks, the latter of course recently remade by No Doubt.  The first half of this disc contains the more easily accessible material from the early albums, but from the very beginning one can see Talk Talk eager to break out of the synth-pop mold.  As Talk Talk matured, their records became less pop-oriented, more textured and nuanced.  There is a lot of great music here, none of it fitting into any preconceived mold of what pop music is supposed to be.  Highly recommended
1400032717|3.0|This book is wonderfully written and kept my interest; however, I really didn't like the use of the Lord's name in vain so frequently.

B000AA4M9U|3.0|B.B . King can pretty much do whatever he wants at this point; he really has nothing left to prove. The fact that this CD can still reach for some higher level with the obligatory guest star packaging is a feat in itself. While I feel some of the choices here lack inspiration, (Clapton or not, do we need another version of \\"The Thrill is Gone?\\")there are a few cuts that stand out and they are worth a listen. <br />Van Morrison hits all the right notes with B.B. on the traditional \\"Early in the Morning\\" as does Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland on Willie Nelson's \\"Time Slips Away.\\" These two songs are fine examples of two old pros trading lyrics and comments in a loose unscripted fashion.  <br />Mark Knopfler lets loose with some fine guitar of his own \\"All Over Again\\" with some of B.B.'s most inspired vocals and Roger Daltrey makes you want to here him sing more blues. <br />I don't think blues when I think Gloria estefan, Sheryl Crow or Glenn Frey, but nobody really does a bad job; just a collection of forgettable ones. <br />The bottom line is that at 80 who else can maintain this level...I can't think of anyone other than B.B. King.
B00001OH7O|5.0|\\"Hunky Dory\\" is the album where it really came together for David Bowie.  Having tried his hand at psychedelic folk and bizarre proto-metal, Bowie found a way to put all these pieces together, backed by the soon-to-be-Spiders from Mars (guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey) with keyboardist Rick Wakeman along.  Thet album is a curious mix of folky whimsy, distorted guitar leads, and pop genius. <br /> <br />One thing that's certain is that the album is a lot more relaxed then its predecessor (\\"The Man Who Sold the World\\"), from the opening strains of piano-driven \\"Changes\\", it's clear this is something entirely different then the last record.  But one thing that's consistent is enormously high quality of song writing, whether it is balladry (\\"Life on Mars?\\", one of Bowie's early greats), folkish (the lyrically brilliant \\"Quicksand\\") or proto-punk (Velvet Underground-inspired \\"Queen Bitch\\").  Along the way, tributes to Andy Warhol (\\"Andy Warhol\\"), Bob Dylan (\\"Song for Bob Dylan\\") and raising children (\\"Kooks\\") provide a stunning sense of diversity, mood and playfulness to the material. <br /> <br />Bottom line-- this album is pretty much essential listening.  Fantastic from start to finish.  Highly recommended.

Would it not be nice if there was a study of these places to determine why?  Well here it is and it is just like the title says: \\"The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted\\".

B000AL730O|3.0|When I first heard \\"Fine Line\\" I had the feeling after years of mediocre work, McCartney was back on track. The beautiful \\"Jenny Wren\\" sealed the deal and I bought this one. The problem for me was that other than the deliberately \\"Twee\\" \\"English Tea,\\" nothing else on the CD lives up to these songs. There are pretty melodies here, but I am hard pressed to remember any of them despite repeated listenings. I am once again disappointed but the good songs here stand up with some of his better material so I'll embrace those songs and hope for the best in the future.
006054094X|5.0|The preponderance of factual data and superb research forms the glue that holds this spellbinding novelette of the Chinese as the true discoverers of the Americas and most of the world.  Gavin Menzies spirited and no-nonsense approach to this work is both captivating and educational.  I share some of Mr. Menzies' background in navigation with my own schooling and duty as a Quartermaster in the U.S. Navy giving me more insight into his conclusions and prognostications making his book all the more real and believable.<br /><br />I first became aware of Mr. Menzies' and his revelations of the great Ming Dynasty of the 15th century via a local PBS broadcast in 2004 of the National Geographic's production about the achievements of Admiral Zheng He and his huge \\"Treasure Fleets.\\"  The N.G. special was well balanced citing criticisms of Mr. Menzies work by numerous world authorities in ancient times.  However, it was clear that Mr. Menzies work prevailed and more evidence surfaces daily on his web site [...] My daughter, a senior at the University of Southern California was already aware of Menzies' work as it was required reading. History, as we've known it, is hereby put on notice. An excellent publication which has motivated me to purchase a good number of Mr. Menzies' book for my friends.

If everyone in America approached this book with an open mind and read it, the sountry's health crisis would be over.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|Cash's work here is brilliant. His voice now ragged and raw is the perfect instrument to convey the pure emotional impact of Cash's interpretations of these works. Rubin's spare production on these AMERICAN RECORDINGS has been inspired; he has created a perfect environment for Cash, allowing Cash the perfect setting for these last works, filled with fire and emotion. There are a number of outstanding choices here, from a \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" that in Cash's hands becomes a promise of help, to \\"Hurt\\" with a different pain on display than the one Reznor originally supplied; a pain that only a full life filled with an understanding of regret can convey. There are so many highlights here from his angry killer spitting at life in \\"Sam Hill\\" to his reading of \\"Personal Jesus\\" with an honesty that contradicts any sense of irony that might be present in the original. Few artists have finished there careers with an epic work, (Zevon comes to mind)and Cash joins that chosen few. All the AMERICAN RECODINGS are worthwhile additions to your collection, but if I was going to pick one, this would be it.

B000002VCB|5.0|I have been a fan of Alan parsons since I was a kid (now 22 years old) I find it fascinating to read reviews on all Alan parsons works. The thing that is interesting to me is that one review will rate EVE as a great album and rate Time Machine as one of their worst albums. This is interesting to me because I consider Time Machine to be another one of my favorite albums. Furthermore the songs on the album that a reviewer likes are totally different than the one I consider the best.  <br /> <br />So what my point? <br />Alan Parson is a unique band that can offer everyone with some thing to appreciate. That is quite an accomplishment considering some of the bands out there today. Just my two cents.   <br />

B000E1YVZU|5.0|There's been a lot already said in the reviews here, so I won't go into most things. Just a few things that I want to mention. I was hoping that when they finally released this show, it would be a film of the stage production. When I found out it was to be a movie, my first reaction was disappointment. But now that I've seen it, I am very pleased. The loft set is so close to the stage set that you almost feel like you are in the theatre. And I saw the whole original cast at the Nederlander in NYC one week after they won the Tony for best musical (highlight of my life!). Daphne Rubin Vega is missed here - her rendition of Without You was, to me, stronger than Dawson's. But Dawson is still good. Another of my favorite musicals is The Producers, and I was quite disappointed with the film adaptation of that one. All the acting felt pushed and over the top. Not so with Rent. You can feel the connection that these cast members have with each other after years of doing the show together. Very powerful performances. Of course, I did have to laugh at the 'resurrection' of Mimi! One minute, she appears to have died, and 30 seconds later, she is sitting up and going on like nothing happened! And the Director and Cast commentary is very informative and entertaining.
0375501851|2.0|White Teeth is the kind of novel you wish you would rather have read in a condensed Reader's Digest version. It is a grossly overwritten rambling piece of work. Towards the end you begin to suspect that it is not only you the reader who is growing increasingly weary but maybe the writer herself, having worn herself out and wishing to put this \\"great\\" endeavor behind her, suddenly, anti-climatically brings the story to a feeble dead end marked by a cheesy bollywood style re-entrant coincidence. For the poor reader who has patiently endured and is looking for at least some pitiful resolution this can only seem like a major cop out by the writer.  <br /> The ending is only a minor point of annoyance. Zadie Smith is actually a talented writer. Unfortunately she appears to be far too much is awe of her own sense of endless wit. This gets in the way of her writing. It also squeezes all her characters into comic book style stick figures. The novel is not so much a story as a long drawn out situation where each character having started promisingly gets stuck in endless repetitions.  <br /> A reader of Indian origin may find the novel jarring. There is a weird and incongruent evocation of a little remembered nineteenth century historical figure Mangal Pandey who becomes a long running tiresome joke in the novel. Zadie Smith mixes up her geography of the Indian subcontinent quite a bit so that Dacca and Delhi become interchangeable cities. She is ambitious to attempt to inhabit the mind of a middle aged male South Asian immigrant in London. This leads to moments of exaggerated convolutions: the superhuman energetic masturbatory spree of Samad Iqbal, a man supposedly in his fifties would make many a male reader cringe not so much in awe as in disbelief. The cliched and stale bar room conversations of Samad and Archie bring forth a bemused embarrassment. Clearly Zadie Smith has spent little time in the pubs of London. <br /> One can do better than this hackneyed version of theimmigrant experience. For those of you who may have inexplicably enjoyed this book, may I direct you to superior sources of enjoyment for this kind of story: the brilliant small budget British films from the 80's and 90's: <br />My Beautiful Laundrette  <br />My son the Fanatic <br />East is East <br /> <br />And for those who have the taste for Salman Rushdie's style of writing, he remains the grandmaster of this sort of fiction. Zadie Smith is an inadequate pupil of Rushdie.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|Let me first say that I love the original version and I'm so glad that I finally have it on DVD.  The extended version didn't need to be extended as long as it was.  It took a great movie, filled in a few missing scenes and then made it boring.  I now enjoy watching the first 20 to 30 minutes of the extended and then switch over to the original.  The additional intro seems cheesy but it is good.  You have to remember what year the movie was made and what special effects were in use at the time.
0743454537|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.

B000092T6M|4.0|Briefly,  this is still a great movie.  The problems come in the added (formerly deleted) scenes.  A character has his tongue cut out in a deleted scene and later in the movie can talk (in a non-deleted scene).  Just little things like that that some of us find annoying, but not enough to not want to watch the movie.  You need to make your own call on that.
B000AP04NI|1.0|I'm shocked - when I heard the fantastic Todd-AO print was being released, I expected a stunning DVD.  As many others have noted, it is UNWATCHABLE!  One of the worst transfers since DVDs were created. <br /> <br />The Cinemascope version may be considered watchable by some, but it is nothing to crow about.  It is just barely acceptable, and I gave the DVD away I was so disappointed. <br /> <br />With Warner Home Video coming out with increasingly gorgeous transfers, and with people buying high-def TVs that magnify all the flaw of bad transfers, Fox had better get its act together! <br /> <br />What a waste of money...

This book amplified the pain and the suffering these kids had to face.It showed how hard it was for them to get a piece of bread. It focused on the mother's struggle and the father's carelessness, for the mother worked hard to feed her kids while the father got drunk and wasted the money.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I can't even say that I was disappointed. That would insinuate some great expectation from the film in the first place. It is nearly impossible to convey this Jane Austin novel within two hours. Plus, going up against the predecessor, A&E version, with Colin Firth and Jennifer Eyle, is suicide. Given the perameters that Keira Knightly had to work within, her performance was marginal at best that only reflected a marginal interpretation on the writer's part.  <br /> <br />For those who have read the novel or seen any of the preceeding renditions you will know that the Bennett's were not poor in the sense that they lived on a filthy farm and had not a pot to piss in. The Bennett's were lacking in wealth due to having so many daughters,but they were by no means destitute. The writer of this version makes the Bennetts out to be filthy poor by making the family have greasy hair and tatered clothes. The writer again gave no regards to the relationship between each of the family members. How witty Elizabeth was or how much her father doted on her, or how close she was to her older sister, of how the mother favored Lydia most, and how everything vexxed her mother and everything that vexxed her was her husbands fault. Some of the best deliverence comes from the sarcasm that comes from the fathers remarks to the behavior of the younger daughters and that of the mother. These senitments are completely ignored and delivered to the screen, was the exact opposite, a happy loving couple.  <br /> <br />The next issue was the complete lack of sexual tension between Elizabeth and Darsey. Which in turn takes away from the climax of the film, when he asks her to marry him. If you cannot deliver that part of the story, you have no movie to put on screen. <br /> <br />If you want to see a great Jane Austin novel, go to the people that do it the best. Get the A&E version, take an afternoon and get lost in the world of the Bennett's and old society England. Don't waste your time and moneyon a half assed interpretation.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|SERENITY, the movie, has somewhat stronger production values than the TV series and the return of the original TV series cast, but except for SERENITY fanatics, the feature film version will be a disappointment. Even die-hard SERENITY fans should expect something more from a feature film over a TV series but it just isn't there. Yes, there are a couple of slap-face kung fu scenes and breakfast-in-your-throat chase sequences but not enough to overcome the \\"dead\\" spaces where nothing seems to be happening except yak-yak, ho-hum Serenity crew meetings. The cast has visibly aged, which is to be expected, especially Mal and Shepherd. For SERENITY fans, I say, go for it, but for the rest of us, I say, beware: SERENITY, the movie, is not that much better than the TV series, which is saying something about the fine quality of the TV product.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and my parents were so sick of it. they threatened to throw it away.  I recently bought this movie again (still not sure what happened to my first copy?) and I enjoyed this movie just as much as I did as a kid.  My kids sat down and watched it with me.  My 10 year old son thought it was dorky but my 8 year old daughter loved it.  She now asks to watch it all the time and we sing along with the movie together.  If you're looking for a quirky, sometimes creepy but still laughing movie...this is it.
B0009IW88A|5.0|I haven't been really excited about a movie soundtrack since Vangelis' Blade Runner, or Basil Poledouris' Conan the Barbarian. This work is a dark and unique masterpiece that is so good, it doesn't seem to know that it's just a soundtrack. At times it is delicately moving, at times majestically powerful, but always intensely atmospheric and highly emotional.<br /><br />I can't believe some have said this soundtrack doesn't quite measure up to Elfman's work. In my opinion, by way of comparison, Elfman is not fit touch the hem of the garments of Mr.s Zimmer and Howard. Aside from the great theme, Elfman's work was far too comic book-ish and would have been more at home in a cartoon than a motion picture.<br /><br />In any case, even if you have absolutely no interest in the Batman character, or comic book movies in general, if you enjoy baroque orchestral works, you will love this. An absolute must-have.<br /><br />Some good news: Zimmer and Howard are returning to score this film's sequel, The Dark Knight.

Some reviews give the impression that this is not a great performance - \\"Clapton is walking through the performance\\" etc - I can tell you with all sincerity - Cream owes no apologizes here. These are different musicians than when they were in their early careers. If the songs didn't sound different and their playing wasn't different, something would be wrong - they might as well just release the old recordings again. Time has made these three astounding artists even greater. Their performances reflect their beings now - unlike some bands who never let the clock move forward. Jack Bruce no longer \\"spars\\" as much with Clapton and Baker musically - he takes his experiences since Cream and brings that to the way he plays bass in these concerts - more chord work than runs - but full of virtuosity. The threeof them play as a group better than one could possibly imagine after a 30 year break. Three astounding musicians ... great artists make the complex seem simple, and Clapton, Bruce, and Baker do enormously complex things in these performances - astounding.    Don't cheat yourself of majestic performances by mature members of Cream. If you want the old way they used to play, then listen to the old recordings. They will always be there and could never be the same no matter how much we loved those original performances. Let your ears hear THIS performance - not the performances in your head from the past - and you will not only be more than happy but also astounded at the artistry.    Highlights - Sleepy Time, NSU, We're Going Wrong, Politician, Spoonful, Sweetwine - really all the songs are top notch. Great to hear so many songs that were not known as Cream's \\"hits.\\" I would put these musicians up against any half their age. There's so many layers to the way they play. The songs have meanings they never had in the past. The DVD has better sound than the CD as far as I can tell - you can hear all the intricate things that Jack Bruce does on bass better.     This IS a GREAT performance - buy it, crank it up, and enjoy!

B000E6UK5K|3.0|David Gilmour could have done better. <br /> <br />On An Island contains no surprises about Gilmour's playing.  The soaring guitar notes and gentle voice are there.  But the rest of the instruments are bland and uninspiring - there's nothing to support Gilmour's adventuresome solos and phrasing.  The drums put out a simple beat and the keyboards offer standard riffs, so there's no challenge.  Even the lonely sax from the \\"Diamond\\" era songs is there on songs like Red Sky At Night, but we've heard it before. <br /> <br />The music is quite listenable - nothing like the self-indulgence of Atom Heart Mother.  But it's background music, not pay-attention music.  The Zen-like photos in the accompanying lyrics booklet suggest at a depth that just isn't there.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is a good effort with a lot of \\"Floyd\\" feel to it.  Music great lyrics good.  You have to enjoy whatever you can get and this may be it.  To lament about an old subject.  It would be great to see a new \\"Floyd\\" album with all of the parts.  There are alot of great bands that want to play and can't due to death.  Here we have all living and just can't get along.  Just a frustrating situation as a fan.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|The first song I ever heard from Avenged Sevenfold was \\"Unholy Confessions\\" a couple years ago. My first impression was that they were wasting amazing guitar riffs with a terrible singer because at the time I was not a fan of the Metal-esque scream. I have come to enjoy A7X's screaming more, but the reason City of Evil stands out to me so much is that it combines even more amazing guitar riffs with much better vocals. I realize that veteran fans of A7X will be disappointed in this new style, but it is not to be looked at as if A7X is selling out. M. Shadows, the lead singer, had to have surgery on his throat and can no longer scream. I must say he has made great achievements out of what many may consider a harsh turn for M. Shadows.     When I hear a song with a great guitar solo, I will typically buy the CD because I am sure the rest will be good. This is the first time I have ever purchased a CD based on one song and ended up liking every other song on the CD more than that first one. I loved the riffs from 'Betrayed', and decided that it could justify purchasing the rest of the CD. It is still an amazing song, but every other song on the CD is so beautifully orchestrated that and individually crafted that 'Betrayed' becomes easily topped. Individual Reviews are as follows:    Beast and the Harlot: Nice way to start out the CD. Seems as if this song has a happy mood to it until you read the lyrics. Guitar is fantastic, and singing follows in excellence. (10/10)    Burn it Down: Good follow-up to Beast and the Harlot. Somewhat similar in style as a and guitar does not slack. Drums are extremely well-played also. (10/10)    Blinded in Chains: This song has nothing special to it after the song begins, but it is still a tremendous effort on the part of A7X, and it shows even in this less flashy song. (10/10)    Bat Country: As many people have heard this song, I am sure you either love it or hate it. Personally I love it and think it is magnificent. One of the bettersolos on the CD. (10/10)    Trashed & Scattered: The fast pace of this song is great to listen to and The Reverend plays the guitar so perfectly for this pace that I can't help but wondering what kind of sick possession he has. (10/10)    Seize the Day: By far my least favorite song on the CD. Some parts of it are really good though. Also I must include that I am the only person I know who does not like this song. (7/10)    Sidewinder: Best song on the CD. By far. It is the pinnacle of this CD and expresses everything that needs to be said or played. It contains the best solo of any song I have ever heard. The words are meaningful, and the singing is fantastic. Clocking in at just over 7 minutes, this song has moved in to my favorite song of all time. (10/10)    The Wicked End: Song about the end of the world and how wicked our world is. Good riffs, and the solo is quite possibly the sickest, most fast-paced solo you will ever hear. I did not know it was possible for somebody to move their fingers this fast. The bass is also noticeably good in this song as well (10/10)    Strength of the World: Good mix of orchestra and A7X's own special brand. Song about vengeance on behalf of a man's family. Some of the best stuff is in this song. (10/10)    Betrayed: As I said, this is the song that attracted me to this CD, and it is a good one. I cannot remember off the top of my head who it is about, but I believe is a tribute to another musician. Great guitaring and fantastic drumming. (10/10)    M.I.A.: Song about the current War in Iraq. Probably the deepest song as far as lyrics on the CD, and the guitaring should be mentioned because it closes out the CD so perfectly that anything else would be considered half-assed. Fantastic last song to a CD and one of my top 10 favorite songs ever. (10/10)    So total that is a 97/100. It is easy to overlook the minimal shortcomings on this CD, such as 'Seize the Day'. It should also be noted that some may be offended by the language on this CD. Also, while many have called A7X a satanic band, M. Shadows said that he does not promote satan in his life or on this CD, so it is a safe listen for any Christians. I recommend this CD to any normal human being interested in listening to some of the best music ever created.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|As an infantry soldier currently serving in the US Marine Core, I am utterly disgusted by this crappy film which slanders the honorable men and women of my belved Core.  But then again, I don't expect anything more from liberals and the Hollywood crowd, which manage to depict my fellow marines as sex-obsessed, unprofessional soldiers who watch pornographic videos and dance around listening to rap music like a bunch of teenage slackers.  As a marine who has fought for this great country and is currently serving in Iraq and serving this great President, I am ashamed that such a film slanders my prescious Marine Core!  Hooah.
074327931X|3.0|I got this book to get some extra practice on the problems on the test -- particularly Math section.  For a book that differentiates itself with the \\"800\\" moniker, I felt the problems were WAY too easy for this level.  I'd hate to see what the regular book is like.  It didn't even deal with what are considered the hardest problems on the test -- probability and permutations & combinations.  So I'd recommend this book ONLY to people who want some basic extra problems, and forgoe the regular Kaplan books altogether (although I haven't read them, and this book does NOT give any overview of math topics).  You're way better off getting the official guides.
B000089RVX|5.0|A friend of mine said to me yesterday \\"it's amazing how you can take a guy who can't play guitar and a girl who can't sing, put them together and you actually have a band that sounds good\\"...he was refering to Evanescence, and while I will admitt that neither Amy Lee nor the guitarest (god I wish I could remember his name) are the greatest of their profession I will not agree that they are terrible.  The point he was getting at was that theres just somthing about Evanescence that you can't put your finger on that makes you love them.  Even if you think Amy Lee is a terrible singer you still love her music.  He's right because Evanescence have that 'it' quality that makes them irresistable.  With hits like 'GOING UNDER', the over rated 'WAKE ME UP INSIDE' the brilliant 'MY IMMORTAL' and the radio friendly 'EVERYBODY'S FOOL' there are thousands of people who rushed out to but this CD based on radio play alone, but I love about this band is that its the diamond in the rough tracks hidden behind the glossy packaging that really make this CD worth the price sticker.  'HAUNTED' is eerily beautiful and sounds like something off a Stabbing Westward CD...'MY TOURIQUET' is just infectious and 'HELLO' is so beautiful it can bring tears.  'TAKING OVER ME' and 'MY LAST BREATH' have the same vibe to them, they are better versions of 'WAKE ME UP INSIDE' and they showcase Amy's talent.  'WHISPER' is a brilliant choice for closing track...but heres my problem...the best tracks by Evanescence are not on this album.  'MISSING' was actually the first song I've ever heard by this band, back before 'WAKE ME UP INSIDE' was even released ont he radio and I fell in love with this band.  Now you can get this track on their 'ANYWHERE BUT HOME' CD but it should have been here.  Hopefully they will release a new CD soon, and hopefully it will live up to the potential they proved they have with this exceptional debut!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job in this film and to give the Oscar to a background character actor is a shame.  How many actors recorded an album as well as acted in the movie.  Why does Jaime Fox win and Joaquin does not?  You have a two time nominated Actor for Gladiator and now Walk the line.  What a joke.  Truman Capote? Who was he and why do we care? Let see if Truman can sing and act. Maybe the Academy will pick another movie such as the Woody Allen story and pick a miserable little troll like him -vs.- the story of say...an 11 time Grammy winner who was given accolades from President Bush and loved by millions of fans in his 40 year career.
B00003CWN2|5.0|Even when a \\"girl\\" suffers from sexual identity crisis and decides to change its gender, she would rarely if ever adopt the cruel \\"boy code\\" or place herself into the \\"gender straightjacket\\" which would limit her compassion and kindness (terms used and described in details by the author of the \\"Real Boys\\") <br /> <br />Yes, Brandon tried to act like a \\"bad boy\\" by stealing, cheating, lying etc... Yes, Brandon tried to show some macho characteristics when she rode the truck or engaged in the fight. Brandon is definitely more courageous than many boys would be when she comes out the hiding in the last scene to defend her host from the vicious attack.  <br /> <br />However Brandon in contrast to her male \\"friends\\" maintains sane limits in what she is willing to do to prove her masculinity. For example she would not keep on moving away from police in spite of great danger of crash (she'd already drove much too recklessly than she would ever felt comfortable with, under the pressure of her macho-crazy \\"friends\\" ) .In another scene she would rather admit that she's a \\"wuss\\" than mutilate her with the knife to prove her \\"machismo\\". <br /> <br />In short, despite many \\"bad boy\\" characteristics that Brandon incorporates, she's at heart a \\"good\\", \\"caring\\" \\"gentle\\" boy-girl who is not afraid to cry.  She's tragically raped and killed by the men who felt their \\"male honor\\" insulted.  While her killers might had been born psychopaths, the society is in part to blame for sanctioning \\"macho boys\\" and shaming \\"boys who cry\\". <br />
B000002J1O|5.0|This album is Genesis at its roots. The band with Peter Gabriel is the true Genesis, after Gabriel forget it. Songs like the Battle of Epping Forest show the path of this band and the core of its music. I heard this album my freshman year in college\\"74\\" and to this day it still stands as a remarkable debut to \\"The Lamb lies down\\". The dialog and instrumentation is un-matched - Genesis at its Best is what this album brings.   Selling England is a must in any rock collection.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out. (I'm buying the DVD today)I was living in Pensacola at the time (BIG USN and USMC city)and I saw it with my girlfriends.  The biggest mistake one can make in going to view this movie is that it's a war movie.  <br />There won't be any long battle scenes (think Black Hawk Down, Independence Day, or Saving Private Ryan, etc). The climax of the movie is subtle but it's there. If one sits down to watch Jarhead and wait and wait and wait for the big Hollywood war scene, they will be disapointed.  It's kind of like watching the Lord of the Rings expecting everything to be resolved at the end of the first movie. <br />You will enjoy the adult humor and feel emotion during Swof's long desert deployment and perhaps even learn a few new words and their definitions (Jody, anyone?) <br />Those serving in the military and those that have loved ones that are or have been deployed, (like myself) will understand the meanings and know what the characters in this movie go through. <br />I recommend it to everyone, at least rent it before making that big commitment to purchase it. <br />Thanks. <br />Semper Fi
6305511055|5.0|This is one of Robert Redford's best suspense films.  Paired with Faye Dunaway and Cliff Robertson, this film about intrigue in the intelligence community was a forerunner to today's \\"24.\\"  Highly recommended.
B000001DTM|5.0|Just sampled a sold-out Coldplay concert here in Dallas, Texas, and must say I was reasonably rewarded, they are a talented band..However, they are not U2 and never will be, though they've obviously hijacked/borrowed much U2 schtick..My mind wandered randomly at times during the Coldplay concert thinking, shoot, a month ago I could have seen the \\"real thing\\", U2 had just toured Dallas..\\"Achtung Baby\\" is my favorite U2 CD, it's an edgy masterpiece..I think Bono and the boys were inspired and influenced by time spent in cabarets in Berlin, Germany, the same way the Beatles were in merchant-marine basement bars in Hamburg..And this album has a Germanic militant sense of urgency to it, sadly lacking in more recent, more celebrated U2 releases..\\"You're so cruel\\" proves how relevant Bono is as troubador-poet..In most instances, his lyrics are as penetrating as Jim Morrison's are/were, the front-man for the \\"Doors\\"..God bless the Irish, they do have 8 cylinder hearts..On the David Letterman Show, Dave asked Bono to articulate the essential differences between an Englishman and an Irishman..Bono spoke, tongue firmly in cheek, \\"When an Englishman sees a mansion on a hill he says, someday I'm going to get me a mansion...But when an Irishman sees a mansion on a hill, he says someday I'm going to get the \\"S.O.B.\\" that lives in that mansion\\"..The difference between Coldplay and U2..Achtung Baby!
B00004YKSD|5.0|Since it's Oliver Stone, you know going in that not everything is is going to be accurate. And as long as you keep that in mind and don't take the script as biography, you'll have quite the good time with this recreation of the career of Jim Morrison. It's all suitably sensationalistic, with Jim and Pamela dropping acid at every possible opportunity, and with Jim dropping trou at every other opportunity.  <br /> <br />Many of Jim's girlfriends were combined to form the character here called Patricia Keneally-Morrison (a real-life hookup), to occasionally laughable effect, such as when Patricia, anguished to discover that Jim didn't take their witch wedding seriously, cries out, \\"Those vows were forever in the sight of the Goddess!\\" However laughable the composite character is, the real-life Patricia Keneally-Morrison is even more so, as you'll discover when viewing the Special Features disc, on which she tells the camera with an air that will make you cringe that the reason the movie took so long to get made was because she put a hex on it. (Patty baby, it's girls like you that make it impossible for people to take Wiccans seriously.) <br /> <br />For his part, Val Kilmer does a pitch-perfect job of playing Jim--literally. That sexy voice you hear coming out of Val's mouth during band scenes? That's Val. Hearing him you'll wonder why on earth Val hasn't recorded an album, because that voice is deadly good.  <br /> <br />My only real complaint about this film goes back to that cautionary note about this film's not being all accurate. Frankly, the movie makes Jim look like a jerk, which he wasn't--not all the time. According to John Densmore's autobiography, Riders on the Storm, Jim could be charming, a real Southern gentleman. It's fun to watch the crazy ride, but you can't help but wish the movie gave you a chance to cuddle with Jim, too.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Alright, so where do I begin?  Well, overall I thought this was a great movie which followed along with Austen's story quite well (in light of the time constraints which movies must adhere to).  I loved all the characters- each was true to the nature that Austen intended them for.  I thought the chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy was great, just enough romance but not too overpowering.  Clearly the people that made this movie read the story.  I only wish that the story continued on, alas Austen never wrote the sequel so I am kinda glad a second movie hasn't been made (it just wouldn't be the same).  I only gave this four stars because something was wanting, I just can't put my hand on what (possibly the ending scene- could have been better).  Anyhow, if you loved the book let me assure you, you'll like the movie, if not love it (I watched in three times the day it came out)!
0440237688|5.0|In my opinion The Giver by Lois Lowry is an amazing book.  It has a fantastic plot line and characters that the reader loves.  Not only does this book bring up several things that are problems in society, but it also make you think about your world and what life would be like with or without certain things or things.  Jonas and Gabriel are two of the most lovable characters and every reader is sure to fall in love with them.  This book is one of those books that can be read over and over again and each time the reader can get something new and different out of it.  Lastly, The Giver is also a book that can be read at almost any age and if you read it more than once at different ages you will view the book differently.          <br /> <br />K.M. <br />GHS
B000E6UK5K|4.0|If you're a fan of David Gilmour's voice and guitar playing, particularly of the Meddle.Ummagumma period, this album will fit you like a comfortable old shoe or a pair of sweatpants on a lazy Sunday morning. There's no edge to this, nothing shocking, nothing rocking. Its a pleasant, proper and classy recording and its entirely fitting for a legend who turned 60 years old. Its meant for an older, mellower audience, I think...perhaps the 40 and up crowd...people who probably still remember what original songs were and what recordings were like when people actually played instruments on them. Simply put, this is the new old fogey music, and guess what....if you like it, you're probably one of em. (I am.)

B00004WLXZ|5.0|I saw the movie before I read Riefenstahls autobiography. When I watched the movie, I was sure it had been staged. Nothing could be THAT perfect just filmed during events.<br /><br />Then I read Riefenstahl's autobiography and was awed. She describes in detail what she experienced and endured to make this film. Nothing was staged. Her enemies tried to prevent her from making it, but she persevered. It is a superb documentary of a very anguished time in world history.
B000AGTPUA|3.0|Santa Claus is a tough sell. You can't cause him too much peril, because, ... well, because he's Santa Claus. In \\"The Polar Express\\", the only conflict that exits is the threat of losing your belief, in Santa Claus. Adults may add their own metaphor. No evil plot to conquer The North Pole, no reindeer catastrophe, no elves picketing for better working conditions, no, this is serious Santa. What we all understand about the famous, \\"Yes, Virginia, There Is A Santa Claus\\", newspaper editorial, (it's always been my cynical belief that a brilliant editor made up the letter), is laid out here in bloated bubble-gum fashion. Somehow wallowed in the sentiments and styles of the first half of the 20th Century, the film is about a magical train to The North Pole, and if nothing else, they got the transport right, sometimes the train ride to Santa Land is as redundant as a train ride to Buffalo.<br /><br />\\"The Polar Express\\" is filmed with animated real actors, apparently playing opposite a 'blue screen', and then swallowed up by it, like that dreadful Aha! video from decades ago, and the effect is like a more mature, thoughtful Gumby, or a decrepit Davy and Goliath, (it was a clay-motion religious children's show in the early '60's, and those who have seen it will never be the same.) Great care is given to detail the facial psychological grimaces of the boy who hops aboard The Polar Express, to see for himself if Santa is real, but the 'extra' kids on the train, seem ridiculously unable to react or interplay with the few speaking characters with dialogue, like if they spoke, the producers would have to pay them imaginary scale, or the animators would have to move their mouths. When a magical train ticket, (nothing is left un-magic-ized), is lost out the window of the train to the wind, the film uses exquisite filming technique to record its journey up mountains, down rivers, free-falling and swirling in snow squalls, and it is a very nice, worthless to the story, bit of Fantasia. Likewise, the boxcar tramp who appears to the boy in times of peril, like a cowboy from heaven, is a nice touch, but the idea, like the tramp, disappears in a puff of smoke.<br /><br />The final North Pole Christmas climax extravaganza, looked to me, given its 1940's heart, like a horrific German youth for Hitler rally, with thousands of elves dominating the city, (mean mothers, too), like a Karl Marx industrial nightmare, and what seemed an entire civilization vowing allegiance to dictator Santa.<br /><br />Suffice to say, \\"The Polar Express\\" doesn't compare to the humblest Christmas pageants, say, TV's \\"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\\", which seems to have the same earnest warm Christmas thoughts in mind, and accomplishes the sentiment that The Polar Express, all lights flashing, and whistles blowing, roars through. Will kids like this movie? I think they will. Will they hold it precious through their lives? There's the rub.ntasia.

B00009V7T2|4.0|These guys are very good, no doubt about it.  The songs are constantly teetering on the brink of chaos, and it's stunning how well the music is controlled.  The lyrics do the same, obscure to the point of inscrutability, but somehow packing a hefty emotional punch in spite of it.  Unfortunately, there are times when even the formidable chops of the band can't keep it together and the whole thing takes a nosedive from genius to mediocre.  None of the album is genuinely bad, but some of it is less than stellar. <br /> <br />Regardless, no one sounds like the Mars Volta, not even its predecessor, At the Drive-In, making this is a must-buy for any rock fan.  You may not like it, but you'll be the better for listening to it.
B0006L16N8|4.0|This CD has some amazing songs like \\"A Message\\", \\"Fix You', and the somewhat hidden track \\"Till Kingdom Come\\" but it isn't as complete of an album as Rush of Blood to the Head.  There are some average songs in between the great ones.  And when I say average, I mean average for Coldplay but otherwise still good songs.  I expected a lot from these guys after ROBTTH and they almost pulled it off.  Still looking forward to hearing them perform it live.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This is my first Sigur Ros album, and I was very surprised at how easy it is to listen to.  Don't get me wrong, this is not radio-friendly (and thank goodness for it) but it's not Einsturzende Neubauten, either.  The music is beautiful, not unpleasant, but still complex and intriguing, like a symphony one of the old masters might have written if he'd had access to electric guitars, synthesizers, and a stash of recreational drugs.  :) <br /> <br />In most reviews, I'd leave it at that, but I have to comment on the packaging.  This is far and away the most beautiful album I've ever seen.  It's as much a work of art as the music, and it's practically worth the price of admission for the cover-art alone.  Do yourself a favor and buy this one new and unsullied (sorry, sellers).

B000HBK3MM|4.0|I ain't gonna front. I've been looking forward to this CD since I heard that beautiful slice of soul drenched honey-of-a-single' like a Star'. Yes there has been a lot of hype surrounding this young lady, based on this one toon. Well, I'm here to say that you need to believe the hype on this one. Listening to this CD conjures up images of lazy warm summer days, chillin with a loved one, or outside listening on your MP3 player.<br /><br />Firstly, let's deal with the voice. She has been compared to Billie Holiday, which is high praise indeed. I'll leave the comparisons up to you. I'll stick to the music.<br /><br />The aforementioned `Like a star' kicks off this CD, and is quickly followed by `Enchancement', which is dream-like lullaby of a love song, beautifully sang. The second single' Put your records on', is a feel-good uplifting summer song, with a great video (see on Corinnebaileyrae.net) `Till it happens to you' slows downs proceedings, with a blues rinsed song of heart break. Things perk up with' Trouble sleeping, a mid tempo offering, which is light and breezy. 'Call me when you get this' is one of my favourite tunes on the CD. With strings and an old school feel running all through it, I hope this is a single release. Beautiful. Things are laid bare, on the Piano led 'choux pastry heart' which highlights Corinne's vocal strength, and range. 'Breathless' is another highlight, a sweet song of the first fruits of love. 'Butterfly' is another gorgeous. mid-tempo, song relating to Corinne's relationship, with her mother. The album ends with,' Season change, another favourite, which deal with life's pain, hurts, and disappointments. All these songs are slow to mid tempo, so for those looking for the latest `club' banger, may be disappointed. This is the kind of CD that you can let play without skipping songs, and it's a grower. All these songs didn't hit me immediately, but the warmth quickly spread.  On a side note, the single' Put your records on' has a bonus song' Since I've been loving you', an old Led Zepalin tune,  which is available on Itunes. Piano driven slice of soul. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.e I've been loving you', an old Led Zepalin tune,  which is available on Itunes. Piano driven slice of soul. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.   <br /> <br />

B000BYA5GO|2.0|Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) finds himself face to face with his worst enemy, tied to a chair. A Liberian dictator gleefully hands Yuri a gun and tells him to fire away, but Yuri is terrified. The dictator takes Yuri's hands as if he were helping a child and helps him fire, blowing the other man's brains out. Yuri may have sold millions of weapons to people all over the world, but he has never fired a single shot. <br /> <br />This was Lord of War's best scene, a glaring standout in a film soaked with mediocre, gloomy cynicism. Writer/Director Andrew Niccol desperately wants to say something about the arms trade that gives people in third-world countries the means to butcher each other, but his obvious lack of answers infects the entire screenplay. By the end, Niccol's desperation is palatable as the final ten minutes spirals into an entirely different message than the 110 that preceded it.  <br /> <br />Growing up a Ukrainian immigrant in New York, Yuri works at his father's restaurant. After witnessing a gang shooting, he realizes that he should sell something that everyone needs other than food. He works his way from selling Uzi's to thugs to bringing shiploads of AK-47's to dictators. Though a relentless Interpool agent (Ethan Hawke, playing self as a nave doofus) hounds him at times, Yuri finds the arms trade to be eerily lucrative. <br />  <br />An atheist-existentialist, Yuri never so much as shrugs at the suggestion that his actions are wrong. He hurls heavy handed lines like \\"You know who's going to inherit the world? Arms dealers. Because everyone else is too busy killing each other,\\" every thirty seconds or so, in case we forget that he possesses a cynical world-view. He traipses around the world, narrating in monotone about how much profitable arms sales are, people killing each other, not caring, etc.  <br /> <br />Nearly every line and character exists solely for the purpose of illustrating a message Niccol isn't even certain of. Never does the film makea serious attempt at balancing the gloom and doom. Yuri's trophy wife lives the high life off his blood money, then dubiously insists he quit. Yuri brings coke-head brother (Jared Leto) along for no reason other than that the screenplay needs a martyr. And in case we didn't think Yuri was bad enough, the vicious Liberian murders his underlings on a whim. There have been Bond films with more layered characters, and I've seen a few with Roger Moore. <br /> <br />Lord of War gets a few shots into the 10-ring with some black humor and appropriately grim photography, but results in a total misfire. Someone should send Andrew Niccol a memo explaining that relentless cynicism unopposed results in mere whining; Lord of War whines so loud it could be heard over a volley of the machine guns Yuri uses to pay for his limo. <br /> <br />
0316172324|3.0|I was really excited to read this, but I thought it was just okay. He kept repeating the same idea over and over. It was one idea stretched ad infinitum. I don't regret having read it, but I still don't think it's brillian by any means.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|\\"On An Island\\" has the wonderful feel of some of the post Syd Barrett, Pre-Dark Side of the Moon Pink Floyd Albums.  It's filled with that lazy afternoon, half asleep, half in love, happiness.  It's got some of the warmest, gentlest, guitar playing by David Gilmore since Meddle/Obscured by the Clouds/More.    As much as I've loved all his work over the years, I've really missed the kind of stuff he does on this album.  Which is not to say David doesn't play some serious, ear tickling, testosterone raging, Floyd solo guitar, here.  The opening track is so magnificent, so \\"100% essence of Floyd,\\" it has me grinning like a Cheshire cat whenever I play it.  It's the kind of opening that makes you scratch your head with wonderment at Roger Waters, for having thought that he could ever make transcendent solo albums and carry on without David Gilmour.  (I think the fact that Roger wrote the best lyrics on all their albums, made him so cocky and confident that he thought he could make the kind of unbelievably lovely music the Floyd did, as well..  Boy, was he ever wrong.  Gilmour is the most important ingredient to that space wall of sound they have.)  In any case, track 1, Castellorizon, is absolutely perfect.  It stands with the best of anything on any Floyd album.  Tracks 2 and 3 are really nice.  I get the same feeling listening to them that I get when I think of \\"Stay\\" by Richard Wright or the side of the Echoes album that has the single songs.  They emote a really good, relaxed feeling.  The CD takes a dive with track number 4.  It's a psychologically sick track-that baffles me a bit.  Who let this piece of weirdness slip onto the CD?  The lyrics include the lines, \\"When you're down is where you find yourself.  When you drown there's nothing else.\\"  It's a celebration of depression.  What's up with that?  Or, \\"I never got to you by being kind.  If I'm the one to throw you overboard, at least I showed you how to swim for shore.\\"  This song is beyond odd.  It goes to show that being rich and famous and old doesn't mean you can't write completely stupid lyrics at times.  A person who has \\"found\\" him/herself is a person who gets up in the morning, goes outside, and feels supreme happiness, not because its payday, or new love, or any other reason than the fact that they are simply happy most of the time.  Depressed people are not enlightened people.  There's also something suspect about a relationship where, \\"I never got to you by being kind\\" is the modus operandi.  (Get out the whip, baby?)   Tracks 4-6 aren't that good and can't manage to pull the listener out of the hole track 3, \\"Take A Breath\\" shoves a listener down.  Track 7 is the next too-too wonderful thing on the album, after the opening.  It's this quiet Gilmore guitar instrumental that is supremely old-Floyd pleasant.  It's the quite happiness one feels sitting in a warm bath, alone, reading a good book, and then getting up and going for a bike ride through the woods.  It's almost too much happiness.  Track 8, Smile, is a soft masterpiece-my favorite thing besides the opening.  It's so good, that Dave should have stuck an instrumental after it, instead of track 9, \\"a pocketful of stones,\\" which has an orchestra-and which I'm still not sure I like or dislike.  The CD ends beautifully, with a completely solo track called, \\"Where we start.\\"  It's the only David Gilmore song on here that he sings on, that isn't co written by his wife.  As much as I like some of the songs he writes with his wife, I really enjoy hearing a song just by him.  I sometimes get tired of the John and Yoko and Paul and Linda and Johnny and June-kind of thing.  The following will sound a bit absurd but I think a lot of fans feel this way: but when you grow up listening to some rock n roll dude/god--to some degree they are your best friend when you are lying on a couch with your headphones on (a complete myth of course).  But then later, when they marry and their wives start showing up all over the music, the wives can interfere with that direct experience.  I mean like with John and Yoko.  For years one listened to songs by John and you grew with him and suddenly, you get this Yoko filter between you and John's psyche, and it can be slightly annoying.  And you get this strong feminine element in the music that wouldn't otherwise be there-and you're not used to.  (There's occasional juxtapositions of Floyd guitar with some lyrics on this CD that are as jarring as would be hearing Led Zeppelin in their prime doing a Carpenters song.)  It's like sometimes you just want to hear and talk to your pal, and not have to sit there with their wife in the room.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I love some of the Gilmour/Sampson songs.  Smile is astonishingly good.  But I think this album has a bit too much of it.  I wish Gilmour had nixed some of her songs and stuck them on a Sampson solo album, which he produced.  And in their place (tracks 4, 5, 6, and 9), there should have been some Roger Water, Richard Wright and Mason songs or collaborations.  This thing should have been a Pink Floyd album.  Definitely.  Roger Waters has said he's working on an album of love songs.  Wouldn't a few of them have been perfect on this album?  Richard Wright has written some brilliant pieces that would have worked here.  I really missed hearing Wright's keyboards on the last song, \\"Where We Start.\\"  It's a really, really good song that would have been even better.  (What's sometimes eerie on this disc is that the drumming sounds exactly like Nick Mason's, even though it isn't.)  I have a feeling that when Richard Wright, Roger Waters, and Nick Mason finally give a good listen to this album, that their reaction will be one of a great opportunity missed.  Oh the things they could have done with some of David's riffs and songs.  The individual members of Pink Floyd are like the Beatles.  They were much, much better when they were all together.  I wish they'd gotten together on this one.  David Gilmour is in top form.  He needs a little bit of Roger and the rest though--and god only knows, Roger needs David.   Roger has said he thinks he has one more great album in him.  Let's only hope he brings his songs round to David, when he thinks he's written it.   By the way, who is the idiot who put together the booklet on this thing?  All verbiage should be readable.  There are several pages where the titles of the song are printed in dark red lettering set against a black background.  There's no excuse for this kind of thing.  I can tell you that there are going to be literally tens of thousands of 40+ fans who are going to be squinting, uncomfortably, with their aging eyes--trying to read the nearly-unreadable titles.  It may look hip, but Art be damned.  Print stuff so it's readable!!!  If I want to squint at faint Egyptian hieroglyphics I'll pick up one of my illustrated history books!

0307276902|5.0|I must admit that the hoopla surrounding this book caught my interest and made me buy and read it.  I had heard all the rumors, all the \\"misinformation\\", and the truth behind Frey's stint in rehab, but I went into the book with an open mind.  If nothing else, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  I found myself completely wrapped up in the book and its chilling account of life in a rehabilitation center.  I could not put it down.  With every turn of the page, I was more and more enthralled and simply had to know what came next.   <br />I believe that whether or not the majority of the book is true, false, or a combination of the two, it is a good read and worth your time.  (It may not take as long as you think a 400+ page book might since it is so easy to read.) It is well-written, either as fiction or memoir.  The dialogue presents scenes in an unfamiliar yet intriguing way.  With no separation of paragraphs and no quotations around the dialogue, readers will find themselves caught up in the moment and unable to stop reading.   <br /> Be forewarned though, the language is graphic and the images are disturbing.  Frey is able to capture the pain and fear he feels in such a way that even the \\"cleanest\\" readers can somehow understand what he must have been going through.   <br />This is a story of bringing oneself up from the deepest and darkest of moments, dealing with the obstacles along the way, and learning from mistakes made.  I think that everyone can relate to that aspect-drug user or not.     <br />

B00005A46T|1.0|Well if you closely listen to this album you would notice similarities between Fear Factory and this album. So I knew that Slipknot tried to ripoff Fear Factory and they failed. This album tried hard to become death metal, yet the growling was weak, the drumming made no sense at all, the guitarrist are 3 guys that cant pull a decent chord. Practically all the songs sound nearly the same, the same monotone vocal, guitarring and and the same beat. Hell I criticised this album yet I still like their first and third albums, go figure!
B00003CX95|4.0|A beautiful combination of a love story and a historic war epic. The real charm from this film that gives it character is the intentional lack of dialog. So much of the magic of this film is the things that are said without words. Highly recommended.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|After reading the majority of reviews after the first release day in America (March 7th, 2006), I see that they are pleasantly mixed...and that's good. To put it best, \\"On An Island\\" is the best solo work of David Gilmour...the 60+ Gilmour that is. By no means does this compare to his late 70's/early 80's efforts \\"David Gilmour/About Face\\". For one, each of those albums presented a variety of moods and tempos, ranging from depression to happiness, fast to slow. This one seems to represent only two:Meloncally and Slow Patience. Slow meaning each song seems to be played like on slow, real slow, motion. There's no \\"Blue Light\\", \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\", or \\"No Way\\" on this one. Think more down the lines of \\"Near The End\\"...the album! While that song is one of my Gilmour solo favorites, I didn't really want an entire album dedicated to it.<br /><br />But then again, what did I expect? This actually is a great album under the circumstances, meaning material from a man who admittedly is past his prime. I mean give him credit for still having his voice presented pitch perfect, his guitar playing still as great as ever, and simply being able to do either of those still at 60 on this album in the first place. Anyone who should expect the \\"Dark Side/Wish You Were Here/Wall\\" Dave in 2006 should really wake up now or put the bong away ('cause it ain't happening!).<br /><br />None of us are the same people we were 20 years ago either, and this album is a good, and yes listenable, version of the Man that once was those things. I'm pretty sure if Pink Floyd recorded an album right after \\"Live 8\\", we'd all be posting the exact same reviews, just with different song titles.<br /><br />So sure, it's a little boring at times, but that could also be known as relaxing, and that may of been Dave's point. If you want \\"Dark Side\\", go buy it again for the hundredth time. If you want something partially made by that team, but 35 years older, buy this...and understand what it's true value is.<br /><br />Oh, am I saying buy it or not? Simply put: it's the third solo album, buy it third.alue is. <br /> <br />Oh, am I saying buy it or not? Simply put: it's the third solo album, buy it third.

0805076476|3.0|I'm really torn on this one...  On the one hand, it is a senseless protrayal of all the ills present in young american men in society today.  This book reads more like an adolescent's guide to vandalism and debouchery than a soul searching answer to freedom of the ego. <br /> <br />On the other hand, it can be read deeper as a path to your personal epiphany.

The setting is Dorset.   <br /> <br />A clergyman, Father Baddeley, a friend from Adam's boyhood, (Adam's father had been a canon), dies just before Adam's visit to him at a rest facility.  The head of Toynton Grange is Wilfred Anstey.  The facility specializes in progressive incurable diseases.  The place runs on a shoestring.  Father Baddeley's legacy is a blessing.   <br /> <br />Victor Holroyd, a man of unpleasant temper, dies, too.  Adam has a sense of fore boding since two people have died among a limited number of inhabitants.  Also, someone has written poison pen letters.  The black tower resembles a lighthouse.  Wilfred's great grandfather walled himself up in the tower and starved to death.   <br /> <br />Adam learns that a climbing rope used by Wilfred has been frayed deliberately.  The next significant event is that there is a fire in the black tower.  Wilfred Anstey is removed from the building.  A third person in care at the home dies.  At this point the facility has only four patients and it seems that a decision must be made about the future.  Adam figures out who wrote the letters and confronts the woman.   <br /> <br />A fourth person, Maggie Hewson, is found by Adam hanging in the black tower.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|David Gilmour really deserves credit for his \\"On An Island\\" album, released today.  The man clearly doesn't give a damn about following any trends, and I say more power to him.  The album does indeed sound very Floyd-ish, which Gilmour himself admits, but it's not merely some toothless rehash of past glories, and the production values here are really excellent (the album was produced by Gilmour, Phil Manzanera, and Chris Thomas).  And Gilmour's in excellent voice too, sounding as though he's barely aged a day in the past 20 years.  You needn't have any worries about this being a \\"modernized\\", high-tech disaster--the album sounds more like something that was recorded in 1980 than in the 2000s, and I really mean that as a compliment.      I think it's off the mark and misleading to bluntly say that Gilmour has \\"gone adult contemporary\\" with this album--that might get certain people thinking he's chosen a bland synthesizer-heavy approach.  Quite the contrary, synthesizer is only used for a light sprinkling of effects on the title track, and synths are nowhere to be heard on songs such as \\"The Blue\\" and \\"Where We Start\\"--instead, David favors real piano, real electric piano, and especially real Hammond organ (which all three of these have), and that plays a huge role in them sounding so wonderfully organic.      Yes, this is a VERY low volume album, but for the most part, it's very appealing, not just thanks to the production, but also because the songwriting is generally at a really high level.  Frankly, I think you could throw the same kind of praise at much of the Floyd's work--\\"Wish You Were Here\\", great album as it is, never rocks very hard at all.    Most of the lyrics here were written by Gilmour's wife Polly Samson, and although they occasionally lean towards the sickly-sweet end of things, as on \\"Smile\\", they're hardly as embarassing as some of the reviewers make them out to be.  And ultimately, Gilmour makes up for it with the music.  The title track is sumptuous--it sounds kind of like an acoustic modification of Floyd's \\"Breathe\\", featuring superb guitar work, live orchestration, and vocal harmonies from Crosby & Nash that really take the song to the next level (Richard Wright plays the Hammond on this track as well).  The super-mellow \\"The Blue\\" has a wonderfully serene, blissful feel to it, with gentle harmonica and a remarkably effective back-and-forth piano line, and Gilmour's extended soloing, even if he overdoes those swooping sounds a bit, is still really really nice, with extremely impressive tone.  The relatively short instrumental \\"Red Sky At Night\\" is an intriguing change of pace, with Gilmour switching over to saxophone, and to excellent effect--he brings the same kind of unique feeling to his sax soloing as he does to his emotional guitar leads.  \\"A Pocketful Of Stones\\" is also a really fine ballad, with Gilmour's vocal making the most of the wonderful lilting melodicism on the verses.  \\"This Heaven\\" adds a welcome diversity to the proceedings, shuffling along nicely and containing a nice bluesy acoustic riff.  \\"Smile\\", like I said, is kind of on the sugary side, but the acoustic slide guitar work, Gilmour's somewhat jazz-tinged lead vocal, and the sheer tunefulness give it much appeal.     Gilmour's previous solo album, 1984's \\"About Face\\", ends with the song \\"Near The End\\", and he ends \\"On An Island\\" with \\"Where We Start\\" which seems like a sequel to the former song.  \\"Where We Start\\" is the one non-instrumental track on the album that Gilmour wrote entirely himself.  Yes, the lyrics leave a little to be desired, but the song has an undeniably soothing and reflective feel, somewhat melancholy and yet with hope for what's still to come, a trademark Gilmour touch.  It makes for a highly fitting finale to the album.    As for the few remaining tracks...  \\"Castellorizon\\", the obligatory album-opening instrumental, starts off as a sound collage before Gilmour starts wailing away backed by a full orchestra--it's certainly more enjoyable than the somewhat similar \\"Let's Get Metaphysical\\" from his \\"About Face\\" album, but it's still pretty forgettable.  Likewise, the instrumental \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" is okayish, but pretty dull.  The one track that particularly sticks out like a sore thumb and that you're better off skipping happens to be the album's hardest-rocking song--\\"Take A Breath\\" has annoying, repetitive spoken chanting, plus it's sorely lacking in terms of melody and catchiness; it considerably hurts the overall flow of the album, and it suggests that Gilmour isn't sure how to rock out effectively anymore, making it easy to see why the album is so ballad-heavy.    All in all, I can't see anyone who loves '72-'75-era Floyd or Gilmour's previous solo work not taking a strong liking to \\"On An Island\\".  I'm well aware that this album is taking quite a beating from a lot of so-called professional critics, and I can't help but suspect it's partly because of the album's mellow tone and a lack of patience on their part to really *listen*.  Maybe some folks were hoping Gilmour would push the envelope more, and I'll admit I do understand the feeling that if an artist just cranks out an album that sounds like a copy of earlier work, there's no point to it.  That said, this is an album for diehard David Gilmour/ mid-'70s Floyd fans who have listened to those records religiously and want something familiar, yet new, and for an artist of Gilmour's age and stature, it's understandable that he'd put out a record to fit that bill, and the fact that the result sounds this fresh and effective, it not only justifies the exercise, it actually provides an additional demonstration of just how deep Gilmour's talent is.  It also underlines that this is clearly the album he wanted to make, and I give him a lot of credit for following his instincts.    (P.S.  My copy of \\"On An Island\\" includes a bonus disc featuring the laidback bluesy instrumental \\"Island Jam\\"--it's a nice little bonus.On the downside, the book-style packaging of the album is marred by the vulnerable foam rubber piece that's meant to hold the CD--you may very well end up needing a separate case to hold the disc itself.)

B000025SJ8|5.0|All perfect terms to describe this album. Burzum's first album (plus Aske ep) would be the type of things many BM bands (many in the US) would later try and copy, However, here is the originial! Varg, has to be one of the greatest BM vocals ever, up there with Ihsahn, Nocturno Culto and Daemon. Sometimes, with \\"grim\\" Black Metal, the lyrics can seem forced and cliche, exspecially depending on the vocal delivery of the vocalist. However, with his vocals, he could be singing nursery rhymes and he could still convince you. The guitars, not too hard (never said it had to be the hardest thing to play to be great.) the same story for everything else. Easy t o play or not, the must is still great in my opinion and this is one of the 20 most mandatory Black Metal albums ever recorded. You can just feel the pain and suffering in this album. You almost feel dirty after listening to this. To touch on another subject many others have, yes I think Varg has now become a childish, racist neo-nazi jackass, not to mention a murderer. All of that pushed to the side though, this is still a classic album and influenced many many bands within the genre.<br /><br />1. Feeble Screams From Forests Unknown (7:28) The cd starts with about two seconds of filthy keyboard notes before going full blast into one of the best songs here. With a simple yet memorable guitar riff going through most of the song, then once Varg kicks in on vocals the song goes to another planet. Great way to kick off an album. 5/5<br /><br />2. Ea, Lord of the Depths (4:52) \\"The Head is a Head of a Serpent<br /><br />From its Nostrils Mucus Trickles...<br /><br />The Ears Are those of a Basilisk<br /><br />His Horns Are Twisted into three Curls<br /><br />The Body is a Sun Fish, Full of Stars<br /><br />The Base of His Feet Are Claws<br /><br />His Name Is Sassu Wunnu<br /><br />A Sea Monster. A Form of Ea\\"<br /><br />With lyrics like that, you know you're in for a cold song. This song is spell binding and not one to soon be forgotten. 4.5/5<br /><br />3. Black Spell of Destruction (5:39) Starts out pretty slow and mellow for a Burzum song, right before the drums kick in a little faster. Then it settles again into a single guitar riff before retuning back to the style played in the intro. Which makes varg's voice all the more haunting. 5/5<br /><br />4. Channeling the Powers of Souls into a New God (3:27) An almost \\"beautiful\\" electronic interlude. Worth giving a few listens, repetitive though.<br /><br />5. War (2:50) DOn't et the prior song lull you into a sense of security because the next song is like an audio stab to the neck. With the most memorable guitar work on the album, you feel as if you're going to War! The best here. 10/5<br /><br />6. The Crying Orc (0:58) I'm dissapointed this is only an interlude because the guitar riff used in it was quite good and could have been made into a majestic song. 4/5<br /><br />7. My Journey to the Stars (8:10) If grim BM isn't your thing this song is going to infuriate you. long and repetitive are good ways to describe this one.The guitar riff is impressive and so is everything in general. One of the best songs here. Mandatory listening here. 5/5<br /><br />8. Dungeons of Darkness (4:52) Another interlude, stupid and pointless ?/?<br /><br />9. Stemmen Fra Taarnet (6:09) Well, this song has alot of f*cking attitude! I'll tell you that much. COming in with an almost \\"grim\\" punk influenced riff. A really simple song, still good though. Just not the strongest song here. 4/5<br /><br />10. Dominus Sathans (3:04) Starts out with an eerie and creepy riff. Some strange and low gibberish begins before a classic Varg screech ins unleashed upon your ears. Then the riff g oes on ti'll the song plays out which is pretty pointless. ?/?<br /><br />11. A LostForgotten Sad Spirit (10:52) Second best here and a classic Burzum track. Longest song on the album.

B000E6UK5K|2.0|Not a bad album, but it's not Pink Floyd. <br />It's very Beach-y and laid back - a good album to put on when you're having your next summer B-B-Q, I'd wager. It's definately Gilmour though; you can tell his guitar licks anywhere. <br /> <br />The album opens with Castellorizon; your typical instrumental Gilmour/Floyd scene-setter: plenty of string washes and slow/emotive guitar playing. <br /> <br />Then into the title track \\"On An Island\\". The track actually reminds of The Alan Parsons Project. Lovely vocal harmonies courtesy of Crosby and Nash. I quite like this one. <br /> <br />\\"The Blue\\" slows down the tempo even further (read \\"Us and Them\\") and throws in some languid harmonica. Listen to this one while relaxing in your hammock and watching seagulls. He uses that guitar effect on the solo here to make huge leaps from low to way up high. <br /> <br />\\"Take a Breath\\" has the phrase \\"Take a breath, take a deep breath now\\" through a lot of it. It's more rocking; perhaps the most Floyd-like song here. It reminds me of \\"Learning To Fly\\". <br /> <br />\\"Red Sky At Night\\" is an instrumental interlude with saxaphone taking the lead. It reminds me of something off Vangelis' Blade Runner soundtrack (Tears In The Rain?). Again, lots of string washes. <br /> <br />\\"This Heaven\\" is a kind of blues number. <br /> <br />\\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" starts out sounding like you're on a boat, with a finger-picked guitar. Then it slows down to a (yet another?) gentle instrumental, with Brian Wilson-esque bass harmonica coming through. <br /> <br />\\"Smile\\" is real interesting in that it's David singing without any echo on his voice. He sounds here like Paul McCartney in a song that could have come off 'Ram' or any other album from Maccas solo career. It even has a \\"Linda\\" singing with him (not sure who she is as I don't have the liner notes in front of me). <br /> <br />\\"A Pocketful Of Stones\\" is the 'Division Bell' of the album. A long piece that starts off with instrumentation that could have come off Yes' album 'Talk' from 1994. <br />Quite a nice piano powered song. <br /> <br />\\"Where We Start\\" is another slow 3/4-time song. <br /> <br />So, yeh - it's OK, but nothing sort of sticks out at me. I like the title track; it's nice, but wouldn't be half as memorable without the harmonies.  <br /> <br />So, 'Take a deep breath' and plunge in, but don't wonder if the water is only quite shallow.
6304712936|5.0|The movie is presented as the composer Saliery confesses his memoirs to a priest, while being in a madhouse.<br />Saliery was very jealous of Mozart's success and did whatever he could to cause Mozart sickness and death.<br />In the beginning, the movie is very funny, portraying Mozart as a tallented, but badly-behaving childish prodigy.<br />Then Saliery meets him and decides to give him a large order to compose a requiem. Mozart composes it, but Saliery's demands for quick composing are overbearing on Mozart. And Mozart eventually goes insane and dies and gets burried in a common grave. The movie represents the ironic victory of mediocrity (Saliery) over tallent (Mozart).<br /><br />The movie has nice scenery, with clothing and stage props from Mozart's time. Watch the movie and decide for yourself: are you more like Saliery, or more like Mozart?
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Couldn't wait to get home yesterday and listen to my new Gilmour CD. I won't bore you or myself with long overdraw comments and analogies of the disk. Look at my stars and know that I agree with others that posted the same scale.  <br /> <br />Basically, the first 5 songs are tollerable. The rest... I'm still confused about? Actually, upon further review, the word BORING describes the entire CD best. The Guitar solos almost take off ... maybe the solo in Blue is innovative, but the rest of them stay grounded.  I AM SO DISAPPOINTED! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B5UL7G|3.0|Not much really wrong with this cd, there's just a lack of the \\"wow\\" factor that you get from his previous efforts.  All songs are listenable, but nothing jumped out as incredible.  His first cd had \\"Let Me Entertain You\\" and \\"Angels\\" that were clearly destined to be hits.  \\"Strong\\" and \\"Millenium\\" off the second cd, and \\"Supreme\\" & \\"Better Man\\" from the third cd.  His fourth cd, \\"Escapology\\" is just a masterwork with \\"Feel\\", \\"Sexed Up\\", \\"Come Undone\\", \\"Something Beautiful\\", and \\"Love Somebody\\".  This cd lacks those type of memorable tunes.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|\\"On An Island\\" features lots of moody and atmospheric sounds reminiscent to those in Pink Floyd's More, Atom Heat Mother and Meddle. But be aware: this is a Gilmour effort, very mellow with plenty of slow tempos, which in my case i truly enjoy.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|Not being very knowledgable about previous solo Gilmour recordings, I'm of course going to compare this to Floyd. And this CD, sonically, is an amalgam of four classic Floyd albums: Meddle, Atom Heart Mother, More, and Division Bell.  <br /> <br />That's right, it sounds a lot like the pre-Dark Side post-Sid stuff. With some added bonuses - I don't think Floyd ever rocked as hard as the song \\"Take A Breath\\" nor did the vocals ever sound as captivating as \\"On an Island\\" with the Crosby/Nash harmonies. Add in some dobro and pedal steel, and it's a suprisingly diverse album that really sounds great.  <br /> <br />Lyrically, nothing challenging about it, but the presentation doesn't embarass the lyrics to the extent that reviewers have mentioned. Four stars due to the great sound and the fact that we haven't heard this in 13 years.
1932100385|5.0|This book explains scientifically a MAJOR cause of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease that if action were taken to implement the findings, the dairy and beef industries and all those business sectors that depend on the dairy and beef industries (like pizza) would be financially destroyed.  Also, the industries that profit from treating cancer, diabetes, and heart disease would be decimated as a result of the near elimination of these diseases from society.  Likely, that is why the American Cancer Society, which provided some of the funding of this 20 year study, has remained so quiet about the findings as has the \\"leaders\\" in Washington who funnel BILLIONS of dollars to fund \\"the fight against cancer, heart disease, dibetes, etc.\\"   Christians, by their very credo, are SUPPOSED to love their neighbors as themselves.  This book indicates American Capitalists love their neighbor's money above all else.
B000EGDC0A|4.0|I originally purchased \\"Supernature\\" as an import, so I've given this album a solid day in court.  While it has grown on me in the last few months, my opinion still stands:  \\"Supernature\\" is good solid stuff, but it doesn't measure up to Goldfrapp's first two albums.<br /><br />\\"Felt Mountain\\" was a dreamy voyage through svelte lounge pop, and \\"Black Cherry\\" was a spewing geyser of electro-synth technolust. \\"Supernature\\" is, musically, a perfect chimera of the two: sedate-ish pop songs with time-signatures, progressions, and structure similar to those on \\"Felt Mountain\\", but using the electronic wall-of-sound from \\"Black Cherry\\".  Like \\"Felt Mountain\\", the songs on \\"Supernature\\" are largely free of musical hooks.  This lack of hooks contributed to \\"Felt Mountain\\" being a downtempo masterpiece, but it makes pop music seem ephemeral, which is \\"Supernature\\"'s greatest weakness:  many of these songs don't stick around in your mind after they're over.  They're nice to listen to, and as far as pop music goes they're very innovative, but they just doesn't leave you haunted.<br /><br />I do enjoy this album, even though I initially found it underwhelming, because the duo are still putting together songs that are untraditional and interesting.  The arrangements have a beautiful complexity and Allison's vocalwork are clearly among the top 1% of her peers.  That said, I didn't notice this right away, and the uniqueness of the tracks really come out with repeated listens.  They're more subtle and don't rely on either raw energy (ala \\"Black Cherry\\") or a unique lounge vibe (\\"Felt Mountain\\"). So if \\"Supernature\\" doesn't live up to your immediate expectations, give it some time.  It may grow on you.<br /><br />While I think this album is the weakest in their portfolio, it's still a good listen, and besides, even Goldfrapp on an off-day makes most radio-standard pop seem like algorithm-generated plodding.<br /><br />Note:  the US release differs from the original UK edition in that it has a bonus track, \\"Beautiful\\", a B-side from the \\"Number 1\\" single, and thankfully this is one of the strongest songs on the entire CD.  For those completists out there who already have the UK version, it's really difficult to justify spending $15 just to get one new track, so if you're torn, you'd be better off tracking down the \\"Number 1\\" single (since it has \\"Beautiful\\" and another exclusive track, \\"All Night Operator\\", and some remixes).<br /><br />(In case anyone out there is wondering, unlike the import version of this album, the US release has neither copy protection nor OpenDisc-based DRM technology, which can cause problems with computers, car stereos, portable disc players, etc.  The US release is the way a music CD should be.)ul\\", a B-side from the \\"Number 1\\" single, and thankfully this is one of the strongest songs on the entire CD.

0345457692|5.0|Richard Morgan's debut novel is a fast-moving, stylish, violent detective thriller set in the distant future. I greatly enjoyed the dry, noir-ish humour and the stack/sleeve technology, which is a pretty slick new package for an existing concept (digitised personalities.) The violence may put off some readers, also the general unpleasantness of Morgan's future society; that world is certainly a cold, hard, ruthless place, ruled by soulless corporations and a monolithic and power-hungry United Nations. However, if you are looking for an action-filled yet thoughtful and well-conceived science fiction novel, look no further. Morgan's newer books are very good too!
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Stop ruining my impression of you Mr. Gilmour.  Every solo album you've ever released has been hollow, shallow and over produced.  And this one is no exception.  Lyrically you need to retire the wife and just play instrumentals.  You are incredibly talented, but you just can not seem to put it together in a solo effort.  And is it even really a solo effort when you have all this outside input?  Isn't it really David Gilmour and Friends - On an Island?  [See Todd Rundgren, Hermit of Mink Hollow for a *TRUE* solo album.]  Take your Strat and an Amp and just wail out some bluesey, emotional masterpiece, drop the producer and just give us some raw Gilmour doing what he does best.  Hell, smoke a joint or drop some acid before recording.<br /><br />There is nothing groundbreaking, interesting or creative on this CD.  I know you're talented.  I've seen you perform.  I've followed your career for many, many, many years.  Why can't you show that talent in a solo effort?  Perhaps you need Roger more than you know.  I know he desperately needs your voice to sing the lyrics he writes and your guitar to get his point across.<br /><br />Mr. Gilmour, please do something without Roger and the rest of the band to let your talent shine.<br /><br />This CD is a perfect example of why people download music.  Prior to that ability, more people might have actually wasted $15 on this coaster.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|Ok, it's Clapton, so if you're mildly a rock 'n roll fan, Clapton is hard to ignore. But, Clapton doesn't sound hungry or earnest on these brilliant RJ cuts. Quite frankly, he hasn't in a long while either. If these weren't Robert Johnson songs, this would be a generic lullaby set from one lazy dude. Start by getting the original Johnson cuts, then if you're an EC fan, might as well get this. Otherwise, flip a coin on this one.
B00005JO1R|3.0|Yes, I was disappointed because I thought it would focus more as a biography on Johnny Cash than a sick, twisted, obsession/love story between Cash and June Carter which almost killed him and his career.   <br /> <br />However, I will say that this is the finest acting job Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix both have done to date.  They gave excellent performances but the movie as a whole just wasn't that exciting where you'd watch it again and again.   <br /> <br />Eventhough I'm not a big fan of country music, I was looking for the movie to give me a reason why Cash became the ICON he was, and was looking for more into why his father (played well by Robert Patrick, my favorite Terminator of Terminator 2 fame) and him had such a horrible relationship even before his brother died, and well after.  It was almost as if they portrayed CASH as a man who couldn't function partly because of his starved approval he desperately wanted from his father which obviously we know, he'd never get.   <br /> <br />I think the director wasted a lot of time not going in depth about what it was about June Carter that made CASH basically abandon his first wife and children and go on a psychopathic trail to get her.   <br /> <br />As far as the prison scene at Folsom, there was a lot more interaction between CASH and the inmates that was left out.  After all the Live From Folsom CD was not only his so-called comeback album, but one of the biggest lp's at that time outselling even the Beatles.   <br /> <br />Overall, I don't blame the actors/actresses I blame the director for not utilizing them more and going more into depth about CASH's life.  It almost felt like an MTV movie.  The Two Disc set is cool and gives you extended performances of CASH and June Carter.

B000DZIGDU|3.0|Were intentions graded instead of product, then JARHEAD would be given 4 stars rather than 3, merely because it is one of the few films (so far) that shows the particular idiosyncrasies of that first Bush war, the DESERT SHIELD transforming into DESERT STORM.  We have many films that document the mindset of the soldiers from the Civil War through the two World Wars, to Korean War to Vietnam War and each is different.  JARHEAD is as much about the changes that have occurred in the American military with the advent of computerized warfare and sophisticated war machines and weapons as it is about the Greed for Oil Dominance that prompted the US Kuwaiti involvement.  And for that this film is important and will remain so until something better comes along.<br /><br />The story is rather minimal and as narrated by the author of the novel on which it is based, Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), it takes a while to become airborne.  Swoff is a disillusioned kid who can't figure out how to make life meaningful so he opts for the USMC as a staging zone in his growth. What he discovers is the usual boot camp mentality and training, encountering other men who have both similar and different reasons for joining the Corps: Troy (Peter Saarsgard) has dark issues that remain with him throughout the story; Kruger (Lucas Black) opted for the Corps instead of prison; Cortez (Jacob Vargas) needed money to support his pregnant wife; Cuban immigrant Escobar (Laz Alonso) sincerely is a grateful patriot, etc. Along the way the boys encounter the stereotype DI (Scott MacDonald), the Staff Sergeant (Jamie Fox) and the company commander Lt Col Kazinski (Chris Cooper) as well as the usual variety of testosterone provoked young kids successfully brainwashed to be 'fighting men'.<br /><br />The bulk of the story after boot camp is the boredom of going to war in the Kuwaiti desert, having nothing at all to do except play dumb games and wait and hydrate, until at last the Staff Sergeant gleefully announces Saddam Hussein is shooting and they are off to actually do what they were trained to do - Fight!  But even that is thwarted as they wade through a miserable existence of seeing sky-darkened oil well fires, constant oil raining from the burning oil money holes, losing buddies to friendly fire and mistaken attacks by their own air support.  And just at the point when this company of trained snipers (especially Swoff and Troy) gets the chance to kill, the 'war' is over and they go home.  And in Swofford's narrative comments he notes how those men will never be allowed to leave the desert experience behind. 'Wars are different, yet wars are the same'.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal, buffed and shaved headed, gives us everything Swoff represents - as far as the meager script and misguided direction by Sam Mendes allow.  He is a fine actor and his range of emotions is what holds the film together.  The remainder of the cast likewise does their best to make their shadowy character outlines from the screenplay by William Broyles Jr. as close to three-dimensional as the lines allow.  Yes, the film is about a new kind of soldier, one less driven by patriotism and more informed about the commercial greed that drives these fiascos, and Mendes does allow us to see that.  But deeper character development and motivation could have made this a more powerful antiwar statement than a visual excursion of life under the sun of the foreign desert skies.

B000E42MU8|5.0|PRIDE & PREJUDICE is a handsomely mounted production, moodily filmed with a pervasive dark texture of visual expression about it. It is quite a visual presentation of the story where dialogue is left unspoken and the power of the images both animate and inanimate speak for themselves. That is not to say that the film goes on without dialogue, but rather quite the opposite. The many exchanges of dialogue are witty, brilliantly structured, eloquently spoken and presented with an economy of style that is concisely intelligent. This film with its intricately mounted visuals and words does an admirable job of bringing this literary work to the screen with all the constraints inherent in the medium of the cinema. Director Joe Wright also did a more than commendable job of representing the two main characters. Keira Knightley gives an awe-inspiring performance as Lizzie giving her great insight of the human condition. Lizzie though impetuous at times has a gift of rationalizing human behavior with a certain sense of reality offsetting loftier romantic ideals thus making her a young woman of keen intelligence. I truly enjoyed Matthew MacFadyen's performance as Darcy. He seems a young man tired and perplexed by convention but knows no other way to conduct himself and is trapped by his by his social status but more importantly by his own upbringing. Matthew MacFadyen's does an exceptional job conveying this. Awkwardly trying to emote his inner feelings he does more to alienate Lizzie than win her affections. MacFadyen's Darcy is truly a man misunderstood. Only through good and anonymous deeds can the true nature of the man prevail. I think this is a very good film rich with artistic fervor yet embracing all that is good of the human spirit.

B000BYA5GO|4.0|I saw almost back to back the Flightplan (with Jodie Foster), The Weatherman\\", and this one, both with Nicholas Cage as main actor.  <br /> <br />These are three very different films, but \\"Lord of War\\" was the best in my opinion. Despite being a \\"low budget film\\", as the producers tell us in the extra features on disc 2, it really brings up interesting issues that most people would probably not have thought of.  <br /> <br />I found this film to be excellent. The acting is top of the line. Those who know Nicholas Cage will not be disappointed. Those who don't know him can watch this film before watching \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\", then \\"Family man\\", a sharp comedy, and maybe \\"Gone in sixty seconds\\". That way, you will have a good sample of this actor's talents, which keeps improving, film after film. Cage's brother in this film also does some great acting (keep an eye on this actor). The rest of the cast is also very acceptable in their own roles, especially the Liberian dictator. As to the special effects, they are perfect. See the landing of the Antonov on the dust road for instance. It is shot with real people, a real aircraft, and an almost real dust road. Nothing overdone, nothing too computerized, but bang, effective ! <br /> <br />The shooting of the film is also impeccable, showing the journey of a bullet at the very beginning of the film (it ends up in a young boy's head), a vulture attacking a dead body, tanks lined up during a negotiation between cage and a seller, the plane sequence mentioned before, as well as the constant contrasts New York VS. Black Africa.  <br /> <br />Do not miss the dark humour that pops up here and there; for instance, Cage reminding the dictator that it is bloodbath, and not bath of blood, or that you say warlord, and not lord of war (and maybe risking his life by daring to contradict the \\"client\\").  Or, during the landing of the Antonov, Cage telling the pilot that he is the best and can do it (narrating to us that he actually wasn't,that the pilot finished 35th out of 36 at the Moscow school of pilots). Or the lack of culinary talent of Cage's brother, which ends up being tragi-comical.  <br /> <br />The film is also well done because the of the loops it goes into. The brother keeps on getting back into his bad habits, Cage gives up the trading before falling again, the interpol agent keeps on helplessly chasing Cage, and the film ends up right the way it started. With a shot of tons of bullets on the ground. That is probably the main message : things don't change, and even if you try, there is too much money and \\"interests\\" involved. The gray market (and even the official one) of weapons sale is here to stay... The sad part ? Cage reminds it several times : he doesn't do anything illegal... because there are loopholes in most legislations. And because the main countries involved in this as sellers are the five that are on the UN security council... <br /> <br />A couple of final words :  (1) the extra dvd is very interesting; it talks about the weapons industry (who gets what and how and where it goes), you get explanations of the special effects, you get a sort of catalogue of the main weapons sough after on the market, and you get an explanation of the difficulties the filmmakers had to overcome (for instance, it ended up being cheaper for them to buy 3000 Kalashnikovs than making fake ones, or that the Antonov used in the film belonged to an actual weapon dealer, who lent it to them !) (2) Don't watch this film with children or sensitive people. It has very strong sequences (children executed somewhere in Palestine, the dictator blowing one of his bodyguards head by surprise, a camp of refugees in black Africa being cut to pieces with machetes). That doesn't change anything to the rating though. It is an excellent film !
B0009K7RES|4.0|If you liked Marks album \\"Shangri-La\\", you'll love this live CD. He sounds great and the versions are all a little different.
B000002OX5|5.0|Though people may mention this is the first concept album, what is more important to me is that it is poking fun at the music industry. Just as \\"rock\\" was becoming serious music and rock journalism was beginning, The Who decided to have some fun with the idea and space the straight songs such as the pop perfection of \\"I Can See for Miles\\" with \\"commercials\\" such as \\"Heinz Baked Beans\\". Yes everyone was trying to live up to Sergeant Pepper but the Who were obviously having fun on the tongue in cheek aspects of this album, unlike the Stones' \\"Satanic Majesties\\" which except for a few songs is dated on arrival.  Also \\"Sell Out\\" is quintesintially English, not the maudlin ballads of the Small Faces but closer to the Kinks and equally valid in the pre-punk roster. The additional tracks are essential. They should have been there from the beginning. Each song is totally different. Having fun with psychadelia on \\"Armenia, City in the Sky\\", mocking societal conventions with \\"Tattoo\\" to the soundtrack to the Charles Dickens movie that never was \\"Silas Stingy\\" (anyone who thinks of John Entwhistle as \\"just the bassist\\" obviously forgets about his classic morbid ditties that completed the albums). The cynicism about the nascent rock industry and getting a spot on Top of the Pops and all that was unique at the time without descending to the dated art rock of Zappa. Play this back to back with the Fall's \\"This Nations Saving Grace\\" and you may find some uncanny similarities.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|I remeber seeing the previews when it was in theaters, but I never got around to seeing it.  Anyway I rented it and it was one of the better movies that I have seen lately. <br /> <br />The story is very dark, but it is one of people achieving success only to find that when they get there it is not all that they hoped that it would be.  It also showed how even when you think that you are above everything you are selling little pieces of your soul along the way. <br /> <br />I could have done without the plot line involving Yuri's brother after he left the \\"business\\" the first time, but he needed to be brought back in to complete Yuri's arc. <br /> <br />The movie has also motivated me to investigate the final line on the screen indicating that the movie was based upon actual events.  I knew all along that there were black market arms deals going on, but the movie illuded to things much larger than what I had guessed were going on. <br /> <br />Ultimately, I think that this movie deserved a bit more acclaim than in received.
B00000064E|5.0|Every song on this album reeks of sadness. Not the put on pale make-up and put on a show sadness but a genuine rejection of the idea that life has any capacity to be enjoyed.  \\"Time has Told Me\\" has a wistfulnes that perhaps the woman he imagines in the song will take him out of the doldrums but the hope ends there. \\"River Man\\" is a poetic dirge that perhaps (using poetic license) that the riverman of the underworld mentioned in Greek mythology will take him away from this life. \\"Day is Done\\" imagines, perhaps, a typical day where at the end nothing has been accomplished and is now coming to an end.  \\"Fruit Tree\\" worries about impending fame. Even the very idea of being recognized by people brings on more sadness (Nick Drake rarely performed live though his performances were legendary though unfortunately no known recordings exist). Though his lyrics are closer to romantic era English poetry and not the wild flights of the imagination of Syd Barrett, this album and all other releases by Nick Drake still hold up. His music is reflective and poignant rather than pointlessly morbidly depressive. The orchestral embellishments enhance the music. Five Leaves Left is my favorite Nick Drake album though I'd reccomend them all.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|WOW!, This album is magnificently boring and highly uneventful.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say besides that it has all been done before and in a much better way.  I find it hard to believe that someone out there can enjoy the two uptempo songs \\"Take a Breath\\" and \\"This Heaven\\".  Similar thoughts are expressed regarding the remainder of this narcotic.  Regarding his guitar playing... read the second sentence above.  Melodies are also unmemorable.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and consider David Gilmour to be my favorite guitarist but maybe it's finally time that he retire if these are going to be the results of his labor.<br /><br />This disc should come with a warning label informing the consumer to not operate machinery while under the influence of \\"On An Island\\".
B000E97Y6K|2.0|Let me preface this by saying that I had great expectations for \\"Kong\\" because of LOTRs, which Peter Jackson et al. created and put to screen in some of the greatest films since Hollywood's Golden Age. <br /> <br />In my opinion, \\"Kong\\" failed to live up to the hype (many newspapers ran stories arguing that it would become only the second movie to gross $1 billion in the U.S.).  The first hour is boring, and not because of the lack of action.  It is boring in the contrary to the first hour of \\"Spider-Man 2,\\" which contained little first-hour action but maintained a great sense of character development and humor.  The next two hours are just too long, espeically the exuberant and exaggerated use of semi-slow motion filming during the Skull Island native scenes (bringing to mind the ridiculous filmmaking in \\"The Patriot\\").  The whole scene where the giant leeches and bugs kill the party also reflected years of cheesy film violence from inferior filmmakers to Peter Jackson.  The writing was less mature and refined than the LOTR series, including the use of profanity and cheesy lines instead of actually showing greater intelligence in the scripting of the movie. <br /> <br />I absolutely loved the scenes where Kong was actually on screen and agree with the Academy Awards(c) decisions to grant them awards for sound, design, etc.  The T-Rexes vs. Kong scenes were incredible, Anne and Kong's relationship was much deeper than in previous \\"Kongs,\\" and the final scenes in New York were masterful. <br /> <br />All in all, this movie lacked too much to become either a great movie or a classic movie.  2 or 2 1/2 stars are all it deserves.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I and a group of friends went to see this movie at the theater.  At least two of us fell asleep during the showing.  I was bored and couldn't wait for it to be over.  I was shocked to hear that Keira Knightley received an Academy Award nomination, her acting skills, in this movie, consisted of grinning.  The script was shallow and sets cheap.  I'm sorry this does not even come close to the Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle version.  I can sit through all six hours of that version with no complaints and certainly no napping.
B000083C49|3.0|the fourth installment of star trek is a refreshing change from the serious, at times depressing theme of star trek III.  this one successfully incorporates alot of humor and a lighthearted theme of compassion and humility.  kirk and the crew time travel back to 20th century earth in order to save the earth of the 23rd century.  thumbs up for this one.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is probably the best movie I have ever viewed.  The actors are so very talented that you feel that you know the characters.  Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are the best Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet ever.  If you've seen this version, you would laugh at the thought of Keira Kneightly being nominated for an Oscar as Elizabeth.  I can't imagine another actress surpassing Jennifer Ehle's portrayal.
B00004RFFI|5.0|Ten years ago this film surpassed my expectations, it also started the new computer-gennerated era of films. the plot is not the best, but it also isn't the films main attraction. the real appeal is in the action, which is breathtaking, complete with falling houses, exploding cars, flying cows, and one hell of an F-5 tornado, all in all a very entertaining film for people of all ages.
B000002J09|5.0|I find it hard not to give most of Led Zeppelin's albums 5 stars because they were just that good. IV aka Runes aka ZOSO was a monster release in 1971 by this hard rocking band and just proved that their musical variations appealed to the masses as much as any other British group in history including The Beatles, Rolling Stones or The Who. This album will always be remembered as the 'Stairway To Heaven' album but there is much more to it than just that one song. Cadillac recognized their popularity by using 'Rock and Roll' in their commercials to appeal to the masses of baby boomers. 'Black Dog' is a powerful opener and the blues monster 'When The Levee Breaks' closes this album. In between there is a whole lotta Zep that merits recognition. Just buy it, listen and you'll know what I mean. An album that belongs in any rock collection but don't forget the rest of the Led Zeppelin catalog to go along with it.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|This film will entertain you to death, it has the right dose of action, sf/x, and even some humor. the performances are great, will and vivica have great chemistry, and bill pullman is a very convincing president. I highly recommend this film for a rainy day.
B0007P3582|1.0|I am not a rap fan but I am willing to give a listen to anyone that actually attempts to be an artist. I heard a couple of songs from this CD recently and must say that 50 cent is a no talent criminal. Why is he a criminal you ask? Because he is ripping off anyone that buys his pathetic, so called music. This is nothing short of talentless garbage that demeans the beauty of real MUSIC. -100 stars if I could do it.
B000E6UK32|5.0|First Off...BUY THIS PACKAGE! It's one of the best of Blondie Compilations out there simply because you have the videos to go along with a very visual band.<br /><br />  Secondly...there are whimpers and complaints that they deleted the two songs for the U.S. release, X-offender and Preasence Dear, due to the fact that they were primarily U.K. hits and singles. X-offender was only relased in the U.S. as a promo single to their 1st album and Preasence Dear was only a U.K. single as well as a top ten hit there and I'm sure record execs found no need an American audience would buy UK hits.<br />They deleted them to compliment the CD/DVD package.<br /><br />(SOUND)<br />Also, the songs featured here are in ther SINGLE EDIT form because you can only fit so many songs onto an 80-minute CD.<br />Atomic is the 3:50 single version<br />Heart Of Glass is the radio version at 4:10 not the original single version that was only 3:22<br />Maria is the short radio version at 4:10<br />Rapture is the heavily edited radio version at 4:57<br />Tide Is High thankfully is at the radio edit of 3:51<br />In The Flesh is a NEW RECORDED MIX with Miss Guy on backing Vocals<br />One Way Or Another is the radio mix version (it's slightly shorter and varies from the album version)<br />Island Of Lost Souls is the single version at 3:47<br />Good Boys is the Blow-Up 12\\" Version which frankly is an awesome remix<br />Call Me is the ever popular single version at 3:30<br />and Sunday Girl is the original single version which is several seconds longer in the fade out at 3:12<br />  I do however like the fact they added Fade Away and Radiate to the Greatest Hits compilation. It was always one of thier better songs.<br /><br />(VISION)<br />The videos that are here are in their complete entirety EXCEPT Rapture (which for soem unknown reson taken from the home video version of Best Of Blondie and is grainy) and Heart Of Glass (which was taken from the home video The Complete Pitcture which used the 1981 remix of Heart Of Glass instead of the original video audio and is grainy).<br />  All videos look exceptional given their age and have a fantastic remastered 2.0 stereo sound to them.<br />  UNFORTUNATELY, the video for The Tide IS High is the VH-1 Version and not the original conceptual video. This video uses video stills from Eat To The Beat and pans the Record Cover.<br />  The video for Rapture Riders is just ok given it's just two videos split next to each other so it looks like Debbie and Jim are singing together.<br /><br />Buy the superior European edition Blondie: Greatest Hits: Sight & Sound rather than the US Sound & Vision. It's a better CD and DVD companion since they have extra tracks included.All videos look exceptional given their age and have a fantastic remastered 2.0 stereo sound to them.

B000002J1U|5.0|I have to admit that when this album came out in 1970 I was a little let down because it came on the heels of two monster albums in Led Zeppelin I & II and just didn't sound like the same band. However, soon I was transfixed by the melodic, acoustical side of the group and realized that Plant, Page, Jones and Bonham were evolving and growing into a more complex band. The 'Immigant Song' opens this stanza of Zep and briefly it seemed that they were headed in the same direction but then songs like 'Friends', 'Celebration Day', 'Since I've Been Loving You', 'Gallows Pole', 'Tangerine', 'That's The Way' and 'Hats Off To (Roy) Harper' enter and the listener is treated to a very good collection of Led Zeppelin songs meant to relay the message: we will always keep you guessing as to what is next...
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I didn't grow up a country music fan, but I remember my father speaking highly of Johnny Cash.  I watched this film with little knowledge of Cash's life and troubles, but walked away moved by his and June Carter's commitment to wrestle with life.<br /><br />As so many have pointed out, the acting in this movie is stellar.  Phoenix is one of my favorite actors of this generation, bringing depth and intensity to his roles.  Witherspoon has always been a natural on the screen, but she truly shines in this story.  The cinematography is also fantastic, capturing light and mood in a beautiful balance.<br /><br />I walked away from the movie challenged by the artistic drive of the characters, touched by the fearful acceptance of love by two hurting people, and wanting more Cash.  What about the next 35 years of their lives together?  Surely there's more rich material in this couple's history.<br /><br />Now I too shall speak highly of Cash to my children.
B000069KGM|5.0|This is the best album Chicago did, followed by Chicago II and III (don't get me wrong because they did do some great music in later albums but just not as powerful). Why do I say this? Because they blended hard rock with jazz better than any group I've ever heard of that era and that includes Blood, Sweat and Tears. They were political revolutionaries and having lived during the turmoil of the late 60s, this just appealed to me. They were a new sound at that time and they hit a home run with this monster. Terry Kath was one of the best guitarists of his generation and belonged in the company of Hendrix IMO. Robert Lamm and Peter Cetera lead the group with powerful vocals. James Pankow was the leader of brass arrangements and Daniel Seraphine played the drums with precisioned rhythm. Together the group presented a definite message that lives today and belongs in the library of any classic rock enthusiast. Highlights include: 'Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?, 'Beginnings', 'Questions 67 & 68' and the Spencer Davis Group remake 'I'm A Man'.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|\\"On an Island\\" is definately David's best solo album of the three he has released.  His voice is top notch and sounds very dreamy at times.  As always, his guitar playing is great, it is some of his best guitar playing - IMHO.  It's great to hear fellow Floyd Richard Wright harmonize with him on, The Blue - takes you back to some of the early Floyd.  David Crosby and Graham Nash also do a wonderful job on the title track.  If you love Pink Floyd and David Gilmour, you will definately love this one.
B0000029AP|5.0|I originally gave this 4 stars but cannot seriously give the cd that has 'Walk This Way', 'Sweet Emotion' and 'Toys In The Attic' anything less than 5 stars.<br /><br />This was released when the boys rocked.  If you've only heard their recent stuff then this is going to come as a bit of an adjustment.  Nothing but straight ahead rock here boys and girls.  If you're looking for polished top 40 music then you had best go somewhere else.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This film rocks on so many levels.  I'm so happy it's finally being released in the US.  I dled a copy and watched it 2 times in one nite.  The graphics are amazing, and the story is top notch.  Thank God they didn't fall into the Spirits Within conundrum.  The characters are strong and the effects are amazing.  If you like movies with crazy fighting sequences this is one for you.  Some of the best fights I've ever seen.  Whenever it finally gets released I advise you run to the store and buy it.  Thank you Square...
B0000029AL|3.0|Mama Kin and Dream On stand out on this debut but listeners who are only familiar with recent Aerosmith will probably find this to be a largely boring effort.  This debut represents a snapshot of the band when they were starting out as a largely blues oriented rock band.  Cool in the 70's but only for completists now.  If you want to get Dream On or Moma Kin then pick up one of the many greatest hits collections.  For those looking to get Aerosmith from the 70's that still holds up I recommend 'Toys in the attic'.  'Toys' was a high water mark during the early years - before drugs and booze took them into galaxies far, far away.
B0009A40ES|5.0|I popped this sucker into my DVD player ready for a boring social commentary, and was utterly spun around.  Christian Bale plays his character with conviction and purpose that is hardly seen in movies today.  To call it an oscar performance might be a little over the top, but it was excellent.  We follow Christian as he struggles through work days strung out of his mind and bored to death of the time spent with his \\"friends\\".  Even his gf/fiancee has no clue what's going on in his mind.  The violents scenes are excellent, and the balance of horror and social commentary bring to mind a mix of Romero's Dead Trilogy (SOCIAL COMMENTARY) and History of Violence (Violence).  If you enjoyed any of the aforementioned films you might enjoy this.  Highly recommended, and doesn't suffer from the dreaded lack of replayablilyt issue so many films suffer from today.
B000002572|5.0|This is the classic rock band.  The impact Tom Scholtz had on the way guitars are recorded cannot be measured.  I can still remember being very little and seeing the futuristic cover of the this debut album.  Back then you always wondered if the music on the album was as good as the cover art.  In this case the answer was a definite 'Yes'.  Unfortunately, classic rock stations have overplayed all of these songs - to the point even I have come to take them for granted.  This is unfair.  The sounds on this release need to be heard on something better than radio.  Should be in every collection.  Purchase and listen to 'Smokin' first.  You'll be glad you did.
B000002UAX|5.0|It's still amazing to me, a first generation Fab Four Fan, the range of emotions the Beatles evoke even after all of these years. This album is not my favorite (that goes to Revolver), but the range of songs and styles never ceases to amaze. I'll spare you all a track by track review (with nearly 900 reviews, someone's already done that), but suffice to say the tracks range from brilliant (While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Mother Nature's Son, Julia) to \\"oh no, there they go again\\" (Revolution 9, Wild Honey Pie, Why Don't We Do It In Road). My personal fave is Yer Blues, maybe the only song on the album when they were all in the same room at the same time. Peace.
B000009HF2|3.0|Ok, I'm going to take a beating for this review but I cannot give this more than 3 stars.  Why?  Frampton was and is a great guitar player but his songs were never great.  Yes, I owned this album when it first came out - caught up in the hype - but I never played it as much as the other records I had in my collection.  There are some highlights (Do you feel like we do, Jumping Jack Flash) but to me it was a live album that came out at the right time, had the right sound to get it on the airwaves, and a front man with rock star looks.  Yes it does remind me of that time but not enough to make me play it very often.<br />One note: the early reviewer who claims Frampton is a terrible guitarist is dead wrong.  The claim that Jason Becker, Dream Theater, or Yngwie Malmsteen would blow him off the stage is a statement which I'm sure these 3 artists would disagree.  Frampton is a very good blues guitarist.  He's just not a great songwriter.  I saw him onstage backing up Bowie on the 'Glass Spider' tour in the late 80's and it was awesome.
B0002DKCMQ|4.0|Okay. It's not Citizen Kane. It's not The Bicycle Thief. I get really tired of \\"critics\\" not giving comedies the accolades they deserve because they were silly or goofy. It's a COMEDY! Lighten up! If you don't take it too seriously, this movie is a riot! From \\"Scotty Doesn't Know\\" sung by Matt Damon, to the soccar hooligan opening beer bottles with his eye sockets, to the 'safe word\\", to the great exchange rate in Bratislava, this movie had me in tears I was laughing so hard. <br /> <br />The actors are all very good, especially Michele Trachtenberg, who shows some great skin along with great comedic timing and expressions. This film is sill, goofy and full of sterotypes taken to the furthest level but always in the name of good fun. I had a great time watching this film. Critics really need to adjust their thining on comedies.
0393317552|5.0|I'm still reading this book, but I'm going to tell you my thoughts after the first 200 pages.  I've gotten to read about the fascinating circumstances that led to Western dominance of the modern world.  Who would have thought that something as simple as the size of seeds in the local wild grasses would ultimately lead to Europe's eventual conquest of the entire globe (except China).<br /><br />And Native Americans had a distinct disadvantage because local large mammals were not easily domesticated, which meant they weren't subject to all of the diseases that Europeans dealt with by living closely to cattle, pigs and sheep.  So Europeans arriving in the New World quickly spread new diseases to the Native Americans, wiping out their numbers before the fights even began.<br /><br />Natural selection of the human species.  A history book starting approximately 13000 years ago.  Put simply, it's the Book of Genesis for atheists.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I'm absolutely in love with this cd, I can't get enough.  Idina Menzel as Elphaba is such a perfect match.  I wasn't such a big fan of the book, but the adaptation from book to broadway musical changed my opinion dramatically.  One of my absolute favorite musicals, each song is just as amazing as the one before it.
B00005JLF5|5.0|This is the now classical introduction that appeared in the 1990s, changed Star Trek and sci fi on TV forever. I initially ignored the series in 1993, I was busy completing my college capstone classes to watch this epic from the beginning. Sadly this is a major regret, as I am a rabid Trekkie. The show did not make much sense after I did have time to catch a few episodes. The characters were full of conflict, darkness and mostly alien.  <br /> <br />I liked The Next Generation enough. I found most of the characters sterile. The plot was good, for the most part. The show went off the air with much fanfare. I was disappointed. The big screen adventures were good. DS9 felt just the opposite. I felt there was no way for a big screen adaption. Indeed, DS9 became a TV production that could not be contained within the big screen format.  <br /> <br />The 1990s produced some of the best TV original series of all time-Twin Peakes, Northern Exposure, X-Files just to name a few. DS9 tops the list as far as effort, care to storyline, and budget are concerned. The first season moves rather slowly, with minimal action. The best episode is \\"Emissary\\", as it presents the entire plot that is introduced for the series.  <br /> <br />The clean lines of the Federation are a little blurred. The scientific premise is challenged by mysticism. Aliens, both amiable and hostile abound! This is the beginning of a great adventure that will live forever in hearts and imaginations of the fans. It whets appetites for more. Bring It On!

B00006LIRI|3.0|The best of 1990-2000 is not here. 16 songs in chronological order could have been: <br /> <br />1. Night And Day (1990): U2's only great remake foreshadowed the changes to come. <br />2. Until The End of the World (1990): Written for movie (of same name) prior to Achtung Baby. U2's most underated song. <br />3. The Fly (1991): The new U2 sound officially arrives. <br />4. Mysterious Ways (1991): Their first \\"pop\\" record of the 1990's.  <br />5. One (1991) <br />6. Even Better Than The Real Thing (1991) <br />7. Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses (1991) - Acoustic version. <br />8. Numb (1993): Another new U2 sound. <br />9. Stay (1993): Great single from Zooropa. <br />10. Lemon (1993): A very different U2 song but it certainly takes you places. <br />11. Miss Sarajevo (1995): A true anthem - but the full version please. <br />12. Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me (1996) <br />13. Discotheque (1997): First POP single. <br />14. Staring At The Sun (1997): Another decent POP song. <br />15. Mofo (1997): The true sound of POP. <br />16. The Sweetest Thing (1998): The 1984 remake. <br /> <br />All the hits (Beautiful Day, Stuck In A Moment, Walk On and Elevation) from ATYCLB plus the Atomic Bomb hits go on the 2000-2010 Greatest Hits.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I just love musicals, especially this one.  It has everything, a good score, great actors and a wonderful storyline.  If you like Judy Garland then you'll love this movie!!
0451167716|5.0|When I first saw the movie, Godfather, I liked it but wasn't that sure of what was going on and who all the people were.  But after reading the book the movie made much more sense to me, and made it that much better. <br /> <br />The book also has additional information about certain characters which was great to read.  In my opinion, because of the book I have a greater appreciation for the characters in the movie and the movie itself.  <br /> <br />I'd reccomend reading this to anybody who likes to read about the mob, or who would like clarification about the movie.
1577314808|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone (and have been telling everyone I know about it).  The concepts are familiar from similar types of books but instead of the fluffy, feel-good stuff in other books, Mr. Tolle gives real life ways of being more peaceful.  Believe me, if you apply his principles to your life you will be at peace.  But it takes practice so don't get discouraged with yourself.  Think about how long you have been thinking the way you currently think so if it takes a couple months or a couple years isn't it worth it to have inner peace?  The principles outlined in this book as well as Mr. Tolle's \\"A New Earth\\" should be taught in every church, school and workplace.  It's not about any religion, so if you can overlook the references to evolution, anyone can apply these principles to their lives.
B0000507R0|1.0|Beware all 2-channel audiophile enthusiasts!  Even though the back cover and booklet of the ELP Brain Salad Surgery DVD-A note a 2 channel mix is available, a 2 channel mix is not available on the disc.  The menu offers a 5.1 audio option, and for the video portion, a 2 channel mix.
B000AP04FG|3.0|This movie was cute, it kept my attention, plus I love Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  I hope I spelled their names correctly.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|Gilmour's voice is clear as ever and it's just about impossible to NOT hear past Pink Floyd music in this CD.  Shine On You Crazy Diamond comes to mind.  But it's Pink Floyd Lite for sure. That familiar whine and wail of Gilmour's guitar is there, so the PF fan may not miss that.  It's a good listen, even if it's an easy listen.  Brings back memories of days gone by.  Glad I got this puppy on sale.<br /><br />51 minutes, definitely worth a listen.
B000286RNY|5.0|one of the best kung fu comedies i have ever seen!! i highly recommend kung fu hustle by stephen chow as well!!! or any of his movies.. they are all hilarious!
B0009TRRN0|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen.  It has enough of everything to please all types of sword fighting martial arts fans.   <br /> <br />Story line is great, acting is wonderful, and how can you go wrong with the kid narrarating the whole movie. <br /> <br />Fans of early work by Wu-Tang Clan would also recognize this move as the one used for all the sound bites for Gza's 'Liquid Swords'. <br /> <br />I Highly Recommend it to all.
B000035Z1Z|4.0|Okay, so it's not exactly a great cinematic accomplishment.  Still, the plot is fun and the characters are well-played; if you like Meg Ryan in anything else, you'll like her in \\"French Kiss\\".  Think of it as a good rainy day or date film - and definitely a great value for the price.
1878424319|3.0|The book was very helpful in learning some basic things of how our emotions can overpower us. I found some of the suggestions in the book to be useful, however the author of the book expresses the ideas of the book through his own world view, which does not agree with basic Judaeo-Christian teachings. I wish the teachings were taught without the aincent Native American religion.
B000001ELP|4.0|Situation;At the end of the 70s decade rock band KISS went on a trying period.They tried disco with Dynasty who went platinum and was a hit with disco fans and Unmasked who went gold and was a hit in Australia now they try a new concept for that album `orchestral`was going to be it.<br /><br />When they came back from the Unmasked Australia tour they decided to go back to rock n roll but their producer Bob Ezrin changed things he wanted the band to do an orchestral album wich they did.Its a brilliant album but it isnt KISS to be honnest they dont sound as they once did but its good if you give it a chance.<br /><br />The movie concept;The Elder was supposed to be a movie and this album the soundtrack but the movie never got to see the day.Ace and Eric wanted to rock but they were outvoted as Eric couldnt vote (he wasnt an original member).But the album also has rock tunes.<br /><br />The concept was medival time and a boy (just a boy)was soon to be on a quest(oddysay).As the booklet tell a bit of things its misleading ,the movie who have made things much clearer.It wouldnt have been like `KISS met the phantom` but i would have loved to see it.<br /><br />Songs;Well the album isnt ALL orchestral but `Fanfare` and some others are.Ace made a nice contribution `Dark light`wich is probably the best song here he has a great solo on it.The heaviest song is `The oath` a great song the heavist thing since `love gun`.<br /><br />Other highlight is `under the rose` it has orchestral sound and voice but it gives a nice effect to it.The single they released for that was orchestral `a world without heroes`  the fans didnt quite like that and The Elder.Its clearly different and it almost killed KISS because of it.<br /><br />Result;The Elder didnt have just bad side it was a valuable experiment and a change over the other albums.It would get them focused to give an awesome album`creatures of the night`one of their heavist albums.Its nice to have a changes even if this one was a big change if every album is the same then it would get boring after a while.<br /><br />Gene and Paul told that they didnt knew who they were and think its a misstep,it certainly was a different album but its not a misstep i think.The Elder has some amazing parts and the album isnt totaly orchesral and fans of rock n roll stuff then buy it for `Dark light` and `The oath`.<br /><br />The Elder is one of the only KISS albums that didnt went gold just to come to the conclusion thats it wasnt appreciated by fans and unfairly underrated stuff.<br /><br />The cover;The album cover is mysterious a hand on a door?it does look medival.There was an issue with the hand on the cover it was supposed to be someone else`s hand on the cover but Paul dissagred and said his hands were better so the hand you see on the cover is Paul`s hand.If you dont belive me read kiss;behind the mask book.<br /><br />Despite fans not liking The Elder i do like it but you got to accept that it really isnt destroyer or another album  if you like orchesral you might like it.Good album even with all the bad events surrounding this album.one was a big change if every album is the same then it would get boring after a while. <br /> <br />Gene and Paul told that they didnt knew who they were and think its a misstep,it certainly was a different album but its not a misstep i think.The Elder has some amazing parts and the album isnt totaly orchesral and fans of rock n roll stuff then buy it for `Dark light` and `The oath`. <br /> <br />The Elder is one of the only KISS albums that didnt went gold just to come to the conclusion thats it wasnt appreciated by fans and unfairly underrated stuff. <br /> <br />The cover;The album cover is mysterious a hand on a door?it does look medival.There was an issue with the hand on the cover it was supposed to be someone else`s hand on the cover but Paul dissagred and said his hands were better so the hand you see on the cover is Paul`s hand.If you dont belive me read kiss;behind the mask book. <br /> <br />Despite fans not liking The Elder i do like it but you got to accept that it really isnt destroyer or another album  if you like orchesral you might like it.Good album even with all the bad events surrounding this album.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I resisted this film for years. I finally watched it with my girlfriend and couldn't believe what a terrific film it turned out to be. What can you say about Audrey Hepburn that hasn't been said in these reviews? She's not even my type and yet I still found her very sexy and beautiful. Gregory Peck was a perfect counterpart to her although he could be awkward in a couple of comedic moments. Still his sober approach fit better than that of the the great Cary Grant who, according to information, was initially tapped for the role. Grant would have upset the balance in this film just by his persona. Eddie Albert was a real pro and provided terrific support. I always found pomp and circumstance to be depressingly dull. The everyday life of the average person is much more desired in my opinion so I could appreciate what the princess was going through. The uncompromising ending really seals this film as a classic.
0684830515|5.0|Despite little plot and characters we never feel like we completely know, this is a remarkable book.  Its strengths lie in Hemmingway's clear, spare use of language, and in his ability to create a sense of place. A few thoughts... <br />  I've read that this book is semi-autobiographical. If that is true, Hemmingway seems to be revealing considerable self-loathing, even at this early stage in his career.  He was certainly capable of creating more noble characters than these! <br />  The alcohol consumption by the characters in this book is truly impressive.  I vacillated between wanting to go to Spain and stay drunk, and wanting to never drink again.  Brett also takes a lot of baths, but with her lifestyle, it's probably not a bad idea. <br />  Along with a sense of place, this book gives us a sense of time.  When but the 1920's could this group travel around Europe seemingly endlessly, never working but yet living quite well, despite frequent references to their lack of money?  If this novel were set in the present, Brett would be in treatment for sex addiction (and probably a few STDs as well), Romero would be battling PETA, Mike would be on a liver-transplant list, and Jake would be a spokesman for Viagra.
B000BNI95Y|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite CD's. My favorite song is Con mis manos.  It's a very upbeat song and very catchy.  All of the songs are great including her hit Malo.  Buy this CD!  You won't be sorry!

It is the missing piece to this puzzle that will complete what you are hoping for.  I wanted the old Floyd sound,and after hearing Island Jam, I found it.  Second favortie, \\"Then I close my eyes\\" ATTENTION DAVID GILMOUR!  PLEASE TOUR MORE!!!!  LIKE IN THE SOUTH!!!  US ALL LIKE YOU TOO!!!
B0001O3YD0|5.0|THIS ITEM GOT HERE DAYS BEFOR THEY SAID AND IN GOOD SHAPE
0385720920|4.0|In this novel Palahniuk creates a new character that is, once again, very unique.  Our hero, Victor Mancini is a young man living every day of his life only to satisfy his most basic (and sexual) needs.  Victor chokes in restaurants and makes himself the a helpless lamb, allowing anyone one to be his hero and help him.  He has done this a countless number of times and continues to recieve money from the people who save him.   <br />While I don't want to give away the plot, I will refute some of the more popular accusations made against this book: <br />1.  The characters seem unreal and you don't develop a real care for them. <br /> <br />To this I say that the book should be read quickly.  The character development may not be great, but that is not the point of a satire. <br /> <br />2.  The plot is unbelievable. <br /> <br />Yes, this is also pretty much true.  But once again this is a satire.  I'm pretty sure that Jonathan Swift didn't seriously intend for people to eat babies. <br /> <br />3.  This is the same style as chuck's other novels <br /> <br />Yes,  authors tend to write similar styles over anad over again.  Unfortunately this lack of versatility is probably Palahniuk's downfall. <br /> <br />In Conclusion:  This book does not have loveable characters or a great plot.  It will most likely not be considered a classic or 21st century literature.  Palahniuk does however manage to satarize christianity and religion, in general, to create a novel that is absolutely hillarious full of his typical \\"chuckism's\\".
B00005JOFQ|4.0|This was deleted somehow, so I am re-entering it.<br /><br />Ennis, the Taciturn Blond Guy, is the center of this movie. He says that he is not gay, and he is not gay. He is damaged, and cannot love anyone. For Ennis, love is a post traumatic stress disorder. As a child, his father had forced him to see a freshly murdered and mutilated gay guy- freshly enough killed that Dad might have been a material witness, at least. Then, Ennis' parents died in a car crash, and Ennis was raised indifferently by his sister. By the time we meet handsome, fit Ennis at age 21 or so, he has never had sex.<br /><br />He accepts his first love from Jack, who is gay. Ennis craves affection from Jack, but can give nothing back- no loving commitment. Is it because of viewing the murder victim, which would symbolize societal oppression of gay love? Well, Ennis cannot love his wife or kids, either. When Ennis goes away with Jack for phony fishing trips, he brings no fish or other gifts home for his kids, or his wife. What loving man would disrespect his children so, let alone his wife? Ennis favors Jack not because Ennis is gay, but because Jack will love him without requiring commitment.<br /><br />Jack gives up trying to make a life with Ennis, and finds some one else. Jack is murdered, as Ennis learns when he tries to arrange another secret rendezvous. Ennis' response to the horrid news is shock, loss, and grief- but NOT remorse or regret. Ennis does not say that if he had loved Jack as he might have, Jack would not have died. Ennis feels enormous loss, but no guilt or shame.<br /><br />As far as we can tell, and unlike what is the case with Jack, Ennis has no gay sex- and maybe no sex- after his divorce with anyone except Jack.<br /><br />After Jack dies, Ennis visits Jack's childhood home, where he encounters Jack's stereotyped, gay son-producing parents. Father is cold, and resentful of Jack and Mother's closeness. \\"He thought he was too good to be buried with us\\", says Dad. Warm and understanding Mom leads Ennis to Jack's bedroom, where Ennis finds the shirt Jack stole from him decades ago hanging with Jack's Jacket. Mom lets Ennis take the package, sending her son's loving soul home with Ennis.<br /><br />This is not a gay movie, making a case that gay love is better than any other, but only makes the case that gay love is as real as any other. As in many other movies featuring a gay character, the gay guy must die to satisfy the audience.<br /><br />I believe the movie is a hit because this is not a gay movie, and because as in traditional movies, the gay guy is punished with death.<br /><br />This is a movie about whether or not a man- Ennis- can love.<br /><br />My favorite scene is toward the end, when Ennis is admiring the numbers on his mailbox. He has an address, so he must exist! As is true on the internet, however, an address may not represent a real identity. Ennis has no identity- he can identify with no one, until at last he consents to go to the wedding of his daughter, who is nicknamed Junior.ds Ennis to Jack's bedroom, where Ennis finds the shirt Jack stole from him decades ago hanging with Jack's Jacket.

B000063DFN|5.0|It just doesn't get any better.  Dickinson at his best, the band playing tight as ever, if you don't like Maiden then there's something wrong with you - seriously!  Powerslave delivers some fantastic tunes - just listen to the build up on Aces High - what a chorus!  One thing I love about this album is it represents a fantastic historical era for the world's greatest band and they wrote music that trancsended the era.  These songs never grow old although you can hear them as representitive of yesterday - same with Piece of Mind - two completely fantastic awesome albums I could go on and on....Musically this stuff comes from an era when listeners demanded melodious brilliance as well as heavy drops - unlike a lot of 'loud' groups around now...Make sure you own this - NOW
B000EF5NAS|5.0|Have you ever watched a movie so many times, that it becomes embedded into you? You know every line and all the characters, as if it had all really happened to your life? Fried Green Tomatoes is one of those movies for me. Also, I think you will be surprised at the \\"real\\" connections my family has to the film.<br /><br />Fannie Flag wrote a book about a peculiar little town called whistlestop. The newspaper has a fit about a comet falling from the sky, and all of the locals are in a dither. I live not ten minutes from there. It's in Irondale Alabama. Just a few months ago I ate in the cafe again. Its a neat place with home cooked vegitables and your choice of two meats. (Big spenders add pie.)<br /><br />My Aunt Ida Hathcock was one of the afore mentioned peculiar citizens. She had some whopper stories, let me tell you. But according to her, all true. Crazy bulls that pinned people to walls - fireblazin' preachers that saw the world as the lake of fire, judging at will - (While they cheated on their wives behind the church). She was a hoot. I say all that to say, she knew the original characters Miss Flagg wrote the book about... Moonshine and all. How few are the treasured stories that remain.<br /><br />The Film is one of my favorites. And is easily the best \\"chick-flick\\" ever made in my opinion. Thats not just because of my relation to the stories, I had seen the movie atleast twenty times before the connection was made about Aunt Ida.<br /><br />Ninny is a lady in a nursing home that sees poor Evelyn crying her eyes out on the flower patterned love-seat, looking aweful, scarfing down candy bars. Ninny, seeing an opportunity to help the poor woman, sinks the hook of a great story, leading Evelyn to pry deeper. Ninny, \\"Just sit there, and I'll tell you all about it.\\" Murder, conspiracy, true love amongst friends, racism, loss and hope are just a few subjects skimming the surface of this wonderful tale. I love it.<br /><br />I could write a book, scene by scene, on the different takes and angles I have on this film. But, now is not the day for that. I'll think about that tomorrow. (-S.O.)<br /><br />If there is one great moral to the story, it is the one that I have learned with my Great Aunt Ida. These people live, they have wonderful adventures, touch the world, then pass. In scripture it says to seek councel from the wise. Maybe listening to a few whopper tales wouldn't hurt either. (Sir Adam of Scots)by scene, on the different takes and angles I have on this film.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I discovered Firefly through a friend who bought these DVD's and soon after he took them back I saved up for a little while and bought them myself. <br /> <br />With great quality, intresting special features such as interviews, auditions, and never before aired episodes. <br /> <br />Overall this is a great buy and i urge anyone who wants the series or has a couple extra twenties in their account to grab it.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|As you can probably tell from the reviews here, this is an album you're very likely to love or hate. Myself, I love it. Fantastic, fantastic album. One of the best of 2005, I'd say. The songs are long, rambling and epic, drift between Spanish and English, and tell a disjointed story about the protagonists' search for his birth parents. Every song/segment is amazingly fun to listen to and shows tons of genuine talent. So why 4 out 5? Well, the ambiance got to me. Many of the tracks have very long (2+ minutes) periods of nonmusical ambient noise to \\"set mood\\". Apparently the title track, Frances the Mute (now available as part of a single) wouldn't fit on the album due to length constraints. Frankly, we probably could have fit that entire 14:41 onto the CD if it weren't for the excessively long noise interludes. In fact, the track itself would be less than 14:41 without all of its own noise interludes. In conclusion, I call on all prog-rock/experimental types to GO BUY THIS ALBUM. RIGHT NOW. Just be aware that those noise segments are there. Let 'em play through, and you'll be on to amazing music again soon enough. The disc is still well worth your money. Long live The Mars Volta.
B00076NYFU|5.0|With HELLO, Status Quo delivers another great album of hard-driving blues-boogie that's equally good for dancing to or exercising to. Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt are great on guitars and vocals, singing rather than screaming, and while Rossi can't match Paul Rodgers, Derek St. Holmes, early Sammy Hagar, or Dave Peverett for soul, at least he's more pleasant to listen to than a guy like say, Kevin Dubrow, and has a wonderful sense of how to properly phrase a lyric. The band continues on the strong path begun with PILEDRIVER, proving that it's doubly unfair that the Quo never made it big over here. The band members' belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since last spring on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|I just watched this movie last night, and I was watching it ALONE. The beginning was a little corny, but there are big scares intertwined throughout. And the end was a little on the predictable side. But it was a great scary movie. I was jumpy all night after that one, especially when I was turning out the lights for the night. I give this movie a BIG thumbs up. I say go ahead and rent it if you could handle the Sixth Sense, or Stir of Echoes. You won't be disappointed.
B000002UAU|5.0|Este es uno de los m&aacute;s grandes albumes en la historia de la m&uacute;sica. Musicalmente The Beatles se encontraban en el pico m&aacute;s alto de su creatividad, lejos de la histeria de las fans, lejos de la cr&iacute;tica de una sociedad conservadora como la americana, quienes los criticaban por corromper su juventud, los juzgaban por blasfemar y decir que eran m&aacute;s populares que JesusCristo. Pero era cierto, en 1966 ellos eran mas populares que cualquiera en el mundo. Pero gracias a esa gente escandalizada que se razgaban las vestiduras por tama&ntilde;a insolencia, ellos se apartaron de las giras, los conciertos y se encerraron en Abbey Road para dar rienda suelta a su genialidad, a su talento. Sgt. Pepper es la prueba irrefutable que ellos no necesitaban de \\"ni&ntilde;itas\\" gritando al borde de la locura para demostrarle al mundo que ellos eran genios de su &eacute;poca y l&iacute;deres de una generaci&oacute;n. De este &aacute;lbum se ha escrito hasta el hartazgo. S&oacute;lo puedo decir que a pesar de haber nacido despu&eacute;s de la ruptura de los Beatles y cerca a la muerte del \\"maestro\\", John Lennon, este &aacute;lbum cambio mi vida la primera vez que lo compr&eacute; en el a&ntilde;o 1997, 30 a&ntilde;os despues de su lanzamiento. Lo he escuchado tantas veces que me he visto en la necesidad de comprarlo otra vez, y lo seguir&eacute; haciendo hasta cuando tenga 64 y m&aacute;s, en los nuevos formatos por venir, porque este &aacute;lbum es inmortal como sus cradores, porque no habr&aacute; canci&oacute;n tan alucinante como Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds, no habr&aacute; canci&oacute;n m&aacute;s optimista que Getting Better o With a Little Help From My Friends, no habr&aacute; melod&iacute;a mas bella que She's Leaving Home o When I'm Sixty-Four, no habr&aacute; canci&oacute;n tan impactante como Within You, Without You, no habr&aacute; cancion tan perfecta como A day In The Life con un final excepcional. Desde la portada hasta las notas musicales que emite el disco, este es y seguir&aacute; siendo la obra maestra del grupo de rock mas grande de todos los tiempos.
B000E6EJAC|5.0|This marvelous remaster of \\"All the Young Dudes\\" supercedes the British release of a couple of years ago. That version beautifully remastered by Ray Staff is captured here with the addition of bonus tracks taken from the \\"All the Young Dudes Anthology\\" and \\"2 Miles from Heaven\\". These include demo versions of \\"One of the Boys\\", \\"Black Scorpion\\" (a demo for \\"Moma's Little Jewel\\" at a brisker pace)and \\"Ride on the Sun\\" (a demo for \\"Sea Diver\\"). We also get an \\"audiomorph\\" of Bowie's unfinished demo of \\"Dudes\\" cross faded and mixed with Hunter's vocal version effectively creating a duet of sorts. This also was available on the \\"Dudes\\" anthology. Additionally we get the 45 edit for \\"One of the Boys\\" and live tracks drawn from the UK 2 disc release of \\"Live\\" (which was recorded two years after this album but that's a minor point. It would, however, have been better to release this with bonus tracks recorded by the original line up from the 1972-3 tour).<br /><br />We also get liner notes discussing the making of the album but no song lyrics. There were other bonus tracks that could have been included from the band's years at Columbia. Those are, however, available on the limited edition \\"Dudes\\" anthology. Columbia has done a terrific job repackaging this 35th anniversary edition (that's if we're counting from the band's first release in 1969).<br /><br />Just before the band recorded this album they had experienced three years of fruitless releases and were ready to break up. Every album they had made had been met with public indifference despite critical acclaim. Then along came David Bowie. He helped the band refashion itself into a glam rock band. Bowie streamlined their sound a bit but, more importantly, he came with a potential hit single he had written himself. The band turned down the first song offered (opinions differ as to what it was) but did accept the second which Hunter and the rest of Mott recognized would fit their sound. \\"Dudes\\" is one of the band's best albums (along with \\"Brain Capers\\" and \\"Mott\\")catching them just as they were reenergized by Bowie's involvement.with \\"Brain Capers\\" and \\"Mott\\")catching them just as they were reenergized by Bowie's involvement.
B000AYEI5Y|1.0|Sorry James, but this CD stinks! I really loved the song \\"You're beautiful\\" on the radio and I wanted to buy the CD.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|\\"On An Island\\" features the type of music that Pink Floyd and David Gilmour fans have come to expect from the man--there's lots of moody, atmospheric playing, Gilmour's memorable raspy vocals and some of the best material he's written in years. Collaborating with guitarist/songwriter Phil Manzanera of Roxy Music and veteran producer Chris Thomas (The Pretenders), Gilmour has crafted an atmospheric album full of hazy instrumentals and songs that may not rock out the way fans are used to but are still filled with passion and emotion. By the way, if you decide not to buy this locally some retail outlets are offering a bonus disc that includes an additional song. How does this compare to his other solo albums? Well each one represented a different decade in Gilmour's life so they are all quite different and difficult to compare but the quality of the songwriting is top notch here as on those. This effort is a little more focused than his first (\\"David Gilmour\\") and a little less commercial than his second (\\"About Face\\").<br /><br />Written solo and in collaboration with Polly Samson (a journalist and writer who wrote some of the lyrics for \\"The Division Bell\\" as well as Mrs. Gilmour)providing words on most of the tracks \\"On An Island\\" features a wide variety of memorable guest players (Floyd's Richard Wright, David Crosby & Graham Nash on backing vocals, Jools Holland formerly of Squeeze, Robert Wyatt and--surprisingly--guitarist Phil Manzanera playing keyboards). I'll be the first to admit that Samson isn't Waters as a lyricist but her words are servicable for the songs and occasionally inspired (hence the four stars and not five). The production by Gilmour, Manzanera and Thomas is atmospheric providing the perfect sonic backdrop for Gilmour to do what he does best--play and sing.<br /><br />\\"On An Island\\" does allows Gilmour to experiment a bit as well with the material but what's most interesting as how emotionally direct the songs are. Clearly no man's an island and that's true of Gilmour as well--he works well with his collaborators building a sonic home on this solo album. The album does have flaws for example the pacing is a bit turgid at times and truly it would have helped to have a solid hard rock number here to break through the haze on the album but overall it's a terrific effort and a worthy follow up to his work leading Floyd and solo efforts. It's a shame we had to wait for so long Gilmour to assert himself on record again but it was well worth the wait. David, don't make us wait another decad! Oh, by the way, happy birthday!Gilmour as well--he works well with his collaborators building a sonic home on this solo album.

B00000DC4A|5.0|I have been a fan of Bryan Adams since he first blew onto the scene in the 80's.   I can still remember blasting the album 'Reckless' on my boombox endlessly into the night.  Sure it was pure pop, but it STILL rocks like no tommorow and nobody served it up better.    Flash forward to the late 90's, and Bryan quietly releases 'On A Day Like Today', which bombs commercially and vanishes off the charts without a whisper.  It was a real shame, as most people missed out on one of the most refreshing, introspective, and melodic albums he has ever produced.      What defines this CD, was the level of maturity and strong songwriting.  Bryan really set the bar high for himself on this disc and he doesn't disappoint.   The album seamlessly blends a wonderful mixture of ballads, rock and roll, and mid tempo songs. Stand out tracks are 'Inside Out', 'If I Had You', and 'One A Day Like Today', 'Getaway', 'Before The Night Is Over', and the cream of the crop, 'Cloud Number Nine'.       Don't miss this overlooked treasure!
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|One of my favorite all time classics. Had to have it in my library of films.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|First off, I like the series.  <br />The greatest loss to TV since god knows what else? No and if you really believe that you need to either get out more or at least watch something else on TV as well. <br /> <br />I will agree that it is bloody good fun though. The characters are starting to develop it's amusing at all the right times, a blend of escapism without going too far out. Kind of reminds me of some of the older sci-fi stuff from a few years ago (Blakes 7 anyone? or am I dating myself too much?) <br /> <br />Anyway, there are 2 quibbles that stop me giving this 5 stars: <br />1) Some of the endings are a bit on the \\"oh, is that it?\\" side - a good build up then it feels like they gave up and went for the easy out. Relates more to the first few episodes really. <br />2) The DVD layout - why o why, when almost all the other series DVD's have a 'play all' option on the menu, does this one make you select an episode, wait for another cut segment to play and another menu to load, then make you hit play again followed by another cut segment? I know, I know, not the worst thing in the world but after a few times it is REALLY annoying when a little thought could have made life easier all round rather than breaking up the flow of the DVD so much. <br /> <br />Overall, it gets 4 stars because the annoyance above make 5 too much.
B000CBO04E|3.0|I bought this CD and was immediately disappointed by the packaging--the outside is OK, but the inside cover is a blurry photocopy of the original LP cover, and you can't even read the information in places.  When I listened to it, I found that the music is garishly boosted in volume, with what sounds like digital distortion in at least one place.  It's  EQ'd somewhat better than the Columbia US release, but the bass is boomy much of the time, and the dynamic range is somewhat squashed. <br /> <br />In addition, it has a registry error at what is supposed to the beginning of \\"Three Friends\\"--which is actually the middle of \\"Mr. Class and Quality\\".  This is the same error that is on the Columbia CD, and both CDs have the same overall length--which has led experts on a mastering forum to conclude that this CD was likely remastered with the 16-bit Columbia CD as the source, rather than the original tape! <br /> <br />For over $30, this is not a proper remaster in any sense of the word.  Although it sounds better than the Columbia CD, I recommend that GG fans hold out for a proper remaster in the near future, rather than buy this inferior product.
B000069I5W|4.0|Showtime brings to the screen the pairing up of two police officers recruited to take part in a reality, Cops-like, TV show.  <br />Robert De Niro, Eddie Murphy, Rene Russo, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows, allowing for a highly entertaining movie. <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all very good. <br />In short, though not a masterpiece it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment. <br />
B000BM3ZUE|5.0|For those who aren't familiar, this album is GG's second, and the last of their Crimso-influenced prog period--with \\"serious\\" lyrics, mellotrons, classical themes, etc.  It wasn't until the next album that the band began to find its unique polyphonic groove--a process that achieved fruition on the fourth album, \\"Octopus\\", with the arrival of John Weathers on drums. <br /> <br />As a died-in-the-wool GG fanatic, I always devalued this album a bit--the drummer, and the music, is rather ponderous relative to the \\"serious fun\\" they generated in later releases, and its chromatic textures have always sounded a little \\"gray\\" to me.  However, their allusions to 20th century music (like Schoenberg, Webern, and Bartok) were a refreshing contrast to the classical and romantic references of most other prog bands, and admittedly it is a VERY adventurous album, even for Gentle Giant.  <br /> <br />However, this remaster has awakened me to the beauty of this music.  Rather than applying contemporary pop remastering techniques as many reissues do, Repertoire has reapproached this music with a subtle reverent hand appropriate for classical music, with outstanding results.  The \\"gray\\" in the music has turned to pastel shades, and the delicacy of the original production is evident as never before.  Tracks that I didn't appreciate earlier--such as the mystical, dissonant tone poems \\"Edge of Twilight\\" and \\"The Moon Is Down\\"--are now revealed in all their fragile detail.  It is a flat out lovely job of remastering, and the end product is a definitive version that fills a gap in both my CD collection, and in my appreciation of this marvelous band. <br /> <br />It may not be my absolute favorite of their records, but it is truely unlike any album done by this band or any other that I know of.  If you've always loved this album, then you must have it.  If you love this band, but like me never appreciated this album fully, you probably should too.  Simply put, it is progressive music that truely lives up to that label, and sounds as unique and daring as it did then.    <br />  <br />

B00005JOFO|1.0|...it was simply a much better movie. So please, everyone stop analyzing why Brokeback Mountain didn't win. It was overlong, boring, cliched, predictable, and had NO character development. <br /> <br />Everyone saw two men in love. I saw two men in lust who had NO REASON to marry and ruin the lives of their wives and children. You saw a beautiful consumation of their love. I saw two men brutally raping each other, loving it, and coming back for more. <br /> <br />I'm a gay man. I hated Brokeback Mountain. So did my boyfriend. And I'm very glad Crash beat it for Best Picture. So is he. This was offensive to homosexuals and depicted them as sexual predators. And of course, in Hollywood, all gay men have to be killed off somehow, right? They can't just live normal, happy lives like we do in real life.  <br /> <br />Please people, see the big picture here. This isn't the great gay love story everyone is making it out to be. It's a Hollywood version of a gay romance that is wrong and offensive. GO CRASH!!!
B000089CPF|5.0|i'm not sure what the reviewer scott taylor listens to (and music is a vey personal thing, like religion i guess), but in my mind this is one the finest, most creative, hauntingly beautiful, and wonderfully mesmerizing albums i have heard in a long time. 'black heart' is a killer. please check out the dvd also if you have not seen them live. they are daring, challenging and diverse. some of my other favorites that exceed musical boundaries are coltrane, hendrix, miles, king crimson etc. so, judge for yourself, but give this one a chance if you truly love creative music.
078324228X|2.0|The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter. <br /> <br />The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty. <br /> <br />The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them. <br /> <br />I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups. <br /> <br />The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title \\"hero,\\" would you still rate it highly? <br /> <br />If your answer is \\"yes,\\" then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid. <br /> <br />Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar. <br /> <br />Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.  <br /> <br />I'm not counting on that, though.
B00097A5I6|1.0|For much of the 90's Oasis was my favorite band.  I saw them live from the early Tony MCCarroll on drums days through this summer.  WTSMG is one of the best CD's of all time and I personally like Definitely Maybe even better.  I devoured their singles and excused the hiccup that was Be Here Now. <br /> <br />A few years ago Oasis released their 4th record Standing on the Shoulder of Giants.  Outstanding CD but panned by many.  It was sometime during this period that original members Bonehead and Quigsy left the band.  I think it was also the period where Noel cleaned up his act. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the 5th Album Heathen Chemistry was poor and now Oasis has hit rock bottom.  This CD is just brutal - no fire, no passion, just sounds like a bunch of guys going through the motions.  The only track that even sounds like old Oasis is A Bell Will Ring. <br /> <br />Liam Gallagher did not take care of his voice - if you do not believe me listen to the early recordings - he sang back then.  Now he rasps his way through all the songs.   <br /> <br />I never thought I would give Oasis a bad review and I will continue to buy anything they put out in hopes of a return to form but this is not it.
B000002VMH|5.0|I never stopped loving this album after 14 years of listening to it. Why? Because it's just simply amazing music. The opening track \\"Why\\" is a stunning song with beautiful atmospherics and angsty lyrics. Her voice is incredible and the songs back it up!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Great DVD.  Lots of music for the money.  Nice to have playing in the background at a party ...
B0006SSOHC|4.0|I had been told by a few people who had seen the movie that it was laughable and in no way frightening, yet other reviews here on Amazon seemed to speak from a different standpoint.  So, as a true fan of terror on film, I had to judge for myself.<br /><br />I found the plot to be quite creative and intriguing.  The scenarios Jigsaw stages are intricate, alarming and bizarre- leaving his victims to make terrifying choices in order to survive his \\"game\\".<br /><br />At the opening to this movie, you are thrown straight into the thick of things.  The movie begins with two men chained to pipes in a dilapidated room, with a dead man lying in the middle of the floor.  The story then slowly and deliberately begins to unravel, with each man ultimately learning why he is there.  Danny Glover is introduced soon after as an investigator on the Jigsaw case.  Cary Elwes surprised me in this role, showing a far darker side than he's ever before revealed on-screen.<br /><br />The movie is suspenseful and interesting, with a good and somewhat startling ending.  It turned out to be far better than I was told it would be.  I'm glad I decided to see for myself.
0767812166|4.0|Sure, you can watch a movie that is mostly state-of-the-art special effects, but how about some good acting, a catchy story, and the opportunity to use your own mind for suspension of belief. Starman, if watched very closely, is a sweet story with a lot to say about human kind. The themes addressed are ever more relevant today. The big question I came away with was,\\" Gee! Why do we have to get old? \\" <br />Boydarino
B000BJS4TO|4.0|I appreciated a great soundtrack from Yo-Yo Ma. It's a subtle pleasure listen this music with the soul of the orient in our european mood. The music caught the spirit and the essence of the movie. It's hard to feel the geishas world. It's very simple to identifie them with \\"easy girls\\". They are the opposite. If You don't live or know the Japanese culture, You can't understand who is a geisha. The music from Yo-Yo Ma can guide You into this magic world
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Is This It has proved to be a blessing and a curse for the New York boys.  Everything that they have done since its release is always weighted with the hype of the records \\"Rock and Roll Saving\\" characteristics.  For critics there is no way to go but down (Consider the plight of Pearl Jam after their release of Ten)... I mean, you can't save rock and roll twice.  So I try my hardest not to pay attention to the hype (positive or negative) when they release a new album.  I could care less what Rolling Stone or Spin have to say, I'm always excited to get a new album from one of my few beloved bands. <br /> <br />So, without any more lead-in, I love this album.  Love it, Love it, Love it.  The Strokes have seemingly put actual effort into recording an album and in my opinion it tops both previous; and I thought they were great. (I can already hear all of the hipsters screaming: The Strokes are so 2001.) People will continue to say that it's all stolen material, but all bands have influences... The Strokes just happen to have great ones.  The guitar work has gotten complicated and beautiful.  I loved all of the little guitar breaks on the past two albums and felt like there could have been a few more measures; and it's all here on First Impressions.  Julian's lyrics and voice are as always great, skewed and drunkenly emotional (even though he has apparantly gotten off the sauce).  True the first half of the album is obviously better, but none of the tracks on the last half are worth skipping, and certain ones (Ize of the World comes to mind) will have you hitting the repeat button well, repeatedly.  Even people who weren't particularly amazed at the first two albums should find at least one track that they will be playing relentlessly on their i-Pod. <br /> <br />So get First Impressions and let's all hope for a memorable fourth,fifth,sixth,and seventh albums; not a repeat of Pearl Jam who made great albums after but couldn't live up to the hype of Ten. Or, you can go with the critics new toy and pick up a copy of the White Stripes (the new saviors of rock and roll) \\"Get Behind Me Satan\\" and convince yourself that it's genius.  GOod Luck.
B000E8N690|4.0|This story I found to be an entertaining account, if not fully accurate, of Johnny Cash's life. The movie depicts June as the reason his first marriage broke up. It wasn't.<br /><br />There is another scene in the movie where he finds a cabin in the woods, and not a single mention of the fact that the night he found it, he nearly died and that was how he found God, which as most know, he was very religious at least in his later years.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix were both outstanding and deservedly Oscar winners (or nominees as in Phoenix's case).<br /><br />One thing I noticed is that Johnny Cash has a certain tone to his voice where you can tell what he sings comes from his gut (for lack of a prettier word), Joaquin Phoenix was not able to duplicate it exactly, but he had a very similar quality which was great.<br /><br />Overall the movie about Johnny Cash's life is worth seeing at least once. Just don't believe the adultery part.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I really enjoy this movie and it was a great adventure to watch.
B00020HEL6|5.0|It's very rare to hear such wonderful talent from such a young person.  Her voice is very strong for someone her age.  You will be truly impressed.  Her talent is very refreshing.  When she sings \\"Midnight At The Oasis\\", she just makes your mind just float away.  A true jazz lover will appreciate this.  You'll just sit back and smile.
0066620996|4.0|This book provides the conclusions of a research study undertaken to try and answer the question in the title. It includes plenty of hard data and methodology, but the bulk of it is conclusions and anecdotes.<br /><br />I personally felt that the material provided, at the very least, a new perspective to look at your business processes and see room for improvement. It seems like everyone today has a \\"MAKE MONEY FAST\\" solution to every company's problems, and this book includes some element of that. However, the real message is to look deeply into the real potential of your business for your future direction and to never waver from that path.<br /><br />I found the book easy to read, and I will probably look closely at the author's past and future publications for more information as well.
1400049628|4.0|The Zombie Survival Guide is a fun, interesting read.  Is it funny, though?  Not really.  At least I didn't think it was.  The only reason that I enjoyed reading it so much is because I am a huge fan of the zombie genre.  Whether it is books, movies, or video games, if it involves zombies in any way, you can bet I own it.  Therefore, everything that Max Brooks fits into his guide to surviving a world filled with the undead is something that I could truly appreciate and smile at.  I never really laughed out loud, though.  I guess that the only reason that I found this book in the humor sections is because there is really no other section to place it in.  For any reader who just picks it up because it sounds interesting, I doubt that they will be happy with the result.  For anyone who is a George Romero fan, though, will love this book.  Reading this book made we want to watch the Living Dead films all over again, right in a row.  I don't know if Max Brooks was just trying to be funny, or if he actually appreciates the zombie genre, but his book fits in perfectly with everything you've seen on film before, and expands on it to an insane degree.  The best part of the book is how seriously it takes itself.  I'm sure it could have been a lot funnier if Brooks didn't write the book like we were actually living in an undead world as he wrote it.  The book is completely serious about itself, and, therefore, it is really only funny in the ironic sense.
0977326403|3.0|I think that this monograph is useful material for public sector, non-profit, or secular organizations. It presents some useful points that extend the Good to Great concepts to organizations that are not profit-driven.<br /><br />My largest complaint is that the current price is not consistent with the amount of material. Good to Great is an excellent value, while this additional monograph is roughly a single additional chapter at over half the price.
B0000029LG|5.0|You can pretty much break the tracks on these discs down the middle ... 1979-91, when Michael Jackson was a poor black boy (disc I) ... and 1992-1996, when he'd completely morphed into a rich white woman, straight hair, high-pitched voice, eccentricities 'n all. <br /> <br />As far as Greatest Hits compilations, Disc I is probably the best ever ... you'll get every one of his classic, masterpiece tracks on this disc: <br /> <br />\\"Bad,\\" \\"Billie Jean,\\" \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',\\" \\"Rock Wit You,\\" \\"The Girl is Mine,\\" \\"P.Y.T.,\\" \\"She's Out of My Life\\" ... just absolute masterpieces. <br /> <br />I was a very young kid when Michael was at the absolute heighth of his superpowers (circa 1982-85) and he'll always be the biggest 1980s icon to me. <br /> <br />If you're a fan a kinder/gentler MJ times -- pre-sexual molestation/identity crisis MJ, trust me, and skip disc two! <br /> <br />That disc has songs I almost can't even remember or just bare to listen to.   <br /> <br />Disc 2 really serves more as a visual aid in how MJ had totally lost touch in a number of important ways. <br /> <br />Buy this album, but don't expect a quality 2-disc product.
0307276902|3.0|A story of the long and disturbing twists of life that can lead to a life of drug addiction.  This book also describes the difficut road of recovery.  It seemed a bit long to really get into the reasons behind James Frey's addictions and his recovery and once his got to the meat of his recovery, the book was over.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|After years of bitterness over Roger Waters' unilateral decision to disband Pink Floyd -- reflected in the lyrics of post-Waters Floyd -- it sounds like David has finally made peace with it.  Now content to \\"go it alone,\\" a human island as it were, he is making a trial escape from the pressures and expectations of legions of rabid PF fans.<br /><br />Consequently this album is distinctly unFloydlike.  Oh sure, his guitar and voice will always recall PF since he was so much a foundation of their sound -- but on \\"Island\\" the song structures are of a different scale from the grand anthems of PF.  These songs are smaller, simpler, more rural, more of a personal scale, sounding maybe even like they were written and performed on a houseboat.  It's a less-ambitious undertaking.<br /><br />I'm not even sure \\"more personal\\" is accurate -- he says Polly Sampson wrote all the lyrics, which are entirely emotionally neutral: observational, almost meaningless word images.<br /><br />\\"More personal\\" perhaps in the sense that he is finally freed from the past, released from bitterness, free to create music of his own choice for the first time in a long time.  His relief and comfort are palpable.<br /><br />And also the reason for only four stars.  After 22 years since his last solo album -- and 12 since the last PF collaboration -- you'd think he'd have a folio of stronger songs than these.  These all feel like 'B' songs which didn't make the cut for earlier albums.  If you imagine them without the singing and soaring guitar leads, there's not much left.<br /><br />It's almost as if he's daring you to compare him to PF, as Lennon did after washing his hands of the Beatles.
B00030590I|4.0|i was surprised with 'Hero' bacause i usually don't care for the typical epic 'wire-fu' chinese movies - that take themselves way too seriously and are visually self-indulgent. 'Hero' does this too but the movie in the end has a good heart behind it - one of peace - a man's (a hero's) journey toward harmony with himself and his fellow man.    the movie 'The Last Samurai' could learn alot from this movie ('Hero') and the characters in it, Broken Sword and the warrior named Nameless. well, i suppose we all could. what i mean by that is that 'Hero' is not just a visual feast, but an interesting movie that may make you think about life. in it's own way 'Hero' gives us some light at the end - some kind of peace of heart and a better way to live.    now 'Hero' does not presents us with easy choices. but the choice or discovery of the truth of being at one with yourself and others is there for all of us to make.     peace and cheers!
B000B8QEZG|3.0|It's really interesting that Madonna is sexier now that she's older and wears MORE clothes. At any rate, I didn't really know what to expect from her after she delivered the bizarre American Life. But this time around, it looks like Ms. Ciccone -- I mean, Mrs. Ritchie went for a hit-or-miss approach: the concept album.<br /><br />As evidenced by the album's title, Confessions On a Dance Floor is all about being on the dance floor. But I don't know if I necessarily agree with the reviewers that say this digs back into her early `80s style. Back then, she made songs that you COULD hear in the club; here, she's making songs that you'd ONLY hear in the club. But the songs are still good; the singles \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Sorry\\" are easily standouts.<br /><br />Another good song is \\"Isaac\\" with its Middle Eastern vibe. But there are still a few missteps, like \\"Get Together\\" and \\"I Love New York\\". And sorry, but \\"Push\\" feels more like a generic remake of \\"Like a Prayer\\" than a sequel. Everything else is good enough to get you on your feet, but to be honest, this album would be best enjoyed by people that own every volume of Fired Up. I'm not sure true Madonna fans will be able to appreciate Confessions On a Dance Floor, so let's still hope that she goes back to her roots for her next album.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
0553584537|3.0|It was an interesting story but a so so book.  The characters were awkward.  They were stereotypes.  The conclusions about persons who have been victims of sexual abuse made me uncomfortable.  It will make a great film though.  I might  read another from this author. <br />
B000E6UK5K|5.0|First off, I have the whole cataloge of PF.  Through Syd To Dave..and the roger stuff between... all good.<br /><br />I, however, must say that I have always been a fan of a distinct cut of PF's material, mainly:<br /><br />1. Obscured by Clouds<br /><br />2.  Meddle<br /><br />3.  Dark Side of the Moon<br /><br />4.  Wish You Were Here<br /><br />5.  Division Bell<br /><br />I really enjoy PF when PF is slow and majestic... and DG and RW work it together... when DG and RW combine the guitar and hammond organs, it is magic.<br /><br />SO, having said that... I was pretty excited to hear that DG's new CD had a 'mellow' tone to it.  And they were right.<br /><br />Now don't get too upset if you hate mellow, because mellow has a rotten name with a lot of crap mellow artist out there -past and present- but Dave's voice was made for mellow 'dope' singing.  He just really hits it on all gears as he sings softly and then breaks into a guitar soar.<br /><br />Not for everyone.  Those folks that like the Roger Water screaming of THE WALL/ANIMALS (great CD's by the way) may not like this outing.  And that is okay.  But, I just wanted people to know that the songs are fantastic, and they flow into each other, and RW guests on two of the songs.. .<br /><br />I suggest busting open some red wine, and putting this on with the lights low and relax... this is the perfect CD to do it with.<br /><br />Enjoy and Have fun
0743267478|5.0|I purchased this book sight unseen through a book club. When I received it and saw that it was written by an Indian and took place in Indian, some ingrained prejudice told me that I would hate it. But I decided to read it anyway and I couldn't put it down. This is probably one of the best books that I have read in a long time and I can't recommend it enough! The book says that it's going to made into a movie and I can't wait!
0393327655|5.0|This book should be read not only by every American, but everyone able to read.  It is so enlightening and realistic relative to what we're all up against, that it should be given away free by the governments of every country in the world.
B00004U2GH|5.0|Most people know about this album and rightly so, as Cash really delivers somthing special here.  Throughout the recording not only does Cash perform his songs exactly as you would expect but his personality really shines as he banters with the prison inmates.  It is clear from this album alone why Johnny Cash was so popular with all sorts of people.  In between songs he jokes around, tells brief stories and, most importantly, connects with his audience.  You can tell he has their full support all the way as they cheer and clap during just about every song. <br /> <br />Standout songs are Boy Named Sue, Folsom Prison Blues, Ring of Fire, the Closing Medley and of course San Quentin.  The latter song being performed twice in a row to the request of the inmates who immediately love the song.  You can feel the prison guards anxiety as the song causes the inmates to get lively to the lyrics cursing everything about the walls that hold them in. <br /> <br />If you have never heard much Cash before then this isnt a bad place to start as it has a few of his more famous tracks.  If you have not heard Cash playing live then this is the perfect place to start.  For me this is better than Folsom Prison, thugh that is mainly due to tracklisting.  I would think most people would like some aspect of this album, you dont have to be a fan of country music in general (I am not) and nor do you have to know much about Johnny Cash.  You never know, if this is your first taste you may end up being a Johnny Cash fan for life.
B00005MCWZ|5.0|Perhaps you've heard of Hawkwind?  Perhaps you've heard a song or an album? Well, nothing beats this first disc, originally issued on vinyl in 1970.  Great on 'shrooms and hash brownies.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|David has given us something special. There is no doubt that after 18 years from his last solo album and nothing since the last Floyd Album (93) we have had a major dead spell by anyone from Floyd.     Well Dave is an older man and his talents have only aged like a fine wine. Sure he doesn't have rockin' out tunes like you find from the 70's but more an element of the age of all his works. This is a mellow album with the licks of his unmistakable and original guitar works. This is very much like a Floyd album without being one and if you are a fan of his or Pink Floyd, you will enjoy this. 20 years from now, you will uncork that bottle and enjoy it just as much..this is a timeless piece.
B000AL730O|5.0|<br />With this terrific new album, Paul McCartney proves that he's anything but dead. However, in the twilight of the Beatles' existence, a rumor swept the U.S. that Paul was, indeed, dead. This fascinating saga -- how it started, who started it, why it spread so rapidly, and what impact it had and continues to have on our culture -- is explored in the brand-new book, TURN ME ON, DEAD MAN by Andru J. Reeve. Now available right here at Amazon.com !    <br /> <br />Also, seek out the new Dutch documentary WHO BURIED PAUL MCCARNTEY? (don't worry; it's presented in English).  But, above all, be sure to pick up Paul's new CD \\"Chaos And Creation In the Backyard\\", because Paul is alive and well!  See for yourself, and let's all cheer Paul on to his 64th birthday and beyond!  <br />
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I have heard of Pink Floyd but I'm no fan.(mainly an R&B Hip-Hop fan) But I do love all, and I stress ALL types of music. I never heard of David Gilmour or any of the other folk that appear on this disc but it's beautiful none-the-less. My favorite is the title track, \\"The Blue\\", and \\"Take A Breath\\". It's very theatrical and I can imagine it being a soundtrack to a great movie. Listening to this CD makes me want to here some of his other work and also Pink Floyd's. I predict huge sales for this CD.
B000C3H4M2|1.0|Talking Heads, huh? Wow, does the music industry have eyes for talent.  <br /> <br />Fear of Music is right. This is anything but music, it's crap. <br /> <br />I await your harsh ratings.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|A young man,his best friend,and his girlfriend become addicted to illegal drugs while his own mother becomes addicted to diet pills and they all go from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows in this disturbing film.The basic flow of the movie has no huge surprises in where it's going but the surprises come in Darren Aronofsky's creative highly stylized direction.With sped up photography inventive nightmare sequences(The fridge that literally terrorizes Ellen Burstyn is scarier than anything she faced in the Exorcist)Aronofsky creates a trippy atmosphere.Fortunately the film isn't all style it features some incredible performances especially Jennifer Connelly's transformation from sexy girlfriend to soulless zombie and then there's Ellen Burstyn.In her Oscar nominated role as a lonely widow trying to lose weight to get on T.V. she's the tragic heart of the movie.You're almost afraid to see what will happen to her next yet you can't stop watching.The film builds to a climax more terrifying than any horror movie because you actually care what happens to these people in the end.The incredible music score by Clint Mansell and Kronos Quartet is the most intense score of the last 20 years(And stolen by many other movies for their commercials:Lord of the Rings,Zathura)Requiem for a Dream may have little gore but it's definitely not for the faint of heart.A terrific blend of style,music,and memorable performances make Requiem for a Dream arguably the A Clockwork Orange of the 21st century.You will be shaken.
B000BT97AO|3.0|Watching Mirror Mask I was continually stunned by the imaginative imagery.  Floating giants, monkey birds, a wicked queen and evil undulating tendrils are only a few of the marvels to be seen.  The film is just jam packed with other-worldly images and creatures.  It has a look unlike anything you've seen before.  For that alone Mirror Mask deserves high praise.<br /><br />However, the story and (to a lesser extent) characters are shallow and not fleshed out.  At the core of Mirror Mask is the relationship between a mother and a daughter, a relationship that I never fully understood or believed.  The emotions and situations of the characters were glossed over in order to give more screen time to the amazing visuals.<br /><br />It's sad really becuase many will never make it through the full film since it is so cold and therefore miss out on some of the most amazing imagery from a movie in decades.  With just a little more attention paid to the story and characters this could have been a masterpiece.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|This extended cut fills all the loose ends left of the first one.  It has a wonderful additional special footage.  The extended scenes are fabulous!  Ten times more the action, ten times more suspense, and ten times more romance.  \\"Underworld\\" has never been better.  This is an item worth having in your DVD collection.
B00005K3NR|3.0|Again, leave it to Stephen King to give us another great story. Sissy Spacek gives a wonderful performance as Carrie..... a girl with supernatural powers. Coming from an abusive home with a very strict mother, we feel sorry for Carrie. Especially on prom night when her fellow classmates, known to pick at her constantly, play a prank on her unleashing a rage in Carrie and her supernatural powers. Those who have treated her badly end up paying for being so mean to her. Good acting and good suspense. Will always be one of those movies that no one will forget.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|I've been a Floyd fan since a saucerful of secrets, and I can't help being offended by this person who calls himself a Floyd fan.  You claim David Gilmour never wrote any songs for Pink Floyd.  All you have to do is look at some of the record sleeves.  Or maybe you downloaded all of these albums.  Ever heard of comfortably numb?   Also, I believe once Roger left it became apparent what David brought to the sound of Pink Floyd.  In my opinion they both were essential to the overall music.    Anyway, to me this doesn't compare to either his last solo album which was excellent or the division bell, which had many good songs on it.
B00005O438|4.0|Another great story from Stephen King! Good thriller although not a horror movie. Dee Wallace Stone's character and her son find themselves trapped in her car at the home of a local mechanic who has worked on her car, however no one is home..... except for their \\"killer\\" dog Cujo! Great scenes, scares and thrills in this one. Good acting by everyone..... especially the Saint Bernard playing Cujo. A must see for Stephen King fans... although I'm sure every Stephen King fan has seen this movie by now. But even so, you don't have to be a S. King fan to enjoy Cujo!!!
B000089RV6|5.0|ACDC was a true classic rock band.  I haven't heard this album in years and I must admit it was like I had heard for the first time!  If you are a classic rock lover you will enjoy Back in Black.
0792846443|4.0|After reading the book Misery (yes, Stephen King delivers again!), I couldn't wait to see this movie. I did so as soon as it hit the theaters. Great show that does the book justice. Cathy Bates and James Caan give great performances. A well known bookwriter gets into a car crash and is rescued by his biggest fan. He is taken to  her home to recover from his injuries but finds out that his biggest fan is quite a disturbed woman who is now holding him captive in her isolated farm home forcing him to write a sequel to her favorite book. No horror here but good suspense. Very well done.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|When I rented the Rent DVD I was oblivious to any story, music and characters. I did know it was a Broadway show at one time. But that was about it. I sure was in for a surprise when I played this DVD.<br /><br />Rent takes a one year look into New York's East Village bohemians. These carefree artists face constant struggles during the late 1980s. The story's focus is on these two main characters; Mark (Anthony Rapp) an aspiring filmmaker that will just about anything that is not main stream and his roommate is Roger (Adam Pascal) an aspiring songwriter. Shuffle in the many friends who are intertwined in the story of love, sex, drugs, art and friendship.<br /><br />This DVD musical must be played with a Home Theatre System with Dolby Digital surround sound. The songs come alive with visual art portrayed by the actors/singers. The content hits the heart of its viewer. The dialog is crisp, clear and to the point when sung.<br /><br />The surprise for me is that I actually will add this DVD to my collection because of the songs. But now I actually know the story behind the music. I will always have Mimi (Rosario Dawson) in my mind during the \\"Out Tonight\\" performance at the Catscratch Club. Wow!<br /><br />Reviewers- Please stop trying to compare film and show experiences. Rentheads go to the theatre. Film enthusiasts purchase this DVD musical. Comparison is futile. Or you will be assimilated in a wash!

0316172324|4.0|According to Gladwell, we think without thinking by  using limited information to come to our conclusion. This is an approach we use in the time of information overload, probably do reduce the intelectual stress of the overload.      Rapid cognition is a different name for hunch or intuition and several of the examples Gladwell discusses are interesting:  the discovery of a Greek statue that fooled one group of art experts, but was later shown to be a fake by another group. Based on this example, the book analyzes alternative uses of thinslicing and gives a wide range of example from speed dating, tennis, war games, malpractice suits, popular music, and predicting divorce.  The stories are interesting and Gladwell expertly weaves these examples with accounts of scientific studies.  He points out an important fact: science partially, but seldom full, explains the largely unconscious phenomenon that we have all experienced at one time or another in our lives.     I agree with many reviewers that thinslicing reflects our experiences, training, knowledge and prejudices.    This book is probably one of the more thoughtprovoking books that I have read.  He writes well and the text is engaging.  Recommended.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye West is no doubt a genius to me but College Dropout goes wrong with one thing. The production is amazing and it shows that he is a great producer. His lyrics are nice and even though he can go to the trash that everybody else raps about he actually talks about something different every once in a while. The problem would be the fact that there are way too many skits. The skits are weak and you start to lose track of the songs. Nice debut but I'm glad he learned his lesson with the boring and unneeded skits and didn't use them in Late Registration because they kill the originality of his album.
B00005JLEJ|4.0|Kagemusha is another excellent film by Kurasawa, though a notch below \\"7 Samurai\\" and \\"Throne of Blood.\\"  All the characters feel \\"real\\" - everyone is there for a purpose.  My only critique is the disjointed nature of the psychedelic scenes, though others may disagree.  This film belongs in any serious collector's library.

This has all the best from early Sherrie hit to the later Swear to God.  All of it great quality.  If you like 60's music and the newer music by Frankie Valli this has all the original recordings.  I am completely satisfied with this purchase.

0312995423|5.0|I was not able to put this down until I was finished.  It grabs your attention and peaks your curiosity from the first few pages.  There are so many twists and turns that you have to keep reading to the end.  Brown's books keep you interested the entire way through and this was no exception.  Would recommend to any type of reader.
B00005JOFO|5.0|The various reactions I've heard and read about Brokeback Mountain seem to say more about the reactor than it does the film.  A very simple film about two very specific characters in a very specific time and place has been exaggerated into all sorts of politicized nonsense for and against.  So many agendas, so little time. <br /> <br />I found this a beautifully written, acted, directed and photographed film filled with subtlety and understanding.  A compassionate study of an illicit love in a time and place of great repression, the movie walked a knife-edge and would have been even greater fodder for the late-night comedians had it not been in the hands of superb film-makers. Their skill has allowed a general audience to appreciate a film containing, for many, uncomfortable subject matter. <br /> <br />I applaud the great courage of the two young leads who have been justly praised for their performances.  It looks good now, but it had a tremendous possibility for not only failure but also humiliation, and I recognize their risk-taking. <br /> <br />But there was the writing of McMurtry and Osana, and the direction of Ang Lee and they made it work. And the specificity of the time and place is everything. <br /> <br />This is a story of these two men, and the ruin they bring to themselves and others trying to live their lives as a lie, which was about their only option there and then.  I don't believe these guys lives bear any relation to the lives of gays in the great urban settings of New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles etc.  Jack might have fit in there, Ennis...never.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed the film as a specific story, like any other story.  The great craft involved allowed me to accept these characters and to eventually care about them, but I found no need to extrapolate beyond that to any great generalities.  If there was a message to this film, to me it was simply: live and let live.  And my God, wouldn't that be something. <br />
B000AARKOO|1.0|There were worse movies to come out last year, but Kingdom of Heaven was surely the most disappointing.  Kingdom takes modern 20th century stereotypes and forces them into a medieval costume drama, and the result are quite horrific.  According to Ridley Scott, Jerusalem was the equivalent of a hippie commune where Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived in peace until some evil conniving Christians screwed it all up.  This revisionist history is ignores the complexities of the region in favor of simplistic Hollywood cliches.   <br /> <br />And is it too much to ask in a crusade movie to actually show a real Crusader?  Balian doesn't even believe in the cause, but rather shows a modern liberal's disdain for Christianity, and makes grandiose speeches for tolerance instead.  This character has motivations much more similar to our 20th century simpathies than any medieval mindset.  Hell, make his character devoted to the cause but misguided.  Anything but this.  When characterization goes this awry, it just feels like everyone is playing dress up.  Ultimately, this film shows more about the preconceptions of modern Hollywood than any insights into the motivations of the actual crusaders.

As a follow up to \\"Room On fire\\", i consider it fa better, possibly as good as \\"Is This It\\"  Valensi's and Hammond's guitar work in \\"Heart In A Cage\\" is a highlight, and i cant get enough of \\"On The Otherside\\"
034544678X|4.0|This is a great book if you want to know ALL about animal behavior and animal psychology. It is easy to read and interesting and I keep it with my dog's bag so it's always around. However, it does contain so much information that at times you can get sidetracked from the task at hand - learning how to lead your dog. Her shorter book - How to be the Leader of the Pack...and Have Your Dog Love You for it! - is much more concise, less expensive and contains all the salient points to get you started. I would start with the short version and move to The Other End of the Leash if and when you want more in depth understanding, or if you have a particularly challenging dog.  <br />Overall Patricia B.McConnell teaches people how to live with and lead their dogs with compasionate and balance. <br />

B000E6UK5K|5.0|There are two camps of Pink Floyd fans, and you really had no choice about which one you belonged to: you either discovered them with, or after, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", or you somehow caught on to them before that career-turner. I first heard them, oddly enough, with the excellent \\"Obscured by clouds\\", and then went back to everything previous, all before \\"Dark Side\\" was ever released. If you were an early Floyd fan like that, I think you came to expect one thing with them: the unexpected. Some material worked (Astronomy Domine, One of these days, Careful with that Axe, Cymbaline, etc. etc. etc.), and some songs didn't work (Seamus, Corporal Clegg and several parts of Atom Heart Mother), but you got what you got, and we all hung patiently, waiting for every subsequent album. Post Dark-Siders, on the other hand, expect a masterpiece from beginning to end with every album. So it is with David's new album. Not perfect, but very much him, and very rewarding from beginning to end for those willing to sit and listen to it with an open mind. Too mellow? Do we not remember the earliest of Floyd days, with acoustic-based songs like A Pillow of Winds, Green is the Colour or Remember a Day, the likes of which show up on this album in the form of The Blue or Then I Close My Eyes? I, for one, am A.) thrilled that Dave came out of retirement, and B.) very pleased that there is nothing resembing \\"Division Bell\\" AOR junk like Lost For Words or Take It Back. On top of all that, the guitar playing is, as always, masterful and eloquent, emotional and liquid. So, forget your expectations - David Gilmour and Pink Floyd have NEVER been about expectations.

0679405372|5.0|If you are going to read only one of Virginia Woolf's many works, this is the one to read.  She is the greatest novelist, but her novels cannot be equal, some being better or more universal than others.  She really *arrives* in this one.  I first read it twenty years ago in college, but I still think of phrases, thoughts, and concepts from this book.  The novel's themes resonate the way poetry does.  Worth the reputation.  I hope no one ever tries to make a movie out of this one.
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I really love the strokes, but their whole image and sound changed with their new producer.  Julian Casablancas lost his nearly trademark microphone static.  The songs are so much different than the groups first two albums.  I anticipated this album so greatly, but found it to be a fluke. I even bought tickets to their concert, but the group seems to have lost their original sound, and this album is just mediocre.  I prefer their older cd's much more than this one.

0060512806|5.0|\\"Cryptonomicon,\\" like much of Neal Stephenson's work, defies easy description.  His ideas are so involved and interwoven with the text, it can be difficult to unravel the story as a whole.  \\"Cryptonomicon\\" deals with the ideas of codebreaking, information security, Holocaust morality, global economics, the evolution of mythology, and the inherent insanity of war.  He includes complex descriptions of encryption schemes and expositions of many complicated ideas, yet somehow manages to maintain a slick narrative. <br /> <br />I really cannot praise Stephenson's literary genius enough.  Having read five of his books now (\\"Cryptonomicon,\\" the Baroque Cycle, and \\"Snow Crash\\") I feel that \\"Cryptonomicon\\" is second only to \\"Snow Crash,\\" and vastly superior to many books I have read.  He manages his multiple-perspective narrative skillfully and creates fascinating characters in a wholly believable world.
B000AP2ZDK|4.0|J Dilla a.k.a. Jay Dee passed away Friday, February 10, 2006 from complications from lupus.  I started the review off this way because a lot of people don't know a lot about Jay Dee.  Unless you were heavily in tune with the hip-hop scene, you may not have noticed his presence.  As an early member of Slum Village, Jay Dee was instrumental in bringing older R&B and Jazz sound back to the forefront of hip-hop music.  It has always been present in rap music, dating back to \\"Rapper's Delight\\" by the Sugarhill Gang.  It's been continured over the years by deejays like Pete Rock, Jazzy Jeff, Dj Premier, and most notably Kanye West.  Jay Dee continued this tradition in all the music he has produced for the likes of A Tribe Called Quest, Slum Village, Pharcyde, and Common.  Donuts is his last release before his untimely death and serves up some of the best instrumental music to rock your head to.<br /><br />It's virtually impossible for this to be like other reviews where you break down each track.  Each track possesses it's own unique flavor.  And even though there are some that will leave you perplexed, it still shows you the extensive amount of time it must take to find those tracks that make the cut.  Jay Dee obviously did a lot of digging in the crates for some of these cuts.  Still other selections are a blending of sounds and samples, almost putting you in the mind of techno or drum-n-bass music.<br /><br />Those that appreciate the time and energy it takes to be a deejay and producer will be enlightened from the collection on Donuts.  If anything, Donuts will serve as the starting point and inspiration for the growing number of deejays and wannabe producers in the game today.  Jay Dee's respect in the game didn't come over night, but he never let go of niche once he found his place in the industry.  He will be truly missed by those who know of him personally, those who knew of his work, and those who will come to know his music over the years to come.  Be on the lookout for a future Jay Dee album from BBE this summer.  R.I.P. Jay Dee.he lookout for a future Jay Dee album from BBE this summer.  R.I.P. Jay Dee.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|I actually ordered this for a friend of mine who listened to her Eagles CD for a whole month. I thought she would enjoy watching them actually play, and listen to them play in a concert, so I ordered this hoping it would be good. Well, it was. She loved it (still loves it) and enjoyed all the extra features it had. Because of all her positive comments, my dad now wants one, so I'm considering buying one for him.
0394873742|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew for his 1st birthday.  He loves books, and of course the board books are best for his destructive nature.  From the minute I gave him this book, he has been thrilled with it.  One of his favorite games is to point at something and say \\"what's that?\\".  Well there are tons of \\"whats thats\\" in this book, so it keeps him entertained for a long time.  He also thinks it's fun to climb over, lay on, sit on, stand on...you name it, the book is used for it!
0609610570|4.0|This book is very different from the standard, bland, politically-correct leadership books out there. It gives a hard-hitting no nonsense message of leading through getting things done. It picks up and builds on Jack Welche's \\"candor\\" theme.<br /><br />Unlike most books on leadership which stress deligation, empowerment of subordinates, and generally \\"being nice to people.\\" This book stresses that leaders need to be tough, ask hard questions, and have a more rollup-your-sleeves-and-get-involved-in-the-details attitude. The book's description of an ideal leader seems authoritarian at times; however, I like their message that a leadership shouldn't just preside over but lead hir organizations through being in the front line.<br /><br />Overall, I think its a fresh, much needed perspective. It's helped me see a few flaws in my own leadership.<br /><br />I think the authors are right on target.

0151008116|5.0|I read this book once in Grade 9 on my own and again in Grade 12 when my English class studied it. The first and second stories, as this book contains two different tales about the same thing, were a cause of much thought and disscussion both times. Neither one seemed fully real but at the same time, it was so real I was there. Just another paradox in a book overflowing with them. I have still not made my choice about which story to put my faith in, something I'm certain would annoy Pi. That is what this book is really about, choices. Do you choose the first or second story? Which one you choose and how long it takes you to decide speaks volumes about you and there is no room for fence sitters.
1419359827|4.0|I purchased the audio version of this book and found it to be an interesting drive book in the car.  Ferrazzi's personal experiences laced throughout the book give good examples to the techniques he promotes.  I did find the audio narrator to be slightly arrogant in describing some situations, but once I got past that section of a particular setup, I found the premise of his theories to be well founded and worthwhile.  Ferrazzi reminds us that relationships are everything in the business world which also lends itself well to the political world, too.

B000E6UK5K|2.0|On An Island is basically a continuation of the mediocrity that was A Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell. Both were de facto Gilmour solo albums and both had 1 or 2 good songs on each with just a bunch of filler for the rest. On An Island is basically the same. The title track is decent, as is the Island Jam that isn't actually part of the album but the vast majority of the rest of the stuff is boring filler. And just because a song is slow doesn't mean it's boring. Compare \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" and you'll see the difference. Basically if this wasn't David Gilmour, nobody would care and this would be quickly forgotten. The man can play music well but has trouble coming up with good music on his own that isn't written by other people, like Waters for most of the Floyd stuff, his co-collaborators on Momentary Lapse of Reason or his wife on Division Bell and this album.

B00005JKEZ|4.0|I used this movie to make the Middle Ages accesible for my sixth grade students. It's hard to find movies you can show at school that are entertaining enough to hold the kids' interest, but this movie fills the bill. <br />   -Joe Bordonaro
B000C65Z1G|5.0|While I am not a big fan of LeCarre's novels, this movie is intelligent and moving as it relates the love story between a socially concious Tessa and her husband.  At first he feels Tessa has betrayed him but eventually discovers the truth behind her excursions into the African countryside.  More a love story than a political thriller (although it has that side <br />too).  Great acting and Racel Weisz's performance is Oscar worthy and you will see why she won.
B0001I562I|5.0|I first watched this movie as a kid in the 80's, and practically wore the old vhs copy out back then. It was great to find it on dvd and relive the memories all over again. This movie has a little bit of something for everyone. Also of note is the pioneering CG special effects used in this film.. (the environment mapping on the spaceship). Groundbreaking for the time...
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|By age 30, one's taste in music is supposed to be settled so imagine my surprise, back in 2001, upon discovering the unbelievable talent that is The Strokes. I was astounded by \\"Is this it,\\" and devoured it for two years straight. \\"Room on Fire\\" I thoroughly enjoyed, and was not surprised that it did not match the genius of their first offering. In, \\"First Impressions of Earth,\\" they come closer to their initial standard, and provide fans with an incredibly complex CD of which one cannot tire. On this release, I like \\"Electricityscape\\" and \\"Killing Lies\\" the best, but honestly, I value all of these songs.<br /><br />Just in case you are not familiar with this band or are an old fogy like me often stuck in the 70s and 80s, I encourage you to give these guys a try. If crisp, inspired tunes mean anything to you, then you'll be glad that to open your ears to them. Overall, there are numerous reasons to embrace the music of The Strokes, but, perhaps the simplest, and most powerful, is that their work makes us happy. What better result could we ask for than riffs and chords filling us with life. As to their appearance or age or lifestyle, or any of those other conformist concerns, I could care less. If I had my way there would be fifty more artists just like them. Bravo!
B000059Z8J|5.0|Despite what we'd now see as mediocre special effects, the sheer power of this film is undeniable.  The first time Christopher Reeve appears as Superman, one can't help but flush with nostalgia for this ideal of superhero lore.  From a time when truth, justice, and \\"the American way\\" seemed much clearer and cleaner.  A true classic for all generations.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Best song: a tie actually. 'Take a Breath' and 'Pocketful of Stones'. <br /> <br />Some decent lyrics, some awesome ones. Typical gilmour. <br /> <br />Awesome orchestration and wonderful guest work. <br /> <br />Soaring solos that are edgy,smooth,piercing, and soulful in places. <br /> <br />Also, great sax work by Gilmour on 'Red Sky at Night'. Very suprising that he is that good, he just started playing. Very nice indeed. <br /> <br />thanks David!

0307276902|2.0|Being yet-another-person who got into the hype that Oprah made around this book, I decided to purchase it, only after a few months when I felt that my excitement for the book would die a bit so that I would have an objective look on the book. I was extremely disappointed. It was in no way a page-turner like it was all hyped up to be, nor it was in any way a well-written even.  <br /> <br />I get the concept of the book, the fact that the writer was \\"supposedly\\" in rehab for treatment against extreme drug addictions, and for that I was not expecting anything, no eloquence nor coherence even, but still, I was disappointed.  <br /> <br />Now, with James Frey being exposed as fraud, I have one recommendation for him, \\"If you plan on being a good writer, go read a few books first\\"
B0002BK9IU|4.0|Certainly this is not one of the classic Ramones albums, but it has alot going for it just the same;  <br /> <br />Bill Laswell produced it and layered the guitars giving it a dense roar.  <br /> <br />If like me you are a fan of Marky's drumming you've never heard him hammer it home more so than on this one.  <br /> <br />It features later day classic \\"Pet Semetary\\".  <br /> <br />It was the last album with Dee Dee playing bass (he did continue to write for them after leaving the band). <br /> <br />Besides, in my humble opinion, there are no bad Ramones albums.

B0009QTS1M|4.0|Russell Crowe really is great in this film, he exudes charisma and you totally buy that this guy would be be a threat to anyone wanting to be Caesar, since the Caesar's didn't have to be blood relations.  Pheonix is also really good, he plays his sadistic character with gusto, and if you know anything about the history of the Caesars you know they were usually stark raving mad....as for Harris, he was just an acting icon, and he steals every scene he is in.  The film itself is beautiful, whatever you think of Ridley Scott as a director, he does know how to shoot a visually spectacular film, the openning battle scene is fabulous.  This is an action packed winner, I really don't know anyone who did not like this film in some way and most loved it.

0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins' book has done more for our hospital than we thought possible.  We spent a year working through the concepts in \\"Good to Great\\" with our management team and it transformed the way we think about leadership.

I would highly recommend it to any healthcare manager who is interested in transforming their organization to one that is focused on getting the most out of their people and organization.

B00000G3I2|3.0|I saw The Big Chill for the first time only this year. It was playing on TNT or some such station and I was intrigued. I've since purchased the DVD and have enjoyed the film several times now. In my view, it deserves to be considered a minor cult classic. <br /> <br />What I found was a collection of very good efforts by actors who were, at the time, not well known and fairly inexperienced. I'm quite impressed by Mr Kasdan's eye for casting. This is a superb ensemble! We find in this story a re-grouping of a previously tightly-bonded klatch with the usual variety of contrasting personalities and yet a melding of similar interests. <br />  <br />Alex dies and thus the reason for the gathering. At the funeral (Chapter 2), Alex does not seem to have very many friends. Outside of a handful of family members, Alex' few former classmates and his youngish girlfriend, the church is empty. Even the minister didn't really know him. <br /> <br />These friends end up staying with Sarah (Glenn Close) and her husband Harold (Kevin Kline) over the longish weekend. They spout off glib one-liners and exchange a somewhat forced repartee in multiple attempts to lighten their grief. How many of us have done the same thing in our own moments of despair? <br /> <br />I was impressed by the frequent and liberal use of the word `love.' Several times by word and by gesture, these people affirm their deep commitment to each other. Several exchanges (some heated, some more Socratic) ensue that reflect both unresolved issues from a previous life and the current grieving process. The obvious attachments and subsequent fulfillment of sexual tensions seems to include a nod toward our collective Survival Instinct. It's at once ironic and terribly humorous that the person most openly interested in The Act (Jeff Goldblum as Michael) is left to play with the propeller on his junior aviator's bed.  <br />Moral considerations aside, I somehow did find satisfaction in Sarah's making arrangements (Chapters 25-27) for Harold to attempt to father Meg's (Mary Kay Place) child. Perhaps this was self-induced pay-back for former sins to a degree, but I also found it to be a selfless act on the behalf of a good friend - well, maybe two good friends. Harold didn't seem to mind.   <br /> <br />I suppose the popular front-runners in this movie could be Glenn Close and William Hurt. For my money, I'll take Mary Kay Place. She's solid and she wears comfortably into middle age (episodes of Law and Order, The West Wing and Numb3rs most recently). <br /> <br />In writing book and film reviews for Amazon, I tend to do a little research. Including in that is a reading of at least a portion of the reviews previously posted. The Big Chill seems to have pulled in an inordinate number of reviews not only negative but often angry, and for a curious set of reasons: \\"the sets are cheap, the acting is dated and the conversation shallow.\\" I don't agree. <br /> <br />This is a \\"Conversational Film,\\" a true \\"Talkie,\\" a film where the substance of history and idea and thought is delivered much more so by verbal interactions among the characters than by elaborate sets or expensive action sequences. It's a Time Capsule depicting a narrow segment of Collegiate Society. It could have just as easily been a group of Pre-Nursing Students, or a Bible Study/Buddhist Meditation/Holocaust Studies Group or just some Kids interested in Agri-Business. Mr Kasdan chose some young Radical Anarchist Wantabes who decided that some attempt at conformation was necessary in order to get along in The Cold World. Not all are pleased about it. One or two tried to be more faithful to the Ideal than the others but it was a costly choice: one becoming an almost constant user of recreational pharmaceuticals and the other becoming dead. <br /> <br />Neither am I bothered so much by the `missing flashback.' Mr Kasdan made an editorial decision with which I happen to agree. I find amusement in knowing that the exposed body parts (sans the face), whilst being prepared and included in the final version, belongs to Kevin Costner. It fits in with the black humor of it all, almost on the same level as someone auditioning for the part of Yorick in Hamlet. <br /> <br />There is wonderful nostalgia in this film! Why should we expect such a work, 23 years old, to align with current thinking? Why should we expect it to reflect the impatient and shallow Gen-X World or some middle-aged shriveled prune-head (me included) who can't or simply won't make allowances for others. We should relax a little and view it and enjoy it within the context of its own Time. <br /> <br />I for one would be delighted to see some of my college friends again; it's been 30-plus years. And if I should do so well as these guys, who so obviously love and care for each other, I'd consider it time and money and effort well spent. <br /> <br />But most of us would have had to have been there, I suppose. <br /> <br />Russell de Ville <br />8 March 2006 <br /> <br />
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Really awesome show, great actors and actresses, totally cool special effects and features!! <br />A must see for all science fiction fans!!!
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is one of the best books I have ever read. Short, written in a simple style, and devoid of all emotion for the first half of the book, nevertheless it's one of the clearest explanations of existentialism I've read and has had a large impact on the way I think about life.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I ACTUALLY PURCHASED THIS CD FOR A FRIEND BUT HE IS REALLY ENJOYING IT AND IS VERY HAPPY WITH IT.

0446577383|4.0|\\"Camel Club\\" is an interesting thriller that moves along quite well. There is a host of characters so you may be flipping back to make sure of who's doing what. Years back the plot might have seemed a little far fetched but in today's world almost anything is possible. The main character seems a little more human than usual. He is not the toughest and does make mistakes and gets hurt. I recommend this book to anyone who likes conspiracy thrillers.
1591391105|4.0|I thought the book was well structured and does apply to several levels although probably more taylored toward the senior executive positions.  What it does best is to force you to stop and plan your approach to being successful.  It talks about early wins and about watching out for serious landminds that could jeopardize your future in your new job.  Highly recommend. <br />
0689877692|5.0|One Red Dot was given as a gift to friends in California.  They were delighted to receive such a wonderful book.  They felt it was truly unique in the genre of pop-up books.  It's a book to be treasured.
B0000214F0|3.0|Abandoned by its own director, and notorious for its graphic violence and sex scenes,'Caligula', occupies a major place in film history - but rarely does it seem to get judged fairly.. As an historical account of Gaius Caligula it is perhaps fitting - such an outragous figure deserves this sort of treatment. There is so much that goes to waste in the movie though - great actors, elaborate set designs, not a bad script..the reason it goes to waste is the weakness of focus in the movie - it seems that the camera is always in the wrong place, the greatest monologues of the film are routinely overshadowed by the other things that are going on in the frame. The colors and image are just not the right sharpness for such a grand epic. The entire film has a disjointed feel..like they can't decide what direction to take.. maybe the director abandoned the project too soon to save this film that had so much potential.
0060899190|5.0|This book is amazing.  The secrets revealed are so deep and real that it's hard not to read this book in one night. <br /> <br />I loved it. efffffing amazing.  <br /> <br /> <br />that was a really bad review but whatever...point is...the book will change your life.
B00001OH7X|5.0|Not usually considered to be Bowie's best, 'Lodger' is a jewel waiting to be rediscovered and reconsidered - as one of Bowie's most daring and underrated ventures. I might be out of my mind - but I just love the eno/Bowie collaborations - even when they sound dated (musically speaking) there is an undeniable charm. It is also one of Bowie's most contagious albums - I find I can't get some of the songs out of my head for hours after I have listened to the album!
B0002OERI0|5.0|A great album, especially if you're a runner, you can go on for miles!  My only complaint...there should be an edited version for the \\"kiddies.\\"  My kids like a lot of the songs but some of them I've had to find online \\"radio cuts\\" - it's puzzling why there was only an Explicit release.
630542845X|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and my husband and I absolutely loved it.  It was one of those movies where you felt like your life had been changed when you walk out of the movie theater.  I've thought about it a couple times over the years, but figured I would probably never see it again.  Well it happened to be on a movie channel tonight and I watched it again.  It still had the same effect on me and my kids were really interested in it.  Unfortunatley, I turned it on 35 minutes after it had started and the kids still had homework to do and showers to take.  So I decided to check here to see if they sell it.  They do and I bought it immediately!  It is one movie I will LOVE to share with my kids.  It is such a powerful movie with a powerful message that is still relevent today.  I think it has a great message about how we treat people that are different.  My kids are in high school and I think that this is something that will change the way they view people that may not have the same things (i.e. looks, advantages, etc. ) that they do.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is shiny.  Honestly I must say that fans of Firefly probobly enjoy it more than people who never watched the show, but it's still a good sci-fi movie in the grand scale of things.  When you compare it to some of the absolutely pointless \\"visually stunnning\\" JUNK that has been in theaters pretending to be sci-fi, it's practically Shakespeare. Shakespeare with a little Mark Twain, some gunslinger westerns, some Buffy The Vampire Slayer mixed in. Not to mention Terrifying Space Monkeys.
B000065V3H|5.0|Awesome! Bought for my husband for Valentine's Day!  Even our 8 year old son loved it.  Excellent condition.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|TV Music as High Tragedy, but very human in scope. VERY different SF score, for a VERY different SF series. (Equally as good as the \\"pilot\\" movie score.)
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Watched the whole season in a week and a half. Cant get enough and might suffer severe withdrawl until season 6 is released.
0451197879|5.0|This novel is slow, but it kind of reminded me of Catcher In The Rye, and I think that's because of the depressed mood the character happens to be in throughout the entire novel. It's actually quite interesting how Stephen King was able to come up with this novel.  <br />The novel is about a man who loses his job, his wife, and ends up losing his sanity, because his entire world has crumbled around him. <br />Yes, it's a bit depressing, but it still happens to be an entertaining read.
B00000JNO1|5.0|Skynyrd did something very early on in their career that very few bands do. They released an AMAZING first album, and then followed it with a just as equally AMAZING second album (Pronounced, and Second Helping respectively.) With these two records the southern Skynyrd boys could have called it quits and still went down as legends, but fortunately MCA demanded more records.<br />Skynyrds third album NUTHIN FANCY, is not the absolute triumph that the first two albums were (perhaps the band recognized this when giving it the title?) but it ain't no waste of resource either.<br />It was 1975, and rock music was generally getting to be louder and louder all around. Hard rock bands were taking ques from the metal pioneers and cranking up the sound. This can easily be noticed on the opening track SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL and the albums first single ON THE HUNT. These songs lose a little of the heart felt personalities of the first records but are both completely pisser, and kept the band well seated at the front of the seventies Hard Rock board.<br />The rest of the album takes on a more down home southern style, than even the first two. Closer to an Allman Brothers feel than a Skynyrd feel, but again, this is not a bad thing. The bluesy ballad CHEATIN WOMAN is memorable, as is the moving, tonky, WHISKEY- ROCK-A-ROLLER. Other goods on this plate as well.<br />Some may say that this is nothing but an album of filler SKYNYRD stuff, but I can't agree with that. This is great stuff, just not as legendary as what preceeded it. Its classic rock music, from a classic rock band, its just that it prides itself in bein' NUTHIN FANCY.<br />I gave this one four and three fourth stars... but we can just say I gave it five.
0634049011|5.0|This book is great.   Especially considering its less then ten dollars.   I would buy this book for four or five times that price.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Once upon a time, I found the Firefly DVD set, and, armed with a gift card, a great deal of curiosity, and faith in Whedon's brilliance, I snatched it up.  I popped the first DVD into my computer, and hoping that I hadn't wasted my money, I watched the pilot episode.   <br /> <br />I didn't sleep at all that night, and I'd finished all fourteen episodes by the end of the next day.  I sat stunned after Objects in Space, wondering what kind of idiot would cancel a show so wonderful.  I honestly love it more than both Buffy and Angel combined, something I'd never have thought possible.  Firefly has even usurped Stargate's position as my favorite Sci-Fi show. <br /> <br />The visual effects are stunning.  The camera work isn't slick like on most other Sci-Fi shows, but gritty and realistic.  You feel almost like you're actually there.   <br /> <br />The mixing of cultures - particularly American and Chinese - is disconcerting at first, but only adds to the richness of the Firefly universe.  The fact that there are no aliens makes this show very very different from most Sci-Fi - and Firefly doesn't need aliens to make the universe interesting. <br /> <br />The show is called Firefly because the ship the crew lives on, Serenity, is Firefly class.  They travel from world to world, taking on illegal and, when they have no alternative, legitimate jobs.  The Captain, Mal Reynolds, dwells firmly in the gray areas of life, a disappointed, sarcastic leader who'll stab an unarmed opponent but return stolen medical supplies to a sick community.  He doesn't let a gunshot wound slow him down, but he's also sure to whine about the pain.  He fought as a browncoat, a rebel, in a war against the corrupt government, and lost; the show takes place six years later. <br /> <br />His second in command is Zoe, a stoic, intelligent woman who fought with Mal against the Alliance.  She has a dry wit and tends to be rather more sensible than Mal, though she is completely loyal.  She's married tothe pilot, Wash, who is unbelievably funny, if not exactly an experienced fighter.  It's clear from the outset that Zoe and Wash care deeply for each other, even if they do have some vicious marital spats (Wash's jealousy of Zoe and Mal's relationship and history; Zoe's wish to have a child while Wash prevaricates). <br /> <br />Inara is a registered Companion - basically, a high-class courtesan who gets to choose her own jobs.  Mal takes issue with her choice of career, and there are some definite UST vibes between the two of them.  Inara's the respectable member of the ship, oddly enough, and due to her status can get the crew places that would otherwise have been off limits to them.  The other respectable member of the crew - though he starts out just as a passenger - is Shepherd Book, the futuristic equivalent of a preacher.  He believes very strongly in God, but also has a great deal of knowledge in matters not exactly pertaining to religion, as well as a mysterious connection to the Alliance. <br /> <br />Jayne is the burly, surly mercenary, with changeable loyalties and, frankly, a brain the size of a walnut.  He's crude, shortsighted, and an all-around scumbag - and so hysterically (and often unintentionally)funny that you'll forgive him his faults easily. <br /> <br />Kaylee is the engineer, a young woman with a permanently bright outlook and smile.  She has an expert touch with machinery and a close bond with the ship.  Kaylee is youthful and inexperienced when it comes to theft and firefights, and she freezes during battle and nearly gets herself killed.  Although very pretty and a great flirt, the one guy she's really interested in - Simon Tam - is inept and reserved enough that the relationship never quite manages to get off the ground. <br /> <br />Simon and his teenaged sister River are fugitives from the Alliance.  Simon gave up his life as a successful doctor and rescued River from an Alliance academy, where she was being torured and experimented on.  As a result, she's very unbalanced, though highly intelligent - and she has a way of knowing things she shouldn't be able to know. <br /> <br />The crew isn't exactly one big happy family - Jayne, for instance, is universally distrusted, and River creeps everyone out - but the interplay between the characters is endlessly fascinating and amusing - and sometimes heartbreaking. <br /> <br />Villains range from small-time petty crooks to the government itself - at times, even members of the Serenity crew serve as the villain.  The scariest bad guys are the Reavers, who we never actually see, and the Hands of Blue guys, who are hunting down River. <br /> <br />The plots are intricate and draw the viewer in, and the dialogue is either hysterical or touching or both.  Firefly has both wit and heart, and it's very easy to fall in love with the characters and the stories themselves. <br /> <br />I suppose I should mention the Western feel of the show, as well, though I honestly don't see why so many people make such a big deal out of it.  The incorrect grammar and country twang can be off-putting at first, but I got used to it quickly and didn't really notice it after a while.  As for the planets full of Western-like characters...well, it makes sense to me.  Some planets are rich, and those have all the Sci-Fi tech you could want.  Some are poor, and the people there have to rely on livestock and farming to support themselves.  It's just another way of showing how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, only this time it's spread out over a number of planets, instead of just the one.
037571457X|5.0|This is a terrific book, and as all the other reviews heap praise on it as well, I'll just leave it at that--except to point out that this is one of those \\"comic books\\" that can be enjoyed even by people who would normally never read a comic book. I've lent it out to several friends now, all of them university English profs like myself. As a reader of a fair number of comics (mostly alternative, non-superhero titles like this one), it's nice to be able to share the joys of this unique medium with people who would normally think it beneath them.
B000E1155E|5.0|Holding the United Kingdom's record for the largest first week sales of a debut album and the distinction of \\"Best New Band\\" and \\"Best British Band\\" in the 2006 NME Awards, the Arctic Monkeys's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not seems to be a safe bet for one of 2006's best. Yet, is it worth all of the hype? With its high energy, extrospective lyrics and attitude, it is a remarkable debut, but quite short of life changing.<br /><br />The album opens with the hollow riff-heavy song, \\"View From The Afternoon,\\" that, despite its shallowness, forshadows the raw fun to ensue. The album continues with their number one single, \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor.\\" The track's influences range from The Streets to the The Libertines and mantains the energetic precedent of their predecessors. The Monkeys' social commentary continues with the excellent \\"Fake Tales of San Francisco.\\"<br /><br />One qualm of this album is the length. With thirteen tracks stuffed into forty-one minutes, the energy of this band is blink and miss it with some songs, such as \\"Dancing Shoes\\" and \\"You Probably Couldn't See...\\"<br /><br />By the time you get to \\"Still Take You Home,\\" you realize that the Arctic Monkeys have little technique with a spontaneous sound, reminiscent of The Hives, that is quite effective.<br /><br />Where the Arctic Monkeys best their jaded contemporaries, such as the similar The Walkmen is their evocative social commentary on their peers, such as \\"Riot Van,\\" one the album's best songs with its mellow undertone and the lyrical story it paints.<br /><br />Then the backlash comes. You hear \\"Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured.\\" You hear \\"Mardy Bum.\\" You hear \\"Perhaps Vampires Is a Bit Strung But...\\" And you realize its the same old show again. These songs, however, prove that it is a show worth hearing.<br /><br />\\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" is a bit of a bore, but the album picks up with the final two tracks \\"From The Ritz To The Rubble\\" and \\"A Certain Romance.\\"<br /><br />While the album is far from as revolutionary and life-changing as The Strokes debut album, Is This It?, the Arctic Monkeys deserve much of the praise it recieves. Their energy. Their lyrics. And their overall talent sets this promising band apart from their peers.<br /><br />Grade : A- (92)<br /><br />Download : Arctic Monkeys - Riot Van, Arctic Monkeys - I Bet You Look Good On The Dance Floor, Arctic Monkeys - Fake Tales of San Francisco, Arctic Monkeys - From the Ritz to the Rubble<br /><br />Skip It : Arctic Monkeys - View From The Afternoonand \\"A Certain Romance.\\" <br /> <br />While the album is far from as revolutionary and life-changing as The Strokes debut album, Is This It?, the Arctic Monkeys deserve much of the praise it recieves.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|To all the reviews claiming that this is not Floyd enough. Please tell exactly which two Floyd albums were the same? Animals is not the same as Atom Heart Mother, nethier The Final Cut from Piper At The Gates? To me that is exactly why I have always enjoyed each Floyd release or solo project from these guys. Because I knew when I bought a new cd it wasn't going to be Dark Side Of The Moon each time. One, if not the only band that I know that would release the what they had knowing that it was not radio friendly, not what they thought was expected from them. Will this see much top 40 play? I doubt it but then again did Animals or Atom Heart Mother? The true Floyd fans know what to expect and that is not to expect the same thing again and again. This is a fine cd which I for one am very impressed. Thank you Dave, ---zen--->.
B000BYA5GO|3.0|Just a warning to those purchasing this DVD. Inexplicably, Lions Gate has reformatted this film from its original 2.40:1 aspect ratio to a 1.78:1 ratio. This means the film has been pseudo pan-and-scanned to entirely fill a widescreen TV, just as a full screen version fills a standard TV.  However, new shipments of the DVD are being sent out with a sticker over the original packaging listing the aspect ratio as 2.40:1; presumably, Lions Gate has realized their mistake and shipped out corrected discs.  When purchasing this product from Amazon, I would recommend either waiting a few weeks to ensure Amazon has the corrected discs, or I would check the back of the DVD case before removing the shrink wrap once the DVD has arrived. If the sticker is on the lower-left corner of the back of the DVD stating \\"Aspect Ratio 2.40:1,\\" then it is one of the corrected discs. If, however, there is no sticker and the packaging states \\"Aspect Ratio 1.78:1,\\" then I would ship the DVD back to Amazon and request a replacement with the corrected aspect ratio.  No word yet as to whether or not Lions Gate will be offering a disc replacement program for those who purchased the 1.78:1 version, but hopefully they will offer one soon. In the meantime, make sure you check the package to make sure what you are buying is, in fact, the correct version of the film, as it was intended to be seen.
B00000K0DT|5.0|Nothing is quite  as it   appears in this remarkable gem from director Bryan Singer. One of those rare movies that you can watch 20 times and  notice some critical  detail  during the 20th viewing that you missed  in each of the first 19.   The acting is as good as it gets. Dealing with criminals on a regular basis as I do (as a lawyer, not as one of them), I can assure you that the characters in this movie speak  just like the real thing.  Those viewers who claim that the ending made them feel as if they  had been cheated have no serendipity.  What the ending actually does is provide endless hours of additional enjoyment as you retrace the movie's steps and ultimately realize that, yes, it all made perfect sense;  you just had no idea until you went back and put it all together.  As pointed out by other reviewers, this film contains a wealth of memorable lines.  One of my favorites is when the cops tell  Todd Hockney that they have placed him in Queens on the date of a recent hijacking  committed there.  Hockney's response:  \\"Really?  I live in Queens... What? Did you have a team of monkeys working around the clock to figure that out?\\"  WARNING: For those who haven't seen this film, do NOT read the review entitled \\"Quite the Shocker,\\" or you will miss out on all the fun.
B000B0WO0I|4.0|I AM A SIMPLY RED watcher since 1985 when I was 18 years old. I'm 39 now and has not neglected getting the artists' releases including the five DVDs. But I'm no blind follower. I could not savour the STARS album thats why its the gap thats missing in my CD line-up. Stars has an accompanying making-of DVD but I passed owning it off. For me, the best Simply Red songs are their original compositions, the execrable ones are the covers especially those reggae and soul covers. Practically everytime Hucknall chooses a cover it isn't pleasant to my ears, the only exception would be YOU MAKE ME FEEL BRAND NEW which has not been covered by any other artist before, especially not by a white man. The strongest album remains A NEW FLAME, its very nostalgic for me for it came off when I was concluding my college. Mick's co-writing partnership with LAMONT DOZIER (of Motown fame) for two of A NEW FLAME's songs came out truly superb, true classics. SIMPLIFIED is alright, but not a revelation. But the best reason for owning it is the song SMILE. Its a certified masterpiece, one of the finest Hucknall has written along with SAY YOU LOVE ME. Why does practically everyone in here goes agog with STARS when its the most commercial-sounding and crappy album the band has done? How come not one has commended SMILE's presence in this new album when it could even qualify as the year's loveliest ballad in all pop music genre? How it was performed in the CUBA DVD makes the hefty $27. price worth it. That Hucknall chooses to perform in God-forsaken Cuba may not be for the vanity to make a \\"concert venue breakthrough\\" - penetrating a tyrant-ruled nation which is closed for 60 years. He may have been enticed by Cuba's dilapidated charm (much like he was when he stumbled upon Sicily). Cuba looks like frozen in the 1950s, and most old districts around the city looks uncannily like our own Intramuros and Chinatown districts in old fortressed Manila. Hence, if you're a Simply admirer its imperative toget this one, you may not bother with Stars, unless you're just a completer. Thank you listening.

0446608955|5.0|I think this movie was the best movie I've seen in a long time. There are so many good things I can say about it I don't know where to start. The fact that the movie was made in 2000 and I just saw it for the first time this year and I think thats because the previews for it were made to look like a teenage getting into troble movie is why I didn't go see it, but it came on the tv one night and I started watching it and I just could not believe how good it was and when it came on again a few days later I taped it and played it for my Husband and he couldn't believe how good it was. We have watch it about ten times from the day we bought it. The only thing that I was upset about was I recieved the movie in wide screen and we don't have a tv for wide screen. I don't know if I ordered it that way by mistake or it was just sent that way, I don't remember there being anything about wide screen on the ad for it when I ordered it. Anyway it is a great movie and i'm so glad I saw it.
1878424319|5.0|There are a lot of different self help type books out there on the market.  I am a firm believer that you have to be in the right place and find the right book that works for you.  For me, \\"The Four Agreements\\" is my book.  This is a book of common sense information yet written in such a way to proclaim the truth we often miss.  Ruiz also tells it like it is and challenges our core beliefs.  With his nuturing words we are given the opportunity to bloom into our \\"true\\" selves and find the happiness and love all of us are longing.  I am eager to bring his words into practice in my life.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|This is along with Trivium's \\"Ascendancy\\" the best album i have ever heard. I listened to the intro and it has so much feeling I was just sitting there with my mouth open thinking did i just hear that??? The rest of the album is all great, there isn't a bad song, All these things I hate(revolve around me) and 4 words (to choke upon) are the best songs here. This is just a band like I wish there were more off, the screaming is well balanced with the singing (which is great) and watever just get off your computers and go buy this album...NOW!!!
