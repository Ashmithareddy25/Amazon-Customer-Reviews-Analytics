B011YIUL78|4|Have these in the front window of my SUV to avoid installing tinted windows. They look nice, easy to install and to remove when I need to roll the window down.
B00E5NO9DW|3|OK Product
B00SBZRELY|1|when I first purchased, it worked perfect.  Used to fill up my boat and avoid $6 per gallon gas.  Worked well for about 10 uses.  I haven't asked for a refund due to this being about 3 months old so not worth the time.<br /><br />If you buy one, I wouldn't leave it in a can while not being used. Maybe the gas eats the electronics up.  Find another pump.
B009Y7MJVS|5|I got this for my mom when she got a new car and the old one was towed away with her EZ Pass tape in it (that likely never would have come off that window shield anyways). She was leading her car and wanted something that wouldn't involve tape. I read the positive reviews for this and thought we would give it a try, especially with the very reasonable price.<br /><br />Shipping and delivery were timely, with the package in good condition.<br /><br />It has been on my mom's cars (she is now on her second leased car) for several years now, and is still going strong. It holds strong, never falls off, and comes off cleanly. We avoided the mess of peeling off Velcro tape, and when I have recommended it to others who have needed to replace the Velcro tape.
B000CIPU7S|1|I bought four of these. They do not fit my 2011 JGC Overland. Hole pattern is OK but the holes are not in the right position. The overall diameter is too small as well. Had them in original packaging until today... too late to return, bummer.
B00HXC6MNW|4|Had problems with intercom but may have been me. Made a good trip great with brother!
B00PAIMXLQ|5|Holds nicely to the side of the RV and stabilizes the vent.
B000OM8JRU|5|great price
B0009H51PI|5|OEM quality for less
B000UIY5TO|1|Once again it said it fits my car, but had to modify the blower motor to fit my 2002 Buick lesabre when it was tagged saying it was for a 2002 to 2005 Buick lesabre !  Lies !
B000ZB33XK|5|Perfect fit, easy to install, and our separating seats are now much more comfortable!
B007OW672M|5|It works wonderfully!
B00O72R7Z8|5|Works fantastic.
B009S9S0T2|5|Awesome
B004TBOGPG|5|you would think i painted cars for a living,great stuff, great match will get more as needed.
B00K0B4AIC|5|Very nice chrome trim adds a bit of extra value to the car.  Parts fit perfectly, and have gone through multiple washes.  So far, no problems.
B0006O2PBW|5|25 wasn't enough
B00A0J8S8W|4|Looks great - but you need to check how it fits with your existing mounting plate … I had to go and get new screws and adjust with some washers … a little bit expensive for what it is
B00Q8G57Q2|5|works great will return if i need more
B00DR185BU|5|Good
B00A3VUKR4|4|Tanks
B00169LAY4|1|This sensor is not made for 2003 dodge ram 1500 5 7L. You have to purchase sensor from dealer or NKG sensor made for Chrysler. Don't waste your money.
B0049CT60A|5|Great Product
B011EXQV0O|5|I love it! It keeps my steering wheel touchable, even when the temperature in my car soars to over 150°, which is daily this time of year. It looks amazing! Shipping was incredibly fast,  it arrived days before everything else I ordered. It fit easy on the steering wheel of my Focus with some room to spare which means if I ever wanted to move it over to my husbands SUV I have no doubt it would fit. Thanks!
B00JP7PKCC|1|Low quality, one of the caps disintegrated after the first drive around town.
B005UTS670|5|Love the wipers and the color! Great product!
B001UFXTG6|5|Worked great for my 2014 F-150
B00F2MQFE6|5|Work just fine
B004K299JW|5|Awesome tool to have!
B00MB0EDMS|5|Haven't had them from long, but they look so cute! I got two for the front seats and they fit well in my newer Carolla. They don't fit exactly flat against the seat back but once you sit down they stretch with you, if that makes sense.<br />Super cute, good price!
B007IU0USM|5|Best solo rack for the roadstar hands down. Made my bike look so much better.
B000WJX29U|3|Mine lasted 23 months (Sep '13 to Aug '15).  Shouldn't it last a little longer?  That's basically a new battery every year if you definitely don't want to get stranded out away from home.
B000CQDRUM|5|This funnel is great for keeping debris out of all my gas tanks.
B007RY541C|5|Like everything &#34;Balls&#34; makes you get your moneys worth
B000RFUF12|5|Works great and easy to fill the batteries.
B000C2ACA4|1|My car is 2005 Toyota Siena and after installed the gasket, there is a big leak. Not sure I receive a correct part, but it was very bad experience becuase it cost my times and money.
B006FUT09G|5|Best I've used besides Stoner invisible glass. Good smell and streak free
B008RDL78G|4|This rack works great, there is a little noise over 80kms an hour when driving.<br />But is good because the rack fits into the factory roof tracks.
B002NAKWV2|5|Light assembly exactly like original. Once you see the new unit it was easy to determine how to Install.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Anything from Battery Tender is good. No exception here.
B000EQR7XS|5|Works
B001CAR6PY|5|I carry it everyday and it has come in handy several times.  Mostly I use it for the two screwdrivers, but the pliers were useful when I was working on our sprinkler system out in the yard, away from my tool chest.
B0002LWEYC|5|This shade is an exact fit for our Sienna. If you think you can find one that is for your van in the stores you must live in a bigger town than I do. It does take space to store but is the perfect sunshade by far!
B0041QQQ3E|4|Got this on clearance not as short as I had hoped but a great helmet none the less
B009IF1Z1Q|5|perfect fit! easy to install.
B00BSHV1XO|3|Was wrong key, not sure who's fault???
B00U7XT1C8|4|Really good product
B003EO8JEI|5|Really nice fit
B005CLQ30S|5|Cheaper material than factory but for the price, it just can not be beat.
B005JWTMPS|5|as advertised
B00IKKS4W8|5|Great, Better than the original ones on the trailer. I mounted these in front  of the wheels about 11 in. from the spring hangers. Stops the rocking an bouncing of the 34 ft. trailer.
B00QLBNSPQ|4|Works fine
B00KDO313G|5|Excellent quality product.  Fast delivery.  Packaged well.  A+++
B00BJ4EMGO|4|It fits and works as intended
B00CC303H8|2|It didn't work for my Mercedes ML 350 or W166 (2015), tried with and without capacitors. Only worked for 15 minutes and never worked again.<br /><br />HID kits still have a long way to go.
B00AQB19YO|5|perfect link kit at 1/3 the price of Motocrafy
B004FSSI0W|5|Made a big difference in the winter. Stops a lot of cold air.
B00ALPW9EO|5|Took me about 5 minutes to install this onto my 2007 Saturn Ion. Quick speedy delivery. Just as listed.
B00E70LKTE|5|Worked as advertised and easy to install!
B000CP86ZE|5|Everything you read about how well these fit your vehicle is true, at least in my case.  I have a 2014 Fiat 500 and they fit perfectly.  I can't imagine the factory ones, which are 4X the $, fitting any better and they're a breeze to install.
B00JMI1N8O|4|Covers up the registration sticker so hopefully it doesn't cause us to get pulled over. Hasn't happened yet though!
B0016KABFC|5|Great product
B001LHVOVK|5|Perfect price and product thanks
B00YME6LU8|5|I was glad that I found the remote smart key holder!!!  I broke my remote, glued it back together and this<br />little jacket or holder keeps it from coming apart !!!!!! Better than buying a new one from GM for $250.00<br />last time I checked !!
B004D5Q296|5|Good
B001TLJK2I|5|Love the look and feel of these seat covers. Very soft not cheap looking ones. Front installation was pretty easy. For the back took me a while. Package comes with a website that shows you how to install. fhseatcovers.com/installation if your back seat has a seat that folds it has an add on so you can fold it without having to bring the whole thing down. Need to cut little holes for headrests in the back, very easy to do! also comes with 3 headrest covers. Fit well on 07 Scion tC
B00HHVLU68|5|This is the best thing they ever made, I have in in my window and it makes life so much easier, I just leave the Handicap Parking card in my glove capartment for now as I just received this, but just the plastic cover and hook alone is worth the price. I am sure it will be fine once I put the magnet on the console . thank you so much for making a wonderful product at a price we can handle God Bless
B003ZWCB7K|5|My husband was able to replace it himself by just buying this handle AND it works great!!
B004JBR37O|5|Excellent
B001S874F2|1|If I could give this zero stars I would.  Streak and spot free?!!!???  More like make your windshield so spotted and streaked you can barely see out the window.  Finally got it to work in after alternating coke and dish soap.  Took about three rounds of each to get it to each come off or buff to a sheen the way wax does.  Wondering if I'm going to have to do it again tomorrow after it rains tonight.  A horrible waste of money, energy and time.
B00O9Q4FO8|5|Front bra fits great but did not use the mirror covers difficult to fit around mirror
B0000ATZD5|5|This is a great product to secure your spare tire.
B00TREFHW6|5|They look very nice on my car's rims!!
B00G3L6V76|5|Great mount, easy install.
B007AU2YN4|5|Perfect
B0088BX0IM|1|DO NOT BUY! I installed this on my motorcycle and the part that is used to jump start another motorcycle fell off and caught it on FIRE luckily I was able to rip it off the motorcycle before it did any damage
B001B7AQ0K|5|Fast delivery. Perfect part fits and works well in a 2001 Chrysler Town and country.
B003RQBKLC|5|Works exactly as it should! Now I have all my Dash Cams running!
B004AR15ZS|5|Very good, thank you
B001946B04|5|Works well
B0089Q9GOS|5|Just Great buy i recommend
B002PQU6YC|5|After 12 years my 2003 Sierra needed some freshening up, these did the trick. Also put a set of HID bulbs in. Only takes a 10mm socket to complete replacement.
B005345ELS|5|Fits great!!  Good comfortable feel.  Keeps head cool on hot days!!
B000CSZ6VS|4|as advertised, fast service, good stuff.
B007QBY5BG|4|my original spring broke. its fits the car just fine but does not come this the rubber padding that was on the original spring. also these replacements appeared to be a bit taller than the old ones.
B00A8PTLN4|4|Excellent value for the money.  My one complaint is they are slick on your feet if a bit wet
B003YNF4OM|5|Good product
B00VKM3Y3C|4|Fits good. Not great, no hole for the antenna.
B00DDYT7Y0|4|Perfect fit for my needs able to use the 4 way plug to organize multiple plug in emergency lights, now they all come on when I plug in the one cord on the 4 way. The light bar is a perfect fit in the rear window of my 2011 4 door Chevy truck. Only issue is the cord and controller switch on the light bar is too short, but I ordered a extension plug and it worked great. Deluged on time as stated.
B001JT1CEE|5|Used these wires for my speakers that I bought from Amazon, perfect.
B004W9ABC2|4|Good quality and do the job. A little spendy for what you get. But no complaints. I would buy again if I needed another set.
B00DV2CTZI|5|Had a clogged converter due to excessive oil consumption. Car had no power. Put this baby in till I can install a new engine. Engine now revs like new but with alot of blue haze. Product made well, came with bolts, nuts and, gaskets.
B007QXW5W0|5|Very good product.<br />Exceeds expectation
B00LZLBI3G|4|Initial Impression;  Not as &#34;4d&#34; or shiny as I was anticipating.  Not entirely sure if I want to try to use this for what I was intending to (interior trim pieces on my car).  It seems thick, and like it will be hard to conform to curves, but a heat gun will help with that.<br /><br />So far, I'm decently optimistic.  Will update when I use it for something, and let you know how easy it is to apply.
B000ONZT5E|5|This seems to be a good product.
B00Y1HUJYK|5|Good product. Worked as advertised. Went to the local hardware store to get them cut and worked well
B0080HYWPY|5|Works great .. I did end up having it professionally installed by the cruise control store Saginaw MI
B00HD9T2B4|5|This experience was a great one!  My mirror was delivered a day before i was expecting it to show!  Very happy. I will use them again!
B000QILPI2|5|OEM made to fit exactly. Well made.
B00BCRMAQC|1|Is there less then a star? What a joke after one months time. The steering wheel cover in garbage.  Seat belt padding garbage. Rearseat covers garbage. Front seat covers two different sizes.  Will not make another month. My blind aunt with Parkinson s could sew better seat covers. If your thinking of these just dont do it.
B0009IK5US|5|Easy to install, long lasting, great wiping
B004IAB4DK|5|Fits my f150 dash perfect
B00BTGSGFK|5|Arrived Quick and just as described... Would def. Buy Again :)
B005HR20I6|5|Picture is wrong - but these work perfect.
B0010Z4MDK|4|Arrived quickly and per specifications.  Used this to replace the backup power supply for my radio-electric pet fence.
B00824F27C|5|After receiving only one, they sent out the other one. Fits and works as described. Customer service was easy to deal with.
B007Y88AUI|5|Part was perfect
B000A2B0IO|1|No way to keep the water running while washing your hand.
B000CPCC4U|5|perfect
B00AKG7KD4|1|this is a ridiculous price for one shim. My bad because I thought I was buying a pack of 10.  just be sure and read carefuly
B001F212OK|5|Works perfectly for adjusting the suspension on my Victory Cross Country, plus it was less than half the price of the Victory branded one which is exactly the same pump.
B00P3BSDB4|5|Nice
B00ALPW9EO|5|Great .It fit just right easy to put on.thanks
B005UJC1E4|5|Costly, but very good and lives up to all promises. Very convenient  up/down function
B000IYCT1Q|5|Did the job! I really only needed to replace one but I replaced both, good quality, well made, recommend to anyone!
B00FJT0304|4|Works pretty well. Only failure is that it will leak some of the oil out of the handle end if you push it too hard,
B005I02QJK|5|Exactly what I wanted!!!!
B000WJB14I|5|Great for use with a Japanese or European motorcycle - i.e. using Metric bolts/nuts.<br />Works great with Honda for instance, and I keep it in the compartment under my seat, as this takes little space.<br />With that I can remove the fairings, connect/disconnect the battery, remove the oil filter nuts... This is very versatile.
B0043DOTE8|1|I could not use it,Just did not look good for my motorcycle exhaust.
B000C55ZUS|5|stiff, good fit
B001RB44M6|5|Went on easy.  SP forever!
B005HISE7G|5|nice
B00LO0M918|5|They work great in my travel trailer.  They do put off more of a blue light than the normal yellow light of the incandescent bulbs they are replacing, so if you want the warm yellow light, don't get these.  They were kind of hard to get put in, but once I figured that out I'm happy.  And I have a surplus of extra bulbs!
B00PT18QAQ|5|Top quality gauge.  Large, easy to read numbers.  Easy to use with reset button.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Just perfect for lites
B001DKP7JA|5|Fit perfect, took awhile to get but worth the cost. Just wish the impeller was metal instead of plastic. But the original factory impeller is plastic so no issues for me. Good company to do business with, I will again.
B0023VDVGE|5|fit perfect
B004XY9K6O|5|The side panel extensions fit perfect. I keep them on for working on the riding mower plus it gives me a workbench area when working on the bike plus a foothold when I ride the bike up on the ramp....love em!
B0082GKQQW|1|Selected this product as per amazon's recommendation for a 2015 Mazda 3. However looks like it is a miss fit for this model.
B00S5O3DIY|5|Great product, fast shipping, no issues
B00GZ0H9VC|3|Looks ok.  Didn't get to use it because there's no fittings to connect it to a common shrader valve.  Checked 15 different vehicles I have at my shop and couldn't connect to any of them.  So I guess you just have to buy the $400 dollar box of fittings if you want to use it.  But it is nice the the whole top unscrews to dump fluid in instead of one tiny little cap like others I have used.
B00DSD5ASS|5|This looks great.  The picture didn't do it justice.
B000C2WDE2|5|Perfect replacement , noticed old hose was in bad shape when I removed it, ready to blow. This was a 100000 mile preventive maintenance replacement.
B000COC67O|5|works good
B00FNXBTMC|5|My alarm battery back up went dead and this is the perfect replacement for it
B0030CC2XI|4|Pretty nice mirrors
B00BP1YLKS|5|worked great in the camper - all my lights on now draw less power than just one of the old incandescents - great for camping without power hookup
B00D3QUIUA|4|Fit my 2012 vw gti
B0001URFNY|4|Works as advertised!
B008UOLOB2|5|Great product!  Keeps the lens clean and clear!<br /><br />Copy link for more info,<br /><br /> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAijFAHuT0M
B001NZR0HC|5|The best spark plug wire set you can buy for your 1999 chevy suburban with the vortec 5.7 V8 engine. These are made to the exact length and if installed right will give your engine the new factory look it had from the factory. You have to lay these out before installing as each is a different length and don't have cylinder numbers on them. Make sure to use all of the original factory wire retainers and it will come out right.
B000QFORK8|5|Goes on easy, shoes look new again and it is pretty quick to apply. Lexol is always great so I always get it. I shopped around and this is a good price.
B00FFGVLZM|3|It is what it says it is. Wish the black was blacker
B00JIJ4LWW|5|Holy crap this stuff is awesome. I just went on a cleaning rampage.<br /><br />Comes in a large bottle 18oz with an applicator pad.<br />There's simple instructions on the back telling you exactly how this stuff works, very great full for that.<br />A small amount really goes a long way. I was shocked how much dirt came off the couches and office chairs. Looking forward to hitting my Van.<br />Has a very light cleaning smell. Most other cleaning chemicals makes you dizzy, not this stuff.<br />Looks a lot like hair conditioner. Very easy to manage. Drys fairly fast.<br />After seeing how effective this is I'm picking up their Restorer and Spray bottle cleaner.<br /><br />Disclaimer.<br />I did receive a discount to test and review. This did not effect my opinion in the slightest.
B000CGFQKG|5|Fit perfect and was an exact match to the original coil. After removing the coil and bracket from the engine you have to drill out the rivets to install this coil with the included nuts and bolts on the mounting bracket. If you use a topside creeper it will make the whole job go that much easier. Not a hard job for a mechanic but could be a challenge for someone who has never worked on an engine.
B00ENNQHAM|5|Only use kensun products
B00AYR9NIY|5|Excellent product and customer services.
B00261MOLE|5|Perfect replacement for my 2001 Yamaha YZ250  and really nice quality as well.
B005OCJGW2|1|This broke in pieces a week or so after we got it.
B0040QOXDU|5|AAA
B00SB108Z2|5|These look great in my car!
B00Q0DUPK6|4|The right fit easy to install.
B001T9CG9E|5|Best glass cleaner I've ever used, but NOT for use on LCD, Plasma, or Smart phone screens, nor eye glasses.
B00JPJVRKY|5|It looks great and works just fine, thanks
B00QSLNK5M|5|Good buy works great.
B00JA390PE|2|Do not like the white film left on the windshield.
B00DJ5KE9U|5|So far, so good. I use it for a motorcycle battery, maybe once a week to &#34;top off&#34; the battery.
B000C2J7CI|3|works good so far but it was not properly packaged for shipping.
B00C7S9K8Q|5|S&uacute;per i like much
B000VIEDMC|3|These are as described in the ad.  Dark Charcoal Grey and measurements seem correct.  Very Soft.
B0057HPY98|5|Everything OK with them.<br />Fit good, looks good, works good, shipped promptly.<br />Thank you
B00BW6CITW|5|cant beat the price and service
B00DFMFYCO|5|I love this decal. I'm a huge Deadpool fan and this is a nice size decal. Very pleased!
B000CIU8I4|5|This is the second 4601 pump I have installed.  The fist one has been running strong in my 1965 mustang fastback for 15 years.  The pump I just purchased is I my 78 F 250 and it works great as well.  These pumps work great and are quiet.
B000CIE70E|5|Good
B003WOZOUM|5|This product was a total life saver! I was able to move 1070 miles with all of my clothes (in space saver bags) in this bag! It was the perfect solution to moving in such a small car. Definitely use the Right line Gear non skid pad with this!
B005OLSI6I|5|look good
B00W5MG8XY|3|Item arrived on time and in good shape.  It is a little bigger and more clumsy than the one that was stolen from my car a couple of weeks ago and I would prefer a smaller one, but I will use it until I find some other objection.  The biggest disappointment was that I misread the label to be Michelin rather than McLintech and I would probably have more confidence in Michelin.  Me bad.
B00M5FMA9W|3|So for so good.
B0055EALW8|5|Just as advertised. This is the recommended fluid for all new GM automatic transmissions.
B005PD64T8|5|Very bright love it.
B00BO3UQ24|5|Great accompaniment to my bed liner. They even enclose a bit to fit the torques screws in your bed for installation.
B00U1LIG90|5|The price of this adapter/reducer was a little higher than other brands, however Reese is an excellent name that is reflected in the quality of this product.  It appears very strong and is nicely made, without globs of solder in the construction.  The coating also appears to be of high quality. I am using this product to reduce the hitch diameter to fit a Thule bike rack.  It fits both my car's hitch and that of the bike rack perfectly.
B00MGV00EM|4|Looks great on vehicle, not sure if adhesive tape will last, 24+ hrs untouched on installation,
B000FGLQCK|3|Like a large number of users, I was frustrated with the sliding mechanism and the &#34;tabs&#34;.  They look like they should be pressed to release the mechanism to slide.  You quickly discover that doesn't work.  Then you try pulling them up, and sideways and nothing works.  The whole thing seems cheap and you get aggravated and you hop on here to leave a bad review.  I was almost to that point.<br /><br />Then by some miraculous accident, I discovered the counter-intuitive method by which they work.  Too bad the manufacturer doesn't take the time to include instructions.<br /><br />See the little silver tabs?  Grasp THE TAB, and the tab ONLY between your thumb and forefinger.  Do NOT grab the tall black part and try to squeeze the tab with your thumb.  If you just grab the tab, and only the tab, you can slide the mechanism back and forth with EASE.  Try it.  Once you have positioned it where you want, THEN press the tab back into the tall part to lock in place.<br /><br />Two stars taken off for all the aggravation the lack of instructions have caused previous users.  Other than that, it is everything I wanted.
B00MK3THHM|5|It is stated in the descriptjon, it is a vinyl run-on to rub-off too
B003CN30X6|4|They work great. Would be perfect if they came with the Allen keys to put them on. But I have no complaints and enjoy using them.
B009IFIETM|5|fits perfect
B00G8OQZOM|5|If you like your trans and clutch use this.
B000QUN7GI|3|is good product
B0006IX7Y2|5|Fits my dump hose.
B0042KJV9U|5|Works great worth the buy. Shipped fasr git ut sooner than i thought.
B00XICGK2Y|2|It was not high definition
B0009IBJCQ|5|Best battery charger I've ever owned.
B0036GIE80|5|great product
B0043ATM70|4|I find it doesn't last as long as advertised. but for the first 2 months it works beautifully.
B000SL4AA2|4|Works pretty good and fits in my cargo area on my four wheeler.
B005HQ343W|5|Looks great and easy to apply. I've had it on my fiat for 6 months now and it's hold up beautifully!
B00G6MLIPW|5|Very nice.  No change in power or MPG but you can really hear the turbo and exhaust brake.
B000B5ZM6Q|5|fit was good
B003LKAWFO|5|Ordered these for our fridge because they are actually much brighter than a normal night light bulb.
B00EOB6ZMS|5|Replacement crank handles are almost impossible to find except for universals which don't fit well. These Latchwell units are a perfect fit an<br />work just right.
B000C42QVU|5|Good product. The two struts arrived on time as promised but was mistakenly delivered to my neighbor's house. I had them installed on my car this weekend and the ride performance if much better. My car now feels almost as when it was new. I also bought two for the front model KYB 334227.
B007EA6R0Q|3|I bought this rack based partially on the positive reviews on this (and other) sites.  But after a year of ownership, I'm less than impressed.  It's definitely sturdy.  Maybe a little heavy because of that, but not an unreasonable tradeoff.  And it's very, very difficult to actually get 5 bikes on it (though that's probably par for the course for all bike racks--they never easily fit what they say they'll fit).  But it's not nearly as easy to use as competitors.  There are pins and washers and bolts with which to fiddle in order to install the rack, get the arms to lock, get the arms to tilt, etc.  It takes patience and time, which can be in short supply when you've got little kids waiting.  However, my biggest complaint is that the rack wiggles a lot in the hitch.  I thought using a Curt hitch would fit well with a Curt rack, but there's a LOT of play in the rack.  There's a lot of non-confidence-inspiring bouncing going on back there.  And Curt requires use of their separately sold strap (not that they mention that, but it's supposedly in the warranty disclaimer) which helps to stabilize things when you tie the rack to the top of the rear hatch, but its another fiddly thing that takes time and patience.  In the end, I'd look for another manufacturer's rack.
B000E2CVEM|5|So, need quality and stuff that just works great?  Trust K&N with all my air filters, and really like the nut with a pre-drilled safety wire hole for my race bikes!
B00L3T6FCY|5|very nice and fits real nice in back seat of my chevrolet cruze
B00VDQL84M|5|Excellent rocker switch.
B0031I805A|5|Good
B00F0WV0HK|3|I bought this rake assuming it was compatible with the Unger TelePlus ErgoTech extension pole. It is not. But seems to be a decent roof brush if you can find a compatible pole.
B000C9C6M4|5|Right fit & a brand to trust
B0002SRGXY|5|Very heavy duty tool. Should last and last. One improvement of the company would be to be able to buy single adapters for specific needs. Shouldn't have to buy an entire adapter set for one use on one car. I ended up making an adapter.
B00062ZHTG|5|SO much better than the Mr. Gasket junk.
B00NR2FVRA|5|Has worked as well as OEM or better so far.
B008QYX9H8|4|Haven't used it in intercom mode but it sounds fine on my cellphone with both voice and music. The &#34;MFB&#34; is a bit tricky and I've accidentally redialed the last number called by setting the helmet down on the button. Be nice if the microphone/boom was removable or maybe smaller, it gets crowded inside my modular helmet. Installation was simple and quick.
B00FAV24PS|4|Upon first attempt to install they appear to be to small ordered for 2015  Chevy Silverado 2500 LT I was sent covers for a 1500 Chevy Silverado which have smaller caliper. After making contact with seller stated reimbursement upon return of caliper covers.
B0055PCY2W|2|No good
B000XQ0WTK|5|It just works.  I like the ability to adjust the depth of the crimp.  It allows you to compensate for... stuff.
B00029XD62|5|Arrived on time as advertised and easy to apply.
B0068FYXGS|5|Very bright, highly effective and visible front and back
B000S2UGEU|5|Parts were right on time, packaged correctly and worked great!
B00HVI97PI|5|Easy to put on
B00EA2VLE8|5|I got this OxGord 1pc Plastic License Plate Frame with Blue and Black Zebra Stripes for my Rav and although this blue does not match my truck exactly, I think it looks awesome. I love the rich bold color because it &#34;pops&#34; against the color of my truck. I have had license plate frames before that were not made with this quality material. This is very thick and I feel confident that it will last for years, which is why I am looking forward to buying the seat covers as well so that everything matches.<br /><br />** I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B000AB673S|5|Great product. I works better than I had hoped.
B000BRQ0TW|5|fixed
B005JU5WUE|5|I have used the Bosch Icon 28&#34; and 17&#34; on my 2009 Altima for 3 years. When it became time for them to be replaced, I tried the Trico Force, but they were horrible, made a lot of noise and chattered on the glass. I then tried PIAA since I have them installed on my mom's Camry, but they so not properly fit against the glass on the drivers side.  So I ended up returning back to the Bosch Icon. I got them in today and installed. Cleans well, quiet, and no chattering. When the time comes to replace them again in a few years, I'll stick with Bosch. But I do wish they made a Silicon version like PIAA.
B00AOC63NC|5|Perfect nissan titan 04..
B00ZJJFJDK|5|Very good, and Brite
B000GU3KHE|4|The amazon sizing is wrong a medium is very small it was supposed to fit my 1998 Kawasaki 800 Vulcan it doesn't even cover the fenders. Amazon should put what the box says.
B007J5M7P0|5|Good fit made well
B002IATXS0|5|Part was a perfect fit for my US 2004 Acura TL. Replacement takes a whole 20-30 minutes, and the hesitation I was experiencing at highway speed is now gone. Dealer quotes were ~380 for the part, and ~189 for installation. I wouldn't be surprised if this part comes off the same factory line as the OEM part.
B000C9H4U8|5|worked fine
B006FZRBOM|4|this door handle fit my 2002 toyota sienna. I have been using this handle for the past few months and it has not given us any problems.
B00TH41JHI|5|Look and worked great
B00MJ5WX2M|5|Product was even better then I expected.
B005CLML68|5|Good  fit and  timely arrival.
B00F9G8ACK|4|works good so far no problems
B002TMXN6A|5|Very nice fit. Only complaint zero directions.
B0012P1SA8|5|Can't beat oem parts at a get price,  got to love amazon
B00KH9PW3E|5|Good quality, love it.
B0043063JU|5|Well worth the money yes kinda a purple hue to the brown .. But easy to sweep and I had it at a beach area for a week packed away in carry bag ready for next vacation
B005NLQAHS|4|does what it says. gave me the heads up to know if the mechanic was snowing me or actually knew what he was doing and was honest.
B0044XHW6O|5|Simple but perfect for keeping license plate clean.
B00GU8O3CC|5|Looks good.
B00842A7F4|5|Great fit
B005MJYTYC|5|The medium goes for a 36&#34; to 40&#34; chest. Fits right, holds the shoulder in well plus I'm still able to move my arm around like I need to for work.
B00P17M4EC|5|No complaints
B000BUU5XG|4|Two reasons why this isn't a five star review.<br />1. The pieces fit together, but not tightly. I am afraid to leave it all put together for fear it will blow apart in some of the violent weather we have experienced this summer. Thinking about drilling 1/8 &#34; holes at the couplers and a fastener of sorts that could be easily removed.<br />2. The trouble I had with standard and non-standard fittings. My generator exhaust pipe had a tail pipe fitting that directed the exhaust gasses down. Per instructions I sawed this off when I went to fit the standard fittings that came with the kit, they would not fit. The tail pipe extension was too thick, with the extension and the tail pipe. I had to cut the tail pipe back further to get a good fit and then it was too short. So, I had to order another part (Camco 44862 8&#34; 30 Degree EMT) to get it to a length that extended beyond the side edge of the motorhome.<br /><br />Other than these two things, it works great and with the exhaust pointing up, it's not as noisy. Plus no more fumes getting in the coach.
B004TMHF8K|2|Got me a ticket but fun to scare people with
B0027XGFAW|4|It's fan-tastic!
B004BTB7UI|5|On time, good quality, good price
B000HDIBDI|5|Excellent For hooking up,back flushing and pushing waste  to Sewer, by keeping the  line cleaned out at Sites Especially if On a Incline and at all 45 degree Sweep connection.
B00AGAENF2|5|Very good
B000C7VY8S|1|This radiator does NOT fit 1995 SL320 as Amazon claimed.  It also does NOT look like the picture the seller is using, which is the correct radiator for my car.<br /><br />The one I was sent, item # CU2070 has top and bottom tanks, not side tanks as pictures.  I had an older 300D, and the one I was sent looks more like that style radiator.  Top radiator is what I received.  Bottom radiator is the one out of my car.
B0066TJP3M|4|Beware  - Although the photo depicts the lense and socket the socket is not included. Ignoring the socket issue and not knowing how they will perform over time: 4 stars - they fit, they work, and are affordable. The color does not match original.Thus bought another for other side.
B000G6M3VC|5|Works as advertised.  Much more accurate then my auto store one.
B00PZYJE6M|4|Great for riding,won't fall off.
B0009IQZFM|5|Love this towel!!!
B0006V2BPU|5|Good product.
B0034C2WWK|4|Didn't expect much for the price, tag said &#34;Made in CHIAN&#34;, lol...other than that, assembled in a few seconds, minor adjustments with the arms to fit my rear spools, and super easy to lift the back of my bike.  No need to buy stands that cost double or triple the price.  Pretty sure this would last a long time.  Only gripe is that the little black rubber ends came right off, but I didn't need them anyways.  Nothing a little Gorilla Glue wouldn't fix, but I just chucked mine.  Would buy again.
B00QZHNWD4|3|This was nice, but it didn't completely fit the seat.
B005L13QG8|5|Great oil!  Finally a Marine Synthetic I can trust.  My marina previously had been changing oil in my twin Mercruiser 350 Mags with what I thought was a full synthetic.  Apparently, finding full synthetic Quicksilver/Mercruiser oil is hard and very expensive, so my marina was using a blend.  Let me tell you, there is a HUGE difference between a full synthetic and a blend.  Full synthetic does not break down in your engine like conventional oils do.  In the marine environment, and the constant stress a marine engine is under, you want full synthetic.  After about 25 hours on this oil, my engines are running a bit cooler at WOT, and I seem to have gained some gas mileage at cruise.  I have also noticed my starts have been much smoother, with the engine cranking over MUCH easier after switching to this oil.  I am confident I will get a few extra years on my engines running this oil!
B00W4G3WSK|5|This fits my Blitz can perfectly!  Used a 1/2 in drill bit and installed the pop in vent!  I will buy a few more for my other cans.
B00068WU04|2|Fits perfectly in flasher socket in 87 Toyota truck. Hyper-flashes with LED bulbs. Tried EP32 and EP32C...the &#34;C&#34; did nothing, but this one hyper-flashed just as with the original Toyota factory flasher. Returned.<br />Ended up wiring in an EP34 and flashers work exactly as they are supposed to now with LED bulbs.<br />Probably works fine with normal incandescent bulbs.
B00F4PGB68|5|This helmet is 10 times betr thn thee wal mart crap i had at first .
B000RXKR6M|1|It came with the side stitching already ripped.  Tried to use it anyway and it just did a lousy job overall.  Went back to the one I had been using for years with excellent results.  From the reviews and hearing other people say how good this brand is I figured this was a step up.  Wrong, it's junk and I threw it away.  Thankfully Amazon refunded my money so A+ to them.
B000E8OV1M|2|Was fast shipping and went in perfectly but there already making noises and not doing there job after 5 months and only after 2 oil changes...
B00I1OW064|5|The product arrived as stated
B000IYC3HQ|5|Perfect fit, arrived on time
B0079GQKDE|5|So much more convenient than a C-clamp. Work great!
B007V6ZTZ2|5|Beautiful Frame.  Just what I was looking for.
B004JB71J4|1|after i bought for 39$ i wanted to buy another one they up the price to 62$<br />idk why the price not stable

B003S6F3IC|5|Working very well
B0049MIXKO|5|Excellent
B000NDMAX4|5|I actually used this as a shift lever for my MF loader tractor. The replacement switch from Massey was over 300 dollars. this switch clamped right on thye steering column and works great I actually like it better than the factory shifter!
B00RG404OA|1|Does not fit 05 Honda accord 15&#34; wheels. I have factory BLACK DORMAN WHEELS with chrome lug nuts. The center cap is suppose to clip inside the center of the wheel. It does not. I like the black tire look. Kind if like cop car tires.
B007NH8B3G|5|Good part.
B00BGG9JBS|5|Wing window hits it but it looks good and is functional
B000EBKG90|4|Good product for the price
B00695Q3P6|3|Not recommended for fat guys.

B008RUIT1W|5|Thanks
B00192JFI6|5|Great insect screen! Camco has wonderful, quality products. They offer things I would have never thought about being a first time RV owner.
B0021K3IQA|5|A OK
B00Y8TIUUQ|3|Mostly I'm giving this 3 stars because it just doesn't feel very good in the hand. It's very rough texture... kind of like a rough mesh carpet feeling if I had to put into words how it feels. ALso I don't think it looks that great either. I mean it doesn't look bad but I don't feel like it really fits with the look of the car... it's very bulky looking.<br />Anyway... for some that don't mind the texture I see why it could be popular, it doesn't get really hot, but for me personally I'm not a fan, and will be getting a different wheel cover.
B000L50ZVI|5|We have used Zymol wax for many years and consider it to be the best protection for a vehicle finish available. It is easy to apply, resulting in a beautiful shine as well as protection from the elements. Highly recommend this product.
B007Y5A0U4|5|Easy to use, works well
B00042KG3A|4|The jack seems fine, however, one of the pieces the paint was peeling off and I had to repaint it.
B00RO5J3RA|1|Too large.
B002ZS4QCS|5|I bought two sets of these. One for an '07 Honda Pilot and one for and '03 Toyota Highlander. The se work on every seat in the Highlander, but only the rear seats in the Pilot. They appear to be pretty strong and I expect they'll hold up well.
B000BPQGSY|5|theses are great!!my truck drives like a v8 again ,inproved loss power!!
B00ZXD87O0|5|Great
B00B1ZJAFO|5|great product
B006YB2QQU|5|Solved my heat soak problem on 1965 Mustang.  Very smooth start and did not need the heat shield.  So far so good.
B004J9LC96|5|Used these to replace the failed supports on my 2008 Enclave.<br />The originals gave out and the auto lift hatch nearly took my head off one day.<br />I saw some videos on YouTube pointing out the safety concern when these supports fail while the auto lift is still engaged, but honestly it's a ridiculously easy fix. My Enclave has a switch to shut off the lift motor which I did until the supports were delivered.<br />It took about two minutes after they were delivered to replace these, problem solved. I would order two and replace both at the same time.
B002QR76GG|3|Really cute quality  is OK. Not as thick as I thought  it would be but my grandson loves it
B001SLENDU|3|Returned, not what I needed.  Did not work for Toyota Corolla 2013
B00CLX0C34|4|Good wipers
B0041U39AI|5|Perfect fit.  Very pleased with service and quality.
B005HPU15M|5|The drive belt for Delta's thickness planer model # 22-546 that I purchased is a direct replacement for my Craftsman thickness planer  Model#113.275102C 12.5 in. Craftsman part  #821107 which is no longer available from Sears
B00Y85UM7O|2|The picture appears easy but upon receiving the product, the instructions are &#34;SHOW ONLY&#34; with no detail written instructions. Not as easy as shown in the pictures. Place it on incorrectly, the material can tear based on the stretching and the corners of the door.
B00RUDXSNQ|5|These are great, high quality pegs are a very cheap price!! Something I didn't notice (my wife caught it right off!), check the spelling of Harley Davidson on the one side of pegs, spelled &#34;Horley Davrdsan&#34;. I have looked at these a thousand times and didn't notice this! If they spelled it right, these would probably cost at least $100!! NO problem! Exactly as described, very clever! Recommend highly!
B008ESJQ78|5|fits perfect
B0002SA21W|5|Great item for sure.
B000W0RQ8C|4|Have to modify on Toyota hitch. Pin to short.
B000C9I8WQ|5|I brought this because my mechanics said the other one went bad and was causing less gas mileage. I have not had this one long enough to determine if gas mileage has improved.
B00DX8BZR8|4|Works as advertised...no distortion
B002XJNIOG|5|I use my military history to deter thieves; who wants to get badly thumped over a car radio...Right?
B00HP28H38|5|Packaging upon delivery was excellent. Quality of fit and finish was excellent.
B0049HSOYY|5|Exact replacement dont use junk aftermarket parts
B00BX7JVDQ|5|Perfect fit for my 2013 Altima.  Improved power, we'll see about the mpg.  Happy!
B000FPYW4K|4|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B005797JDA|3|Good price, but the tall and short uprights are too far from each other for performance touring kayaks. At least when used at the 6 foot separation I am able to achieve on the minivan for carrying 17' boats.  Seems the design has changed recently. Maybe they better fit the short bath tub recreational kayaks, but my sea kayak required a couple wadded towels to have the hull and deck both come in contact with the foam padding without sitting on the rubber block. OK for using in a pinch when borrowing someone else kayak.
B000BUTDCA|5|Exactly as promised.
B00LML7GJY|5|I keep this charger velcro'd on the dashboard of my car so that it gets the sun streaming in through my windshield.  None of the coatings on my car windshield seem to cause any trouble.<br /><br />I am someone who has more-than-once sat in a parking lot charging my phone because I realized my battery was drained and I wasn't going somewhere where I could charge it.  The typical case is getting to work and having meetings all day where I need my phone with me.  But I also have had to negotiate with my daughter for 2 more minutes in the car while we sat in the parking lot at the zoo.<br /><br />This solar charger has eliminated my parking-lot charges where I counted the minutes until my phone would be back to 10% power.<br /><br />I am not looking to get a full charge on my iPhone with this ... and it doesn't do that.  But that's fine - the value is in having emergency backup that charges without my intervention.  Because it charges while sitting in my car,  it is nearly effortless for me to always have it on hand and charged.  It is *always* there for times when I'm out and about with a drained battery.  I just take this out of the car with me and keep it in my purse, where it powers and charges my phone.  When I get home - it just goes back into sitting on the dashboard - it's not allowed in my house :)<br /><br />I've had other emergency chargers that I've kept in the glove box, but the problem is you have to remember to recharge them and return them to the glove box.  This is honestly perfect for me because the way that I store it and the way that I charge it are the same.  The only thing I have to remember to do is to take it out of my purse and stick it back on the dashboard before going into my house.  And the upside of this being larger and bulkier than the other backup chargers is that it doesn't get lost and forgotten in your bag.<br /><br /> They days of me sitting in a parked car charging my phone are over.  Not sure this is meaningfully changing my carbon footprint, but solar is the reason that this is so effortless even with my scattered brainfootprint, but solar is the reason that this is so effortless even with my scattered brain
B00MGI60RQ|5|Work great and look fantasic inside my European 2014 Ford Focus. Even replaced the parking lights with these.
B010HI8FCO|5|Everything is great.
B000BNZPT2|4|Beats those cheap stick on locks.
B00A36J94E|1|I was under the impression 7&#34; meant seven inches, apparently it means less than 6 inches.<br /><br />Just be aware the size of the decals is not &#34;as advertised&#34;<br /><br />Other than that, they're really nice.
B0045E3MHK|5|AAA
B004OT680E|5|Was a Great buy..!!!!
B000CQI1X0|5|Its way louder than stock. A worthwhile upgrade. You may need to buy a relay kit depending on your car's wiring.
B00MATVMC4|5|nice can we used a safty can for gas while camping for generator
B00D9C2CDO|1|I used this cargo bag once and it got all of my stuff wet.  Some of the black sealant came off leaving the exposure to the rain.
B0089GM636|1|I don't recommend the bag or the company (cycle gear) horrible construction and storage options are limited for the claimed size...... Bottom line hell no ! Ripped after less than three weeks of daily use !
B0049Y9EW8|5|Works great.
B002QJYOXW|1|Great look nice design horrible execution<br />Mirror glass is mounted to a very small anchor has an extreme amount of vibration  Shook so much it came loose when I pushed it back in to reattach my thumb went through the paper thin glass  I don't reccomend these mirrors
B00OYEBUNY|5|Got here on time. Great axles
B003IOKPLO|5|Works well
B00JRE38EA|2|After installing and selling ~1000 (100 ten packs) of these bulbs, I feel I can write a decent review.<br /><br />These bulbs are really quite impressive when they work. They are brighter and more evenly lit than any other 194 5SMD on the market. The white color is very pleasant, neither blue nor yellow. ~5500k in temperature. When they work.<br /><br />These bulbs have about a 40-50% infant mortality rate. Bad ones will start blinking and die within the first month of use. The bulbs that don't die tend to go on and live for years, but it's only about half. If you need 4 #194s for your car, this 10 pack will be enough. Just be prepared to change the bad ones out.<br /><br />To me, the death rate of these bulbs does not equal the light quality. I will not have these on the shelves of my shop any longer. Too many lost hours of labor replacing dead ones.
B000C96F8K|5|Perfect fit. Fast delivery.
B000EDQR4Q|5|Handy buggers!
B00JH0OHMQ|5|first I installed automotive crossover belt and it slipped.  Installed the gates g force belt and it is great
B001JT5IQ2|5|Great!
B004MUIC72|5|just what I needed to fix teh shower in my camper!
B00DZXMURU|5|work as expected
B000GRQIFI|5|Fits our 2015 victory cross country tour with a Lehman trike kit great, I almost went with the trk355 but I'm glad I didn't, would have been too big. Prime shipping was great too had it in 2 days.
B001QWKB4G|2|it was cute and it did not work for very long. the motor on the butt moving stop after a little while. it sat in the box for a while in till i got time to install it on my wife car.
B00JGP8I1S|5|great on sunny days
B00FFAUOPG|5|Perfect fit!!!
B0065WWNNY|4|using this for off road, small dual sport mc.  fits in backpack, but does take a lot of reps to add 10 lbs. of air pressure to my back tire. still better than a hand pump from an ergonomic perspective. because it's small does better on stable ground, else it can get a bit squirrely.
B007RVQYPA|5|Worked perfectly on our 2000 Volvo v70 XC wagon hatch
B00K1N43R2|2|Did not fit car seat
B00JR3RYBE|2|I purchased this as a replacement for my motorcycle since my original horn blew. Fast shipping but I wouldn't otherwise recommend. I connected it and got a quick blurp out of it then it stopped working. I purchased a different one from a different manufacturer.supplier and it worked just fine.
B00BMUJ0RQ|5|works grate
B00EDWF1BE|5|easy to install. Way better than factory hood latches.
B000CEBX5A|4|Wish you had offered the large one as that was really what I needed.  But now I know where to order.  This one is great, just too small.
B000CLZKQQ|5|good swap
B006MX7ZRK|4|Fit the seats very nice good covers for the price
B00JLJI648|1|I don't know it's only mine or not after put it with oil change, oil leaks from between bolt and actual pressure monitor. Please beware you will have chance to get defective one. All 4 quarts of oil leaked and showered with engine oil very fresh engine oil 0w40
B00YYIVH2Y|5|Super quick shipping! Product great quality!
B00LZLBI3G|3|The vinyl was a bit thun compared to others Ive purchased in the past.  The 4D carbon fiber is not as attractive as 3D carbon fiber.  4d carbon fiber shows any errors much more prevelant than 3D.  Combined with thin vinyl, this makes for a trucky juggle.  Heat almost required.
B005BCT058|5|High quality and very easy to install.  Highly recommended seller and product.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Works great!
B001DEPOLC|2|It is well built, but it does not have a latch to keep the lid open.  If you have anything in the lid, it will fall down, so you have to keep one hand on the lid to keep the case open.  I feel because of this, it is porly designed.  I would not recommend it to anyone because of this, this is a serious design flaw for this being a brief case.  I will not buy another one from RoadPro.
B00JEPWODI|5|It did meet my expectations, onky one question, does it have the warrantee it saidithad?
B000BYGGVC|1|Installed and burned out in less than 24 hours tips where gone. Was warned against using these by my mechanic..(they looked very cool) will be removing and sending back. Gave one star only for marketing and design.
B0000AXQE8|3|This thing will not boil water. it just heats it to a &#34;very warm&#34; temperature, which seemed to take about 20 minutes. I think it would be ok if you were on the road and didn't want to stop (a truck driver might love it), but it doesn't make sense for camping or tailgating. If you want coffee or tea then the temperature will probably be fine, but it won't cook your Cup O Noodles.
B008O8YGT6|5|look good
B00LL37F12|5|I bought these in hopes that they would be brighter than the LEDs I had already installed as map lights and the dome light in my 2016 WRX. They are definitely brighter.  As a bonus, they showed me exactly how blue the old LEDs were, too.  I like the look of the whiter light these put out.  Bought some Partsam vanity mirror LEDs to match.  So far all lights are working flawlessly.
B0019I33FQ|5|Great stuff. Quick shipping. No issues. Thank you.
B00FR36MGG|1|This cover had a terrible rubber/petroleum odor when i opened the packaging. It smelled so bad I couldn't even put in my vehicle because I didn't want my interior to smell like it. I let it sit out in the garage for a week but the odor never subsided, in fact, the garage smelled like the cover after a couple of days. I packed it back up and sent it back.
B00O83KNHU|3|Good

B00GSAUHB8|5|Fits my Porsche Cayman well, folds up easily.  Received on time.  No issues.
B00IWXUCB4|5|Thank you
B00TU3V28M|5|I didn't realize that Honda had moved from mini-fuses to low-profile mini-fuses until a bad phone charger popped the 20-amp fuses in both power outlets. Honda provides spares and a fuse puller in the main underhood fuse box, of course, but now I have replaced those, and hae a larger assortment of spares again. Funny that the local NAPA dealer didn't have an assorted selection like this ... and didn't stock 20-amp low-profile mini-fuses at all. BTW, I got these in two days ... really fast.
B00H5JFHR0|5|This was a cure for my halogen headlight problem, good and fast to deal with
B0002UHVX2|3|It's okay.  The only metal is the holding bracket.  The valve and all its parts are plastic.  It should be fine for a while, but I had expected to replace it yet again .... except that I traded the RV for another one.  Not because of this though!  lol
B000OP3H6K|1|More made in china junk!  As universal as a piece of cardboard.  The quality is poor and they aren't even close to fitting a 93-98 toyota corolla.  Should have guessed by the price, and if you need something cheap to throw in a beater car they will work but don't expect more.
B00CF73CRY|1|worst combination of pads and rotors.......all you get is squeal.....stay away from this combination.
B0060LTNDS|5|Delivered on time. Was exactly as advertised.
B004JV6OMO|5|Great product
B00O7XYRQO|5|This magnet is great.  It is a nice quality and very easy to see when on the back of a vehicle.  My daughter is learning to drive and gets very nervous crossing busy intersections without traffic lights, it makes matters worse when people impatiently beep their horns at her.  This does help.  You still will have an impatient person her and there, but I find most people do read this and are understanding of her.
B0058KYUWQ|5|A+
B000E8X4V0|4|fit in car good, but the spring plate doesn't fit over the head of the strut with out  filing a slot to fit thru. rides smooth .
B000S2U49W|5|Excellent product and on time delivery
B009NMWPGI|4|A better than OEM headlight, but the beam was a little muddied and not as intense as I'd like. Make sure you angle these correctly, they are a bit different than the standard H6054 bulbs I took out, but overall, a nice addition to my 1996 Jeep Cherokee.
B000CPHXQ2|5|Fast shipping. product worked as expected. They even look good on my new Nissan Rogue.
B00KP61LIY|5|Awesome and looks great.
B004XAC15K|3|They clean the car pretty well. But can already  tell that they will dry out.
B00FFAUBQ8|5|Nice quality. Inside trim was not tall enough for my thick roof one my Jayco Heritage. Overall liked the product.
B000303YI2|1|Received band new club inside a sealed case, it looked like the paint was already peeling with black residues all over the club.  Opened up the box, the black residues mixed with yellow paint immediately came loose and stained my hands like a leaky laser printer toner.  YUck!  pay more and get a legit product.
B000WJ95G4|5|Sounds absolutely amazing. Deep low rumble at idle but isn't screaming on the highway.
B00537FBIG|5|Fits perfect on my 2015 Jeep Compass High Altitude. Installation took less than an hour. Works great.
B00JQ4FMEU|5|Very good
B005I575FK|5|All I can say is &#34;perfect&#34;!
B000CF6RX2|5|These things are great! I was skepticla at first do to everyone saying that the windows dont fully close all the way because of the window sensors.  But i didnt have that problem except for the very first time.  After that they allways close.  They tuck in the window seem and look slick.  They dont look bulky like the other ones that are placed on the outside.  I would buy again and recommend them.
B0044B30TO|5|Right size , arrived on time
B000PWTHN4|5|worked great, perfect fit
B000FQ7L92|5|This is a solid and heavy receiver shackle. I bought this more for looks, but I certainly wouldn't have a problem using it for what it is intended for. It is very nice and looks great.
B00DNGNF32|5|The items were as described and delivered on a timely basis.
B001GS39NK|4|good price good product

B003175FO0|4|This was what wrong on my bike glad I could get it so fast and at a decent price
B001CUHZD2|5|Awesome
B0029T0S70|3|I bought these towels a few years back and at first they were very soft and plush. Now that some time has passed I feel that I can write a honest review on my experience.<br /><br />I used them primarily for dusting around the house and I even kept one in my car. They work great for this purpose and are soft enough for the most delicate surfaces. I really liked that they naturally held a static charge which aided in holding the dust on the cloth! Unfortunately and to my disappointment, dry dusting is about all I found these useful for.<br /><br />I have bought many kinds and styles of microfiber and these are one of the few that do not work well when wet. I tried using them to clean counter tops and bathroom surfaces but they don't have the &#34;like magic&#34; scrubbing power that a more standard microfiber does. They do indeed absorb liquid but once they get wet, I would describe them like an old fashion soggy cotton mop.<br /><br />The most important thing I would like to mention is that these were never the same once washed. The long fibers became tangled around one another and get worse with every wash thereafter. I wash them in the same way I do any other microfiber which is also the same method the manufacturer recommends on the packaging. Wash microfiber separately from other material types, wash warm with mild liquid detergent and with no bleach or fabric softener. As with any material, microfiber is expected to degrade slowly after each use which is usually stated around 100 wash cycles. I've found that the longevity can vary widely depending on different factors like what you use it for and any cleaning chemicals it comes into contact with.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would recommend these for dry purposes such as dusting or polishing. If you need something for wet use and with a cleaner, I would check out other options.
B00NPYXAWS|5|Great product at a great price. My entire family is now well equipped in their cars.
B00760R6KY|5|Great decal, just as expected.
B000E2D6PK|5|Item delivered on time, was as described
B007AOQW24|5|Awesome floor mats, the best I've ever had. Full coverage. A little pricey but totally worth it and free Prime shipping!
B000OAEN7C|5|excellent. worked.saved $500 on repairs.1998 Nissan quest.
B0000AYD4H|5|Seems to do the job. thats all I was asking for.
B00062YIRS|4|Installed this in my '97 Honda Accord Special Edition (2.2L I4, F22B2) and it performs as expected. This really is a lifetime filter so over time it has saved me money not having to buy $20 replacement filters at Automate/Advance every 6-12 months. When it is time for a filter change just pop it out, use the K&N Recharge kit on it, and pop it back in. The recharge kit is a must buy. It contains a bottle of cleaning solution and a bottle of oil. One kit lasted me years so it's still a good value in my opinion.
B0002Q7ZIW|5|Extremely easy to install
B0054RW1HE|5|Easy install, good product.
B0019IO6X4|5|works like it suppose to, nothing bi
B00H90NWXG|5|Best thing I've got for my Jeep so far! Made a big difference against the sun. Easy to put on too. I drive a lot in town & highway; it stays in place well.
B002FDKPU0|5|TOOO LOUD !!! you need to get a stage 2 silencer if you want to keep a good relationship with you neighbours !
B00O4GPX2Q|1|I bought this to replace my Toyota Camry 2004 cabin air filter. It's not an exact match so there will be about a half inch gap. I ended up filling the gap with cardboard as I couldn't be bothered sending it back. I wouldn't recommend this filter, just buy one that exactly fits the air filter tray.
B0009OMY9C|5|Great service/product.
B001449I5E|1|Wrong part
B008X6QS90|4|Mostly my fault, but these were ridiculously smaller than expected, they're too small to even hold with my tweezers, figuring out how to solder them was quite a task, but easy enough once I had a method down. The size did however cause a few to burn up as a single drop of solder could easily cover the entire LED and melt the top,<br /><br />Overall a decent product as long as you know you're getting some pin-head sized LEDs
B001KSE0I4|5|Worked out great.  Shipping was fast. Exactly as described.  Thank you.
B00K8728AU|5|I purchased this for my 2015 Honda Shadow Phantom.  Fits great!  Ordered the Large size. The description says it's waterproof.  Hasn't rained yet so can't comment on that.  Very happy with this purchase.
B0023VG9TU|5|easy install, 2003 sequoia
B002WHABIU|5|This window regulator fit my 2004 BMW perfectly and cost a fraction of the price of the OEM BMW part.  Highly recommend.<br />NOTE: this regulator does not include the motor - you simply transfer your factory motor to it.
B00B79XIQ6|5|really cute
B000CIXMIC|5|Perfect fit for 2003 Mustang GT.
B00CJ8FAME|4|Did the job and no complaints.  High quality.
B001AM8KAO|1|Did not fit
B00ELASYIA|5|Sturdy cables, great quality! The bag could be a bit thicker but still OK.
B000BZLLTS|2|Made in China just like the ones for 1/2 the cost.  I am paying double the price for the Moog brand and it is still made in China
B002P8UQWW|4|Had to replace sideview mirror after minor accident.  Did the research, checked dealer prices (between $180-$250), read reviews on Amazon.  After careful consideration, decided to go with this option.  Reviewers warned of shaking mirror but liked the price.  For $35, I thought it's worth the try.  It's exactly like others said, and that's why I gave it 4 stars.  The mirror does shake, pretty much at any speed, but it's not really that bad, and it's way better and safer than no mirror at all.  I would call it a minor annoyance that takes a week or two to adjust to.  So 3 stars for the quality of the product.  I gave it an extra star for the price - $35 compared to $200 makes it a good deal.
B005KKR2B0|4|Easy install,  good product.  I put these on then fell over later the same day.  No lever damage!
B007ZHZ7EK|1|cheap junk
B00ZG6JKUO|5|Awesome stickers. Had everything from animated characters to company logos such as McDonalds and Paypal (etc.) Great decorations for my guitar case. Defiantly buying more!
B00D29P5CO|2|was able to install on Honda Odyssey 2011 driver seat and 2nd row seats,  however the material is really thin, fragile, easily scratch able pulls threads ...  2 weeks later already looks bad.  Definitely won't buy it again.
B00029WRKA|5|I've used these before.  After about six years I had one to fly off because the rubber straps had weakened.  I liked them so much that I am buying them again.  Problem; when pulling an RV I need a mirror that sticks out really far on the right side.  I still have not found one for pulling yet.  I've seen them, but they were going in the opposite direction on the highway.  Kinda hard to ask 'em where they got it.
B00HQQXOPO|5|very nice  improvement
B00D44733Q|5|Good fit.
B002LF7CIK|5|Love it!
B0026CG5S6|5|I love the inside channel fit ...hugs cab better and less area to get caught in tree limbs
B000EEU0IO|5|Just what I hoped for.
B0009V1WSE|3|appears cheaply made, but works OK for my purpose as a deterent.
B004GCEQ08|1|Compared to OEM this bumper is a joke.  It's a fraction of the weight of the original. A grinder cuts it like butter, the original was like grinding concrete.  I regret purchasing this.
B00LIXEWXO|5|Excelente
B007SQZV9E|5|Love kt!
B00KTHYAUU|5|Works great.  Identical to my original toyota remote.
B011BIEST8|4|Mounting tab that screw went through to secure module to car was broken, but the unit functions as designed. I did not contact seller about damage because my a/c wasn't working and I could not wait for a replacement to be sent. Overall I have no complaints with the product, only the shipping.
B000JFJLP6|5|Hubby bought this to power his CPAP for a week-long Boy Scout camp. He loved it! Ran it for two nights then recharged in the dining hall during the day. Slim profile made it easy to pack.
B003ZNTFE6|3|Lights look great high beam work excellent but low beams seem like they hit a wall about 25 to 35 out makes it a little dangerous to drive something has to be fixed.
B006DDHZ1K|1|Low quality.  One out of eight was defective and failed after 10 days in service.  Expensive proposition for dealer to diagnose and repair ($350).  Avoid this product.  It is manufactured in Mexico.  Amazon refused return to add insult to injury. UPDATE: 21 months later another 5 of the original 8 failed w/ high resistance.  Made in China?  Made in Mexico?  Who knows but I only buy from local auto parts stores now to avoid counterfeit goods...
B00GD8CMDQ|1|Wrong drain plug washer - it leaks. If you get this, be sure to get the correct drain plug washer elsewhere.
B00OTISIVC|1|Lasted about 3 seconds.  I hooked up quick to see if it worked. It did for approx 3 whole minutes.  As i fiddled with the very small wires on the back the ground came off. That was the end of it.  My only recommendation is that if you one of these small meters make sure it has a dedicated connection point on the back with a removable connection or screw in leads.
B00FC22LZ8|5|Great product. Would highly recommend. Like others have requested, please do adjust your headlights so, it does not bother/blind the other drivers.
B008FCCO72|4|Fit perfect
B000CF7CVI|5|Works great. No issues.
B006X8ALY8|5|Got what I needed without the dealer charging me an arm and a leg

B000JFNAJO|5|Works like new
B003VDX5D2|1|this things all rusted already after a few months<br />and I'm afraid to use it with my weight at 240 its liable to fall apart,<br />1 star is too much to give
B0068C7066|5|I received when I was told it mounted easy and has been great for 500 miles.
B006TMOWAW|5|good quality
B00WRWYLJA|5|Exelent
B00I8Y3WWS|5|Great.
B002YFDYIE|5|Best intake For a DURAMAX make sure you get the white dry filter with the pre filter sock. The red oil filter will ruin your turbo
B00BQVF8J0|4|works perfect for the 5.5&#34; CG pads
B0031GJ7KE|5|perfect thank you
B00T36MMXU|5|I used 3/8&#34; stainless steel bolts, washers, and nuts to mount these bars. It made a stronger and tighter job. I did not like the<br />supplied hardware. These bars look great on a 2015 Colorado.
B003VV3TYO|4|Great fit, good product!
B004ZF39ZY|5|These are the most amazing headlights I have ever seen recommended to anyone who wants bright hids.
B00FE26CAG|3|Some of the screw holes underneath do not line up properly.  Have a drill bit ready to make some new holes! Doesn't fit that well but for the price, eh.
B00757KJTI|4|Works ok. Most importantly it clears my garage door.
B00414HVJO|5|Exactly what I wanted and great service!
B000C30J7O|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B000GQ6LF6|5|All the holes lined up great which made the install easy.
B00LQIGPOU|5|I love it. I love my Bichon&#34;s  and have gotten many complements on it.
B00WKXPJIS|3|wish it fit just a tad larger it just barely fits my truck.
B004ZHANQA|4|Only lasred short period time begore scuffed
B001NJ3H0C|4|works fine only time will tell life expectancy
B0113BIJ2K|5|Very satisfied with the product
B009UX4FWM|5|Product is second to none. Must be used in combination with colonel brassy.
B0031XI514|3|It works fine
B0018F3EG8|1|This item is a joke way to small can't fit anything inside not meant for a motorcycle maybe a kids Bicycle What a joke
B00V97KY90|5|I ordered these for my husband what I paid for two was much cheaper than what they wanted at the dealer or anywhere else for one and it was the exact same item and easy to install
B00HTSFWWW|5|looks very cool on my black 4x4 silverado,better then stock
B00O9PTYF4|3|Works OK but a little dry for my tastes. I get better results using the wipe in addition to soap and water.
B0066SJWSG|5|The part came on time and fits on my '05 vw jetta. Very satisfied with the purchase.
B00HXC8Q4A|5|Works as it should.
B000HBNUTA|5|Works great, dries fast.
B00BJ4BLMC|5|The only filter i use on my ford f350 super duty is this one!  I buy this and use the T6 synthetic oil.  Never had a problem with this filter and have found that the oil last longer with this type of filter versus any other brand.
B007P74B0Q|5|Great deal. Good product
B000C40RW0|5|As with the shocks, these are very heavy duty and rugged struts, at the best price around.
B00F8PSWR0|4|Its good tint. But shrinkable was alittle completed, but good otherwise.
B000C2SH1K|5|Excellent !
B0031GWMI8|5|still working ..
B004J6FFVA|5|Easy to install and they look great.  Even the Sears guys can't break these when they rotate my tires!  I've had these for 3 years now and they are experiencing minor pitting in the plastic - but that's the tough New England salt and whatever they treat the roads with.
B007393QRA|5|Awesome product
B002AMEU70|5|also great
B00BJN07TQ|5|I actually purchased this for my girlfriend.  She was missing the passenger side visor.,..and this worked perfect
B002X1NLOQ|5|Perfect fit. Glad it's made of metal.
B00EC2CG9U|5|These are the best bungies I have ever  used.  I like these better than the thicker ones.
B00F2ZH9UW|5|great product. Makes my stihl edger, blower, and chain saw run much better than mixing the oil
B008GNG5LG|5|Good price and good product
B001DKPXU8|5|the best
B00B22FA28|4|Head works great but had to replace valve seals after warm up. One valve seal spring had broken allowing oil to pass thru and a couple others looked ready to break
B000C8TA2E|5|Well made! It comes sealed in a plastic bag. Ordered this and the Purolator BreatheEasy at the same time, returned the Purolator.
B0000AYZAC|4|Wires are a bit shorter the OEM, but functions fine.
B00BFDHJ1O|5|I exchanged a sensor using basic tools. He was chosen well so it works well.
B00HVM4DB2|5|The color of this product matched perfectly and it was very easy to use :) I would highly recommend TouchUpDirect to anyone in search of touch up paint to help resolve those minor blemishes that stick out like a sore thumb!
B011ERI1NA|5|Delivered on time and easy to program.  Very happy.
B00C80HSU0|3|Light was bright when it worked however it stopped working in a few weeks for no reason I would still recommend it if you don't mind replacing it.
B00355JQ52|5|Easily left a great shine!
B00S8P91N6|5|Installed and works fine
B00PUOQRK8|5|I love this. My car has upholstery that has a net-like appearance and is uncomfortable to sit on. Hurts the back of bare legs. This is thin, but works great. Stays put with the rubberized backing and is not hot as I thought it would be.
B009OBVROY|2|Figured I would give it a try for bug junk stuck to my Challenger SRT8's frontend.  Didn't work very well.  Took some things off i guess.  I have used other homemade remedies that work 10 times better that cost pennies.  I would skip this and just use a spray bottle, vinegar and dryer sheets.
B00IITUPCS|1|I got this for the high temp rating to use on my motorcycle but.found out it didn't work and lost all pressure in front brakes after using this fluid.  Had to run to a gas station to buy a $4 bottle of DOT 3 which worked fine.
B0088P8E20|4|Installed on 2004 BMW 325i.
B00W0C9Y26|5|Fit perfect for application
B006WAMMOO|1|Did not fit!
B000VTY04C|5|Arrived timely and excellent price.
B004WO91V4|5|Great shocks on a 2000 Jeep Cherokee XJ - they smooth the ride, but feel tighter and more controlled, just what you expect from Bilsteins.
B0010GGH14|5|Right Product !
B001ECWMPY|5|Installed myself on a 2000 Monte Carlo. Worked great and easy install if you know what you are doing. Remember to get an alignment when you are done.
B000CO86BY|5|Very strong but light at the same time.
B00UHD4HJA|5|Phenomenal deal here. High quality stickers, dope designs, and very affordable price. Will be purchasing again.
B007HGF398|2|An important fixed mounting screw with hole in was missing, very bad!<br />I had to create a new one screw to get the cover to be stuck on the roof
B008G3A5F8|3|broke within first 6 months.......
B000C5E00E|5|Works great!
B000EQTRWC|5|quick, as advertised and worked fine.
B002TV7TW0|5|look good
B006QZLH32|5|Worked as advertised!  Great power increase and broader range of response.
B01078GH6A|4|Hangs really well on the back seat of our Toyota Highlander.  My husband (who is picky) was impressed.  We both agree though that it could be a little deeper, as we make a lot of trash on our trips.  But honestly I don't know if there are any deeper.  Plus all you have to do is empty it at every gas stop.  The width is perfect. It's easy to unsnap the bag to remove it.  The plastic bag holder is a novel idea.  Worth the extra money.  Later I might stuff a few grocery bags in there when I run out of the bags they provide.  I do not like that the plastic bag doesn't hang perfectly in the back because of the straps.  I don't know how they could design it differently, however.  That is why I am knocking one star.  The bag sometimes falls inside when trash is put in.  Of course you don't HAVE to use the bags too, as the lining is waterproof.
B000XQ9MGE|5|Great tool. I used it the other day to start up a stranded motorist who couldn't get started with a normal jump from another Samaritan. Worked like a charm. I haven't had to use it for my truck as yet. Seems that just carrying it in my truck has solved the starting issues I had. ;]<br />It indicates when it needs to be recharged, which it rarely needs and which I do off of my Belkin 300w 2 Outlet Dc/Ac Inverter right inside my truck.
B002J85826|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B00JG2EPZE|2|The antenna cable (RF cable) that came with the antenna had a broken center conductor. I expect a perfect product condition that I paid for that is inspected prior to shipping.
B004JB5GWS|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B000WJF7FC|5|This is a just a good alternative to an expensive alarm system that will just drain your bike battery.  This is a must if you have a 2000 dollar comuter bike. The alarm's sensitivity is perfectly callibrated so as not to activate in a wind gust or when unlocking, if your carefull, which would be very annoying and draining on your 9 volt.  This alarm will be effective if someone were to tamper with it, ie. try to cut, pry or hammer it. This lock is meant to be placed around the rear frame, through the wheel, with the electronics placed under fender to keep components out of elements.  It would be best to use in conjunction with another lock or post ancored to the ground.  If you dont play with this much, witch is very tempting, that 9 volt battery lasts for months.  I 've had this for a year and still on the original battery.  I use this confidently on a motorcycle.  Mostly for work within 100 yards or so and the remote works fine. Also set it up at night time and the vibration wakes me up.  So far I feel secure with it.  Only set off a couple times. Mostley kids messing with it.  Anyway I'm glad its not anymore sensitive.  Perfect for me.
B001TKWRHO|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B00JIDIQCO|4|Everything ok
B00D9C2CDO|2|If you need just a bag for dry days, works well.  As soon as it rained however I quickly found out this was not waterproof and of course Amazon won't accept a return because I planned ahead of time and ordered it 5 weeks before my trip.
B0049E7HLS|5|Sooooo much better than rebuilt! No leaks, no drama, no problem!
B00RWWZ7P2|5|Great!!
B00AL1KK9Y|2|I return the item, its too big... very dificult to fold.
B001FJQU40|5|Fit Perfect
B000NU5NJ0|4|Got it, suppose to be genuine.
B00B7GRFS6|4|they fit perfect.  They cost more than the emblems!  Cost is the only negative when you have to put shipping on it for these little guys.
B00381BS3Q|3|The product itself worked as described.  I am only giving it 3 stars due to the fact that the bottle arrived leaking all over the plastic bag in which it came.
B000L7JQMU|5|With a paint protector, does a good job of moving the door frame out enough to insert the air wedge to unlock the vehicle.
B000ABE9BK|5|Cement driveway oil spills, cleaned up nicely (with some help from Simple Green and boiling water from a tea kettle). No pressure washer needed.  Wish I knew about this stuff years ago!
B002HAREHI|5|Worked great!  Took 15 mins to install and saved a ton of money.
B00PJPHEBO|5|Works with my 2003 VW Jetta. Paired with my phone just fine.
B002IV8CI6|5|Great product and outstanding customer service
B000C9FSH4|5|Great product. great price.
B00LSFWE1O|1|These bulbs don't work in Hondas, did work in a Toyota. But you couldn't tell because the are so dim. I think want my money back. I'll stick to.my HID lights
B004XH7RKM|4|Works for my 2015 Jeep Compass High altitude. 4 stars because instructions were lacking a little detail. Grounding screw was a little small and did not &#34;bite&#34; well so i used a bigger one that I had on hand. Other than that works great.
B004VQMA48|5|Looks great and easy to install. Very satisfied.
B00MKAQMEG|5|GREAT PRODUCT !!!
B00KIERDDU|4|Works great
B005RUNMU8|1|Honestly, I hated it, the stupin annoying noise was too much for me to even want to keep the thing, I ended up giving it to my friend for a can of butane. Its awkwardly small and the flame is small too. If there was at least a way to shut off the noise or even take it apart to do it maybe I would have kept it. It looks good though.
B00KQXYSR2|5|sturdy detactable 3rd unit nice feature held many time without bending
B002PL59RG|5|fit and worked fine
B00ELR3XM0|5|Very satisfied with my purchase. The lift supports fitted as original equipment. I did recommend to friends and family.
B000CB94PY|5|My order was received on time, in good condition and as ordered. Mann is a good name brand I have used for years and its always good quality at a fair price.
B009DJ37ZE|4|2011 Malibu 2.4. Increased mileage by about 2-3mpg. Throttle response increase is minimal. Dyno readings did display increase in hp by about 5. Overall great product for what it is. Saves money since it is a washable. Exact same as k&n
B003E1Q952|5|Very please with quality for price with this drinking water hose, which was available most quickly from WalMart website.  The hose is lightweight, attractive, and flexible without kinking.  The fact that it is drinking-water safe is the most pleasing feature, which makes it fun to use and gives us a better feeling watering our plants and garden.
B00IZR6D9C|5|Amazing performance
B004NY1YYK|5|These covered up some nasty scratches on my new ski and look great doing it.
B000TYQB14|5|I have read the reviews, some positive some negative. as far as i am concerned, this product is awesome. came with everything you need except the rubber housing, but not a problem, mine was intact and the product is great and 30 plus dollars cheaper than getting it locally and i got it delivered on a sunday. can't beat that. thank you amazon. again you have proven to be the best
B002HXXO0Q|1|Not very user friendly item,,hard to install.
B001JT5JVQ|5|Love this stuff! Puts an extra shine on your car!

B00MEMEFWQ|5|Easy to replace. High quality and at a great price.
B008BLNXR2|2|I knew these would not be very dark from reviews and I have a heat gun but this was impossible to get on my headlights. They are long and have a progressive bend so light blue and good for flat surface only
B0055AYUEW|4|Worked perfectly.
B00EY924F2|1|Half of the lights stoped working after 2 days.  Poor Quality!
B004GGULK8|5|fit perfect
B00EAJVT4S|5|Fit my 04 Shadow 750
B000HDIP9I|5|Great service/product.
B00XPTJGZS|5|It did the job.  What else can you say about s tailgate strap?
B00B32DDOE|5|works great all parts fit
B000HTNPLU|4|A little thicker than other flushes that I have used. I was leary of the thickness of the flush but it seamed to work ok.
B00QI7FPM2|4|This really works! Only reason it's not getting 5 stars from me is because I had to drill in to my vehicle for it to hang properly... Besides that thumbs up!
B005GNUOTS|5|Nice little ashtray.  Smothers the cigarette fairly quickly and is virtually smoke-less (once closed).  I highly recommend.
B00ID7EDRI|1|Warning! This item does not fit all 2012 Highlanders. I just burned an afternoon trying to make this work on my 2012 Highlander Limited. The factory plug doesn't match the convertor harness.
B00E63TI32|5|Keeps water really cold even in Florida summer heat on the tennis courts.
B00JA39676|5|I purchases the 24&#34; and 19&#34; PIAA Aero Vogue Silicon wipers for my mom's 2005 Camry. It has been using Bosch Icon wipers for the past 3 years and have worked well, but a recent storm cracked the windshield and had to be replaced. When that was done, I installed the new PIAA wipers. They do an amazing job since they are made from silicon. It cleans the water off, does not streak or chatter, and there is no noise. It was a toss up between the Aero Vogue and the Si-Tech, but the Aero Vogue is still made in Japan while the Si-Tech is now being made in Vietnam (lower quality).<br /><br />On a side note, I did try PIAA wipers on my 2009 Altima. The Aero Vogue 26 or 28&#34; on the drivers side and 17&#34; on the passenger side, but due to the curvature of the glass, several inches of the blade do not even touch the glass. I then tried the Si-Tech 26&#34; and 17&#34; on the Altima, and they do it and make full contact with the glass. But when used at high wiper speed, part of the wiper place arm is turning under and makes a loud squeaking noise. So I ended up buying a new pair of Bosch Icons for the Altima.
B004SR7KCC|1|On March 4th 2015 I purchase this product for my 04 Honda Odyssey. It was working fine for about 3 months. Very disappointed with this product because my rear vent window doesn't close it a problem when it rains....would not recommend this product....0 Stars!!!
B002HK2892|5|Couldn't be happier. Product fits great, looks great, and the price was reasonable.  Was surprised at how nice these look.
B00466V9AY|5|simple to program
B00M78820I|5|“ It is great. I ordered several more as gifts. ”
B0039BU4OO|5|Authentic BMW mats

B003CK3PN4|5|Great product
B00FDW57VC|5|Exellent!
B00KH9URJI|5|Great product.  Especially for vehicles that aren't at stock ride hight.
B001F0NNR6|5|Worked great thanks
B000CMFT02|3|OK. Didn't fit well.
B00PQ7Z0BQ|3|This is a god product, however, after having them for 4 months the batteries on all the fobs are dead. We have only used the key finder once or twice in those four months, so I didn't expect it to drain the battery this fast (seeing on how I use my key fob for my car keys daily and only replace the battery every 18 months or so). I'm ordering batteries today and hoping this is a fluke, but if it's not I will be ordering a different key finder :-(
B005SEJTYG|5|Use 7 quarts along with Liquid-Moly in my Tundra. Does its job and actually quiets down the noisy Piston slap/diesel clattering noise of the 5.7 Tundra engine.
B002ZTNWVS|5|its automatic to get them for us in Cleveland OH
B0034KU8OQ|5|Worked fine
B004OCM0C6|5|Works great on a light pop-up camper. No reason it wouldn't do well on something heavier. Nicely finished product.
B000JZYV2O|5|This is a quality vent shade at a very good price. It makes my 8 year old Avalanche look years younger.
B00J8RJRIW|4|Everything ok
B000B8JUNY|5|Fits as expected. Haven't had any problems with the cap -- some people told me to buy OE as non OE parts might set off check engine light. I will review this review if the problem occurs.
B00M9FDE5M|3|The amp made it louder but speakers distort .the speakers sound as if they are inadequate for the power. I expected more for the money. kind of a big let down.
B008BC8EW0|4|Obviously easy to install if you own a socket set. Had issues with it opening outward on the 1st push. Note: Do not try to open it in your hands. Bolt it 1st. Then open. Over all, other than Made in China. Bang for your buck I gave it a 4
B00O586MRI|1|Bad quality paper.  It gets lots of bubbles.  Imposible to install correctly.
B002EFBH4W|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B0002NYBPA|4|Christmas stocking gift last year for my husband - likes it but doesn't use it often
B006X8ALKM|5|Fit and looks great!
B00ASN0B1M|5|2005 FJR 1300 direct fit perfect same as OEM.<br />Fairly easy install used a multi yellow hex tool for the stainless screws on the fairing probably metric and a ten millimeter open and box end wrench for the battery terminals. I also have a battery tender cable on mine o yeah and across the top of the battery metal strap is hex tool also. 10 to 15 minutes install. Bike started up perfectly I topped the battery off with a smart trickle charger as always seems to work for me makes the batteries last longer if you give them some love initially and a few times per year when not in use. Nice price 8-22-2015 free shipping  $46
B00L9A38GS|2|Cheap copy of the original. I had to trim the edges. We will see how long it lasts. My HRC sticker I got from a Pride festival lasted for 5 years.
B00K9TCW3U|1|Much smaller than I expected.
B000C7TU7K|5|seems to be an exact fit thank you its working well so far
B000CMHIR4|5|Great filter in my 2015 Focus ST. Didn't notice any performance increase, but the sound is phenomenal. Even with the stock airbox cover in place you can hear the bypass valve. Easy to install in about 5 minutes. Would buy again.
B00J99774K|5|great pump. pumped a tire in 5-7 minutes
B00GSAUHB8|5|I got one for my husband and one for myself and we like them a lot!! Great coverage!! And definitely keeps our car a bit more cooler. Where we live temperatures can be from 105º the hottest to 98º. We are happy!
B00IR70QB6|3|slight 2mm to 3mm gap from edge of outer line from original emblem, but will have to fill in with something.

B00RPPYMC0|5|ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE FOR YOUR 2015 WRX!!! AS SOON AS I INSTALLED IT I COULD HERE A NOTICEBLE DIFFERENCE IN THE TURBO BYPASS VALVE AND AIRFLOW INTAKE. THE POWER GAIN IS ALSO QUITE NOTICEABLE AS WELL AS THE SLIGHT TURBO LAG BEING SIGNIFACANTLY REDUCED. OVERALL GOTTA HAVE IT.
B00HZTDKZG|5|I've only had it for 2 mths,I like the smart chargering feature stops charging when charged  & not over charging avoiding damaging battery.<br />I'll comment in future if I have any problems (charging in winter battery outside riding mower).
B00TA5ECJQ|5|Very high quality siphon pump. Needed this as a foot-pump for a hand-washing station and it works like a charm. Wish the tubes were a little longer, but can't complain.
B005NLQAHS|5|Does what it is supposed to do.  No problems.  Used it in conjunction with an app I bought for $5 and it works perfectly.  No issues at all.
B005PYHYK0|5|Great Seat covers, Good fabric, easy to customize especially the back seat.
B00DBEMVMM|3|The item came on good timing, but the reason why I order the lights the second time because I really love those light and there already blinking even the ones I just ordered are blinking.
B002YKGETA|1|THIS ITEM HAVE NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL I WAS EXPECTING THIS ITEM WITH MANUAL
B00NUJ2NWQ|5|easy installation and work great!  So glad to buy Made in USA
B004HUGGWK|5|I got my seat cover fast, and looks great
B005NLQAHS|5|Product was easy to use and informative when looking up CEL codes.Downloaded Torque app for $5 only thing I was skeptical about was the HP readout. Seemed bit out of sync or not true reflection of actual performance, even though all my settings were correct.. But then again that's something to do with the app, not the device.
B000FGEF50|3|the door comes off very easy when you open it
B00JAR6LXY|4|cheap price, fast shipping, the only downfall is that a lot of people have this in my area...
B002TO86NS|4|This item has good clear sound, my only concern is that the ear pieces may bother my ears on a long trip.  That's no fault of the manufacturer its just me.
B00GHT6SF4|5|Perfect fit. Looks like new
B000UUMM6K|5|We have owned 8 different RVs, ranging from Motorhomes to Pickup campers!!  On every one of these we have put Maxxair vent covers.  We love them!!!  So when we bought yet another RV.....had to have a new one on it!!!
B0084UJZ54|5|They fit like a glove on my 09 Chevy Tahoe. I haven't had them for very long but I'm positive they will do their job year over year.
B00R8O8I78|5|Good quality leather and fit great. Price was too good to be true well worth it.
B000FW7V3C|5|Great
B00523AMBC|5|Works Well with my Set ups.
B005S58V26|5|This made the job of wiring a 2011 Murano as simple as possible.<br /><br />Be sure check out on line videos for the vehicle that you are installing this in - this is particularly helpful when needing to remove interior treim, cowlings,etc to access wiring.<br /><br />Nissan conveniently places a hot wire connector in the back end so there is not need to run a separate power line to the battery.
B001DCEV2C|5|Exact fit pierburg valve in the box
B009DJR0V6|5|I purchase these Headlights for a 2003 crown vic. Both RH and LH. They were very easy to install. Perfect fit just like OME. For the money I am very happy with the purchase. No problems with adjusting the light to correct angle. I also purchase new bulbs to install when I installed the headlights. Improved night vision greatly.
B00UGJWPXU|1|This item was not as advertised, when returning I had to pay to ship it back when it did not fit my vehicle.
B005OURT5A|5|Fits like a dream 2008 silverado with 5.3 lower oil cooler line

B000FW2MWW|5|A real battery saver
B000RN04VU|5|Excellent, quality bag for a very low price! Fit my luggage rack on 2015 Harley Softail Slim perfect! Was looking everywhere for a smaller bag for items like Ipad, a few clothes, etc. This one is perfect for my needs!
B008B4M4QA|5|Chatter and clanking is a common problem in this type clutch...this is a direct replacement and only takes 20 minutes to install..most of that time is taking the chain cover off..four bolts..my 14 yr old grandson had it done before I finished the funny pages and coffee..
B005C0FBOI|5|Much better price than local parts store prices.  On small bore hose, this design is superior to conventional gear clamps.
B000W0RQ8C|5|Works very good. No problems
B000AM8BCC|5|One of the only engine treatments I've ever found that makes a noticeable difference. If you are hearing ticks or losing power or compression, try restore before going the expensive route.
B0015KLVCK|5|Mounts easy, looks great, wife loved it! If she's hapy, things are great, LOL!
B005UGIW86|4|Well made, does what it is supposed to do.  Easy to fit on with a little handsoap right over the shifter.
B00C5T2W9G|5|Our trailer hitch cuupler was damaged and we needed a quality replacement. The Atwood 15775, was vey easy to install and very solid material, not cheap, thin metal!
B00DBEPEV2|2|they do not work as the original bulbs, bad choice.
B00YI8E560|2|Way too blue. That's super illegal. Also, the brightness is pitiful.
B00YFSAN1E|5|Very nice for the price; my 24year old son uses in his civic
B000CB3X7O|5|Perfect, these are NOT that easily found these days!!
B000B5ZM6Q|5|All good
B008CSFJIU|5|Great combo
B005CLL4WK|5|Exact fit and looks great. Almost better than OEM.
B000S2U5MI|5|Thank you
B00A8MZ7IA|5|If you care about your car get some real micro fibers chemical guys deliver.only hang dry them and they will keep a nice soft feel
B00SR2DAF0|4|These lights are good, bright and the chrome looks good.  This is very cheap plastic and the chrome is not done perfect either but you have to nit pick to see it all.  The plastic is thin, it is a game with mounting because of the strength of these units.  They could use a plastic button on the front lights to fish the cable through to prevent water from getting inside but for this price we can do that ourselves too.  These ship directly from China, west of Hong Kong.  The shipment from there to New York is faster than from New York to your place but that's our post office.  If you thinking about who is getting your business and money note this seller is the Chinese government.
B009YN13CS|5|Awesome<br />I had factory 12&#34; this 10&#34; is very nice
B00B2AEKSK|5|Very satisfied
B00BYH6C1E|5|Love them.  They fit well.  Bo more loosing items
B001DBTVGO|5|Looks a lot cleaner than a plain white air filter. Love the look, not much difference In performance
B0006JO0XI|5|8&#62; Thank You $$$ 8&#62; :D ^^
B00DWVNBIC|5|Works perfectly for both fog and offroad lights.
B00UB5E5TG|1|The sticker is without a doubt cool looking. However the decal is too weak to come off the clear side of the tape. As you put the decal into position and pull back on the clear tape holding the decal. You CANNOT get the decal to come off. the clear tape is too strong and the decal is too weak. DO NOT BUY THIS. IT WILL NOT WORK.<br /><br />Sorry POOL fans. I was pi$$ed too.
B00D3YEGO6|4|The product is great!  Downside: Screws didn't fit the car, had to spend extra money to buy the correct ones.
B00WYO2R6K|2|very disappointed this should have a case as if you accidently hit the led switch it go's on a hard case would prevent this or a recessed /slider switch  .and it should com with an ac wall charger and a car charger they don't make a hard case to store this safely.....with the accessories ...
B00584VS86|5|AAA
B00KTIUG5C|5|Work great. They were as simple as it gets to program for car remotes, took me all of two minutes on both. Work just as well and seem as good of quality as an factory branded remote.
B00J3DB98M|5|Great!
B007AE1X8C|3|Fitment wasn't correct. Returned without issue
B0081SCR1S|5|fantastic

B003VAUK4W|5|This product is very strong.  Delivered on time.
B008MISDH4|5|Works as it should.
B00G9SB45M|3|They gave me my money back.  It wouldn't work submerged at all. Leaked like a sieve the first time I put it in on my boat trailer.
B00IS94NKS|5|Nice mirror covers, takes a little care to put them on right (starting at the top and pulling them down over the back of the mirror).They attach with 3M (red) two sided tape. Really happy with the look....
B001UFXTG6|5|Did a lot of research on this and similar products.  I came across a review similar to my situation and figured for the price i would give them a try.  Needless to say by the 5 star rating I am more than satisfied with the purchase.  Bought a 7000lb dry weight camper to be pulled by my '02 silverado.  The tow home was without the Hellwig springs.  The truck was sagging pretty bad in the rear and very light on the front end even with a distribution hitch.  Installed the Hellwig springs and now the truck sits perfectly level.  I chose the set with the silencers and I don't hear any of the noise other reviews talked about.  My truck is a little more rigid with them on when I'm not towing, but the benefit of having them on far outweighs this minor issue and install is easy enough that I will probably take them off when we're not in camping season.  Great but!!!  Hope this helps.
B00IEJP6TO|5|Very good product. It met my expectations.
B0022XKQ9S|2|According to the numbers stamped on them I got the right ones but the ones pictured look more straight. Mine are more curved making the front hole and the back hole the same distance. No matter how I put them I get a 1 1/2&#34; drop instead of a 1' drop in one hole or a  2&#34; drop in the other. and the center hole raises the bike a 1/2&#34; instead of stock. It sits better for me with them on so I'll leave them on but they are not as described is why only 2 stars.
B003EM7CYS|4|Install took less then 15 minutes and it looks great
B00JDPYXM4|5|Works Fantabulous!!
B008032KNE|5|Worked great exact OEM fit on the car.
B00IAC7ZNU|5|A must have if you always use the phone while driving. You don't have to look down at all. Works well with iPhone 6
B00M7CWS40|5|Perfect
B0009IQZH0|5|Great service/product.
B001B7BUAU|5|using now vg quality

B0037NUC2S|5|Works perfectly
B00QLGEJC2|5|Oh boy, does it pump-<br />Great price, and quick shipping! No complaints here!!
B000XQ9MGE|1|complete garbage.  lasted just under 2 years before it died.
B00F5LN4FM|3|Quality OK but doesn't fit well.
B003P65D1W|5|great looking frame
B00BE5JLAA|5|Great product..
B00BTL8TFW|5|just what we needed
B00W67T6HI|5|good purchase
B0007UQ2N2|5|super fast shipment with prime.  Light weight.  Great pressure.  Highly recommend.
B00480BVXS|5|Great insect screen. Camco has great quality products!
B00C567B0Y|5|I bought this to fit a 2000 forester.  I also needed a Walker 31310 Exhaust Gasket for the front end of the catalytic converter and a Walker 31357 Exhaust Gasket for the back end of the catalytic converter.  Since I was installing a new catalytic converter I also replace the front O2 sensor with a Bosch 17018 Oxygen Sensor, and replaced the back O2 sensor with a Bosch 13469 Oxygen Sensor.  It was much easier to reach the front mounting bolt on the back side than the OEM Cat I took off because the heat shield was a little smaller.  The only bad thing I can say is the center hanger bracket did not line up well enough with the hanger on my car to get the bolt through the hole but at least the two end flanges lined up perfectly.  My check engine light went out on its own in about 50 miles and passed smog.
B004SSAFB4|4|The cover fits, however, it's not as form fitting as I had thought it would be.  Very blousey and does not come down after the cab for the flat part of the pick up bed.  As mentioned, it does fit my 2014 RAM 1500, Crew Cab with 6'4&#34; bed, even with the side mirrors left out in normal mode.  I haven't tried with them in towing mode, but it looks like it would be a tight fit.
B0023VIXNA|5|20 minutes to replace and it looks great!
B001T8J4YK|5|Works great and way better fuel mileage
B000EEU0KM|4|For thr price you can't go wrong, it does everything it says
B00W2OSK7C|5|If you have a Jeep renegade you need these!!!
B000C9WJ8K|4|Good filter at great price. I use this filter as an in line on my fuel line feeding a Mercury 115 hp outboard.
B00NPIN8FI|1|Bulbs lasted less than 5 hours in our Cub Cadet lawn tractor.  Save yourself some money and pass these by.
B002XM59F4|5|Good price worked as expected . We tend to break these in are r v .
B000C5DZWI|5|Perfect fit for a 2007 Ford Focus. It was a quick and easy job to replace.
B00E63THQA|5|keeps ice and water for over 24 hours! love this product.
B000ET525K|5|Great price, does the job. I use it to repair my motorcycle tire, and the plugs hold the life of the tire.
B003ZOIYZ6|5|Product & shipping were perfect, what more can I say.  This was installed on a '89 4k generator in a '89 Fleetwood Southwind motorhome
B000EQ8HGO|5|ditto
B00NGXTGI0|5|Loved it.
B007P73Y2C|5|Great price, very fast delivery
B004HCOE7W|2|The best tire dressing I have ever used
B00T68UHNC|5|These took 5 minutes to install since they do not require removal of the hinge bolts for the hood. They work exceptionally well and I installed them in time for the Woodward Dream Cruise. I ditched the prop rod as soon as I could, but not soon enough because it took me 9 years to finally install hood struts on my 07 GT!<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars, easy installation, top notch quality
B0028CMPIS|5|What can I say? Reasonable price, quick shipping.  Product does what it is made to do...prevent chatter in posi rear.
B0026M9BDC|2|ok these fit my 2000 chevy blazer only had to bend the top prong out.  But thats not why am writing a review its how they are made. the tabs that hold the rubber bumper in are wrong.They need to bend the housing in on three sides to keep the rubber bumper from popping out. I dont think they will last long. if I go down far enough to use them it will pop out on road. I tried to bend the three prongs in some more but I still dont think they will last.I should have bought the oem gm ones for a few dollars more. My stock ones I took off were bent on three sides plus had the tabs bent in to the rubber . My bad I guess live an learn .
B00UZBWHBE|5|Well machined, great price for 10 not just 8. Well nuts are great plus the washers are a nice touch.
B00EDQ3F72|5|Being a collector of Ghostbuster items this is a worth while addition.
B004L5WLZ2|5|Excellent product to use after you freshly wax your car. The difference between the 2 steps are visually noticeable and jaw dropping.
B00R1LP17S|5|I received this product as a replacement for their portable air compressor model G, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QP7YFRQ. I am disappointed at that product because the psi gauge is very inaccurate. Their customer service Bradley then contacted me and sent me this product as compensation. After I tried this one I found it is amazing, I know it is a bit more expensive than other products but it must be the best air compressor/inflator you would've ever used, it is fast, quiet and most importantly the digital PSI gauge is extreme accurate and you can even the PSI of all four tires very easily, only shortage is the compressor is a little heavy (but still portable and you will definitely like it).
B00AC6Z9KS|5|Every thing was perfect
B00GOFD4SU|5|I placed it on the trailer I pull behind my Goldwing to let everyone know I've been there.
B0081RMIK4|5|Arrived on time and in good condition. Was so easy to install, I had it in in less than 5 minutes. It makes a very nice upgrade to my '09 Subaru Forester.
B00MBB9YWG|5|Bought two of these, one for myself and another for my passenger. Installation, pairing and sync were a breeze and for the price, I've not found another motorcycle headset that can compare! Audio quality is pretty good and Bluetooth pairs automatically every time I turn it on. Can't really ask for much more than that! I lost the first one I had bought and didn't really sweat it for $50. If I had lost a $250 Scala or other equivalent unit id have been devastated!
B00C1453SM|5|great!
B003YMX0O4|5|I've done a lot of brake work over the years and was first hesitant about these because of the huge price difference between them and the OEM. The casting and machining look great and the quality of steel used is obviously not your $19.99 special. I am satisfied with the overall quality but....I used the Wagner TQ pads and do believe that I now have a noticeable brake fade. The original pads were obviously semi-metallic and I went with the WTQ ceramic since I've used them many times on other vehicles with great success.
B002JBDH26|5|Good product hard to install look up YouTube for an idea.
B001GN1L8U|5|My truck's trailer hitch actually wired improperly from the factory.  I wanted a tool to correct that and also to check wiring that I may connect to it.
B0051SERD2|5|Works as advertized I like it.
B00G2L95R0|3|First off i bought one for my 2006 corvette.  WOW, are these way over priced... First thing i noticed the day i got it in was, when i drove at night the lighting of this unit is way to bright...Holy Cow, felt like i was driving a Rice Burner Jap Car.... So i contacted the company, and thier dimmer is 35.00 plus ship... If i knew these two isues i would not of bought the OVER PRICED UNIT. Then, i found a Youtube video on this item, and saw thier adjustable  dimmer..So i then went to ebay and see the exact dimmer for 4-8 dollars, So i bought one there that cost me 7 dollars with prioity ship.. So then i looked up the lighting bar that fits this and it ranges from 2-8 dollars and thats for more than one... Also, in my 2006 corvette when driving down high way at say 55, there is some improvment but ,, to pay over 400 for this NOT !! Im sure other model car's you can expect maybe better results, but very little with my 2006 corvette. So if you still going to look at this unit, Its pretty easy to install for most, But if your going to buy any of thier acessory's to add to it like ,light adjuster, and or other color LED'S.. Look on ebay ..i payed 7 dollars and change for the dimmer, and the company wants 35.00.. I
B000M5WTSY|3|This was obviously a return that was then sent to me, but Amazon came through with a full refund.  It had  been used already as evidenced by the teflon tape on the threads and gas smell. I did not have a chance to use the gauge so I can not comment on the functionality, although it looks pretty cheaply produced, but may be usable on a limited basis.
B0079GQKDE|5|It is the little things in life that help you keep your sanity - this is one of them. Stop looking and buy now.
B0002F6692|5|these tire valve stem extenders worked great, were easy to install and are a great value
B002U6ELS4|5|Excellent quality and easy to install. Comes with a high quality gasket. Drain plug and deep pan is a must for me.
B00449NLF4|5|Great product, sent on time
B001UMZ07A|4|Just good as any other no wonder kit or finish.
B005K6AE9G|5|works great
B000NEZ594|5|Very easy to use. OEM product in original packaging shipped directly from a BMW dealer. Very little instruction included but it's pretty self-explanatory. Google it if you're unsure.
B005G3XFW6|5|Hilarious ice breaker! Folks do a double-take when they read this great &#34;permit&#34; sticker. Good quality materials, and a professional look. &#34;Where can I get one?&#34; is the most frequent question asked
B00RD4D9AO|5|Fits perfect on my Nissan Xtrail 2016
B0000BX6Q7|5|Works great on my golf cart windshield without scratching.
B002INUWRS|5|I liked the clamps very much. I use them to hold wood/ metal and it works okay.
B00I7ELZWI|5|Fast shipping.. cheaper and good quality.
B0002ILK4K|5|Perfect fit and works great
B001C6N7M4|5|Fit perfectly on my Silverado truck. It doesn't come with a bulb. Came fast too!!!
B00PT18QAQ|5|I just received the TireTek tire gauge today.  I tried it out to check the pressure in my tires and found it to be very accurate and easy to read. I like the large dial that is easy to read.
B0089KNGNQ|5|I am extremely satisfied with this Toyota FOB key (i.e., Prox. Remote with Smart Functionality). I paired the FOB key with a 2007 Toyota Prius (Touring edition) with &#34;smart key&#34; functionality. The new FOB looks just like the old one and works perfectly.<br /><br />Pairing the FOB to the vehicle (using the so called &#34;chicken dance&#34; process) took about 15 minutes. Now, both the old FOB and the new FOB are fully functional. In other words, both FOBs (1) unlock the car automatically when I approach the vehicle, without me pushing any buttons (2) you can turn the car on and drive it without putting the FOB in the FOB-slot (these first two features are the &#34;smart key&#34; functionality), (3) the unlock and lock buttons work to remotely unlock and lock the car, and (4) you can put the FOB in the FOB-slot and start the car.<br /><br />I am thrilled. The Toyota dealer quoted me a price (allegedly at cost) of $245 for the FOB key itself, with another $100 for programming! Basically, I saved $240! I am thrilled.
B00062ZDBS|5|I've used K&N for years and really like their products
B0022ZI0JY|2|Tried this on some baked on grime and did not like the results. Went over the same area with a steel blade and there was no doubt which worked best. I will try it some more and the only thing is that it may not gouge as sometimes a steel blade will.
B00B4XBQPU|5|perfect product.
B0045L8RQO|5|best deal for the money
B00AQ92OG8|5|Great bulbs,super bright.Had to upgrade my headlights to match them.Very  satisfied with them.A little pricey but worth it.
B004LEO1DI|5|Exactly as described. Very fast shipping and like stock parts that I'm replacing
B00GG9FK2M|5|Lived up the hype, product washes the car and its easier than a regular wash. It also leaves a nice shine afterwards.
B00CO6Q4XK|1|Did not work for me.  The Bushing appear to be about 0.030&#34; shorter than my old coupling.  The bushing should be molded in set of three, one ste high on one side, the other three high on the opposite side.  One I received did not (two high on one side).  In addition the polyurethane does not allow much flex.  All resulting in BAD vibration at idle.  Replaced with OEM style Aluminum & Rubber, no problem, vibration gone.
B004I0HGK0|5|Works great, looks like the original.
B00FBPOXZ2|4|Works well, dries quickly to keep the deck dry underneath. Wish it was a little more heavy duty.  Rough chair legs can make it snag.
B00G7KPPUC|5|Best Exhaust out there!!!!!  I was looking for a good exhaust for my 2015 HD Iron 883 and I was not sure if to get this Vance and Hines or the Screamin Eagle. After a couple months of research and info I decide to go with this one. And I got it in 2 days at my house I just finish installing it and it did not disappoint me at all. It make my bike sound so mean and better response. As soon I crank it on, the deep sound make all the neighbors come out to the balcony of their apartment lol. Went for a ride..... and I am happy with the looks and the sound.
B00407TVNQ|1|Did not match. Not even close.
B00IKJ3DAM|2|I bought these brake pads for my 2008 BMW 328xi, and they work well with little dust and no noise.  However, the brake pads did not fit correctly I had to file off 1/4 inch of material from either side to get them to match up with the originals so they could fit.  If you are considering buying be very cautious they are a good buy but they will most likely require some work for them to fit correctly.
B001O0XMI2|5|My car stops!
B007QVB71C|5|Exactly met expectations
B00O4DX4HU|5|Looks great on my husbands truck.  Does need a chrome bumper behind it to make it stand out.
B0024E6QX0|5|It fits and works
B008RRTC70|5|Very happy with product
B000066OC7|1|This is not a good dense pillow that would help anyone who's over 35 lbs.  It was not worth the money.
B00I59XBEK|3|While I love the look and quality of the sticker, it is not the size I was expecting. In their defense, it does say 8 inches in the item title, but I was looking at the picture, not really paying attention to the size in the title. I will find another place for this, but it definitely can't fit next to my mouse trackpad (even if I had a 15 inch macbook... I have 13.3 retina display macbook pro).
B003SRHNE8|4|Good quality
B002ULHJRY|1|the advertisement was deceiving. i bought one and when i used it IT DOESN'T WORK.
B004W0QISM|4|Replaced rolled towel. Wish they were 1/2 again bigger but still were comfortable on a recent trip.
B002PL5818|4|please
B0087LM00W|5|Cool looking and nice quality cap. Now I can drive my SL500 Roadster in style, lol!
B000GV72IG|4|The studs wasn't long enough for the whole lugnut to cover all the threads.
B00YOZ4BXE|5|These brackets have a beautiful crinkle finish black paint that looks like it was baked on. They arrived unblemished because they were well protected in the box. They screwed in perfectly into the factory holes, with no modifications needed. I couldn't figure out how to run the wires without it looking like a nightmare. Finally I realized that the outer curve of the bracket (that wraps around the A pillar) is actually two angles; it's not a perfect curve like the car, and in the crevice of the outermost angle, you can fit two wires, but only if you take the insulation off the outside of the two wires. I don't mean run bare wires. What I mean is that the black rubber outer sleeve has to be taken off and just the red and the black insulated wires run in the corner of the bracket. What I had to do was actually cut an eighth-inch slice or channel through the foam padding that was supplied to go between the bottom half of the bracket and the car. So I cut the channel and ran the wires in the corner there, then did a hard left turn and went between the quarter panel and the A pillar beneath the hinge, and down into the wiper sill, then into the engine compartment. Friend of mine who is an accomplished customizer of cars remarked that &#34;it looks factory.&#34;  Indeed. Five stars, even though it cost as much as the light bar<br /><br />And by the way, the light I put on the Jeep was a 50 inch light bar and these brackets fit perfectly. I got the impression that they could be easily modified for 52 inch light. The only stone I can throw at these brackets is that I had to go and buy stainless steel bolts, because I didn't want any rust happening. But that was my choice.
B007TY5EMY|4|Not yet installed, but looks good, and what I ordered.
B00E9QTE2G|5|Great socks for riding.  Great price.
B001G72VIK|4|I installed these on my 1991 Toyota 4Runner and noticed the immediate difference from the oem sealed beams. Installation was easy and straight forward.  I installed Hella 100 watt bulbs and upgraded wiring harness with relay bypass to make sure the bulbs had all the power they needed and to avoid frying the factory light switch. So far I'm very pleased with the improvement.  The Hellas give a intense bright white crystal clear beam of light that equals an HID.
B000F5ECUY|3|I did the head on a 2004 chevy aveo. It did not work well the way shown in the directions. I ended up dismantling, and reassembling the valve adapters on the ends of the threaded rod by itself.  By putting my weight on one of the valve adapters I was able to compress the springs with the adapter on the other end, and keep my eye on the keepers. It still was not easy, and it took a long time to do 16 valves, but it worked. I saw the tool demonstrated on you tube, and they made it look so easy using it the conventional way. But the conventional way did not work for me on this head. Perhaps it works better on a larger head. Mine is only a 1.6L DOHC four cylinder head. The only part of the tool that I really needed was the valve adapters and the threaded rod.
B006QGD996|4|The tie down was used for moving and it worked exactly as I hoped!
B000BARFCK|5|great
B001LHVOVK|4|Nothing earthshattering here: The reader works as described, displays the numbers of the DTCs, and resets them. The two-button interface is awkward, but it does work. For the price, it is a fine thing for my son to keep in his glove compartment in case he has a problem and needs to tell me the code number.
B00BMN30HY|4|I used this relay/harness kit to run Hella 100 watt bulbs. The ceramic harness and cables are OK quality. It included a fused line for direct battery connection.  I installed them on my 1991 Toyota 4Runner and the length fit great. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the relays as one of them started to give me trouble immediately after installation.  I upgraded relays to Bosch to avoid future issues.  Consider purchasing quality relays if you choose this harness.
B000M6UR82|5|very please
B005G2RY6U|3|U bolts are not long enough to use with the pipe saddles.  I use the kit without the saddles. Wish the U bolts were longer.  Couldn't find long enough U bolts in town to use with saddles.
B00BG255Q0|1|This is not the standard automotive decal, but deceptively tiny junky sticker
B001FG40X6|5|Perfect replacement hose.
B006PIWH02|3|Not thrilled that it was not transparent but still like it
B00K2SLS7O|5|Fits like a gove as you would expect from an OEM product.  And takes about 10 minutes to install. Excellent!
B004VR08E6|5|Holy cow! For the price of these nerf bars, I am extremely impressed. I have a 2015 Silverado crew cab and they fit PERFECTLY! The first two brackets attached seamlessly to the pre-threaded holes under the front door. The second two were simple to install by only having to remove two plastic hole plugs on each side of the truck and using the included threaded clips.<br /><br />To the dude with the photos of screwdrivers and a drill in your driveway, you're doing it WRONG!<br /><br />This installation took nothing more than a 13mm socket wrench with a 3&#34; extender bar. Period. Unlike the other reviewer who said you should have some mechanical know-how, HOGWASH!<br /><br />These are so easy to install, a fifth-grader could do it. If you're having a hard time with them, perhaps you should repeat the 5th grade.
B00EZZVI7U|4|Replaced a 30 watt 18&#34; fluorescent F15T8 2-light fixture. The camper has two 30 watt matching fixtures and I replaced one because it was no longer working. This 6.72 watt 12&#34; fixture is twice as bright. The old fixture, 2011 Lance camper, is made of steel, heavy, with an enamel finish. This LED light is plastic. The back of the LED light doesn't have a wire channel. The hole in the ceiling did not align with where I wanted to center the light. Removed the back cover of the light and was able to fish the LED light wire through a different location in the case that better aligned with the hole in the ceiling. Used the four screws that came with the light, it fit flush against the ceiling, and I positioned the light to cover the old four screw holes from the old fixture. When my wife sees this LED light she will ask me to replace the other light fixture I'm sure of it. The cost will be twice as much but I'm going to go with either the 18&#34; LED tube replacements or the new Cabin Bright light so I can keep the other fixture.
B008G23BPA|5|excellent
B004SWWUHW|1|Lights were not sealed and water got into lights. They still work but I did have problems with them already and it's only been a week.  I'm expecting these lights to short out very soon.
B00027GSG6|1|ROTTEN
B00HQRUXMA|1|it says black chrome but there's really nothing black about it maybe a very tiny shade of black but not noticeable at all picture on Amazon is very deceiving
B006NZTZLQ|5|Works great. doesnt link to my samsung galaxy with 3g. Have no problems with 4g devices, so works fine.
B00NWXQLZA|5|Love these spacers. had to cut out some areas to fit my specific speakers as it remotes out the leads from the amp/stereo. Nothing a dremel couldn't handle and it was very easy. Screws drill right through without hassle which is always appreciated too. Plastic is very forgiving as well.
B00AOAA5A6|1|What ever you do, don't get excited about this item like we did. Certainly don't buy it as a gift like I did and brag before it arrives. I paid 20% more for this item and waited longer to receive it than the other competitor (Husky). Only to get it and find out it is a third of an order. No front seat, no 2nd seat. Are you kidding me?!?!
B00BFE67WA|5|Exactly what Needed!! Oil pressure back to normal .
B009IJQ5OY|5|Had the 25' hose for 11 years and used it camping regularly.  VERY durable.  When it finally wore out, I bought TWO more.  Yes, it needs to be kink-free.  Yes, it needs to be completely unrolled to use.  But it is very convenient, flexible, and space saving.  I can't address how it performs in yard applications or marine uses, but I find it a great product and good value!  Highly recommend!
B00DFMFYCO|5|Great product
B00GTQ9BN6|1|Bolted up right but as far as the throttle cable hook up and the throttle components no good and the spring for the throttle is to stiff causing thumb fatigue
B00LP80N5I|5|Excellent!
B0007TQWKQ|4|Works to patch problem areas well but couldnt get to match 100%, pretty close though.
B001GG09GW|4|larger than I thought it was going to be.  I bought it for my husband's car which we call the &#34;Storm Trooper&#34;
B005ETWZMI|2|The gasket comes broke,Ivhope get one replace.
B00WTKKPZY|5|Perfect fitting, strong, quick installation and nice. I love it!
B007AORB6U|5|Perfect fit.  Thanks
B00275JKCK|5|It was a gift and all my expectations were met by Amazon.com.
B000BR1Q6Y|5|So far so good! Great fit, easy to install and boosted power as advertised!
B00UFXZT12|5|Very nice really like it

B00LIXZHSI|5|bright as hell
B00MPJ3X6W|5|thank you A+++++++++
B00KWDGIKG|5|Fits a Cyberpower 425VA ups perfectly.
B00CQAR1C2|5|We are very pleased with our awning.  It was also delivered ahead of the promised date.  It seems to be of good quality and looks fine.  Thank you.
B00VAFARZC|2|This states that it fits a 2013 VW Touareg but it does not!!
B00FX6N7DI|5|It seems to work fine. I haven't seen any side effects to it. I added this to my Audi A6.
B00LGKN5AA|1|Did not fit on my car,,waste of time and money
B004UTD0RW|5|delivered as promised, was what I expected
B00DBERBVI|1|too big
B00032K4FG|3|Cheap.. Black from broke first week
B00K80L7TA|5|This works on my BMW and every other car ive tried. I love this thing, i can pin point any problems and get it solved
B00M9XB67M|5|After hearing a loud &#34;snap&#34; the other day and having the driver's window fall completely down into the door of our Jeep Liberty, I ordered this part (I just can't handle another entire day of sitting at the Jeep dealership and forking over $300++ to get this fixed). With the help of a YouTube video  (search &#34;how i can fix window regulator liberty 2002-2003-2004-2005-2006-2007 front left right ,back LH,RH&#34;),  I had this fixed in less than an hour.<br />The last clip lasted 10 years, so I'm hopeful for 5 years (at least) with this part. Exactly like the OEM part and a good price.
B001XTQKSS|1|I bought this product because the description said it fit an E60 chassis BMW & would mount to easily to factory holes, UNTRUE!!.  it comes with tapping screws, not the required [[ASIN:B001XTQKSS 2004-2010 BMW 5 Series E60 Duraflex M5 Look Side Skirts Rocker Panels - 2 Piece]] screws or the required clips to mount.  It claims to be a stronger material, not true!  It claims to look like the E60 BMW M5 side skirt, not true, just resembles, but looks fake!  I'm not positive where is came from, but it appears China or somewhere outside the USA, but claims it comes from California Even with a professional installed as suggested, it doesn't even come close to fitting like a factory side skirt!!!!  It has a 4 inch Gap from the factory piece, which is embarrising!! ( See Photos) The professional installer wanted to know where I got this garbage from & at first refused to install this junk & also had to use mounting tape to get it to hold, the OEM did not!  So I paid $181 for trash, when I could have gotten the official OEM BMW part from the dealer, either E60 chassis normal or M5 for $210 + 22 Shipping, so $232.  I decided to save a few dollars, since the description seemed legit.  DO NOT NOT BUY THIS PART, IT IS JUNK & WASTE OF MONEY!!!.  I am now out almost $300 + time for nothing!!
B0064T4VTW|5|Works great fast shipping
B00QRHDIPY|4|Doing  fine.  Will keep battery topped up.
B0040CYWX0|5|Just as described.
B002WI0EJK|3|I want it to be more bright.
B0022XS3F2|5|Heavy duty.  These are beautiful examples of mirrors.  They are even more aggresive and clean than I expected.  I will be buying kuryakyn again.  I have a large wishlist already.  These guys do not f£¥k around.  Even the packaging was protective and thoughtful.
B00CEX599S|4|The corner windows on this car are useless anyway, definitely improve the appearance.  Noone ever rides in the useless rear seat.
B00K1N43R2|4|First of all let me get something off my chest...I have read numerous reviews of this product mentioning poor airflow. The fan DOES NOT BLOW AIR - IT SUCKS COOL CONDITIONED AIR THROUGH THE CUSHION AND DISCHARGES IT UNDER THE SEAT!<br /><br />We live in south Texas and summers are brutally hot. I purchased a refurb and it looks new and works well. Was excited to install this in my wife's jeep. I watched the video and it looked pretty easy. Unfortunately the 2012 Jeep Liberty has a metal bar between the seat cushion and back. I literally had to use a pry bar to make enough room to get the box and tubes through the seat. I thought for sure the metal bar would crush the distribution box and not allow any airflow. But it's a sturdy box and has held up.<br />The rest of the install was really easy. I routed the power cord under the carpet and behind the center console over to the outlet. I taped the control panel to a nice spot on the center console.<br />As for the function my wife loves it. I have driven the jeep a few times and it works great. I am 6'5&#34; and thought it might not work well for me but it is great. It cools unbelievably well even on setting 2 or 3. It's really nice getting out of the vehicle without a wet sweaty back!<br />I am definitely purchasing one of these for my Acura. Fit and finish are great - I would definitely recommend this but check your cars seat first. If you can slide your fingers through the opening fairly easily them it should install without any problems.
B00UO6HP9Y|5|I bought this for my mom, who has a Pleasureway Excel (E350 based Class B RV). This wasn't a direct fit for the outdoor light that was already on the RV, but it was pretty darn close. My brother installed it, and I helped tweak the sensitivity while we were out on a 2.5 week trip this past summer. Mom loves it because the light is much brighter and &#34;clearer&#34; than the original light she had, plus the motion detector works great. It's very easy to turn on (flip the switch on/off/on, and you'll see a blue light indicating the motion detector is set, then the blue light goes out).
B002T4J7SQ|5|MORE POWER !!
B00993C55W|5|Good
B000FLLWGA|5|Works great, I think (Its never gone off yet,) Very easy install.
B00NN2R74E|5|Thanks for the product
B00LLNWT36|3|I have returned it. I made a mistake ordering others plates
B000RFUF12|5|This worked great for filling my RV batteries.  They are tucked into a forward compartment and this makes it easy to refill.
B004ZO3VN0|5|This is the only Octane Booster I have ever used that has performed as advertised.  I need to run 95 octane in my VRod Harley-Davidson and pump gas in CA is 91.  Straight pump gas can leave it sputtering especially when 1st started.  8oz of torco per tank as indicated by the instructions left the bike running as if it had been completely gone through - wonderful startup, immediate power/throttle response and better roll-on power.  I bought a Stainless Steel measuring cup with indented markings up to 16 oz.  Any printed markings or a plastic cup will most likely dissolve.  If you have a higher compression vehicle, upwards of say 9.75:1 and you don't want to have to mess around with racing fuel or trying to get aviation fuel that will be safe; I highly recommend this product.  As I said I add 8 oz at the pump and then fill it up with 5 gal of super unleaded (91). The outcome is 95 octane fuel that makes my motorcycle very happy and it is safe for the O2 sensor.
B00L7E80IW|4|These tissues are not as good as the real tempo tissues were, but they fit the holder and I will continue to buy them.
B00ARJQAA8|4|Part fit perfectly and works fine. A little longer shipping time than I'd hoped.
B00HUBXBBM|4|The wedge seems to be a little bit stiffer than I wanted, however,  in time with use it will probably be just fine.  The width is good.
B000ARTZPO|3|Haven't noticed a difference yet ! Only 200 miles.
B00I36K1VQ|5|The unit was well made and works well.
B002C7DSIK|3|Could be a little more stronger to hold back  heavier items.
B00KTIZ2C4|4|These are very nice and work really well. I got red to match the car and they do a great job. Fair price!
B00LM55POS|5|great deal on these
B00YDDT9IO|4|Very good quality,fits good,looks grate,the only problem it is bent a little in the middle
B0002UHVAA|5|Works great! This sounds awful but it is very helpful to see the color of the water as you clean the tank to really see that it's cleaned out! Rev owners will totally get what I'm saying lol
B00KTIAREM|5|I was without the keyless remote for five years. I thought this was a dealer fix for big money. Then a friend told me about these. It took me five minutes to program the remotes. Very easy and the price is great. The wife loves them too.
B00I548REE|5|Fit perfect, went on easy, look good
B000HYOUSC|5|Just what I needed
B00DJBQ1SW|5|Works well so far. It has saved me a lot of back ache..<br />Thank you:)
B00QMWQQBW|4|Cheap but works fine
B000FCEXQ0|5|Perfect fit for my 09 si sedan. With vent visors cracked an inch, the sunshade lowers the in car temperature by an average of 30°. This product is made extremely well and I would highly recommend it!
B003U4O414|5|Add this to my 2011 Tundra with the notoriously noisy 5.7 V8. This engine makes a diesel clattering noise due to the piston slap. This product shuts it right the hell up.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Works great in the Texas heat. Also  easy to use. Quality material. The jumbo fits great in a Hyundai a Sonata
B00D1CQVIY|5|Solid switch.
B003ZJNZB4|5|Nice hat and shipped quickly. Just a bit small for an adult head.

B0009NUG66|4|Stayed dry in a rainstorm!

B000BFR6TM|5|High quality ,  perfect fit and easy install. Made old new again. Awesome.
B002UCACPO|5|Useful and good product.

B002NG90DC|5|The PaintGage FNF-A worked extremely well for determining the coating thickness of barrier coats for a steel hull.  The gauge was easy to calibrate and use, provided dry coating thickness measurements in just seconds.

B00VJXXU9K|3|Strong Lil dudes but don't hold up to the weather well
B00030BFQA|5|Lifesaver.

B009S4SZ3S|5|Great tool.....Made it possible to remove the stuck caliper pistons after several had said it was hopeless & caliper replacement would necessary.
B000RNU43I|4|Packaging is totally lazy and ineffective. Box was nearly destroyed, paint/coating was chipped up on the hitch.  Was not twisted like some other reviews.<br /><br />Hitch installed very easily in under 30 minutes by myself.  I used to jackstands to hold it relatively close to where it needed to be and then lifted it in place.  The hardest part was starting the first bolt with one hand and holding that side of the hitch up while supporting the other side with my other hand.  Problem Inhad could be fixed with some taller jackstands or an extra set of hands.  I installed the universal Reese hitch on my last truck and it took over three hours to install.  I wish I had just purchased one that was made specifically for my vehicle like this.  Looks good and fits very well.
B00XZ70V5O|4|Decent product, $60 less than OEM.
B00GQBFSI6|5|Easy to install, and adds to over all look of doors!!!
B00DDYT7Y0|4|first superfast shipping, well built solid little light bar very bright. I installed in my 2005 ford f-150<br />second these need to have a longer cable to help with install<br />third these need a plug inline to make install easier the control box makes it difficult to install<br />fourth the blue lights are not as dark a blue as in the picture<br />overall I give them a 9.5 out of ten. excellent lights for a great price
B00D4B04XA|1|Piece of crap lasted long enough for warranty to end do not buy a complete ripoff
B009DJUVNU|1|the material is to thin waste of money
B0043DOY8O|1|These are NOT 6&#34; exhaust clamps. They are more like 7&#34;.  They are so cheap they just fold up when you go tighten them.  I had to weld braces on them to stiffen them up enough to use, I was in a pinch and needed to use them.  Otherwise I would have returned them.  Learn from my mistake.
B00T7DR7FW|5|Work as intended
B00EFFWYRI|3|not bad will see how well it holds up
B006N953H2|5|So far so good.  It fit perfectly on my 2003 Honda Odyssey EXL and so far after about 200 city miles of driving it's working fine.
B00JJ3R8RC|5|Arrived in timely manner--Great Quality
B002935IV2|1|Serves no purpose..rolled under bag while driving
B007WMUL44|1|First time I started it the relay went into a loop and wouldn't kick off the starter. Now the wires are burnt up and I have to jump the terminals to start the 4wheeler.

B0050IS7HK|2|very small sized. padding rough in places and binding in others. had try remove cheek pads to wear for any length of time. not a bad price but you definitely get what you pay for.
B00DOZY586|4|This is a nice tool. But if in the hvac business it makes you lazy with your math.

B00ZKQ8BJQ|5|Works great and very convenient.
B00FS3CB6A|5|Light and easy to use.
B00LSTGV6Y|1|I but this pan because it description said its designed would fit my year xj.  The drivers side of the pan is in conflict with the exhaust y pipe for anyone who has a 2000 or 2001.  I had little time so was left with little option and was forced to modify it myself.  If you have a 200 or 2001 save your money, and make your own or buy a custom one.
B0002SA492|5|Works as advertised and doesn't leak.
B001FHQQJG|5|So far so good. Installed this 5 months ago and it hasn't given me any problems yet. It does look different from the OEM that my Charger had but I can tell you that it fits perfectly for a 2008 Dodge Charger.
B00WQ32YC6|5|This is the first time I've seen my old unit patch and had to get this patch.  It is a vinyl patch...was a little big.  I would have preferred it slightly smaller.  But nice overall.  Product came quick enough.  Would purchase from seller again.
B003UT3S6Q|5|Used it today. Does a good job no rubbing .
B00N3LJIK6|5|I like to very much
B007HROBOU|2|Should be longer.
B00LXJTUM6|5|Love it!!!
B00LIXZHSI|5|Hood quality for the price. Well made metal outside housing. Come with bolts and L wrench tools for both the lights to attach on the bumper and to take off cover to replace bulb.
B00JALACGM|1|Idem did not note it was hid low beam and halogen high beam. Low beam is like high beam.. as far as had to adjust light all the way down to keep from getting high beamed from on-coming drivers... and with adjusted all the way down, it sucks!! I would not recommend.
B007FR3JVI|5|Perfect! Fixed the problem immediately!
B00495UQT2|4|Works ok. Don 't forget to drain water out before winter.
B00GSAUHB8|5|perfect fit in my Lexus
B00TKJX7NE|5|After much research, I decided to go with the ClipperCreek charging station. I chose the plug in version so I could take it with me when moving. This has been a reliable charging station. I like the basic, straight-forward, no-frills design.  And I especially like the price point in comparison to other charging stations. If you are looking for techy and gadgety, you'll want another version, which ClipperCreek does offer. But I feel the &#34;extra&#34; tech features you can get in a charging station are already built into most electric cars, making them somewhat redundant, so why pay extra for them? If you are looking for durable, easy to use, no-fail, and quick installation, this is for you. It literally took less than 10 minutes to hang on the garage wall and plug in. Zero learning curve. As a bonus, it seems to charge my car (Nissan Leaf) faster than the public level 2 chargers I have been using.
B0066CP998|3|Only fair
B00C7LOESO|5|You can't never go wrong with German quality! H&R rocks! ;)

B008G46DVW|5|A 20 year old Echo trimmer needed help. The ignition coil and a new carburetor made it new again!
B00HHH15MG|1|Just the glass part with no connector, for someone not knowing what there doing, don't buy this! Just wrong that shows it in the picture but not really there, total mistake , Do Not Buy.
B0032H6WR8|3|OK for quick and temporary protection from the rain, but not the greatest fit. Older design was much better.
B00OIABGGU|1|Product is great. Seller not so great. First and last time I use this seller. Poor busniess management.
B00M1URMZ8|3|The unit will not stay in passive mode. It arms even if you don't want it to.
B00H1IPAUY|1|Item arrived with egr valve only. No gaskets were included anywhere in the packaging.
B00IWOBGOA|5|Love it.
B000WMS6DY|5|It's a excellent product thanks for perfect service
B001O01CZC|5|Good product...
B0002KKIVE|5|I use Raggtop products to protect my horse drawn carriages. One of them has wool broadcloth upholstery and another one will soon have wool Bedford cord upholstery.  The upholstery on the former is now about four years old.  I spray the upholstery twice a year with Raggtop fabric protectant and have had zero problems with mildew, etc. from our cold, wet winters.  The carriages are not subjected to a lot of harsh UV etc and are kept covered, but simply keeping the mildew of is pretty fantastic.  I like the vinyl protectant for various applications, including upholstery.  The most recent purchase was for a vinyl RV awning.  I just don't bother with other protectants, I really like Raggtop.  One other feature that is important, is that the products contain no silicone, which can be very detrimental to paint (at least makes surfaces very hard to re-paint.)
