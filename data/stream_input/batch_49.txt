B00BVYLBP2|4|Remarkable
B009UX2YAC|5|I love it cause it's fast and is always playing I don't have to worry about it and I recommend this game to everyone.
B003YL4LYI|4|Based on the other reviews I almost didn't read this book. I ended up enjoying it, and the last 500 pages moved quickly. True, nobody really gets to where we as readers want them to, but the setup for book 6 is really interesting. That said, Martin's editor needs to get a bit more aggressive with the delete button and keep inanities such as dragon queen and fearless raider Dany saying one more time &#34;I'm just a young girl and know little...&#34; from creeping into book 6.  I enjoyed this more than book 4, which was a big letdown for me after the intensity of book 3.
B00NEJ7MMI|1|My new favorite CD. Played all through Christmas, now will watch for new music, as they gain popularity.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Awesome<br />Must buy game no lag no scams and very good gameplay
B009EEOQIU|5|Another one of the good movies to see and feel good after you've seen it.
B00EYZMCXK|2|I am very disappointed because when i tried to register the product and activate the tractor pro 2 it was imposible and i can't use it with mi Mac. i am sad to say i expected a better product!
B00AHSIQWE|5|A terrific ending to a phenomenal series.  I loved the first two movies in the series, but I would say that this is the BEST out of the three.  Totally enjoyed it.
B00BD99JMW|5|a sad but just conclusion to a great series would recommend to all who love a good adventure and love story
B008OOYALE|5|fun game, but everything costs a lot, and the prices get worse as you get to higher and higher levels.
B00RGQ4674|5|Outstanding!  So true to the books,  beautifully done,  never a time when you think,  that's not right,  that's not what happened, which is so often the case in productions based on books.  I will watch this as long as it runs and I hope that's a long time!
B009IH0ICG|5|works as planned. Just keep in mind that even the handle gets hot.
B00FCQQ1IW|4|Fast page turner. I can not wait for the next book. A great novel worthy of being an archer novel
B007BLCGNU|1|Plodding plot, if you can call it a plot. Probably the worst make-up I've ever seen in film. Set's dark, gloomy and foreboding(of what I have yet to glean). Dialog of no useful, insightful content. Looks like Clint Eastwood is in need of a visit by Hoover's Doctor. I think he's running low on vitamins, either that or he's just become obtuse.
B000QFW7UA|5|Bought one for my (adult) son and one for myself -- part of the great memories of my son growing up!
B003G4W49C|5|This book was amazing with heartbreak love and overall strategy this book blew my mind. I cannot wait for the movie
B009ZZDNT6|2|It's good for time but as an alarm it sucks if you put it on for all week it'll do it like one day then refuse it
B005ZOBNOI|5|This was a lovely book- enjoyed it thoroughly. Made an unapproachable topic normalized, relatable, and real. I would recommend it!
B0086700CM|5|Omg they finally got temple run!!!!!!!! I'm soooooooooooooooo happy that I saw this it is amazing I'm really good at this game I have gottin over 3 million
B00CWY76CC|4|Nice puzzle game. The challenges were not to tough but required a little thought. Only ten floors but it was free. I will play any new additions so keep them coming!
B00I2TV3NO|4|Even more emotional depth than the first film, while continuing to heighten the conflicted nature of Kat. I would not recommend this future view as a utopia by any means. There are some terrific guest appearances such as Jeffery Wright and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Stanley Tucci continues to amuse and astound in this role. Entertaining film.
B005UBNL0A|5|I never even had to use this really, i build computers for people and make money off this thing! I dont give a CRAP if people say  intel is better, this is the processor that pays you. Or you can pay intel, its your choice.
B009Y6V7XK|5|As a fan of the older Cradle of Filth releases, I enjoy seeing them go back to their older style.  But this time around, it seems smarter and more mature than earlier releases while keeping the attitude.<br /><br />The more recent releases before this one were still good, but they seemed to be straying too far from their core sound and attitude.  Overall, I really enjoyed this one!
B0095D8ZAA|5|This is a simple game but one you need to concentrate watching the screen with, so not one you can really play while watching TV or something.  It works in airplane mode too so you don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play.  I haven't encountered interruptions to get me to join Facebook that other reviewers have claimed in airplane mode.  I always play apps in airplane mode and recommend everyone else do so to.<br /><br />Basically this is a number of different train themed simple puzzle games that revolve around you linking up different tracks together temporally so various trains (from locomotives to quite a number of carriages) can either cross something like a canyon, or where tracks are horizontal on top of each other to avoid trains crashing into each other while reaching the correct destination track level (station).  There's even an ghosts and skull trains level. It is a fairly simple challenge but if you miss one little thing there will be a crash so it can be challenging as well as addictive. My only complaint you quickly unlock all the levels but there's no reason why this app can't be updated to include more in the future.<br /><br />This is a good fun app to keep the brain active, in between reading Kindle books. The graphics are simple but fun and colourful.  Has fun train whistle sound effects and bearable music both of which you can turn off if you wish.
B0002F7I9Y|5|While \\"Ray\\" didn't include any of the duets he performed, it was after all nearly three hours long...you can just listen to this album instead.<br /><br />What range Ray had as a singer and it shows in his choice of musical partners, from Willie Nelson to Norah Jones (lovely to see that our young performers have musical idols and Ray is at the top of the list, personally and professionally).  Willie would understand Ray's struggle with drugs, Norah his desire to innovate.  And for Johnny Mathis to feel \\"humbled\\" being in the same recording studio with Ray is saying something.<br /><br />The duet with Elton John is marvelous, although it's a fierce contest between them to decide who has the cooler shades!<br /><br />In the movie, people criticized Ray for channelling Nat King Cole at the expense of its own voice.  How interesting that Nat's daughter Natalie characterizes Ray as the flip-side of her father.  I love the album liner notes.<br /><br />Bonnie Raitt is one of the stars in the upcoming \\"Lightning in a Bottle,\\" the one-night film history of R&B, and she proves why when she croons \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\\" with Ray.<br /><br />Speaking of crossing, Ray proved long ago that, like Sinatra and Elvis, he had crossover appeal.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Addictive but sometimes frustrating
B000063DHL|5|Somewhere in time is one of the best albums of the 80's. In describing this album it is that easily said. For those of you who are interested in Iron Maiden, or this album, just buy it. For those who are already fans but don't own the album, SHAME ON YOU! Just kidding, but really this should be in every Maiden/Metal fan's collection. Every song here is great and this is probably their heaviest or \\"thickest\\" sounding album overall, yet they don't lose any of their great harmony or the incredible style that we expect from them, especially at this point in their career. The only new thing here is that there are some synth guitars and they really add to the sound of this album and make songs such as Somewhere in Time and Alexander the great even better in their epic glory. <br /> <br />I believe I have said enough, one could go on and on about this album, so JUST BUY IT!
B00IRISI42|5|Great book
B00AREIAI8|5|Lots of fun. A great app for all ages
0684867621|5|I read all of Stephen King's books, and this book captivated me the way &quot;The Stand&quot; did.  My father used to take us camping in New England when we were kids, so I can really relate to this amazing 9 yr old  girl who loses her way on the Adirondack Trail in Maine, even an adult's  biggest fear. The way he delves into her mind &amp; imagination as she  struggles to survive her ordeal is truely amazing.  This has none of the  gore, but all of the intensity of his other books - a must read!
B00992CF6W|1|automatically uninstalling the game two days. I think I was scammed
B006885LZM|4|Well done and likely realistic.  It follows the marines in the Pacific war quite well.
B00CMYRSQG|5|I've been a fan of ABR since 2005 when I saw them on tour with Demon Hunter and Zao. I wasn't a huge fan of their first album \\"Thrill Seeker,\\" but I knew they had great potential. When their next album, \\"Messengers\\" came out I was completely blown away. I hear a lot of people talking about \\"Constellations\\" being ABR's best album. I disagree. With Rescue and Restore ABR went back to more of the \\"in your face\\" metal from Messengers. To me, that is excited. To me, R&R and fresh and I feel the time and effort they put into the album. I love how they dedicated themselves to being different and unique on this album. Some fans will hate it and others, (like myself) embrace it and love it.
B0000668JM|5|I love the record, all of the records I have ordered have come very well packaged with no damage, they are always on time if not early.
B00TEAVEY8|5|Love it,  like finding the clues but does it ever end and go on to another case?
B006TJXZ30|3|like the app vs other alternatives. use it on my kindle fire. its a bit slow though especially when scrolling through the inbox
B006GECE9Y|4|I just started using this browser on my KF HD 8.9 inch.  It seems a lot faster than the stock Silk browser.  With Silk, I was noticing temporary blurred text when I would scroll up or down on a web page.  I haven't seen this with Dolphin.  I also like the interface better, especially how it arranges bookmarked pages.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good browser for the KF HD.
B00AREIAI8|3|It's an ok game, a bit tedious after a while, but not bad. I would recommend adding more features and maybe a connect between all devices it's on.
B0019IB0II|3|This book definitely shows insight.  Thank you for sharing your experience. Wouldn't it be wonderful if ALL stroke victims had this author's background?
B000S1M9LY|1|I just couldn't slog through this. I love an absurd point of view, but this just didn't engage me for long.
B0094K20FK|3|Unfortunately, this is the original theatrical release, not the full version that was subsequently released on home video.  This is a fine film that is enhanced by scenes that were left on the cutting room floor, and it's a shame that the original theatrical edits have been restored.
B00005JLO2|4|I think it would be a mistake to think of this movie entirely in the context of western imperialism.  It would also be a mistake to view this as a period-piece romance.  Very little in the film is attributed to the \\"romantic\\" side of the relationship between Heath's and Kate's characters.  The film above all is about one young man's struggle to overcome his demons and learns what loyalty, courage and honor truly means.  In his attempt to redeem himself from cowardice, he is taken on a journey of sacrifice, self discovery and test of character.  He has help along the way in the form of a native who proves to be an unlikely yet extremely loyal partner, thus challenging the paradigm of who is friend and foe when survival matters most.  In the end, loyalty trumps all the other themes in this film. As Wes Bentley succinctly puts it at the end of the movie \\"fighting for the man on your left and for the man on your right\\" is what the battles were truly about -- never about upholding the ideals of imperialism, not about Queen and Country, neither for glory.      This is a film worth watching, but do so without any pre-conceived notions based on reviews, summaries and eye-catching trailers.  To grasp the deeper meaning of the film, be prepared to watch with an open mind and conscience.
B00AREIAI8|5|Truly amazing has great fun features and amazing detail. Not to mention the great quality too!!! I will never get bored with this and I would recommend it to any horse lover. :)
B009GX7IRA|5|the character of each player has developed very well. Gibbs is showing a very personal side, becoming more open and sharing his softer side. Mc Gee has developed into a stronger more open person (so-when do we see penny and get to meet &#34;the Admiral&#34;.<br /><br />Tony and Ziva-wow!  Like to see more of Vance. Abbie and Ducky are great just the way they are.
B00R2Z32PQ|1|This movie is the equivalent to drinking orange juice right after brushing your teeth.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Excelente
B00EZTLN62|5|This book was a complete surprise as the key subject was totally unexpected until a fair way into the book. When it came, I was initially unsure about what the author was doing but rapidly it drew me in and made me think about the issues. The topic of human exploitation and misunderstanding of animals is something I have a profound interest in and this book tackles it in a most unusual and fascinating context.  The story was well written, the characters intriguing and the plot unravelled in an enticing manner. I loved this book.
0385333846|5|I have sat here for some time now pondering on what exactly to write, but with so many other reviews, which are excellent, I am left a bit uncreative. Let's just say this is a great book. SL5 was recommended to me in a lit class I took last semester, and I picked it up a few weeks ago and devoured it the next day. It was one of those books that was so original, meaningful, and funny (in a dark humorous way), that I could not put it down. I even left a spaghetti stain on a page because I was reading while eating.<br /><br />Anyway, all these reviews say so much about the book, that all I have to say is I agree with all the other good reviews. This is a great book, and it is hard not to like it. Check it out, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!
B0017KIBAI|5|Works great. Used competitively and takes a real beating. Love it. The length of the wire is great too. Very convenient.
B001EBV0OY|5|An amazing story.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|it was difficult to work out early where this was going, but that made it all the more enjoyable. But are lawyers really so mercenary? May be.
B00BD99JMW|5|I read the reviews and saw people didn't care for this book but I thought it was a great book. it's a sad story but it is worth reading, especially if you read the first two books.
B007REV4YI|5|Special effects section was incredible.  I normally don't spend much time with these, but they were GREAT telling the story of this movie.<br /><br />As far as SKYFALL the video and audio were both excellent!  This is the Best &#34;Bond&#34; ever!!!
B0001ZX0PG|4|It's been interesting to read the reviews from folks around the U.S., and around the world.  I found the movie to be extremely emotionally moving.  Beautifully shot.  Robbins, Penn and Linney put in outstanding performances.  Bacon, Harden and Fishburn are solid as well.  The Oscar nominations and wins were well deserved.  Yes, the ending is not happy.  But how often in life are we able to wrap things up to our liking with a big bow on top?  Not everyone has a struggle-free childhood that leads them down a successful, enlightened path in life.  This movie is about those that don't, and the fall out that can follow them all the way to the grave. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a movie where the characters find redemption in the end, this is not the movie for you.  But if you're looking for a moody, emotionally haunting murder mystery, this is a sure bet. <br /> <br />Having said all this, I think I think I \\"got\\" this movie more than some of the reviewers for two reasons (and why I discounted my 5 star view down to 4 stars): <br />1) I read the book before I saw the movie. <br />2) I lived in the Boston neighborhood where the story is set (and Dennis Lehane grew up). <br /> <br />As is typical with book vs. movie, a book has several hundred pages to tell a story whereas a movie has 2 hours to tell the same tale.  There are subplots in books that just don't get the same treatment in movies.  The subplot of Bacon's character Sean and his estranged wife is an example.  I would've preferred the entire subplot left out of the movie as there just wasn't time to explain it.  Linney's and Harden's family is developed much deeper in the book and goes a LONG way in explaining how they ended up the women they are today.  In the book Linney's character, Annabeth, makes her husband Jimmy (Penn) practically look like a saint.  Also, I noticed several reviewers referring to the ending as \\"Eastwood's ending.\\"  This isn't Eastwood's ending, but Lehane's...all the way down to the Dot Day parade. <br /> <br />And speaking of Dot Day...as one reviewer put it, the gritty Boston neighborhood where the story is set operates by its own code of conduct.  Lehane does a decent job of explaining Dorchester.  But how do you cram hundreds of years of turmultuous history into a subplot of a book, much less a 2 hour movie.  To answer one reviewer, Dorchester explains why Jimmy is a murderer who looks like a priest with an ornate cross tattooed on his back.  When you ask someone raised in Dorchester where in Dorchester they were raised, you're more likely to get a parish name than a geographical name.  You're from St. Mark's or St. Pat's, not from Field's Corner or Adam's Village.  It doesn't matter what went down on Saturday night, you better show your face at church on Sunday morning.  It's this same juxtaposition of values that I believe explains Sean's reaction to Jimmy's actions (something a lot of reviewers had issue with).  Sean, the cop, knows what Jimmy did is wrong.  But Sean, the kid from the neighborhood, knows that locking Jimmy up will only add to the layers of tragedy that have fallen on all of them.  What good would it do?  After losing a mother and a sister, Jimmy's girls would've lost him too, leaving Annabeth to take care of her two step-daughters.  And Davey was already emotionally adrift and DID commit a horrible crime which would've doomed him, regardless.  His wife, Celeste, would've ended up raising their son alone.  And frankly, when Davey got in that car 30 years previous, it doomed a piece of Davey, Sean, Jimmy, Annabeth, Celeste, Katie, the Savages, the Harris's, and everyone else whose lives this story touched.
B00I6JOBTI|5|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows-<br />movie - 5 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />great funny enjoyable movie for adults and kids alike.<br />good video and audio throughout and is a definite must have<br />for your animated collection.<br />recommended.
B0060ZJ7BC|5|it's amazing how the right choices aren't always the most beneficial. Great movie. The A's GM chooses to go against traditional methods of running a baseball team. Pitt's dynamic with his daughter and his trust for Hill's character truly make this an epic movie about knowing what popular belief is yet making the dedicated decision to stick to your core beliefs. 10/10...a deep thought type of movie tapping into the psychology/science/passion of modern American professional baseball.
B003R50FRI|5|This is the story of a young convict who goes over the prison walls in his homeland of Australia and then goes on the run ending up in Bombay India. His sojourn there is so fascinating. I turned the pages of this book faster than I thought possible as I was so enthralled with his story. this is a beautifully written novel with a lot of intellectual grist. I love philosophy and there's a bit enough in this novel to satisfy my heart. I just loved it and would definitely say it is certainly, if not the best book I've ever read, it is right up there with the best! Please give this book a close read; you won't be sorry you did.
B00K2CHW48|3|The movie is what it is but I was hoping for more in the special features.  Worst special feathers ever
B00DZ83IPS|4|Good plot
B005RYF5JA|5|Wonderful, wonderful , wonderful !!!!
B000R7HY0K|1|This movie stunk. I can't understand the \\"oh boy, character development\\" crowd...I'm fine with getting to know characters, if they're not silly and annoying. Just cause Quentin thinks that long monologues about pop culture (and anyone needs to discuss our pop culture for more than a second needs to get out more) are entertaining doesn't make it so.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the pathetic last 1/2 hour of Kill Bill 2, you might enjoy this.
B00005RHGK|2|This is sheer enjoyment if you watch it with your brains in the \\"off\\" position. Even for the horror genre, there are actual plot holes as big as the hole where the Demon beast hide the bodies of its victims!!!!<BR>Other than this, theres no way for you not like the first half of the movie, where we are introduced to the brothers, the beast and a few of its preys. THen things get a little bit out of the hand with the history, bnut the overall result is a very satisfactory horror movie.
B007PTJOV0|5|I love it....great game and good graphics. I would recommend anyone to play it. very good game for all ages:))))
B00CWV9FQA|5|This is from my 7 year old and 4 year old Lego-Loving sons:<br /><br />“It really looked like Legos. There was a lot of action, but not scary” (7 year old)<br /><br />“Cool! I liked it, I liked it, I liked it very much” (4 year old)
B00GINENG0|5|Fun app. A great way to get through a series of downtimes. The only one of those things are looking to get through this process is a great way to go.
0448060191|5|This is a classic we wanted our grand daughter to read. The illustrations are professional and wonderful
B001UV4XHY|1|Ok, i find it stupid and asinine that they only release this product for BR (bleu-raes) and DVD (direct video demand), but NOT for VHS (video home system)!!!!!!!!! year after year i see less and less films available for VHS! this sucks! my collection is completely ruined if i conform and start buying BR or DVDs--the cases are too skinny and look RETARDED next to my good old VHS discs! PLEASE release this one on VHS! i just LOVE Hairy Potter and want it soo bad on home media!
B0058O84G0|5|Wonderful read, historically informative whilst following intriguing life stories from diverse social backgrounds
B00DPM7TIG|4|A wonderful story woven around world war two.The bravery of a blind girl and her struggles.
B00I6IKSZ0|2|I deleted the app and tried to redownload it and it said that I still had the app so now I cant play it
B00EE3FVSU|5|I liked Season 1 very much, glad to hear they might make a Season 2.  I wasn't expecting the end at all.
B003ZHR6RK|5|Great Movie, much better in BluRay would recommend to others. Keeps you interested from start to finish, great cast of characters.
B0019T9FL6|5|I Have been a fan of Jennifers ever since her audition on American Idol.  It is amazing at the success and popularity we have all seen since Idol.  She can ONLY be compared to the greatest singers of all time including Whitney Houston, Patti Labelle and Aretha Franklin.  Most others pale in comparison.<br /><br />This album is a perfect debut for her.  Not only does it show her versatility as a singer but it solidifies her as a force to acknowledge in the music business.  If anyone had a doubt to her ability as a vocalist, need only listen to this album and be blown away!<br /><br />Aside from maybe 2 or 3 songs that could have been omitted, the other songs that are good are really really good.  If This Isn't Love, Invisible, Spotlight, We Gon Fight and Giving Myself to name just a few, are amazing.  This album demonstrates her as the best singer of her generation.<br /><br />This album gets 5 stars for its versatility and amazing vocals by one of the best singers of all time. Congradulations for the Best R&B Album for 2009 Grammys and 3 NAACP Awards aswell!  This is a must buy for R&B and Pop music lovers.
B00EHZUQ1W|5|This is the closest anyone will ever get to being inside Devin's head.  Chaotic, loud, beautiful! If you like any of devin's music, you should definitely check this out.
B004YM6JLO|5|its Vampire Diaries, who doesn't love this?  the price is reasonable, and the added episodes are always nice! Cant wait for season 5 to be on DVD.
B000002N3N|5|It seems like anyone can listen to Enya. I'm a college student, and I constantly hear her sweet vocals coming out of many dorm rooms. This album just proves that she still has it. I can't wait for the next one! :)
B005ZOBNOI|4|MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE OF ALL THE HYPE ON THE MOVIE.  DID ENJOY IT EVEN WITH ALL THE TO DO..
B009XIXVU6|5|Wonderful character development and plot evolution. An awesome novel!!!
B0002HZHXG|3|Its nice but it wont fit MACK dump truck.
B00GINENG0|5|This game is so fun and I really like the piano game.
B001LF347E|5|Fantastic BBC production!!!<br />I was hesitant to watch Merlin. Cannot remember why. After watching from beginning to end, I am obsessed. I bought the show on DVD and iTunes -- and watch it over and over. I love Merthur and am so invested in the story and characters that shine with personality.<br />Colin Morgan and Bradley James are amazing in their roles. I am a fan for life.<br />The rest of the cast were great too, as we're the music, locations & sets, costumes. It's all good. Even the revisioning of the story!
B00ISJSFUW|5|What a wonderfull,witty,funny movie. It takes you on a journey that u will love.
B000UBMZ4S|5|The pricing is awesome and the material included in the package is unbelievable.<br /><br />Thanks to Warner Brothers for putting this together.<br /><br />The movie is great and will have an important place in the history of film.<br /><br />Beyond that, this package gives you all the different cuts of the movie.  The quality of the HD material is great, both audio and video.<br /><br />The interviews and background material are very interesting and insightful.  They provide a great background on how the film was conceived through its release, and all that takes place in between, and how the movie was made. If you are interested in film, acting, or technology, this material is better than what I have found in any other movie.
B003VW54QO|4|I had a chance to meet John Wayne back in the 80's when I had my boat moored in Newport Bay.  As I recall, his house was on the end of Lido Isle and he had that big destroyer that he owned docked there.  I would see him from time to time out in his yard or on the deck of his ship and we would always wave at each other.  The ship was named Wild Goose as I recall.  One day he waved me in and I got to spend a few minutes with him face to face.  It was just like chatting with an old friend.  Something I will never forget.  Rio Bravo - Not his best work but a fun movie.
B000IB0DC6|5|For me it points to the dilemma faced by humans; perhaps it  would have been better not to have been born.
0805062971|4|Ever notice that if you're forced to read something, it bores you?  But if you want to read something, you'll get it done quicker.  Then there's that category where if a book really interests you, you'll finish it in two days and recommend it to your High School Sophomore brother who is failing English and hates to read, but you convince him to read it and actually does and loves it!  That's where Fight Club stands.<br />I've read a lot of reviews about the movie and the book where the critic says \\"this is a story about this guy Jack\\".  No! His name is not Jack!  He is simply the narrator.  Palahniuk decided to leave the narrator nameless to convey the hidden psychological background of the story, hidden beneath the richly textured philosophy that he's trying to bring to light.  In the book, the narrator reads a \\"Reader's Digest\\" magazine where there are 1st person articles written \\"by\\" a person's bodily organs.  In the movie, \\"I am Jack's colon.\\"  In the book, \\"I am Joe's broken heart.\\"  I just wanted to clear up that confusion.<br />Fight Club is the tale of two men who are looking for a way to reach bottom.  Self-destruction.  Only when you lose everything are you free to do anything.  The narrator, works as a car company's recall coordinator.  A times B times C is equal to x.  Tyler Durden, he only works night jobs because of his nature.  He's a projectionist, clipping snipits of porn into family entertainment.  He also works as a waiter.  The guerilla waiter.  Urinating in richest of rich persons' soup.<br />The narrator is plagued by insomnia, where everything in his world is a copy of a copy of a copy, there is no difference between falling asleep and being awake.  He meets up with Tyler Durden and his life is changed.  After the explosion and destruction of his condo and his materialistic world, it's all downhill from here.  But losing what you consider your life, the objects that make you who you are, isn't that bad is it?  Deliver me from Swedish Furniture!  May I never be content!  And so, the narrator meets Tyler Durden.<br />But let's back up.  The narrator goes to support groups for things like testicular cancer, bowel parasites, brain diseases, etc...  Being able to let himself go in these places helps him get rid of his insomnia and sleep at night.  But this world is crashed by a woman.  Marla Singer... Marla. Marla. Marla.  Marla, cigarette smoking, black hair, steals clothes and sells them to earn money, eats dead people's Meals on Wheels, that she accepts saying that they are in bed, the woman that invaded the narrator's peace.  Faker.  Liar.<br />After Marla invades the narrator's world, he and Tyler start new support groups, fight clubs, where people who aren't afraid to lose it all go to beat the hell out of each other.  This is their white ball of healing light.  But that's not all.  Tyler takes Fight Club to a whole new level, giving each member terrorist-style homework assignments that all somehow add to Tyler's master plan... that only he knows.<br />These three characters are brought together in such a fashion that you'll be wondering what will happen next until the end, and of course, like the movie, the big surprise ending.  I will warn you, the movie and the book are VERY different.  The movie doesn't follow the book in chronological order and the endings are extremely different.<br />I will recommend Fight Club to everyone.  Even if you've seen the movie first, the book is definitely worth reading.  After every chapter, your view of society will change.  Maybe you'll want to follow in Tyler's footsteps, but you know it isn't possible.  You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.  You know that everyone is materialistic to an extent, but Fight Club lets you see a world without any materialistic value.  Bring 500 dollars in personal burial money.  Only in death, do we all have names.  Perhaps a fight should be scheduled between Ayn Rand and Chuck Palahniuk.  You ARE unique!  No you aren't.  POW!I want you to hit me as hard as you can.  Fight Club begins.<br />My power animal is also a penguin.  A drunken penguin.  You thought they walked funny when they were sober.  Slide.  Crash. Slide again.!  I want you to hit me as hard as you can.  Fight Club begins.<br />My power animal is also a penguin.  A drunken penguin.  You thought they walked funny when they were sober.  Slide.  Crash. Slide again.

B002SSUQFG|1|I bought this watch through Amazon for about $60-80.  It was at the time offered by Amazon itself.  During the day, after \\"winding it\\" by moving my hand (as I do with my Rolex), I would go about my day working.  However, the watch would stop working periodically; therefore by nightfall, it would be of by tens of minutes (not seconds).  Then at night, the watch would stop working when I would go sleep with it on my wrist - the automatic movement could not wind the watch enough during the day to keep the watch going throughout a night of sleeping, even after several days of wearing it.  I exchanged it for another one and that one had exactly the same problem.  No wonder Amazon stopped selling it.  I have owned/own automatic watches from Seiko, Citizen, Rolex, etc.  None of them would go to sleep two hours after I went to sleep!  It is a nice looking watch and price is good, but don't buy it if you want it to keep time. Buy it as a pet that has mind of its own and goes to sleep when you do!

B0000399WI|5|BESIDES ALL OTHER QUALITIES OF ENTERTAINMENT AND DRAMA THIS MOVIE HAS SOMETHING EXTRA ORDINARY TO TELL ABOUT THE FACTS OF LIFE. IT  IS ABOUT HOPE, IT IS ABOUT DETERMINATION, IT IS ABOUT HUMAN CODITIONING, HOW ONE GETS INSTITUTIONALZED IN JAIL AND HOW EVEN THE FREEDOM AFTER 40/50 YEARS DOES NOT GIVE YOU JOY BUT THE MISERY. &quot;GET BUSY DYING OR GET BUSY LIVING&quot; IS THE THE BEST QUOTE WITH WHICH ONE CAN LOOK FARWARD TO THE LIFE AHEAD.

B0011UJMK2|5|Very chilling tale set in the Soviet Union about the horrors the orphans and others had to endure.  I enjoyed the book.
B0012QVJXS|1|When i was young I probably watched this movie but I don't remember it. Probably because it wasn't any good. It's a shame because it had the potential to be better. The very first six to seven minute scene in the movie makes no sense at all, it has no relevence to the story. If there is relevence it's left out of the movie which is just as bad. Three bad guys on trial, then the destruction of planet krypton, poor writing. I like how the movie starts in Krypton and they're talking about the destruction of the planet and their send off of Superman. After the man and woman find baby superman it goes sixteen years in time for one scene when his father dies. The scene seems planned and unnatural. We know nothing about his father. Then he finds the Kryptonite which doesn't hurt him, goes to alaska throws it in the water and it creates some type of palace. The end of the movie when Superman spins around the earth and magically the bomb doesn't go off. Why would circling the earth do this. Also the original authors got screwed out of any proceeds for this film which is wrong. Just another case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.<br />The special effects were good, but it doesn't mean jack to me if the story's bad. I admit that I haven't read the comic, so maybe if I did i'd understand it better. But i shouldn't have to read the comic to enjoy the movie.
B002MG2ATY|5|Exactly as described.  It is a Christmas gift and I probably won't know much more about it until after Christmas.
B007TKT2SK|1|Got this program as the free ap of the day, but really didn't use it. I wish the Kindle allowed users to access Google play
B003K1EYM6|4|I have used these with my iPad 2 and they are quite handy! Actually, I've only really used the SD card adapter, because both my digital cameras (Canon PowerShot and Canon Vixia) use SD cards, so I just remove those from the cameras and use the Apple SD card adapter instead of connecting the cameras by a USB cord. I did try once to use a USB memory stick with the Apple USB adapter, but it would not work. I really wish Apple would provide that capability. Also, of course video files like AVCHD are not going to download to your ipad because they're not compatible, but I already knew that and was not expecting to be able to do that. But all the photos have downloaded without a hitch, and the low quality videos from my old Canon PowerShot A520 will also download. The design and construction seem durable and well-made, just what I expect from Apple.
B00GY0HJ4K|5|Jelly Splash is so awesome. I have paint monsters on my phone and jelly splash is like the same thing. I say get jelly splash it's fun, creative, and a great way to make time go by. Jelly Splash is on the top of my list! I would get it you would have tons of fun! :) #spectacular
B00181JGI2|5|Full disclosure:  I've never seen The Big Lebowski before.<br /><br />(pause for mocking laughter to subside).<br /><br />I know, I know.  How can any self-respecting thirty-something actually admit to never having watching The Dude.  So, here's the deal.  I've never actually admitted that before.  I always smiled and laughed along whenever people mentioned the movie or quoted from its lines.  I always nodded knowingly whenever anyone referenced The Dude or 'What makes a man'.<br /><br />IFC played this movie the other night and I decided that it was time for me to man up and watch.  See what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />And I did.<br /><br />Now, for anyone who wants a movie with a clearly delineated beginning, middle and end, this is not for you.  Try something with Kate Hudson, preferably under the title 'Rom-Com'.<br /><br />No, this is for someone that just wants to be taken on a joyous, raucous ride with incredible talented performers.  Because that's really what John Goodman, Jeff Bridges and Steve Buscemi are in this movie.  Beyond mere actors reading lines they are performers, performing their roles.<br /><br />This movie makes me want to go bowling.  And I hate bowling.
B000V5Y1SQ|3|Always entertaining but never an unexpected plot.  Star Track are all similar.
B003MC5N28|4|I really love this book. I read this book when I was in the fourth or the third grade and I loved it and I read it again last month, I believe, and it was so good. This book was the book that got me into reading. This book started my whole book addiction. It is a dystopian book about a society that controls everything. They control your job, what you eat, when you sleep, how many children you can have, when you die, so on and so forth. In this society they have this person called The giver who holds all of their memories. He hold the ability to see color to here music to love to understand things that the society cannot. He also has to bear the burden of know what death is and having memories of it. He has the memories of pain of neglect of suffering. But he also has the memories of choice. Its a book about becoming who you were born to be, and defying the system. if you like adventure, dystopian, hope-filled type books you'll love this. I believe that everybody should read this book at least once in there lives.
6304618344|5|Face/Off is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.  Complete with action, drama, comedy, an outstanding cast, and an original storyline this movie will fulfill every moviegoer's needs and more.  John  Woo's brilliant and artistic directing not only gives the film an  unforgettable style; it also adds to the plot of the movie through several  ironic instances.  And of course, the tag team of John Travolta and  Nicholas Cage is unbeatable; both of them truly make their characters come  to life.  This is not your typical action movie, it is a thrill ride  jam-packed with extraordinary filmmaking.  No one should miss this movie.
B00N6PCXME|5|Just a note to the publishers, and/or Amazon, it's unfortunate there isn't a whispersync voice, or audio companion to this book (whatever the current term is). There is an audible version, but it's not synced with the book. It's a marvelous technology, and has changed the way I consume fiction. I rarely purchase a novel without it any more.
B0091Q3254|5|Awesome DVD. Great concert at O2 plus bonus features, video trilogy and the acoustic show in Toronto. A must have for a Noel Gallagher fan.
1608191664|1|I started reading this book hoping I'll find some challenging facts and conclusions. None was found.  The way how author tried to prove his point of view are exceptionally shallow and erroneous. I tried not to pay attention to some flaws at the beginning, but further I read, more hard it become.  For example, author states that low inflation is good for economy and should be used as a tool to leverage growth. How is he tries to prove it? - by stating that Brazil and Korea had high growth rates at that moment - but without comparing them to other countries. He just stated - they had high inflation and hight growth rate - i.e. high inflation leads to high growth rate. Could it be true? - I think our world and economy is more complex and many factors should be taken into account, as well as these countries' economies should be compared to other similar ones that has quite close factors but lack of inflation.  Another example of author playing with factual base is about protectionism - he says that since US employed protectionists policies in previous centuries it is beneficial to employ them now and that free trade is bad since so many smart man in the past supported protectionism (quite questionable arguments and author isn't coming to conclusion by employing better arguments).  Or one more: he compares the US to China and India by stating that they achieve higher than US growth rate recently only because they do not employ free markets, forgetting that in both of these countries substantial growth began only when they liberated legislation (i.e. moved towards free markets). He also forgets or hides that grows in China and India highly were achieved because of cheap labor that leads to cheaper goods.  And there is much more and more examples of how author plays with the facts in the book. To conclude, author tries to prove his point of view by employing questionable arguments, that have nothing in common with scientific method and by doing so distort facts.  By the way, you won't find anything about capitalism about this book except continuing grumbling that it's bad and doesn't work.
B00AHSF4AQ|5|My son loves this movie.
B0007O38F8|5|Some of these people really amaze me with their overly critical reviews of the 50 cent album. As if any of you could do a better job, as if any of you could sell 11 million with a debut album. NO Y'ALL CAN'T. So if the album doesn't do anything for you, that's fine. But please stop acting like the Siskel and Eabert of the music world, because quite frankly, y'all are overanalyzing. I think its a fun album, 50 is fun period. It's something anyone who liked the 1st album would like listening to (excluding those who have the need to feel important by overanalyzing).
B00499NHLC|4|Cumberbatch is wonderfully neurotic.  Direction is quick paced, dialogue is snappy.  I look forward to watching the rest of the series.
0470876417|5|I bought this book to read in spare time. Very nice and innovative book layout. Good model layout (Canvas) that allows you to put your business Canvas in similar format then analyse it OR build you new business model inlights of the Business Canvas.
B009JZSC9S|5|Hands down the best courtroom drama on TV. This shows storyline get better and better. I wish I worked @LockhartGardener minus David Lee.....
B00000J7J4|5|This is one of SANTANA'S best CD's. You can tell why it was a GRAMMY winner. They distinctive style shines at its best. For the SANTANA fan or for those who want to become one. I highly recommend this CD!
B004TI5N38|5|Author has come up with a new character. CID Warrant Officer with an interesting family background. Well paced action packed thriller. Baldacci keeps churning them out with varying degrees of quality. This one is one of his better efforts. Expect to see more of this protagonist, and I'll be a buyer.
0439023521|5|I don't remember when is the last time I actually picked up a book marketed as a young adult book, so I had a lot of reservations about reading this one.  I ended up being very glad that I started this on Saturday night because I could barely put it down!  I finished it within 24 hours and the only reason it took me that long is because I had to meet some friends for dinner on Sunday.  I almost did not go because I was so loath to put the book down.<br /><br />Some time in the future, the North American region has been divided into 12 districts, with all districts being ruled by a central government housed in a city simply named The Capitol.  Life is hard in the districts, with people starving and having access to the bare minimum of technology that we have now.  But the lack of material comfort is nothing compared to what the residents of the each district go through each each during the annual Hunger Games, a gladiator type of reality show that pits their children against each other.  Because, you see, once upon a time, about 80 years ago, the districts banded together to try to overthrow the Capitol.  Since then, as punishment and a reminder to the districts that the Capitol holds their lives in its hands, each year, each district is required to send 2 of their children between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the Hunger Game, where the 24 contestants will be dropped into an over-sized arena and fight each other to the death until there is only 1 left standing.  The 1 left standing at the end can then go home to his or her district with all the favor and money the Capitol will see fit to bestow upon him or her.<br /><br />Sounds brutal?  It definitely is.  But for a book in which the majority of the pages are devoted to describing a games where teenagers do their best to kill each other, the author manages the incredible feat of not making the violence over-the-top or gratuitous.  What happens in that arena -  as these kids battle the elements and each other to stay alive - is interesting enough to keep the readers turning the pages.  But there is also a message here - that it is possible to retain one's humanity and common decency under the most trying of circumstances.  This is demonstrated by not only Katniss and Peeta, our 2 protagonists and the contestants from District 12, but some of the minor characters as well.  It is these glimmers of common decency that we get to witness during the in some of these characters that provide the proceedings with some much needed lightness of moments of triumph. Otherwise, the Hunger Games would have been too grim and bleak for the common reader to bear.<br /><br />In Katniss and Peeta, the author has created 2 memorable characters that are the perfect foil for each other.  Katniss, a 16-year-old coal miner's daughter who lost her father at the age of 11 and who has been the sole provider of her family since then, is definitely the more practical and calculating of the duo.  Having volunteered to join the game after her 12-year-old sister's name was called during the drawing in which the contestant's names were announced, her entire focus was on trying to survive the game so she can go back to her family.  Peeta, on the other hand, having been raised as one of the more privileged children in District 12, is more idealistic.  While survival is important to him as well, his refusal to let the Capital turn him into a monster killing machines makes him a more likable character than Katniss and the person that keeps Katniss grounded during the game.  Watching Katniss and Peeta form a tentative alliance in the man-made jungle, and seeing Katniss go from being distrustful of Peeta's every move to being willing to risk her life for him is one of the more satisfying aspects of the book.  And with all the character building and the world building that is going on, the author still manages to put in a jab at the reality-TV culture, where so-called \\"celebrities\\" are made overnight and judged not on their merits or talents but on how well they are able to manufacture a \\"personality\\" for themselves in front of the cameras.  It takes some major talent to be able to create a cast of  memorable characters, a fast-paced and interesting storyline, and so much food-for-thought within the confines of a 288 page novel.<br /><br />This is one of those rare books that will stay with you even hours after you have closed the pages.  And I highly recommend it for anyone who craves adventure along with a dose of romance in their books.  Just make sure that you have lots of time on your hand before you sit down to read it.

B000N6TYLW|3|This Gilmore Girls - The Complete Seventh Season, DVD Box set was sold at a great price. The only problems were it came in a Cardboard Box, not a Plastic Hard Case, and when you play it on Australian TV's, it had a small light, feignt diagonal lines, streaming across the screen. I think this was someing to do with PAL and NTFC TV Standards from Australia and the US.    Anyway, It made my wife happy, because she does not notice those things, and my wallet was happy too. Generally the series is quite funny and entertaining.    Amazon Customer.
B000OVLBEO|5|This movie was absolutely hilarious, and worth seeing if you need a laugh. I saw this in theatres with a group of friends, and our sides were hurting from how much this show made us laugh. I was only hoping we didn't offend any of the hard core fans who were watching the movie too. It was a very funny show, but had it not been funny, then I would have given it 1 star.
B00000BKDW|5|This is an awesome album, and IMHO their best. From the opening speedy riffage of Aces High to the amazingly great fantastic couldn't be better if you tried masterpiece of a closer Rime of the Ancient Mariner, this CD  rocks hard. The traditional Maiden gallop is back at full throttle, Steve's  bass lines are as crazy and prominent as ever, Nicko's drums are truly  insane, and of course, the fantastic vocals of the Air Raid Siren (Bruce  Dickinson for the uninitiated) are just as...whatever they usually are.  People who say metal is dead and that Nirvana (I'm trying to be general,  but Nirvana? ) is the best are obviously not looking at the musical scope  today. Metal is alive and well and Maiden is releasing a new CD in May or  June, and Nirvana and the rest of the grunge scene are... well I'm sure you  all know about THAT little trend. Anyway, just the fact that Maiden can  consistently sell their back catalog shows the growth of their fan base  even today. Look at how many people came online in the year 2000 to review  an album released in 1984. If that doesn't show the longevity of metal  music and its refusal to die, I don't know what does. This is a great album  and deserves to be called a classic. Any CD collection without Powerslave  is probably that of a Ricky Martin fan. If you don't have it, go buy it,  you won't be disappointed (unless you're a Ricky Martin fan, in which case  I could care less if you are disappointed).
B00GH4R95C|5|We enjoyed watching it with our family.<br />I think it was better than passed Superman movies.<br />This is one we would watch again.

B00DBOF5Q6|4|This is the story of Dorrigo Evans, a surgeon from Tasmania who joins the Army and spends time as a POW in a Japanese camp during World War 2, working on the construction of a Thailand-Burma railway.  His life is shaped by this experience, as well as by an intense love affair before the war.  However the story widens in scope to encompass many of his fellow soldiers, his captors and his family.  It moves forward and back in time - which initially takes some time to get used to - and has a haunting, almost dreamlike quality.<br /><br />I didn't find this book easy to read, partly because of the frequent changes in perspective but mostly because the descriptions of life during the war and the atrocities dealt out by the Japanese are quite simply horrendous.  There is one story late in the book told by a Japanese doctor which I found particularly haunting.  While the book is fiction, parts are based on the life and experiences of the author's father and other parts are based on other real life events.  So there's no easy dismissal in your mind.<br /><br />At one point in the book someone makes a comment along the lines of wartime being comparatively short but feeling like it went forever and this book really captures that.  Flanagan slows down his focus for the wartime segments - taking several chapters to describe a day - and then speeds it up again after the war, jumping years at a time.  While the specific memories are gradually lost, the impact remains.  Which is kind of how I think I will be about this book.
B000002C2E|4|If you're looking for the 1960's Bob Dylan style music, this is not it, but you will love this CD. The music is a little dark, but I really loved it!!!  Bob has demonstrated his ability to change with time and his talent is solidly intact. My favorite song was \\"Standing in the Doorway.\\" It pulled at my heart...I wanted to hug him. \\"Love Sick\\" was the darkest song, and you can feel his contempt. You'll also love \\"Feel My Love\\" in which he expresses his emotions beautifully.  Buy this CD...you will love it too.
0440219078|5|I am about 13 years old and i loved this book.  At first it was confusing but it got really good after the first part.  This is probaly 1 of the best books i have ever read so far!

B0006L16N8|5|The first masterpiece of 2005 has arrived packaged with delicious hype and savory expectations. With \\"X&Y,\\" we finally get a full-course meal. And each course is served will all the trimmings. Nothing is left out this time. \\"Square One\\" opens the album and acts as a tempting appetizer. And like any good appetizer, this one leaves you wanting more. With lyrics like, \\"You're in control is there anywhere you want to go,\\" how you not press forward? Another review pointed out that \\"X&Y\\" asks some interesting questions and the next song \\"What If\\" is the perfect example. It's a very touching and moving song and it really gets to you when you hear the words, \\"What if you should decide/That you don't want me there by your side/That you don't want me there in your life.\\" It really makes you think about someone that's very close and dear to you.    Some have complained about the lyrics, but now that I've had an opportunity to examine them, I have to disagree with those complaining. The music kind of distracts you from the fact that there is really something substantial hidden underneath all the great music. I think they did a better job lyrically than people are really giving them credit for. And when you combine the two, the music and the lyrics, that's when it becomes powerful. It takes on a dream like quality. You get swept away by the composition in its entirety.     The whole is greater than the sum of its individual parts when it comes to \\"X&Y.\\" Each song does have the ability to stand alone as a single vignette, but when you play the album collectively it becomes even more striking. This album just feels more cohesive than AROBTTH. \\"X&Y\\" can be read as one article. That's why this really qualifies as a GREAT album. Everything fits together seamlessly.     But the ultimate reward from listening to Coldplay is that it makes you feel human. It's written on your level and there's a real attempt to make a connection with the person that is listening. The album has an epic feel, but it's done in a very accessible format. I think there's a great and beautiful mythology to Coldplay, to \\"X&Y.\\" There is a great power in myth, and Coldplay captures that essence perfectly.
B000001TVD|5|Even though this represented their third studio album within only one year of existence,Funkadelic were all the way there for the birth of what I call \\"people music\\"-meaning funk that had a strong message and strong musical values. Their self titled debut and [[ASIN:B000001TVB Free Your Mind...And Your Ass Will Follow]] both set the state and made it clear that they intended to set about letting everyone know that \\"a funk band could play rock\\",which is something they'd not only state later but that bands such as Mothers Finest,Living Color and soloists such as Lenny Kravitz and Tricky would realize some years later. And the early 1970's was just the time to do it too because while plenty of the free spirited 60's creative ideal was still in mass consciousness,but there was a new kind of focus in the air. That mixture of ambition and freedom was what allowed for this,what is essentially another short album to be what it is.<br /><br />  For the first time since they became Funkadelic,George Clinton and his band are very clear on their concept. The music is still full of rock riffs and heavy grooving but it's very clearly defined. What gets me about the well known title song is how Eddie Hazel's guitar comes into a mixture of Hendrix's blues,Santana's beauty and..trumpet player Louie Armstrong's understatement. He doesn't play a whole lot of notes but shakes and quivers the ones he does play to bring out the mixed emotions of the melody. \\"Can You Get To That\\",\\"Hit It And Quit It\\",Back In Our Minds\\" and of course \\"You And Your Folks\\" are a somewhat different matter. All are fairly short,to the point funk numbers based with spicy reverbed guitar/piano interaction. Really shows you what a little bit of production can do for live instrumentation. In that spirit these songs celebrate the concepts of wanting to live together BECAUSE of our various differences rather than in spite of them. On the more funk/metal blast of \\"Super Stupid\\" there's a more direct lyrical assault on those who try to stop non conformity.<br /><br />  The album concludes with the instrumental \\"Wars Of Armageddon\\". Musically it's one of the most ambitious pieces Funkadelic had done to this point. Based in a strong abstractly performed afro-latin jazz-/funk type jam similar to what Miles Davis would soon do on his [[ASIN:B00004VWAF On the Corner]] album. Even though it's mixed with founds sounds such as that of people arguing and what sounds like an H Bomb blast at the end (the music continues for a few seconds before fade) the song,as well as the album showcases something about George Clinton's approach to music and production. In a manner similar to Sly Stone he was a master of controlled chaos. While the instrumentation was definitely of the flamboyant sort,his trust of the band members chops really bought out the best and most innovative ideas in them. True no one was ego free every minute for sure. But that has value too. This music is full of self assured power,wit and thoughtfulness. That was an ethic that would not only become the backbone for the as-yet-to-be-Christened P-Funk sound but of the general genre of funk to this point. In a few short years it would be Clinton's style of funk,as opposed to James Brown that would be the central point for it's future innovations. And there's plenty of that going on here.there's a more direct lyrical assault on those who try to stop non conformity.

B001AVCFK6|2|I was so psyched to finally watch this movie. I guess I was just expecting to much. I thought the whole story line was ridiculous. It botherd me that the federation starships kept getting there ass handed to them..including 7 starships at once. I was hoping to see an updated version of the \\"Wrath of Khan \\" starship showdown. Got a lame ass ending instaed. Old spock/new spock...bleh...And jeez...couldn't they just take out the drilling machines chain with a couple of well placed photon torpedo shots???? I watched District 9 and enjoyed it much more than Star Trek...
0811879542|5|The order arrived promptly and my grandson loved the book.  I thought it might be too\\"young\\" for a 5 year old, but he was delighted with it.
B00HB937SU|5|I love Slyvestor Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenager  and I was really happy to see them in Expenables 2.<br />This movie was so enjoyable a pure action movie.  No one expects either star to act in Hamlet, and the<br />two men seem to really enjoy what they do so well.  I'm not a &#34;typical&#34; audience for this movie - a 69 year old female..but  if you take the movie for what it is...you don't watch it for any deep meaning(!) it is a most enjoyable true action movie.
B00KY7PEAA|5|It is a amazing game and every one should really like it that is why I did five stars. I play it every day and I think that every one else should to. AWESOMENESS
1401307450|5|I always loved reading books about musicians and bands because music is one of my main interests in life.  When I read this, I got a lot more though.  At the time in my life when I read it, I was in very dark place in alcohol and drug addiction.  Reading about Anthony Kiedis' own description of what he went through with addiction and overcoming it, it gave me hope that I didn't know existed.  I started to think that if he could do it, maybe I could.  This book is one of my favorites because it planted a seed that played a big role in saving my life.  I don't mean to get all preachy, but that's what the book means to me and that's what it did for me.
B002N7RAH4|4|Well done, all, but it's comedy prevents the &#34;mystery&#34; from ever becoming, well, mysterious.  An interesting categorical question: can a comic-thriller be both?
B006885LZM|4|Great story and lots of action
B00002E23E|5|I've not seen a video of a live performance with such raw energy and talent since watching Led Zep performing in the movie &quot;The Song Remains The same&quot;.  Jimmy Page really tapps into &quot;the Cosmic  Energy&quot; as Robert Plant refers to it.  Some music can really stir the  soul and Zeppelin's music really hits the spot.  It takes certain  frequencies to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and cause one to  feel good; like Hendrix and Pink Floyd they were the masters.  Cosidering  it was 1976 when I first viewed &quot;The Song&quot;,Iwould have to say  that it was ahead of its time especially with the &quot;Dazed and  Confused&quot; clip.
B003ZJ70W4|2|I saw this movie a number of years ago while channel-flipping in hotel at a business conference; it was my daughter who recently ordered it from my Prime account.  For me, this movie epitomizes the &#34;ugly American&#34;; typical arrogant, self-righteous American tourists who, while visiting someone else's home, denigrate their hosts morals, values, and beliefs.  While the actors portrayed &#34;ugly Americans&#34; to a T, the movie as a whole not only failed to recognize the abhorrent behavior but condoned and glorified it as some sort of birth right.  U.S. State Department might want to use this movie as a training guide of how not to act in our neighbors backyard.
B000060K4O|5|Ghostbuster stars Bill Muary and Dan Aykoyd and is funny.  The ghostbusters hunt ghosts in the great city of New York.  Simply, the best of the two movies.<br />  How can you not like this comedy?<br /> One of my favorite lines is  \\"Is this a trick question?\\"
B00HYTLY64|5|My husband loves to sail and I am just learning. We sail along the coast of Maine, know enough to keep us safe in these waters, and are perfectly content. Some of the people who reviewed this movie were critical about the character's lack of proper equipment or the poor choices that the character made. Obviously they are very experienced sailors that have sailed the oceans. As novice sailors.we were too engrossed in the movie to critique those things. Robert Redford did an excellent job of conveying the feelings of the character without dialogue. Much like Tom Hanks in Castaway the frustration and desperation the character felt came across the screen without the need for words.  My husband told me that sailboats could flip over and then right themselves but I had never seen one do that before. The fact that one bad thing after another happened to the character had me sitting on the edge of my seat thinking, &#34; OMG how is he going to get out of this one.&#34; This was on actor on one set doing an entire movie but saying maybe two words. What a challenge for an actor to take on! So it wasn't perfect in every detail, what is. It was a great movie with fabulous acting and an interesting ending. Don't panic and don't give up are lessons that we can all use in any situation.
1570627215|4|This was a beautiful moving tale of one mans' journey to enlightenment.  He reaches perfection by shedding and attaining several different identities; first, he is a Brahmnin's son; second, he is an aesthete and shramana; third, he is a hedonist and wealthy gambler; then, finally, he is a ferryman and lover of a river.  Finally he reaches perfection.<br />Ideas mean little to him in the end, and unity is everything.

B0014YVC6W|5|...as the sticker states on the outer cellophane of this BluRay.  Well,,,,, AWESOME! But unfortunately awesome isn't enough to describe the superior quality of this BluRay. It looks better than it ever did on the big screen, when the movie first came out! LOL  While I realize that there can be so many variances for each individual film (including DURING INITIAL PRODUCTION), if there is a current  benchmark to measure BluRay quality, this has to be near, or at the top!  This transfer also looks better than many other movies on BluRay, many of which have also come out long after Short Circuit! Anyway, I hope that as many as possible older movies can be transfered to BluRay with the end-result being a level of quality at least equal to, or near, this! :)
B007FEFLTO|5|Loved this book & love this series!
B00QR7ZM8A|5|Awesome and restrained versions of these classics is a good side-step for Dylan.

B00FLDG5AA|5|THIS COULD BE THE LAST CROSSROADS FESTIVAL.GREAT MUSIC
B00ULRVBGY|4|Enjoyable, fun, and at times not enough information on how to play. I was confused on how to collect and payout activity points. I left a guild because I wasn't contributing enough. All it needed was a side note on the guild activity points total as to how what where... best way to collect activity points use raid cards to pick up dropped loot and power up the heroes, but this is costly, it takes a lot of stamina, which is bought with gems. I figured this out by just trying to get certain items for my heroes promotion. This gives them more power. But it's the cost of gems or the amount of time it takes to earn 600 activity points the slow way that keeps me from giving this game 5 stars.
B0002YCVXI|5|Cello sound reminds me a human voice. When I hear a cello, I feel something inside my chest. I cannot explain this, but I feel very deeply the cello voice. It's a very emotional experience for me. That's why I love it very much!<br /><br />Recently, I discovered, that Yo-Yo Ma plays Morricone. I am sure you know the music of the famous Italian composer Ennio Morricone. Now, imagine all his famous titles are re-arranged for cello and orchestra. CD includes the most relaxing themes from such movies as The Mission, Cinema Paradiso, Once Upon a Time in America, The Untouchables and many others.<br /><br />I recommend this CD to fans of classical crossover, soundtrack lovers and those who just need to relax with an excellent music.
B000NA28IE|4|Having seen this movie without reading the book, my perception of the movie is enjoyable.  I thought it was a really fun movie and am strongly considering purchasing.  However, I do agree with most reviews about how there needed to be more character and plot development.  Now I need to go read the book to find out what REALLY happens.
1563523302|5|This book dispels a lot of myths about wealth, who has it, how they got it, and how they keep hold of it. <br /> <br />As insightful now as it was a dozen years ago.  This is a great book that should be required reading for anybody who wants to retire financially secure.
0141439807|5|If all the Austen books were sisters, Mansfield Park would be the quiet, pensively courageous sibling of the six. Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion all seem to glow like ladies at a ball. (Northanger Abbey would, I guess, be the sister who plays piano and can't really sing...although she tries...)<br /><br />I felt this novel to have a wonderfully theatrical feel, a closet drama of sorts. The above novels are like social epics whereas Mansfield Park appears stately, stoic and unto itself, thoughtful in a way the others aren't. I still think the other novels are excellent but there is something reserved about this one in particular. I am not a dedicated Austen lover but I would chose this one over the others simply because it is the less popular and to me, the most fascinating. The social-relationship dynamics are similar to the other novels - i.e. learning that the pretty face doesn't always have a pretty soul.<br /><br />Let's put it this way, I'll probably read this novel again before the others. This is the sister I would like to know, to talk with and share philosophy with. The other sisters, in my opinion are great to dance with and they'll certainly entertain you. Nothing wrong in that.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Starts out slow but then gets interesting.
B003XKPPOU|5|Pixar gets human nature more than any movie studio out there, and then carefully crafts screenplays and characters that make us laugh, make us cry on occasion, and always make us totally forget we are watching an animated film.  We become part of it.  And in the hands of Pixar, that is never a bad thing.  I think what distinguishes this film from the previous two, other than the leap in animation technology and the studio's experience  in telling stories, is the wicked sense of humor in this screenplay.  And executing that humor in a script which  appeals to at least three generations of moviegoers without letting it be at the expense of the younger audience.<br /><br />Andy's leaving home.  Without giving away too much of the plot, what we see here is a sensitive lesson in the difference in loss from abandonment and neglect, and loss from growing up and moving on.  And the difference between the two.  The storyline with Lotso demonstrates that you can't always read a book by it's cover, and that bullies can smell like strawberries too.  That big babies can be evil when they fall in with the wrong crowd.  Ken modeling his wardrobe for Barbie shows that even macho guys like Ken have a weakness for clothes.  And Spanish Space men make cowgirls go weak in the knees, especially in dangerous situations.  I haven't laughed this hard since seeing Lucy and Ethel dance on grapes, and haven't cried this hard since the beginning of the mortgage crisis.<br /><br />People die.  Kids leave home.  Recycling is good.  And if you bully the other kids too much, you just might end up being a hood ornament on a garbage truck.  Thanks Pixar.  Alongside The King's Speech, it was the best of 2010.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version is stunning.  The colors are rich, the detail sharp and crisp, and enough special features to keep you busy for hours.  No one can package a Blu-Ray like Disney.
B0091REZMW|4|Good fun. Not as much fun as other games in this genre.  Could have more variety, better interface, and easier to navigate.
B00005JPLW|1|I saw the movie in theaters and would rate it at 5 stars however the 1 star I gave it is because I just watched the regular dvd (not Blueray or HD) and from the very beginning I couldn't get past how bad the movie looked.  I mean its absolutely horrible, its grainy, fuzzy, might as well be a snowstorm on my television if it was for that fact the movie has color.  Not sure how the high def versions are or if I just happened to have a bad version, which if I do please someone let me know as I need to get a different copy but as it stands don't buy this movie on regular ol DVD as its horrible.
B00005JLCE|5|I absolutely love this movie.  Very cute and funny.  Madonna played an awesome part and did a GREAT job.   A++ in my book.
B008AK8FHM|5|I recently have had several losses and it has been really hard to understand why.  This book has been not only an eye opener, but a great comfort to me.  I highly recomend this book to anyone who has lost a loved one.
B00BAXFJ5M|5|I could not put the book down until I finished and then was sorry I had finished.  I love the characters Maxwell and King so I was thrilled when Mr. Baldacci wrote this new book about them.  I hope he will write more books about their adventures.
1932100660|5|I was so intrigued by reading the \\"Look Inside\\" excerpt pages for this book on Amazon that I ordered a copy for myself and even sent one to my mother who has her own health problems she's battling.  After reading the book in its entirety, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The author began as an unbelieving opponent to the idea that eating a diet rich in animal protein caused disease, so he sets out to set the record straight, only he ended up proving himself wrong.  The author cites study after study that he has either done himself or referenced to support the health benefits of a plant-based vegan diet, free of any animal products: milk, meat, fish, eggs, cheese.  In his research, he uses casein, a protein which is found in milk, to support the idea that the progression of diseases including cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune disease, which he names \\"diseases of affluence,\\" is the culprit that is killing us.  To further support his argument, he uses data from multiple countries around the world where these diseases are virtually non-existent, primarily in regions where plant-based diets are the main source of nourishment.  The more meat and milk that people eat in any area, the more these diseases seem to be present.<br /><br />Whether or not you choose to change your lifestyle by what you read in this book is up to you.  However, I really think this should be mandatory reading for every individual, healthy or those with diseases.  I have been meat-free for over a month and am just starting to realize the beneficial changes occurring to my body.  Once you read it, you decide what's right for you.
B00BSBR9N6|4|Fun, entertaining and well written. I really liked the characters and their interactions.
B0031ED20M|5|I know I haven't read many of John Grisham's books, but after this one I'd love to pick up another.  This book is comprised of seven short, entertaining stories.  They each have a very real problem that an average person may be able to identify with.   The two main things that I loved about each story was that they didn't take long and there wasn't hardly any violence or death.  Of course there was conflict in each; however, it wasn't overwhelming.    My favorite was the last story entitled Funny Boy. It had several humorous parts that made me laugh even though there was a serious message that Grisham was conveying throughout.  The relationship that formed between two people who led such complete and opposite lifestyles proves that one never knows who they may become friends with!

B00N1ZCGWG|2|I don't like the format of this app.
B004RYVE3W|4|This is a great annotated edition. Very few redundent notations. The only reason it did not get five stars is because in two spots the annotator comments on Mary Crawford speaking unusual views for women at the time. Which would be fine except in one instance it isn't her speaking and in another instance she's not even in the room and really it is Edmund speaking. Other than that it was very interesting. Especially for the price which is very reasonable compared to the ten dollar and up annotated editions. Another thing that I liked about it was that next to the annotation links he had letters indicating if it was an opinion, word, or historical note which made it much nicer to be able to skip words that I already know the meaning of.
B003Y5H53S|1|I got this delivered from Amazon because generally I like animated movies. I don't have kids and don't have any affiliation with kids so this review is not with kids in mind. Yes there was mildly strong language, get over it.     the visuals were stunning. Details were awesome on the animation. And that's it. The story dragged, the plot was forever being delayed and I fell asleep the first time I watched it. I thought maybe it was because I was tired but the second time wasn't any better. This movie is just bad. I liked some of the action scenes but too much of this was reminicient of Dungeon Crawl. Slogging through the crap to get to the treasure and when we get there it turns out the treasure is an old shoe. Or in this case an old gunslinger. I really wanted to like this movie but it fell flat to me. I suppose some people liked it but I just couldn't stay into it.
B00B1LKXZ4|5|It came in quickly and very safely. I was scared about getting a used copy, but I must admit that I am very satisfied with my purchase
B00F35B8F8|5|Loved it.  Great reimagining of the Star Trek universe.  Great acting and enough plot differences to make this stand on it's own and be wholly original from the first &#34;Khan&#34; movie.
0760335540|5|This book is great - written descriptions for how to's are excellent and the photos with identifying features is right on target. Not only informs about routine tasks but provides references for add ons and improvemnents in a way that helps make decisions to do or not to do. I highly reccomend the book, you can't go wrong with this one.

Darn it all.!<br />I think the attempt was wonderful but the outcome just not that moving...  Samantha Barks is the best of the entire ensemble.  I sincerely am trying to love this recording as much as I love every other album recorded in the name of Les Miserables.... THE GREATEST BOOK TO MUSICAL EVER!!!!!!

B003VANOFY|5|Im a Virtual DJ with an online presence and let me tell you that after multiple hour sets with other headsets my ears , face and often the top of my scalp often hurt. Iv'e tried multiple sets and each of them had there pros and cons ofcourse. However , After deciding to take the plunge into wireless and drop some cash into a new headset I set my sights on the G930. I can tell you that I will never turn away from it. It hosts a range of options and benefits including increased comfort , range and settings to maximize your experience and requirements. The battery life is spot on and every bit of 10 Hours , plus the ability to talk while charging and a quick charge is a bonus.    They are larger than most but because the ear peices fit over the ears and rest around them you feel no discomfort and it maximizes the surround sound feature.    All I can truly say is .. If you dont atleast consider these as an option your not doing yourself any favors nor are you including what is certainly on of the top quality headsets available.

0307269981|5|I have never reviewed anything before, because I am not always able to put thoughts into written words.  But I had to say something about this book. After reading the first book I was really anxious to read this one, and it did not disappoint!  The is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read!  I could not put it down!  Larsson weaves a wonderfully complex story, with fascinating characters.  This book was better than the first, and if the third book is better, then five stars won't be enough!  What a tragedy that there will be no more.
B000OVLINI|5|Fantastic story.  Very different.
B00A0ABQLM|5|We purchased our first Anker product based on the reviews other Amazon customers left.  We, too, find their products to be of very high quality and perform as advertised. I'm using the USB 3.0 Ethernet LAN network adapter.  It is not a sophisticated device, so there just isn't much to go on about.  It performs exactly as I expected it to.<br /><br />Like most Apple products, Anker has those intangible, subjective qualities of style and `over-builtness' that you don't need, but that make you feel better for having it.

B00AQ3K8IU|5|Not sure what else to say.  Colleen Hoover did an excellent job writing these characters.  VERY hard book to put down.  She makes you happy, sad and hold your breath multiple times while reading this book.  I heard someone call it depressing but I totally disagree.  Every book has it's sad points and this one does to but to say it was depressing is totally wrong.....and the ending....OMG what a GREAT way to end the book.  I think you will truly fall in love with this book.  This is one I could read again and again.

B00006RU5B|5|When Soundgarden disbanded in 1997, singer Chris Cornell ventured into his own side projects, but they were less than a success, so when Zach de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine three years later, Chris found himself a new home. The band adopted the name Audioslave when it came to them in a vision, and, after Chris left and rejoined the group, they released their debut album in 2002.<br /><br />It may be because I loved Rage so damn much, and I wanted Audioslave to pick up where Rage left off, but it took me several listens to warm up to this album. I actually fell asleep the first time I listened to it, and even though I was well rested when I listened to it the next few times, I was still very lukewarm on this C.D.. But, about a year after I gave up on it, and after Audioslave's sophomore album was released, I eventually gave this disc another try. When I did, I was blown away.<br /><br />Audioslave do not pick up where Rage Against the Machine left off; they are two completely different bands. This is mainly because, unlike Zach de la Rocha, Chris Cornell doesn't have a voice born to rap. If he tried it, it would probably be hilarious. Also, his voice isn't strong enough to yell over heavy rock, so Tom, Tim, and Brad have to play somewhat restrained. But, even though this C.D. is more alternative than anything Rage put out, it isn't 100% Soundgarden, either. It's a lot less grungy sounding, and guitarist Tom Morello can still wail, and he isn't afraid to show it.<br /><br />1. \\"Cochise\\" is the first single, a personal favorite of mine, and probably the heaviest song on the record. The first fifty seconds or so is a slow drum beat, but then the guitars go wild in typical Tom Morello fashion, while the bass omits a slow wah-wah sound, and Chris lets loose a few pretty big yells.<br />2. \\"Show Me How to Live\\" begins with a few riffs and a catchy drum beat, then the guitar riffs become faster and Chris makes some humming noises. The guitars make a beeping sound in the verses, but the choruses explode and both Tom and Chris wail.<br />3. \\"Gasoline\\" features a brief wall of guitar crunch at the beginning. Chris then proceeds to sing properly in the verses and, even though he raises his voice in the choruses, he doesn't ever yell. There's also a brief wah-wah guitar solo after one of the choruses.<br />4. \\"What You Are\\" has calm, restrained verses, making the riff heavy choruses kind of surprising.<br />5. \\"Like a Stone\\" has choruses which have moderately sized riffs, but the verses consist of a repetitive drum beat and light, spacey guitar plucking which almost sounds acoustic at times. Another guitar solo is thrown in here, as well.<br />6. \\"Set it Off\\" is a good choice for the fifth single. It has a weird, almost robotic guitar noise at the beginning and a really catchy chorus (where Chris yells \\"Set it off! Set this f-cker off!\\")<br />7. The first 45 seconds of \\"Shadow of the Sun\\" has light guitar strumming which almost sounds like a piano. The bass and drums kick eventually kick in before the chorus, where the guitars make a low buzzing noise. Chris' yells in the choruses are catchy, but his voice almost borders on whiney. This song seems restrained until the end, where it finally opens up and Tom gets to do his thing.<br />8. \\"I Am the Highway\\" has twinkling guitar noise and proper crooning. This song doesn't detonate like tracks 1-7 did, but it's not supposed to; this song is almost a semi-ballad. It's still catchy, though, thanks to the vocals.<br />9. \\"Exploder\\" sort of makes up for track eight's lack of riffs. I enjoy how Chris sings during this song's chorus, then the chorus suddenly begins and he yells over loud, downshifting riffs.<br />10.\\"Hypnotize\\" features beeping guitars which makes part of this song sound like a laser/light show.<br />11. \\"Bring `Em Back Alive\\" has light dwindling guitar notes, making this song sort of sound like the old RATM song \\"Born of a Broken Man.\\" The vocals in the verses are extended and sound like a vocal synthesizer, but the choruses are a lot louder, with big, stop-start riffs.<br />12. \\"Light My Way\\" is another restrained rocker, with wah-wah guitars and a low, rumbling bass. The choruses again jump in volume, when the crunchy, almost pounding riffs make an entrance.<br />13. \\"Getaway Car\\" has a great melody, with soft guitar notes and good singing (Chris sings the catchy line \\"Ooo-hoo.\\")<br />14. \\"The Last Remaining Light\\" is another sluggish song, with good melody. It has a slow, thumping drum beat and a guitar which sounds like a synthesizer.<br /><br />So, Chris joining forces with Tom, Tim and Brad was a big surprise, but it was an even bigger surprise that Audioslave's debut was so good. This album was an experiment, but the results were uncannily great. Audioslave might be the best alt metal band since Tool, and this is the best debut I've heard since Rage's 1992 self-titled album. I suggest this C.D. to fans of both Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, as well as all fans of alt metal. And, as always, make sure you listen with an open mind.uses are a lot louder, with big, stop-start riffs.   12. \\"Light My Way\\" is another restrained rocker, with wah-wah guitars and a low, rumbling bass.

She has maxed credit cards and an incredibly overdrafted bank account.  But, surprisingly, this does not stop her from frequenting shops and cafes during her lunch hour.  Rebecca is aware of her problem, however, and tries to do better.  Her schemes for cutting back, saving money and making more money are downright funny, inventive and quite honestly, desperate.<br />Confessions of a Shopaholic makes it's mark.  One of the Top 10 best British novels I have ever read.  Definitely a pick-me-up if not a confessional for others who suffer from Overshopping Syndrome.  Will absolutely appease those who crave lighthearted, fun comedy with a message.  Two dollar-signs up!
B000089RVX|5|After bringing home &quot;Fallen&quot; and listening to the first track, I was completely sucked in. Beautiful female vocals with great guitar riffs-- perfect combination! There's enough on this CD to satisfy everyone's musical taste, from light piano driven songs to all out rock to more electronic based. Everyone should check out Evanescence if you already haven't!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Love, love, LOVE, this series! It is exciting to see/imagine how the higher society lived during this time period, as well as how the service people lived.

B00DSS7B0S|4|More than the original 3 album set, this 6 CD set gives a good overview of the music from the festival. Some of the music was very good, some borders on the unlistenable, but this is over all a good listen and great to have in a collection. The booklet that came with the CD's was interesting and fun to read. One sour note: The packaging was terrible. The plastic case was falling apart as soon as I removed the shrink wrap and it is extremely frustrating to try to get the CD's back in the case.
B00KZ6WRAA|1|If it has less than one star than I would choose that rating.

6305263248|4|An excellent action thriller from director John Frankenheimer which I saw at the cinema twice and never tire of watching to this day. Frankenheimer is a top notch director having also made \\"The French Connection II\\" and \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" (the original 1960's version). The cast includes Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Jonathon Pryce and Sean Bean. All are excellent and the opening setup scenes are tremendously well-done, with Frankenheimer making proper use of DeNiro and Reno's magnetic screen presences.<br /><br />The plot concerns the retrivial of a mysterious brief case. All of the above cast members are hired mercenaries paid to get it back for an Irish lady. This is where the title comes from. Ronin were effectively freelance Samarai. Frankenheimer has some great set pieces in this film, including a fabulous car chase and the initial exchange of money and weapons. There is nice cameo role for Michael Lonsdale (The Day of the Jackal).
B00B5HQLMI|3|This moving just isn't up to the &#34;Bond Experience&#34; just felt too fake.
0761172726|5|This is my 5th year using this calendar. The spaces for each family member are so useful and the design is well laid-out and very cute.  I use this in addition to an electronic calendar and it keeps my whole family up-to-date on what is happening. It's great to see at a glance for each day what is going on for everyone. I find the spaces to be plenty big for our needs. We have a family of four so I use the last column to do my weekly dinner menu planning.
038572179X|3|Briony is an imaginative child,  an aspiring author.  Her fantasies usually revolve around heroines, falls from glory and happy endings.  Performing her dramas is also one of Briony's passons and \\"The Fall of Arabella\\" was to be the latest production, done in honor of her college-age brother's return from school.<br />The description of the preparations, including role rehearsals by less-than-talented cousins, easily enamor the reader to precocious Briony.  That changes dramatically when one of her cousins, Lola, is ... assaulted shortly after Briony witnessed an intimate scene between her sister Cecelia and a would-be lover, Robbie Turner. <br />Robbie Turner is the son of the Tallis family's charlady and has been a favorite of the head of the Tallis household...so much so that Robbie has been college educated by the senior Tallis and he has also agreed to fund Robbie's subsequent medical education.  As an aside, it is interesting to see that the British social structure is such that Mrs. Tallis finds such financial backing of someone from the servant class to be inappropriate.  For that matter, the education of her eldest daughter, Cecelia, seems a waste of money as well.  The quest for an appropriate husband is far more important!<br />Briony utilizes her flair for the dramatic and her penchant for heroics to decide that Robbie has assaulted her sister and the dark figure she witnessed running away from her cousin's assault scene could be no other than Robbie.  He is arrested, even though Briony immediately begins to doubt her own pronouncements, and Robbie spends several years in prison.<br />Time is then propelled forward to Robbie's participation in World War II and the flight from Dunkirk.  Cecelia is a nurse and Briony is a nursing student, exposed to the brutalities of war as critically injured men are returned from the front.  Briony lives the full brunt of her guilt, knowing full well who her cousin's true assailant is.<br />The ending of the story takesan interesting turn and it is for the reader to discover.  Briony is in her seventies; she knows that her life is nearing its end.  She is a famous author with a book that cannot be published during her lifetime.  Therein lies the twist and the reader is left to his/her imagination!<br />The story is slow moving at times and is more interesting through the war years, Briony's final confrontation of her own guilt and the destruction she has caused within her own family.
B00006B1HH|5|This is my all-time favorite movie, as well as my cousins'.  This was a gift for her.  The movie is the best, if you haven't seen it, watch it.<br /><br />The shipper was kind, quick, and the movie was delivered in MINT condition.  Thank you very much.
B00005JN0T|4|When I first saw this movie in cinema, I thought it was o.k.  Now, I've seen it again on DvD, and enjoyed it even more than I did back then, in August 2004.     The movie takes place in the year 2035, which is pretty hard to believe, seeing that is the world in 30 years. (very Scfi)  But it doesn't matter that much, does it? :)  But this movie is pure fun: It has great caracters, great action, great humor and... Will Smitt.  He's perfect for the rol of the \\"anti-robot-cop\\" Dell Spooner, and plays his part with great humor, and great acting.  Bridget Moynahan also plays a great part as the beautiful doctor Calvin.     The action and the special effects in this movie are superb, great fun to watch. Like the cool car scene, and the endbattle are great.     It's also a very good story, that gives another look at the future and another look at robots.     Defenitly a must-see.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Great show!  I am hooked-I watched all 3 seasons over the summer, and can't wait for season four in 2014!
B0001A79JO|5|This album is awesome!  The problem is with many people who buy it expecting to hear psychobilly.  This is a side project w/ members of other psychobilly bands.  This is supposed to be a mix of new wave, punk, and just good old fashioned rock n' roll and it delivers everything that Kim Nekroman (guitarist) promises.  All the tracks are great, especially the surf rock-esk track Horror Beach.  <br />If you like The Nekromantix you'll like this album.  If you like Blondie... you'll like this album.  If you like any punk, rockabilly, or psychobilly get this CD.  <br />Contrary to popular sceptism, there are no links between Patricia's attitude and Gwen's attitude from No Doubt.  I've heard No Doubt, and I've heard the HorrorPops and I can honestly say that people who claim there is a likeness in attitude are just plain wrong.  Patricia has a style all unto her own.
B004GYY714|5|Works perfectly. I get all my favorite stations and have discovered several others! Additional features (like sleep timer) all contribute.
6300213803|5|All in all, this movie could have been the greatest Trek movie ever made.  If &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; hadn't been so fantastic, that is.  This movie looks great, sounds great, has fabulous character development, and a  sadistic villian. Unfortunatly, it is also very long and contains a  schmaltzy end sequence.  Otherwise, just great.
B004SBS8LA|5|great product!
B008Q09K2U|1|I bought this book for my kindle with excitement having read a number of the author's older books. I am struggling to read it now at 19% through. The character is ridiculous. The supposed wisecracks seem bigoted and tired and the story is going nowhere. I am so disappointed with the book. I am sure the last time I read DeMille there was an interesting, clever and action packed story. None of those elements are present in this book to date.

B004JXXKWY|5|Michael Lewis narrates the 2008 financial meltdown from the point of view of the winners: actual people who bet the market would collapse and won big. In the meantime, he explains how the sausage (swaps, CDO, CDS) was made and the nefarious role of the so called “rating agencies” and all the intermediates who knew what they were doing but could not stop because it was so profitable.<br /><br />He follows three main protagonists: a “garage” fund owned by three two hippies and a disgruntled banker, a mid-size “normal” hedge fund and a big investment bank (Deutsche Bank), all of who bet against the mortgage industry. He names names and makes the tale very reading because you start cheering for the somewhat quixotic and flawed protagonists.<br /><br />As usual with his books, this is a page turner that you don’t put aside until the end.
B005544TRQ|5|Great show.
B008476HBM|3|If this were written today it would be classed as a romance novel. I found it annoying that the women in the story were waiting helplessly in hopes that some man would marry them so they could have a life. Men and women both in this book are looking to marry for money and position.  Our main character's father has no money to speak of so she has little hope of a good marriage. However, in true romance novel style a rich good looking man rides in and marries her anyway. Interesting as a curiosity but not my kind of book.
B007ZXK08C|4|I enjoyed the book very much. It was well written and the story flowed well.

B006TQUNX8|3|I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth.
0792839730|1|To give the film its due, the cast is awe-inspring: Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins (young, at that), Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, James Caan, Laurence Olivier, Elliott Gould, and Denholm Elliott head a  cast seemingly of thousands. However, once one gets past seeing this  assemblage &quot;all in the same room&quot; so to speak, there is nothing  else to be impressed with and many things with which to be annoyed.<br />The  film centers on the enormous WWII airborne operation to take a corridor of  bridges leading to Arnhem. Most of the named stars are the commanders of  units in the operation and many of the same commanders served as military  consultants to the film. Normally I would applaud such authenticity, but it  is this film's Achilles' heel. From the first minutes, we see these  commanders protesting the insane plot hatched by the top brass, including  Montgomery. It is impossible to suspend one's belief so far to assume that  Monty, etc., were as supremely stupid as the film suggests, and after  nearly three hours of this treatment, the ending is tediously inevitable.  <br />The DVD version sets an even lower standard. This epic has lengthy  scenes in German and Dutch, but when listening to the English language  version, no subtitles appear for these scenes. One must turn on English  subtitles for the whole movie--an annoying distraction--and even then the  subtitles disappear in some crucial sections of foreign dialogue! The  subtitles also appear partly over the picture, which is inexcusable in a  widescreen edition. The video is a poor, pixelated transfer, crying out for  a remastering. Finally, the DVD has no extra features, other than the  theatrical trailer.

B000006O7C|4|Jeff Buckley's tragic death in May 1997 left millions of fans and admirers wondering, \\"What would've come next?\\"  After Jeff's debut, Grace, it seemed like anything could be in the works for his next album, and three years passed with little definitive new material from the painstaking artist.  His death only ensured that no definitive new recordings would EVER surface - but, thankfully, he left behind a treasure trove of nearly-completed songs that, in my opinion, were more than ready for release.  Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk shows that Jeff's talent was growing and changing in new ways that would've likely gotten him a far larger audience than Grace's quirky experimentation did. <br /> <br />The first disc consists of studio demos done with Jeff's band and producer Tom Verlaine.  These recordings are nearly release-quality; the sound is very good, although the vocal takes are not quite as perfect as Jeff doubtless would have preferred.  The sound of the material is less distinctive than on Grace; it's a bit more in the alternative vein of the 90's, with a large hint of Buckley-style melodicism thrown in.  The material is also not as varied as Grace, but especially lyrically, Jeff was headed in new directions.  \\"The Sky is a Landfill\\" contains apocalyptic lyrics which are visionary, as opposed to the heavy romanticism often found on Grace.  In my opinion, the lyrics are more mature on this record, and perhaps more focused.  It's stuff that would've definitely gotten large amounts of radio airplay, and had it been released in '97, would've no doubt been given credit for influencing the post-alternative scene of the late 90's.   <br /> <br />Disc 2 consists of home recordings of Jeff trying some pretty wild things, as well as a few better-recorded ditties.  \\"New Year's Prayer\\" and \\"Nightmares by the Sea\\" are also on this 2nd disc, in largely recreated form.  The middle portion of the disc contains really strange, atonal stuff that sounds kind of like Sonic Youth; the noisy break in the middle of \\"So Real\\" on Grace is nothing compared to the noise-art that fills \\"Murder Suicide Meteor Slave\\" and \\"Demon John\\".  I'm not a fan of the middle of this disc, but at the end, what would've been Jeff's next signature cover, \\"Satisfied Mind\\", wraps things up in a typically engaging solo Buckley performance reminiscient of \\"Hallelujah\\" off of Grace. <br /> <br />If you already have Grace, Sketches is an excellent overview of what the next album from Buckley might've sounded like.  If you are new to Buckley, I would pick up Grace first, because it's really what his legacy is all about, at least as far as definitive work goes.  However, this compilation serves as proof that Jeff Buckley was far more than a one-album wonder and instead was a truly visionary, passionate, and talented musician and artist.

B00HHJOH2Y|5|We were just so excited to be able to see Despicable Me 2.  We had seen the original, and were so delighted with the whole movie, and were a little leery about the second one, but we were not disappointed.  My grandchildren viewed it two nights in a row and thought it was totally awesome.
B0031RS2HC|4|For a start I thought that Lee was going to be female since the person who recommended the book to me seems to prefer female authors . Then I started to read the book and really found it hard to tear myself away.<br /><br />Never have I read so much horror and gore. If previously warned I would have rejected the book instantly. However the more I read the more inconsequential it was to the thrust of the work and yet it was pivotal to the story.<br /><br />I would hate to give any of the story line away I would just recommend that people read the book and then go and buy some more. Lee Child has me hooked.
B00631HASU|5|Very addictive game.
B0071XO8RA|4|This story is told in a way that pulls you right into the Silo.  You feel like you are right in there with the characters.  Loved it!

B000HWXO4U|1|I would just like to thank amazon for providing absolutely no content information for this DVD.  for all I know it could be filled with \\"Coach\\" reruns.  would it kill them to provide a track listing?  I mean this is a U.S. release and not some German import.  the link they suggest for \\"more information on this product\\" is useless.  needless to say, amazon has made it way too much work to buy this product from them.  Perhaps Boarders.com may be more informative.
0811875555|5|I thoroughly enjoy this book and the artwork included therein. Glen Keane is one of the most dynamic and expressive artists out there and the other artists included here are phenomenal as well. Paintings and sketches are topnotch.
B007MDB71O|4|This film was a nice adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' book &#34;A Princess of Mars.&#34; There were some creative liberties taken with the characters and story line, but that was okay with me. I am glad that John and Dejah wore clothing, as skimpy as it was  (they didn't wear much if anything in the book, which was rather stupid given the environment on Mars as described by Burroughs himself). I liked the Tharks and Disney did a better job at reconciling one culture with another (green and red Martians [Barsoomians] in this case) than scfi fans were subjected to by another movie producer in the Star Wars prequels with the Gungans. There was a little politically correct meddling apparent in the film, but the commentary was generally short-lived.  I have learned over the years that Pixar influence = good, Disney influence = not so good.
B00F9040HU|5|Doesn't seem to be available for the new kindle. Really love the game but would like to get with my new kindle please do an update!
B000VSBX34|5|I liked how this movie was in color, set aside from the other Beatles movie that was released in black and white, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" to be certain. The Beatles had so many great songs in this film, songs that are featured on their album \\"Help!\\" such as the title song, and other great hits like \\"Another Girl,\\" \\"You're Gonna Lose That Girl,\\" \\"Ticket To Ride,\\" \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away,\\" and \\"I Need You.\\" The songs are all in their original recordings as is on the \\"Help!\\" album, released in 1965. A must-have for any and all die-hard Beatles fans of all ages!!!
B00CH3DBNQ|5|I enjoyed this book.  How does one so young think ahead so far into the future ?<br /><br />This was one of the best books that  shows  such insight , farsighted caring for the future of her country.
B001V7UXG2|5|Extremely well done period piece.  This comedy takes place in both England and in New York City.  Based on the books of P.G. Woodhouse.  The episodes can be watched over and over and never fail to delight.  Starring Stephen Fry as Jeeves the intellectual valet and Hugh Laurie as his dim witted high society master.  Interspersed with songs of the day many performed by Hugh Laurie on piano and voice.  Great fun!
B000N6U0E2|5|Great and touching story about  everyday challenges that the poor face.

B00CWV8TIU|5|I thoroughly enjoyed Side Effects. I could see what happened to the psychiatrist happening to anybody that thinks they are taking the correct action.
B00DHNBPA6|3|About what i expected, but I really wanted to kick that blonde hippy in the A($* - completely stupid - he's supposed to be smart, yet he reads aloud from the book,, invoking the demon. He is one of the more unsympathetic characters in the film. You'd expect him to be supportive of his friend trying to go cold turkey off of drugs (not a good thing to do in a remote cabin away from medical care even w/o the demons!) yet he basically writes her off and says it won't work from the start, then dishes it out to the older brother, who happened to have gotten a job and moved to a different city - and he is actually angry and claims that means he isn't there for them anymore? When did getting a life and a job and moving on in your life become a bad thing? Oh, yeah, when you're a slacker hippy, that's right!  I wish he'd been the first to get offed, but, alas, I had to verbally malign his acting for about 80 percent of the movie.
B00JGMK6VG|5|Awesome movie

B0000AZJXQ|5|APC has really moved forwards with this album. It is longer and more interesting than Mer De Noms.<br />1. Package - Starts off slow but gradually turns into the heaviest song on the album. The lyrics are reminiscent of Flood from Tool's Undertow. 5/5.<br />2. Weak and Powerless - The first single from the album. Incredible lyrics and guitar but gets a little repetitive. 3.5/5.<br />3. The Noose - Beautiful song with great drums and vocals. It has an incredible ending that sounds a bit like 3 Libras, and it will likely be the second single. 4/5.<br />4. Blue - Interesting guitar effects, good beat in the chorus sections. There is a bit of strange-sounding reverb on the lyrics near the end. 4/5.<br />5. Vanishing - Below-average song, unmemorable. Lyrics about disappearing into the air. 2/5.<br />6. Stranger - Slow song with some VERY strange yelling noises in the middle. Lyrics about sex with tomatoes and what to do with silence. How about making some interesting songs to fill it? 2.5/5.<br />7. Outsider - Now THIS is more like it. My favorite song on the album, heavy and angry, awesome vocals and guitars. Lyrics are about fame and vanity. 5/5.<br />8. Crimes - Shortest song on the album, good drums but not much else. Total filler track. 1.5/5.<br />9. The Nurse who Loved Me - Total old-school orchestral rock song, sounds a bit like King Crimson. Violins and vocals make up most of it. It's a cover from a band called Failure, but i haven't heard that version yet. I love this song because it's so cheesy and classic sounding. 5/5.<br />10. Pet - Pretty heavy song with insane lyrics, and apparently with guest vocals by Devo, Maynard's son. A bit of great guitar solo makes this one of my favorite songs on the album. 5/5.<br />11. Lullabye - A continuation of Pet, with a girl with a nice voice singing softly. Very short song, basically filler. 1.5/5.<br />12. Gravity - The finale is a great song with amazing vocals, and a message to leave you with: \\"I choose to live.\\" 4/5.<br />Overall, it's hard to say which is better, Mer De Noms or Thirteenth Step. They're both art-metal albums and they both kick some serious @$$. I give this one 5 stars simply because I LOVED the Nurse song, otherwise i might have given it a 4. The half-naked girl from the Weak and Powerless video appears in the liner notes and on the back of the cd as an added bonus ;). There are more codes to decipher in the liner notes, like there were in Mer De Noms. This is a great album, but do NOT mistake it for Tool. They are completely different bands, so try not to compare them too much. 5/5.
B008Y78AO4|5|Great movie!
B0000931QA|5|To truly recognize the magnitude of Operation:Mindcrime, you must examine the state of popular music at the time this record was released.  This reminds me of Permanent Waves by Rush, which entirely blew everything else around it out of the water.<BR>How can you equate &quot;Don't Worry be Happy&quot; (Bobby McFerrin) or &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot; (Guns and Roses) with the chorus of Suite Sister Mary?<BR>Forget Nirvana or Alice in Chains; Queensryche is the band that started the Seattle music revolution.  Take this from someone who is diametrically opposed to just about any political leaning of this band:  The undeniable truth is that Queensryche delivered message, theme, and complexity before it was cool.<BR>Given the climate of today's music, we will probably never see its equal.<BR>With Pink Floyd's The Wall and Rush's Permanent Waves, Operation:Mindcrime completes the holy trinity of 70's- 80's studio achievements.<BR>If you pride yourself as being one who appreciates good music regardless of its airtime or popularity, Operation:Mindcrime is a test.  Give it a listen, and you'll ask yourself as I do, where are efforts like this today?<BR>Sadly, they aren't there.  VH-1 is too busy praising bands like Metallica for the Black Album.

B00E9PMMX0|5|Honestly, They are classic Sci-Fi Movies that I loved when they came out the first time. I had to get them on Blu-ray to watch a time or two before number 7 comes out. The movies come both in Blu-Ray and DVD. No complaints about the product or packaging.
B00004XONN|4|Radiohead started the new millenium with this, a fractured twitchy record, that is frighteningly alien (with a post apocalyptic chill) but at the same time warm and tender. <br />The album art says it all, showing a bleached barren landscape overrun with strange \\"evil teddy bears\\". It is Radiohead's definitive artistic statement, self consciously arty and esoteric, but at the same time it was where their sound was headed all along.  <br />Opening with the pulsing keyboards of \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" and ending (after several minutes of silence) with a soundscape of bell like sounds, which builds from what sounds like hundreds of whispering voices (and then more silence). Kid A is an arresting listen, it demands that you hear the whole thing from start to finish. And it's very easy to want to do so.  <br />Some would find it too shocking, indeed, it has been described as nightmarish. But underneath everything the songs are still pure in their intent, and if one concentrates on them, they can create their own story from it. The lyrics are full of confusion, loneliness, anger, and defiance, something Radiohead are known for. The guitars may be gone but Radiohead are still there.  <br />Sonically, the album relies largely on repetition, particularly the bassline of the terrific \\"The National Anthem\\" and the beats scattered throughout the album are something to marvel at, sparse and metallic, but oh so listenable. The album also takes in styles not covered before by Radiohead such as electronic music in \\"Ideoteque\\", an abstract and very thin (and also the most vocal centred song on the album) ode to what seems to be human sin and ignorance. <br />Kid A is a hard record to love, but a rewarding experience is one can find the way in. It is a transcendant piece of music that should not be taken lightly.

B00008WT5C|5|Growing up on the Beatles and classical music in grammar school, I befriended some kids who were the tough kids. We all liked various rock 'n roll bands. One kid pulled out a cassette tape and stuck it in a portable stereo in the park one day. I heard Bad Boy Boogie for the first time. The Bon growl of lyrics,\\"I do the bad boy boogie all over town\\" immediately proved along with the tone and rythm of guitar, bass, and drums, hit me as a type of rock I'd never heard. It made me want it, but knew my parents would be outraged as a 5th grade kid listening to such delinquency. Lol. The fan affair began. No other band can compare with AC/DC. They are in a class all their own. They aren't a metal band. They are maximum rock and roll particular to the raw energy of Malcolm, Angus, Phil, Mark (on High Voltage), Williams, Bon (RIP), and Brian after Scott. No other group could do it like they did. One of the few bands I can say never lets you down when you buy any of their albums. Let There Be Rock was just the beginning for me.
B00JP5GRVM|5|Loved the story and this is one Ben Stiller movie where he didnt annoy me.
0446691437|2|Steven Pressfield is clearly experienced in the \\"war of art\\".  In many parts of this book, he hits the nail on the head and describes \\"Resistance\\" (his dark personification of procrastination etc.) in vivid detail.  I'm sure many readers will identify intimately with the topics touched upon. <br /> <br />The book is divided into three parts, describing things that inhibit us from being creative, how to overcome them and, finally, those things that inspire us.  The first section is well written, although overly verbose -- I think one could almost read the chapter headings and be done with it.  Nonetheless, he certainly touches on a couple of very important points.  From there onward, the book begins to deteriorate steadily.  The second section is bearable (it even has a few gems here and there), but the third falters completely in my opinion, and in many words says very little (even managing to fall flat around the very interesting dream of Largo). <br /> <br />It's a pity, since I think this book could have been great.  As it stands, it is not.
B003730LRY|5|Love this movie.
B00B5P37IG|1|Mostly religious channels and some off brand news channels. Waste of $!!!.  There are no ABC, CBS, NBC, fox, bravo, CNN, history or any other known channels you would expect from a TV app.  Plus there is no preview of channels until you buy it.
B0000032LS|5|This is REAL FUN. If at least once,you was present in a full packed theater,   with Frank N' Furter style dressed people screaming to death I'M A SWEET TRANSVESTITE!!   and throwing Rice and water and all the ritual supposed to be done along the screening.  Then, this experience return to You, every single time you play this record,(that still stand by itself in terms of music).  If you did not participate of this event, hardly will understand why some people do make a cult out of it.  I personally do not enjoy massive concerts or cultural events. But this case is a very different thing.  I don't have information for this continuing to be screened as it used to be in many countries for every week end,   and even less with the screaming crowd going to do the show, but if you find it. GO!   And then buy the record. It will be very hard when you play it not to sing along and wish to get free jumping and dancing.  I was extremely young those days, but hope people nowadays could be naive enough to do it again and enjoy so much as it used to be.
B0000062GK|4|I just gave Crystal Planet another listen and I don't know why I let it collect dust since I bought it last year.  Been a Satriani fan since &quot;Surfing...&quot; and pretty much felt Surfing was the prototypical, definitive Satriani love fest.  Well... I'm enjoying  the heck out of Crystal right now and would have to say it's right up there behind Surfing,  and better than everything else (wow, do I really mean that?).  Gems are the title song, and, well actually the first half of the CD is fantastic.. (entering the 2nd half as I type this - been a while :).  One difference here is that it sounds more like a band (the drumming is fantastic) as opposed to just Joe in a studio with a drum machine.  It's a bit more upbeat than the others; fast and multi-directional.  You gotta love these new chord directions he takes us.  So... if you're a fan (or even if you're not), what can I say.. it's worth it! Surfing would have to be a &quot;5&quot; - sorry.
B00FATEJYE|5|this is by far the best game my three kids love to play, they are 5,6,8 yeas old and all of them love it.<br />wide range of characters , every one so different , great tasks and easy to use.<br />very simple to play, graphic is amazing.<br />your kids are going to love it!!!!!

B002UXRH10|4|Rihanna's 2009 and fourth effort, \\"Rated R,\\" is the best album of her career and one of the best albums of the year. Why? This album dares to be different from the masses and previous Rihanna efforts, as she presents herself with more edge, sexier, daring, and more truthful than ever before.   The album starts with a small interlude titled \\"Mad House,\\" which really does a good job of setting the album's tone. \\"Wait Your Turn\\" is the first song on the album and it gets the listener vibing quickly. Rihanna gives no time for breath, as the album turns to \\"Hard\\" feat. Young Jeezy, followed by \\"Stupid In Love.\\" All of the tracks are creative, outgoing, and some of her best work. \\"Rockstar 101\\" is a bit corny, but the albums picks up again with the lead single \\"Russian Roulette.\\" The rest of the album continues like the first half, as all the songs present themselve with an edge and passion.   Rihanna really sheds her pop image with this album, as majority of the songs have a hard rock edge about them, with the exception of a few tracks. She's also cursing, as well as proudly presenting her bold personality and sexuality throughout the album's lyrics, and liner notes.   In my opinion, this is Rihanna's best album and one of the best albums I've heard this year. She took artistic chances with \\"Rated R,\\" changing her whole persona and agenda. This album seems more truthful than her previous three efforts.   Rihanna fans may not like this album if they're looking for her bubble-gum/pop albums of the past. She's definitely grown as a person and as an artist with this record. If you're wanting to hear a good album and have no preconceived notions going into it, buy \\"Rated R.\\"
B000I2IT44|5|It's a pleasure to watch & listen to this concert & bonus stuff, each time I play it. Considering it's PT's 1st official DVD release, I'm sure they'll continue to put out some really good stuff on DVD in the near future. This is only the start of something really good, although I wish they hadn't become so widely known, compared to back in the '90s. There is a lot of material missing from \\"Arriving Somewhere...\\" setlist, and I don't understand why it was omitted (Shesmovedon, Deadwing, Radioactive Toy). The question that comes up in my mind is: \\"Why release a DVD from the \\"Deadwing\\" tour and not put the title track on?\\"<br /><br />Sound quality is excellent, although they could've shown more of SW and the band. Personally, I think they honed in on the audience too much, and one of the cameramen went as far as zooming in pretty close on some salt-pepper bear-ish guy in the front row. PT are a fantastic band, but we need to see more of Steven Wilson & the band members...and not some shy & out-of-place audience member. Finally, the guy appeared rather uncomfortable, knowing he was in the spotlight on camera. Picture quality wasn't too great at times, and there were lots of grainy shots here & there. Also, I found it distracting when the picture would go from grainy to clear (in color) to black & white and back to grainy color & clear again (in color). I know this was done on purpose, but come on, it was quite distracting. What i did like were the closeups (not only of SW's face, but the band & instruments as well). Being a huge fan of the mellotron & keyboard arrangements in music (generally), I enjoyed seeing those zoomed in shots.<br /><br />I've been a loyal fan of PT since '99, when I first heard the Stupid Dream CD playing in a local music store. Since then, I've bought nearly everything PT have released. Having seen PT three times in Montreal (in person).....twice for In Absentia and once for Deadwing, I've come to realize it's far better to experience PT live and then watch this DVD, than to watch the DVD without first experiencing a live PT show in person. Given the songs the setlist is lacking, I'm a tad disappointed. But, like I said, the sound quality is superior and I appreciate owning the item. We pre-ordered ours from Burningshed too, but ours isn't one of the limited edition with postcards & number (a minor error), although we were among the 2000 who pre-ordered. Nevertheless, am still happy to own the item and will watch it from time to time without wearing it out. ;-) All the bonus features are super and have by far, met my expectations.

B00KK0PICK|5|The author's perspective on getting rid of clutter is that you should not keep anything that you don't love and does not make you joyous inside.  I had difficulty with the concept when going through my socks and underwear (I don't love any of them, they serve a purpose), but it made it easier to get rid of perfectly good things that I really didn't like (I donated or sold them).  I got rid of many bags of stuff accumulated over many years, and it was freeing.  The philosophy of not to have anything you don't love can't be applied to everything (some things you just need), but it has helped me to stop over-shopping and to get rid of a lot of stuff that was just taking up space.  I actually thanked something I bought and didn't use before giving it away, and it did lessen my guilt.  Of course, not all her advice translates to bigger American homes and American sensibilities, but the overall structure of her advice was very beneficial to me.
B00F7YHDWC|5|Great game to.play after work or before work. I like the different little games only if it had some hit to different characters.
B00DPM7TIG|5|So well written and truly memorable.  Story line, structure and set-up kept me glued.
B00957T6X6|3|Don't get me wrong i'm loving the series and the price is great but it is sent to you as one file. So instead of getting 5 seperate files for each book its one massive block so it's hard to know exactly where you are in each book. Also not so fun moment when for some reason my kindle restarted me from the beginning and I had to try to find my spot.
0784011796|4|Pi is one of the better independent low-budget films I've seen in the last couple of years. It's a strange, twisted, subversive film, which takes as its thesis the idea that it's possible to know too much, to ask too many questions, for one's own good. A good example is the troubled protagonist of Pi, played to chilling perfection by Sean Gullette, who struggles with both the outside world and himself in his quest for the ultimate knowledge -- an equation which will tie together everything, from the beginnings of the universe to the chaotic ups and downs of the stock market. He is spied upon by unnamed big business interests, hoping to cash in on the latter idea; he is spied upon by Hasidic Jews who hope to cash in on the former idea; both sets of spies add the perfect element of paranoia to the film, and convince you that there is far more going on here than meets the eye, far more going on than is being talked about. The ideas put forth in later scenes bear this out -- boy, do they! -- but I wouldn't want to spoil that for you. The events of Pi, especially in the later scenes, are so surprising that any discussion of the plot would be totally unfair -- like telling someone who hasn't seen Citizen Kane what Rosebud is. So instead I'll confine myself to theme and character, which are sort of intertwined in this film. Gullette's character is a genius mathematician (as you might expect), a child prodigy of sorts who has always, we are told by his narration, courted such dangerous ideas and notions...and has paid the price for his arrogance more than once. He suffers from migranes -- really serious, agonizing ones which give him nosebleeds and vicious hallucinations, and which no painkillers seem able to stop or tame. (In fact the depictions of the migranes are amongst the film's best sequences; I watched it with a friend of mine who suffers from such headaches, and he said that these scenes were pretty close to what he experienced, at least in the feeling those scenesevoked.) It is during or just after the onset of these migranes that Gullette's character seems to receive his greatest revelations and insights -- and here the filmmakers use a technique of showing bright light as the literal image of these insights, a bit of symbolism that is almost, but not quite, clumsy and overdone. I believe it's by their sheer conviction that it works that the filmmakers are able to pull it off at all. In fact, it's through the use of this symbolism (light=knowledge) that Pi does some of its best work. It's used to illustrate the thesis I mentioned earlier, that it's possible to want to know too much for one's own good; Gullette's character relates how as a child, he stared too long into the sun, possibly triggering his migranes and his gift for numbers at the same time...which is why both seem intertwined in his perceptions. The use of light in the migrane sequences, and Gullette's subsequent gifts of insight, not only are symbolic but provide foreshadowing -- is he staring into the sun again? If so, what damage will he do this time? And as the plot slowly reveals where it is going, those questions become not only more difficult to answer, but more unsettling to even ask.<br />Pi was shot in black and white, which I find entirely appropriate. The harsh images created by the cinematography are a perfect echo for the harsh story, spoken in a language of such harsh rhythms...like the song a puppet sings when it siezes the strings of its own puppeteer. It may take more than one viewing to get everything out of this film, because there's a lot packed into it...but the more you watch it, the more rewarding it is. I would heartily reccommend Pi to any lover of experimental film.
B00005V1WO|4|Legend says Mary Shelley conceived of the idea for Frankenstein after a weekend at Lord Byron's estate and this film is a fictionalized version of that weekend.

B00GLX1MG6|5|Never get tired of watching this movie. SUPER FUNNY. Mildly inappropriate for kids, but really funny if just adults are watching it.
0812993845|2|I haven't read the shopaholics series in a while or other earlier works like the Undomestic Goddess or Remember Me by the same author, but I do recall enjoying them quite a bit and found the heroines enchanting.  I don't know if over the years, my taste for chicklit has changed or this was simply an over the top, farcical comedy.<br /><br />I'm not even sure what to write since the negative reviews pretty much capture my thoughts, but the story follows two sisters, Lottie, who I found ridiculous, and Fliss, the slightly less ridiculous, who get caught in cliche after cliche of madcap antics.  It went downhill in the very beginning pages when Fliss anticipates a wedding proposal from her boyfriend of three years, buys herself an engagement ring and then finds our her boyfriend has no intention of proposing.  Of course it's public and humiliating because she makes it public and humiliating.  Normally the heroines in these books are quirky but have redeeming qualities and good hearts where it counts, but I didn't really care for either one and they both just came off as crazy and desperate.  Even the happily ever after was off since the book focused on the antics more than the love.  Overall the whole thing unfolded like a bad romantic comedy.  If you're a fan of heroines who do stupid things and get caught in them, then give it a try.  If you're looking for even a modicum of reality, then I would have to say skip it.
B0015HOFZI|4|For your basic tuntable, it has done well. It was easy to set up and was ready to go in a matter of minutes.  I did have to use an older amp/reciever for the hookups.I perfer using the rca plugs rather than the USB connecter.  This turntable is perfect for first time listeners as well as oldtime users like myself.  The packaging was welldone, I must admit it was well protected.
B005974CNA|5|I've read multiple reviews of this album before listening and found none very helpful. Don't listen to these over analylitical people over state their disappointment. The only draw back to me, which doesn't really affect my opinion of sound; This album is a tad less drum driven, more instrument driven. What I expected because Mike Portnoy is a much better drummer in my opinion. Don't believe me? What has mangini done that can over shaddow what Portnoy has done? NOTHING! None the less, this album is great! Don't listen to what people say, just listen to the album and judge yourself.

B004FOA84A|4|I downloaded The lost city when it was free, and I loved it. (It wasn't too short, but I wouldn't of been dissapointed if it had been longer.) I read the reviews for The secret of Grisly manor, and seeing it was made by the same people as The lost city, I bought it for $0.99. I had read reviews, and some people said it was very short, and I figured it would be as long as the other one (Which took me about a week). I was very wrong..I could've finished it in half an hour.<br />So I gave The secret of Grisly Manor 4 stars, because I was dissapointed in the length. (In my opinion. it should be free - it wasn't long enough to be worth even a dollar.)<br /> If you're going to purchase one, purchase The lost city - you won't be dissapointed!
B009LMTDL0|5|Inspiring, encouraging and just great. I highly recommended especially for women who want to pursue a career and even for those who would like to be stay at home moms.

B00CAJP0ZO|2|Usually I'd spend time writing a well thought out review.  But, I feel cheated by having a not-so-well thought out album.  With all the negative reviews, I listened to this album in its entirety on another site. I will admit that \\"Scream & Shout\\" with 'Britney, Bitch' is catchy if not lacking in lyrics.  And it saves the album from being 1-star, but only by a thread. I am a person who enjoys good, meaningful lyrics, but my guilty pleasure is the often lacking-in-lyrical-department pop that is catchy and keeps me moving.  And with this album, there is potential.  So much potential, especially with \\"Good Times Are Coming\\" and \\"World Is Crazy\\". Perhaps weaved into this is my bias that he had to resort to collaborating with Bieber and even worse, Chris Brown. However, this album leaves me feeling used and taken advantage of.  I like the artist, and I won't divulge in the musical plagiarism debate that other reviewers are discussing because I can't get over the abundant use of auto-tune.  I'm sick of it. Where Is The Talent (Elephunk reference)? I'll wait for this to go on sale dramatically (more so than $5) before I'll consider purchasing.  #willpower, in my eyes = #willfail.
B00FKF0F3C|3|This third book of the trilogy did not measure up to the first two offerings. This third book didn't even come close to the first two. It was too confusing with too many characters popping in and out of the story. After a while, it became a struggle to try to remember who was who's parent or child or lover or whatever. It just became a grim resolve to hang on till the end. I did really enjoy learning the many details of the actual historical events throughout the last century. I was very disappointed in Ken Follett's writing in this book. I know he is capable of better writing  because I have read most if not all his books over the years.  He owes his fans an apology for this one.
B0069UP2PI|4|An okay story, but I still prefer the older movie &#34;Outbreak.&#34;
B0058Z4NR8|5|The perspective of how the world has reached it's current status and why some countries are able to grow and thrive while others are condemned to misery changes dramatically after reading this book.  As a Costa Rican, I can clearly extrapolate their conclusions to my country and why we have reached our current situation. This is a must read for anyone that wants to better understand how to implement sound development policies in a country.  The authors need a good editor since the book is very repetitive. That said, this reading is worth every minute.
B00J2PEU3W|4|Ithink sometimes we analyze things almost too much but this movie was tender and well thought out.  Emma Thompson was extraordinary in her role as well as was th rest ogv the cast.  I grew up with Walt Disney as a child so this might be too much of a generational thing to be appreciated by a younger audience but Tom Hanks brought a certain appreciation of his character that allowed you to see what his game play was for the portrayal - a fine actor.  I enjoyed the movie and can easily recommend.

It is not a how-to guide, and I would probably lose my money if I tried to copy his examples. <BR>His advice on the rules of the game, how to view assets and liabilities, and the importance of financial literacy are necessary for the traditional &quot;work-hard and save&quot; crowd.<BR>However, a college education can be an advantage for anyone.

125000098X|4|True to form Archer. I was under the impression that this was the third and<br />last in a series. However, the ending leaves unanswered issues indicating<br />there must be a fourth in the series.<br />  R. Carman
B004VFYNRQ|3|great
B00I75EROU|5|Great  book easy read
B00CDXOPYE|5|This movie was so good and the ending was a super surprise i never saw coming.  I loved it so much!!
B003VANOFY|5|I think this is one of the best headsets on the market! Battery lasts a long time, great sound, great mic & it's around the ears instead of pressing on the ears.
B003TSEL7S|5|So interesting!
B000BISBDY|5|Never get tired of hearing a Cash song.  This is a great CD. Thank You very much.  ariived quickley and price was super!

0714843377|5|good short read
B0028IDXDS|4|It's worth the money. My son wouldn't take any of the other pacifiers especially the ones made of silicon. It's adorable and he started grabbing for the toy by 3 months old! love it.
B001GXTXTO|5|Wandering around at Seattle's Bumbershoot festival in, was it 2005?... I heard a band playing that sounded for all the world like Cream with a vocalist that could only have been an elderly black blues man. Imagine my surprise when I turned the corner and saw two young skinny white guys cranking out classic sounds with tons and tons of soul, grit, and real feeling. I stood transfixed as the crowd swayed rhythmically to that slow drumbeat and dirty, crunchy, amazingly rich guitar, and the Black Keys just blew us all away. I immediately bought a Thickfreakness CD from a table near the stage and have been amazed at these guys ever since. Love, love, love the Black Keys.
B0049P1VHS|5|What a refreshing and entertaining show.  Special effects are exceptional, and the interpersonal relationships create balance and relief between well placed scenes of mayhem.  A little too realistic for some people, especially children, but well made and realistic enough to keep the viewers' belief that anything can happen next.  Nobody is safe from the gross and agressive walkers.
B00A6PD9I4|5|The princess of a clan has to marry a prince from another clan. She doesn't want to so she tries to find a way to change her destiny. Unfortunately, it backfires on her in the worst way and puts her mother's life in danger. My teenage sons and I enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5|This is the best game ever I really don't hate it so more more more more more more 5 stars
B00G3P6VA4|5|I watch all MD's stuff and like 99% of his work but THIS movie raised the bar to a whole new level for him.  He's another one of those actors that can do anything, he can become anyone he wants to be right before your eyes.  The whole cast was Great!!  The Graphics could not have been any better.  The message in the movie may not be too far off target either which is a very scary thought.  The way the &#34;1%&#34; is looting the entire planets economy and leaving the other &#34;99%&#34; to get by with less and less every year it seems.  In my lifetime I've watched the Elite push greed to a whole new level.  Give them another 50 more years of what they've done to all of us the last 50 and they might have their own &#34;Elysium&#34; and the rest will be left here on Earth with what's left.  ( Those are just my own thoughts at the end but this movie made me see just how possible it would be.)
B00E8KLWB4|4|I just enjoy finding things in these kinds of games.
B004HWYTP4|3|It is a spoof and its good fun and great cast.  He's Bruce all the way with his it in this one.
B00000F1D3|5|She's a key player in the generation that created the &quot;cool&quot;  kids today think is their own. She's done it all along the way and always stayed right on top of what was hot...whether what was &quot;hot&quot; was  new or not. Limited voice? Plastic bodied? Too old?  I bought my first Cher  song in 1965 and my most current in 2000. She sounds as powerful and fun as  she did 35 years ago. Let's see how many of you are still buying Celine and  Fastball and any Britney NEW RELEASES in 2035. Take a look at any photos of  Sonny and Cher circa 1966 and tell me what cool looks like in 2000. To  trash this incredible force as dated is like calling electricity a quaint  idea. Like any great artist, she owes us nothing but gives us her all  anyway.Thanks for this latest gift Cher!
B00G6ZTM3Y|4|This game is fun but the update makes it a bit laggy. Plus I had 2 worlds my favourite one and a hunting one. In my hunting one I went to delete it and it deleted my favourite one instead! Everything I worked on is gone now! Even all 46 of my rare gold coins!
B00DJWV11I|5|This book doesn't disappoint. This author did her research because it really felt like I was inside the male mind. Drew reminded me of my husband in so many ways I was cracking up.<br /><br />Chase puts a twist on the traditional romance of alpha male meets and falls for a career-driven smart female. Of course he doesn't know how to deal with such emotions and mistakes ensue.<br /><br />Great writing, awesome characterization, this book is a hands down winner.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|IThis game is alot like flappy birds but i can only find this so i love it. And play ict every single day.  Ou  California lnly<br />.
B0053O89WY|5|Great show, something my grandfather, mom, girlfriend and I can all enjoy. I try not to miss an episode but always get the season just in case.
B00628RVV0|5|Makes you think.
0439023521|5|Saw the preview and decided to read them before the movie came out. Loved it! I highly recommend it! You will want all three.
B00CCXL9OE|5|Starting our massive movie collection, and this is a great addition to add to the collection. Looking forward to ordering more.
B005QBKXOQ|5|His 3rd CD, and he still rocks.  Love it.  We own all 3.  Hard to believe he finished 3rd in American Idol, but I have more of his CD's than the other Idol's combined.
B00AREIAI8|5|Feels like i have a real horse, its very addicting also and the games i ncluded in the horse care is also very nice
B0073LWEXK|2|While the app worked without any problems on my Kindle HDX, that was the best part of the experience. The puzzles are simple and lack any thought or logic on the players part. Navigating the island is unintuitive and confusing, but you'll memorize it quickly because of how small it is. The low resolution is unfortunate, as it seems like much of the games appeal lies in exploring a magical island.
B00RNRDACS|4|Not bad. Definitely heavy punch to North Korea's face.
B003477DVK|5|It was a warm family entertaining film.  I would highly recommend this film.  we need more of these. thank you
B0074D3CAQ|5|Totally enjoyed this &#34;journey&#34; book.
B009FZHYKU|4|Definitely still enjoying this show.  Really dislike the Govenor character, hope we see the end of him shortly.  Can't wait to see what happens next
0099527561|5|This is the best one yet. I have read them all and it has twists throughout the book, keeps your interest and purchasing through Amazon was the answer.
0307388921|2|I just did not get the point of this book?  I could not tell if it was just a weird tale about a guy with all kinds of problems and hang ups, or whether there was some point to it all.  It was entertaining--especially the parts about his escapades--I will give it that, but it  left me wondering what the hell was that I just read. I thought it would come to some sort of conclusion,  but it did not.  If his other books are like this, I don't believe I am going to read them.
B00PT3AUYO|5|In a year with quite of few well executed films. Whiplash, for me, was the best of them. Simply put, if you've ever tried to succeed at something. To achieve greatness in anything at all. This film is for you.
B005XQLBU4|5|Fun game to play
B004V6MWFU|4|I was very circumspect about listening to an entire album of music where the ukulele was the only instrument to back up his vocals, but I can assure you, it's all he needs.  These songs are achingly beautiful, and for those of you who are Pearl Jam fans (I'm one), they open up a whole new side to this multi-faceted talent.
B0074QGGK6|4|I must read for any creative - Experienced and new...
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game sounds like a kids game, but many adults are addicted to it, as it challenges the mind. . .  I play whenever I have the opportunity and when it frustrates, as it is apt to do, I put it down for a while. . .
B00GOZQ2E8|4|Just started playing.I've really enjoyed it so far.I love the hero's and the ability too upgrade.no complaints at all.good work!
0307236722|5|Love it! All the recipes from the PBS series &#34;Martha Bakes&#34;!
B00H8C4HZ2|5|Im a Forest Whittaker fan so I thought his performance was awesome.  Oprah did her her thing in this movie. I enjoyed her performance as well.  Lenny Kravitz, Cuba Gooding,  Mariah Carey, Terrence Howard, they all did excellent jobs.. I watch this movie and 12 yrs a Slave the same night. I love this movie more. Its a good movie night movie.
B00005JLXE|2|SPOILER<BR>though i never saw the daredevil comic book so i cannot relate it to the movie, this movie SUCKED. it was also kinda sad because of jennifer garner dying so early in the movie and all... ben affleck is a really bad actor, wow, boy oh boy does he suck. the only performance i liked here was colin farrell as bullseye. he's plays the villian very well. the plot wasn't too deep and i don't remember this being a summer popcorn movie... well, this movie was very bad and i don't recomend it to anybody.
B004MC8CA2|5|With the advent of so much technology, the odds of people who don't know about God picking up a  Bible seems low. Having an app like this is a great way of keeping the Bible accessible, and a way to reach those who may not know god otherwise.
B00H3GZMIE|5|Just love his music what more can one say... I would recommend
B002C6K7N0|5|1 Production way better than Metallica, by far.  2 Solo's better than Kirk!  3 Old school style the same.  4 Lyrics equal.  5 Progressive nature, close!  6 Toss up!  Great job Dave, I wish it didn't take Metallica to motivate you to write a kickass cd!
B00P7PJ9P0|3|Not bad but I like Angelina's dark side :)
B004X80QNG|5|I was impressed at first but... Firstly after two months of information went on - as well as another 3 months forward, I received the following error:  \\"Sorry - The application Pocket INformant (process net.webis.pocketinformant) has stopped unexpectedly.  Please try again. Force Close\\"  In addition I noticed that they updated recently to enable us to use the Address Book on the Kindle Fire but everytime I try to access the address book I would also get an error.  I emailed the support yesterday and their response is that they will have version 2.03 available in the Amazon App Store soon.  That is not good enough - I use this to track my appointments for my business on my Kindle Fire, now I am forced to source another software and replug all that information again.  I want back my money<br /><br />Since contacting the developers I have gotten a newer version that Rocks!!  So now I would upgrade my vote to 5 stars
B001NHNG64|4|Another Lee Childs wonder
B008Y6RGFE|5|This is a funny, entertaining movie about relationships.
B0009P5YXO|4|First things first, this came a whole day early before 'estimate delivery' date. I was like a child on christmas morning when I got this in the mail. I love it. And it has been realky fun! You DO need a screwdriver to open the battery compartment on your sonic screwdriver. Which in itself is ironic and funny.<br />It does not look EXACTLY like 9&10's screwdriver but its pretty close. It also bigger than I imagined but in the description it does say its dimensions, so I'm not upset about that. The only thing is that my pen tip doesnt fit as tightly as the uv ink pen does. Its slightly loose and when i try to take the cap off to use the pen, the whole thing come out. Which is slightly annoying. But really other than that this toy has been so much fun! The noise it great! I love this toy more than I probably should, being an \\"adult\\" and all! I just can't help it. Its been great. And I will definitely be buying the 11th's and river song's screwdrivers in the future!  Thank you!
034580404X|4|The first two books are the best, the last one is very far fetched. These books aren't what people think the story is about, It is really a love story
B000QCS8TW|5|The hubs and I really enjoy watching Game of Thrones, but I absolutely love reading the books. George R.R. Martin is an amazing writer. He's one of the few authors of epic stories that can truly paint a picture with words. Each voice is its own. You won't be disappointed!
B007C4ZJ3K|2|I feel I have pretty low expectations for being entertained by movies liking many that others find \\"boring\\", but this one was just uninteresting.  I found myself wanting to turn it off after the first 30mins, but decided to sit through it and found myself just picking it apart instead of being entertained...  Just a poor re-enactment of an over used plot.
B00PEVD59I|3|Too many nags and you have to write too many words with the tiny kindle keyboard. Partly Amazon's fault that.
0525478817|3|As a 40 year old male, I'm not ashamed to admit I like John Green's books.  In each he seems to capture the essence of adolescence that remains with us into adulthood.  In my favorite book, An Abundance of Katherines, Green expertly captures the struggles of a gifted teen in ways that speak to what it is like to be a gifted adult.<br /><br />It The Fault in Our Stars, Green takes on teenagers facing terminal cancer.  Hazel Grace Lancaster is a teen living on borrowed time, with lung cancer and only a short time to live.  She meets Augustin \\"Gus\\" Waters, a cancer survivor, at a support group and soon they fall in love.  They bond over Hazel's favorite book,  \\"An Imperial Affliction\\", by the fictional Peter Van Houten.  The book tells the story of a girl with cancer and ends suddenly when the girl dies, and both Hazel and Gus long to learn what happens next.  As their romance blossoms, they conspire to meet Peter Van Houten, who lives in the Netherlands.<br /><br />While I cannot speak with experience, Green seems to expertly capture the feelings of children with cancer, who are strong not because of some great inner power, but because they have no other choice.  Gus and Hazel, and Gus's friend Issac all have authentic voices and relationships with their parents that feel true.  There are many times when Green, with a few lines of dialogue, brings tears to your eyes by simply detailing the words kids and parents exchange when faced with such terrible fates.<br /><br />Where the book falls short to me Peter Van Houten.  On the page, he never seems more than a plot device to hinge the book on.  While they help set up some wonderful sequences is Holland, the interaction with the character himself seems false, and only a way to setup the twist in the middle of the book and an ending that, without spoiling it, seems overwritten and false.<br /><br />Still, Green has a wonderful way of capturing the mindset of certain types of teenagers that feels timeless.  The Fault In Our Stars is worth the read.  Just bring a tissue.ring a tissue.
B004SUWR2C|1|game extends beyond the size of my screen, cannot play at all :  Maybe this will get fixed in a update, i hope, soon.
B002WJI658|2|Kind of disappointed. Got a lot of other plush toys for my son this one by far doesn't measure up.
B00FVVR2ZO|5|I really enjoy this game. I do wish you could get more prizes when you banish a criminal. Everything seems a little pricey especially when trying to complete a task. But overall a great game.
B00004Y6OA|4|At first I was skeptical about this 3rd album by the godly Van Halen because it is one of the overlooked albums, but it is also the most underrated. I would rate this the 3rd best Van Halen album. Michael Anthony was at the top of his game, It was arguably DLR's best performance, Eddie was still on top of it, and it had remarkable work by Alex. \\"And The Cradle Will Rock\\" is a popular song from the album but I personally don't think it's that great of a song. \\"Romeo Delight\\" is the hardest, and pretty close to the best song i've ever heard. It's hard, fast, has catchy lyrics, and the ending riff blew me away. This is the best work Michael Anthony ever did on bass, and one of the best Alex did on the drums. The lead in song \\"Tora! Tora!\\" is good but they could of added it to \\"Loss of Control\\", or just not put it in at all. \\"Loss of Control\\" is another of the good songs and the second best in my oppinion. \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\" is like a funny version of \\"Ice Cream Man\\" off of VH1 it begins with Dave on the acoustic, and it has funny lyrics, and he hiccups while singing the song.<br />If your into harder songs, and your a VH fan, this is definatly the album your looking for. \\"Everybody Wants Some\\", \\"Fools\\", \\"Romeo Delight\\", \\"Loss of Control\\", and the killer finisher \\"In A Simple Rhyme\\" are all good songs and any one of those songs alone are worth the money. This is the most underated album, but I can't see why. It is a must have for any Van Halen fan.

B00QW8TYWO|3|Great game
B0054JZC6E|5|it is fun. some games are challenging and you don't get bored easy. I would recommend this game to friends. I love the way you have to earn points to unlock games
B000I3W1XS|5|Compared to todays hi-tech productions, it is a little old-feeling, but still, for the day, it was and is a neat movie. Spock lives!!
B00005JKJA|5|People seem to either LOVE this movie or hate it with a passion. Those who don't like it seem to think that there are countless holes in the plot that are left unfilled. This simply is not true. Every humans views of things are slightly different other humans views. Views become even more twisted over time. Chances are that most of your memories are slightly askew from what the reality was at the time. Betty/Diane came Hollywood expecting it to be everything in her dreams. When she realizes the reality of things she gets torn apart mentally. Thats why she kills her lesbian lover at beginng of the movie(the end chronologically) and it is why here memories of what happened are get so twisted until she shoots herself in the head to kill the demons inside. I can understand someone not liking this movie because of its disturbing nature, but everyone should atleast acknowledge and give credit to director David Lynch because he is certainly smarter than the average movie maker.
0385334206|5|Kurt Vonnegut's novel &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; follows the odyssey of oddball science fiction writer Kilgore Trout from his melancholy childhood in Bermuda, to the sleazy underside of New York City, and eventually to a fateful encounter with car dealer Wayne Hoover, a man &quot;on the brink of going insane.&quot; Within this framework Vonnegut weaves an amazing satiric tapestry that looks at racism, mental illness, environmental crises, the nature and function of art, and many other issues. The book is filled with Vonnegut's own quirky illustrations.<br />&quot;Breakfast&quot; is harsh, even cruel, but also tender and compassionate; it's laugh-out-loud funny, yet haunting and tragic. It's also a reality-warping metaphysical triumph; Vonnegut breaks down the barriers between reality and fiction, and invites the reader into the very process of the novel's creation. He creates a more intimate bond between author, reader, and fictional character than any other writer I can think of.<br />Vonnegut presents some of American literature's most memorable characters in &quot;Breakfast.&quot; But my favorite is undoubtedly Trout. Throughout the book we also get glimpses of Trout's own voluminous body of work, and meet some of his bizarre sci-fi characters. The book as a whole is also enriched by Vonnegut's unique style; he writes as if for an extraterrestrial audience to whom humanity is utterly alien.<br />&quot;Breakfast&quot; is a profane, naughty, yet profoundly spiritual book. Filled with strange and vivid details, it's an oddly comforting modern-day testament for our fractured world. Thanks, Kurt.
B000005TQO|5|Escrevo de Sao Paulo, Brasil para dizer que esse primeiro cd da Laura Pausini, assim como os demais que ela tem  e maravilhoso! Laura e o fenomeno da canao italiana, canta e encanta todos com sua belissima e inigualavel voz. As minhas preferidas musicas desse disco sao La Solitudine, Non C'e e Dove Sei, mas todas as outras sao lindissimas. Recomendo a todos esse cd, que e divido. Vale a pena conferir!
B005D9MUWY|5|this change my life
B005LAIHPE|4|This is one helluvan action-packed flick... once you get past the rather slow-moving beginning.  However, once the action starts, hold on to your seat because it really takes off.  I won't be a spoiler, so I'll just say there are a few scenes that are definitely of the white-knuckle variety.  While some folks may not care for it, I found it to be a riviting movie once it got up to steam.  Yes, do buy it, because it is indeed an action packed flick.
B00J0HCTDK|2|Even though it was some part of history the ending was disappointing. Wish I would have just rented this rather than buy.
B000002HK4|3|Awake was a stunning album. This isn't. Those 7 words pretty much describe A Change of Seasons for me. New boy Derek Sherinian is on keyboards for this album, and he's not a bad keyboardist. The fact is, there is 1 original song on this whole album. The rest is a bunch of covers, and I find that pretty boring. A Change of Seasons, the 24 minute title track is an interesting piece of musical art. It skips around with a lot of musical ideas, and eventually it ends up as a cohesive piece. The classic rock covers really just get boring after a while. I wouldn't recomment this album as a must have.
B0058YPGSY|5|Awesome
0307165485|5|one of the greatest books for ages from 2 to 6. so much to see, excplain and imagine. compatible with the books by shel silverstein for younger kids.<br />one of the most favorite of our grandson, 25 mo old.

B00006RU5B|5|Audioslave is an awesome new band.  when i first heard that the members of rage against the machine with chris cornell as a singer i thought to myself &quot;this is going to be good&quot;.  When i got it i was amazed at how awesome it was. every track is solid. some tracks have a guitar line that sound like RATM but hey what's wrong with that? They can give u hard rocking tracks and also some slower ones.  Highlights are &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;What you are&quot;, &quot;I am the Highway&quot;,&quot; Show me how to live&quot;, and &quot;Bring Em Back Alive&quot;. Here's my rundown of the tracks&quot;:<br />1. Cochise: Their first single, really defines who they are. my 3rd fav...gotta love this song! <BR>2. Show Me How To Live: my favorite track, chris's voice is awesome on the chorus.<BR>3. Gasonline: another great track<BR>4. What you are: awesome track. i'd say my 4th fav on the cd.  Great lyrics with a lot of meaning.<BR>5. Like a Stone: their 2nd single. one of the slower songs on the cd.<BR>6. Set it off: the guitar sounds a bit like RATM on this track.  <BR>7. Shadow of the sun: another excellent track...(there is not one bad track on this cd!)<BR>8. I am the highway: my 2nd favorite. this is a great song. another slower one. deep meaning in the chorus when he sings &quot;i am not your rolling wheels, i am the highway...i am not your carpet ride, i am the sky&quot; i interpret this as him saying &quot;i will not take you, but i will show you the way.&quot;<BR>9. Exploder: good track<BR>10. Hypnotize: a really good one. sounds a little like something soundgarden would do. a little different than the rest of the cd.<BR>11. Bring Em Back Alive: I LOVE THIS TRACK. <BR>12. Light My Way: another one that sounds a little like RATM in the beginning.  awesome, expecially when he screams &quot;Won't you light my way&quot;<BR>13. Getaway Car: another slower track. <BR>14. The Last Remaining Light: good track to end a cd with.<br />That right there is 14 tracks of great music. Best cd in my collection...GET THIS CD...YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
B0086700CM|5|I love this game. Fun game and very addicting. I could not stop playing it. Definately a five star rating.

B003O86FMW|2|I was really into the first book, but Catching Fire really just brought all of the annoyances that were in the back of my mind to the forefront.  Katniss is incredibly frustrating.  For someone who's supposed to be sharp as a tack and a hardcore survivor, she's awfully slow on the uptake.  I found myself frustrated with her as the story progressed because I saw exactly what was going on (side note: the story is too predictable), but she didn't have a clue.  She just didn't make sense to me, and wasn't a very believable person.  Just too overly-dramatic...<br /><br />BTW, what is with the ridiculous \\"inventions\\" of this book?  The suspension of disbelief was thoroughly ruined upon learning about \\"muttations\\" and \\"morphling.\\"  Lame...<br /><br />If you want to read a good dystopian book with some genuine twists and turns, you'd be MUCH better off reading The Giver.  Far superior, in my opinion.
B007N8RULO|5|I love this game it's hard some time but l like the challenge.<br />So time I have to play 10 times before I win but when I do it's great.<br /><br />S
B00IMIJCII|1|The video wasn't right. Half the screen was missing at times. I would give it no stars but 1 is the least you can give.
B000002JSP|5|...with the automatic fire alarm exit!  First off, lets be real honest, punk wasn't that big of a problem in the late 1970's, sure in England it was everywhere, but here in the US Arena rock still had at least 70% of the mainstream music scene.  How many punk albums have sold over 10 million?  Very very few, at the same time the so-called \\"punk explosion\\" happened in 1975-1982, at least 11 hard rock bands released albums that sold in excess of 15 million each, so much for the \\"music of rebellion\\"!  In fact the only Punk album ever to reach the infamous 10 million sold mark was \\"Dookie\\" by Green Day, so punk's impact is very overated.  The only reason why people hype up punk music like it was the huge music scene during the late 70's is because they won't admit that it was in fact the heavy metal scene that came into dominance, because anybody who reads Rolling Stones is an extremely anti-metal music fan and they will use any excuse to dismiss the impact of Van Halen, Judas Priest, Ac/Dc, Aerosmith, and Kiss during the latter part of the 70's.<br /><br />Not that In Through the Outdoor faced an actual threat, Led Zeppelin just thought of a very creative album name with no reason behind it and just to be nice and make retarded musicians like the Sex Pistols and the Clash feel special said they named the album that \\"because the awful noise of the punk scene was too loud for anyone to hear good music.\\"  In fact, the existence of heavy metal music at this time made it easier for Led Zeppelin to 'get through the indoor', so to speak.<br /><br />This album is very underated.  Many casual fans diss this album to death while diehards pratically disown this album.  I understand it is a bit synth heavy at times, but that is because the band were experimenting with a new sound.  If you find this experimentation too weird, then I'm surprised you bought \\"Houses of the Holy\\" and \\"Physical Graffiti\\" which are easily some of the most experimental albums of all time.  Instead this album as it really is: John Paul Jones' baby, a very unique musical direction that is influenced by Jones' wide instrumental background instead of Jimmi Page's experiences while stoned out of his mind.  Besides Jones' songwriting credits, the best songwriting came from Plant, who wrote on all seven of the album's tracks.  I daresay that this is some of his most emotional lyric work, as he just recovered from the death of his son.<br /><br />track listing:<br /><br />1.In the Evening (6:49): The best song on here and one of Led Zeppelin's all-time best.  It is my personal favorite, Jimmi's riffs on here are amazing, it sounds like he plays a series of notes then distorts the last to create an echo effect.  Def Leppard stole this riff for \\"Foolin'\\" and \\"Rock of Ages\\", just in case you are wondering where they got the \\"Zeppelin\\" influence.<br /><br />2.South Bound Saurez (4:17): Melloton heavy track with a jazzy vocal work by Plant.  I don't really remember how this song went, just that it was pretty cool.<br /><br />3.Fool in the Rain (6:12): The other hard rocker on this album, with a lot of synth work.  Has a very latin feel to it and you can hear Page's distinct 'blue box' guitar synthesizer, which has a pretty cool noise to it.<br /><br />4.Hot Dog (3:17): The shortest song on here; I recall it being kind of a rocker with a pretty good guitar solo.<br /><br />5.Carouselramba (10:32): Sounds like carousel music!  This is the highlight of Jones' synthesizer work as it dominates the background over his already played bass part.  I am a little disappointed with the guitar sound, you can barely hear Jimmi Page until later in the song where he uses his infamous double-neck guitar.  The last part of the song is the best where everybody has an allout jam so as to give a festive sound.<br /><br />6.All My Love (5:53): A truely sad song written by Robert Plant for his dead son Karac.  Highlight is Jones' synthesizer solo and Plant's emotional vocals.<br /><br />7.I'm Gonna Crawl (5:30): A return to the blues-roots but a very awkward way to close the album up.  It is a love song which John Bonham noted as one of Robert Plant's best vocal performances.lues-roots but a very awkward way to close the album up.  It is a love song which John Bonham noted as one of Robert Plant's best vocal performances.
B002KAJ0AO|5|Generations to come will still enjoy the Backstreet Boys. My Daughters are the next generation and they ordered this album and are wearing it out! Thank You Amazon and BBS
B0015435OI|4|Granted I would not recommend the whole album to most people since the style of music can be rather long drawn out and boring for most people. However the few stand out tracks i would recommend are The Rip and Magic Doors.<br /><br />When I got the record at first I did not realise that it was a 45rpm and played it at 33.3rpm and it sounded strangely soothing and it seemed even more depressing. However it made me really fall in love with songs like The Rip even more. [...]<br />The fact that someone uploaded it on youtube shows that I might not be the only one who felt that way.
B004UID2LC|5|Great app.  I am very pleased with it and have used it several times.  It was much better than I expected!
B008JMKN4Y|5|This is a great read! I haven't gotten this into a book in a long time. This is definitely a MUST READ!
B00DHSK3RM|5|in order to download it you have to to android drawer and download it from that site..its really easy ..its got the old one up to the new ones..
B004SJ3BCI|5|Free app that my grandson had to have.  I do not have and interest in it, but he stays entertained for long periods of time.
B000JMKQX0|5|As always max Brooks delivers. Great read, and will certainly read it again. If you're looking for a book you won't be able to put down until it's finished, then you've found the right one.
B000022TSY|4|Great for people who are nostalgic for the 60's; even if you wern't alive back then (I wasn't). Great music adds just the right touch to this excellent film.
B00AHSIQWE|3|It was a very entertaining movie, lots of action, Bane was a beast as well. I just couldn't help but giggle at moments of the film. Bale makes an interesting Batman, it's just that that Bat Voice of his got really hilarious at moments in the flim.
B00HV8T1WC|1|Waste of time
1573226521|4|A hot book, fast paced, well-written, words sharper than razor blades, powerful characters, interesting through-out! This book is absolutely fantastic, the character of Richard is described so well, so ALIVE that you just become him - in a way - while reading, even becoming a part of his menacing memories of the Vietnam war.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is, because it takes about 200 pages until something happens, you might call a trigger to later events and there on to the big showdown at the end of the book. The first 200 pages are constructed very well, just like the last, but it kind of just shuffles along, giving us the beach life, the adventure of being stranded on an unknown island. These elements are important to build up a story, but chewed on for too long when it comes to creating the right circumstances for bad things to happen. All I want to say is, that Garland although writing well, had some problems with keeping the story fluid. Put these aside and you got a very thrilling, invloving read, you will remember for a long time - and enjoy much longer, even when you are finished.
044654759X|5|She is a follower of Nicholas Sparks and wanted his latest, we found it on your sight and gave it as a Christmas gift last year
B00AF6MF9I|5|Great game. Lots of fun. Very intense battles. Great for passing the time and this game is one of the best war games I've played.
B0017IKR7K|5|Almost every song on this CD is really good.  I'm glad that it is in my library.
B00BTHWFBK|5|If like old Black Sabbath  then get this cd. It reminds me of the first album, it has that feel
B00A5052YE|5|The cd is very very nice...Alicia keys always delivers never dissapoints. Can't wait to see her in concert this year....exited
B007THA4FI|5|I loved the Harry Potter books and sort of expected not to like her shift in genre. The story line is comletely different but after just a few pages, the characters were completely real and alive and the story engrossing. She has not lost her touch - I came away a true believer in J.K. Rowling's ongoing ability to spin a story !
B0070YDOT8|4|Very well done.  Great graphics and lots of variety in their slots.  Plays like a real casino, which means you won't play very long if you are not buying chips!  It is possible to play for free - they give you a sign-on bonus each day and the potential to pick up a small amount of chips every 30min - but hard if you're a hard-core slotter.  Could work for low-stakes blackjack or poker.<br /><br />They make a big deal about the social &#34;community&#34; and while the rt chat features can be fun, they bring with them the same pro's and con's of any anonymous online interactions.<br /><br />Very passionate user community, and the Facebook page can get sad/scary.  I know this is going to maybe read wrong, but because of the addition of the social networking aspect, this one can be really &#34;sticky&#34;. I would warn you off if I knew you had addiction challenges.
1492977055|3|This is a fun book to color in - I enjoy the little cartoony type animals etc in the book.  I am disappointing in the paper quality - even with a light hand, if you use markers of any kind (I use just the crayola 50 set) the ink bleeds through the paper, so I have to keep a piece of card stock between the pages.  Also, whether I use pencil or marker, the paper being so thin causes the pages to warp etc if you fully color one page.<br /><br />Still a cool book but better paper quality would be MUCH appreciated.
B00LXLM05I|5|It is the best game EVER!
B009KS4XRO|3|This used to be more fun but lately it is almost impossible to 'move on' or complete a section and get all the required rewards.
B00N11MX1Y|5|I purchased this for my husbands 82 birthday, Diana is one of my husbands favorite artist and he has every music cd she has made.
B003O86FMW|5|There is no other series out there so descriptive, and mind riveting as this one. Suzanne Collins is detailed lyrical genius.
B0086700CM|5|It's an awesome game! And I definetly recommened it! I love how you don't have to pay for coins and other stuff!
B00992CF6W|5|I thank mincraft is awesome because you can create something  in your<br />Mind that is just wow<br /><br />E<br />You can remember  . I like how it has blocks  because  I have never seen anything like that
B009E3EY38|5|Make no mistake- rock n roll doesn't get better than this! The audio on this is nothing short of extraordinary. The band give a glimpse of what made them so good in the first place. Some versions are perhaps the best ones available. Jason Bonham really put his heart and soul into this and it shows- a fantastic performance by him. Page, Plant, and Jones are as good as they ever were. This is a must have for any fan of music- without a doubt Zeppelin was one of the greatest bands ever- and this film proves that their music will live forever.
0553296981|5|I first read this when I was about the same age as Anne Frank (13), and was completely enthralled by her story. What is most riveting is that which is between the lines… the hopes, fears, desires, interests… Everything that is mundane becomes a privilege for one living from one day to the next under the terrible fear of being discovered. It was powerful.
B00GNL96H8|5|Awesome I love it ip man was Bruce lee teacher a must see move if your a Bruce lee fan !!!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5|This app has both slot machines and bingo. You kill two birds with one app. I like that this app is more fun because you have a better chance of getting a bingo compared to apps like Bingo Bash. I would recommend this to anyone who likes slots and bingo but is not particular on the slot theme. The only thing that could make it better is that if this app also offered video poker and black jack. I just use this app for the bingo.
0553801473|4|C'mon man, we need the next book. Don't die on us now! I'm finishing up this book for the second time because I'm jonesing for the next and need something to take the edge off. While reading for the second time, I picked up on a lot of detail that I missed on the first go round. Say what you will, but GRRM is the man!
B0049P1ZZQ|5|One of my favorite TV shows. Season 1 is PACKED with tons of extras! Including, a third disc with only extras!! Easy to navigate through the menus and find exactly what you are looking for. If you're not already watching this show, YOU SHOULD BE!! Worth every penny! If you're still reading this you've thought about it too long! Buy the season! You won't regret it!!
B003XTYDMQ|4|I loved the plot, and the quick wit and dialogue was really amusing.  I am sorry that they canceled this.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I enjoy this game alot although i am not a big fan on going on line and sharing the score with others. it is a fun game aside from that. Now i know why it so popular.
B008JFUNYG|5|This is a wonderful movie. It is very horrior and awesome! I enjoyed every moment of it and if you liked the old Evil dead this is worth a watch and even a buy!
B0000669JL|5|This album countains only legendary tracks, it IS the BEST OF Bob Marley, a real pleasure to listen to, a must have for the fans and for the others !
B00005JNEI|5|If you have rated this movie with one star, chances are you haven't even seen it. I have heard countless conservatives talk about the movie and all of it's \\"lies\\", but none have taken the chance to see what they are critisizing. Chances are you also still belive that Iraq has WMDs and was planning to attack.
0312995423|5|I recently started reading Dan Brown's books starting with the Da Vinci Code. I got Digital Fortress for my birthday and I read it in one day. I loved it. I could not put this book down at all.  <br />At first, many parts seemed to be confusing and not make sense. The more I read, the whole puzzle began to fit together. The plot was very interesting and the characters were colorful. <br /> <br />To the other reviewers that thought this book was a total waste of time, that Brown didn't do enough research and thought this was a one or two star book: <br />    1. This book is fiction (not true). Not all the words in this book is going to be true. Including stuff about cryptology and computers.  <br />    2. This is supposed to be a fun novel that takes you through twists and turns. It's not supposed to be the encyclopedia where everything is accurate.  <br />    3. If it's such a predictible book, why did you finish reading it? Some of you even said: I only read it because I wanted to know what happened. <br />    4. For all those computer \\"geniuses\\" who've read this book and thought it was offensive, this book was out in 1998. That's not very new. Some of the \\"facts\\" probably weren't true because of the date.  <br />    5. You guys need to be more open and imaginative. It doesn't have to be perfect and according to everything that's true. <br /> <br />To readers who are looking for a book that keeps you at the edge of your seat, with a plot that twists and turns until the very end, read Digital Fortress.
B0000AQS0F|5|I was a huge Buffy fan, and now I am kicking myself for not catching Firefly when it was on the air. It is well written, both hilarious and touching. The movie, Serenity, is also a great add to a DVD collection. Both were done with care and love from all involved. Long live Mal and Co. Can't stop the signal.
B008HJGPVO|5|I love these especially the multiple tips on this stylus.  These were given as door prizes at a local educational conference and were a big hit.
B00000DOYH|5|When I turned 13, my father gave me Physical Graffiti.  Upon listening to it for the first time, I was thinking that it was the dumbest album I had ever heard.  I didn't want to dissapoint my dad.<BR>      So, as the months went by, I bought Led Zeppelin III, IV and Presence.  I was impressed, so I decided to give Physical Graffiti another try.<BR>     Boy, am I glad I did.  Every song in the album is perfect.  On this CD, you get more of a bluesy feel, especially on the second CD.  <br />DISC 1: 1. Custerd Pie: Great start to the CD. Some great riffs by Page.<BR>        <BR>        2. The Rover: Wow... REALLY great song.  If you walked into my house, you could see me tearing my hair out trying to play it.<BR>        3. In My Time Of Dying: This is my favorite song by Zep (besides Stairway To Heaven).  The guitar solos and riffs by Page are simply amazing.  Bonham shows some of his greatest drumming in this song.  And the lyrics are very neat.<BR>        4. Houses of the Holy: Really catchy song with REALLY catchy riffs.<BR>        5. Trampled Under Foot: One of my favorites on the album.  The keyboards in this song are awesome.  When i played the piano, I tried to learn this.<BR>        6. Kashmir: If i asked my friends if they liked this song, I'd get a whole lot of &quot;THAT SONG SUCKS!!&quot;  Well, i disagree.  This is a wonderful melodic song.<BR>DISC 2  1. In The Light: Slow at first, but once you get into it(which is about two minutes in) it gets really catchy.<BR>        2. Bron-Yr-Aur: Short song, but wonderful acoustic on Page's part.<BR>        3. Down By The Seaside: This was actually one of my favorite songs on the album.  It is very catchy and has great solo in the middle of song.<BR>        4. Ten Years Gone: Wonderful song... good guitar... like most of the songs on the second cd, this song gets catchy further into the song<BR>        5. Night Flight: I really liked this song.  It has a touch of the blues, and still sounds like Zeppelin.<BR>6. The Wanton Song: VERY good song.  Really catchy right from the start.  Makes me wanna get up and dance around.  Plant's voice sounds strange (at least to me)<BR>        7. Boogie With Stu: blues song all the way.  Theres even some great piano.  I love this song just because of the soul in it.  It makes me wanna listen to blues over and over again.<BR>        8. Black Country Woman: good song, but not the best on the cd by far.<BR>        9. Sick Again: Great end to a wonderful cd.  Has some good guitar playing.  Sounds like classic Zep
B004LSJCJM|5|I have only been a Bonamassa fan for a couple of years now.... when I first heard him I was impressed with his versatility as a guitar player. He covered tha gamit of rock and blues and he did it with his own style. With so many Guitar-slingers and SRV wannabe's, I found Joe Bonamassa to be original and sincere, playing some of the greatest classic songs with his own unique blend plus writing some really good songs of his own. My Joe Bonamassa collection has bulked up over the past couple of years, and now he seems to be in a period of creative genius where I find albums rolling out in short due. His collaborations with other artists indicate that Joe is a musician, not just another egotistic \\"Hey. Look at me!\\" guitar player. I saw Joe in Wilmington Delaware last year and he was tremendous. DUST BOWL shows Joe coming into his own. He has developed a sound that is strictly Joe Bonamassa and each album has that stamp that automaticly makes you recognize him. But its not same ole same ole stuff...its fresh and crisp and so very clean. Joe Bonamassa is a winner and every album he has released these past couple years demonstrate his greatness as a musician. If you like this style of Blues/ Rock, you cannot go wrong with any Joe Bonamassa CD.
B009NG1Q96|4|I was very frustrated with the way the events were unfolding yet I couldn't stop reading. I'm looking forward to the next book.
B000005DQR|4|Usually, when I write a review, I don't write in typical fanboy fashion however, this piece of plastic has forced me to do so.    <br /> <br />I don't think there is anymore to be said about this album.  It is, without question, one of the best compact disks in the last 10 years.  If you are a fan of turntablism/Djing and hip-hop in general, you owe it to yourself to purchase this album.  Even if you aren't a fan of the genre, it belongs in your collection.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Fun game for small kids
B00005RY7X|5|My roommate doesn't get this album, but then he is a very unhappy person. If you've ever been passionate about anything: life, love, sex, fun, your dog, a girl, a guy, or even just one singe moment in time, then this albun is the soundtrack to that passion turned up to ten. <BR>If you still don't like this record I hope things work out for you.
B000I9W08I|5|I grew up hearing these song never knowing from where they came. WOW! I was totally astounded! Absolutely power packed musical! It's funny and exciting and such a powerful energetic cast! I have watched it twice just to make sure I didn't miss anything. I watched the credits and to my amazement, the film had been directed by non other than a great dancer in musicals himself Gene Kelly! The beautiful Barbara Streisand at her best and Walter Matthau, ha ha, that man never changes! Also, Michael Crawford, his songs speaks volumes. I'm absolutely blown away with Hello Dolly!<br />Again, WOW WOW WOW!
B008XG1X18|3|I love Pinterest and was excited to download the app on my kindle fire but it seems like the site is always experiencing problems when I try to log on other than that problem I like it.
B000W4RFHK|5|but, if you have dabbled in karma and dharma, it's a good read.  I like the almost stream of consciousness writing.
B00AREIAI8|5|Fun Stuff<br />I enjoy this game. I don't know you so I can't tell you if you will like it
B0099Y2YL6|2|Subtitles are WAY TOO SMALL!!! The subtitles are much smaller than that on the season 1 & 2 special edition set I bought -- even smaller than the ones on the regular TV. It seems ridiculous to spend money on something that I cannot use!
B00B0LPWU6|5|excellent movie, had a very good ending, sent a good message.  Any move with Denzel is a good movie in my book.
B006LSZECO|5|read the book after you see the movie. so much of the book was left out of the movie, and to really get a clear view of how insane this woman is, you need to read the book. Lots of twists. Great book. I read it before the movie, however, so for me, the movie was just lacking so much, it was hard to enjoy it.
B00EEN66SY|1|I expected more in depth background of teens and whether they turned their lives around.  Just about a bunch of kids with no moral compass
B000067FP8|5|Love this movie!!
0143113100|4|Many people think that what we are today is what we will be tomorrow but this book shows scientifically that this isn't necessarily true.  We are truly remarkable beings with the inner power to change our bodies, through the power of intentional positive thinking.  Read about many different real examples where the brain was damaged or sick, but then overcame what seemed to be insurmountable obstacles and changed!    When we believe we have the power to change, we will.  Also the opposite is also true because when we believe we can't change, then guess what - we can't.  As the quote goes, \\"As a man thinketh . . . he is\\" or - as we think, so we are.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This game is very good and challenging for the brain. I recommend this game to everyone that i see because its fun.
0792840461|4|Fun, Colorful, glamorous, cool ... a little dated yes.... but if those fashion/action/montages so popular in 60's and 70's films are out ... why did they invent MTV! This move is cool, period. Characters are chilly and calculating, but fun. Who wouldn't like to be that cunning. McQueen is the epitome of minimal, Dunaway (as always) is both gorgeous and amazing. One of the last real screen divas ... she can go from the most subtle of subtle to soooo over the top! A must have for film buffs.
B000MRAAJM|5|it is an amazing documentary about our planet  wonderful hd pictures !!    it is so relaxing to watch such a beautiful documentary after work !
B00IS87HYI|5|addicting but fun.
B0001I561E|5|First,I bought this movie directly from Amazon, the delivery was faster than expected,perfect packing and original DVD.<br /><br />The movie is wonderful, I think it's one of the best disney movies, lots of  fun, action beautiful animation, sound,  and one of the best aditional features,videos  games and music, simply great, I\\"m Gald I finally got it for my collection
0812416503|4|I loved this book.  I can see how it would be tough for some people to get through, as it was VERY descriptive and not so thrilling at some parts.  However, I became lost in Manderley.  I felt like I was there, like I too, was jealous of the beautiful Rebecca. I was uptight when Mrs. Danvers was mentioned, and I yearned for Mr. De Winter's touch just as the main character did.  Overall, a beautifully written book that is rightfully a classic.
B00PSLQGX6|5|the first 3 seasons were better and I got to see it without commercials which is always a plus. Since the death of Mary's husband it has been a bit dull but I'm hopeful.
B00EXVZZE8|4|Nyan an cat is fun but the music can get annoying. But other than that it is a great game!
B00ADQPB50|5|I buy things I like, why must I give a review on it, I would just rather enjoy my purchase then sit here typing about it, for future reference, I never purchase something I don't like or already know about!!!
B002VPE1WK|5|Great backpack !!! I highly recommend this backpack for anyone thats starting to collect camera equipment.... there is plenty of room
B008M87GJK|5|Seeing the news with different eyes is wonderful!  It is one of the best coverages, adding to one's own perspective.
B007SGM084|4|This is a highly explicit, yet very interesting series.  Total girl porn!  The story is pretty interesting and this is the entire series, so it ends satisfactorily.  I enjoyed it.
B000QRIGLC|5|The first person description of the reality of the 'war on terror' and the people - both our military folk and the natives of other parts of the world - who are caught in the middle is phenomenal.<br />My heart breaks for all of them.
B007VDN1PA|5|Has a bunch of 35 mm negs and slides and wanted to convert to digital.  This did the trick and with great quality.  As noted only really works for 35 mm and would recommend that if you are doing a significant quantity of negs to order additional film holders.  I did over 1000 negs and liked changing the film holder after every 200 or so negs.  Noticed that running the negs through the holders they did score up and could be visible on the scans.  For the money this is a great option to sending negs in for digitizing if you have the time.
B0012QRPU4|4|it's astonishing,sometimes funny,unforgetable, perfect casting,and makes a lasting impression.i had just about given up on tv shows until I stumbled upon this series. congrats.  wrrn2h
B003V4AK8E|3|the controller is good i do like the feel to it. I seem to sweat alot more with this controller than a regular xbox or ps3 controller. the controller has dead zones but its not like it kills your game. if you have small hands do not get this it will be uncomfortable in your hands, mine are just big enough. if you have large hands you will freaking love this controller!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Fun to play and keeps you coming back for more especially when you need something to keep you occupied or are just looking for something fun
B00MU79IL8|5|this is a good one to get.
B00HY7VU60|5|Awesome mini series
B007J4T2G8|5|This book should come with an X rating - but I did enjoy reading it!  I get what all the fuss is about.
B008RA3X5E|5|HAS everything you need in an alarm clock including custom music and easy swipe of the screen to increase or decrease brightness
B00AIUUXHC|1|Ive seen better pornography
B0011Z52EW|4|Gotta love My Chemical Romance! They keep getting better and better! This really is a great song. I totally recommend it.
B005UBNL0A|5|So far i have been running this processor for 2 days. Great speeds. A good upgrading from running a dual core for 3+ years that also still works. AMD makes great processors. I am running this on a gigabyte GA-M68MT-S2 motherboard with 8 gigs of dual channel ddr 3 memory. It is running like a champ. For $109 you cant beat the price for the upgrade.
B00FRQ32N4|3|I had albino but then it stated me all the way over
B00001ODHL|5|One of my favorite films.  Raimi and Bruce Campbell have once again combined bad horror (on purpose for those ignorant to the Evil Dead trilogy) and top notch sarcasm.  You gotta love it.  Ash is back and just  as funny and I love how this movie is much like Evil Dead part 2 but yet  was COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.  What a scenery change and yet there scripts  still work.  Bravo.  Bring us Ash again PLEASE.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Really enjoy finding the hidden pictures, completing the collections, and learning how to get the most out of the game without spending money.
B009HUB40Y|1|TOO MANY ADS ad appears after every game you play just deleted
B00008J4P5|5|Where to go and what to say. Another album of rock,talk and poetry. No wonder people are noticing the babies from Detroit. Just listen to there music. The first two albums were bluesy/rock masterpieces followed by a jolt of imagery and allegories in White Blood Cells. Here we are at a turing point in evolution. This album will be looked back upon as a corner stone of this decade. The stripes have taken all they have learned, threw it back and reinvented a coal burning steel driving machine from the parts. It seems that everyone mentions &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; . This is a great track but look at the first three on the album (see above for track names) The music alone is better than anything out there and I found myself thinking&quot; this is as revolutionary and experimental as the beatles from 67-69. this album: a milestone. Also &quot;little acorns&quot;, great touch with the intro, then a great song. Four albums, and numerous 7&quot; and singles, and all they do is get  better. *eight track reel to reel, nice treat.
B00000I924|5|of all times. Fantastic and tasteful diversity. Jeff Beck takes you on a ride from alternative rock, to blues, to jazz, to new age. And how he makes that strat sound like he is using a dozen effects with his unique style....can ramble on and on.
B008Y6WMEY|5|It's astounding no matter how many times I watch it--hilarious, astringent, truly black--no-one is as coldly brilliant as Kubrick.
B00FATEJYE|3|The game is great but the recharge thing is a pain in the ass. Some can someone please fix that.<br /><br />Thank you :)
B00000DHZJ|5|The man is a legend and this album includes some of his finest work ever. From his brilliant take on Billy Roberts' &quot;Hey Joe&quot; to his definitive use of the wah-wah pedal on &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight  Return)&quot; this is an album of brilliance. Hendrix's influences are  clearly shown on the brilliant &quot;Red House&quot; as he shows he can  write a blues tune to the standard of his heroes and the beautiful  &quot;Angel&quot; shows Jimi at his emotive best. For anyone with music  taste this is a must buy.
B00FPH3YQA|4|Pretty good flick, but not as good as the first one. Almost like they were trying too hard. But still decent
0007513763|4|I bought this as a gift for my niece who is 3 years old. This is definitely not a book she could read herself but one that her parents could read to her.
B00DJFIMW6|4|Love playing with the minions.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Love this game. Keeps my brain sharp.
006019250X|5|If you read one book this year I recommend that you read this. And if you read two books this year I strongly suggest that you read this book twice.
1400049628|4|Overall - very good! This book can help you prepare for any cataclysm, not only a zombie apocalypse. However, I was expecting something more popular and a less formal narration.
B008MEM24S|5|I used to play this on my old phone, and now that I have it on my kindle, it's even better! Well worth the $2.99
B007QA3AH2|5|very funny, it takes outer space to a diff, level old'er movie, but enjoy watching it, from time to time.
B008IJTFYW|5|Nice gently sounds, you can customize by layering, you can also adjust the volume of each one. Also a timer so you can set it to shut off after you're asleep. Perfect.
B00CWY76CC|5|I downloaded this app for my daughter &amp; watching her I became intrigued. Now I can't stop trying to solve my escape. It's really worth playing.
B00VRYCGLO|5|a great game , i enjoyed it very much. walt
B00IRI427Y|5|Very good in Blu-ray, great sound!.
B00GH4RKYM|5|Great movie , loved the action but it would have been better if they did not have so many time gaps in the story line . Could easily have been made into a 2 part sequel to fill in the gaps .
B000000H3W|5|This is a great album. While Beneath the Remains is a tad bit primitive, and Roots is the beginning of their &quot;new style&quot;, I find this album the best. The production is excellent, the lyrics meaningful, and the  musicianship flawless. The album cover is superior also.
B007SYWFRM|5|I love this game so much I could die.I mean o.m.g. I don't. know what to do its like my fav game. ever. it has the best quality ever .
B004SOR4H6|5|I just really like Twitter.
B00BLF9FOK|5|Dirty, gritty, over the top and darkly hilarious. This movie has everything an action movie should have. Schwarzenegger proves yet again why he is the face of the over the top fun. There's gatling guns, 200 mph car chases, gun fights every twenty minutes and down home honest living. By the end of this movie I was literally audible with excitement. The fight scenes will blow you away. We've had to deal with fight scenes that are so close you can't tell what's going on. Not with this movie, the camera work is absolutely perfect. The gore effects of gunshot wounds are actually realistic and the firepower is enough to satisfy any action fan. The dialogue is pretty well done, the story line is simple but perfect for an action flick, the soundtrack is rocking and the stylized cinematography is great.<br /><br />I really can't express how much I loved this movie. Easily one of Schwarzenegger's best and easily one of the best to come out this year.
B004J4WKTW|5|A truly amazing story. It is hard to put into words but I would highly recommend this book. Once I got to the last third of the book I literally couldn't put it down until I had finished it all.
0307454541|1|There were parts of this story that were wonderful. Honestly this is one of the worst books I have ever read. And although if it were written well I would not mind giving it to a teen, since it was not I would not recommend it to anyone.<br />It was a disapointment.
B0071XO8RA|4|This definitely has futurist, dystopian overtones, but there's more meat on the bones here than PKD would have bothered with.  In addition to PKD, I was also reminded at times of Animal Farm.<br /><br />The relationships are nicely drawn.  The opening is really effective. The pace is good.  Somehow, Hugh Howey manages to choose perfectly which parts of the story to explore and which ones to gloss over.  Without spoiling it by saying which is which, I'll just say I'm a grateful reader for his choices.  Overall the story is very engaging.
B001V7SME2|4|Different from other vampire movies in more ways than one. I was pleasantly surprised and will recommend this movie.
1469984202|5|I have never written a review.  However, I loved this book so I felt compelled to write a review so I could get the word out to others.  I enjoy post-apocalyptic fiction.  However, this story isn't as much about survival as it is about humanity.  It is a collection of short novelettes.  But, don't let this dissuade you from reading the Omnibus or each novelette individually.  It reads like one large novel.  I couldn't put the book down.  I could be heard gasping at many shocking and unexpected turns in the book.  Also, I'm an adult but my teenage son also loved the book and has already read the next book in the series \\"First Shift\\".
B00HERGNR6|5|Thor is one of my favorite comic heroes, but this story is convoluted and campy at times. The writers always take license with the story's and change the personalities and origins which makes it frustrating for those of us that know better. That being said, the casting, acting and FX are spot on.
1401207529|5|Where to begin?     The story is deep, engaging, and amazing - probably my favourite of all the Batman graphic novels.     The art is perfect, it is detailed and interesting and the colouring matches the tone of the artwork perfectly.     The lettering is also great, with the different styles matching the narrative of the character well.     I don't understand what this deluxe edition has added to what was a perfect book, other than that - this is an essential purchase.
B001KP2Y3K|4|The album is very easy to listen to with a flow that you won't need to press skip to the next song, which I did sometimes on other people's albums.
B000ICXQUQ|5|I've already seen this movie plenty of times, but I watched it with a friend who's never seen it and he loves it now. It's a classic movie.
1419702238|4|My 9 year old loves this series and has since he was 6 or 7. This a great, read together group of books and fun to together!
B0083SBMBM|5|Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome.  Did I mention it's awesome?  This is easily my favorite of all the Marvel movies to date.  Before this came out I thought \\"How do they plan to use so many main characters and make sure they all get enough screen time and development?\\"  I still don't know how they did it, but they did.  There is no shortage of action, but the humanity of the superheroes is not ignored.  The special effects were great, and I really liked the music.  Mark Ruffalo did an excellent job as Bruce Banner.  I hope he continues to play him in the future.  RDJ was excellent and hilarious as always as Tony Stark.  There were tons of laughs in this movie.  It had comedy, action, suspense, and drama packed into this one movie.  If you didn't see it in theaters, make sure you don't shut it off before the end of the credits.  There are 2 scenes, which you've probably heard about.  One is during the credits, and one is after.  Now prepare for another round of Marvel superhero movies culminating in The Avengers 2.<br /><br />The one negative is that the DVD doesn't have the extended/alternate/deleted scenes or gag reel.  I would have really loved to see them, but I don't have a blu-ray player, so why would I get the DVD/blu-ray combo?
B0063GORYU|5|this is a game for all ages. you need to think but can play slow to teach kids. I find this a great relaxation.
B0066WJLU6|4|Works well
B003F3FJQO|5|I loved this book! I don't know if I liked this book or the first book better. I was completely shocked at the betrayal( if u haven't read it yet then you'll be confused) and I totally understand Thomas and minho's feelings toward Teresa. Over all it was a great book. Very well thought out. I loved the idea of Cranks because it's not what I expected. I do have to say that by the end of the book I felt like Thomas: angry and confused. I'd say that this book is for people of all ages, as long as you like sci-fi. Can't wait to read the next book, which I will do soon!
B000NQRE1E|5|love this movie much better in blu rae, more depth color more definite, the actor s are suberb, this movie is based as close to the real events as ever displayed you will love it
B008JFUO72|4|This is very good, worth buying!  Highly recommend, and I have no regrets on the purchase whatsoever.  Very much so recommend.
B00MELKE0Y|2|I was disappointed in this game.  It was really herky-jerky and sometimes the game wouldn't move at all unless I had one finger on the screen at all times.  I can't recommend it.
B00LDNE3FG|4|Game has slowly grown on me.
B005P1YCNK|5|Take notes, bookmark pages, this book is worth every minute you take in the information! No gimmicks, no outrageous claims, just down to earth advice and counsel. But you have some work to do and because it's in small increments, I dare you to not take hold and get on board!
1439153663|5|As another reviewer stated, I could not put this book down.  The author wrote an amazing story.  It was heartbreaking, bleak and just beautiful at the same time.   One of the best books I have read in a long time, I eagerly await her next story.
B007MNV5WU|5|awesome!!
B00LU8QCBM|5|Fantastic album. A must own.
B00SH04286|3|Sorry just OK
B0053O89JM|3|I LOVE House series and I own every season... But this season was not as great as I would have expected.
B00L9B7IKE|3|I plodded through this over-hyped mystery so annoyed by the stupid choices every character either makes or made in the past. Gone Girl did have you caring for at least one of the characters--then pulls the rug out from under you-all with a clever turn of phrase that The Girl on the Train lacks. Also, I resented the fact that key information was withheld until near the end--information one of the characters would definitely have brought up much earlier in their narrative.
B00005JOYM|4|I saw this film today, and can understand why people don't want to see the film.  But too often today, we want to forget what happened that day and wipe it from our memories.  But we can't do that.  We need to remember 9/11 always as we remeber other historic events.  Sometimes the best way to do that is with film.  And so long as you tell a true story as it happened, it is more important.  World Trade Center is a great film, but it has small aspects to it that Stone missed that good have made it better.  But one thing Oliver Stone did right was not to inject the film with his trademark paranoia and cinicism.  He tell the story from the point of view of two port authority cops and tells their story of survival.  The acting is supurb, and the visuals stunning.  You really felt as if you were there. <br />And now for the small things I didn't like.  Stone seemed afraid to show the planes crashing into the towers, and so we never see it happen.  I know that would be difficult to see, but that is what happened.  And as much as we would all like to erase that from our memories, it happened just the same.  Stone also seemed afraid to say it was Islamic terrorism that caused this horrific event.  On both of these counts, Paul Greengrass's United 93 is not afraid to show.  Which is why that film is superior to World Trade Center. <br />But for all it's flaws, World Trade Center is worth it to see, and helps you remember all the good in the world.  This was the first Oliver Stone movie I actually liked.
B000X1Z0BU|4|****1/2<br /><br />\\"Once\\" is a story about a man and a woman who conduct a courtship almost entirely through song.  Music being the primary medium in which these two individuals move through life, it is only appropriate that they should express their love for one another through music as well.<br /><br />Glen Hansard plays a struggling songwriter/musician whose recent, emotionally devastating breakup with the girl of his dreams now serves as the inspiration for most of his lyrics.  Marketa Irglova is a young woman who recently emigrated from the Czech Republic with her mother and daughter to begin a new life in Ireland.  She, too, is a composer of music, though she is less assertive and confident about exposing it to others than he is.  The two meet on the street one night while he is performing one of his original compositions and they begin a slow, tentative relationship based largely on their mutual love of music.<br /><br />\\"Once\\" is a beautiful, lyrical and heartbreaking film that has understandably garnered a passionate cult following since its release in early 2007.  It is an utterly unique and spellbinding work in which the music is every bit as important as the dialogue.  The plot, though basic and uncluttered, still manages to throw a few curveballs our way in an acknowledgment that romantic relationships do not always work out in the way we`d like.  Filmmaker John Carney keeps it as simple and intimate in his directorial style as he does in his writing, utilizing an unobtrusive and relatively steady handheld camera that nicely matches the rhythms and beats of the music playing in the background (and often in the foreground).  The scene in which the camera, in a single unbroken shot, moves ahead of Irglova as she strolls along the streets of the city singing an original composition is one of the truly transcendent movie moments of 2007.  And the music itself is lovely, flavorful and memorable - reason alone, I'd say, for seeing the film.<br /><br />In addition to their obvious talents as singers and musicians, Hansard and Irglova give performances of such poignancy and subtle emotion that they draw us instantly into the hearts of their characters.<br /><br />If \\"Once\\" reminds us of any film, it is probably the French classic, \\"A Man and a Woman,\\" another work whose tale of romantic love was intimately woven through music (although, in that film, the characters themselves were not singing or composing works).  That's not a bad template for a romantic movie, when you get right down to it.<br /><br />Since \\"Once\\" is a film that it is much better to experience than it is to read about, I suggest you try it on for yourself.  You won't regret it.ts as singers and musicians, Hansard and Irglova give performances of such poignancy and subtle emotion that they draw us instantly into the hearts of their characters.

B008YRVW0I|5|I just love this game. It is so much fun and awesome to play. There are so many things that you can buy!  ;)
B009369Z8A|5|TH gets better with every film.  His portrayal of Forrest is amazingly understated, believable and intense.  I'm ready for the next one!
B00L9B7IKE|4|Very interesting premise. I couldn't put it down.  I liked it better than my husband, however.
B003Y5H5HY|5|This is all about person preference.  This international version of the Swedish series of three books and films, does it very well.<br />  Peter M Johns MD
B00JZK0QNM|2|Version 1.7.0 was 4 stars (my main issue is that no matter what only 3 stars heroes appear), but version 1.7.2 has lots of bugs, for example: the buttons' coordinates are messed up (if one wants to tap a button or deploy the &#34;reinforcements&#34; one has to aim somewhere to the left of the intended area to tap). If the developers fix that issue (and the one that one has to uninstall and then reinstall to update the game), I'll update my review because it's a good game.
B00BTHWFBK|3|It wasn't like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. It had its moments though. Ozzy sounded great. The guys look great in the photos.
B008JGSM6G|3|This was not interesting enough for me.  Deleted from my Kindle.  If you really don't have any thing to do it would keep your mind busy for a little while.

0810989956|1|I was not happy with the quality of this purchase. It stated it was in good condition which was incorrect! The book came dirty, some form of brown residue on the front and back cover as well on some of the pages of the book. The entire book had been written in. My daughter was very upset and i ended up having to go buy the same book brand new. This sale actually cost me more instead of saving. I am VERY displeased with this purchase!
B0050DIWFC|3|Good story,  quick read.  Enjoyed it and was able to get through it pretty fast . usually a book like this doesn't keep my attention long enough to finish it.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Loved it.  Well written, kept my interest the while way through.
B007HO392S|5|Love it
B000SEIK2S|3|A new twist to sci-fi and a quick read that moves at a rapid pace.  Never would I have thought of immortality in this way.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great graphics lots of fun!<br />Very worthwhile and challenging.
B004XQYBA2|5|The customization for difficulty and appearance in addition to multiple options available for style of gameplay make this easily the BEST Sudoku app out there. All the fun and challenge without having to keep track of anything or write it down. Intuitive tools, taps, and functionality in addition to help guide.  An absolute must-have for Sudoku fans on Android!
B00FAPF5U0|5|great for your mind to stay sharp and alert challenging to see how your friends are doing , better than chess game

0307474259|5|This is a must read for everyone. We have been following dietary advise from the so called experts to our demise- as it relates to weight management and nutrition. This book delves into the true determinants of why we get fat and provides a systematic pathway for what to do about it.  It's a long overdue treatise on nutrition that is well written and packed with evidence based research to substantiate his recommendations.
B006LSZECO|3|This book has been reviewed so extensively and so well, I doubt that I can add much, except to say I don't think I've ever thrown a book down in disgust when I finished it.  But I did this time, and I felt that I had been ripped off by wasting so much of my time reading it.  I simply could not fathom why a good writer (and she is) would choose to end a novel in that way.  The only thing I could figure was that she wants to write a sequel.  But will anyone bother reading it after being treated this way?<br /><br />I will also say that I felt the novel was too long.  It very much strains the bounds of literary license by the end, as Amy pulls off criminal acts with such ease, and gets away with them, that I found myself muttering, &#34;Oh, come ON!&#34;  The police are getting a bad rap these days, but these law enforcement officers are portrayed as the Keystone Cops, with the exception of the female detective.  And even she has no real khutzpa.  Gillian Flynn must have an editor, or at least get editorial advice...they both failed her.
0375714839|4|bought this as a required reading for my literature class in college, a good read!
0553805371|5|Highly recommended for college undergraduate and graduate level science students. Serves as an excellent, highly readable treatise to explain the rationalistic (logical) basis of any scientific inquiry.
1607747308|3|Hard to focus my attention due to the writer's style and the subject matter.  Content is wort while.
B004MC8CA2|5|this bible app has it all. it has made it so easy to take the bible on the go. it has so many different versions of the bible that its like having over 20 different bibles in one book. the highlighting and bookmark  tool is very helpful. you must get this app!!
B000002AH7|4|It's a good album, kind of boring because here Miles doesn't shows what he is.
B000FBFN1U|5|It's so hard to put any of them down! GEORGE R.R Martin weaves each book together fabulously. There are always many surprises in each one. You never know what will happen next. A must read!!
B00000IAU3|5|At first listen, the sheer beauty of Dido's music will sweep you away. Each track is crafted with a different feel to it, so each one is an experience. Songs like Here With Me, Hunter, Isobel and Thank You are unique in their originality, not only of music but lyrics as well. Don't Think Of Me, All You Want and I'm No Angel are worthy themes for any girl getting over a break up and My Lover's Gone and Take My Hand are beautifully done. Dido's voice is lovely and her lyrics are well written. This CD is an essential for any collection and is wonderful for background in addition to a great listen.
B001UTW7QU|5|Fringe is a show I could watch over and over again. Very sad the series was ended. Hope that they make a Fringe movie!
0670024856|5|I read this for a book club, and found it to be a well written, entertaining, and educational book. It never dragged and was fast paced.
B00H58VGIA|4|Kidd has embellished and fleshed out some real history, which makes this an even more compelling read. I liked that she did not make the relationship between Sarah and Handful super friendly or loving. The power dynamics of the master and slave relationship really makes that implausible. I was uncomfortable with Sarah's motivations for teaching Handful to read, as well as some other decisions that I won't describe here and spoil the story, but then again I realized that those very flawed and human motivations just made the characters more realistic. This was a great read, and I highly recommend it.
B00CKJ2KK2|5|Oh my got sneaky look at that game
B00AEJM6H2|5|It's a great game...I love it
193700788X|1|Do not waste your money on this book.<br /><br />If you are a Sookie Stackhouse lover do not read this piece of merde!  Glad I borrowed the book, Mrs. Harris has the right to finish her story how she likes. Absolutely.  But this book is a slap in the face to all the fans who have read your stories for years.  I hope you have lots of $$$ because I will never pay on cent to read another of your books.
B000JMKQX0|4|I've only heard great things about this book but I was still hesitant to read it. I had heard that the movie based off the book was about to hit theatres, so I decided to read it before it came out. I shouldn't have done it. The book is so much different from the movie in that there are so many point of views. It's a very interesting read and I wasn't able to put it down till I finished.<br /><br />The movie was from one person's point of view but it incorporated some of the books characters pov's. I enjoyed the movie and book seperately. This book was definitely my favorite zombie book. I would recommend anyone who likes zombies and Stephen King to read this book.
B00GRPD0J0|1|It is disgusting,that there is no intranet in the sy<br />ystem,forget about internet,I had an account rameshmathur.1@gmail.com,I was unable to access through Dr.'s kindle and they created a new account rameshmathur7@gmail.com which is accessible on laptop with internet explorer and on the same laptop on Google chrome it is not accessible and on Google it takes rameshmathur.1@gmail.com and not rameshmathur7@ it will be nice of you to tell me how I can get out of this mess and this gmail  confusions.I was happy with Yahoo.Reply if you have some courtesy or gmail accounts will remain dead junk not knowing where to throw this garbage.Hope you take it in a positive attitude.
B00BJA2VFW|5|I am having so much fun playing this game!  It`s hard to put down.  A great way to get your mind off things and relax.  I play it at night after a long day at work.  Thumbs up!  Great job Big Fish!
B00QW8TYWO|3|I didn't really like it much, so I deleted it from my device, so overall it's ok.
B004TI5N38|4|This was a very different Baldacci book.  Well written as usual but a different kind of a story.  The West Virginia setting added an unusual twist to the plot.
0140177396|5|This is a masterpiece. This is a story of alienation, friendship and heartbreak. This novella is so tightly crafted, and the characters are so well developed. Steinbeck was still at the absolute height of his powers as one of the all time great American writers when this was written. I had not read this book in over 40 years and I was astonished by how well it has held up. This is a beautifully written tragedy.
B0064MPXFA|5|Love this show. It's entertaining and my husband will watch with me. Lots of sub stories. Lots of twists and surprises
B00CHSPB8Y|5|This game is a lot of fun! I play it more than any other game. I think there should be more ways and easier ways for getting the jewels though... or make the armors a little cheaper.
0345529057|5|Great price. Nice box set, nothing fancy.<br /><br />I gave this to a friend as a Christmas present and they love it.
B00C8S9W0G|5|I was going to to headline this as 'Amazing.'. But that would have done an injustice to how great this book and this author really are. I can't say thank you enough for this story, for the people in it and for the fact that you wrote it. To the author..you are incredible. Outside the ordinary. You have written an adventure and a life story with a love in it that has brought me Laughter and tears. To readers..read this and understand it. Start at the beginning and follow to where it ends..it's worth it. You will know these people like family, love this author and spend countless hours (I have re-read them often) wishing you could know as much, experience as much and love as deeply as the people in this book do. Diana Gabaldon, Thank you for everything you did to bring these characters, this time period (these time periods) and this kind of devotion to the printed page.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Started watching Downton Abbey with Season 1.  Have watched all the seasons so far in about two weeks!  GREAT show.  Hope they make a LOT more of them!!
B00FKF0F3C|1|I am not sure that Ken Follett wrote this book. His first book in this Trilogy was good. The second one was okay. This one was full of incorrect facts and Democratic propaganda. I am not sure why I finished it, except that once I start a book I always finish it. I have told everybody I know not to bother with reading it. Judy Harris
B00DVKOYBM|5|Who doesn't love billards!?!  Good game...easy/functionality and suits all ages.
B00FEHXCIG|1|What a waste of $4.99 on Amazon. This movie is lame the scrip is pathetic! Action are average and also the Mandarin is a joke.
B00DC7NNAC|5|Great twist on the old classic. Good storyline, excellent special effects. Liked the good vs. evil allegory and underlying lesson. Definitely recommend.
B0092ZEIN4|1|Bought it at Wal-Mart, wont even charge. What a piece of junk. If I could even get it to charge it would probably destroy my thumbs in the process.
B008JGSM6G|5|I find this game very delightful once I figured out how to use the entrance directions, which were vague to me! I'm speaking about the levels etc.
B008Y2FRFO|5|This game is so addicting and so much fun.  I find myself doing things to pass the time so I can save up coins.  Great game!
B009WO7NQO|4|Great graphics, great sounds, great puzzles. More fun and addicting than the original Angry Birds. Love the Star Wars tie-in.
B006Z1GLHO|5|Awesome
B007EC27QM|5|this is a great app so now I don't have go through the hours and look for a Cal or use my mind it is right there so I can use. :D 8*)
B0009P5YXO|5|I loved this toy so much even though I bought it as a gift, I didn't really want to give it away. So I bought a second one for myself. :) Now I take it where ever I go and use it when doors are locked. ;) You should definitely get this item if you want to be a cool kid.

B001USHRCK|5|Was a little difficult to assemble. Six and eight year old grandsons got a little frustrated but when it was done they had a lot of fun playing with the Village. It does not come in bags with sections and there are a lot of pieces to sort and the boy are used to the presorted bags. It holds up well (except for the tree) after it is assembled. We have built eight or nine sets and this Is one of the best so far.
1400052173|5|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, by Rebecca Skloot, is probably the best book I've read in years.  It's the true story of an African-American woman named Henrietta Lacks, and how her brief fight with an incredibly invasive and deadly cervical cancer, ended her short life but left the world an infinite supply of living cancer cells to do research with.<br /><br />The author skillfully presents, in laymen's terms, the story of Mrs. Lacks and her incredible cells, and how they affected medical science, and the lives of her descendants who struggled to understand it all.  Skloot gets inside the tight circle of understandably bitter and paranoid remaining Lacks family members, and investigates the history of their  immortal mother, wife, sister and grandmother.<br /><br />This book will have you both applauding the accomplishments of the scientists who used Henrietta Lacks cancer cells to learn about cancer, genetics and other medical miracles that were critical vehicles used to get to where modern medicine is today;  and then teary-eyed as you read about the suffering of the deceased woman&#34;s children, who grew up abused and riddled with extreme poverty, unaware that their mothers cells were making millions of dollars for pharmaceutical companies and biological labs across the world.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we follow  Henrietta Lacks through her childhood and young marriage, and learn of her  daughter, Elsie, who was born with mental and physical defects and ultimately was placed in a facility of horrors called &#34;The Hospital for the Negro Insane,&#34; in Crownsville, Virginia, where she suffered in over-crowded and inhumane conditions, until she died at 16, from what her records diagnose as &#34;respiratory failure,&#34; but all evidence is to the contrary.<br /><br />A large part of the story is devoted to Henrietta's surviving daughter, Deborah, and her difficulties both emotionally and physically, trying to separate truths and untruths about her mothers legacy, all with a limited educational background.<br /><br />I learned a lot from this book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in reading about an incredible woman, her unknown gift to the world, and the colorful cast of characters that survive her.tional background.

B004J4WLB4|5|I must be honest, I have seen The Language of Flowers in every bookstore, every book newsletter I get, and on the bestseller lists.  Why I never picked it up, I have no idea.  I saw it on LibraryThing.com's list of books that could be requested.  I figured if I won a copy, it would be meant to be, and I would finally read this popular book.<br /><br />I won and I am so glad The Language of Flowers found me!  I can't tell you enough how much I loved this book!  I devoured it in 24 hours.  This between raising 3 little girls, a cat and 2 puppies, plus my niece's birthday party in San Diego.  Needless to say, I read this book every moment I found myself with a extra minute or two.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers tells the story of Victoria and begins when she is 18 and emancipated from the foster system she has been in her whole life.  The book travels back and forth from current time to Victoria's time with her foster mother, Elizabeth.  It is this relationship that shapes Victoria and her views of herself and love.<br /><br />Victoria learns the language of flowers from Elizabeth.  The flowers that surround Victoria tell her story and speak for her many times when she cannot speak for herself.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!  It is seriously one of my favorites.  There were so many emotions I went through reading it, crying tears of sadness and joy, sometimes at the same time.
B003J27WFW|5|No band in history has ever been more deserving of the love, adulation and loyalty this band has received. This is a great tribute not only to the band but to the fans. Each fans relationship with this band is so personal it's nice when things like this come around, it unites us all.
B00B8R1NP0|2|Torture from first chapter.  Horrible dialogue with same phrases repeated over and over.  The story might have been interesting if you could get past the writing.
B004Z2TUGE|4|I thought it was well done. The action scenes were good and the story line kept my interest. Hope they do a sequel.
B002MQYOFW|5|This book was amazing and I don't like to read but this book will having you want to go on and on .... it's nothing like the movie it's so much better  can't wait to read the next one!!!
B00004TWZF|4|Issues of format aside, people either love this movie or hate it, depending it seems on familiarity and acceptance of the metephore on which this movie is based.  The US is rooted in English culture, a society with a singular relationship with the ocean:  dark, violent, and cold - a sea so dangerous, they dug a tunnel under it.  Most of the rest of western Europe, and all those shown in this movie, are connected to the Mediteranian.  This creates an all together different relationship with the sea, a bright, warm, and calm place where the ocean is mother, giver of life, and the depths of the sea are the womb of the Earth.  Understand and accept this relationship, and the movie makes sense - a cascade of elegant gestures.  Do not and the story is but a series of weak and unrelated sub plots.
B000P0J024|5|I can't believe we had to wait until 2007 for this awesome collection to be released ! Sadly, the T.W. albums have been out of stock for years. Now we can enjoy the remastered version of their hits and unrealeased tracks in this awesome collection featuring a bonus DVD.    For those unfamiliar with the band, the members are Jeff Lynne from ELO, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison who passed away while in this band, George Harrison and Bob Dylan. All five used to have some kind of great success in the past so no one was looking for easy money or pretension. All five are great musicians who brought unique styles and creations to rock music. And, most of all, there was already great friendship between the members when they began working together.     The result => a genial and highly enjoyable piece of creation. This collection features memorable songs that should remain in music history as a perfect example of how camaderie can bring gorgeous results in the studio.

B00G4NUQYM|5|Challenging, some of the clues make you think out of the box, which is good.  Increased my vocabulary, now if I can just remember the words and use them correctly.
B00004WIDQ|4|I saw \\"Jurassic Park\\" at the theater with my then-girlfriend wife in 1993. There was much anticipation concerning Spielberg's dinosaurs and, as far as that goes, the film delivers. The story is a good-enough stage for the dinosaurs and the characters are okay. As my title blurb points out, this is essentially a Disney adventure with horrific dinosaurs.<br /><br />The latter is where the film excels, but it takes a whole hour to arrive. The good thing about the long wait is that it creates much anticipation. (\\"[[ASIN:B00003CXXS Jurassic Park III (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]]\\" does the exact opposite and suffers for it). When the t-rex sequence arrives it is both most welcome and truly horrifying. Two other thrilling scenes are memorable - the t-rex chasing the jeep and the closing velociraptor sequence, particularly in the kitchen.<br /><br />As far as the principle cast goes, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are effective as the male protagonists while Laura Dern is likable enough. She doesn't trip my trigger in the sex appeal department, but that's just a matter of taste. The kids are good, especially the girl (Ariana Richards), while Richard Attenborough comes across as Santa Claus. Wayne Knight plays the quasi-villain and he originally struck me as wandering off the set of another movie. Seeing the film recently, he's still a bit over-the-top and cartoony, but provides a necessary contrast to the other characters.<br /><br />The film runs 127 minutes and was shot in Hawaii, Dominican Republic and Costa Rica.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The dinosaurs and thrills are A+ while the story and characters are just good-enough. This is a straight-ahead family-friendly adventure with little depth and there's nothing wrong with that, especially since the film delivers what we came for - realistic-looking dinosaurs, and more - total horror.<br /><br />GRADE: B
B009T9P7OC|5|best i have seen.
B009NFHF0Q|5|This is a marvelous fantasy that captures both the pagan nature of children and the existential fears of childhood. One particularly beautiful passage captures the essense of the numinous religious experience.  But enough big words: this is a joy to read; I'd recommend it to readers young and old.
B000S1M9LY|1|dry and belabored, I gave it the prelude and first chapter but found as was waned in the prelude that this book was just not my style.
B008Q08PIK|5|Great film.
B0047WJ12K|2|This movie should have been perfect.  And (except for this movie) all the stars in it are good in their own rite.  But this was a brilliant idea that needed EVERY cast member replaced.  There wasn't a single one of them that was right for their parts. (And I thought DiCaprio could do anything. My bad.)<br /><br />The actors tried.  But this was horribly horribly cast, ultimately ruining the film.
B000VIK8D0|5|One of Kevin Costner's best performances. Dennis Quaid does a wonderful job as well. So much better than Kurt Russell in Tombstone.
B00BD99JMW|5|I reallu liked the action and the twists except for the &#34;Tris dying&#34; part. I wish it was not how it ended for her. But that could just be my wanting her love story with Tobias to continue on. Made me cry. Ending was done well but I had so much mixed emotions about it all together.
B00FN811SY|5|I highly recommend this for everyone. It's easy to use and invaluable to have.  Great for personal study and referencing.

B00C8S9W0G|5|Definitely worth the wait! Like all fans of The Outlander series I was anxiously waiting for this book to appear on my Kindle. Absolutely worth it! I loved every page and was absorbed immediately back into the lives if Jamie and Claire.
B00003CXHJ|5|If you're a fan of war film's, action and suspense, U-571 is what you're looking for!  While this film is not much as far as the historical value, who care's.  This film does exactly what everybody involved with it set out to do, entertain.  It has a clearly defined plot line and carries through with it in a splendid manner.  The depth charge scene was particularly explosive (no pun intended, yea right).  Matthew McConaughey does a wonderful job in this film.  Starting off as the efficient officer that's not quite ready for command and then transforming, due to circumstances, into a battle hardened leader of sailors.  Overall I would recommend to this film to anybody!  The special features included on this DVD are exceptional as well.

0812982622|2|This review goes out to all of you who, like me, slogged guiltily through 100 or more pages of this novel, then even more guiltily quit before finishing.  My clarion cry goes out to you thus: \\"Do Not Feel Guilty, O, Ye, Defenders of Character.\\"  Rare is the successful novel in which character finishes second to landscape (political, historical, geographical, technological, futuristic, etc.).  For me this novel fails to satisfy because political landscape overwhelms character.  It fails the most fundamental question of all fiction: why should I care?  Fifty or so pages in I fully get the point: North Korea is an oppressive, Kafkaesque regime.  But unless I really care about someone living and breathing and moving through that oppressive, Kafkaesque regime, I would rather read something else.  I can get the basic political point from the news.  In my fiction I want to experience living, breathing characters about whom I care.  (FYI, a couple of recent novels dealing wonderfully with characters first and political issues second: Vaddey Ratner's In the Shadow of the Banyan [Khmer Rouge atrocities] and Barbara Kingsolver's Flight Behavior [climate change]).
1401227821|5|I've been a fan of Adam Hughes for a long long time, I was still in high school when I bought my first issue of Ghost, penciled then when he was lesser known but still amazing. I no longer really read comics, though I do occasionally pick one up when the cover art grabs my attention and I was never too big into DC; this book, even so, is worth every penny.<br />It shows not only a much wider range of covers than I'd thought it would but also manages to capture a lot of his growth as an artist. From the days when he was a bit more generic up until he began to showcase his distinctive and beautiful &#34;good girl&#34; technique.<br />My favorite part of AH is that he manages to convey so much with so little. A lot of artists tend to pack in the detail and while they too tend to have some great work, I'm always amazed by Adam's ability to capture moods and gesture with a few well-placed lines.<br />I have only one complaint and I know that it's invalid. It's not enough! I need more, lol. I realize that this book covers his cover work on the DC universe but I want to see all of it. No doubt we'd end up with a book that would be large enough to ground a 757 and every UPS man would rue the day he was born but oh, I would live in the shadow of their hatred for such a volume.<br />For anyone into comics, Pin-ups, Adam Hughes or just great art; I sincerely recommend this book, even if you're just thinking it might be worth taking a look at, it is, take a look!
B00688628M|5|It's a must see series
B00D3ITOHG|5|Great set of headphones. Noise canceling. Great bass and mids! Loving using it at work. Great price. Strong durability. It can be a bit too snug, but that's why you should take it off from time to time.
B005LAIGP0|5|\\"The Woman In Black\\". Theatrical release: February 2012. It's a horror/thriller movie based on Susan Hill's book of the same title. It is a classical ghost story set in a village in the early Edwardian times (1901-1917) England. It lacks the fast-paced and gory scenes of contemporary horror films which I think is the strength of this motion picture. Although it's James Watkins' (director) second attempt on directing, he succeeded in frightening us and capturing our interest without splashing blood, displaying brutally dismembered bodies, or strong sexual content. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) as the lead, proved to be a successful gamble. Daniel brilliantly portrayed a mature solicitor which is a great departure from the mischievous adolescent Harry Potter we've gotten used to. Beside the evil ghost, the movie also deals with abstract human emotions such as the pain of loosing someone and cooping with the aftermath. So, prepare to be scared with class and eloquence with a hint of tragedy. I also recommend the book as it has a different ending.

B00004WEJZ|1|I have just recently just started watching the Bond movies. Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, etc. This is supposed to be a remake of the Bond Classic Thunderball. I prefer Thunderball much more than this. I wanted this movie to end since the first scene. This was almost like an Austin Powers movie. I prefer the other Bond competition that year, Octopussy. Here's a list what's different from Thunderball...<br />THUNDERBALL Locations: 75% Nassau, 2% Bahamas, 3% France, & 20% of the South of England.<br />NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN Locations: 10% Nassau, 2% Bahamas, 3% MI6 Training Area, 15% Africa.<br />THUNDERBALL Villian: Age - 50 (Eyepatch)<br />NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: Age - 35 (Both Eyes)<br />THUNDERBALL: ***1/2<br />NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: BOMB (thank god this wasn't an official bond)

B0000AUHPG|5|They don't make them like this anymore! Sergio Leone's love of the U.S. and in particular, the &quot;old west&quot; is readily apparent in this cinematic masterpiece. Unlike Leone's wonderful &quot;dollar&quot; pictures, this is a true Western with all of the elements that define it: a frontier between civilization and the wilderness, the civilized folk in peril, and a hero who must save them by employing the same skills as those who threaten and then take his dangerous skills away with him to the next frontier when the peril is over (e.g., Shane is an archetype of the true Western).<br />What makes this a highly unique film is that Leone gives us two heroes, one that fits the myth of the Old West in Harmonica (Charles Bronson) by being larger and better than life, and a more realistic hero with both good and bad qualities, Cheyenne (Jason Robards). One in (dusty) white, the other in earth tones. One who goes off into the sunset, light shining on him through the door as he leaves, and one who exits the way that all humans eventually do, without grandeur. The Morricone soundtrack is nothing short of amazing and you'll want to crank this movie through your stereo or home theater system for sure! Henry Fonda, who usually played heroes, turns in a terrific performance as one of the most evil screen villains ever. This film is required viewing for all film buffs and &quot;students&quot; of the Western and it's so rich in its imagery and dialogue you'll catch something new each time you watch it. Although most of the film was shot in Europe, keep your eyes open for director Leone's homage to the Western films of John Ford: he came all the way to the U.S. just to film one brief scene in Monument Valley!
0736430512|5|Of course my 3 year old little girl is Frozen crazy so I bought this book to add to her library collection. I didn't expect much from the story line considering this book was less than $3. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the book outlined the movie! Perfect for younger kids!

B009IEXKXI|5|Probably one of the most enjoyable \\"hard\\" science fiction books I have ever read. Mr. Weir actually makes lengthy technical and engineering details well, riveting. And he does it with a great deal of campy humor that makes this a very human story, not just a technological thriller. There are excellent psychological overlays, and one gets to know not only the primary character but many others quite well. Not that many books I have read have managed to be exciting in the page-turner sense, thoughtful, irreverent and a real hoot at the same time. \\"The Martian\\" truly does. Do yourself a favor and buy this book. You will be glad you did, unless you have an utter abhorrence of space, technology, and lame (but wonderful) jokes.

0393327655|5|I read this book backwards.  Well, not backwards figuratively (although I started off with the Afterword).  No, I read it backwards in that I first read Letter to a Christian Nation, in which author Sam Harris addresses some of the questions thrown at him by critics of The End of Faith.  Since Letter, I started reading The End of Faith.  I was immediately struck by three thoughts:<br /><br />1.  This book will not be read by those needing to receive this message.<br /><br />2.  There is much in Harris' arguments that can be gleaned in the first chapter.  At a minimum, encourage folk to read this portion of the book.<br /><br />3.  Sam Harris is right on target.<br /><br />Let me return to that first chapter.  You can't mistake his message:<br /><br />\\"A belief is a lever that, once pulled, moves almost everything else in a person's life\\" (p. 12).<br /><br />\\"Our situation is this: most of the people in this world believe that the Creator of the universe has written a book.  We have the misfortune of having many such books on hand, each making an exclusive claim as to its infallibility\\" (p. 13).<br /><br />\\"...criticizing a person's faith is currently taboo in every corner of our culture. ...Criticizing a person's ideas about God and the afterlife is thought to be impolite in a way that criticizing his ideas about physics or history is not\\" (p. 13).<br /><br />\\"Faith-based religion must suffer [a] slide into obsolescence\\" (p. 14).<br /><br />\\"Tell [a devout Christian] that the book he keeps by his bed was written by an invisible deity who will punish him with fire for eternity if he fails to accept its every incredible claim about the universe, and he seems to require no evidence whatsoever\\" (p. 15).<br /><br />\\"The point is that most of what we currently hold sacred is not sacred for any reason other than that it was thought sacred yesterday\\" (p. 24).<br /><br />\\"Our world is fast succumbing to the activities of men and women who would stake the future of our species on beliefs that should not survive an elementary school education\\" (p. 25).<br /><br />\\"In our next presidential election, an actor who reads his Bible would almost certainly defeat a rocket scientist who does not.  Could there be any clearer indication that we are allowing unreason and otherworldliness to govern our affairs\\" (p. 39)?<br /><br />\\"The Bible, it seems certain, was the work of sand-strewn men and women who thought the earth was flat and for whom a wheelbarrow would have been a breathtaking example of emerging technology\\" (p. 45).<br /><br />And finally, \\"I pray that we may one day think clearly enough about these matters to render our children incapable of killing themselves over their books\\" (p. 49).<br /><br />Read this important book.

B003XVYLDU|5|I'm not entirely sure where to begin with this review and mindful that so many others have written so much about Slaughter House Five, but I found the book riveting and frankly not at all what I expected. This book is touted in many circles as science fiction but it could just as easily be identified as part autobiographical and largely a political and social commentary.<br /><br />I can believe at the time of publishing it would have shocked many with its themes and language, and it saddens me a little that the same themes and language would be considered mainstream nowadays, but it does not take away from the power of the novel.<br /><br />A great read on many levels and a finger addition to anyone's library.
B00C1BU7V8|4|Good movie for history buffs. Big takeaway was the use of executive war powers to end slavery and how slavery could have been reinstated by southern states if the 13th amendment was not passed and ratified.
0316228583|1|I feel strongly that if you write an outstanding series for children, you have a certain responsibility to maintain values in future books, even those intended for adults. Like a child star gone wrong, this book went the wrong way ... Language & situations just way too dark!!!  It dampened my enjoyment of the Harry Potter series.
B001UTW7QU|3|J.j. Abrams definitely has his own look.<br />This show is great television. It's no X files... however it is fun to watch.
079213690X|4|That's what I say about this film. It's interesting on so many levels; for example: it's a rousing adventure and a somewhat tender love story, despite  some really barbaric scenes. Let me just say that I HATE Mel Gibson! I am not a fan of his, the only reason I have this film is because it won the Best Picture Oscar of 1995 -- that's all! But I do enjoy watching this film for it's vast shots of land (John Toll won the Best Cinematography Oscar), the battle scenes, and when Gibson dies in the end! Yes, it's harsh, I know, but that's how I feel about Gibson, who, in my opinion, is not a great actor or director (he just got lucky that year, like Kevin Costner, who I also hate with a great passion, did in 1990 for &quot;Dances with Wolves.&quot;)  Patrick McGoohan, as King Edward Longshanks, is wonderful as the resident baddie who, of course, outsmarts William Wallace (Gibson) and has him killed. And those two beautiful ladies, Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCormack, are lovely as Isabelle and Murron respectively.  Anyway, I give the film a good rating, not because of Gibson, but because of the supporting cast, the beautiful shots of the green lands, and the battles fought. Winner of 5 Academy Awards including Picture, Director (Gibson), Cinematography, Sound Effects Editing, and Makeup.
B00HETHVKM|5|Great!
B00D6BQPMM|1|I watched this because of all the media boost it got, it was pathetic, I understand teen movies but talk about sad, its basically another twilight movie, and I knew it and still watched it but I guess I have no one to blame but myself. There's not much to the plot, basically a zombie that falls in love and wants to get in the girls pants, classic modern teen movie.
B000023VR6|5|I owned this album when it first came out.  One day, all of my cds and stereo system in my car were stolen.  I had forgotten about this cd for about ten years.  I forgot how amazing this cd is.
B000003TAR|5|This is by far the best album I've ever bought.  I got it because I love Heart-Shaped Box, and I was pleasently surprised by all the other songs.  Nirvana is the best band there ever was, and ever will be.
B002KEF92S|5|Great movie, love the extras!
B000XV6VOK|5|I have only the highest praise for season 2 of The Tudors.  I don't want to give away spoilers by going into the plot.  Yes, it is history which we all pretty much know.  But it is amazing to see it played out in front of you with 3 dimsional characters that make the facts take a life of their own.<br /><br />The presentation is glorious.  The scenery, costumes and all to do with the time period is breath taking and expertly done.  And the acting is of the highest caliber.<br /><br />I find complaints people have had with this season to be rather minimal.  Anyone can take a masterpiece and have something with it that does not please them.  For me everything about this show gives it an A +++++.  King Henry and Anne Boleyn are the center here but all the other historical pieces are expertly put in.<br /><br />I am amazed how the show manages to show history so true to fact, true to life and mezmerizing to view.  Season 2 is an entity to itself and such ensemble acting is rare to find.  View this and you will see only the highest quality television available, refresh your history knowledge and see the best acting out there.<br /><br />Kudos.

My hubby sent it to Singapore for me =) Can't wait for the 2nd season!

0804170126|3|I don't read a whole lot of books, and I have only peered into a few of Mirakami's works however this was the cheapest Murakami book on the shelf and it seemed interesting eneough.<br /><br />This book is definitely not a lift you up kind of book, it's more of a downer honestly. And we deal with this up and down sort of wave constantly as humans, so I was thinking- maybe hearing all of this will be a good thing, I'll be familiar with the bleak outlook on life..<br /><br />The writing can be so obvious that it makes you laugh at points. About three times maybe four I laughed out loud by predictability of the book. I never had encountered that while reading his books in the past, but this seemed to be the most obvious quality of the book.<br /><br />(Small Spoils) The main character is also very relatable also so you are pressed into finding out what his ailments are- the reason why he is so colorless.  The themes that are strewn through the book emphasize personal power, Inner work, curve balls of life, friendship, solitude.<br /><br />Could be a very enjoyable read if you are okay with things being bad before they are better, and don't mind knowing how the story may play out a page or so in advance.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Best looking calculator ever made! Get this, you will like it. This will make you find excuses to use a calculator, this one is fun.
B003L77FYS|4|Bought as gift for my son because it was on his wish list.  He and his wife enjoy the show and Nathan Fillion.
B000KRNCYY|5|Love the lovely voices of these women. They are so intriguing and restful.  I love to listen and relax to the music.
B008MEM24S|5|Got this as free app of the game. What a game. Really makes you think. Some levels have some real twist and makes you work really hard.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great fun. Play it with the little one all the time. Get the game remote for the fire stick though otherwise it's pretty challenging to complete challenges in time.
B004T32SOK|4|Box is convenient for my use and fills my need for Cloud storage. Having the free storage is a plus.
B00M55C0LK|3|This was a first for me to get a memory card from SanDisk and have it not work...at all!  nothing I had would read it, initialize it or function at all and with me buying 4 at a time it isn't because of lack of knowledge as all the others worked just fine as is normal for SanDisk.  But once I turned it in that it was bad I got a new one shipped to me right away even before sending the old one back and of course the new one worked as it should.
B00EMJBVAI|5|Great
B000O8OTNC|4|Sharpens very nicely. Nice and small to keep around. I keep mine on my desk at work.
B0092MKTL2|5|Night Visions is an amazing first release for Imagine Dragons and, along with their past EPs, has quickly helped establish them as one of my top groups to listen too.
B00LZXOI5E|3|This is a good game to play to pass the time.
B002VECM6S|5|Good movie.
B007HACDLK|4|While Vince Flynn has put forth another exciting plot line with the intriguing and often dark CIA world of a covert special operations, this was not his most stellar storytelling.
B001F6ZIXC|5|once u get past the first few episodes i promise you'll be hooked<br /><br />and the main actor is awesome, cant wait for next season
B000JMKRKC|5|Excellent, very hard to put down! Loved the ending...❤️
B008Y2FRFO|2|At first I loved this game, it reminded me of when I was young and played it at carnivals.  I don't mind have to download another app to get free coins (although that is annoying).  After I got the coins I just deleted the other apps.  It's slow and hard to move along but so was the original where you used real quarters.  After a while I began noticing that when the prizes fell off the edge some of them never get added to your score.  One time I &#34;purchased&#34; 2 bonus buckets of prizes with the dozer coins I had accumulated and out of 8 prizes that I was given half of them never registered in my game prize card.  As I get further along in the game this happens more and more often.  Quite a rip off for the amount of time you put into playing the game.
B001K3JF7K|2|I have been listening to Diana Krall for at least six years now and am particularly fond of her jazzier outings, most notably All for You which was the first one I picked up and still receives regular play in my high end stereo system.  I pre-ordered this CD with high hopes but find myself deeply disappointed.  While the sound quality of Quiet Nights is excellent I find the music, arrangements, and vocal performance all to be bland and uninspired.  As a fan I can only hope that this is the temporary result of having twin two-year-olds.  I've listened to the CD three times and I'm not sure there will be a fourth.  Judging from my own intentions and the other reviews here all interested parties will have no trouble finding an affordable used copy of this CD.  It's not entirely without redeeming merit - it makes fine background music and of course it could always be used as a reflector to keep birds out of one's garden.
B005ZUR724|2|ok well this game is 5stars definatley but I tried to play it today and there is an unavailable update. like what the fudge!?!?
B00KW23WOC|5|Great movie.A lot of action and espionage.
B00F8L2VO4|5|Great addicting app! Helped me learn alot of new words!
B00T4GYI54|5|When I started, I loved it. Even now, afterwards I still love King of Thieves. Zeptolab has made another great game where you complete logic puzzles to complete your objectives.
B003Z49LYO|5|At the end of this tragic series I felt so sad for this poor woman and all her trials. My heart ached for her and her struggles. Great series, I loved it.
B00000IWVS|5|This disc, recorded in 1965, has previously been unreleased because of the exclusivity terms of Argerich's contract with DGG which followed on closely from these recording sessions. Argerich went on to record a disc for DGG which was very similar in content to this recording for EMI but it is arguable that this earlier disc captured the finer recital especially when it is now possible to compare the two side by side.<br /><br />The piano sound on this EMI disc is very realistic and full toned. It is cut at a high level which makes the Abbey Road studio sound rather 'bigger' than normal giving the illusion of a large empty hall rather than the recording studio. The piano timbre has no trace of woodenness, only verging on slightly clangorous timbre at moments of greatest power. These issues can easily be tamed by slightly reducing the playback level. Whatever, the playing is of such splendour and gripping intensity that any quibbles over recorded sound perfection are completely negated by the musical results and their impact.<br /><br />A generalisation can be made when comparing the DGG alternative with this slightly earlier set. It is often very difficult for artists to re-capture the spontaneity of first attempts even if later attempts may achieve greater technical perfection. Thus Argerich's EMI recital recorded on this disc has a freshness and spontaneity of expression that is not quite matched by the, admittedly fine, DGG alternative.<br /><br />There is just a touch of hard driving about the sonata, scherzo and polonaise in the later DGG disc which is not present in this EMI predecessor. This current disc offers a typically crisp range of tempi, but it achieves that velocity, power and excitement without any trace of being over-driven. Apparently, the final movement of the sonata was recorded in one full take and that may explain the enhanced suggestion of spontaneity present throughout this disc. The rest of the program, the three mazurkas and the nocturne, are examples of jewel-like and delicate miniatures.<br /><br />This then, is a very special recording which captures Argerich in full youthful and unspoiled enthusiastic form. There is an unusual degree of spontaneity present throughout and I would suggest that this disc would make a most attractive addition to any collector's record library even if the later DGG disc is already on collectors' shelves.e examples of jewel-like and delicate miniatures.<br /><br />This then, is a very special recording which captures Argerich in full youthful and unspoiled enthusiastic form.

B005Q1W10A|5|If you are a British TV buff then this series is for you!  Nicely acted and beautifully shot, Downton comes alive!
B004QX07G4|3|I love Ellen DeGeneres.  She's funny, smart, well-spoken and open.  This book was a reflection of all of those attributes, but I didn't feel as though there was a real message in the stories she told.
B00957T6X6|5|It definitely leaves you wanting more. I can't wait for the next book. This was my second time reading this series and it still kept me engrossed.
B002MQYOFW|5|Very interesting all the way through from beginning to end.<br />I would recommend this book to be read by many people, I think it's appropriate for many age groups.
B00GRVEDCM|5|This is a different style of TCG. The game play is fun and the art is awesome! Have only been playing for a week, but it's already one of my favorite games.
B00006690F|5|Fantastic Eminem, you have done it again.  The first time I listened to the album, i walked away in a state of shock.. which is what I believe Eminem would like us to do!!  Best album of them all.  Congrats!
1573301183|5|Arrived in described time line and item is as listed.
B000066NW0|5|I noticed I cant rate her cd higher than 5 but I am rating it as a 10!  I first found out about Avril about 2 months ago, and fell in love the first time I heard it!  Shes a gifted young woman and proves she has AMAZING! talent!!  I HIGHLY recommend this CD!  There isn't one song I dont like!!!!
B001TCHDPS|5|Wonderful 70's music which was lost for decades! I love Rodriguez! I need his music every day now! Thanks South Africa!
0446364495|5|I love the book, in fact reread it 3 times and it never failed to touch me deeply.  I just wonder how readers could give it a 1 to 4 or even 7 book rating when the author incorported lots of deep and meaningful language, colorful comparizons.. i.e. Peregrine.  For me it is a &quot;10&quot; ten times over.  I specially love the scene where Francesca was in the car with her husband and watching Robert Kincaid drive away....I cried my heart out on that scene.  This book will stay with me forever!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4|This is a great game for free.  I love this movie and who doesn't love the minions?<br />My kids can't get enough of this game and I am right there with them.
B00H7VCKKS|3|OK movie
0316227706|5|Bought several of these last December, along with the calendars, to give out over Christmas. This book is great! If you're a dog lover, you'll literally laugh out loud on about half the pages you turn. The pics are super detailed & clear, and really bring out the expressions in the dogs' faces. One of my co-workers got a berating from his wife on their big, family Christmas day; after opening this, he kept paging through the book & laughing, instead of paying attention to the rest of the family opening presents. :)
B002ZG981E|4|Good movie
0812550706|5|Ender is a young boy who faces all kinds of demons in this book.  In the not so distant future, aliens have already attacked once, and are about to attack again.  Those in charge are scrambling to find someone to save the world against the aliens, and Ender is the one they find.<br />Ender's Game is entertaining and well written, but those who read it purely for entertainment value will also find something much greater.  This book forces you to think about some critical issues.<br />To put it simply, this book is one of the best there is.
B00992CF6W|4|I love minecraft but it still costs $7!!!! It doesn't have the ender eye so you can't go to the end.😞 and most of the villages are small.it is kind of worth the money but it is still way overpriced. I hope in  a little while they will bring down the price. Over all I give it 4 stars.
B000W7JWUA|5|Can't go wrong with Catan.
B0041KKYEW|5|The first two acts of this movie are...well, I don't want to say ordinary, it's too well-made for that, but although I was enjoying the film at that point, I also felt that it was a little overrated. I kept thinking, &#34;This got a Best Picture nomination? How did that happen?&#34;<br />But the third act, when they're actually putting on the ballet in front of an audience, along with everything that's going on backstage and everything that's going on inside of Nina's head, might possibly be the most beautiful thing I've seen on film in the past decade. It literally took my breath away; as the credits rolled, I suddenly realized that I had stopped breathing. I'm not sure that's ever happened to me before.<br />So it's a good movie, elevated to greatness by a tremendous final act, and that's good enough to place it at #7 on my personal list of the Best Films of the 21st Century. Definitely, definitely worth owning.
B00A9X9TIW|3|This movie was more violent than I expected.  Some of the story was a bit confusing too, but I guess that can happen where time travel is involved.  On a high def TV the way they altered Joseph Gordon-Levitt's face so he looked more like a young Bruce Willis was obvious and a bit distracting at times.  Overall the movie was okay, I'm glad I rented instead of seeing in the theater, though.
0893860220|1|As the others said - a lot of nothing. As far from truth as Russ, Huckabee and Glenn Beck's crap.
B00KDEVVDI|5|Well designed and executed. Smooth, fast and simple to navigate.<br />For a complex application and subject it is very intuitive.<br />Great app!
B0015346OM|5|He liked the book but he found it an issue remembering everyone's names . There were a lot of people involved but the mission was exciting.
B006LSZECO|4|This book was not what I was expecting at all, but it was certainly a pleasant surprise! I loved, loved, loved it and couldn't put it down! As a precaution: be ready for lots of &#34;f-bombs&#34; and explicit language, and a rather disappointing ending (in my opinion). However, I would recommend it to anyone!
B0042JTDXK|1|I was anxious to purchase Josh Groban's latest CD \\"Illuminations\\". I even preordered it before it was released without hearing any of the samples and I must say that I'm very disappointed. What happened to the Josh Groban that made his 1st two CDs? I just finished listening to the whole CD and there doesn't seem to be any melody to his songs. It's like listening to opera. He should either go \\"classical\\" or go back to his melodic love songs that tell a story. I  understand he used to work with James Foster. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to go back with him. Also I wish Josh would stick to ALL Engish songs on his CDs. I love to sing along with him on my 1st two CDs but not this one. From now on, I'll listen to the samples of his music before I purchase one or maybe just purchase individual songs. If his future CDs are like this one I'm afraid he's lost my interest. Sorry, Josh!
B007JNWJMI|3|Ok.
B00136NVGK|4|I love this CD! Disc 1 is very soothing. Some of his songs are just beautiful and timeless. And Disc 2 when you want to get funky. There are a few songs missing but overall it's a great collection!
B002ZG99TK|5|Seen this movie several times on TV never the full version. This DVD was just what I expected is was great
B0036S4B6M|5|What an eye opener! Thank you, Piper, for sharing your experience with the world. You are an inspiration to all women who had to make the best out of a bad situation. You did it with grace and style.
B00AIUUXHC|5|This is the best game ever you have to try it you can upgrade your shark and you can also buy a baby it is really good buy it and you will have a lot of fun
B004QKNXIQ|5|Great movie for kids! Hours of entertainment
B00393R1ZC|5|Although I was a little disappointed when I first received my new Daria DVD collection and read inside that the original music used in the tv series from popular songs at the time (this was MTV after all) was not in the DVD episodes because it would have cost the publishers a lot of dough, I have enjoyed watching these episodes I haven't seen in more than 10 years so much that I have forgotten those popular songs were there when it aired on MTV in the 1990's. Daria stands on her own as hilarious and poignant as ever. And now I can watch her whenever I want to!
B00HTYTQ5A|5|Great new season in one of the best television has to offer. The character of Sherlock develops wonderfully and as always, the chemistry between Sherlock and John is unmatched. Add Mary to the mix, and the effect is spellbinding. Only negative is that we must wait another two years until our next fix.
1607747308|5|This book is amazing. I feel like I am on the road to a whole new me... a whole new life... and I love both.
B003M70O5O|5|The season starts with a lot of turmoil within the club as well as antagonists from without.  My husband and I can't wait to find out what happens from one episode to the next!
B002CIY8EM|5|We come across so many unexplainable things that it seems best not to look back. So keep your eyes toward the stars.
1416550550|5|Just completed this book.  Our book club meets in a few weeks and can hardly wait to start discussion on it.  This was a book that I was drawn back to reading, even if it was only a few pages at a time.  I would love to read more of the author's books.
B002BJGYTY|5|Awesome!
B009ZM7BEC|4|Enchanting.
B008IJTFYW|5|I really love this app, you can choose one, or a few different sounds to listen to together, so anyone that does not like and/or are not able to fall asleep with silence, there are plenty of options that you would undoubtedly find something that is most soothing for specifically you.
B005PK57IK|5|It's  like eating salty peanuts...you just HAVE to have another...and another. Great characters. Easy to follow. Fun plots. Just a good series.
B00ESNE696|5|Great acting.  Interesting subplots and character interactions.
B00000IAU3|5|I bought this CD for &quot;Here With Me&quot; and ended up liking all the other songs too. She's got an amazing voice and I listen to this cd constantly without getting tired of it. I wish I could change my travel  plans and catch her at the Troubadour in LA later this month!  If you like  Fiona Apple, Paula COle, Seal, Sarah M., etc, you WILL like this. Well  worth it.
B009UWYFFK|5|Funny, charming, great for kids and family!
B003ZYU3TG|5|Classic! Purchased as a gift for the Holidays for my daughter. She loved it and has watched it several times. Funny th think of her watching this classic which I so enjoyed as a youngster!
B00JOT3HQ2|5|AWESOME! This game will have your eyes glued to the screen. I do think the title makes it sound a little like a math game. The only way I found out is by accidentally clicking on the game.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|Love  this  game  great for when I take kids to the park and be able to check up on them. Each round takes about a minute or so to play. Earning tokens and coin have been easy to get so far. You don't have
B002QE3CTY|5|Soooo good. Must read
B000002A3T|5|People, this is one of those rare CD's in life where all the songs are amazing. A very well organised, multy-layered album, that sounds like its coming out of the 70's Floydian regime, and not the 90's. If this album  came out in 1971, no one would have noticed. Lovely album, and the missing  Waters influence isn't too obvious. And its better than THE  WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00288KNL8|5|one of the best stop action movies i have seen in a long time. Definately worth the purchase, especially when you can bring the 3D right in your into your home tv. Awesome movie that did get the time and attention it deserved
B002DCLQOW|5|I love Gilmore girls. Best show ever!
B00005QJDG|5|One of the 3 discs had a small imperfection that won't allow me to burn a copy of two songs on that one CD, but they play just fine, so I loved the purchase which I rated 5 STARS all the way! It's a great compilation and any DT fan should own it!
B00IINPXLW|5|Item exactly as described.Very fun to play.
0316212261|5|I bought the first book, Soulless, a while back, and was so delighted I knew I wanted to continue the series, so I decided to spring for the boxed set.  Overall you save money, rather than buying each book separately, and not only that, I was now able to give the individual copy of Soulless to my daughter, so she could enjoy it as well and get hooked on the series.  I just finished reading the second book, Changless, and this whole crazy universe only gets better!  Can't wait to see what else Ms. Carriger has in store for us!
B003R4ZMJU|5|A great show. I think first season is really good. DVD features are also good, I really liked first season.
0307120007|5|This book is wonderful for babies - a multisensory experience designed to entertain babies for many months. It is a good baby shower present.
B008JGSM6G|5|Completing an array in a few moves requires good spatial thinking. A nice pass time and a challenger, similar to minesweeper in requiring thought and planning to master.
B0000C9V3T|5|I love this Cd! is my favorite!, it combines since classic music and western to soul, it's fantastic!, i like &quot;Don't let me be misunderstood&quot;, &quot;Green Hornet&quot; and &quot;Battle without honor or humanity&quot;. I don't care that it hasn't  ALL the songs of the movie, but it got the bests. For the person that write in his review that &quot;Seven notes in Black&quot;, is not in the CD, better check out the titles behind your disk and you can see that &quot;Seven Notes in Black&quot; is the same song that &quot;Ode to Oren Ishi&quot;. Bye bye.
B003O86FMW|5|What can I say about this book but totally awesome!  I loved the description of the Quell arena and how each character plays their rolls withing the story.  Each page seemed to slip right by within seconds and it took me about 3-4 days to finish the book, only because the kids DEMANDED my attention!  ;)<br />I cannot wait to finish the 3rd book just to see how Katniss and all her allies turn out.
B006ZAZ31U|5|This heart rending, but a must read. This one of the most inspiring books I've ever read. Adam Brown would be proud of the message told.
1608198065|5|Roz Chast converts the supposedly sad subject of caring for aging parents with dementia into a surprisingly amusing, enjoyable read, and she does so without belittling the subject. Her tone and amusing cartoon figures, familiar to all New Yorker readers, can hold readers regardless of age. Whether seniors needing care, their children caring for them, someone expecting soon to be in either position, or simply someone hooked on the offbeat humor of Roz Chast--this book is ideal. Who said talking about dementia care must be unpleasant?
B0011HOEY4|4|I love this movie will watch a million times! It arrived before the date of arrival with both discs in the package!
B00IX9UTLU|5|If you loved 50 Shades of Grey , you'll love this!  I couldn't put it down.  Best .99 cents I've ever spent!!!
B00IIUATDM|1|The first scenes of the movie ruined any chance I'll ever see this. Seriously you perverts? What the crap?
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is so much fun! It's perfect for when you only have a few minutes here and there for playing a quick game
6305399212|5|i have seen aliens special edition about 50 times and i never get tired of it, the action the excitment it keeps you on your toes thoughout the whole movie..the performances awsome, i can't recommend this movie enough, now i got to go watch it again!
B00KW27K4K|5|Best. Movie. Ever. Tom cruise kicks ass in this. I've watched it 3 times since I bought it. Highly recommend.
B0086700CM|5|very good game even my grandkids like it. easy to use.grafics are good I would reccomend it.hard to put down
B006KX3GXO|4|This app is freakin COOL!!! Only thing I wish could be dif, I wish I could be able to sign up on the site to be able to get more stickers, effects n such...Sadly it says its only able to be done by aneroid useres for now n I'm on a Kindle Fire... :( I would LOVE to have more styles n frames too...hint hint...lmao
B005WUHAX8|1|It was cracked  We wentl for vacation  I told my daughter to return this  but I think she forgot. Nevertheless she never used this
B00003CXRM|2|If you are planning to have a nice night, with a good movie, I don't think you should pick 'O Brother Where Art Thou'.  Its pretty funny, but there was really no plot.  In one scene the 3 fugitives see these ladies who start singing and seducing them.  In my teenage perspective, I don't want to see some old dudes being seduced by beautiful women. (George Clooney is hot though)  I was laughing a lot of the time, but I did not understand this at all.  Every couple of minutes I was like, where did this dude come from? My mom and I were in tears we were laughing so hard after the movie was over, cuz we didn't get it AT ALL.  Especially the whole flood thing... if you just want a laugh without the annoyance of actual substance, then this is the movie for you!
B005MIYI3K|5|i finally got the album and i listened to the whole thing from begining to end, non-stop. all i have to say it \\"Tuomas, you've done it again.\\"  i'm in awe at the true genious of this man. i can't wait for the movie to come out now! i've been listening to Nightwish since the Tarja days, and i loved her too. but it's impossible for me to compare Anette to Tarja, they are just so different. and they are both so remarkably talented. it's almost like a new, different band. but i still love every second of it. as long as they always have Tuomas and the guys, Nightwish will never lose it's magic.  i honestly would find it extremely difficult to believe anyone could dislike this album, it's absolutely beautiful. definitely a must-buy! i would've gladly paid double what i did pay.
B00CSR2J9I|5|Is realistic because on mud pool it vehicle actually gets muddy and the game is just all around awesome! Make sure you save your money so you can get good vehicles.
B0084IG7KC|5|Loved it! This movie has the action, adventure, suspense, romance and everything. This makes me want to read all the books. Now that Harry Potter is over [which it will always be my # 1]...this is my new book/movie fad!
B00BP4Z8XY|5|Good movie. We all loved it.
B00K7C17QW|2|I like the game and the objectives, but disappointed in the rate to which you earn more energy or stars.  Definitely need to spend money on this game if you want to get any where!
B00004WGC4|5|then you may be dead. Or, maybe you've stayed at a bed and breakfast like The Fawlty Towers. John Cleese (Monty Python) plays Basil Fawlty, who along with his wife runs The Fawlty Towers. Basically, the entire series is an excuse to let Cleese do his patented slow-boil, get caught in compromising positions, and be mean to bellhop Manuel.<br />This is mean-spirited British humor at it's best. Cleese has rarely been better. And the supporting cast, lead by Connie Booth, is great. Stop in and see why this is one of the great comedies of all time.
B0002B15XI|5|great thank's
B00D3NSDVO|5|Excellent read
B00FRQ32N4|5|This game is awesome! It gets so addicting sometimes I rage quit. It's such an intense game and is like the movie.
B001BTG3OQ|3|I have two of these. I'm a wedding photographer and always have to be careful not to shoot too much, too fast and at high intensity or the flash will over heat. It's a Nikon thing with this flash as I have friends that have experience this problem. When the flash over heats it won't work until it cools down. Other than that it works good.
B00BD99JMW|4|An excellent way to compete the trilogy. I still believe that the first book was the best, but I still enjoyed reading this one. Like all the books, this one has twists and turns that made me want to read on. I couldn't put the book down! This is a good book for the 11-14 range ( possibly even higher ages) All in all, amazing series and can't wait for the movie to come out!
B00DPM7RJW|1|For the first time I'm not sure what to think about a book. I love her books but this one is strange.
B000002UAU|5|It goes without saying that Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is a widely regarded classic and one of the most influential and culturally affecting works-of-art of all time.  At the time of its release, Sgt. Pepper turned the music world on its ear and while the quality of this LP can be questioned and compared to other Beatles releases, none of them carry the historical significance that Sgt. Pepper does.  The mere range of styles on display is enough to make the album noteworthy but to add to that, the songs here are among the most memorable pop gems of all time.  From the \\"live,\\" rocking title track and its companion piece \\"With a Little Help From My Friends,\\" the perfect Ringo song, to the pure psychedelia of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and the clanging pop joy of \\"Getting Better,\\" The Beatles have already displayed more genius and sonic experimentation than most bands could ever dream of.  The most miraculous part is that all the various sounds and styles, from the straight rock n' roll of the theme song reprise to the circus themed \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,\\" don't clash when lined up together and never sound even the slightest bit pretentious.  The sonic collages that are so expertly assembled here sound effortless, as if The Beatles had been doing this since the beginning of time.  Case in point, the magnificent \\"A Day In The Life,\\" a two-part song (half Lennon, half McCartney) fused together by an apocalyptic orchestra to provide one of the most thrilling listens to be found in any genre of music.  With Sgt. Pepper, The Beatles opened up the world of rock to an infinite number of possibilities but since its release no one has been able to surpass Sgt. Pepper's fearless sense of exploration or amazing coherency, not even The Beatles.

0061122416|4|The book is a bit slow but it all makes sense as you go along. As each storyline/ lesson is unravelled in the book, manifestations in my own life was happening (strange I know). Good read, helps your psyche.
B007D2XSW0|5|so I got this when it was the free app of the day and if I may say so myself, WHAT A STEAL!! It is amazing! I love it so much and it is so easy to use! I get complements on all my edited photos :) love it &lt;3
B00BEZTMFY|5|Jackson and his crew did it again in this magical tale from Tolkein's epic tale.  A must see for any Lord of the Rings fan.  The special features disc is also well worth viewing.
0307269191|1|This acclaimed novelist has written a very shallow and sadly vacuous book about what he calls running. Really the book is a paean to the author's \\"iron will\\" (there's an attractive quality) and is likely a cash grab to trade on his fame. Runners will find little of use here - Murakami's ideas about training and tactics (even for a very modest athlete) are deficient and unproductive. His experiences, which are very smooth by most running standards, are uninspiring. He often sounds spoilt and peevish, and is consistently humourless. He seems to have little in the way of a family to assist him in his education about himself - to make him laugh or puncture his huge ego.  From a runner's point of view, however, the big disappointment is his lack of the true runner's experience - the beyond the world forgetting that comes with distance. My training tip? I think that he should take off his headphones and listen to himself.
B0088TG252|3|The world’s most-wanted double, no, triple agent just turned himself in. An ambitious CIA safe house watcher is tasked with keeping him safe until relief arrives. That’s no easy mission when he can’t trust anyone- not even himself.<br />Safe House: No one is Safe<br /><br />A shepherd needs to bring in a sheep that may be a wolf instead.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays counter-intelligence-super-spy Tobin Frost who has been selling secrets to every side for years. Ryan Reynolds (Green Lantern) stars opposite as the promotion-hungry CIA agent stuck in the dead-end job of watching over safe houses. In most movies, safe houses are places police and the FBI use to hide key witnesses that are unsafe anywhere else. In this arena, the safe house is an extraction point where individuals of interest are stored, interrogated and/or tortured if need be.<br /><br />This is a familiar role for Washington who taps in to his Alonzo from Training Day style to create a character that appears wholly evil, but possible a misunderstood shepherd in sheep’s clothing. It’s a solid film that creates an paranoid atmosphere of who’s out to get me and friend or foe at every turn. I give the movie extra credit for a nice turn that’s not a twist. You know what to expect: worthy interactions between characters, a few tightly done and suspenseful action sequences and a small moral question of how intelligently the intelligence branch of our government operates. Worth renting, but I wouldn’t add I to my collection at full price. I’m no movie critic; I’m just critiquing a movie.
B00009V7P8|4|Damien has a really cool voice that conveys a lot of emotion... some of the songs are kind of haunting in a good way. Some of it is a bit \\"folk-y\\" for me, but otherwise very much enjoy the album. Love the song from \\"Closer\\" which is why I purchased the album.
B0084AXZK0|5|I read this book years ago for a high school project and it is still such a great read.  I love this book and would read it a million times over.
B009NET0H8|5|I found this book contains some really wonderful street photography. Many of the photo's made by Vivian Maier are very high quality and I recommend this book!
B0083SBMBM|5|Great
B00005RHF8|2|I was so excited to see that this wonderful made-for-tv movie had been released on DVD.  What a horrible shock it was to see that the print the DVD was created from was in terrible condition.  Whole scenes are missing.  The dialog jumps around.  The screen goes completely black in the middle of a scene for a good three seconds.  There are scratch lines throughout the film.  <BR>The &quot;original&quot; film itself I give 5 stars (from memory).  The DVD -- doesn't deserve a single star.  Shame on the production company for not remastering this brilliant film.<BR>If you love Jane Eyre, these performances in this are well worth watching, but find a different copy.
B00EMJD6TC|3|When I heard this was being made I was pretty stoked since I had read two of Max Brook's books a few years before. I enjoyed the books because of the attempt at tying in the geopolitics. I know this is the movie and not the book, but it would have been nice to expand the story a bit to include some more of the interesting plots in the book. It seems that was the goal, with Pitt traveling to multiple locations but came up very short in the story department. Overall it was mostly exciting to watch, and if I ignore a few strange plot points (fasten your seatbelt?!), I think it is passable as a quality zombie flick. I just don't understand the purpose of buying the rights to WWZ and not putting any of it in the film.
B005FISBTO|5|I miss Dexter!! Great price.
B00NEQRNVG|3|really I think the last book # 4 should of been the last book all I got from four was a lot of arguing between the two for un necessary reason sure hope im not disappointed in the last one after I have invested so much time and money but I truly do love them both
B00COGY2P2|1|I was watching with my kids and we only got a quarter through the movie before i turned it off.  I didn't like it especially the senseless and shocking violence in the beginning. It wasn't exciting action. It was very dark for no reason. It should be Rated R.
B00PSLQGX6|5|A classic. Can't wait for Season 6...
B00EMGUT1I|3|I was really looking forward to hearing this new Motorhead CD.  There are a couple of rockin' songs but there are a lot of skippers.  A few a just a but to mellow for me.  I know Lemmy is getting up there in years and his music is starting to reflect that in my opinion.
B007IV1E2W|5|I loved every minute of season 6.  My favorite was everything River Song.  She and the Doctor are a riot together.  Smith and Kingston have such chemistry and it jumps right out of screen.
B004JK61K0|4|I am trying to use this app with my Kindle Fire and Charter Communications.  The app works great on my Kindle, but there is no way to sign out of the email and this causes a problem with Charter on my laptop.  It keeps telling me that the email is already in use and won't let me sign in.  I love this app for my Kindle, but I also need to use my laptop.  I have looked at the menu to see if there is a signout but can't find it.
B003OF3R0S|5|this is a very good cd and its in excellent condition i would recommend anyone to buy cd's from this dealer
B003YL4LYI|5|People tend to not give a feast for crows and a dance with dragons enough credit.  Granted a storm of swords was the best and my personal favorite in the series, but these books are great in their own right. A dance with dragons was more a set up for the coming winds of winter and a must read for a song of ice and fire fan.
B001BANK32|2|The first half of this novel consists of extraordinarily bad writing: commas are placed at random, syntax is butchered in the most sophomoric ways, and King reiterates every sentence at least three times. For instance--this isn't an actual quote; it's just my comic impersonation of the first half of The Shining: \\"Jack woke up with a splitting headache. Wow, it hurt like hell. Felt like he'd been hit, with a hammer or something. Except that he hadn't.\\" The worst of this stylistic redundancy is it mainly appears within streams of consciousness, and a stream of consciousness doesn't ordinarily second-guess itself--in fact it tends to be cryptic or esoteric. Anyway, the second half of this novel is somewhat better--stylistically--resulting in a distinct impression that either (a) parts of the novel may have been ghost written, or (b) Stephen King deliberately wrote the first half of The Shining in the most drawn out, crushingly redundant style he could manage, just so that later scenes might seem to move at a breakneck speed.<br /><br />That much said, nothing in this book was remotely scary--repeat: nothing. Here are some reasons (possibly including a few MILD SPOILERS for the novice) why Kubrick's movie is infinitely more satisfying to the viewer than is King's novel to a thoughtful reader:<br /><br />I. For starters, the movie has Nicholson. Of course, anyone who's already seen the movie will imagine that Book-Jack is Nicholson, too--but, it won't help much, because Book-Jack never speaks with that edgy charm.<br /><br />2. Book-Jack's mental life is steadily revealed in those stream-of-consciousness passages, while Movie-Jack's mind remains impenetrable. Therefore, Movie-Jack's mind can be a source of genuine horror in Kubrick's movie, whereas Book-Jack's mind provides mostly drudgery in Stephen King's book.<br /><br />3. The movie also has Duvall. And you can't pretend that Book-Wendy is Duvall, because, well, because book-Wendy is a blonde, for one thing, and....Well, that's about it: Book-Wendy isn't a fleshed-out character. She's a blond victim, she's a worried mom, but she's not much more.<br /><br />4. The movie has bent-finger, scratchy-voice Tony, while Book-Tony is not too much more than a state of mind. Whoever figured out how to make Movie-Tony visible and audible left Stephen King lying in the dust!<br /><br />5. The novel, despite a considerably larger cast of not very credible or interesting ghosts, seems to be more concerned with alcoholism than with anything ethereal.<br /><br />6. The novel doesn't have the hedge maze--which, of course, means the novel and the film have different endings. Without adding major spoilers, I can only say that the movie's ending is character-driven, while the novel's is more special-effectsy.<br /><br />7. The novel doesn't have \\"Here's Johnny!\\"<br /><br />8. The novel, despite its large population of ghosts, doesn't have those creepy little girls in it. (Nor does it have the waves of blood.)<br /><br />9. Book-Jack never once works on his manuscript at the Overlook. This of course means that the novel doesn't have \\"All work and no play...,\\" which again means that Book-Jack's madness isn't so impenetrable.<br /><br />10. In a nutshell, the mental anguish is more intense in the film; conversely, in the novel the physical violence is much more brutal.<br /><br />11. The act or facility of \\"shining\\" in the novel serves mainly to create suspense--that is, it allows the reader to know things that most characters in the novel do not know. Think here of Hitchcock's bomb-under-the-table: shining makes Book-Danny the kind of \\"camera\\" that offers the reader a less subjective--which is to say, more omniscient--point of view. Or in other words, shining lets Book-Danny know things that otherwise--without shining--only Stephen King himself could know. In the movie, most of that is brilliantly reversed: movie-shining serves as \\"proof,\\" within the film, of an alternate reality--or to put this another way, \\"shining\\" puts Movie-Danny slightly beyond the viewer's comprehension, which also puts Kubrick's cinematic \\"world\\" beyond our understanding, despite all the evidence presented to our eyes and ears. So, the novel can have a reality-affirming, reassuring conclusion, but the movie cannot.
B00003XB8K|3|Not exactly an Enigma album, but certainly a showcase for Michael Cretu's talent, &quot;Screen Behind The Mirror&quot;, is a romp through a drab electronic landscape, falling far short of what one might have expected  from Enigma (barring Le Roi Est Mort).  Obviously a fortune was spent on  gaining the rights for Orff's &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, as it appears in  no less than 4 tracks on the album; one totally gratuitously, and a second  time entirely unnecessarily.  It bogs down the otherwise redeeming  &quot;Gravity of Love&quot;, shifting focus from the mercifully  un-distorted sound of Sandra Cretu.  (One track is also a shameless rehash  of almost the entire first album)   Cretu, however, insists on flanging and  distorting almost every other bit of vocal talent in each track, ultimately  degrading the sound to high-pitched, echoed &quot;blahs&quot;.  Good luck  drawing anything out of the lyrics.   There seems to be little soul to this  album, although the cover art is littered with self-actualizing  admonishments.  It's good background music, but it isn't quite worth  listening intently to.  This latest release falls a distant second to a hot  cup of tea and an Anne Rice novel.<br />Bottom line:  If you like Enigma, buy  it, you'll probably like it anyways.  If you've never heard them before,  start with &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot;
B00CGYK9O0|5|These are a great idea to keep track of what you put in a jar.  Be warned, though, you need to remove them before you put your jars in the dishwasher as they will come off and be unusable.  I also think they would be a great idea for homemade gifts or throw a pack of them into your next wedding present.  If you have trouble writing with the chalk included, merely sharpen the chalk.
B00A9X9ORI|4|Interesting movie based on a person who goes to the future or the past and kills people. This guy now has to save his own life as he is sent to the past to kill his future self. And his solution, when he finds out that there is a conspiracy is to take care of the one thing which he can stop. Sweet concept, good movie that's not a remake!
B008MEM24S|5|I love this game so much. The puzzle of how to get the water from point A to point B is challenging and getting all of the gnomes is like a second challenge. I completed all the levels and then uninstalled just so I could reinstall and unlock all the levels and challenges all over again.

B00CKOYVG8|2|It is slow and it takes ten minutes to come up and when I restart a level it takes fifteen minutes to restart so it's not a fast game for internet.
B00D3NSDVO|5|I am Pilgrim is a flashback to tirelessly researched novels that are not only engrossing, but have that extra &#34;shiver&#34; factor that shows that the author has not only lived a full life, but has thought deeply about the journey.<br /><br />To me the details of the overriding terror plot were almost irrelevant. It could have been anything that &#34;Scott&#34; or &#34;The Pilgrim&#34; was solving. This was a journey for two men. One Western, one Eastern. The characters ruled, and that includes a brilliant supporting cast.<br /><br />This book, along with classics such as The Name of the Rose, shows once again that pace isn't everything. (I read it over three weeks). It reminded me that readers appreciate great writing and astute thought more than being whipped through by cheap devices and withheld information.<br /><br />I am Pilgrim is not flawless. It is, however, a great achievement, that I, as a writer in that genre, can only see as a raising of the bar. That's a good thing for all of us.<br /><br />Well worth your money.<br /><br />Greg Barron, author of Rotten Gods and Savage Tide
B00006LLNU|1|This album is not even mediocre- it's simply bad. After about three songs I just couldn't take it anymore. The high pitched distorted voices in the background have the same disturbing effect as a mosquito buzzing in your ear. The melodies are very plane and lack sophistication. It almost sounds like a child toying with a piano, repetitively playing the same four random keys. Don't buy it.
B00BEK6Z7M|5|Always look forward to a good Pendergast story and this was one of the best. A well thought out story.

144382657X|5|LLOYD GEORGE AN APPEASER?  BET YOUR FATHER DIDN’T KNOW THAT… OR YOUR GRANDFATHER EITHER!<br /><br />An Appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />We all know that great men have feet of clay.  But, as revealed in this extensively and meticulously researched historical study by Stella Rudman, Lloyd George managed to immerse himself deeper into the mire than many have been led to suppose.  Revelations about his womanizing have been legion, but apparently there’s a whole corpus of research material out there which indicates that he was, umm -- how shall we put it -- not entirely unsympathetic to one Adolf Hitler.<br /><br />Readable and absorbing, Rudman’s book focuses on a period in Lloyd George’s life which apparently has been largely overlooked by historians.  It does admirably what all doctoral studies should do and that is, explore avenues of enquiry where few if any other observers have ventured before, thus revealing truths hitherto only dimly perceived, or not perceived at all.<br /><br />The book focuses on that peculiar mind-set known as ‘appeasement’, as well as the character and attitudes of Lloyd George himself, who manifestly was an exponent of it. Although he never returned to office after 1922, Lloyd George remained something of a formidable force in British politics for another twenty years until his death in 1945.<br /><br />It does him no credit that he seems to have been only one of many in the British establishment at the time –even up to the outbreak of war in 1939 -- who thought Hitler wasn’t such a bad bloke really…that he had his reasons for his thinking and behaviour…that one could do business with him…etc. etc.ad nauseam. The name of Chamberlain crops up regularly here, as you might expect.<br /><br />All this is brought out in this quite fascinating book which resonates rather uncomfortably with the times in which we live now.  The following is literally one of hundreds of examples of the author’s research into her subject which shed light on Lloyd George’s innermost feelings regarding the bizarre and dysfunctional Hitler.  ‘I have never doubted the fundamental greatness of Adolf Hitler as a man, even in moments of profound disagreement with his policy.’ Lloyd George wrote in 1937.<br /><br />One wonders here how you can express ‘admiration’ -- Lloyd George’s word-- for someone in such rapturous terms when you are in ‘profound disagreement with his policy’.<br /><br />Through copious research, mainly into original source material as shown in the bibliography -- the author gradually reveals the psychology behind Lloyd George’s appeasement of Germany and examines its consequences during the crucial twenty-six year period of history covered in this book.  The results provide important insights into the many factors which can propel nations into war.<br /><br />Whether we learn any lessons from these events of the fairly recent past, only time and historical evaluation will tell!ds of examples of the author’s research into her subject which shed light on Lloyd George’s innermost feelings regarding the bizarre and dysfunctional Hitler.  ‘I have never doubted the fundamental greatness of Adolf Hitler as a man, even in moments of profound disagreement with his policy.’ Lloyd George wrote in 1937.<br /><br />One wonders here how you can express ‘admiration’ -- Lloyd George’s word-- for someone in such rapturous terms when you are in ‘profound disagreement with his policy’.<br /><br />Through copious research, mainly into original source material as shown in the bibliography -- the author gradually reveals the psychology behind Lloyd George’s appeasement of Germany and examines its consequences during the crucial twenty-six year period of history covered in this book.

B004J4WKUQ|5|I've read many of the one-star reviews, and I disagree with them.  Yes this is not Shakespeare' but neither are comic books, cartoons, sitcoms, and lots of other fun stuff.  I think this book was well written, entertaining, funny, and exciting.  The eighties references were spot on and set the mood consistently throughout.  I loved this book, but I also love most of the more serious sci-fi/fantasy authors mentioned in this book.  Apples and oranges.  The are both good.
B009ZZDNT6|4|This alarm app is very user-friendly and works well.  I would give it 5 stars if the alarm was louder.

B00005ABX0|4|After succumbing to the pressure of completing &quot;Smile&quot;, Brian Wilson shelved his unreleased masterpiece and released a hastily assembled mishmash entitled &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, and results for it were mixed at best.<br />&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; starts out strong with &quot;Heroes And Villians&quot;, the last great Brian Wilson - produced single. Next comes my first sticking point. &quot;Vegetables&quot;, though catchy, features workman - like production and rediculous lyrics that Al Jardine spouts out flawlessly among Paul McCartney's carrot - chomping. Next comes the odd but good &quot;Fall Breaks And Back To Winter (W. Woodpecker Symphony)&quot;, followed by the laughably bad &quot;She's Goin' Bald&quot; features terrible vocals and is so awful that by the time you get to the really high &quot;sha -na - na&quot; part, you're hoping the album's already over. As for the rest of the album, &quot;Little Pad&quot; is a musical pot party, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; really doesn't need any explanation (c'mon you know it's great), &quot;With Me Tonight&quot; features lovely harmonies, &quot;Gettin' Hungry&quot; is a nice rocker, &quot;Wonderful&quot; and &quot;Wind Chimes&quot; are pale imitations of the &quot;Smile&quot; version, and there isn't much to say about &quot;Whistle In&quot;.<br />The follow - up to &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, &quot;Wild Honey&quot; is an excellent album featuring The Beach Boys doing R &amp; B - style music. It kicks off full - throttle with the title track, a sweltering rocker featuring a raucous Carl Wilson lead vocal. Following that is the R &amp; B thump of &quot;Aren't You Glad&quot; followed by a superb cover of Stevie Wonder's &quot;I Was Made To Love Her&quot; with a flawless Carl handling the lead. &quot;Country Air&quot; has beautiful harmonies, and &quot;A Thing Or Two&quot; is a nice ditty. The band then tears into the classic &quot;Darlin'&quot;. Featuring a hot Carl vocal and soulful horns, this song is truly a classic. Next comes &quot;I'd Love Just Once To See You&quot; (featuring a hilarious lyrical surprise on the tag, courtesy of Brian). After that comes the sensual groove of &quot;Here Comes The Night&quot;. Next is the eerie &quot;Let The Wind Blow&quot;. &quot;How She Boogalooed It&quot; follows and is very energetic with its speedy tempo. Next comes &quot;Mama Says&quot;, an outtake from the &quot;Smile&quot; version of &quot;Vegetables&quot; that has sweet harmonies.<br />There are a couple of bonus tracks added. First, there's an excellent alternate version of &quot;Heroes And Villians&quot; that features entirely different from the version that was released. Next coms some session highlights from the &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; sessions, followed by an alternate take of the song featuring Brian singing entirely different lyrics from ther version that was released. &quot;You're Welcome&quot; is nothing more than a chant. Next is the rel keeper. &quot;Their Hearts Were Full Of Spring&quot; is an old Four Freshmen song. This version is from rehearsals for a show in Hawaii, and the harmonies are so beautiful you'd think angels are singing it. Next comes the unreleased masterwork &quot;Can't Wait Too Long&quot;/Been Way Too Long&quot;. It is an absolutely brilliant piece of music that should be heard by every Beach Boys fan.<br />I suggest you go out and purchase this cd. It not among their best, but the music on here is ll very interesting and at some points, excellent. So make this the next Beach Boys album you purchase.

0061922315|5|The loss of a child takes varied forms, but each is a cause of unspeakable grief and heartache.  The Secret Daughter enlightens us about a place and a culture that might be unfamiliar to some readers, but the essence of the story is that loss, whether it comes as a result of miscarriage, sacrifice, or life decisions.  But I was not left with a sense of hopelessness, rather just the opposite.  The author handles all this with great skill and a style that kept me involved with the characters and their story to the very end.<br />I encourage anyone who likes engaging fiction with a chance to learn something about India and its culture to read this one: it will stay with you long after you finish the last page.
B0034G4P8A|3|I thought this movie was ok. Way better than Captain America though. The effects were top notch, and you can expect nothing less from a Marvel movie these days. Substance not so much though. Any way, could have saved myself $24 and just rented it. As a movie collector I like to buy movies that I can watch over and over again. This is probably going to collect dust on my rack.

B0051OZ564|5|Great action, great music, entertaining, authentic, the cast really connected with their roles, uniquely artistic, kind of soulful.  Felt quite original.  My artistic takehome was the aformentioned combined with an excellent metaphor for the human condition, suffering, and the struggle for freedom.

0790729989|4|This isn't going to have a happy ending.<br />Tough thriller with an incredible climax. Exceptionally written, and well-acted thriller but not for the timid. 7 is very unsettling and dark at times. The Plot:  Police drama about two cops (Freeman and Pitt), one new and one about to retire,  after a serial killer using the seven deadly sins as his MO. <br />Favorite  line: Detective David Mills (Pitt): I've been trying to figure something in  my head, and maybe you can  help me out, yeah? When a person is insane, as  you clearly are, do you know that you're insane? Maybe you're just sitting  around, reading &quot;Guns ammo ...Wow! It is amazing how crazy I really  am!&quot;? Yeah. Do you guys do that?<br />The DVD:  Outstanding  image  quality.  Shadowy and intentionally dark; images are sharp and detailed.  The Dolby® Digital soundtrack delivers excellent sound.
0143038419|5|I loved the book.  I loved that she shared her \\"breaking loose\\" story despite it not being a pretty tale.<br /><br />What I didn't like is that she didn't seem to adequately, IMO, own the carnage she left behind, nor did she devote much ink to any valiant effort to be accountable for what she did.<br /><br />If you divorce someone who doesn't want to divorce you, yes, you eff up their lives since they are at least for a while going to be worse off seeing their investment & commitment (the marriage) go to hell. Still, it may need to be done.  But if you have to do it hopefully you will allow yourself to feel fully remorseful, to express the remorse, and to try to introduce some repair by being accountable to the other person (this could be money, it could be simple acknowledgement and acceptance of responsiblity and begging forgiveness, etc.)<br /><br />I do hope she gave her ex a bucketload of money once she became rich and famous as a reparation.<br /><br />Still, her journey is worth reading and learning from.  If it would have been great if it were instead Eat, Pray, Pay Back, Love -- but that's not as sexy a title is it?  If she had been more remorseful and if that remorse would have gone more towards her husband instead of towards her own feelings of wretchedness, I suspect that many put-off readers would have been much more understanding.<br /><br />And still others will judge Gilbert no matter what she does, because in their minds any woman who is middle class and who has a husband who doesn't want to leave her has no business being unhappy.
B00AREIAI8|5|I truly like. This game , It does have a few problems ,of losing your coins gems and levels,but they are trying to fix it, you can go to support as tell them, and suggest things. As be careful on gems to buy things gems is harder to earn,buying gems as coins does require real money but enjoy the game and befriend lots of people,they help you as you help them.

B0044DEAUA|5|I can NOT do without this!!!!  Amazing sound, great functionality, and positioned right by head so good sound for you and the person you are talking to.  I use mine daily and have had it for over a year and the batter still lasts 30+ days.  It is so much safer than talking on your handset.  I use with my iPhone's and love I can connect more than 1 to it. Also, green button connects you to Siri so you can call, text, and get directions just like holding phone.  The ONLY problem is that when at home and car is in garage it can remain connected and cause you to miss calls. I just got in the habit of pressing button and turning Bluetooth off when I get home.  I have bought 2 people this as a gift!
B002APU580|5|Love how the english speak and carry themselves. this movie helps one to go back in time and understand how their traditions about life and a the role of women was portrayed. The romatic tension between the two was a little to dramatic or more intense than it should have been but Keira Knightly played this role great. One of her best roles.
B001EOOQEC|4|I don't care what anyone says- the fact that Dio came back to Sabbath for this album DOES increase the quality of the songwriting, if only a little bit, at least it's better than many of those generic mid to late 80's albums Sabbath was pumping out.     One thing I find very odd about Dehumanizer is how the songs feel completely out of order.  The opening song is STRANGE.  Oh sure, it has an extremely heavy Sabbath riff, but it doesn't sound right when combined with Dio's vocals.  I think Dio is off here with his legendary vocal style, despite the song being very enjoyable anyway.    Some other moments on the album resemble the Holy Diver days of Dio (you know, the classic years).  Actually, while the album goes on, each song gradually shifts into a direction that more resembles Dio than anything Black Sabbath has done.   I noticed by the final track the album felt more like a solo Dio album than a Sabbath album.      Also, I like this album more than the music Ozzy was creating around this time.  Just throwing that out there :)    Honestly, I found myself enjoying most of the songs from this album.  A few generic moments aside maybe, but nothing TOO overwhelming to be concerned about.    To sum it up- Dehumanizer is no classic Black Sabbath album, and I believe Mob Rules was the last classic album the band ever made, but it's still a pretty good album that Sabbath and Dio fans should try out to see if they like.  I think they WILL like it.
B00F91H666|4|It was better than I expected.  I liked the occasional humor as well as the slightly different view on the zombie virus/epidemic that many movies take.
B00006AG5N|5|Elvis was definately one of the founders of rock 'n' roll. The talent in his versitility and determination makes me happy. The songs touch my heart and it makes me want to dance (which you don't want to see, I'm a pathetic dancer). I say we go into every house in America, rip out any music that isn't rock and put in this Elvis album. If we did this, everyone would realize that this is the greatest music there ever was. All music started going down hill when rap started becming popular. Rock never died, it just hid for a while, I say we need more rock bands, but it may not happen. So until that happens buy this CD and others of music like this and it may someday happen.

039916927X|3|The only reason I give it three stars is because there is a little bit of language that I didn't care for. Otherwise a good book.
B00005MP58|5|While this is quite a bit longer than any movie (for it is a television mini-series), it was done so well! Plus, any British television lovers would find this very agreeable.
B003VANOFY|5|love this headset so far. fits nicely over ears and blocks lot of external sound out. the audio is quite clear and works well, so far the wireless connection has been working fine although once in a while it does disconnect and reconnect although its been fairly rare. you can charge and use it at the same time and the cord it comes with is long enough to move about without disturbing the receiver. the microphone works great over skype haven't had any problems overall a great headset would recommend if it's on sale
B00BVYTB1I|5|Super fun and cute. Captures the weirdness of high school perfectly. Ashley Rickards nails it as a teen girl trying to fit in and find self confidence while navigating the clicks and mean girls at her high school. Well written and acted. Recommended.
B00MJD7AMC|5|Amazing and captivating book.  Highly recommend
B00K3N5RWK|5|Good game.  I've seen a lot of the same structure in Kings Bounty.  A hexagonal board is always a better design for strategy games.  You can take 3 to 6 hours to find the grail.  And then start another, and the grail is in another location. The screen is easy to decipher.  I have run into no glitches.  As others have mentioned, you need to gather troops early.  But even with that warning, you willcome up short.  But since you can learn things during your first game, you apply what you have learned on your next game.

B00BVYLBP2|5|What a great series! It has it all! Character development, great story line, talented acting, humor, mystery, conspiracies, and wittiness.  Where most shows fizzle as the seasons continue, this show carries on strong.  Tatiana Maslany is so gifted, you either forget she performs each person or watch with wonderment when you realize it's all her.

The more often u play the more u feel challenged.  It is lots of fun, try it but give it a fair chance to hook u in.

B00FAVRHBE|5|Based on his writing for television, one imagines that Steven Moffat's enjoys puzzles in whatever spare time his professional commitments allow. On the sitcom Coupling, Moffat showed a great affinity for making seemingly disparate pieces come together into a satisfying whole, often by playing around with time. Not surprisingly, this approach has been even more thoroughly explored in his writing for Doctor Who.<br /><br />Following his relatively straightforward first story* with the &#34;empty child&#34;, Moffat has taken the time travel aspect of the show and run with it like no other writer in Doctor Who's 50 year history. From his first script for David Tennant's Doctor to the overarching story-lines of his time as the show's lead writer, time has been a key element of the narrative puzzles he's assembled. This was true even of the 2007 mini-episode &#34;Time Crash&#34;, produced for the BBC's Children in Need charity event, which presented a brief meeting between David Tennant's Doctor and his 1980s predecessor, Peter Davison.<br /><br />In some ways that brief interlude was good practice for yesterday's special episode for the show's 50th anniversary, &#34;Day of the Doctor&#34;. Having the current Doctor meet his former selves was done to mark both the 10th and 20th anniversaries of the show and, despite the show not being on TV at the time, the 30th and 40th as well^. This precedent of celebrating the past in a way virtually no other show can added a particularly tricky piece to the puzzle, because while these stories had their moments none could be classified as one of Doctor Who's finest hours.<br />After an uneven run of stories that culminated in &#34;The Name of the Doctor&#34;, I had my doubts as to how well Moffat would succeed at crafting a puzzle whose pieces included…<br /><br />-celebrating Doctor Who's past in a way longtime fans would appreciate but didn't require decades worth of background knowledge for everyone else to enjoy.<br />-displaying the fun parts of multi-Doctor stories without succumbing to the pitfalls that made previous ones less than great.<br />-fostering optimism about a 60th anniversary (and beyond).<br /><br />My doubts gave way to anticipation a little over a week before &#34;Day of the Doctor&#34; aired, thanks to one of two prequels that had been announced for the story. What made &#34;Night of the Doctor&#34; so good was not that it gave longtime fans like myself what we wanted, particularly a return appearance as the Doctor by Paul McGann, but rather that it did so in unexpected ways. In a little under seven minutes, Moffat managed to subvert our assumptions about some key elements of the show's mythology while also telling a sharply written story about gut-wrenching choices. It also helped explain how John Hurt as the mysterious &#34;War Doctor&#34; fits into the larger story.<br /><br />The idea of a missing incarnation seemed to annoy a lot of hardcore fans, especially when it was announced that none of the show's pre-2005 Doctors would be in the anniversary episode. Despite three of those actors being dead and none of the others except McGann and (to a lesser extent) Davison looking much like they did when they were the current Doctor, an awful lot of these &#34;fans&#34; prejudged the story as a disappointment solely based on Tennant being the only established past Doctor in it. This attitude is amusing in retrospect because it was having John Hurt as this newly revealed Doctor that made the multi-Doctor element work in a way that I can't envision any of Tennant's and Smith's predecessors doing.<br /><br />Because he represented a shadowy period in the Doctor's story before the one that started with Christopher Eccleston's Doctor in &#34;Rose&#34;, Hurt was able to embody the Doctor's entire past. On the one hand, his jabs at Tennant and Smith harkened back to William Hartnell putting his successors in line in &#34;The Three Doctors&#34;, but he also personified the tensionbetween who the Doctor was, who he's become and who he should be. More to the point, having an actor of Hurt's calibre seemed to push Tennant and especially Smith out of their comfort zones. The end result is that a story that could have been a shallow and incoherent mess feels believable on a character level, which enabled me to enjoy the icing on the cake all the more.<br /><br />Admittedly, not all of the icing was to my taste. The war scenes on Gallifrey felt a bit too &#34;Star Wars&#34; for my liking, presumably intended to give more 3-D bang for the buck (or rather quid), but the return of the Zygons and seeing UNIT led by Kate Lethbridge-Stewart was great fun. Needless to say, it was also fantastic to see that the line about no pre-2005 Doctors appearing wasn't quite true either, and seeing a glimpse of incoming Doctor Peter Capaldi was a terrific touch.<br /><br />And then there's an element that's simply beyond objective assessment for a fan of my generation, Tom Baker.<br />Baker declined to appear in the 20th anniversary story &#34;The Five Doctors&#34;, in which he was only seen in footage from &#34;Shada&#34;. Coming just two years after the end of his 7 year run as the Doctor, that decision wasn't surprising, though, Baker later said he regretted it and in recent years seems to have re-embraced Doctor Who. Seeing him as the museum curator who may or may not be another version of the Doctor may not have made total sense but here again on the level of character it worked, providing that elusive piece of the puzzle whose final form looks even cooler than you imagined.<br /><br />-----<br />*Technically, Moffat's first script for Doctor Who was a 1999 charity sketch called &#34;The Curse of the Fatal Death&#34; starring Rowan Atkinson as the Doctor and Jonathan Pryce as the Master. Like all the best parodies, it also worked as a good example of the thing it was spoofing.<br />^There a lot I could write quite a bit about both the 1993 Doctor Who/Eastenders crossover &#34;Dimensions in Time&#34; and the audio drama &#34;Zagreus&#34;, but I'll leave it at saying that both were done in good spirit but neither is especially good.between who the Doctor was, who he's become and who he should be.

B00064MW6A|1|When I first learned of the movie Catwoman, I heard that the public reception towards the first trailers - where Halle Berry, who plays the main character, hisses at some barking dogs - were so bad that Warner studios had to release new trailers without this scene that made moviegoers laugh. Now I am not sure if everybody who saw those trailers did laugh, but I am certain that everyone knew that the movie would have a rough ride at its release. Especially when they had to reshoot a whole new ending for the pre-screening reactions were bad. However, the end result was that the public, the critics, and certain actors like Halle Berry herself, admitted the movie was awful.<br /><br />At the time of the release many critics have been thrown at Pitof, the movie director, and have blamed him for the film's failure. However, I think that movie's main mistake was that it was caught in a Development Hell that went for twelve years, in which the project switched writers so many times that the original story, a sequel to Batman Returns ending that Daniel Waters wrote, became something else. And by that I mean a derivative story where an intimidated graphic designer working for two unpleasant Cosmetic company bosses, drown and become a woman-cat entity who takes the identity of Catwoman while wearing a costume that made her more ridiculous than dangerous.<br /><br />About the actors, I can say that everyone in the cast gave their best with what they got, but I wonder if they all knew, and the director to an extent, that the movie would flop at its release. Especially with a script that has awful one-liners, funny scenes at moments when it shouldn't be so, and a more or less ridiculous villain in the form of a Cosmetic Company. As such, the movie follows some of the same origins that Michelle Pfeiffer had in Batman Returns, but does it in a more ridiculous way that one wonders what would have happened if the movie had been done with Daniel Waters' original script.<br /><br />About the director, of which I saw his first feature Vidocq, it was evident that he is more at ease working through visual effects and camera shots since this is where he first started his movie career, such as some of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's works. There are some nice shots that I liked such as the accelerated day workday in the artists' office as we see Halle Berry coworkers leaving while she finishes her artwork late at night. But in general, it was too easy to see when the computerized version of Halle Berry did her stunts and when the real actress was on set. During this movie experience, I had the feeling that the production was rushed and it hurt the movie's effects. Not only that, Pitof has the annoying habit of switching angles every three seconds, and that becomes a headache to watch even on a small TV screen. So imagine the people that had to watch it in a movie theater's giant screen. Maybe that was one of the reasons why they had to cancel all the IMAX release they intended to do in 3D, apart from a probably rushed post-production schedule.<br /><br />Of the soundtrack, I found it very irritating as it tried to make itself cool, but instead made me laugh for the wrong reasons, at scenes that could have been more dramatic such as Catwoman's rebirth, her final fight with her boss's wife, and her first costume dress-up as she puts herself some makeup and cuts her hair everywhere. And with the way she does it, it's a wonder she didn't cut her ears or gouged her eyes.<br /><br />In the end, I think this movie experience hurt the character's chance of success in any movie done without Batman's presence, and the only way it could have been saved was if the artists involved had done their movie with a better script.ut the director, of which I saw his first feature Vidocq, it was evident that he is more at ease working through visual effects and camera shots since this is where he first started his movie career, such as some of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's works.

B001383XT8|3|I bought this pedal as a first distortion pedal. it was great for the first few weeks, nice tones. When i bought it, there were two in the amazon box, so i got one free, tested both of them. After a few weeks, the distortion itself broke. both of them became really fuzzy and thick, not like the tones i had before. Basically, i only use this pedal as a fuzz pedal with the Metal setting on my Line 6 Spider IV 15 watt amp.

B003XF1XOQ|3|I am glad I didn't pay to read this book.  It was very good until the end.  Geesh...what a let down.  I believe the ending of this book mirrored how our current government treats its soldiers.  Those brave men and women fight for us, die for us and what does our government do? It brings them home and ignores them.  Disgraceful.  Do not expect a happy ending.  I am very curious to see how Hollyweird treats this last movie.  NOT looking forward to seeing it.

B000LTAY1U|5|This is a solidly built mechanical watch. It has been called an &#34;Honest&#34; watch because it is a solidly built, unpretentious, undervalued watch. Well worth your money at the $67 I paid for mine. Well worth your money at $100. You will not find a real mechanical this good under $300.  An understated classic. Be aware that it attracts a cult following in the watch world...<br />Also the fit and finish are excellent, and the Hardlex crystal can take a lot of abuse - much more than any other mineral crystal. I have whacked mine against a certain sharp steel door handle more times than I am proud of and not a single scratch.
0060536357|5|...-F. Ross Johnson, President & Chief Executive, RJR Nabisco<br /><br />That phrase dots Burrough and Helyar's work - mentioned several times throughout the course of the book- and encapsulates the kind of colorful nonfictional story-telling that's at it's best here. The authors do a masterful job of telling a story about what was the biggest business deal in history and the complexity of the big personalities, big egos, big fees and big everything that encompassed it. From Forstman Little's Crusade Against Junk Bonds (caps intended), to First Boston's out-of-nowhere bid that inevitably set up the KKR win, this book is filled with an abyss of unputdownable plots and subplots that leaves one edu-tained from start to finish.<br /><br />One of the best things about this book is how effectually the authors try to get inside the heads of the players and mini-players in a manner that adds both color to the story telling and insight into the deal. Like this passage:<br /><br />\\"Around eleven o'clock they were joined by Matthew Rosen, the team's thirty-six-year-old tax counsel.  Rosen was a lawyer from the 'Thirtysome-thing' crowd: Italian suits, tassled loafers, an office crammed with modern-art [Kandisky likenesses I hear my mind wondering as a reader?], the kind of early 1970s rabble-rouser embarrassed to tell his Swarthmore class reunion he now made millions sniffing out tax loopholes for corporate takeovers\\".<br /><br />Some educational takeaways include the role of junk bonds, the intricacies as well as benefits/costs of LBOs with the help of management (i.e. friendly) vs. hostile takeovers, moral hazard/conflicts of interest issues involving banks and financial advisors, the crucial role of good valuation work and thorough due diligence, managing public relations, deal confidentiality, managing Board of Directors relations, information security and bid strategy.  Will one be ready to enact one's first billion dollar LBO after completing this book? Not yet. I would Rick Rikerten's Book \\"Buyout: The Insider's Guide to Buying Your Own Company\\" if you are looking to gain practical insight on more compact deals for that.<br /><br />A book I came across entitled, \\"The New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation of Corporate Value\\" by George Baker and George Davis Smith would also complement the reading of Burrough's and Helyar's book quite well.

0385334206|4|Kurt Vonnegut, in the Preface to this book, says \\"This book is my fiftieth birthday present to myself.\\"  The result is a novel which is a little lighter, a little less focused, and a little more witty than his other novels.  One of the main characters of this novel is Kilgore Trout, a struggling (in fact, failed) writer who can only get his stories and novels published as filler for pornographic magazines and books.  Anyone who has read Slaughterhouse Five by Vonnegut will recognize Trout's name--the main character of that novel, Billy Pilgrim, spends some time in a hospital next to a man (Eliot Rosewater) who is Trout's ONLY fan, and who has a private collection of Trout's work which is larger than the one Trout himself has.<BR> <BR>Trout makes his appearance in this book when he departs for an arts festival in a small town called Midland City.  There his path crosses with Dwayne Hoover, a car dealer who is already a little off his rocker and is soon to be made completely insane by Trout's writings, which he takes seriously.  Though this was not my favorite of Vonnegut's novels, and though I did not enjoy the story as much as some of his other works, I could not help enjoying this book.  Vonnegut is a superb writer, a true master of his craft.  The drawings he includes are funny and add to the overall satirical effect of the book.  Vonnegut perhaps included that part about the book being a birthday present so it wouldn't be taken as seriously as some of his other novels.  I think the best part of this book is that it seems like Vonnegut wrote it just for the sake of writing, and that he didn't care what anyone would think of it. Breakfast of Champions certainly is not the masterpiece that Slaughterhouse Five or Cat's Cradle are, but it is nevertheless a very entertaining read.
B003F3FJQO|4|Upon starting this book, I could not put it down!  There were lots of twists and turns and a problem to solve at every turn.  If you liked book one then you should read this one.
0743455967|5|When one of the best selling authors writes a book \\"on writing\\" you make it a part of your collection.  Stephen King is a name synonymous with fictional horror writing.  But he also wrote a non-fiction book \\"On Writing\\" published in 2000. I had to read it. I was not disappointed.<br /><br /> \\"On Writing\\" is part memoir and part how I write.  It is delivered in Stephen King opinionated style as only he can write it.  Stephen King gives tidbits of his life before hitting it \\"big\\" and actually getting paid to write.  I did notice a lot of beer was included in his early years. Tall boys and writing what a combination! It is nice to read about a very successful author and how it all started for him. They called him Stevie back in those days, but today he is Mr. King. Well, Stephen anyway.<br /><br />  Stephen King started writing this book in December of 1997. It was published in 2000.  For him it was a long process.  He had to put it in a drawer to hide or marinate, which is not a bad thing he explains. There was a well-documented accident in 1999. Stephen writes what he accounts about the accident. (What he remembers anyway.) I say he is a lucky, lucky man. Stephen's writing account about this accident is well worth the price of the book.<br /><br />  Stephen King gives plenty of his opinion on other authors. Good and bad. But gives the reasons why he feels so.  \\"Great authors are not made, but born\\" Stephen says.  Good authors can be made, like himself.  I think he categorizes himself in the good section.<br /><br />  The majority of his writing process is credited to William Strunk's \\"Elements of Style.\\" Translated with these statements, \\"The adverb is not your friend\\" and \\"It's always about the story.\\" These statements are interjected into many sections of the book. Writer wannabes can take heed to many of his writing habits, I said slowly.<br /><br />  Stephen compares his process of writing to a toolbox.  There are many levels in this toolbox. Drawers can be taken out and interchanged. But there should be at least four levels to your toolbox.  The top levels include vocabulary and grammar. Style is next. The next levels could include pace, narration, description and dialogue. And many more levels, depending on the author's need. Stephen gives his view on each of these levels. You ask, what about plot? Well, Stephen's opinion on plot is included in the book. Like his novels, I can't give it all away in one review or book!<br /><br />The most important advice, \\"Read a lot, write a lot.\\"awers can be taken out and interchanged.

B00JND1LQW|5|This is a well-designed game.  It's not the style I would usually play, but I decided to give it a chance. I highly recommend it. It's pretty fun.
B0054JZC6E|4|I'm always the last one off the bus and i get really bored but this passes time and me and my friend both try to best the challenging levels! its fun!
B002VPE1WK|5|As described
B00003CXXP|5|This movie sparkles gorgeously with breath-taking special effects, wonderful performances, and a soundtrack to blow your socks off.  It was absolutely the best movie I have ever seen.  Haley shined in his role as a remarkably life-like robot child who gets attached to his &quot;mother&quot; after she reads the magic words which are only to be spoken when you plan to keep your child forever.  Packed full of priceless childhood wonder, like a winding fairy-tale with a joyful reunion as the ending.  Perfect in every way, complete.  The soft background music, composed by John Williams adds a wonderful delicate frosting to the cake.  If you want a movie that will keep you watching it again and again, falling in love with it every time, or even one to let out a tear or two, this movie would be the greatest addition to any collection.  I whole-heartedly recommend it.
B00EAI9CSY|5|Great movie, great story, great cast! \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" all over again! Saoirse Ronan was scary and lovely at the same time.
B0094MB298|4|Pretty funny movie, with Cameron Diaz starring. I think I had this teacher...
B0063IH60K|2|You get what you pay for.  Who ever heard of a guaranteed &#34;win&#34;?<br />Doesn't come close to my iPad game.
B00I8H6MGS|5|Gripping true story.  Well casted and amazing performances by all!  An intelligent movie that makes you think about our prejudices and our pharmaceutical industry.
1781162646|5|Joyland was deffinitely a different kind of Stephen King book.  I didn't once worry about reading it alone at night.  In face, there wasn't much that COULDN'T  have happened......if you belileve in the spirit world.
B006K2WXOI|5|A Christmas classic!!!
B009UX2YAC|4|I love this game the only thing that I don't like  is how it continues running I wish it would go to a different level like running in  different location
B00IYOACQ6|5|I like this one even better than the first two. You have to think and observe to figure out at least one step in each scene. If you remember how you figured out past scenes, you can use those methods to figure out the one you are on. GREAT FUN!!! Are there any more?
0307454541|5|Salander, the transcendent female character created by Steig Larson, is a breakthrough for female literary protagonists.  What's more - she's really fun to read about.  Larson tells an compelling story in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  The story is set in Sweden amidst the financial & magazine publishing world.  Blomkvist, a most likable reporter, has been recently busted for a journalist no-no.  Apparently, he wrote an article full of charges against a formidable company that he simply can not prove.  In his despair, he takes an unlikely job, working for the head of a major corporation who wants Blomkvist to write his family's memoirs as a ruse to uncovering some family secrets long since buried.<br /><br />As Blomkvist starts to make progress on the mystery, upsetting the extended family in the process, and finds himself in need of the very specific skills of Salander.  They meet, they work together and they tussle a bit.  Read the book to see how this unlikely pair attempt to solve the mystery and turn their own personal and professional lives around in the process.<br /><br />The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is perfectly paced and painstakingly developed mystery complete with suspense and romance.  You are going to love it.  Luckily the Salander character makes a reappearance in Larson next two books.  Lucky us!
B00ADS98FC|5|Great movie. It is funny and cute. I can not wait until the second one comes out in 2015 :)

B0007Y4TVU|4|Well, I've done a pretty thorough perusal of the reviews placed on this board, and I'm astounded (but not surprised) by the amount of people that have missed the point on this album.  I'll lay it out for those of you who didn't get it. <br /> <br />System of a Down uses a literary tool called irony in their songs, and for those of you who have blatantly criticized the chorus of \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" for being too much like a boy-band song, you missed it.  SOAD isn't advocating that type of lifestyle, they are criticizing it through the use of sarcasm!  Also, for those who call SOAD hypocritical for being anti-establishment and anti-celebrity and yet live in California, allow me to present this point to you: what better way to change the things you need to change than by diving into the belly of the beast? <br /> <br />I don't think SOAD is the greatest metal band ever, but they are necessary!  They are political, but not preachy, and this type of artistic expression is needed.  Besides, no one takes U2 seriously anymore, so we need someone to take over.  I think this album is great because you have to think about what the lyrics mean.  I'm sorry that SOAD didn't spoonfeed a bunch of grunts and growls to some of the reviewers, but it's called \\"growth\\" and SOAD is doing just that.  Serj alone makes this band worth experiencing.  This guy can do more things with his voice than Martha Stewart can do with a potato peeler.
1400049628|5|This book was really funny. Even though it's about a fictional subject it's logically written. I would like to see the other zombie books by this author.
B00AQ3K8IU|4|Loved it! I couldn't put it down. Holder has all the right words and I loved Sky. Not once did I want to scream at these characters. Usually lead characters make me want to scream at them but not here.<br /><br />I'm really loving Colleen Hoover as an author.

B00J2PEZAU|1|Slow and boring. Could not get past the first 20 minutes. The best parts are highlighted in the trailer. Very disappointing.
B0001GOH6Q|5|The story about the father/son relationship is a great one.  My father had many stories and I am sure they were quite embelished.  We take away what we want to and as they say, leave the rest.

B00BQPEIT2|5|This app is nothing but fun. I could spend hours on it. It's so amazing it's hard not to procrastinate. I am so amazed at the graphics.
B00CTKHXFO|3|Metal Gear Solid (ps1 game) is not physically included in this box, but rather, a download voucher for the game is included in this package. Now, the problem here is that, this voucher will NEVER work unless you log into PSN from your PS3 using a US account. For a region free console, I never expected that buying a US region game will cause issues on my European PS3 (Linked to a European PSN account), but it did.<br /><br />Luckily, you can bypass this issue by creating a fake US account (no credit info needed), and entering the voucher from there. You can still play the game even after you log back in from your original account. Sadly, I couldn't make use of this on my PS Vita, as it is only limited to 1 account per device :(  ....<br /><br />The included art book isn't something to look forward to, to be honest.<br /><br />This still deserves at least 3 stars because the games are still solid and awesome!
1451627289|4|Captivating story and intriguing.  But sometimes I have a problem keeping my interest when I find factual errors.  Oh, nothing of note and nothing that affects the story.  I realize that sports are not King's forte, but certain errors are a bit distracting.  He refers to The Dallas Texans as a team that will eventually become \\"America's team\\" aka The Dallas Cowboys..uh, The Texans moved from Big D and became The Kansas City Chiefs..at the time that the story supposedly took place Dallas had two teams.  A bookie tells him to bet on the Bears to win the NFC.  Uh, the NFC did not exist in 1963..it came about in 1970 as a result of the AFL/NFL merger.  He mentions a basketball team called the Dallas Spurs.  While The Dallas ABA basketball team eventually became the San Antonio Spurs, they were known as The Dallas Chaparrals before the move south..furthermore they did not exist before 1967.  I'll give him some literary leeway for the bet on a fight that never took place (Dick Tiger's loss to Tom Case)..Just find these things distracting and wish that he had done a little more research.  Being overly picky?  Yeah, I probably am.  But when an author fails to research smaller details such as this..ya gotta wonder how extensive his research was on things more relevant to the story.  My only other problem with this book is that he took between 800 and 900 pages to tell a story that could have been told in 500 to 600 pages without compromising the plot and without so much unnecessary filler.  A pretty good read even so.  Might be a fairly decent movie if handles right.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Great device for the money. Awesome Youtube playback device, thought make sure your Wifi Signal is strong for good sound and picture quality. For $35 bucks you can't really complain.
B005V5WBFG|5|AWESOME!!!
B006VRDZ44|5|Love it! Saving my money for season 2 etc,
B0083Z614S|4|It's a solid children's story. Mostly positive, though presents a very privileged POV. It also makes the Sowerby family and other working families seem idealized and a little too happy to be poor. Overall, a good story that doesn't involve violence or treachery, etc.
B00GINENG0|5|My sister loves it since she can't have a real cat, this is the next best thing. Love it !

B00H58VGIA|5|Best book I have read in a long time.  The point of view between the two main characters was interesting and understandable.
B004H1V5RU|5|I bought this for my 13 year old son for Christmas.  This is his first Perplexus.  Great for a rainy day.  It's durable and keeps you focused.  Good exercise for your mind.  One thing I will warn is (like a lot of other toys), this gets played with at first, and then finds it's way into the lonely section of the toy box.  I would not recommend this for kids under 6 as it will probably encourage tantrums!  It can be frustrating at times, especially when the marble falls off the track.  Over all, a good buy.
B00000AOUD|5|For Jethro Tull's &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; album, Ian Anderson writes the lyrics, composes the music, sings the songs, does the arrangements, and then finds time to play the flute, acoustic guitar, violin, saxophone, trumpet and whatever else is lying around.  On top of that, he creates Gerald &quot;Little Milton&quot; Bostock, the eight-year-old prodigy whose scandalous poem &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; was deemed unfit to receive first prize from The Society For Literary Achievement And Gestation (SLAG), and Julian Stone-Mason B.A., who reviews the Jethro Tull album &quot;Thick as a Brick.&quot;  All of this is chronicled in the four pages of the St. Cleve's Chronicle, all of which is faithfully reproduced for the little booklet that comes with this CD.  The review by &quot;Stone-Mason&quot; concludes: &quot;One doubts at times the validity of what appears to be an expanding theme throughout the two continuous sides of this record but the result is at worst entertaining and at least aesthetically palatable.&quot;  Who am I to argue?  I enjoy the satirical articles in Anderson's faux newspaper (e.g., &quot;Non-Rabbit Missing&quot;) almost as much as I enjoy the music on the album.<br />Thematically &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; is similar to &quot;Aqualung.&quot;  Again the writing is dense and enigmatic, but of course this is part of the fun.  Anderson bemoans the social decay but he sees salvation down the road, but ultimately the lyrics take a back suit to the music and the brilliant arrogance of creating sections on the &quot;single track&quot; that are unique and yet clearly part of the whole.  The thematic unity of the songs on &quot;Aqualung&quot; is now more than matched by a musical integration of various styles into a complete whole.  You can recognize aspects of English folk music and classical bits in the mode of Handel, along with various types of jazz.  One of the nice results of this grand design is that for the first time Anderson's singing seems well suited to the music.  By this point in the group's history Anderson had surrounded himself with the musicians who would finally allow him to explore his unique artistic vision.  In the end just remember: &quot;your wise men don't know how it feels/to be thick as a brick.&quot;  This is Jethro Tull's best album from start to finish, although certainly they come close to reclaiming the magic in &quot;Passion Play.&quot;s well suited to the music.

B00E8KLWB4|5|I am really enjoying the game. The objects are easy to see. The graphics are good. There is a lot to do to keep busy. The best part is that it really is a free game. Been looking for a while to find a hidden objects game that was truly free and now I have and I am hooked!
B0000025QC|5|This and a later CD entitled 'White Winds' are Vollenweider's best works! They take you on a magic journey to distant places that you never want to return from . . . so you play the CD's again and again . . . I challenge  anyone with an open mind to experience one or both of these.
B00HDMMISA|5|Great book
B008Y2FRFO|5|nothing too hard. reminds me of a game I used to play as a kid.. very fun and non stressful game. try it! its free why not
B008C20TDG|5|I love, love, love this book! When I decided to do the Whole 30 I have to admit that I was a little intimidated. It was easy at first but I knew the time would come when I would have to fight off some pretty intense cravings. That's where this book comes in. Understanding how certain foods affect our bodies has been key for me in my Whole 30 success. Knowing how these foods affect our hormones, emotions, chemical reactions and basically every other thing that goes on in our complex systems has made me not even want to consume any of the foods on the &#34;DO NOT EAT&#34; list. When I even think about having a craving (usually just a little something sweet) I just imagine what's going to happen once it's inside my body and it's not even worth it. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone that's considering embarking on this Whole 30 journey. I don't recommend trying it without it!
B007BVMVDU|5|Truly enjoyed the series...can't wait to see the next season. My favorite character is Tyrion Lanister who seems to possess a lot more honor than the whole of his family.
B00J2PRBNS|5|Awesome movie, shows times have not changed much in government. Money and bribes will buy you everything and to heck with morals.
B006RXQ8RI|5|I love Q's movies and this one does not disappoint. Great movie! I can't imagine how much training this movie required from everyone involved. i watched it 10 years ago and still looks great! Thanks!
0525950079|1|I came as far as 400 pages and then I stopped reading the book. It was just to similar to POTE. What was most annoying though were the frequent sexual references in the book. It appears that Follett's imagination of the middle ages is that everybody was horny and just continuously looking for sexual gratification. The other annoying item was the authors obvious dislike of the Christian religion. Pretty much every stereotype was checked off: Gay priests/monks, lesbian nuns, womanizing bishops, ignorant church people. You even get a feminist 'hero' who performs an abortion on herself. The book was gripping for a while but after some time the storyline became boring. Building a cathedral is just so much more interesting than building a bridge. Anyway, I regret having bought the book.
B00GYVPHMA|5|I really enjoy music
B000P0J0EW|5|Story telling just does not get any better. Steven King's short story was terrific and yet Frank Duramont (director), Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, Mark Ralston put capture on film the telling of a tale you will want to hear again and again.<br /><br />It just do not get any better than this.
B00BSBR9N6|4|Simsion manages to blend some romance, comedy, and life together effortlessly. I found myself laughing out loud during some parts...and feeling the main characters pain and loneliness in others. Great book, found it difficult to put down.
B00L436E7A|1|Game sucks
0785139168|3|This graphic format may encourage young readers to read the original text. There is nothing wrong with a faithful adaptation. In fact, the covers of the five issues are quite original and enticing for female readers because they make each issue look like the front cover of a magazine for girls. The authors cleverly want to place the old classic into a modern context; they want to make a connection between today's youth with the issues faced by young women back then. \\"How to Cure Boy-Crazy Sisters!\\" or \\"17 Secrets About Summer Dresses,\\" and \\"Army Boys: 34 Reasons We Love Them.\\" You can tell that the editors gave it a lot of thought to these titles. The first one refers to the crazy Bennet sisters, Lydia and Kitty; the second title refers to the importance of choosing a proper dress for a ball; and then third title refers to the fact that Lydia and Kitty went crazy about soldiers, specifically, the \\"wicked\\" Wickham.<br /><br />The weakness of the text lies on the illustrations. Personally, I couldn't tell the difference between the Bennet sisters. Secondly, the illustrations didn't seem strong enough to invite younger readers. The only hit here was Mr. Collins, who resembles the freckled face on the old Mad magazines. Also, the writers and illustrators didn't translate into graphic format Darcy's long letter explaining his behavior to Elizabeth. Readers will just see the image of Elizabeth holding the letter while there is a lot of text placed on each panel. Also, the same front covers that may entice female readers may be harmful because it would suggest that P&P is only for women. Would boys or male adolescents be attracted to this text using these covers?<br /><br />These are the reasons why I give this text 3 stars.
