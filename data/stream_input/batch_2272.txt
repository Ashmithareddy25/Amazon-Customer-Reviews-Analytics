B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This is one of the best animated movies I've seen in a long time. Our whole family loves it! I don't think they advertised it very well...it seems like few people have heard of it, at least where I live. That's a shame, because it was a great movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a wonderful tale written from a dogs point of view.. Very well written.. A great read..get your tissue ready!!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Very moving. Gets you really thinking. Very influential. I would recommend to anyone. Especially if you are struggling with finding meaning in your life.
B000002J1Y|4.0|It's my personal belief that every audiophile should have at least a few live albums in his collection; &#34;Yessongs&#34; is one of mine, and a personal favorite in its original vinyl form.  Some tracks, like &#34;Siberian Khatru&#34; and &#34;Perpetual Change,&#34; sound better than their studio counterparts, and Chris Squire's jaw-dropping bass solo during &#34;The Fish&#34; is by itself worth the price of the album.<br />However, this CD set was remastered rather poorly; much of the ambient noise that analog recording catches--and which is itself a part of the music--has been eliminated, resulting in a thinner, more sterile sound (I went back and listened to my vinyl version, and I can hear the difference clearly).  Moreover, the tracks are divided strangely; &#34;Siberian Khatru,&#34; for example, ends with Jon Anderson introducing the next song, &#34;Heart of the Sunrise.&#34;  For someone like myself, who constantly creates playlists and mixes for &#34;on the go&#34; listening, it's very frustrating.<br />They did include all of Roger Dean's wonderful cover art (the original package was a W-fold, and each fold contained a different painting), but that kind of album art has to be large to be appreciated fully, so the best I can give on that is half-a-point for trying.<br />So all in all, it's rather a toss-up.  Technically, the CD isn't very good...but the greatness of the music therein more than makes up for its engineering faults.

B0080M3OGW|3.0|Anything with DeNiro and/or Streep is worth seeing.  This film, however, was a little disappointing in that I was never sure of the reason for DeNiro's actions in the film whereas Streep's seemed justifiied.  I can't say more without giving away the plot.  Overall, though it was interesting, well-acted, and had nice scenes of New York City which I enjoyed.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Upfront: it's missing the sweet, innocent, magical and heartwarming charm of &#34;The Fellowship.&#34; I saw all those familiar places and familiar faces: Gandalf, Bag End, The Shire, Elrond, Rivendell. I missed Strider and the original hobbits. I missed the danger they were running from, the reason for their journey. The tone of this film is different, which is perfectly fine, I just wasn't really expecting that difference. It was harder to reconcile in this film. In the 2nd and 3rd films, when we get away from all the old and familiar and into the new and different they were much easier to get into and enjoy on their own.<br /><br />Everyone complains that it's long, but I don't have a problem with length if it fleshes out the story. OTOH, contriving shots to stuff into already over-extended battle/fight scenes definitely adds to the weight and sluggish speed of the film with adding anything crucial to the story. They were glaringly obvious, jarring and they took me out of the story every time, which is why this is 3 stars instead of 4 OTOH, I think every second of exposition and character development was necessary. There were so many dwarves and so much background information and I think both were delivered pretty well.the action of the first 3rd of the story is here, but enhanced and turned up a few notches. Characters are more defined, the dangers are greater, the battles and escapes are more perilous and the &#34;Pale Orc/Azog,&#34; though not actually IN the original story, is brought in here to make Thorin's hatred and thirst for revenge more visible to the the viewer. In fact, when faced with Azog, Thorin becomes so enraged that he loses his focus and judgment.<br /><br />Many of the scenes, both action and exposition, give deliberate hints of Sauron's rapidly increasing presence outside of Mordor, setting the stage for the events of the The Trilogy in the future. With the exception of Galadriel the elves seem oddly and uncharacteristically unaware of these tell-tale signs of Sauron's imminent return. The events don't happen for another 60 years, but 60 years to an elf would be like 6 minutes to a mortal; it's a fairly brief period of time for them. They should already be suspicious of what's going on in Mordor, paricularly now that something &#34;evil&#34; has suddenly cropped up well outside of it. Gandalf certainly is suspicious. Also, Saruman makes a brief cameo appearance, teasing the audience into wondering how far he has gone at this point &#34;over to the dark side.&#34; Is he already sneaking peeks at the palantir? What does he know already about Sauron that no one else suspects? Is he trying to discourage Gandalf's quest with the dwarfs for genuinely benevolent reasons or for more underhanded ones? We don't really know for sure, and at this point, I rather like the mystery. I hope at the end of the 3rd film we're given some insight on the Saruman of the future. (Christopher Lee has already stated that to him, Saruman is still a good and benevolent soul, but again, there's the matter that there are only 60 years between the events in The Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy. Sauron is well on his way &#34;back;&#34; I would expect Saruman to be well aware of this by this stage; perhaps because he's already started looking into that cursed palantir.)<br /><br />The &#34;Riddles in the Dark&#34; is the pivotal scene. Andy Serkis has added dimensions to Gollum that are beyond even what Tolkien meant for him. He has the remarkable ability to make the character both sweet and innocent one moment, malicious and dangerous the next. He's both comical and malevolent. The scene lasts barely 15 minutes but it's the most compelling 15 minutes in the film. And we get to SEE the moment that Bilbo takes pity on Gollum and decides not to hurt him, linking that moment to the scene 60 years later when Frodo complains to Gandalf that it was a pity that Bilbo didn't kill Gollum when he had the chance. Gandalf reminds Frodo that it was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. And without Gollum, the ring would have never been destroyed. Earlier in the film, Gandalf tells Bilbo that &#34;true courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when to spare one.&#34; And that's when Bilbo decides to exhibit that courage.<br /><br />As much as I liked Radagast, as cute and funny as his scenes are, I found the scene in which he's trying to save the injured hedgehog a little too long. I'm not sure we needed him to be the one who explored Dol Guldur; Gandalf goes his own way apart from the company several times. There is no reason he couldn't have been the one to stumble upon the... &#34;foul creatures&#34; at some point and then explored the old fortress himself. But Radagast's rabbit sled and the diversion he creates as he draws the orcs and wargs away from the dwarf company was an inspired idea. AND I lovelovelove Sylvester McCoy!
B0036BK6MW|4.0|I don't see that she deserved an Oscar for her role.  She was good but not extraordinary.  The film as a whole was very enjoyable and the story was wonderful - especially since it is based on real people and events.
1603580557|5.0|I  find this book very readable The way in which Meadows explains how systems thinking works is quite easy to understand.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Classic game that is always fun!  Great for waiting in line or for an appointment.  Exercise your brain as much as possible!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I looked through some of the 1-star reviews out of curiosity. I believe some have valid points regarding taste, but not the quality. Several complained about \\"nothing happening\\", but I would call that a very encompassing view of \\"nothing\\". If you are looking for the equivalent of Hollywood blockbuster, then you would probably be better served by a different book. That's not to say that there aren't elements of actions, suspense, etc., but they remain quite personal--even when they involve multiple people, or the whole silo. I think it's a bit like the difference between an introvert and an extrovert. This book is a hard-core introvert and is quite comfortable in its own space; just don't expect it to go out dancing with you.
076780421X|4.0|An old movie but still a very romatic one. Probably a chick flick but as a man i can watch it time and again.

B0012GMUSQ|1.0|Are you anxious to find out what Alice In Chains has been up to? Trying to catch up on the last CDs releases? Save your money on this one. To me, it was worth $2 new. 5 songs. I give song two $1. and song five 1 cent. Was song five some kind of joke. I'm not laughing. I spent $7 for CRAP. not SAP. Song five was like musical diarrhea - like they were obligated to have five songs to produce this thing. I don't want to be the guy that looks back and longs for tunes like AGAIN and THEM BONES - but I am. I long for the hard hitting ROCK songs for many bands that continue to pump out slow \\"sappy\\" songs. I hope the CD release in May has has some hard hitting songs and NOT slow S***.

0240810961|5.0|Written by the late Disney animator Walt Stanchfield, this book is a wealth of knowledge about the principles and practices of the animation process. I bought this book for a class on 2D animation, and I found it very helpful in learning the principles of animation as well as the thought processes that are required in order to create drawings and animations that tell a story that appeals to an audience. Since this book is a collection of the lectures given by Stanchfield in his classes, it contains a great deal of information, all of which is extremely helpful in learning about the animation process. The principles discussed in the book are often demonstrated with drawings of familiar Disney characters, which makes the book more entertaining and easier to understand. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to make successful animations that tell a story that audiences will enjoy.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|This edition included three disks. 1, Babel album, 2.  Audio from Rd Rocks live. 3. DVD Red Rocks live.<br />All three had great sound quality and the DVD had great shots of the performance. Plus Munford &Sons performances in the studio and at Red Rock were outstanding.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'll start by saying, I have never felt the need to write a review until I read this book. I read the first book (Wool 1), that is available for free, and then tried a sample from Wool 2. Wool 1 intrigued me into starting the next book, and the sample sucked me in and I just had to keep reading. For $3.99, this book is a steal. Mr. Howey gives such life to the characters and their environment, at times you feel you are there.<br />I don't want to make this an overly long, boring review, so I will end by saying; do yourself a favor and read this amazing book that will surely become a classic.
B00985E3UG|5.0|The book made me feel very angry, cheated and duped out of a healthier life.....and all for money. Shame on our food corporations! I now eat only food that I prepare. I spend my time in the produce isles of farmer's markets whenever it is possible. I am considering a vegetarian diet, or that of meat that I have raised, hunted, or fished for. This book is excellent for making us all aware of what depth big business reaches to make tons of money! I have boycotted processed food and I have now lost almost 10 pounds. I do have to work longer in the kitchen, but I make extra to freeze...creating my own quick meals.<br />What these corporations are doing to our children sicken me!<br />So....great work Michael Moss!!
0765325950|4.0|Not the best ending to an epic series like this, but hey, at least it's over! If you made it this far, you know you have to follow through and end it.
B0030F5W5K|5.0|The special effects are kinda hokey but the movie is great.  We remember the movie when it first came out.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|For the price you really can't complain about anything. But I will mention, I bought this for a 7D dslr, and with a 15mm fisheye on it, the handle did bend a little from the weight. Not to big of a deal, but it did make jiggle more of an issue. Just something I noted, still works great though!
B000FCKC4C|3.0|Interesting & has inspiring thoughts but a bit redundant at times. although the book relays a positive reminder for life

B004PHE9F6|5.0|Director John Frankenheimer's most ambitious film captures what Formula I racing was in the mid-1960s.  Evident from the reviews here at Amazon it is a treasured film.  When this film premiered at the Hollywood Cinerama Dome, it was a sensation starting with its Oscar winning titles and cinematography.  It was shot entirely on location - filmed in luscious 70mm and presented with multi-track audio.  The composite imagery scattered throughout the movie gives it an art film feel - an art film that is thrilling.  It is still thrilling, dramatic and (frankly) melodramatic.  Frankenheimer's intent was to make a quality racing film that had broad appeal for general audiences and it worked.  (Much later, Frankenheimer would utilize what he learned making Grand Prix and apply it his excellent noir-thriller, Ronin.)  Grand Prix is a racing film made by a superb filmmaker.  Note: As popular as Grand Prix was (and remains), just 4-years later it was topped by actor Steve McQueen's equally ambitious Le Mans.  Spend some time working with professional racing drivers and crews as I have and you learn that most of them consider Grand Prix to be a &#34;soap opera with wheels.&#34;  Steve McQueen's other career was racing.  For his film, McQueen chose to feature the &#34;race of races&#34; - the annual 24-hour 220+ mph endurance spectacle held in Le Mans, France.  As a result, Le Mans (1970) is the film that professional drivers value for its fairly accurate portrayal of GT Motorsport.  Le Mans is a racing film made by a seasoned racer.

B009KEN87O|4.0|Addicted that the game.. Im not a fan of invincible mode.. Just seems harder to hit target should just let yiu shoot as normal but not get killed
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|Fans of Cronenberg will love this film, as he delivers a vivid portrayal of DeLillo's novel with his usual intensity. I loved both the edginess and the surreal quality. The film is dark but has frequent glimpses of dry humor.<br /><br />The performances are outstanding, from Pattinson through all of the supporting actors to Giamatti. In particular, both Pattinson and Giamatti were riveting in their 20 minute final scene.<br /><br />It's not the action-packed film the trailer seems to imply, so if that is what you're looking for, look elsewhere. Yes, there's violence, sometimes shocking, but overall the focus is on dialogue, since the film takes place almost entirely within billionaire Packer's limo.

An excellent follow up to The View From The Hill.<br />Mostly new material with a couple of bluegrass fused versions of old songs and \\"dance\\" versions of \\"out There Somewhere\\"<br />I enjoyed them all. Justin's smooth voice, new melodies and new takes of older material all work. I'd love Justin to tour Australia with his solo work. All in all I cannot stop listening to this classy CD.

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|A really fun action packed adventure film with amazing acting and a great story.<br />Don't mind the bad reviews. People went in expecting another Lord of the Rings and were disappointed when it wasn't as amazing as the LOTR were. But the thing is, The Hobbit is a much more lighthearted adventure tale geared toward children. It's supposed to feel a little different from LOTR.<br /><br />There is so much to love about this movie. The acting is amazing, as is the score and the action scenes(for the most part) are really well done. And it's very funny. There are a few things I didn't really like. I think there is a bit to much goofy humor in some scenes.<br /><br />But all in all a really satisfying adventure flick.
B000S1M9LY|1.0|Sorry, I tried to read this book when it first came out. Got about 50 pages in and was so bored that I quit. After years of people telling me that I was missing something, I tried again. Same result. I just think this book is boring. Maybe it's just me.

B000059MEK|5.0|This album is one of, if not the, most popular albums of Daft Punk.You don't have to be an electronic music fan to love 'Discovery' (I wasn't, but I became a convert recently).It's easy on the ears (all-time track 'One More Time'), explosive (Aerodynamic's arpeggios will make your brain come;best track on the album), and it can be soothing ('Something About Us').The downsides of this album: hard to point out.'Disocvery' is on'e of those albums you can't hate or criticize.It's not 'Nevermind' but it's still good and worth a buy.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett's second novel in his Century Trilogy - Winter World - picks up where the first left off following World War I as Europe poses to plunge headlong into World War II. Follett is a master at describing the agony and ugliness of war. To follow the Second World War through Germany with Follett is like living the experience ... he tells a remarkable story!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Sometimes you read something and you are pleasantly surprised... and sometimes you read something and you think I have just read the next Hugo Award Winner...  Well this book, by Andy Weir, is just that; a surprising well written comical Sci-Fi satire.  Some have compared it to a Sci-Fi \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" but in my opinion Robinson Crusoe although well written and pretty much a compulsory English 101 read. Is BORING.  \\"The Martian,\\" is a witty, raw, high tech thriller.  I was worried that the book was so good at the beginning that it would lose steam and become a disappointment---yet it turned into a fun page turner for me all the way through...  AWESOME JOB Andy... Keep it coming.  I am still laughing at some of the vernacular used...particularly liked the ending.... The communiqué between NASA and Mars pleasantly reminded me of Paul Torday's \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.\\"  I whole heartedly recommend this book to other Sci-Fi readers.

B006JD48NM|5.0|We closely followed F1 during this time period, both on TV and attending races. This film captures the essence of this period of F1 racing: interaction of drivers, safety issues, politics, all in the context of the career of one of, if not the greatest, F1 driver.

B00942X8PY|3.0|The first several levels are just a learning process in which new options are presented and it is up to the player to figure out how to use them.  It would have been nice if there was a simple screen shot warning or introducing the new option being presented.  Overall I like the game I just keep having to figure out how to use the new option.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My 4 yr old LOVES this movie!  And so does my husband!  lol  It is certainly not a typical storyline - and thats part of what we like about it.  Heartwarming, funny tale of bad guy goes good.

B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I purchased this movie without having watched it in the theater, and knew very little about the moving going into it, other than the fact that the movie took place in the &#34;Alien&#34; franchise universe, and acted as a prequel of sorts.  The movie was AWESOME to watch in 3D, and had a fun story (with a few caveats).  I will not post anything in regards to the story, as I don't want to spoil it, but if you get the chance to watch the film you should definitely watch it in 3D, as the film was actually shot in 3D.  The special features were VERY well done, and I STRONGLY recommend watching them if you are a little confused after the story ends (just as I was), as it does explain a few things that are talked about in the movie.  I guess the last thing I'll say about the movie is that it does not answer all of the questions you have, which I actually think is a good thing, as Alien (1979) did not answer all of the questions either.

B005LAIH4A|4.0|My rating comes more from my kids (ages 5, 4 and 4), and they loved this movie.  It's colorful, has some humor, some catchy tunes, and it's actually a pretty decent family movie.  I would recommend it as a movie for family night.
B007M45PMU|5.0|One of the best albums I've purchased in a long time. You will not be disappointed! I can listen to the whole thing start to finish over and over :)
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Just watched this movie.  Filming concept is different.  It's theme is a theatre concept which is confusing to say the least.  Editing could have been better.  Costumes were fabulous.  Acting was okay, but couldn't get away from Anna's crooked teeth which were quite distracting.  But this is my opinion.  So with this warning, if you still want to watch it then go for it.  I myself was bored.

About 3 hours later there were hundreds of darts all over the yard and I was tired of reloading it.  The fires at a pretty fast rate but it makes a rather loud mechanical and pop noise which he would do even when it was empty inside and that quickly became annoying.  Perhaps 5 was a bit young for this specific toy.  I had fun playing with it for awhile and I'm 33 so I'm sure teens would probably enjoy it too.  The only problem of seemed to have other than the noise was that it jammed from the to time or the clips jammed so it wouldn't always get through the whole thing without some manual intervention.  It really is impressive though in both looks and proformance.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Was told this movie got a lot of accedmy awards so I rented it. It was not worth the rental fee. I should have waited for Redbox to offer this movie for a rental.
0765325950|5.0|RJ and BS did a great job in tying all the story lines together, creating an entertaining and satisfying end to this grand series! Very, very well done!!
1419705849|5.0|A great addition to a very great series. Buy it if you like to read mindless stories about a boy that has comedic events happen in his middle school life. I've been reading the series since 6th grade actually. I love every book. Worth $10
B003O86FMW|4.0|Wow this book is so amazing of how the Victors from the hunger game. Later return and have completed the quarter quill and to have a winner of a distract. So fab and its like an adventure to be in. OMG! This is all I gonna review about this
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Great story and an easy read. Wonderfully written. I'm going to see the movie now that I've finished the book.!!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It is an intense and amazingly surprising and really good tread it do it do it do it do it do it¡!!!!!!!!!!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Album is amazing. Surprised to some people saying this is overhyped and boring.<br /><br />This album offers a complete musical 'experience' from top to bottom.<br /><br />Pusher love girl, Suit & Tie, That girl offer a real old school blues/jazz feel to it.<br /><br />Strawberry Bubblegum and Mirrors offer great chilled vocals.<br /><br />Then Let the Groove in offers than uptempo song you just want to dance to.<br /><br />For me though the standout track is Tunnel Vision. The production on that track is flawless.<br /><br />Timbaland + JT are an amazing team and it is shown throughout this album<br /><br />5/5
B008G12ERC|4.0|Not their best album, but still a delightfully good one with some unique songs. This band is just awesome, and you have got to appreciate their eclectic styles of music.<br /><br />I find myself listening to tracks 1 through 5... and then skipping to the dramatic 12-13 instrumentals. Songs in between are different, not my taste. But still, an album you'll love to jam to. Great work, Muse!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i feel that all the temple run games are very much alike.  but yet it is still fun to play. gathering point and sliding jumping and trying not to get eaten. Amazon has good game for kindle i-pad what ever.
B002ZG997C|4.0|Loved it.  I dont buy many movies because I am so darn picky.. this one was worth it, to add to my collection.
B0058VW36U|4.0|now this is a really challenging game and i like it a lot. as soon as i figure out what i'm suppose to do.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This is an awesome book with lots of suspense and adventure.  This book has an amazing story with a wonderful ending.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the book because it clean filth, not overbearing with fowl language. make me wish i had a Mr Grey. when i finish the book i will get the other two books.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|It drags to much.  Doesn't hold my interest like some other books he has written.  Sorry would not recommend it .
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i haven't got to the next level yet but i'm working on it. i like the challenge and the diffident boards
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Does exactly what I need it to do. Can set multiple alarms...great for getting me up and going before the next alarm reminds me to get the kids up.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|love this game, the colors, the action, everything. once i start it seems i cant put it down, its on
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I actually watch Season 3 for the first time this year.  Loved it and then ordered all three seasons to catch up.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Read Wool Omnibus as well as First Shift, Second Shift and Third Shift by Hugh Howley.  So much better. Not a bad book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love the history, the clothes & the drama.  Looking forward to Season 4.  Wish they wouldn't jump so much in time.
1616550414|5.0|I love the zelda series and this book is something every zelda fan should get! This book has so many things that explain all of the mysteries if zelda. Dont think about just get it!!!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|My favorite Bond film so far.  I thought there was more substance than action in this one.  I can't wait for the next one.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I had seen this movie before  but my husband had not. We watched it as soon as we could, and he laughed out loud. We really like having this movie in our collection.
B0084670FU|5.0|The story line is to the different events that was taking place made this a good movie to watch. One scene is how that gun that was giving as a gift had rippling affect to the point where someone lost their life.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I try and play a lot of apps but only like a few enough to keep with that said its in my favorits. I would have bought it before it was free but it only showed up after the price drop. graphics are solid power ups are fun instant classic. but I have two complaints one not enough levels and not enough time in the day!
B0018CWEYY|4.0|I can see this story starting to get a little confusing, like the writers are starting to lose themselves.  Wish that is would not jump all over the place.
B006G2124E|5.0|It's a moving story, that is (with the exception of ONE short subplot) suitable for children, but can entertain and educate adults as well. It confronts a problem in our history which has largely been ignored, and in some ways, continues today..,.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|was disappointed with the end of this series.  I should have stopped at the end of the 5th.  Poor wrap up of the show.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|We rented this movie and the entire family loved it!  So we bought it.  Yes, it's an odd concept, but so well done that we actually wished it were true!
B0019LY5IM|4.0|Thought this series was good but not as good as the first 3 series.  But kept me wanting to buy the last series to see how it all wrapped up.  Dud ending
B000002GLV|5.0|No need to make this complex.  I bought this LP  when it was released in 1971.  It was always one of my favorites, so when it became available on CD it bought it.  A couple of years ago a family member borrowed it and never returned it, so I bought it again.  I have now purchased this three times which shows you how much  I like it.  I am a big fan of trumpeter Blue Mitchell, but everyone is terrific.  I can listen to this over and over and over and....
0896898288|5.0|The book and blocks are wonderful!! I HATE the cd.  There was not much thought but into the cd format for the block templates.  Each template has its own file.  To print off a block you may have to open and print 5 plus files. This is very time consuming and a big waste of paper.  Some templates may be only a one inch block.  I also have The Farmers Wife Pony Club book.  The cd that came with that book has each block template on the same page and is on several files so you can scroll to the block you want and choose to print that page of the file.  That is how this cd should have been.  If they would change the cd to do like the other book it would be wonderful!!  As it is, it took half a day to open 100 plus files to print each template individually and it took over 100 pages of paper.  With The Farmers Wife Pony Club cd it took me maybe 20 minutes to print out the blocks I wanted and they were all on the same page.  For this book I now have to go through the 100 plus pages and sort out which template will go with which block.  That will take the rest of the day.  Poor choice publishers on the cd!!  Redo the cd and you will have a wonderful tool to use with the book.  As the cd is now it is a big waste of time and paper!!!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book. I was not expecting what happened in the end which made it even better. I highly recommend this book.
B00ABNCMKW|5.0|This is the best album of 2013 so far in my opinion. I admit that I hadn't heard of Biffy Clyro (live in the US) until this came out recently, but I've since given this album a bunch of listens along with Only Revolutions and a few older ones. This band is blowing my mind. GET THIS ALBUM! So many great tunes on Opposites like Victory Over the Sun, Opposites, Black Chandelier, Spanish Radio, Biblical, etc etc, they're all great. Get it and enjoy!
B008BO61BE|5.0|I thought. Rob is the King of the Scream!! It just doesnt get any better than this. His voice defines the whole CD. No one and I mean no one can Scream better than him. But lets not forget the rest of the Band. They all sound great on this. Really I think the best are Dave and Ian. I much prefer this line up over the others. Maybe its because this is still my favorite Album they did!! Really all I can is if your a JP fan and dont have this. What are you waiting for!!!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I love his music!  He is a great artist and just my style of music.  Keep making good music.  Yeah
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved this book. There were questions in my mind as I jumped from page to page. I had to keep reading to find the answers, and not until the very end did I figure it out! Then I wanted to start all over, now that I knew more. I was still intrigued.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I love this book. However, this edition has some odd typos in it: there are French accent marks over English words. Otherwise, it's perfect.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The updates on this app have caused me to make it my &quot;go to&quot; for weather! It will definitely find a place in my favorites list.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|the final book of this series was a little bit disappointing, it seemed to just end.  It seemed the first book was so exciting but the series went downhill from there.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Great movie.... wonderful story. Very emotional and very well done. It started off slow bit once it picked up I was hooked.  Must watch
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is one of those old school games with some new school flavor. Very simple and user friendly.  It's a time killer.  In fact I should be doing homework now.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|I received this item in prestine condition and on time! This is my grandsons favorite Toy Story movie so we have to watch it over and over and over again. Thank you! :)
0143121006|4.0|Had heard a book-review on radio and subsequently ordered this book.  It fulfilled my expectations and made for pleasant reading.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I relived so much of the 80's through this futuristic tale.  Who knew that the 80's held such promise?  I loved loved loved this book
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This app is really good but sometimes it can get messed up and you will lose the game and it os really hard to get more players/character. So that is what I think about the app. Love, Me
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is less of a self help book than a own your own life book.  I don't know what more there is to learn than these four things.  After this the rest is just story
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book. It kept my attention and kept me wanting more. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|In the evolution of this tale this was a book I did not want to end.  I have already ordered more of Orson Scott Card'a books
B001NHNG64|4.0|Holds you through the entire book. Must read in order so you follow the travels of Jck Reacher. As you read this you can imagine the plot and story could actually happen.
B003VS0CWY|5.0|Hey its a classic my kid loved it now my grandkids love it too. They dont make them like this anymore. Guaranteed to make you laugh , sing and cry
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After downloading the free sample (which I was pleasantly surprised to find includes the complete first installment which was originally a stand alone short story, as well as the first few chapters of Wool 2) I found myself so intrigued I had to read more. Wool chronicles the lives of people living within the dystopic society of The Silo. What starts as a very personal story of one man and his wife slowly unfolds to include a variety of characters, all who have one thing in common: they're figuring out the dark secrets of the Silo. I found this book to not only be very well written but the pacing was excellent as well, propelling me forward.  The chapters often ended in cliffhangers or big reveals that made me go &#34;That sneaky little...&#34; or &#34;No way!&#34; Of course, nothing made me want to read more than a big surprise to shake things up.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I am really enjoying this  cd.  I would recommend to jazz fans, I thought for an Englishman to do jazz was pretty neat.
0307352153|5.0|I finally feel vindicated.!!  When I began telling my oldest son about the book, he said &#34;Mom, I am reading it right now and love it.&#34; How's that for serendipity?
B000002GW5|5.0|Can't go wrong with a Jackson Browne CD  Old music never goes away, it just gets better with time.  Sweet
B00B49L7JY|5.0|really really good, I hope to see him in person, interesting tale, never answered what happened to the money sent to the record company
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awsome, my husband is so obsessed with it.  Watched the whole season one and two in two weeks. Now season three.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Not sure what to expect since I'm not a big fan of rap/hip-hop, but this album just blew my mind. It is amazing. Each song is different... it has its own flavor, beautifully made and composed. Not sure if you should purchase it just listen to some songs on YouTube.<br /><br />And I have to love the fact that he's from Seattle. Gotta rep the Pacific Northwest. #goseattle
B005LAII94|4.0|I like the plot. I thought this wasn't going to be a good movie, but I was surprised. It's a violent movie that's for sure.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The story of a great American hero. His whole story was interesting and the way he served our country during and after the war.
B004XQO90O|3.0|I wish had more action in it. This movie wasn't what I expected. It is one of those movies I don't think I will watch it again.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Always love Twilight, but this extended edition is a must have.  Love the extras.  A true companion for any twilighter.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I saw season one and got hooked.  I had to see what happened.  Season two final show was a nail bitter.  Had a scene I did not see coming.  Hope they do a next season.
B0013ND36G|5.0|Its a good logical wrap up for the Arnie Terminator series. Seriously. The ending makes perfect senseandtye action is great. Arnie could have used some better wittier one liners though.but his performance was great. Clqire danes was just a useless female lead.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This &#34;Love Story&#34; is so different from everything I've read before, no cliches. I loved it. Not all happy endings are as we expect it. :)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|enjoyed this game very much.liked the puzzles. they were a challenge without being frustrating like some games. I enjoy the logic needed to figure out how the scenes work together. this isxa fair amount of play on the free app too.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I started reading this simply because Chris wrote it, and I am so glad I did. It exceeded every expectation and I will be eagerly awaiting the next installment.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is an amazingly fun shooter with an old school feel but a modern twist.<br /><br />Looking at the screenshots does not do this game justice. You just have to play it to realize how awsome it is.<br /><br />One of the best FAOTD ever.
0451418441|2.0|I can't really tell what's wrong with this book without giving mild spoiler away, so skip this review if you want to be surprised.<br />This is basically Pillars of the Earth all over again. Skip two centuries and you have exactly the same archetypes:<br />- Jack Builder -> Merthin;<br />- William -> Ralph<br />- Lady Aliena -> Caris<br />- Bishop Waleran -> Prior Godwyn<br /><br />In one book they build a Cathedral in the other a bridge. Both needs stones, people die at the same quarry. The Earl of Shiring is still a bastard, the bishop/prior is still corrupt to the bone, the romantic couple go through all sorts of drama (couldn't they just get married already). And the sex .... I like sex as much as the next guy but did he really have to make Gwenda enjoy getting rapped ... twice? It's just gratuitous and serves no plot point.<br /><br />Halfway through the book I gave up. It's way too long, it should have been edited as there isn't content worthy of 1000 pages. Very disappointing.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|very fast, has practically every translation available ever written, only reson for 4 stars is that I wish it would work off line better
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|My wife downloaded this for her Kindle Fire and absolutely LOVES it. Very user friendly, LOTS of options, it will even read your notes back to you!! She has just beun to use it and keeps finding  tons and tons of great little settings to tweak and use. There are many different applications for this, and it's FREE.<br />Can't say enough good thinkgs about it. Very well done app.<br />Did I mention that it's also free?
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I have seen promos for this movie and I don't think they did itjustice, this was so much better than expected.  I though it would be a dumb comedy, but it really was great.  Bravo.  If you like vampire movies, this is a no brainer.  So much better than I thought it would be.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|Not one of Lee's Best, enjoy all of these tales some excel whereas this one drones on a bit. Next?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This program is one of the best that I have seen.  The actors portraying the characters are wonderful.  I<br />Love the story line.  I am completely hooked on it!! Looking forward to the next season.
B003Y5H5F6|1.0|i bought this the day that it came out because i like the first 2 real ones a lot.  i was sad about the Lycans one because it was just a franchise piece but i think that might have been better than this even with Kate's return.  this movie was more of a franchise piece than Lycans!  $$$ ching ching ching $$$  yeah, yeah, action action, big deal.  Kate's back!  ...why?  i'm only guessing that she either didn't have a lot else to do and could use some more money for her mortgage OR!  she was imprisoned by some contract.  I'm not saying that she's the best actress with a vagine, but she's pretty cool, easy on the eyes, and she was awesome in the first 2 underworlds!  i was really hoping that there was a new top-tier action/sci-fi/fantasy/gore/w/e but i'm pretty sure that we're gonna just have to be happy with 2 good one's out of the brand.  thanks, yes, but i can't help but feel like there could've been a lot more and i've abandoned hope since we got 1 stinker, and then another consecutively, and not many film franchises recover from that because they were only created from towels being thrown in.<br /><br />i was embarrassed that i bought it, i was embarrassed that i got someone to watch it with me.  i really did apologize.  i actually threw it in a box in the corner and then put the lid on it, and then put another box on top of that one.<br /><br />just don't do it, and if you must, don't purchase it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I LOVE NCIS!  Any season, any show - they're very well acted and work as a good team.  I wonder sometimes if they get along as good off the set as they do on.  I don't have many dreams I even remember but I've had a couple about 'Ziva' and 'McGee' and in them, we're just friends and we're doing every-day stuff.  I wish I could afford to buy every single episode but being retired and living on a fixed income, THAT'S not gonna happen!!
B008B68IUY|5.0|I bought this to use for doll photography but I have to say it's really sturdy and seems like it would hold up to lots of play as well.  Very cute addition to the Monster High playsets.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|What a original game . Played it with earbuds in and was taken away to world's  unknown. almost forgot I was at work. Great simple relaxing game. Worth the price.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|The story is about a band of well known people teaming up to defeat the evil adversary (fear itself). The story is well told with humor for all ages. The animation is good and the sound is excellent. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend it.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It is really a blast man. Great graphics feel like you are on the beach. It is just that you have to pay to get to the new roads or farther alone. Wouldcrather buy the whole game than restart from beginning that get boring . Hut fun non the less
0345803485|5.0|This book is definately a must read! I've been contemplating buying and reading this series for a long time, so I finally gave it. I can't wait to order the next one!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|it keeps you playing on and on! I play it while Im watching tv.  Very relaxing and fun. Keep making games like this
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great quality and price, one of the best headphones in that price range. Great sound, and not too heavy, includes a soft case.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|its the third season of bbt, if u love bbt, u will like this, if not you wont. not too much to say, it works fine
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I have to admit, this app was pretty good.  It kept me entertained for quite awhile.  I actually didn't want to put it down.  You will have to actually think in this one.  I had to use the guide a couple of times.  Twice because I didn't have a clue on what to do, but others because I was just stuck.  So bravo to G5!  Another good game.<br /><br />Beware - even though this game says FREE, it is NOT.  It costs $4.99.  But again, it is worth it, it's not a short game.<br /><br />I do recommend this.game.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|i mean if i were you, i would buy every season of bbt, great show, especially to nerds like me who see this on a daily basis
B002LFPAUC|5.0|When in doubt .... watch Fawlty Towers ... boubt will vanish in no time at all , no matter your age .
B0058O84G0|5.0|I couldn't put it down!! Ken Follett has again produced a captivating read. His impeccable research into historical events combined with the realism of his fictional storyline produces a believable exciting tale.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|Although I own several Seiko watches and have great respect for their quality and design, I would never buy an automatic, even this one at this price.  They don't need a battery, but they do need periodic service and they have to be worn most of the time.  The mechanism is delicate and easy to damage.  In these days of solar watches that only have to be left where light will shine on them and only have to be reset twice a year when the time changes because they are so accurate, I find it difficult to understand why there is still a market for automatics.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I love this site. I bought the first season because I have recently been watching it I tv and I just can't get enough. I'd you like crime shows this is one of the best. Simon Baker is exquisite as Patrick Jane. His role is really captivating and I really good into trying to figure out what emotions he was feeling even though he hardly ever says. I just ordered season three and I can't wait to get it and watch it. ASAP.
B004QX07G4|5.0|first book of ellen's I've read, but is exactly what I would want from her - clever, funny, and perfect
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|out of all the games that I have played. this is one of the most entertaining one.. Its so exciting I would highly recommend this app
B009VA1FN6|2.0|It was a shallow, romantic pot-boiler with little intellectual stimulation. The theme and characters could have had much more gravitas.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love thus game so much i could marry it!!! If i ciukd this would be my number 1 game. My friends always ask to play it
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I've always wanted to read this but I never got the chance and now that I have it's one of my favorites!!!!!¡¡¡¡¡
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just downloaded this game. It is quite addicting but also very odd. It's quite possible to play without spending money if you're patient
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|I bought this one before, not only it works for Flight Simulator....it works also for Train Simulator 2013! Now I have both and love it so much I feel like I'm really driving my train! Get it! Its worth it!<br /><br />I made a Tutorial on youtube how to get it to work!
034580404X|3.0|the entire 3 books is just about sex. too much sex no real plot to make a real interesting book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great game. Be sure to read the help first and plan your city before you begin. Good luck.
B0007ZIYM4|5.0|Just her playing is a treat to listen to, but the Four Seasons are just phenomenal. It's so different then the other interpretations of the Seasons, but it's original and oh so wonderful to listen to. I bought this CD when I was 10 or 11 (from SAVERS for 5 dollars plus tax) and I haven't regretted it unlike the other sour comments left. It's one of the only things that make me feel \\"fjdkasjfiosjfsdifj\\" for a lack of a word but by any other name would feel as trans inducing. Hats off to you Ms. Janine Jansen.
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|If you like the Wall Street movies you'll like this. Kevin Spacey is actually a good guy for the most part this time.
0321885112|4.0|The book comes with a code access to view a series of videos that demonstrate using sketchnotes to make you note taking more memorable.  The book has great ideas.  I knew I couldn't draw...however, I can sketchnote and this book proved it to me.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After hearing so much about Downton Abbey,I had to see it. I started watching season one and have been hooked since. I LOVE IT!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Fast moving drama, that slowed long enough for reflections. Denzel Washington was amazing to watch as an addicted person who nearly lost his soul.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|This Blu- ray 3D was a great movie to watch in 3D.I would highly recommend this 3D movie to anyone.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I just re-read this book and upgraded my review from 4 to 5 stars.  It was just as fun the second time around, and I still laughed, cried and cheered with the hero.  I see that it's now being published properly, which I imagine takes care of the editing and grammar problems I found in the first incarnation.  I look forward to future stories from this author with great anticipation, possibly another with clever, funny Mark Watney?
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|CLANCY DOES IT AGAIN.  Great thriller set in CHINA.  TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGING AND FULL OF INTERNATIONAL INTRIGUE.  A GOOD IDEA AND FUN TO READ
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I feel like there's a little too much going on on the screen....I know young people are used to this but I am 60 and need to keep it simple.  But it's really fun when you wanta break from a chore or something, and the program grades you and helps you improve.  I went from a D to a C the first time I tried it.  FUN.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Obviously a nice story but I came away feeling a lot of embellishments were added to this story.  Zero Dark Thirty is much better plus it has the added bonus of offing Bin Laden.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is a good beginner program for the kindle fire.  I have since up-graded to another program that is more sophisticated and more usable for me--I do lots of design work for my business as a working textile artist designing and selling silk scarves.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|I think once you know how these movies play out it makes it all a little scarier, but there are only one or two scenes that really gave me the goosebumps. It is scary enough to make sure you know your neighborhood kids!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Picoult many twists and turns in her stories keep one turning the pages to get to the ending which is always a surprise.
B009JTCBLE|5.0|Classic 70's hard rock made in 2012.  I love the circle and the Giver is like Led zep. I totally recommend
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This movie ROCKS !!!!  I know this movie has received many mixed refiews and that everyone has their own opinion about it.  This is mine and I can't wait for the next two movies in the series to hit the theaters.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Cute, fun game! Takes me back to<br />Mario Bros. I would definitely  recommend<br />This game, the levels are short but that's okay<br />It's still fun.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|I don't know what to tell you other than this movie is FANTASTIC !!!!  It has action, great storyline and great acting.  I could be a little biased as I am a retired veteran.  I recommedn this movie to everyone.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Wonderful Series!<br /><br />Thank you for offering it through Amazon Prime!<br /><br />Amazon Prime is the BEST AND WORTH EVERY PENNY<br /><br />texchick
B00AO686MY|5.0|This is a great movie that was only made better by being in Blu-ray.If you loved the DVD version then the Blu-ray version will blow you away.  This is a must have movie for everyone of all ages.
1616550414|4.0|Great buy if you like Zelda.  A thing to note is it's a coffee table style book, meaning it's pretty big.  Has a lot of great artwork and information in it for all the recent Zelda games.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Great story and great acting !!  Just plain FANTASTIC !!!!  I recommend this movie to everyone.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed !!!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Finally, a great shooting game like the old time arcade games I used to love.  Easy controls, plenty of action and variety.  A blast!
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|I didn't feel that this movie lived up to all the hype that it has received from the press and movie awards.  It is very predictable and, little action after the first 30 minutes.  It really didn't hold my attention very well.  The acting was okay but really outstanding to me.  Of course this is only my opinion.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am loving this game and can not wait to play it with my 6 year old granddaughters.the graphics are really realistic
B005LAIII0|5.0|This movie is Fantastic !! It leaves you wondering and guessing about which story is real and which one is not.I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I haven't finished this game yet but play a few rounds almost daily.  That is usually a sure sign  I'm hooked.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Season 10 has some great episodes; but my favorite has to be the &#34;Recovery&#34; episode.  I thought the episode was very powerful in handling the end of Harper Dearing; but my favorite part of the episode was the personal connection for Abby.  I loved the way that she took the chance on meeting her brother and how well that turned out.  However, I think she should have let Gibbs go with her.  After all, Gibbs is her rock!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|So happy I can finally play on my kindle play I was excited to be able to compete with my friends,,,,,,,IT DOES NOT SYNC WITH FACEBOOK.....
B005PK56TA|5.0|I watched the entire season last weekend and was amazed on how well written it was. couldn't asked for a better cast.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|TinTin was an OKAY movie. I was a little disappointed, being it a Spielberg film. The plot was slightly confusing and jumped around but the animation was very well done.
0393088774|5.0|I fail to understand the right wing in fighting the economic policies promulgated by mr krugman which have proved<br />themselves over the centuries.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book a lot. I kinda wished the ending was a bit more elaborate, but nonetheless it kept me wanting to read more and turn the pages! Recommended it for my friends too x
0525421580|5.0|Painfully honest, funny, and heartbreaking at the same time. I loved the complexity to the characters. No one reads flat, and each and every one of them is built not only of their own flaws, but their strengths as well. It left me with the exhilarated feeling of energy that a truly great book always leaves me with, and I appreciate the authors for that.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|GREAT BOOK JEFF KINNEY YOU ARE THE BEST BOOK MAKER IN THE HOLE WIDE STINKING WORLD YOU ARE AWESOME JEFF
B003INBNXO|5.0|I've grown very fond of the characters Donnie Yen portrays.  Ip Man was an excellent display of his versatile talent and skill. The story-telling is wonderful, weaving together the tale of a master of self-control, honor, and dignity.  Humorous at times, heart-wrenching at others, I delighted in watching this musical/poetic journey...and this is just the beginning.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|We have watched this series a couple times.  Love it!  Still can't believe the ending.  Season 4?  Please?  Thanks again Amazon.
0385344333|1.0|I wish there was a way to give no stars.<br />I've loved the Reacher books - not this one.<br />Gave it up after about 15 pages.<br />This does not bode well for the future of Jack Reacher.
0061906220|5.0|My 4 year old LOVES Pete the Cat.  He came home with one from the school book fair so I have bought others.
159102594X|4.0|One thing about the First Law series is that it is the most sarcastic series you will ever read.<br />Second is that all of the fantasy standards are turned around someone that looks good is bad someone that looks bad is... well he is still bad but he might try to be good once in a while.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The characterization is top notch. A lot of time and effort went into the main characters.<br />A lot of twists, trust no one to be the good guy.<br />Very fast pace, no down time, You can finish this in a few days if you get hooked.<br /><br />Cons:<br />At first the sarcasm and self mocking of the story telling is fresh, but eventually it gets a little stale.<br /><br />Still this is a very good book in a very good series.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|love this book. i am so excited to get it for free to have on my phone. one always needs a little jane austen at one's fingertips.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game, cool graphics, with challenging but forgiving gameplay.  Kind of like a modern take on the old school space invaders. Runs perfectly on my Nexus 4
B0007ZD6YK|3.0|Directed by David Yates, I thought it would be better but I guess a director can only do so much w/the script.  It was OK though
B008YKGQR4|5.0|It is a fast way of seeing the whole page and not just the short version. I enjoyed checking my FF on the kindle
B0034G4P4O|3.0|This may have been popular in the early 1900s but these days, it's just kinda cute and the animation is fantastic
B008VVT51U|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie, It is funny and a little bit sad. It was one of the most delightful films I have seen in awhile.  I just loved the characters, played by some of my most favorite actors. I highly recomend this film to all.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Delivery of an fine film on the release date as promised.  Thank you Amazon Prime!<br /><br />Well cast and acted , and as always for Peter Jackson and team, beautifully filmed on gorgeous locations and imaginative sets with great costumes and effects..  Another ripping tale for Tolkien fans and others.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|One starts out hoping the author can describe his experience well enough to convince the reader of the reality of Heaven.  It would be nice for once and for all to be absolutely convinced that it is true.  The story is supported by medical terminology so convincingly by the neurosurgeon author that a non-medical person cannot disprove it.  One wants to believe but feels in the end that the story can neither completely prove nor disprove the afterlife.  In the end the story, though fascinating, raises a lot of questions one perhaps cannot have answered in this life.  Persons who have experienced near death experiences cannnot be denied their belief in the afterlife.  I just wish their conviction could be so clearly easily expressed that it would be acceptable to the rest of us.
0345803507|5.0|Interesting and different book. Kept my interest.Very dfferent than any other book I have read. I would  recomment this bbok
B009KEN87O|4.0|This a fun game. It is a cross between Space Invaders and Astroids. Nostalgic while still fresh. I see many hours of fun with this game.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Earbuds, while effective in reducing noise level, are the enemy of all of those who truly enjoy the full-on &#34;BASS&#34; experience I get from my music. They also fit much more naturally in the ear and the sound quality is wonderful/top notch. They don't last super-long (because I abuse my headphones by never taking them off, even when sleeping) but at this low price, you willl still get your money's worth and then some!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A 4.5 really and so wonderfully told by a number of cancer ridden teens and their families. Funny, sad,poignant and so believable in feeling that I felt I knew hazel and Gus. Loved it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Plus something extra. It combines a number of retro games such as Space Invaders millipede and asteroids. Can't wait to see what's going up
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|....all at the same time! Easy but challenging at the same time but highly addictive. Simple concept with good upgrades and options. Good times.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|I think a lot of people watched this movie expecting to see a more straight forward history of the early days of Scientology. However, movies like that often have a shelf life of about one viewing. The performances in this movie are amazing. Most of all, Phoenix's. Which has to be one of the best portrayals I've seen onscreen in years.
B005M5OSBK|4.0|Love Pink Martini and this CD.  Especially like that it takes several of their most loved songs and compiles them into 1 CD
6304711905|5.0|This movie is great, one of my favorites of all time. Watch it on a big screen with surround sound. It is the bomb.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I feel like I have gone back in time. remember the game you grew up with, this is similar. Try it you will like it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I found you can choose 2 sounds.  Like your favorite rain, adjust  the volume,  and add wind chimes, adjusting that volume.  The ability to do that just makes a good app even better.  I bought it for the binaural beats.  So far I've only tried the one for dreamless sleep,  and it worked fine.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm a Pinterest addict...I have the app loaded on my Kindle Fire, iPhone, and Windows Nokia Phone so I always have access.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the book it is the best book I've ever readings so exhilarating and intense . THE HUNGER GAMES
B00797MB0O|3.0|only watched a few minutes-havent had time to finish-hop to complete at a later date-still intered in watching-hope  to soon
B0057GYOA4|1.0|DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!<br /><br />This is a remastered version of \\"Nevermind\\" and it is HORRIBLE.<br /><br />The sound of Nirvana that was on the original \\"Nevermind\\" album that was perfectly mastered and perfectly produced by Butch Vig and recorded at Sound City DOES NOT exist on this recording.  All of the songs are missing the original sound that made this album great.<br /><br />Remastering this album is just like someone going back and remastering the original Rage Against the Machine album that was also recorded at Sound City.<br /><br />If it is PERFECT, don't screw with it!  You can't beat PERFECTION!!<br /><br />Music recorded at Sound City on the very rare NEVE console using tape and actual talent are VERY FEW.  Please, Please, Please, SAVOR them as they are supposed to be savored.  Don't support a crappy remaster that is nothing like the original recording.<br /><br />BUY THE ORIGINAL ALBUM!  You will not be disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|hard to put it down. Just want to keep playing. The hard levels are really hard unless you have a stylus so your u can see what you are doing on the screen.
0765357151|5.0|Well. I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book, because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to enjoy the movie the way I did.<br /><br />Because the book is astounding.<br /><br />There are so many aspects of it that make it unique. The vampires themselves are incredibly intricate creations; they're hybrids of lore and science. A bacteria that destroys them and yet allows them to live even after death. The way that Robert studies them is also interesting because he has no scientific background. He just goes to the library and gets as many books as he can to try and piece everything together.<br /><br />Then there's Robert. The book spans three years, and over those years he has several different types of breakdowns. He loses the will to live, gains it back, is racked with guilt at having survived, desperate to kill as many vampires as he can, curious about what caused this epidemic, and a raging alcoholic as well as smart enough to install a generator and build a hot house to grow garlic.<br /><br />Robert is a man living in complete isolation. He talks to himself, fights with himself, berates himself. When he sees another living creature he does everything he can to cure it, then respectfully bury it. He kills indiscriminately, but abhors violence. It's this incredible mixture that makes him retain his humanity no matter how hard he tries to bury his past.<br /><br />The vampires are monstrous, and terrifying. The ending is shocking and sad. Basically it's one of the best books I've ever read. And it's very very short (unlike Dracula) which is nice. Just be careful because when you get the version I got, I didn't realize there were also a series of short stories tacked on at the end (which are very good in their own right).
B003JTHXOK|4.0|First time reading Nichlas Sparks, but it won't be the last. Very interesting twist and turns. Grabs your attention from beginning to the end!
B007L5GDGW|2.0|This game could be fun, like Marble Madness...a game from my past.  The controls were too touchy making it too difficult for me.  Deleted.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A very good, down to earth, explanation of why our fighting men do what they do.  Chris Kyle, rest his soul, is like many of the men and women I worked and served with in the military and 30 plus years in Law Enforcement.  The book, written in the first person singular, gives in site to the views and feelings of one individuals love of God, County and Family.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|This was a fun puzzle game.  It took some thought once you got past the first few levels.  I am a chemist so I like the little flask on the icon.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This little sharpener is great. Sharpened my knife as soon as I pulled it out of the package and she worked perfect.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT IS THE BEST GAME OF THE CENTURY AND I RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHOULD ADD THE NETHER TO MINECRAFT POCKET EDITION!<br /><br />P.S., ADD MORE ITEMS/MOBS BECAUSE THE POCKET EDITION SHOULD BE LIKE THE COMPUTER VERSION.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love this book!  All women need a hero:)  Such a sweet love story-typical of Nichols Sparks!  I would read it again!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I Have used this many times over the years and find it very accurate and easy to navigate. Very user friendly
B000FC1PNE|4.0|I have read all that Julia Quinn has written about the Bridgertons and just love the series.Looking forward to starting the next series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy made me laugh made me cry made me so angry at times. I feel connected to Katniss. Beautifully written. I love being able to lose myself in a good book.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This is the classic tale of science fiction that presents the idea of the end of Man but our ascension to a greater potential. I particularly liked the concept of racial memory of what was thought from the past on an event in the far future. If this sounds confusing, just read this tale and it will all make sense. This is classic intellectual science fiction at its best.
0062014536|2.0|--------May contain spoilers--------<br /><br />I was very frustrated by this book. It was an ok read in the beginning. I anticipated this book for a while. It was not what I expected. I was told by a friend that I would be angry at the end. She was correct. THERE WASN'T AN ENDING!!!!!Like seriously why even write a third book if you are not going to resolve anything! Way to much going on without any answers. Whats the point of bringing Alex back? Lena and Alex did not interact. IMO it was also pointless to bring back her mother. The first books were so good.This last book ruined it for me. Hana's perspective was interesting but there wasn't a resolution there either.-_-
B002O1TMI4|5.0|I really enjoyed this album. It was one of the better ones the muse came out with. It also contains what I think we're a bunch of hit songs that didn't get much to any radio play.<br /><br />If you like the muse this album does not disappoint.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|My nephew is taking karate and he enjoys watching karate movies.  He is 10 yrs old and had not seen &#34;The Karate Kid&#34; movies and I told him about them.  I gave him the collection as a gift and he was so excited.  I loved the movies and I enjoy that he loved them also.
B004MSWLU8|5.0|this book is a must to read<br />so sad, yet beautiful story<br />Anne Frank was a brave girl<br />received the book on time
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green simply captures the reader from the very first chapter. I was captivated by the story line and the characters!
1593272790|1.0|No description of how to put models together.  It only describe sizes and shapes of Legos. I don't see why these books were published.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|BEST TV SHOW EVER. I AM SO ADDICTED TO THIS SHOW. I LOVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH. IM OBSESSED! BEST
B009KEN87O|5.0|Nice gameplay, good sound effects, good physics. What I really enjoyed was that when you drag around the screen your ship/shooter is not right under your finger and therefore invisible.
B000USU6VU|5.0|This is a wondeful movie-- anyone who has not seen it is really missing a treat.  This great movie by John carpenter is a must for  any serious collection
0143039431|5.0|This was purchased to give to our Granddaughter because this book is a classic......and it is important reading and a learning experience.......
B00AOOIIVA|4.0|My son has watched the movie about 15 times & he is still enterained by it. I also enjoyed the movie
9056912445|5.0|I own several endgame books and this is the newest.  So far I am pleased and am particularly fond of the &#34;common traps&#34; that an expert player may try on me in some endgames, so as not to fall for them.  Or if I do at least if I do fall for one, I can say AHA I remember that trick.
B0026772N8|5.0|This mite be one of the best books I have ever read in my life, realy hits home with this one.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|I did order this this book so I can't rate it.<br />x x x x x x x x x
B001UV4XHY|3.0|The movie, as a movie, is ok.  However, if you really loved the books, you will be disappointed.  Far too many unnecessary deviations from the book.
B009O07NDY|5.0|It's an amazing soundtrack from an awesome movie. This is a must have for anyone who loves the LotR trilogy
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Very good fun for adults and kids with a great message be who you are and do what you were made to do
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great movie. Well done. Lots of suspense:). The actors were doing a good job. Provides a good deal of adrenaline.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am very happy to have the seasons in my video library. Without a doubt, I will watch them all again!
B00BQUUH7E|1.0|It looks fun but crashes to my desktop before I can play it. :(<br />I get through the first two screens then poof. I'm back at my desktop. I know It is attempting to open the Amazon App Store because the process is left running after the crash.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book is great  first and second were also great especially if you like action books that is the end off rating
0385349947|5.0|Not only is Sandberg brilliant, but this book is inspiring and easy to read. I recommend it for men and women alike, as it provides such insight into our new societal norms around gender dynamic and roles in the workplace/home.<br /><br />Thanks Sheryl!<br /><br />Jen
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Graphics are great and run smoothly on my kindle fire hd. Gameplay is standard for the genre and the battle minigames are a great idea. My only complaint is that progress does not always save. I played the game several times today but, the last time I logged in, the buildings and units I spent time building earlier today were all gone.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I saw a lot of bad reviews when I first bought this product. Basically what you get is the 3D version of the movie on blu-ray (and the 2D version too in both formats). It lacks special features and does not contain the extended version.<br /><br />If you just want to see the theatrical release in 3D and don't care about any other features then buy this version and you will be very happy. If you wanted the special features and extended version then don't bother to purchase this and wait for another version to come out.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe is a show I could watch over and over again. Very sad the series was ended. Hope that they make a Fringe movie!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|They pass this off as free, but in order to do anything you need to pay.  It is geared towards children but in the fine print there are hidden costs.
0060531053|5.0|this book has a lot of information on beer, history,ingredients,styles and a lot of recipes to make a lot of different kinds of beer.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I first started watching the series on TV but then got hooked.  Good story line and cannot wait until season two finally gets released.  Thanks!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Being a Veteran I enjoy a good military story. It make me think about my time doing the war and how close the book is to actually what happen
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I loved the soundtrack.  Saw the movie first, then had to have the music.  You had the best price and I received it very quickly.
B008K7DIEA|4.0|I heared about the book from a Preacher and decide to find what it was about. I would recommend to any one interest in how the mind work.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|This is my second Luke Bryan cd- and won't be my last!  Every song on this cd is fantastic.  I'm going to order some of his older music as soon as I finish this review-! Highly recommend this cd to anyone - you will not be disappointed!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not a bad follow up. Very interesting twists in plot. Now I'm sucked in to reading the last book. Found this book a little slower than the first one.
B00004CXMW|1.0|Sold me a foreign copy of the DVD and I can't watch it on any DVD player. So unless I got to Europe I can no view the movie, seems like I got ripped off pretty good
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I felt that this movie was AWESOME PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE PEI PEI PIE PIE P

B008476HBM|4.0|I'm a slow read and like to absorb it gradually.  I'm still reading it and the more I read the better I like it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|wHAT? Is what I ended up saying by the end of the last word. Every time you think something was going to happen, u are completely shocked by the redirection of the plot. Really great story.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great! Fall in love with the book as I read it. A must read for anyone believing in love pure love.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is a great series.  The character are very well defined and believable, even the unusual ones.  You really get to care about them, which is very important.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I like Tom Selleck in this role and like the character of Jesse Stone. It's just good entertainment & worth watching more than once!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great set of books.  A little dark, but so is life sometimes.  Ms Collins is a talented storyteller.  The world and the people are very real.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I watched a couple of episodes just out of curiosity and got solidly hooked. The characters are believable and the bizarre events that they take on are presented in a way that grabs your interest and keeps it until the end. Sometimes one episode is not enough and I wind up watching two at a sitting. If this was a book, you would call it a page turner.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is a great ending to an exceptional set of books.  The good guys win and the bad guys lose, but in a believable way.  You don't feel like the ending is contrived at all.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This app had me revisiting my video game past.  It is just like I remember.  I especially like how the text is in the retro typeface, and the spacecrafts look like Lego creations.<br /><br />Fun app that holds your interest.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|We have &#34;family night&#34; movies every Friday or so where we pop popcorn and sit down and watch a movie together.  This movie was one of the best in a LONG time.  We were really happy with Hotel Transylvania, but THIS movie almost blew it away, in my family's opinion.  My children (both 5 and 7) were just enthralled with RotG.  My husband and I were laughing and just having FUN!!  The only negative I have to say, and it isn't even truly negative, is that after watching it once, I wanted to watch it a second time because I felt like there was a lot going on.  But we watched it again the next night and were delighted once more...plus we picked up on some stuff we missed the first time.  Anyway.  Awesome movie.  So glad I purchased this.
B0074VA2T2|2.0|While this app has a great concept (teaching very young kids to count), I found the delivery of the lessons very unimaginative.  The lessons need some pizzazz and energy to grab and keep the interest of young children.<br /><br />Issues I had with the app include:<br /><br />* There is no hungry caterpillar!  The title of the app is the Hungry Caterpillar but the caterpillar does nothing.  It sits unmoving in the corner of the screen and never interacts.  It just looks like a logo.<br /><br />* Adult supervision is need for a child to use the app.  While the actual lesson can be handled by a child (pointing to the correct number of items), transitioning from one screen to the next and one lesson to the next is too advanced for a child.  It would have been better to also make the screen/lesson advancement automatic or better yet make the advancement a lesson in itself.<br /><br />* The game is a little boring even for a child.  The child listens to the instructor's voice and point to the correct number of food items.  This part works but there is no positive reinforcement when the answer is correct.  There needs to be some fireworks, some spinning fruit, a caterpillar that claps and cheers when the child gets the answer correct.  Without the positive feedback the game gets very boring and monotonous in a short period of time.<br /><br />* The graphics are colorful, but some of them don't look like the food they are trying to represent. And children might have difficulty identifying some of the foods like salami.<br /><br />So in summary I feel like the app works well and functions as a learning tool, but it just needs some pizzazz to make it more interesting.
1419705849|5.0|I loved it because of the humor.  The ending is really good and not expected.  My daughter is a third grader and loves this series.
B009MO5E10|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The plot was a little thin: bicycle messenger must deliver a letter before a 7:00 pm deadline while being chased by a corrupt cop who wants the letter for himself.  But it was fun, action packed, and the bicycle tricks/culture was a change from the ordinary chase scenes.  The acting was well done, and the characters were interesting.  The corrupt cop was the best of the bunch.  He had this attitude like \\"Are you really going to make me kill you?  You know killing you will really spoil my day.  Just do what I want and we will both be happy.\\"  He was hilarious.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about the movie was the manipulation of the time line.  Characters were introduced and interacted for a time, but then suddenly the story would go back in time and you were shown how and why each character ended up in their current predicament.  I know the trick has been done before but it was handled well.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I bought this for my husband as part of his Christmas gift.  He loves it.  He loves that it is easy to mute if he needs to for a minute or two.  I love that I don't have to hear some of the annoying talk that goes on in the games.  Other headsets you could hear it even if you didn't have the headphones on.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|This is the best set of songs RT has put out in a very long time. Some terrific numbers, specifically The Rival, and Salford Sunday. Terrific guitar work spread throughout the two CDs. Wonderful
B006G2124E|5.0|All young adults need to see this movie it's touches my heart. and is a life lesson amen please view.
B00004T9VY|1.0|OK, let's agree that his music is good.  Let's remember the \\"innocent\\" Caat Stevens.  The musician who sings the songs on the Cat Stevens album, who sings about love and peace and all the other good stuff that makes one feel better morphed into an Islamic jihadist who seriously and sincerely, according to his own words, supports the murder of other artists for \\"insulting Islam\\".  If he supports the murder of Salman Rushdie, as he says he does, you can be sure he supports the murder of others as well, and he supports a lot of other noxious causes that, if carried to fruition, would spell the return of dark ages for folks like you and me.  If he supports militant Islam, which he says he does, then he supports the denigration of women to second class citizens.  IF he supports militant Islam, he supports forced conversions and death to infidels.  He has wizened up up bit from his early days of conversion; he is a bit more savvy and watches his words and sweetens them up a bit when challenged, but he has not renounced his beliefs and those beliefs run counter to everything that we in the West, who cherish freedom and liberty, believe in.  It is for this reason I will not buy his music or listen to it.  That does not mean it is bad music, but I  won't listen to it. I'd rather spend my music time listening to music of others, and there's plenty of good music out there.  NO need to support a man who thinks his co-religionists have the right to murder in the name of religion.
0670827592|5.0|I laughed out loud at this hilarious take on the original! Also read it to a group of second graders and they loved it.

B007TXN4TK|1.0|THAT IS A BUNCH OF POOP TO GET YOU INVOLVED TO LEARN THIS AND IT IS NOT FREE, VERY MISLEADING

B004W2UBYW|5.0|As a computer professional for the past 35 years,  I knew very little about Jobs, and never really had the desire.  I wrote my first program in an experimental high school program in 1970, so my experience with computers came from the world of UNIX and Dartmouth BASIC, and I had little interest in what Apple did, except for their pioneering WYSIWYG and great printing with the help of a little known company called Adobe.  For those of us programming Business applications,  Apple was so far removed from that bubble, that those of us making a living as programmers were often only watching in the periphery.  All that changed in the late 1990's, and now the Apple influence is impossible to ignore.  Love him or hate him, an inside look at how this man changed the culture of the world, is a must read for anyone who is at all curious as to why Apple is such a big deal; or for that matter, why Jobs is such a big deal.  A real human portrayal, with all his best and worst attributes, and a much more in depth explanation as to what made the man tick.  I doubt that I would ever have wanted to have lunch with the guy, but I'm glad I now know more about him.  A fast read, and compelling.  A must read to round out your understanding of high tech and how it is often planned and implemented.  Not what I was expecting, in a good way.
B009O2XY12|3.0|THIS GAME IS OK, I LIKE QUICK GAMES AND IT KINDA FIT THE BILL. i MIGHT KEEP IT AROUND NOW

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't do reviews...ever.  This Saga was so good I felt compelled to share my excitement. My short and sweet review is read it, you won't regret it.  Doesn't matter if you are a Science fiction fan or not.  It's about the story, not the genre.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I DO HAVE A PROBLEM? I GET TWO MAIL NOTICES AND BOTH ARE YAHOO ON THE KINDLE. i DON'T NECESSARILY WANT MY EMAIL IN BOX TO MY KINDLE, I'D RATHER HAVE IT ON MY PC ONLY, SO IF I NEED TO PRINT AND ON PC ITS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO GET TO OTHER SITES WITH MY YAHOO TOOLBAR AND FAVORITES. HELP HELP HELP HELP HELLP
1568363931|5.0|Love the recipes in the book.  I've tried several but haven't had much time to really sit down and make some more of them.  I love japanese food and I have a Zojirushi Bento Jar which this works really well for.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A very good book. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, artfully written. Well done!

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks makes his characters come alive in yourmind. You can put yourself in their lives as the events take place.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this app is wonderful and awesome you should download it this game is so fun and great download on phone tablet and other devices
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story keeps you guessing about the role of the main character and has an interesting twist at the end.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|Viktor Frankl wrote a philosophical classic here. It's a quick read, packed with insightful experiences and thoughts, and hugely motivational. A must read for everyone.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|My children like Bruno but he curses more than I expected here and definitely too sexual for their little ears.
0446547573|5.0|My kind of story.  I have always enjoyed Nicholas Sparks stories. Not so interested in seeing the movie now that I have read the book!  I had the book the day after I ordered it!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|funny funny funny funny funny. i think seth mcfarlin is a genious, was very good and jsut funny and actual had a story line,
B0055SWM08|2.0|I bought this because of the rave reviews. Many people say it is relaxing. I find  it frustrating, and quite irritating. Went through almost all the levels in a few hours.<br /><br />The levels I had trouble with DO NOT HAVE SOLUTIONS ON FACE BOOK. I am UN-liking the page immediately. I don't like to be nagged into giving a rating. I really detest having to LIKE a face book page with the promise of something that is not there.<br /><br />On the upside the music is nice. But I'm nearly deaf, so I leave my sound off, so I don't irritate others with it.<br /><br />The design is great.<br /><br />Game play is boring.<br /><br />I won't be paying for version two. I could have spent the cash on a good read.<br /><br />Still looking for those solutions.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|was ok but once you seen one there all the same. very perdictable which can cause them to be a little boring.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Entertaining but just seemed like loose anecdotes with no central theme to tie down the various characters caught into the trap. Man eating car? Come on, Stephen King! You can do better!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my kids love it so do I a horse fo the family good to kill time all kinds of hores to chouse from
B007IK44CK|3.0|I would watch this again sometime. Script, acting, plot, effects all good, some of the scenes near the end were a bit tedious ( car elevator - suitcase scene), but all in all a good action flick.
B000007492|5.0|Listening to some of my favorite Supertramp songs it troubled me that several in my previous compilations were not the original full length versions.  In particular it bugs me when people cut off either the start or ending of Take the Long way Home.  This album has very nicely digitized full length versions of my favorites.  I went through my iTunes collection and replaced those other versions with these.<br /><br />When I first noticed the shorter versions, I went to play this on my iPhone and realized that I only have the vinyl for the originals and not a digital version of Breakfast in America, so I needed to get this version to fill in those original full length versions of my favorites.  The benefit of buying this collection means I picked up a few other really wonderful songs too.  I prefer to buy the digital versions and not bother trying to record from the old records.<br /><br />I want to mention buying this through Amazon instead of iTunes and other sources.  I have really grown to appreciate Amazon's service, delivery and the incredible thought they have put into their music management system.  You can buy this song, immediately listen to it via the Amazon Cloud player, but even nicer is the ability so simply click to download it and Amazon crafts a download that not only downloads the original ready to go MP3, but also imports it for you into your iTunes if you also have that installed on your system, with album art and all.  Talk about a nice setup, very well done Amazon!<br /><br />5 stars, great songs, great music and great to buy it through Amazon.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood just keeps getting better as he gets older...  And newcomer Justin Timberlake did a pretty decent job, too.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|A well acted, directed and written movie with plenty of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat, complete with a happy ending!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Fast shipping, and my product arrived in perfect condition, not much else I can really say towards Amazon. The show is amazing, but I can't give them credit for that, of course!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I really have enjoyed this movie feature.The special features have interviews with the hostages,Tony Mendez,Jimmy Carter,the Canadian prime minister,and show clips of the time this was going on.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This was a remarkably stunning film to look at in 3D theatrically . I only managed about fifty some minutes though . I walked out because (even as an Anglophile) i could not understand much of what was being said on screen . Yes , i'm nearly fifty and have some hearing loss owing to the nature of the work i've most often done . Reading the script truly aided me in getting into the (admittedly familiar) chord . A chord i'm too familiar with but a very agreeable riff non the less . I didn't read the various books , so i'm not coming at the picture from that perspective . I really liked the fella who plays the central Hobbit . As a more mature character , i found him more relatable . I could rattle off negatives . I prefer to put on my Sennheiser headphones and enjoy the tale however . Love the evil Orc and so on . It won't win you over if you're not inclined , to be sure . Give it another try if you find yourself in some things i've written . Fun . If you require additional incentive , study the many film blogs contained herein . Amazing .
1616550414|5.0|Nothing else to saying. &#34;Amazing&#34; express everything I feel about this book. Great cover, great job!!! An amazing guide of The Legend of Zelda ever!
B003B02O14|5.0|THIS WAS A FAST READ AND THRILLING TO THE END.  I DIDN'T LIKE THE ENDING HOWEVER, BUT IT WAS WORTH THE READ!
B004132HZS|5.0|This is an unusual take on the Sherlock Holmes saga with different twists on old favorites. This series is excellent and a must see.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I feel like most soundtracks always have songs that &#34;remind you&#34; of the movie and the feel of it but this one has the actual songs that played throughout the movie!! every time i listen to it its like watching the movie again and again! Great songs, great movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Okay so from initially downloading the game I must say I LOVE IT!!! It gives an adrenalin rush to my brain and i feel like I'm actually running
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm a big Stephen King fan.  I've read most of his books, and there were very few I disliked.  However, there are only a few Stephen King Books that really stand out for me as Great.  This is one of them.  I put this book right up there with The Stand, which I think is one of the best books I have ever read.  I recommended this book to a friend of mine who was NOT a Stephen King fan, and she loved it.  It's one of those books you keep thinking about even after you're through reading it.
B001HBWY8M|5.0|Cute and sweet.  You don't have to think a lot, just mindless entertainment, but it's one I will watch again and again.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun so far but a lot if interruptions and u don't like having to post in Facebook to progress. Will continue in and see how  it goes
B00138KDO6|5.0|I downloaded this album along with their first self-titled album because Amazon was having a sale and I bought it mainly because I liked \\"Guerrilla Radio,\\" and I expected to like their self-titled album more. Turns out I was wrong. While not every song is fantastic, I love listening to tracks like \\"Born of a Broken Man,\\" \\"Sleep Now with the Fire,\\" and \\"Calm Like a Bomb.\\" I've now ended up listening to this album far more than their first effort and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's even a casual fan of Rage Against the Machine. Very good album.
B00015HVI8|5.0|Came when expected, packaging good.  Everything it said it was.  Good quality video's.  No problems at all.  I am all digital now and might not buy DVD's again though.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I loved this movie it was terrific would watch it over again its not a movie you could just watch one time .I would  recommend it to anyone.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game because you get to see a lot of dinosaurs.I think everybody should get and love this game!!! :)
0783235380|4.0|Sandra Bullock has done it again , I have never watched a movie of hers that I did not like .
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The interaction of characters, the depth of settings, and the smooth transitions from dialog to narrative made the book easy to read and difficult to put down. I felt like I was along for the hunt, quietly sneaking along the river banks wondering what would be the protagonists next strategy. The decisions that formed allies were the nervous leaps of trust they needed to be. The world of the district's is harsh fantastical and remarkably believable.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love angry birds. I like the different levels. When I loose, the birds give a smile. That makes me work harder to win. Thank you very much  for the games.
B002ZG99NG|4.0|So many have written up their opinions about the movie and a summary of the plot already so I don't need to be redundant.  I review only the quality of the movie's  transfer to blu ray.<br /><br />The video transfer is really very good, not a night and day difference between it and the standard def version but there is improved contrast and a richness to the skin tones and somewhat bleach bypassed color grading that was incorporated into the film.  I saw no obvious grain that could be distracting and there was a good amount of detail in the shadows and darker scenes.  The Town's extended version comes with 2 discs, one is for a digital copy that I have not downloaded.  On the label it says that it is for a limited time from date of release so I do not even know whether the disc, at this point, is even good or not.  There are also instructions provided on a sheet as to how to download to your PC or iTunes if you are on a Mac, which I am.  There is also a menu button that will, if pressed, bring up a small camera icon in the area that is letterboxes, so it is not over the film image itself, that will come on when an originally deleted scene has been put in.  The new scenes were not life and death type of scenes but they did add a bit more flavor to the film and were all worthy additions.  The menu does ask whether you want the theatrical release or the extended.  I only watched the extended version.  At no time did I see any artifacting during the film and, especially during the car chases where stair stepping might be noticeable, I saw none.  The MBPS compression really varied from as low as 9 to the low thirties.  The video transfer rates a 4.5 from me.<br /><br />The audio was a bit of a disappointment to me.  The film defaults to DTS MA 5.1 but the great majority of the film is spread across the front stage with very, very little of anything in the rears.  Even during the famous Nun car chase you would think that there would have been a great opportunities for audio panning from side to side and between the front and rear sound stages but there was none, no foleys, nothing.  Not until the last 30 minutes of the film were the rear speakers called upon for discreet channeling of audio effects.  While the DTS MA remains lossless and thus produces a rich audio environment stripped of the veil that lossy audio creates, I was let down by the lack of audio editing for most of the film.  Never the less, there is no need to keep your remote in hand as the volume levels for soundtrack and dialogue remain nicely stable.  I rate the audio a 3.5<br /><br />The extras were good with short documentaries on the town of Charleston, the many inhabitants of the town that had roles in the movie, Ben Affleck as a director and actor, creating the Nuns with Guns sequence, and more including your standard commentary over the film.  Unfortunately, there is a 'stop smoking' commercial and advertisements for other Blu Ray discs that just take up room on the disc and are a cause for greater compression.  I really hate paying for commercials.<br /><br />If you already have the theatrical version of The Town on Standard Def, I would recommend upgrading to the extended version as it just felt more complete to me and created greater insight into the character's thinking.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksio panning from side to side and between the front and rear sound stages but there was none, no foleys, nothing.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the game. I spend many hours playing angry birds. Sometimes I get angry. Even my husband like playing. I hope their are more free games like this.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Music, sound effects, and controls are really good. This is actually my first review over any app and that says a lot about what I think about this app
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I was so taken back by this movie I went out and bought the blue ray after watching it, very well done. The story was great and emotional ! the visuals were breathtaking, I loved it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book put what our nation's warriors  do for this country into perspective. I am grateful for each servicemember who puts their lives on the line every day.
B00514HDNW|3.0|Gripping at times, boring at others.  Definitely worth a read, but certain lulls dropped it down to 3 stars. Much better version of the movie however.
B004I744AS|5.0|Like everyone has already proclaimed - this IS truly as good as it gets. And it is completely FREE. Not just helpful with spellings but has Weather Forecasts; Horoscopes; Word Games; Quote of the Day; OH SO MUCH MORE THAN A DICTIONARY. You simply can't go wrong downloading this little/big app. You will have fun with it!

B003F3NEBG|5.0|The Blu-ray edition of my wife's favorite Jane Austen novel was not disappointing at all.  Not only was the picture/color better but the sound is much better as well.  All the better to hear the, well written, dialogue.  She is very happy!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I am a 30 year old amateur triathlete I would consider myself very fit but I would not say I am strong, I was only 150 pounds when I started mikes advice and programme on bulking up my goal weight is 175 pounds before I start to cut, but already only 4 weeks in to mikes programme I feel stronger and fitter than ever, my end goal is to be 175 pounds and have the strength and fitness I need to compete at a higher level, this book is no nonsense easy to read and above all mike tells the truth and in fitness that's all you need, I would also recommend the shredded chef to compliment this book as I have learned in this last four weeks your diet is everything In achieving your goals.
B00BQLSB3A|1.0|Stupid and boreing. I saw this movie when it first came out, I wanted to like it, but damn there is nothing scarey or thrilling about this movie. And a limited edition on bluray going for $139.00<br />who would be stupid enough to pay that much money for any movie. If you already have this on dvd it's good enough.
B000O59A2K|5.0|Me and my husband love John Wayne, we have a lot of his movies, did'nt have these two. Will be ordering more!!
B002JIOOB2|5.0|this movie is really a must see for all to watch,It has real life up and down's of couple's every day life as lesbians.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Lots of twists and turns.  But, I thought the ending was a little unrealistic.  But, it was a fun read.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game very good game I like the way it feels and kooks make more games like this one retro but at the same time modern
B005NNUKF4|4.0|Good album.  Very happy with this purchase.  Good quality files as always.  Would definitely consider purchasing more int he future.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|5/5 for excellent production value, execution, and acting. While I am not a traditional &#34;Masterpiece Classic&#34; audience member, I am drawn to the outstanding quality of this show!

B00BP4SJKI|1.0|I hated this movie when I was young, but decided to watch it again with my children. This movie is just not what I want influencing my kids or myself, Tinekerbell is a murderous wench, Peter Pan is a jerk and I found myself bored during most of this movie.
B001AXME2S|5.0|Good album.  Very happy with this purchase.  Good quality files as always.  Would definitely consider purchasing more int he future.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Love it.  Reminds me of retro galaxies LOVED that game too.<br />  Spent hours playing that one and will undoubtedly play this one endlessly.

075669812X|5.0|My nephew loved this book! He carries it with him everywhere and is constantly reading about the characters. I looked for weeks in the stores for this book before ordering but I could not find very many and the ones I found already had the bonus pieces taken out. It made a great gift.
B002POMLHY|5.0|Good album.  Very happy with this purchase.  Good quality files as always.  Would definitely consider purchasing more int he future.

B007SGM084|5.0|Love the story in print....If it follows suit and a movie is to be made, let's hope they can stay with the story line.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This game is lots of fun. Be careful, it can keep you occupied for a long time. Not too hard and not too easy either. Enjoy!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I just finished this book and want to start all over again.  Emotional, heartwarming and inspiring.  I loved it and will recommend it to everyone I know.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I love Catan.  While the initial investment can be a bit pricey for a tabletop game, it is definitely worth it.  I have only had this game for about a month, but I've played it upwards of 10 times, and it is a staple game to pull out when friends are over.  It's a simple game, and definitely easy to catch on.  The expansion pack is really helpful, but not entirely necessary for the beginner, and it's a great precursor to Cities and Knights, and other exciting variations!  Definitely a great game!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i Love it. ihave not had any problems from the app. it hasdifferent settings as well. great for cutting boredom!
B0076HNMU0|5.0|Who killed Laura Palmer?  Who cares? and does it matter? As the old saying goes--it is not the destination, it is the journey. The twists and turns in solving the mystery is TV at it's weirdest and it's best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It`s so much fun dodging trains, running from the man, and...EVERYTHING. If you like temple run, you will LOVE this game! Subway Surfers is a newer, hipper temple run. The characters are so fun, and the huver boards are so cool looking! Get this game even just to try it out (although, garuntee youll be hooked) ita free anyways!
B00001NFCY|5.0|this music is amazing and very relevant for todays youth.  the struggles between fitting in and making your own thing continue in our dark days of obsessive materialism, sex, and profanity.  Creed doesn't indulge but explains how sex can be misused and often how angry we get in our culture can lead to shame and even loss.  Also I found that the song wrong way speaks to a modern audience in ways few bands except maybe POD do.  I often find myself being afraid of the culture we live in but all you can do according to Creed is live your life the best you feel how.  these guys rock and roll with a good message and I find them to be one of the most underrated bands of the last 25 years.
B000F2O4MI|5.0|Was priced well as a used item, client shipped quickly.  Spanglish was a fun film, and has been watch 10 or more times.
B007XHWROK|5.0|Very Clean Music.  for parents looking to buy their son or daughter a new album this is fun stuff just as his last was.  Not sure what to totally make of the image their creating for Justin but this is a very solid album.  He has the abilities that you rarely see in an artist.  Awesome hip hop.  Hope Justin continues to shine.
B009KEN87O|5.0|omg you gotta get this game, I love the classics but this has a modern twist to it. love it :D
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|You must see this movie if you haven't.  With anti-Semitism growing more and more this is a must see and a must own.  We must never repeat the mistakes of the past like this Nazi movie.  shows the good in any situation.  Liam Neasons best role.  God bless.
B004UID2LC|4.0|this app does what its name says I haven't had the probleam that other people have been having mine still works great
1582701709|5.0|I did a gift exchange and they included a letter from me AND kept it anonymous. Very very helpful and nice! :D
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Just like all the other reviews said, this stands head and shoulders above most of the $5.99 sci-fi books on here that I've read recently. Outstanding writing and I especially loved the main character's humor in dire situations.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|It was evicting all the way through. Lots of twists and turns. Mark Wahlberg is fantastic as usual. A must see
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awesome because you can go any were you want when yo want and how you want.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Suspenseful from beginning to the end.  Wonderfully written.  Michael Connelly did it again.  I especially like the use of Bosch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great deal of fun and games in the past were not as good as this one<br /><br />So get it as soon as possible
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Easy install and download to Kindle Fire, graffics is good, and I enjoy playing the game. Would reccomend to anyone.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I've only been playing it a short time although so far is really great.  Love the graphics and I picked tilting my Kindle as form of steering.  So for it has been a blast!  I am thrilled to have this as free app of the day. The game reminds me of Mario kart. If you liked that game, you will like this one too.
1610390938|4.0|I purchased this book because it is required reading for the MIT economics course in &#34;The Challenges of Global Poverty.&#34;  I am glad to be taking this course, as it lead me to this book.<br /><br />The authors set our empirical data describing many specific issues of global poverty that governments and NGOs attempt to allieviate.  The authors detail randomized controlled experiments showing what works to allievate specific problems experienced by poor people, and what does not work.<br /><br />This is an excellent book to learn the facts about poverty world-wide, and to assist in devising policy strategies to allieviate many problems of the poor.  These problems are not pleasant, but there is no reason they cannot, and should not, be solved.
B009KEN87O|4.0|this is fun! I remember playing the when I was younger and I remember it being fun. now it has been upgraded a little and it is just as good as I remember.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|this is such a great story, didn't really read any reviews before starting this book, so i didn't have any kind of expectation going into it.  but what a wonderful surprise.... love the characters this author created and very well written. a difficult subject for everyone to ponder about.... a MUST read!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute game. We really enjoy it. I think it shows the work that goes into taking care of a horse.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|All around just a great read enjoyed it on the kindle passed a lot of time in airports waiting for flights.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I was given the chance to play this game along with two others and I have to say..... it is totally addictive!!!!  I had to be out of town in an area which did not receive good reception and offered something to help whittle down my time.  This is fun, entertaining and easy to get engrossed.  I'm thank my friend for allowing me to use their game and thanks again for buying it for me.
1577314808|5.0|For those looking spiritual growth this book is excellent.  I've recommended this book to many friends and family.  I bought it this time for my aunt.  The shipping delivery was faster than I expected!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this one as much as the second book.The end to this book was something that was alittle of a surprise.Wish  there was more. Now I am upset....what to read. I really hope the movies are as good as the second and third book..Fingers crossed
0345803493|3.0|It's badly written but finally getting some story elements in this second book. Oh my! It's getting a bit repetitive.
B007REV4T8|5.0|For action junkies like me the James Bond franchise doesn't disappoint.  I loved this movie when I saw it on the big screen and have watched several more times in the month I have owned on DVD.  I like that Daniel Craig creates a James Bond that is less playboy and more aggressive (killer???).  &#34;Skyfall&#34; is one of the best Bond movies ever!
B002RI9UBS|2.0|My husband read this book and said he didn't get it at all. So disappointed as I purchased it for him specially. Our granddaughter told us at Christmas that it was a wonderful book so maybe my husband is just-dare I say it-too old...
B001XVCX96|5.0|This movie was a very powerful one that stirs the emotion. It gave a realistic insight on what people will do to accquire a diamond. I was brought to tears when I saw how people had no regards to their country men, women, and children in the name of money from the sale of illegal diamonds. I felt the most compassion for the children who had(have) lost their childhood forever. I pray for the people of Africa that one day they will be able to love and respect each other
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I totally enjoyed Season 2 of Downton Abbey and can't wait to see Season 3. Love the setting of the Abbey and the period clothing, especially as it changes gradually over the years that Season 2 covers. Some day, I will visit Downton Abbey!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Very entertaining!! Really like this game!! I like the entire series. My daughter can play non stop and finds the game simple even fun.
B00AYHK7RU|4.0|I have only listened to this CD once.  I heard that is was the fastest selling CD in 2013, so being a big Bowie fan I had to check it out. It's okay, I think if I listen to it more it might grow on me.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I read this book over the busy holiday so it took me quite a while to get through it and it was so LONG.<br />It was a great read the characters were a delight.  I liked the fact that it held your interest even though it went back and forth in time.  I almost gave up on it, but could not resist discovering how it would turn out.  It was very well written.  I would give this book a four rating.  I read this on my kindle.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great program with unusually deep character development for the horror genre. Love jessica lang! Great actress with flexible character abiity.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This is the best diet book ever.  It works!  It is easy to use and fits into your everyday life.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|This is what I'm talk'in about. There is a lot of room here for growth with out stepping on the old series and also isn't too predictable in nature.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had to see what the fuss was all about, and now I know.  While certainly holding my attention, it was a shocking education.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game always seems to always challenge me!! And I love a great challenge. What makes it better is that it's FREE!!!! Get this GREAT game!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Love this movie . It is so worth it to buy. Its good for a lot of laughs. Make sure you get it
B0031RAOVY|5.0|THIS ONE IS A REAL TEAR BRINGER FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.............GET OUT THE POPCORN AND THE TOWELS.........EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A DOG LOVER..........
B005K17RU0|2.0|What an incoherent mess! I much preferred the simplicity of the old version. This one is too busy with tiny little black and white graphics.  Not obvious how to move from one day to the next. As I am looking at the daily forecast at 11:30 pm what is labeled as &quot;today&quot; looks like it is actually tomorrow but there is no way to tell for sure.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show has everything a turn of the century English drama should have. It's full of drama, of course, but it has that particular English humor & charm that leaps of the screen. The actors are all superb & I can't wait for season 4.
0767802519|1.0|I love this film, but Amazon includes reviews from different versions of the film on this one's product page. This is a FULL-SCREEN version of the film -- in other words, half of the movie has been cut off. If you're hoping to see the whole movie, search for &#34;Leon - The Professional (Uncut International Version)&#34;.<br />That said, Amazon was great at allowing me to return this junk, and instantly credited my account...so I immediately bought the real thing.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It does what it's supposed to do. It's twitter and I can get in and do what I need to do with no issues &#34;yet&#34; I probably just jinxed myself now though...lol.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|30 minutes into the movie I did not know what the plot was other than crash scenes and chases.<br />I tended to compare this with earlier bond movies that I totally enjoyed and compared to those my rating for this oneis zip.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It does what it is supposed to do and have had no issues with it on my kindle yet. Only thing is I can't figure out how to save pictures from it that I like to re post or save and keep for other things. That would probably just be me. On my phone you just hold your finger on the picture and it gives you the option to save it but on my Kindle Fire HD it tells me I can save as a contact pic and thats it so still working on trying to figure that out!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Incredible...what else is there to say?  Apparently more words are needed.  What a shame<br />I do believe that INCREDIBLE says it all.
0394716787|5.0|I love Edgar Allan Poe..this has his best works all in one book :)..I had the book years ago but after my Mom died it got lost in one of my many moves since
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|We love this game!! I love all of the new features and the graphics are great. You can unlock new sharks now too. Love it.Love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is extremely fun. great way to spend your spare time & relieve you of stress. Its fun fun fun!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've read books one and two so far and I'm completely captivated! Can't wait to read the third book...I'm hooked! Lol
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|awesome, just like the movie, the music from the first movie is to me by far the best, goods songs, good artists
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This was controversial but very beautiful and exquisitely told and engaging. Spectacular and vivid and the beautiful, Helen Hunt, spectacular.
B008B1VYP0|1.0|don't like bad language in music, didn't really want this cd somehow got it when I ordered the 'generic version'
B000294SFW|5.0|What more can be said about Motorhead? They are one of the greatest rock and roll bands to ever grace the stage. I was a huge Motorhead fan growing up and then sort of drifted away from them after the \\"1916\\" album came out.<br /><br />When Tower Records (remember them?) went into bankruptcy and were closing down their stores, they were dumping merchandise and I saw the \\"Inferno\\" cd amongst a bin of cd's selling for $3.99. Well, it turns out I was missing my Motorhead more than I ever knew. This cd blew me away on first listen and made me glad to have Lemmy and co. back in my life again.  Every song on this cd is a true gem. Yes, I said EVERY FREAKIN' SONG! I still listen to this cd a lot and it's 2013! Needless to say, that was the best $3.99 I ever spent!<br /><br />If you want true rock and roll, if you want to know what rock and roll is all about, if you want to listen to rock and roll music that kicks you in the nuts (or coochie if you're a chick) and burns into your very soul then you must buy this cd. You will be blown away by the power of the real rock and roll that is cram packed into what I consider to be Motorhead's most excellent album ever - \\"Inferno\\"
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Reviews must contain at least 20 words about the product. Hmmm . . . Well it's a just a clock. But it does what the description says and it's easy to use. Highly recommend. (Long enough?)
1933492953|5.0|Holy cow, I wish I picked this book up a long lonnnng time ago. Well worth the money, lots of information. I never write reviews. Had to write one for this book.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I saw this girl perform on tv and decided to buy this cd. She sounds great. Nice music to have on background while sipping on wine.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Michael Connelly is a great read! Harry Bosch is the best and his (Connelly's) short stories with other characters are a great way into the writing of Mr. Connelly!
B00973902K|5.0|One more song for my kids music collection. When you need a moment of peace just play this song and let the kids loose.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I have ordered 2 cables for my kindle and neither one fit.  There is obviously a difference between a kindle fire, and a kindle fire hd.<br />While both cables were advertised to fit the fire, neither one did.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Fun and challenging and spans all(almost) age groups. relaxing yet exciting great version of this classic game. Love  to play it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|While somewhat predictable, enjoyable reading..I waited then saw the movie and struck by how closely the story and film were...not too much extraneous artistic license taken..not just a &#34;chick flick&#34; but suspenseful and kept the interest going...
B004UID2LC|5.0|This make watching an absoulute delight...makes it increadibly simple and convient. Even a 4  year old uses it :) GREAT
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|I thought it was well done loved Anthony Hopkins as Alfred Hitchcock he was almost spot on. The story line was very good kept my interest can't really say much more. The shipping of the item arrived as advertised and well protected. So I highly recommend this for anyone who wants this blu-ray.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game for everyone. My 4 year old grandson and his uncle (well past 21) have so much fun. This is NEVER boreing, just fun. It is good for family and friends.
B009KEN87O|4.0|This game is an unabashed clone of Galaga... and that is okay. The controls are simple and intuative. The game boots quickly (which is a big plus for me) and it provides a few minutes of mindless gamimg while I wait for an appointment or am just sitting on the john. Great for free. Good for $2.59 if you want something to while away a few minutes.
1442419814|4.0|I love the dystopian novel genre. I have been drinking them in, and this series was next on my list.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and I couldn't put it down! It was a new concept to me, to have ugly people turned into pretty people at a certain age. The main character of the story, Tally Youngblood, initially wants to be pretty. She dreams about when she can turn 16 and move to New Pretty Town. But she meets a new friend and ends up in a new area outside of the city limits that changes her perceptions. The story kept me enthralled the entire time and I kept wanting to see what would happen next.<br /><br />I was also happy that the author provided some insight into why the world ended up the way it was and some of what was going on outside of the city. I really enjoy novels that give me the background on why the world has changed so much from the way it was before.<br /><br />It was a great book and I am glad I decided to pick this up. So far I've read the first two novels, I can't wait for book 3!
B00008NRLX|5.0|Pretty much one of those perfect little albums, although, sometimes I can see almost too much of an American Beauty influence. It doesn't matter. They make it their own and it shines brightly. I think this is my favorite album of theirs. Still remember them playing a few songs on a day it decided to rain at a MN outdoor festival. A fine band and this is one of their best in my opinion. The reprise of 'Stumbling' is very much appreciated and the tone of the album is consistent, folky, and very much like American Beauty from the Dead.
B00846REIS|3.0|Since I am an older person and have some difficulties in certain areas the book has encouraged me keep an open mine to all things possible.
B000001ELP|5.0|I discovered this (forgotten?) album in 2011. A sample listening gave me pause to reflect, &#34;This sounds diifferent....polished, melodic.&#34; I saw that Bob Ezrin, the producer behind KISS' huge selling LP, &#34;Destroyer&#34;, was also the producer of &#34;Elder&#34;. Reading up on the story of the making of &#34;Elder&#34; and how the group seemed to want to immediately disown the whole album, I was expecting a poor effort from the guys. I was pleasantly surprised, however, upon buying the CD from Amazon and playing it a few dozen times. ( For a good summation of the background story and recording I recommend the Wikipedia entry on &#34;Music From the Elder&#34; )<br /><br />To begin, we hear the Fanfare, an Elizabethan woodwind jingle leading to a big brass pronouncement. One's first thought: This is KISS??? The Fanfare fades to the chants of monks (in some mysterious monastery perhaps?)  We are on a journey, the opening proclaims, if not through the tale of a boy seeking, then at minimum we're musically where no KISS record has gone before.<br /><br />The next cut seamlessly begins after the Fanfare.  It is a catchy tune by Paul Stanley, &#34;Just A Boy&#34;. It evokes an English sea chanty and Paul sings it superbly, in a style most un-KISS-like. There's an endearing quality to it: a haunting melody, a build up of  crashing guitars, Paul's falsetto, a great short solo by Ace Frehley- it's all a promising start to the story and the album.<br /><br />&#34;Odyssey&#34;, the next cut, continues the story and is another Stanley effort. Again, his voice strong and clear, he sings with conviction and a willingness to expand his vocal style and range. The track is propelled by a two chord syncopated motif that repeats throughout. Standing out is a mid section vocal harmony duet that quietly tip-toes into another roaring Frehley solo. All along strings, brass, and percussion bring forth a power and majesty, that, along with Stanley's commanding vocals, make this song shine, well, like we've been on an &#34;Odyssey&#34;.<br /><br />The next song, &#34;Only You&#34; is sung by Gene Simmons. It's noted for a harder rock sound, pulsing eighth note guitar licks, an accented guitar chord on the second beat that morphs somehow into the downbeat in the second verse. Anton Figg's drumming here, as on the rest of the album, is exemplary (Lou Reed is another contributor). Simmons' bass and vocal are driving forces of their own leading to.....<br /><br />...The seamless entrance to &#34;Under the Rose&#34;. This is noted for its 6/8 time signature. A kind of slow 2 beat lilt predominates. Again, this is unexpected and gives this KISS album a unique quality. Searing guitar work is juxtaposed with the repeated 1,2,3, arpeggios and Simmons' smooth delivery.<br /><br />Track 6 doesn't live up to the previous 5, however. The vocal by Frehley pales in comparison to that of his mates. The song itself doesn't have any truly unique or original qualities. It's a harsh come down when the album needed to continue its upward momentum. Frehley does some nice work on guitar, though.<br /><br />The next track, Simmons' &#34;A World Without Heroes&#34;, regains some of the lost momentum. His voice, so different from the Demon roar of prior KISS incantations, is a pleasure to hear. Its quiet, plaintive quality works well with the slower, softer backing track.<br /><br />The contemplative mood doesn't last long as &#34;The Oath&#34; begins on track 8. A couple power chords introduce a soaring Stanley vocal. He climbs higher in range on the chorus and handles the chore with aplomb. Guitars drive forward to a swirling keyboard interlude before heading home in the same frenetic pace.<br /><br />&#34;Mr. Blackwell&#34; tells the background of the devilish villain. The track reflects this in the doubling in octaves of Simmons voice. Bass and drum syncopation interplay on the verses sets the stage for a simple 5 note guitar riff on the chorus while Simmons wails.It's all very effective in creating the foreboding needed to portray Blackwell.<br /><br />Track 10 is an instrumental, &#34;Escape From The Island&#34;. Had plans to make a movie or Television show based on the &#34;Elder&#34; seen fruition, this song would contextually make more sense. We don't quite know what Island, where, the circumstances of the boy....it's all a bit hazy. So the song doesn't quite add a whole lot to the musical experience because of this. Still, it's a good piece of guitaring by Frehley, a rollicking romp through the usual rock landscapes.<br /><br />Which brings us to the climax of &#34;I&#34;, an anthem to self determination and belief in oneself. Stanley and Simmons trade lead vocals on the verses. The chorus is a resounding and direct celebration of triumph in the face of doubt, obstacles, and peer pressure. Alas, as the project wasn't as fully developed as conceived we are left to wonder what the deeper implications for &#34;I&#34; might have been.<br /><br />An end tag to the album is the sound of a heavy door opening and closing as we hear a man's steps and a knock on said door. We hear an Elder ask another about the worthiness of the boy. The man says he believes he is worthy. Again, we are guessing as to what this means in the context of the abandoned plans for a more finished project.<br /><br />Overall this album is worthy too. It doesn't belong in the scrap heap of KISSstory. It shows the band stretching into new territory, musically and thematically. The first 5 tracks including &#34;Fanfare&#34; are first rate- the makings of a classic as Stanley and Simmons (and a top notch crew of studio musicians) seem fully invested in the project. Things derail a bit from there sadly, though some of the songs are capable fare by themselves. Producer Bob Ezrin makes the band shine both vocally and instrumentally. The production sounds great. Especially impressive is the drum and bass work. Stings, woodwinds, brass, and keyboards were equally important in defining and making unique this KISS piece. Though some may find their attempt at a concept album derivative and naively sophomoric at best or even hysterically disastrous at worst, KISS and company dared to expand their formula and succeeded in creating interesting music, strong melodies, powerful vocals, and superb production values. If they didn't fully realize their original concept they fulfilled their goal in making something fully original.It's all very effective in creating the foreboding needed to portray Blackwell.<br /><br />Track 10 is an instrumental, &#34;Escape From The Island&#34;.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Loved the book and am looking forward to the 3rd book.  Can't wait till the end of May to read the continnuation of this series.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|It is amazing how four well trained Seals can almost hold off over 150 men. The book told the story of what a Seal must go through to pass and become one of the elite soldiers. These men are not braggart but humble. As an American, I am sorry for the tragedy of Operation Redwing but happy that Marcus Luttrell was a survivor. The American military has an enormous job to keep us free.
B000099T2L|5.0|I love Beyonce! I had lost my cd and I was happy to get this one at a great price. The seller got this dvd to me really fast!
B00BSBXA98|5.0|I have seen most of the Llas Vegas productions and this video is a compilation of the various shows. I was totally engrossed with the movie, it is a must see! A first class movie for the entire family to enjoy and remember. Next time a Cirque du Soleil is in town, treat  yourself and your family to a mesmerizing experience where physical beauty transcends their love of the arts and entertainment.  And if you can't, then watch Worlds Away, it is as if you were there live!
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I absolutely loved this concert live and the dvd is just as great! I watch it over and over again!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|It is on the long side, but in the end it leaves you thinking and wondering how you would have survived such an awful ordeal.  Not knowing if you would survive or not.  I cried and laughed.  I can see why it earned the academy awards it did!  One movie for your library.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I have enjoyed this show from the beginning. Initially I thought it was going to be more for teens not someone pushing 50 like myself. Sure it's a great teen show. Lots of young fashion and a high school setting. But I find it intriguing with the mysterious plot and it keeps me coming back for more each week. Great show!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Addicted to this!  I use it as inspiration to create.  I dabble in crafting, and it's got a lot of pictures to inspire your own creativity.  You create boards that people can use themselves.  It's amazing!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Oh my gosh! Hilarious! These characters get themselves into some pretty sticky situations. The only thing predictable about this book is that they stay together- It is a romance novel after all. :-)
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I downloaded this solely because it was a classic  I watched in childhood.  I  bought the complete set after reading this (At 95¢  how could resist?).  It's very well written and something that I recommend.  Just be aware that It might be scary in parts for the little ones.  i look forward to reading the whole series.  She had silver shoes ...who knew.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|It arrived on time and the songs are just awesome, Twenty one Pilots has a unique style and I love it.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Can you pleeeaasse make 9mm compatible on kindle fire. I really want to buy it! If you can that would be awesome.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I think it's an awesome album and way better than the first one. The cd arrived on time and in excellent conditions.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Can you pleeeaasse make 9mm compatible on kindle fire. I really want to buy it! If you can that would be awesome.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book.  It is an awesome read and very exciting!  Highly recommend.  I could not put it down. Romantic and sexy!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Can you pleeeaasse make 9mm compatible for kindle fire. I really want to buy it! I you can, that would be awesome!
B005D9MUWY|3.0|this works for all my other devices, but causes a forced close on my Optimus. Had to use a backup of version 3
B007TNS6JI|1.0|Can you pleeeaasse make 9mm compatible on kindle fire. I really want to buy it! If you can that would be awesome.
0321885112|5.0|I LOVE this book.  I really learned a lot about Sketchnotes and how to incorporate into my life.  I use this method now when I listen to sermons at church, I use it for journaling and will use it for other seminars/talks in the future.  It is so fun to look through, I never get tired of it.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|Maybe it's because I'm getting older, and maybe the entire series is getting stale for me, but this seventh edition in Greg Heffley's life story seemed like a boring copy of the last book. Of course it isn't, but still. Again: it could be because I'm getting too old to read these books, and if that is the case I encourage younger readers to give it a look.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a really great book to read.  It was hard to put down, and although I sensed how everything would turn out, I still enjoyed the journey through the story.
B001TM14VC|2.0|Too much Hollywood. As usual, it is detached from reality with caricature characters and mediocre acting. Gets boring real fast .
0316789720|4.0|This was a good book to help make really simple drawings.<br />Lots and lots of ideas using very basic shapes.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|I am not going to go over the movie, as those who saw it have their own opinion.  I will comment on the DVD.  No commentary tracks for the movie.  Just the movie itself.  That suggests a rushed version, so they can sell another version later.  The extras, most of which are really a series of blogs, are simply without much effort.<br /><br />Things that could be expanded on about the special effects, like the chase through the goblin caves, were left essentially untouched.<br /><br />One really expects more from a Blu-Ray edition.  You don't get it.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I would highly recommend this to anyone and it arrived quickly in perfect condition.  I am now just waiting for the seventh season to order that also!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is the bomb... It has good plot lines, great characters, unbelievable period settings and is great fun to watch
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Owned it for over a year, its cheap and does its job, good for headphones under 200$ needing that extra volume and bass. I even use it to increase my car's speakers performance/volume daily since my speakers are a little bit underpowered.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Best show ever!  Both Lucy Liu and Jonny Lee Miller have their characters down and are absolutely fantastic.  My new favorite show.
B0095VPAVE|4.0|Runs skyrim on MAX everything at 60 fps, watches 1080P youtubes without fail, only restriction is your internet speed. Its actually extremely fast for the money so stop the hate, if you want godly processing speed for god knows what, spend the 200+ dollars for the I5/I7 and 300+ dollars for the graphics card. so 500$ vs 130$? beat that intel. well its 150 actually, your going to need an aftermarket cooler if you have a cheap motherboard and a cheap case.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|I am just starting to watch this series on the recommendation of a<br />friend and Kindle owner who has similar tastes in these British<br />series as I have.  So far I find it interesting but I must watch more<br />before I really have an opinion.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Couldn't put it down, but such an awful tale, told in such realistically depressing detail.  Can only hope for the authors sake there are not autobiographical elements.  I offer the three stars for the compelling story, but hold two back because I wish I hadn't read it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This was the best of the rest when it came out. I am impressed updates and other changes keep coming out. The only con I have with every AB is when switching phones or Reset or sometimes just an update we lose all our progress. I can only replay the levels so many times that it becomes less fun. I wish Rovio would make a Save Game app for the whole slew of their apps even if only for the Premium or Ad Free AB games I purchased for the phone or tablet.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is easy to understand with regards to the rules/objectives. There were no problems in downloading it, and there's not much more to say on the matter other than it's a good game.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Long time fan and I'm thrilled with this album. More sophisticated sound with great songs. I'm beyond in love with this album. Not sure if I have a favorite track because I love them all. Brought two copies!! One digital download and another from a store to get the bonus songs. Very pleased.
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|Not very well thought out.  To much book. Not much of a mystery. But lexy is somewhat relatable. I like that.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I half believed the reviews on how terrible the kindle version was... I regret it  because I bought the first book to try it out and found out how really bad it can be. It does not go back to where you the last readed page! So I have to write down the position each time!! It really made me miss the real thing:  paper and ink. I am definitely NOT buying the Kindle version for the rest of the collection because the story flows, not complains about that.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can we not have a moment of peace? What will happen next? Who will Rose cause problems for? Will Edith become the focus of the next season?
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I almost didn't read this book because of the negative reviews concerning the content, especially the disappearance of some significant characters.  The author's end note explains it well, the book would be too big if he included every character.  I am taking him at his word, book 4 is laying a foundation for the future and building some new story lines.  Let's see what book 5 does.  Critical comment: So how long until book 6? This story line is going to be hard to remember over an extended period....  I am almost on the verge of giving up all together if this drags on too long.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I am a big fan of twilight and this made my collection complete.the movie arrived on time and I couldn't have been happier.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|It has a great story, and amazing animation.  Love the 80s video game references.  Exceeded all my expectations and then some.
B0095H4FAA|5.0|I am currently reading through this three part trilogy and am enjoying it tremendously! It's such a shame that Steig Larson died because I would have loved to read more about Lisbeth. If you love witty crime this is something you'd love.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This reminds me of the good old atari days. If you liked asteroids that's in here on one of the levels.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|I'm reading through the books and was thrilled that the movie was also very good. They couldn't have chose better actors and even though I adore the Swedish movies this has them beat!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|The quality is so much better than I had expected. I took my time and watched DVD after DVD and loved it!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I absolutely love Jane Austin and Pride and Prejudice has always been my favorite book. This movie was such a wonderful rendition and Keira Knightly did an amazing job as Elizabeth.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I think the game is great. The bad thing is the sensitivity. It is also hard to get really far because you are constantly running out of time. I like how you can go to different places on the island.
B006WQLH7G|2.0|I have tried several security products on my Kindle and found them to take up much space and slow the machines down.
B000002OVJ|5.0|I am a fan of classic rock who often can't resist a live release.  This particular release was irresistable for me because the original release on LP vinyl was not only my favorite live release at that time, it was also one of my most favorite rock albums of all time.  There are some tracks on this album that I am reasonably sure were not included on the vinyl release and the sequence of the tracks was different as well.  But the quality of playing by one of the best ever classic rock British invasion groups is very much intact in this album.  For me My Generation remains the best track on the album.  The stuttered opening by Roger Daltry is priceless while the interplay between Townsend and Entwistle is for me classic rock at its best.  Magic Bus another Who classic done live in the prime of their youth and then burgeoning fame is more icing on this already luscious cake.  Also, Keith Moon's driving beat through out the album is unmistakingly present for the listened.  In my opinion, Keith Moon ranks high with my other two all time favorite rock drummers, Ginger Baker and John Bonham.  Finally, I always enjoy the line, \\"I wanna help you son but you're too young to vote.\\" For me this one of the best rock lyrics of all tme.  That lyric is on the selection \\"A young man ain't got nothin' in world these days\\" track.  Well, the Who, like me, aren't young any more but by now they probably have got all the money they should ever need.  Good for them and good for you if you order this album.  Indeed Rock and Roll is here to stay (thank you, Danny & the Juniors) with considerable help since the British invasion we can also thanks to the Who on this rock classic.
B003DBOS7Y|3.0|Look out, guys! You are in for a looooong evening! But if you can stay awake and make approving sounds at the right times you  might get lucky!
B004I4H8QI|5.0|For me Eric Clapton will always be number two behind the all time great rock guitar virtuoso, Jimi Hendrix.  Also, for me, Cream was Clapton at his best, especially the live Filmore West version of Crossroads found on the Wheels of Fire double album.  But, if you love Clapton as I do then this album is a must for your collection.  This album is rare because it features Clapton and Duane Allman whose great career was cut short by an unfortunate auto accident.  Layla, the title cut stands alone as a clasic song in its own right.  It was the original rendition.  In Clapton album Unplugged you can hear the, of course, unplugged version.  Clapton ruled twice on both of those renditions.  Bell Bottom Blues, Hendrix's Little Wing, Tell the Truth and frankly the whole album just can't, again in my opinion, disappoint the classic rock listener.  So, complete your Clapton collection with Layla, Cream, Clapton Unplugged, The Rainbow Concert , All Things Must Pass (George Harrison's best) Blind Faith and as many of his albums and your budget and space will alow.  Oh, and do some research on just who Layla actually is.  I think you will find it to be very interesting to say the least.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I know it is one of the big hits but, my god, how many times can you shoot birds at something and still be entertained.
B00005214X|5.0|Who knew that while George Harrison was the lead guitarist for the Beatles he had so much outstanding music of his own to bring to the devoted listening fans of the Fab Four.  This album is a testimony to the music talent the George had been writing and collecting during all those years of recording and traveling with the Beatles.  Every song is good to great on this album.  There are no filler tracks.  In addition, there are several rock legends who contributed in some way to this album's remarkable success.  They include, off the top of my head, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, John Lennon, Phil Collins and producer Phil Spector.  This album is now over 40 years old and it still sounds fresh and new to me each time I listen to it.  In my mind, that makes it a masterpiece.
1419705849|5.0|Bought the book as a gift for my 10 year old nephew for Christmas. Book shipped quickly without damage. No problems.
B00000634J|5.0|This comprehensive anthology of John Lennon's body of work following the break up of the Beatles will remind you of how diverse and often times thought provoking and socially challenging John Lennon's music was.  To merely say that he was ahead of his time is, for me, trite.  If you are too young to remember the post Beatle music of John Lennon, in my opinion, this CD captures him at his best.  In fact, post Beatle albums from McCartny, Harrison and Ringo all demonstrate how diverse and musically gifted they all were.  If you would like to hear for yourself what the Beatles created musucally after their break up then this CD is a great place to start.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A different twist for Mr. Grisham, Great story with great ending. Justice is served on a plate with extra trimmings. His character develops extremely well and in a manner that completely surprised me. As usual his story is actually believable. Doesn't take long to read it simply because it is so well written you don't want to stop until you find out what is going to happen.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|If you're thinking about buying this and are reading reviews to determine if it's &#34;any good,&#34; then there's no hope for you.

B0063IH60K|4.0|didn't care for popups but they did eventually go away.<br />very addicting. kept saying just one more game ...definitely recommend.<br />great fun.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|This is a pretty good recording.  I love Bruno Mars' voice, so just hearing it is always great.  Some of the songs are a little strange.  I really like Gorilla, but some of the lyrics make my hairs stand up a little.  Mostly due to the racial undertones.  I'm pretty sure they're unrelated, but I can't help thinking about them when he belts out those lyrics.  Oh well, good listen.  The singles released from it are worth the purchase on their own.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|After the somewhat slow but not as bad as most people think book of a feast for crows I was pleasantly surprised at how engaging this book is.<br />I couldn't hardly put the book down and this book did what none of the other books could do and that was to finally make me care about the story line in essos.(I'll be honest I always got a little board and groaned each time I saw Danny's name on the chapter heading)<br />Now you must keep in mind that these two books are the set up for all the awesomeness that is to come in the final two (possibly three) books of the series and ends right on the verge of what's shaping up to be awesome series defining moments for all three of the main story lines.<br />You can also feel the story starting to speed back up and all the story lines are starting to come together beautifully.<br />I for one love this book and think this series is worth every dime and can't wait to see what happens next. 4/5 stars
B00270WH3Y|5.0|I knew those songs for long, long time and love all of them. Now with Amazon cloud player I can listen them on all my devices.

0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris is hilarious, and occasionally insightful. This book is like reading stand up comedy. This was a book that as soon as I finished reading it, I sent it to a friend. Highly recommend.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|If you have ever watched Doomsday Preppers, Lost, or Twin Peaks then this book is for you. I am always interested in stories of how our civilization will end. How the end comes is a matter of almost limitless options. How we try to put it back together is just as varied.<br />Whether it be utopia or dystopia I guess, would depend on your point of view. The story is original and the characters are well developed. It moves at a very fast pace and kept my nose in the book until I finished.<br />This is the first of many I intend to read by this author.<br />But even better, like any really good book, it keeps you thinking.....<br />Does the end come from war, invasion from outer space, catastrophe in our ability to grow food, failure of our financial systems, natural or un-natural disaster, an epidemic that our medical infrastructure is unable to handle, environmental catastrophe, OR ? Is there really any preparation that we as a species can truly make for any of these events? Would there only be one, or would it be a cascade of catastrophes? Could we really prepare or adapt quick enough to any of these changes?<br />Or does it all end as foretold in Revelations? The reader has to decide for themself. Interesting concept!
0671027344|5.0|This is an important book, and it's a beautifully composed. Perks is eloquently written, shocking and surprisingly deep for a teen novel. I read it as an adult at the direction of a friend and I'm glad I did.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I got as a free game of the day for my kindle.  game is cute and at points challenged me.  not sure if I would of paid for game. only took a few days of casual play to complete.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The beginning of the book is very funny and the book is thought provoking from beginning to end.  Highly recommended.
B002XISFGS|5.0|Yes, it's glacially paced and Shatner's toupee should get its own credit in the movie given that it looks like it was ready to take off from his head at any given moment, but I love this movie. The Director's Cut is a better version overall, but this version is sharper to the eye and the music is still one of the best movie soundtracks you'll ever hear.
B005HI4LLY|2.0|I don't know why this movie got such great reviews.  I think even Leonard Maltin gave it a ***1/2 review!  What's that about?  Sure, the movie was pretty funny, but it's never quite as clever as it wants to be.  Also, the balance of comedy and horror leans too far to the comedy side.  Comedy and horror are incredibly difficult genres to balance together.  Some examples of really good ones I can think of are \\"Return of the Living Dead,\\" \\"Ravenous,\\" and \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\"  These films were all grounded in a sort of violent reality whereas Tucker & Dale requires some major suspension of disbelief if you're going to go along with the horror element.  The idea behind the film is a clever one, I'll definitely give it that.  The leads are very likable and the setting very comfortably familiar (as far as horror movies go).  But, like I said, I felt that the comedy outweighed the horror and that the movie was a little too goofy to warrant a great review.  I guess I'm trying to say that, as a horror fan, I found the movie too cartoonish.  I think that's the word I'm looking for.  Anyway, I've only seen it once and movies like Tucker & Dale tend to come across better for me the second time around, when I know what to expect.  I'll give it another watch on its own merits, and maybe I'll like it more.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|This novel was good right from the start. Has a very interesting ending. It made a long airplane trip very fast.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|If you take out the pornography and repetition what you have left is about twenty pages of dull plot. Yes I am older, but have read hundreds of books with explicit sexual content and enjoyed them, but those books had riveting plots and held my interest. I even purchased the second book hoping there would be some redeeming qualities in it, but nope; same oh, same oh. I will not be reading the third.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I got started reading these because my granddaughter was reading it for her school summer program a couple of years ago before the movie came out. Good.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The cast of Firefly has some of the best chemistry that I have ever seen in a TV series. I think if FOX would have aired the episodes as they were meant to air they would have seen much higher ratings.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This whole series is very good. And I didnt get the impression of sexual content that some critics said was there.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Wow, he still gets me to love characters that end up dead before they do great things, yet I still read on hoping beyond hope they survived. The twist and turns of all the books in the series keep me on my toes and at the edge of my seat. Can't wait for the next book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The same excellent reading as the rest of the series. I would highly recommend it to my friends and older grandchildren.

B00356CO1E|4.0|Just streamed this from Amazon Prime. I have been going to the gym, working out on the elliptical and the treadmill. I have also used Leslie Sansone 4 mile with Boosted walking video. I admit that I am out of shape. However, I have been working out almost daily for a couple of months.  This workout had my teeth chattering, and my legs are still shaking. I am going to keep at it. I did almost 5 miles of cardio the other day and the workout was nowhere near the intensity of this video.
B0068THAGY|3.0|There was a lot of money available to make this movie, and it shows. Over and over and over again, usually in slow motion. If they had tightened it up, it would have been more fun, although it has its moments. The school-kid zombie movie shown during the final credits was fun, and left me with a good memory. But, overall, it seemed like all that money wasn't put to a good enough purpose.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This is more of a story about drug and alcohol abuse than it is about the plane crash.  I thought Denzel Washington did a good job in his portrayal of an alcoholic.  Language a bit colorful, otherwise a good movie

B008Y5OWMK|3.0|[spoilers] This is not a masterpiece, nor is it the worst film ever made. However, some guidance may be necessary. Much of the complaining is about getting lost watching it, having no idea what's going on. A simple piece of advice: pretend it's a European art film, i.e. supposed to be slow, and impossible to understand without subtitles. Subtitles make a *huge* difference. Second, it helps to know something about Marxism, since the narrative is constructed around the idea of class determinism and that even the exploiting class warps its own humanity and cannot achieve fulfillment as long as it exploits. The theme of the film, then, is, the West promised to be a place where people could escape from their class background as exploiter or exploited and find fulfillment, but this was an illusion: ultimately the peasants who sought escape are put down and massacred, and the Harvard man who sought escape fails in his new Western role as lawman and has to go back East and return to his status as bloodless exploiter. Hence the college scene in the beginning and the boat scene in the end. So yes, it does all make sense, ultimately. The characters are Big Abstractions: the woman who tries to escape from the traditional woman's role by becoming a businesswoman (a madam) only to find that patriarchy won't accept this - she's raped and murdered. The immigrant (Christopher Walken) who hopes to be accepted by the ruling class by doing its bidding, only to find, tragically, that he can't find love and freedom that way, and when he tries to have it all, is destroyed by his own contradictions. The man who wants to represent the ideals of Law, only to discover that social conflicts are not *under* Law, but that Law is ultimately just a tool of, you guessed it, the ruling class. The problem with the film is twofold. First, assuming you get the theme, it's pretty heavy-handed, dogmatic, simplistic. Second, the writing is weak: we are led to believe that the characters represent these various types, and that therefore their actions are Important, but they are given far too little to do to demonstrate it. Averill never asserts the claims of Law forcefully enough, and never gets thwarted strikingly enough, to make his transformation at the end from lawman to revolutionary leader plausible or interesting. It's not that Kristofferson's performance is inadequate, it's that he's not given enough to DO. This is true for everyone in the film. There is a plot: the bad ranchers are going to kill to the good rustlers, the rustlers will fight back, but they will fail. But all the movement is just people (and thus the audience) waiting for this to happen, for the most part. More subplots, with more choices leading to more situations, etc. etc. woven into that main action, was what was needed. In short, a writer other than the director (this seems to be a mistake great directors are prone to, trying to do their own writing: witness Coppola's recent promiing-but-flawed work). Also: Reluctantly, I concede that the claims about the cinematography are fair: the sepia tone in the original was excessive. This, however, has been corrected in the Criterion version, and with all the brown wiped away, the imagery *is* stunning. So: watch the Criterion version, think Marxism, use subtitles, split it into two evenings, and enjoy the stunning imagery. It's not going to be a perfect film, but it's one of the important American auteur films of (made in) the late 70s, like the Godfathers, Apocalypse Now, Chinatown, and is worth a look. I understand the temptation some feel to praise it to the skies to make up for the grotesquely unfair negative reviews it's received, but while this was an attempt to equal those just mentioned films, it never really lives up to its promise. Would that every overreaching, flawed film were so magnificent in conception and so gorgeous in execution.<br /><br />Postscript: my experience with watching with subtitles was not with the Criterion Collection restored version (which is still the preferred way to watch). The Criterion Collection version has no subtitles, which is quite maddening. I found that the only way I could really enjoy the film fully, especially during the early train station sequence where all the dialogue is inaudible, was by having a screenplay open to serve as my substitute for subtitles. A serious shortcoming and possibly a deal-breaker for some. This reflects a larger policy problem at Criterion (no subtitles for English language films) which they would do well to reconsider. The decision to include no subtitles is not only a disservice to the hearing impaired, but there are snippets of dialogue in various languages (Czech, Polish, German, etc. because of the immigrant dimension) and there's no way to know what these folks are saying either.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|if you've often wondered the &#34;whys&#34; of what drives you to avoid the spotlight this is the book for you.  as a (closet) introvert forced into public speaking reading this has given me insight and sanity.  a must read for those of us who live two lives. I can't express my gratitude and thanks to the author. I have recommended this to siblings as well as human resource professionals.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|I am a big fan of this series. The more details the better. I love their twisted loved story. Must read.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|The backgrounds are lovely. The story is wrong! (minus one star)<br />It is challenging to get 3stars on every level without using hammers or bombs to break tiles . You have to be good at swaping because some levels there are walls the pieces land on and the hammers and bombs don't affect the pieces.A bit confused how some pieces will fall off the board and some stay on the shelf but fun to play. I had the free version and was really glad to get this as free app of the day.  I like the globe you can spin.
B00BF11STU|2.0|Too slow too long but educational. We were really looking forward to it coming out. Anticipating for it to be a hit..Needless to say we were diappointed.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game, but I am having problems with getting passed the rock, I thought I was following everything right but I am stuck. I don't want to remove the game from kindle. It is an awesome game and I like hidden objects. Can someone help me.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Ben Affleck stars in and directs the adaptation to Prince of theivies, the Town. Affleck plays Doug Macray, a CharlesTown bank and armored car robber who after a semi-botched bank robbery takes a female bank manager hostage, and then investigates her. He eventually falls in love with her, and sees her as a way for him to leave his life of crime behind. But the FBI wants Doug and his crew and things escalate when their approached with a job from the neighborhood crime boss the florist to hit Boston's Fenway Park, a score that would set them for life and make them legends. The scene that gets to you is when Doug faces his best freinds sister and his former lover Krista, who wants Doug to be a surrogate father for her daughter Shyne a drug baby. Doug refuses to allow Krista to come with him, and even says out of everyone he can think of he should take Shyne away from her and take her with him. Krista gets in a car accident, and desperate to keep custody of Shyne she makes a deal with the FBI, in exchange for them not taking her daughter she tells them about the heist planned.

Clare upon discovering the money and Doug's letter, she donates some money to the local rec center and with the rest waits to follow him to where he now lives. A good movie for crime lovers.
B009KEN87O|4.0|This is like playing a updated version of space invaders. It is<br />2D part of the way and switches to 3d at times. Overall it's cool.

B009YP9L7U|3.0|A few of my blogger peep's recommended Waking Up Married and since I adore tales about marriages of convenience I grabbed a copy. This was delightful, and the romance despite the \\"I Do's\\" developed slowly and felt genuine. Both characters are successful and independent but when it comes to relationships and commitments they are both carrying a lot of emotional baggage. Conner is a planner, and he wants a family, without all the mess and emotional attachments love brings. This made him go from perfect to the ice man. I really enjoyed his struggle. Then we have Megan, who doesn't make it past the six month mark in any relationship, and has serious abandonment issues. I loved their banter and watching the two of them discover something more. This was well paced and made me smile. originally posted at caffeinatedbookreviewer dot com.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book is really sweet. The storyline is unconventional and doesn't seem like it would work but luckily it does.

0670026638|4.0|If you were to ask a Japanese person who is neither a bird lover nor an ornithologist, he or she would probably tell you that the Jungle Crow is a nuisance. As a character explains in A TALE FOR THE TIME BEING, Ruth Ozeki's new novel, these crows rip open garbage bags, eat kittens and use coat hangers to make nests on utility poles, which causes power outages. According to Japanese mythology, however, the Jungle Crow is a messenger of the gods. The inevitable clash of myth and reality is one of the themes of this novel, a challenging work that combines folklore, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, and, of all things, quantum physics and the paradox of Schrödinger's cat.<br /><br />In the present day, a novelist named Ruth, who, like Ruth Ozeki, lives in British Columbia, discovers a plastic bag on the beach. The bag contains a Hello Kitty lunchbox with three items inside: a stack of handwritten letters, an antique wristwatch, and a diary, a \\"pudgy bound book with a faded red cover.\\" The handwriting in the diary is in purple gel ink --- the handwriting, Ruth assumes correctly, of a young girl.<br /><br />Nao, the young girl, is 16 when she writes the diary in 2001. On the first page, she tells us that we are reading \\"the diary of my last days on earth.\\" Nao grew up in Sunnyvale, California, but when her father gets laid off from his job as a games developer during the dot-com era, she moves to Japan with her family. The transition to Japanese life is difficult. Classmates make fun of her. She is the target of an especially cruel form of ijime (bullying), with classmates jabbing and punching her so hard that the attacks leave cuts and bruises all over her body.<br /><br />When Nao's jobless father isn't feeding crows in the park, he resorts to off-track betting in a failed attempt to make money. Instead, he loses the family's finances and tries to kill himself by jumping in front of a train. While her father recuperates, Nao is sent for the summer to the templewhere Jiko, her 104-year-old great-grandmother, lives. The original plan is to chronicle Jiko's life in her journal, but instead Nao writes mostly about school and family struggles and her desire to commit suicide.<br /><br />Ruth is fascinated by Nao's diary. A former New Yorker now living with her eco-artist husband, Oliver, on an island in Desolation Sound, Ruth is having trouble writing a memoir. She and Oliver wonder how the diary wound up on the shores of British Columbia. They suspect that the 2011 tsunami brought it across the Pacific. Ruth becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to Nao and her family. As she conducts her investigations, she and Oliver notice the sudden appearances of a Jungle Crow they hadn't seen before. Muriel, an anthropologist friend, speculates that this could be a Grandmother Crow --- a magical ancestor that can shape-shift and assume animal or human form. Ruth dismisses the suggestion, yet the crow becomes a more frequent presence as Ruth makes inquiries into Nao's life.<br /><br />At times, particularly in the first half of the book, A TALE FOR THE TIME BEING could have benefited from more editing. Simple activities that could be described in a few words go on for a paragraph or more. One wonders if Ozeki and her editor rushed to get the novel out in time for the second anniversary of the March 11, 2011 tsunami. And Ozeki occasionally strains for profundity, as when Oliver introduces the paradox of Schrödinger's cat to explain the confluence of worlds and the quantum theory that everything that's possible will one day happen.<br /><br />But Ozeki deserves praise for tackling subjects few novelists ever would have broached. A 750-word review can't do justice to the many big ideas and lovely moments in this book. There's a beautiful scene in which Nao and her father watch the footage of the September 11th attacks. Later, in a harrowing episode at school, Nao is the victim of a prank that Ozeki describes in exquisite, if painful, detail. The conversations between Nao and Jiko are smart and moving. In an era when American novels rarely have the courage to address large themes, it's a pleasure to read a book that dares to think big.<br /><br />Reviewed by Michael Magras
B008476HBM|5.0|I was re-reading this book for a book club discussion.  The Kindle version worked fine, and I found it easier than going to the library to borrow the book.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The game moves slowly on my kindle fire but is fun. I wish it were longer before requiring a purchase though.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I didn't not watch the movie of know how it ended. I had no idea of the backstory to their relationship so the book made me want to read on!<br /><br />It was a good book, but I did expect more to the story of Nikki. Just built it up a lot and didn't take much time talking about what happened and what the result was.<br /><br />Don't want to spoil
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Excelente producto muy bueno muy interesante si se me dañara el mio lo volveria a comprar por lo comodo que es.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book is full of switcheroos thanks to the changing perspectives and time shifts.  Your sympathies will shift as you read the story.  It was a well crafted story, but I found the characters unlikable in the end.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Great story that is very interesting to read!  You definitely get a good sense of what the experience really would be like.  I was always ready to pick the book up and read more.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|The movie had a good combination of twists and turns, but it wasn't like you had to stay on your toes to follow it.  Overall it's a good entertaining movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this was an awesome book, I can not wait for the next one in the series! It makes a memorable book
B0011Z8Q90|5.0|I don't know why anyone wouldn't give this debut album from the early 70's anything other than 5 stars.  Although I'm not a fan of the current Eagles, and certainly their personalities can be called into question, this is still one hell of a collection of songs.
B000UJCALI|5.0|i bought this movie because i wanted to see what friend talk about it and i loved it and i loved it
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It's a solid game, but after not very long at all it all starts to feel the same.  It'd help if the starting sections of track weren't usually the same race after race.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I installed the free version a week ago and have been extremely happy with it.  I felt I needed to show my support to the developer so I decided to purchase the pro version.  Like others have said here, the free version is great and the ads aren't intrusive; however, when a developer puts out a strong, reliable product for free the least one can do is show support by purchasing the full version.  Especially considering how inexpensive the pro version is.  I definitely feel as though I'm getting a bargain because I purchase the app through Amazon`s app store and I get to use it on my phone and my Kindle Fire HD!  I strongly suggest you try the free version for a week. You'll be sold!!!  Then do the right thing and support this amazing developer and purchase the pro version.
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|I got this mainly because my son is enamored with &#34;Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)&#34; and wanted to show him how different Annie Lennox could sound while still remaining so utterly identifiable.

030746363X|5.0|I just did my week 7 measurements yesterday,  I have lost 25.4 lbs and 28.25 inches.  It has really changed my life.  I hurt my back 5 years ago and exercise is hard, I can walk etc but I tried the Brazilian Butt Lift, Insanity and P90X and couldn't do any of them.  They all caused pain.  I tried another diet before this one and gained 7lbs.  I haven't even stuck to the diet as good as I could have been.  There were a few weeks in the beginning where I cheated more than just my cheat day.  Look at the results, and after only 7 weeks.  I am hooked!
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|This very unsual story of a &#34;spiritual&#34; leader of &#34;The Cause&#34; with an unusual philosophy that leans toward the definition of a cult.  All the majors do a fine job fleshing out their characters ... especially given the difficult material.  Joaquin Phoenix shows he still has chops and plays his disturbed war veteran character well.  Not everyone will like this movie ...
B009HUB40Y|4.0|love this game...great way to pass the time. could play these kinds of games all day. just don't like limited lives
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a good app lots of fun. It is very addicting, i just stopped so that i can post a review :-)

B005Q1W10A|5.0|We loved this season and were sad when we finished it! Can't wait for the new season, we have watched the first three.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|For the price the audio quality is pretty good, but the omni-directional pickup pattern was a little shallow.  The mic has to be placed just right, otherwise a subject who turns their head too far will drop off noticeably in the signal.<br /><br />The battery helps the audio quality, but the on/off switch seems too easy to accidentally turn off or on.  I use a piece of tape  to secure it in place.<br /><br />And the cord is WAY TOO LONG.  I understand it is meant for a person who might have to travel far to plug it into their camera, but it should have a separate extension cord instead of being all long, all the time.

1933492953|4.0|You'd do just as well pausing and drawing every shot in your favorite movies. There are some great chapters about what makes these shots so effective. But you can figure it out on your own. It's mostly self explanatory.<br /><br />This is for hollywood storyboard artists. There is a little about comics, but not enough to cover it in the appropriate detail.<br /><br />Another thing is don't expect to close the book knowing how to draw like this dude. Nothing about drawing technique is covered. Nothing about balancing creativity and reference for creating content.<br /><br />On the other hand the amazing quality of what he is teaching makes this worth while.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I have a lot of free time at school and can rarely find a good game to play. I found this on the app of the day for free and I love it. Better than space invaders.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is a lot more fun than the screenshots make it look! Do yourself a favor and download it! The reviews aren't wrong.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I have enjoyed most of Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus books.<br /><br />However, this one had two major problems.<br /><br />One, too many main characters.  It was hard to keep up with who was doing what, and it seemed in an attempt to try to keep the story line clear there were always several characters milling around doing nothing.  No specific storyline could get fleshed out as much as I would have liked because all of the characters needed time devoted to them.<br /><br />Two, this books position in the series made it drag.  We can tell that we are getting close to the climax for the series and are ramping up for the big fight at the end.  However, that is all we did in this book.  This book lacked a good strong storyline of it's own and read like it was just a really long trailer for the next book to come.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|At times &#34;The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry&#34; moved strongly forward, and at times it seemed to fold back on itself and stall.<br /><br />Two people, beyond middle aged, whose lives seem almost beyond recovery, with little left to be surprised by, and whose lives had become neutral, not bad, not good, just almost nonexistent, and how one tiny little step leads to another and another until life has become altogether different, and that bland, harmless place of existence can no longer satisfy.<br /><br />For me a sad story of waste, and smallness, that gives rise to hope.  I'm not certain that there is enough substance here for a strong recommend.
B008GJVH7M|5.0|&#34;Millers Crossing&#34; is, in my opinion still one of the best gangster movies ever made.  I consider it in league with Godfather I and II.  Goodfellas, and Mean Streets.<br />It is complex and beautifully shot story, chalk full of Cohen Bros quirkiness and luscious cinematography.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to anyone
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written and gripping story. The first half I thought one way and the second half I thought another. It takes a talented writer to do that. It's a thrilling story, read it!
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I use this when I'm travelling &amp; so far its been great. I'm leaving tomorrow for China for a longer trip so that will be my big test. I'm confident it will work
B00005ATQF|5.0|This is a excellent film, but hard to watch at times.  This film is really about the men, not the war.  It starts with basic training and the military tactic of taking these naive young men to the breaking point and for one recruit, beyond it. I was reading Rumor of War at the same time and both the film and the book tell the same story.  Basic training is hell, but doesn't really prepare you for being in real war action.  War is chaos and sometimes no one is in charge.  These young soldiers have to deal with a sniper, who they cannot find, who is  killing them as they try to handle their first look at death; deal with the idiocy of command telling them they are not under fire and refusing support; and then making a decision of conscious that will in many ways affect who they are as life goes on. It reminds those of us who did not serve, that the young men and women who served on the front lines (not in offices in the states) are the real heroes and the Vietnam Vets deserved better than what they received when they came home.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|A great continuation of the lives of these geeks! Highly recommend getting the whole series, well worth the money spent.

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I read this book in about 24 hours, couldn't put it down. It's a fast read and captivating from the start. However, I became fairly annoyed with it about 2/3 of the way through. The dynamics between Travis and Abby get a bit stale and overplayed. I admit I do look forward to Walking Disaster and will likely devour it as fast as this one though.

Yes after being married 43 years, and both of us wondering if we will make 44, on April the 8th.  Times like watching this movie, we know we will, but then there's the times I watch the movie he picks out, a lot of murder, action, ( like the bad news we hear nightly, and he falls asleep snoring.  We rented it so I keep watching. LOL LOL  I suggest this movie to all.

B00BHU9DUK|2.0|The plot is hard to follow, because the whole movie takes place on a theater stage. It is not just a movie, it jumps around from scene to scene, and all the stage hands are visible as they walk around. Very poorly directed. Boring and hard to follow.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I have no idea what people can see in this book.  I could not get through it.  There are things in life that you just don't need to have a happy time and great relationship.  This book is one of the things that I don't need.

B007I8S1TY|5.0|It's well-written, and told me what I needed to know to help a customer.  Specifically, the customer wanted to know how to optimize MySQL databases for performance, and the book did have some good tips for that.<br /><br />Although, I must add, that the tip that did my customer the most good wasn't listed in the book.  Rather, I found the procedure for placing databases on separate drives by doing a Google search.  But still, all-in-all, a useful book.

817224164X|3.0|After reading many books about WWII I decided I'd go to the source (horses mouth--or ass?) in an attempt to futher my understanding of how Nazi Germany came to be. I can not say I enjoyed reading this seemingly endless rant, but it did enlighten me as to the insanity of Hitler's message. Although he never presented any logic or examples of why he thought the way he did, he certainly made his prejudices clear. But that was true of most of what Hitler had to say. Many words but not much evidence to support his theories.<br /><br />I'd have to say that this was one of the most difficult books I've ever struggled to get through. The negativity and hatred made it very unpleasant, especially knowing exactly what it was all leading up to. What a sad comment on Germany--and the rest of the world for that matter-- that an insane man could make his evil intentions so clear and yet nobody bothered to stop him before it was too late. At least for many millions of his stated enemies.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|It's been seven years too long since Justin Timberlake graced us with his voice.  Leaving the world of music with the benchmark album `Future Sex/Love Sounds' and then hitting up the big screen in films like `Alpha Dog' and `The Social Network', Timberlake seemed to be in a different stage of his career and part of me feared that he was never going to return to the place where he belongs.  Say what you will about his acting (spotty at best), Timberlake's voice is like gold and his stylistic approach to music is nearly unmatched.<br /><br />Almost immediately after the release of `The 20/20 Experience', comparisons to `Future Sex/Love Sounds' were brought on and people were simply dismissing `The 20/20 Experience' as a secondary venture.  I take issue with this.  `The 20/20 Experience' is NOT `Future Sex/Love Sounds', and any true fan of Timberlake wouldn't want it to be.  Artists need to grow and mold their sound and present us with new things in order to sustain their reputation as true talents of their craft.  Timberlake does that in spades all over these ten tracks; each dripping with experimental style that glistens and draws the listener in.<br /><br />This is a beautifully cohesive album that works brilliantly as a collective piece, and maybe less so as individual songs.  Yes, listening to songs in solidarity and not in the context of the entire album may cause a different reaction from the listeners, but dedicating and hour+ to actually ingesting the album as a whole you may have a different feel.<br /><br />As my title suggests, you need to let this album marinade in order to appreciate the magic of it all.<br /><br />The first single from the album is easily a plow at introducing a more polished sound with spice and the allure of Jay-Z (as if Timberlake wasn't draw enough).  It works the more you listen to it, despite the fact that my initial listen was underwhelming.  The beauty of this album is that it works so wonderfully together that even the flaws begin to shine thanks to the complete feeling they add to the album itself.  I actually would love this song if Jay-Z's part were cut.  It is just stupid and adds nothing to the track.  The lyrics are simple and meaningless and kind of silly, which takes away from the feeling of smoothness.  The second single is the infinitely better `Mirrors'.  I say infinitely, which may be a bit of a stretch, since `Suit & Tie' is NOT a bad song, but `Mirrors' just feels like vintage Timberlake with a kick.  The beat is reflective of something off of `Future Sex/Love Sounds' but the progression and killer chorus help lift this track into something new and fresh.  The lyrical meaning is sincere and it is beautifully composed.  I love how the beat of the track doesn't change much from verse to chorus and so on, but Justin uses his voice as an instrument, changing the key in his voice to add color to each segment of the song.<br /><br />After that, the album is a steaming pot of diverse and experimental connected by an old-school vibe that is produced to the gills and delivers a clean, modern and sophisticated sound.<br /><br />Club heavy offerings like `Don't Hold the Wall' (probably the sickest track on the album) and `Tunnel Vision' are made to keep Timberlake relevant to a generation obsessed with getting nasty on the dance floor, and Timberland's slick beats and development of sound are a perfect match for Timberlake's undeniable sex appeal and slinky seductive pull.  `Let the Groove Get It' is a tad too repetitive and chaotic for my liking, like a big band take on a club track with redundant chanting on the chorus, but others seem to love it to death and it does have a bouncy atmosphere that makes you want to move.  `Pusher Love Girl' opens the album and is probably the perfect representation of the approach Timberlake took here.  It is smooth as all get out and feels very classic in construction.  The `after song' carries a lot of weight here because it progresses the sound andshows the more advanced side of the album, the progressive movement of sound.<br /><br />I'll just stop here and say that I have never had a problem with length if it served a purpose, and the extended length of these tracks certainly serves a purpose, as they did on `Future Sex/Love Sounds'.  Consider the song itself foreplay and the `after song' the moment when Timberlake brings it all home.<br /><br />The dirty pop of `Strawberry Bubblegum' and the soul band beauty of `That Girl' mark significant moments on the album where Timberlake adds depth and color to his vision.  `Strawberry Bubblegum' especially works on so many levels, from the cheeky lyrics to the fun musicality to the pitch perfect vocal delivery.  It just pops (pun intended).  `Spaceship Coupe' is also a beautifully composed track.  My only complaint is the use of alien terminology on the track.  I'm just tired of the tired use of space/aliens in music these days.  It just feels corny now.<br /><br />And that leaves me with the grand opus of `Blue Ocean Floor'; the albums magical closing.  I don't know if I have words for how incredible this song is, for so many reasons.  First and foremost, the song is so earnest and `felt'.  The song is also completely removed from all signs on Timberlake, void of the charisma and charm and completely drenched in this newfound depth.  The chorus is something magical, with the perfect combination of sound and emotion.  It is an experimental sound that actually reminds me a lot of Team Sleep, Chino Moreno's (lead singer of the Deftones) side project from the early aughts.  The musicality isn't steeped so much in actual `music' but more composition of sound and it almost has a very wet sound, as if it were actually comprised of sounds found on the ocean floor.  Very futuristic and progressive and serves as a new benchmark for Timberlake to now surpass.<br /><br />So, that completes my thoughts on the album.  I'm in awe of it as a collective piece, of which it works rather gloriously.  In parts, I can see flaws (especially on `Let the Groove Get In' and `Spaceship Coupe') but in the context of the album they serve purpose and feel connective and integral.  NOTHING here feels like filler, which is so important with an album this trimmed down.<br /><br />And joy to the world that Timberlake is releasing a second half to this album (to complete 20 tracks) later this year.<br /><br />Personal ranking:<br />1) Blue Ocean Floor<br />2) Don't Hold the Wall<br />3) Strawberry Bubblegum<br />4) Mirrors<br />5) Tunnel Vision<br />6) Pusher Love Girl<br />7) That Girl<br />8) Suit & Tie<br />9) Spaceship Coupe<br />10) Let the Groove Get Inshows the more advanced side of the album, the progressive movement of sound.<br /><br />I'll just stop here and say that I have never had a problem with length if it served a purpose, and the extended length of these tracks certainly serves a purpose, as they did on `Future Sex/Love Sounds'.

1596680296|5.0|I have been looking for a how to book for socks for a while. I've watched youtube videos and downloaded free patterns, but when I checked this one out of the public library, I knew this was exactly what I needed.

I bought a hardbound rather than a Kindle copy to make it easier to refer to while knitting.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|CANT GET ENOUGH! i watched season 1-3 on prime instant video.  so in need of this sick and disturbing series that i purchased to catch up.  had to fast forward a few time a little freaked out.  its amazing that one can become numb to the gore.  its an intense show that needs to be tolerated in order to get though it....but well worth it!

B000LN7HUC|4.0|I tested it with regular  ethyl alcohol.<br /><br />I took off the cap and flame regulator and started the fire with a match.<br /><br />The flame takes a few minutes to reach its peak, which is basically when the alcohol starts boiling and producing pressure over the alcohol vapor, resulting on a bigger flame.<br /><br />After attaining full flame, I put a liter of water over the fire , in less than 10 min. boiled.<br /><br />Then I tried to fry an egg, in less than  5 min it was done.<br /><br />Then some meat with fatty parts. I cooked well and fast, the meat's fat exuded quickly and even catched fire for brief moments from the stove's flame.<br /><br />The full flame is strong. Don't underestimate it because is alcohol. When I fried the egg I burned it a little before turning it upside down to cock it well on both sides.<br /><br />I carbonized some of the meat for not paying attention.<br /><br />The included flame regulator is great for turning it off when you are boiling water or cooking something that is fast to get done, because you just cover the stove and is done.<br /><br />But if you are cooking things like rice, beans and other slow meals. You need a smaller flame to boil the water for a longer time to hydrate the food, break down carbohydrates, etc. And the flame regulator has to be opened to some \\"try and see\\" aperture. Only experience will teach you the right aperture.<br /><br />But that is not the problem, the problem comes when you are cooking at a low flame with the regulator on top of the stove, and your meal is done. How to put down the fire ? The regulator is hot and you can't touch it. If you take it out with the handle/pliers you need some water to cool it down, close it and put it over the fire, which is not practical on the wilderness.<br /><br />Fortunately I discovered that if the regulator is not to open you can blow it off like a candle. But this method is not perfect. The hot stove will still vaporize your alcohol quickly. The rubberO-ring on the cap forbids using it over the hot stove. Only solution a found for the moment is using other metal disc over it until it cools down. You still loose some alcohol due to the hot stove, but is less. Measuring the strictly needed amounts helps to palliate the problem, but is a hassle. Of course in a cold winter this is not much of a problem, I did not test it in cold conditions so I can't speak for its performance on cold weather.<br /><br />Other minor gripe is the regulator's disc paint is easy to scratch when using the handle/pliers. An integrated handle would be good for putting down the flame. I way to adjust the flame while the regulator is on top of the stove would be great.<br /><br />Overall, this is very good and complete product. It has its quirks which must be learned through experience. It's light, simple and can cook a wide variety of food. Only the already described quirks take a star from it.

B008JF8O9M|3.0|I choose this APP for my Kindle because I thought it would work for my application to print emails and other info from the WEB.<br />This APP would not work on my PRINTER. We have a HP WIRELESS Printer. Model did not show up under printer types. I tried to print to my  I.P. address  and HPEPRINT but would not print. This APP might work for some other printer. This is why my STAR rating was a 3. This might work with a number but not ours Thanks.

B005FPT51K|1.0|We got the ibaby monitor despite its bad reviews and truly regret our decision! My husband and I are both engineers so we are quite technical and computer saavy.  We thought that others who had difficulty with the monitor maybe were just not very computer saavy, but we were wrong.<br />The monitor is difficult to get set up on your wireless network. The app is quite klunky and frequently locks up (we use it on iPad 3,iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S).  It is difficult to toggle between cameras (we have two), and the overall functionality is poor.<br />We actually disconnected our monitors and bought a cheap digital monitor that works much better.<br />My advice is to save your money and don't buy this monitor! It's not worth the money! Don't let the name fool you. This us NOT an Apple product and you can tell!

B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a nice little strategy game. Build up your village, and gather resources, whilst training elite troops to protect your land, and take on virtual intruders. Get your Facebook mates to build their own village, and then laugh with them as you annihilate them. Main drawback is the usual need, built into all of these games, and that is the need to purchase \\"extras\\" to help speed the game, and your progress along. The graphics are neat. I like watching the woodcutter, and the farm going about their business, but, as one with few Facebook friends, why does one have to pay for being mate less. It just adds insult to injury. Why can't loners enjoy these games without having to pay for being friendless.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is an amazing story that everyone should read.  I had no idea of the brutality of the Kim family regime.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love my Verso Prologue Kindle cover.  It makes the Kindle look so much like a &#34;regular&#34; book that, when we were robbed a few months ago, it was in plain sight, right in front of a 15&#34; TV that was taken, but the thieves left it alone.  I bought it for the richness of it's looks, but it works well when I'm using my Kindle, too.

B000FCK65W|5.0|This is a classic. I'm sure everyone that reads this book will come away with a stronger feeling of family no matter where they were born. I had forgotten about 'the junkie'. In this day and age, most will think of an addict but growing up it was the 'scrap guy' that took your bottles and cans and gave you pennies for them. I'm glad I re-read this book.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a terrific step-by-step way to format and prep my book for self publishing.  My research part is completed and now its time to write this book that is trying to leap out of my chest.  I'm setting up Microsoft Word so that I can convert it to Kindle's format with a click of a button.  Nice! I like the ease of setting everything the way it needs to be for publishing.  Not only is each step described, so that I can understand it, but there are ;pictures.  Makes it even easier.<br />Don't worry Mr. LaBean (my diabolitical character) you'll soon be unleashing your terror upon the unsuspecting...

B0060MYM3S|5.0|The HBO series inspired me to read the books (all 6000 pages so far).  Good story, Great Characters.  If only we didn't have to wait another decade to get to the end.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The first book, Beautiful Creatures, was so good I'm now reading the second in the series.  Beautiful Darkness is every bit as good as the first book. Will definitely read the series and hope more is to come from these writers.
0071762345|4.0|You could call this a guidebook on how to make your brand likeable with social media.<br /><br />I would use this as a reference for current and future social medias. The book presents case studies of real life situations and how a person can help a business improve its digital identity. It's very easy to read and understand, the author presents the material for new and current business people engaged in the social media world. It helps you set up your social media campaigns to a path to success.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to people who are starting to use social media in their business or people who want to become digital marketers. Even though it focuses on existing brands. It doesn't mean that you can't use the strategies and techniques the books present to your advantage.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|I've seen this movie about three times now and I enjoye it everytime I watch it!! Definitely one of the BEST movies I watched in 2012. Jennifer Lawrence was beyond amazing and she truly truly deserved that Oscar and I was beyond happy when she won. Bradley Cooper was so amazing as well and really played the part of Pat perfectly.<br /><br />The movie was so real and endearing. The movie is probably something that many people can relate to and it really handled the topic of bipolar disorder with a lot of dignity. At the same time there was just the right amount of humor put into the movies at the right times. The chemistry between Jennifer and Bradley was undeniable and they worked so well with each other. Cant wait to see the other two movies with them in it.<br /><br />The dialogue was smart, witty, and hilarious when it was supposed to be. Each character in the movie ws so endearing in their own way and had such cute and funny quirks. The ensemble cast was so perfect and worked so well with each other. and I can see why they all wre nominated for the Actor/Actress Supporting Actor/Actress roles!!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, you NEED TO WATCH IT!! It is definitely a must see!! I can't wait for this movie to come out on BluRay, I will definitely be adding this to my movie collection!

0307950654|4.0|Death Comes to Pemberley by P.D. James is a national best seller, and with good reason. P.D. James crafts a timeless mystery tale hinging on the cornerstone of the literary genius Jane Austen.  As any Austen fan will remember, Pemberley is the estate of which Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice make their home.<br /><br />James takes this landscape, nestled in the woodlands of the Derbyshire estate, and expertly creates a sequel to Austen's most beloved novel. Several years after the marriage of Darcy and Elizabeth, murder befalls their home.  Lydia, the youngest of the Bennet sisters, is betrothed to a the questionable Mr. George Wickham and on the eve of Lady Anne's ball, arrives in utter hysterics over the death of her husband, whom she is certain rots in the woods as she cries out in the night. Darcy, ever practical and respectable, launches a search party made up of guests spending the evening in their home only to stumble upon a very alive George Wickham and a less than lifelike Captain Denny. Thus begins the search for the true killer in the woods.<br /><br />Weaved with language true to Austen's form, readers of of 19th-century prose will appreciate James's adaptation of life at Pemberley.  The characters are both loveable and deplorable. I, myself, enjoyed viewing Elizabeth Bennet, the absolute spit-fire of a woman from Pride and Prejudice, as a more tame and reverent person.  While I loved her as a single women with bouts of feminist views in a time where feminism didn't exist, I also appreciated the way James creates her as a kept women and mother, loyal to Darcy and their children, in this sequel. I believe both women have merit in the schemata of a heroine.<br /><br />Pemberely is a living, breathing organism of which the critical depiction of life hinges upon.  Death Comes to Pemberely certainly upholds the literary merit of Austen's original depiction so long ago. James not only emulates Austen's writing style, but brings new life to an age old classic sure to please audiences anew.<br /><br />P.D. James is from London, England. She is the author of more than 20 novels, predominately crime or mystery. She's been given several awards for her writing and has spot on her website for \\"Mystery Writing Lessons.\\" For more information about P.D. James, visit her official website at [...]<br />An Excerpt from the novel:<br /><br />AUTHOR'S NOTE<br /><br />I owe an apology to the shade of Jane Austen for involving her beloved Elizabeth in the trauma of a murder investigation, especially as in the fi nal chapter of Mansfield Park Miss Austen made her views plain: \\"Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery. I quit such odious subjects as soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody not greatly in fault themselves to tolerable comfort, and to have done with all the rest.\\" No doubt she would have replied to my apology by saying that, had she wished to dwell on such odious subjects, she would have written this story herself, and done it better.<br /><br />P. D. James, 2011<br /><br />PROLOGUE<br /><br />The Bennets of Longbourn<br /><br />It was generally agreed by the female residents of Meryton that Mr. and Mrs. Bennet of Longbourn had been fortunate in the disposal in marriage of four of their fi ve daughters. Meryton, a small market town in Hertfordshire, is not on the route of any tours of pleasure, having neither beauty of setting nor a distinguished history, while its only great house, Netherfi eld Park, although impressive, is not mentioned in books about the county's notable architecture. The town has an assembly room where dances are regularly held but no theatre, and the chief entertainment takes place in private houses where the boredom of dinner parties and whist tables, always with the same company, is relieved by gossip.<br /><br />A family of five unmarried daughters is sure of attracting the sympathetic concern of all their neighbours, particularly where other diversions are few, and the situation of the Bennets was especially unfortunate. In the absence of a male heir, Mr. Bennet's estate was entailed on his nephew, the Reverend William Collins, who, as Mrs. Bennet was fond of loudly lamenting, could turn her and her daughters out of the house before her husband was cold in his grave. Admittedly, Mr. Collins had attempted to make such redress as lay in his power. At some inconvenience to himself, but with the approval of his formidable patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh, he had left his parish at Hunsford in Kent to visit the Bennets with the charitable intention of selecting a bride from the fi ve daughters. This intention was received by Mrs. Bennet with enthusiastic approval but she warned him that Miss Bennet, the eldest, was likely to be shortly engaged. His choice of Elizabeth, the second in seniority and beauty, had met with a resolute rejection and he had been obliged to seek a more sympathetic response to his pleading from Elizabeth's friend Miss Charlotte Lucas. Miss Lucas had accepted his proposal with gratifying alacrity and the future which Mrs. Bennet and her daughters could expect was settled, not altogether to the general regret of their neighbours. On Mr. Bennet's death, Mr. Collins would install them in one of the larger cottages on the estate where they would receive spiritual comfort from his administrations and bodily sustenance from the leftovers from Mrs. Collins's kitchen augmented by the occasional gift of game or a side of bacon.<br /><br />But from these benefi ts the Bennet family had a fortunate escape. By the end of 1799 Mrs. Bennet could congratulate herself on being the mother of four married daughters. Admittedly the marriage of Lydia, the youngest, aged only sixteen, was not propitious. She had eloped with Lieutenant George Wickham, an offi cer in the militia which had been stationed at Meryton, an escapade which was confidently expected to end, as all such adventures deserve, in her desertion by Wickham, banishment from her home, rejection from society and the fi nal degradation which decency forbade the ladies to mention. The marriage had, however, taken place, the first news being brought by a neighbour, William Goulding, when he rode past the Longbourn coach and the newly married Mrs. Wickham placed her hand on the open window so that he could see the ring. Mrs. Bennet's sister, Mrs. Philips, was assiduous in circulating her version of the elopement, that the couple had been on their way to Gretna Green but had made a short stop in London to enable Wickham to inform a godmother of his forthcoming nuptials, and, on the arrival of Mr. Bennet in search of his daughter, the couple had accepted the family's suggestion that the intended marriage could more conveniently take place in London. No one believed this fabrication, but it was acknowledged that Mrs. Philips's ingenuity in devising it deserved at least a show of credulity. George Wickham, of course, could never be accepted in Meryton again to rob the female servants of their virtue and the shopkeepers of their profit, but it was agreed that, should his wife come among them, Mrs. Wickham should be afforded the tolerant forbearance previously accorded to Miss Lydia Bennet.<br /><br />There was much speculation about how the belated marriage had been achieved. Mr. Bennet's estate was hardly worth two thousand pounds a year, and it was commonly felt that Mr. Wickham would have held out for at least fi ve hundred and all his Meryton and other bills being paid before consenting to the marriage. Mrs. Bennet's brother, Mr. Gardiner, must have come up with the money. He was known to be a warm man, but he had a family and no doubt would expect repayment from Mr. Bennet. There was considerable anxiety in Lucas Lodge that their son- in- law's inheritance might be much diminished by this necessity, but when no trees were felled, no land sold, no servants put off and the butcher showed no disinclination to provide Mrs. Bennet with her customary weekly order, it was assumed that Mr. Collins and dear Charlotte had nothing to fear and that, as soon as Mr. Bennet was decently buried, Mr. Collins could take possession of the Longbourn estate with every confidence that it had remained intact.<br /><br />But the engagement which followed shortly after Lydia's marriage, that of Miss Bennet and Mr. Bingley of Netherfi eld Park, was received with approbation. It was hardly unexpected; Mr. Bingley's admiration for Jane had been apparent from their fi rst meeting at an assembly ball. Miss Bennet's beauty, gentleness and the naive optimism about human nature which inclined her never to speak ill of anyone made her a general favourite. But within days of the engagement of her eldest to Mr. Bingley being announced, an even greater triumph for Mrs. Bennet was noised abroad and was at first received with incredulity. Miss Elizabeth Bennet, the second daughter, was to marry Mr. Darcy, the owner of Pemberley, one of the greatest houses in Derbyshire and, it was rumoured, with an income of ten thousand pounds a year.<br /><br />It was common knowledge in Meryton that Miss Lizzy hated Mr. Darcy, an emotion in general held by those ladies and gentlemen who had attended the first assembly ball at which Mr. Darcy had been present with Mr. Bingley and his two sisters, and at which he had given adequate evidence of his pride and arrogant disdain of the company, making it clear, despite the prompting of his friend Mr. Bingley, that no woman present was worthy to be his partner. Indeed, when Sir William Lucas had introduced Elizabeth to him, Mr. Darcy had declined to dance with her, later telling Mr. Bingley that she was not pretty enough to tempt him. It was taken for granted that no woman could be happy as Mrs. Darcy for, as Maria Lucas pointed out, \\"Who would want to have that disagreeable face opposite you at the breakfast table for the rest of your life?\\"<br /><br />But there was no cause to blame Miss Elizabeth Bennet for taking a more prudent and optimistic view. One cannot have everything in life and any young lady in Meryton would have endured more than a disagreeable face at the breakfast table to marry ten thousand a year and to be mistress of Pemberley. The ladies of Meryton, as in duty bound, were happy to sympathise with the afflicted and to congratulate the fortunate but there should be moderation in all things, and Miss Elizabeth's triumph was on much too grand a scale. Although they conceded that she was pretty enough and had fine eyes, she had nothing else to recommend her to a man with ten thousand a year and it was not long before a coterie of the most influential gossips concocted an explanation: Miss Lizzy had been determined to capture Mr. Darcy from the moment of their first meeting. And when the extent of her strategy had become apparent it was agreed that she had played her cards skilfully from the very beginning. Although Mr. Darcy had declined to dance with her at the assembly ball, his eyes had been frequently on her and her friend Charlotte who, after years of husband-seeking, was extremely adroit at identifying any sign of a possible attachment, and had warned Elizabeth against allowing her obvious partiality for the attractive and popular Lieutenant George Wickham to cause her to offend a man of ten times his consequence.<br /><br />And then there was the incident of Miss Bennet's dinner engagement at Netherfield when, due to her mother's insistence on her riding rather than taking the family coach, Jane had caught a very convenient cold and, as Mrs. Bennet had planned, was forced to stay for several nights at Netherfi eld. Elizabeth, of course, had set out on foot to visit her, and Miss Bingley's good manners had impelled her to offer hospitality to the unwelcome visitor until Miss Bennet recovered. Nearly a week spent in the company of Mr. Darcy must have enhanced Elizabeth's hopes of success and she would have made the best of this enforced intimacy.<br /><br />Subsequently, at the urging of the youngest Bennet girls, Mr. Bingley had himself held a ball at Netherfi eld, and on this occasion Mr. Darcy had indeed danced with Elizabeth. The chaperones, ranged in their chairs against the wall, had raised their lorgnettes and, like the rest of the company, studied the pair carefully as they made their way down the line. Certainly there had been little conversation between them but the very fact that Mr. Darcy had actually asked Miss Elizabeth to dance and had not been refused was a matter for interest and speculation.<br /><br />The next stage in Elizabeth's campaign was her visit, with Sir William Lucas and his daughter Maria, to Mr. and Mrs. Collins at Hunsford Parsonage. Normally this was surely an invitation which Miss Lizzy should have refused. What possible pleasure could any rational woman take in six weeks of Mr. Collins's company? It was generally known that, before his acceptance by Miss Lucas, Miss Lizzy had been his fi rst choice of bride. Delicacy, apart from any other consideration, should have kept her away from Hunsford. But she had, of course, been aware that Lady Catherine de Bourgh was Mr. Collins's neighbour and patroness, and that her nephew, Mr. Darcy, would almost certainly be at Rosings while the visitors were at the parsonage. Charlotte, who kept her mother informed of every detail of her married life, including the health of her cows, poultry and husband, had written subsequently to say that Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, who was also visiting Rosings, had called at the parsonage frequently during Elizabeth's stay and that Mr. Darcy on one occasion had visited without his cousin when Elizabeth had been on her own. Mrs. Collins was certain that this distinction must confirm that he was falling in love and wrote that, in her opinion, her friend would have taken either gentleman with alacrity had an offer been made; Miss Lizzy had however returned home with nothing settled.<br /><br />But at last all had come right when Mrs. Gardiner and her husband, who was Mrs. Bennet's brother, had invited Elizabeth to accompany them on a summer tour of pleasure. It was to have been as far as the Lakes, but Mr. Gardiner's business responsibilities had apparently dictated a more limited scheme and they would go no further north than Derbyshire. It was Kitty, the fourth Bennet daughter, who had conveyed this news, but no one in Meryton believed the excuse. A wealthy family who could afford to travel from London to Derbyshire could clearly extend the tour to the Lakes had they wished. It was obvious that Mrs. Gardiner, a partner<br /><br />in her favourite niece's matrimonial scheme, had chosen Derbyshire because Mr. Darcy would be at Pemberley, and indeed the Gardiners and Elizabeth, who had no doubt enquired at the inn when the master of Pemberley would be at home, were actually visiting the house when Mr. Darcy returned. Naturally, as a matter of courtesy, the Gardiners were introduced and the party invited to dine at Pemberley, and if Miss Elizabeth had entertained any doubts about the wisdom of her scheme to secure Mr. Darcy, the first sight of Pemberley had confirmed her determination to fall in love with him at the first convenient moment. Subsequently he and his friend Mr. Bingley had returned to Netherfi eld Park and had lost no time in calling at Longbourn where the happiness of Miss Bennet and Miss Elizabeth was finally and triumphantly secured. The engagement, despite its brilliance, gave less pleasure than had Jane's. Elizabeth had never been popular, indeed the more perceptive of the Meryton ladies occasionally suspected that Miss Lizzy was privately laughing at them. They also accused her of being sardonic, and although there was uncertainty about the meaning of the word, they knew that it was not a desirable quality in a woman, being one which gentlemen particularly disliked. Neighbours whose jealousy of such a triumph exceeded anysatisfaction in the prospect of the union were able to console themselves by averring that Mr. Darcy's pride and arrogance and his wife's caustic wit would ensure that they lived together in the utmost misery for which even Pemberley and ten thousand a year could offer no consolation.<br /><br />Allowing for such formalities without which grand nuptials could hardly be valid, the taking of likenesses, the busyness of lawyers, the buying of new carriages and wedding clothes, the marriage of Miss Bennet to Mr. Bingley and Miss Elizabeth to Mr. Darcy took place on the same day at Longbourn church with surprisingly little delay. It would have been the happiest day of Mrs. Bennet's life had she not been seized with palpitations during the service, brought on by fear that Mr. Darcy's formidable aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, might appear in the church door to forbid the marriage, and it was not until after the final blessing that she could feel secure in her triumph.<br /><br />It is doubtful whether Mrs. Bennet missed the company of her second daughter, but her husband certainly did. Elizabeth had always been his favourite child. She had inherited his intelligence, something of his sharp wit, and his pleasure in the foibles and inconsistencies of their neighbours, and Longbourn House was a lonelier and less rational place without her company. Mr. Bennet was a clever and reading man whose library was both a refuge and the source of his happiest hours. He and Darcy rapidly came to the conclusion that they liked each other and thereafter, as is common with friends, accepted their different quirks of character as evidence of the other's superior intellect. Mr. Bennet's visits to Pemberley, frequently made when he was least expected, were chiefly spent in the library, one of the fi nest in private hands, from which it was difficult to extract him, even for meals. He visited the Bingleys at Highmarten less frequently since, apart from Jane's excessive preoccupation with the comfort and well- being of her husband and children, which occasionally Mr. Bennet found irksome, there were few new books and periodicals to tempt him. Mr. Bingley's money had originally come from trade. He had inherited no family library and had only thought of setting one up after his purchase of Highmarten House. In this project both Darcy and Mr. Bennet were very ready to assist. There are few activities so agreeable as spending a friend's money to your own satisfaction and his benefit, and if the buyers were periodically tempted to extravagance, they comforted themselves with the thought that Bingley could afford it. Although the library shelves, designed to Darcy's specification and approved by Mr. Bennet, were as yet by no means full, Bingley was able to take pride in the elegant arrangement of the volumes and the gleaming leather of the bindings, and occasionally even opened a book and was seen reading it when the season or the weather was unpropitious for hunting, fishing or shooting.<br /><br />Mrs. Bennet had only accompanied her husband to Pemberley on two occasions. She had been received by Mr. Darcy with kindness and forbearance but was too much in awe of her son by marriage to wish to repeat the experience. Indeed, Elizabeth suspected that her mother had greater pleasure in regaling her neighbours with the wonders of Pemberley, the size and beauty of the gardens, the grandeur of the house, the number of servants and the splendour of the dining table than she had in experiencing them. Neither Mr. Bennet nor his wife were frequent visitors of their grandchildren. Five daughters born in quick succession had left them with a lively memory of broken nights, screaming babies, a head nurse who complained constantly, and recalcitrant nursery maids. A preliminary inspection shortly after the birth of each grandchild confirmed the parents' assertion that the child was remarkably handsome and already exhibiting a formidable intelligence, after which they were content to receive regular progress reports.<br /><br />Mrs. Bennet, greatly to her two elder daughters' discomfort, had loudly proclaimed at the Netherfield ball that she expected Jane's marriage to Mr. Bingley to throw her younger daughters in the way of other wealthy men, and to general surprise it was Mary who dutifully fulfilled this very natural maternal prophecy. No one expected Mary to marry. She was a compulsive reader but without discrimination or understanding, an assiduous practiser at the pianoforte but devoid of talent, and a frequent deliverer of platitudes which had neither wisdom nor wit. Certainly she never displayed any interest in the male sex. An assembly ball was a penance to be endured only because it offered an opportunity for her to take centre stage at the pianoforte and, by the judicious use of the sustaining pedal, to stun the audience into submission. But within two years of Jane's marriage, Mary was the wife of the Reverend Theodore Hopkins, the rector of the parish adjacent to Highmarten.<br /><br />The Highmarten vicar had been indisposed and Mr. Hopkins had for three Sundays taken the services. He was a thin, melancholy bachelor, aged thirty-five, given to preaching sermons of inordinate length and complicated theology, and had therefore naturally acquired the reputation of being a very clever man, and although he could hardly be described as rich, he enjoyed a more than adequate private income in addition to his stipend. Mary, a guest at Highmarten on one of the Sundays on which he preached, was introduced to him by Jane at the church door after the service and immediately impressed him by her compliments on his discourse, her endorsement of the interpretation he had taken of the text, and such frequent references to the relevance of Fordyce's sermons that Jane, anxious for her husband and herself to get away to their Sunday luncheon of cold meats and salad, invited him to dinner on the following day. Further invitations followed and within three months Mary became Mrs. Theodore Hopkins with as little public interest in the marriage as there had been display at the ceremony.<br /><br />One advantage to the parish was that the food at the vicarage notably improved. Mrs. Bennet had brought up her daughters to appreciate the importance of a good table in promoting domestic harmony and attracting male guests. Congregations hoped that the vicar's wish to return promptly to conjugal felicity might shorten the services, but although his girth increased, the length of his sermons remained the same. The two settled down in perfect accord, except initially for Mary's demand that she should have a book room of her own in which she could read in peace. This was acquired by converting the one good spare bedroom for her sole use, with the advantage of promoting domestic amity while making it impossible for them to invite their relations to stay.<br /><br />By the autumn of 1803, in which year Mrs. Bingley and Mrs. Darcy were celebrating six years of happy marriage, Mrs. Bennet had only one daughter, Kitty, for whom no husband had been found. Neither Mrs. Bennet nor Kitty was much concerned at the matrimonial failure. Kitty enjoyed the prestige and indulgence of being the only daughter at home, and with her regular visits to Jane, where she was a great favourite with the children, was enjoying a life that had never before been so satisfactory. The visits of Wickham and Lydia were hardly an advertisement for matrimony. They would arrive in boisterous good humour to be welcomed effusively by Mrs. Bennet, who always rejoiced to see her favourite daughter. But this initial goodwill soon degenerated into quarrels, recriminations and peevish complaints on the part of the visitors about their poverty and the stinginess of Elizabeth's and Jane's fi nancial support, so that Mrs. Bennet was as glad to see them leave as she was to welcome them back on their next visit. But she needed a daughter at home and Kitty, much improved in amiability and usefulness since Lydia's departure, did very well. By 1803, therefore, Mrs. Bennet could be regarded as a happy woman so far as her nature allowed and had even been known to sit through a four-course dinner in the presence of Sir William and Lady Lucas without once referring to the iniquity of the entail.tour of pleasure.

B000SEI230|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!! It was so beautifully written and he did a very well job describing the characters. Jamie seemed like a really nice person i wish ppl were like her. I loved it <3!!! I was even crying like a bby. I was on my way to skool and i stopped reading bcus i knew i was gonna cry. In the end i did. AMAZING!!! LOVE IT <3!!!
B0057B8PT0|5.0|Olly Murs is back with his second album. Onxce again, the versatility of songs on this album will have something on it for everyone.This also includes Olly's US debut song, &#34;Heart Skips a Beat,&#34; which he performed live on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
B008RPB7AW|4.0|I found this a very interesting book.  Being a dog owner I got lots of insight into dog behaviour and enjoyed it very much.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Yet another addition to my collection of this series. I absolutely love this show and can watch the episodes over and over again and still laugh in all the same spots.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|I had heard this movie was very good, but still had reservations about it. I was pleasantly surprised because it was a great movie.. would definitely recommend it.
B00916TU00|5.0|Been a big Olly Murs fan ever since seeing his audition video for the X Factor UK. Olly's first two albums had the same great appeal....Right Time, Right Place has different beats and styles, with a great mix of ballads and up-temp songs.<br /><br />Love me some Olly Murs!!!
B00BMVTTJ4|4.0|As a lover of the book, I was a bit leery of watching this movie lest it be a train wreck. However, with a few exceptions, I thought the movie was well-done, especially the special effects. The movie is not completely true to the book, but it does remain fairly true to the plot and characters. The cinematography is really quite good, and the sets and costumes are remarkably close to what I imagine when I read the book. The acting is also very good, especially Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman. Andy Serkis as Gollum is just extraordinary - watch the video blogs at the end of the film for glimpses of Andy during filming. I am in awe of how in character he is. My main gripe with this movie (and why I didn't give it five stars) is that the producers split the book into three movies, and the first one is quite long considering that there are two more to follow. You would think given the total number of hours of filming will be done by the end, that the script would have followed the book word-for-word. All the books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy became single movies, so the only reason for three movies from this one book is blatant commercialism. Sadly, I am sure I will succumb and see all three movies, thus validating the producers' decision.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Another addition to my collection in this series. Not sure what else to write here, but just to mimic what I wrote on the other ratins for this show, that I love it!!
B005FVFWOI|5.0|Sounds deep and crisp and even. A classic album. Reinforces my belief that Ian Anderson is an incredibly talented folk-rock genius. This is from 1971 and he is still going strong!
B003L77G6A|5.0|What can I say? I have been a fan of this series from day one and will continue to be a fan. Have all of the seasons so far and can't wait to order season 5
B001NU4CM8|5.0|Wakeman at its best. This is a classic Wakemen music piece. I like it together with a similar album King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Both are great to listen.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a great game. Only wish that it was longer and it was longer than most of these style games that I`ve played. I cant wait for the second one.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I've tried a lot of other editing apps and by far I prefer this one. It's great for me. THE ONLY thing I would change is that I would like to be able to upload straight to facebook.
B00005JKGO|4.0|Like la Strada this is a film difficult to assess as enjoyable or fun, for even though many of it scenes seem to be appealing to the audiences - Anita Ekberg jumping in a fountain in Rome, for example - underneath the surface lies something dark and sinister about the human condition. Besides the Ekberg scene, there is an attempted suicide, a real suicide and killing of children, and an invalid boy is stampeded to death by a religiously excited crowd. Amidst all this is Marcello, who lives without purpose, and finds meaning only on the banal and superficial, be it physically beautiful women like Anita, or pseudo-intellectuals afraid of facing the challenges of the modern world. The film is undoubtedly enticing albeit sad at the same time. The viewer may be momentarily enticed by the pleasures that Marcello seeks, even including a strip tease by a woman who resembles Elizabeth Taylor; only to be shocked by the tragic. At the end, Marcello remains alive, but the audience suspects that he is not alive in a more meaningful way. This film is great for someone who likes to try new things in films.
B009A87Z6U|4.0|Many people say it's a bad movie compared to Casino Royale.  However, if you are a Daniel Craig fan and you enjoyed Casino Royale and Skyfall (I am, and I did), you'll still get a lot of enjoyment out of this very entertaining movie.
0385504225|5.0|I was not prepared to pay $5 and receive such a nice book. Was a pleasure to read and visualize what Dan Brown is talking about.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|IT REALLY IS PRETTY NICE, THE LEATHER HAS A GREAT FEEL TO IT.  THE ABILITY TO USE IT AS A STAND BOTH, HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY IS A HUGE PLUS!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Very good. I have all the rest and have enjoyed watching them . I would recommend the set very highly
B0061PEAUY|2.0|Simple language, boring generally speaking and NOTHING like the TV show and I hope her other books are better but I do not intend to order any more
1616550414|5.0|Whether you are new to the series and like the art work or have followed each game this is a great art and information book for fans. While a good portion does focus more on Skyward Sword that I would have needed ( big fan od Twilight princess ), the book covers characters, settings weapons and plot details of every iteration of the game I could recall. And for those dire hard fans, it even has timeline information for how the games tie together chronologically.
B00AW57L96|5.0|I absolutely loved What Alice Forgot and the Hypnotists Love Story, so was super excited to see this had come out.  And it was again, a wonderful read.  It's a rare author who can be such a consistently great story teller.<br /><br />This book tells the story of several people, whose lives become intertwined and the twists that are offered as the story comes to a head could never be assumed.  I hate reading reviews that try to tell the story, and possibly ruin any surprises, so I apologize for the vague description...  Sadly this book cost me a good night's sleep, but a price I happily pay!<br /><br />A fantastic escape into other people's lives that you won't want to put down.  Special thanks to the author for the last chapter - that was quite simply, the perfect ending.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Both my kids 3 and 5 have fun using this app and they are learning from it as well!! Recommend it!!
0345803493|5.0|had to get the rest of the trilogy as i received the first book as a gift got the other books seperate.
B009KEN87O|4.0|4 stars instead of 5 simply because I feel the controls need some work.  It's the nature of these type of games to have the view blocked by hand/finger due to the dragging on screen but this causes frustration.  My suggestion would be either adding tilt controls or a floating joystick option or a zone on the bottom quarter of screen that ship wouldn't come past.  Other then that, fun game, love the retro graphics and music.
0345803507|5.0|book was a good read, price was excellant received volumne 1 as a xmas gift and had to get the rest of the series. it was less expensive to buy them all seperate than the trilogy set.
1451608659|3.0|This was a book I added to my library request list around the time of the London Olympics. I wasn't sure what to expect and was actually pleasantly surprised. It was nice having a shorter book I could finish in 2 days.<br /><br />Dominique Moceanu shot to fame at a 14 years old as the youngest gymnast on the US Olympic team, and brought home a gold medal. Behind the smile was a young girl who had tough coaches, parents who pushed her hard, but even then, she loved the sport. The following years lead to emancipation from her family, experimenting with drugs, and the discover of a sister who was put up for adoption.<br /><br />I appreciated that the book didn't wind up becoming a pity party for her, but she writes of her ups and downs in a straight forward way, focusing on the positive. She still loves gymnastics, coaches and writes children's books about gymnasts.
B0045XICB2|5.0|movie kept me on edge of my seat. Delivered more than I thought. I would recommend this. Love the whole series.
0307740919|5.0|I liked the book HOME.  I was Toni Morrison at her best.  Although it was not one of  her<br />thick book the characters were developed fully.  Ms. Morrison showed her poetic style<br />made her words so discriptive.  I loved the book.
B003F9G8B8|3.0|The movie was great, but, it lacked CC. I have viewed this movie with CC. Why do you not include more movies with CC in your library? Is it too expensive to provide for the few people that require it and would enjoy the movie more?
B007IXWL2C|1.0|These books got a lot of hype.  When my daughter told me she was reading them, I was concerned about the message and treatment of women.  So I decided to read them myself.  The writing was terrible.  The sex passages became boring as I waited for the story to progress.  I did get through the second book but just could not move past the first few chapters of the third and gave it up.  I grew up with romance novels that were much more erotic and interesting than these.  This author could take some lessons from Kathleen Woodiwiss.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|it is a little hard, I am getting better at it.  I wish the improvements were cheaper.  the coins are expensive in real money.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|Good for creative girls  of any age, who enjoy trying new hairstyles. Decorate the hairstyles with different colors and assessories and create your own unique styles. Choices are a little limited, but it is still fun.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This was such a heartbreaking but beautifully written story that could happen to any one of us. I liked the way the author wrote about each family member's reactions, compassion, and also frustrations. She also was able to inject a little humor in some circumstances.
B005KAH7QU|2.0|Nicely shot and edited, but the content was lacking. This movie didn't go anywhere. Unsuccessful in delivering its message, whatever it may have been.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Cute movie and will probably end up buying.  My 2 sons were asking for it by name the next day.  Loved the reference to some old video games too.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|The disc set arrived quickly, and was even more than I expected. The description stated that it was Blu-ray, however it was also dvd. So it can be viewed on any device. Thank you from a very very satisfied customer.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|so i deleted it. it was fun before that though, bringing back memories at the arcade game (3 more words to send review)
1567184855|4.0|I had this book before but it was lost so I bought it again and the book is very good and I have recommended it to several of my friends and family.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love the app, doing puzzles is relaxing. I do them on my kindle and at times scrolling the pieces is difficult, either no movement or moving a piece out. Maybe add a slide bar instead of scrolling on the pieces?  Also I've had to leave puzzles without finishing and I was not able to resume puzzle twice now, had to start over :(  Still love doing the puzzles though!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but I think Amazon should make it where if it phone or eat ever it using is reset u should be able to get all it coins back and everything that would make it even better
B008XG1X18|5.0|love the app, no problems at all, easy to use and love how the selected pin magnifies over the page.
B000FC10MU|4.0|A pageturner, never a dull moment. For me its the first meeting with Gaiman and I will absolutely read more from him.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This is one of my favorite &#34;thriller&#34; movies.  Great acting by Christien Bale (Batman) and Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) Michael Cain (The Dark Knight).  And David  Bowie acts?  Yes, he is perfect as Nikola Tesla.<br /><br />The first time you watch this movie you will be hooked.  Tied up and hooked, actually-this movie is, after all, about Magicians.<br /><br />&#34;Sixth Sense&#34;  is known for it's surprise ending but  In the Prestige they give more clues and I still didn't figure it out.  Maybe I didn't actually WANT to figure it out.<br /><br />I was worried about  giving too many hints and spoiling the ending for you.  But THEY show-and-tell you how they did it.  They lead you by the hand through the clues and make sure you know how they did it.  But for me it was like watching for the rabbit when the magician sticks his hand in the hat.  And then he pulls out a volkswagen....<br /><br />Are you watching closely?
B000T45CDM|5.0|Watching Depp's character evolve and his (the character's) role overtake his life is a study in masterful character development.  Pacino mugs and chews scenery, as usual, but this movie is about Depp.  The rest of the cast are also wonderful.
B00ANDPGJE|4.0|The BBC's House of Cards is a must-see before you watch Kevin Spacey's version.  The acting is top-notch and, considering that the show is more than 20 years old, the video and audio quality on the Blu-ray version are not bad.
B006T5GTK0|3.0|A good but dated movie based on the wonderful Neville Shute book of the same title.  I highly recommend the book..<br /><br />The TV mini-series made in the '80s starring Helen Morse and Bryan Brown is much better - one of my all time favorites.  To be fair, it's hard to capture all of a big story in a 90 minute movie and a mini-series can go into the essential details.<br /><br />I have an old VHS copy of the TV mini-series and would dearly love to have it on DVD.
B007SRZULW|5.0|Jane Austen struggled to get Pride and Prejudice finally into print.  Finding a publisher was not easy (she even considered self-publishing), but she did not give up.  During the years the manuscript sat on her shelf, she reworked it and changed its title from First Impressions to the even more plot-descriptive Pride and Prejudice.  Now, 200 years later, that novel is still one of the best known, and best loved, books in the world.<br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. Bennet live with their five daughters in Longbourn, a Hertfordshire town in which nothing is more important to young ladies and their mothers than making the right match.  A man with a fixed annual income is a must, but even better is a handsome man with an annual income.  And the highly competitive (if a bit scatterbrained) Mrs. Bennet is ready to start marrying off her daughters.  This is, in fact, to her husband's dismay, all the woman thinks about.<br /><br />However, the Bennet girls, beautiful as most of them are, face some stiff competition in their little town, and when a military troop makes temporary headquarters there, the game is on.  But it is when two wealthy young men take up temporary quarters in one of the county's most spectacular homes and, at the same time, a foolish young preacher comes courting the girls that the fun really begins.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice, considering its age, is remarkably easy for today's readers to read and enjoy.  Austen's witty dialogue and her writing style work as well today as when the book was first published, ensuring that the novel will continue to entertain readers for many generations to come.  It does not hurt, too, that Elizabeth Bennet, the second of the Bennet daughters - and Austen's personal favorite of all her heroines - is one of literature's most memorable characters.  Elizabeth, though, is surrounded and supported by a whole cast of characters that interact perfectly to make Pride and Prejudice the very special book that it is.<br />There are the wealthy (Misters Bingley and Darcy and their sisters), the super-wealthy (Lady Catherine), the foolish (Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet, in particular), a scoundrel (Mr. Wickham), the rest of the Bennet sisters and their long-suffering father, and a town filled with friends and rivals.<br /><br />New readers are likely to be surprised by how much fun Pride and Prejudice is, but this is precisely the reason so many re-read it on a regular basis.  Jane Austen wrote romantic comedy before there was such a thing.  She was way ahead of her time stylistically, especially when it comes to dialogue, and it all comes together beautifully in Pride and Prejudice.  This one is not to be missed.wealthy (Misters Bingley and Darcy and their sisters), the super-wealthy (Lady Catherine), the foolish (Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet, in particular), a scoundrel (Mr. Wickham), the rest of the Bennet sisters and their long-suffering father, and a town filled with friends and rivals.<br /><br />New readers are likely to be surprised by how much fun Pride and Prejudice is, but this is precisely the reason so many re-read it on a regular basis.

B003UBTX6S|4.0|I am enjoying this series, I am able to connect with the characters and feel,the books are moving at a good pace.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I don't think this game is really fun...a little confusing at first though but fun after figured out how to play
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This is the Scorsese/DeNiro/Pesci nexus right here!  Casino is round two.  Each film has a masterful performance from an unexpected source.  In Goodfellas, it's Ray Liotta who brings us along for this hairy arc of Henry Hill's life.  The highs are very high and the lows are even lower.  His depiction of cocaine use gone out of control is absolutely harrowing.  Dances with Wolves was a fine movie, but this one should have won the best picture that year!
0345529057|4.0|I am a big fan of the current HBO series based on Martin's books.  So when my grandson called and said he wanted to read them, I didn't hesitate to gift him the box set.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Acting is consistently very good, the ethical dilemma are very timely, and the writing is always top notch.  Very creative writing.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I've read this book at least 5 times.<br />My astrophysicist neigbor named his firstborn \\"Ender\\".<br />All I have to do is quote \\"The enemy's gate is down\\" and many of my friends get the joke.<br /><br />This book has been hugely influential with many (smart) people around me. Don't be fooled thinking this is a \\"hardcore sci-fi\\" novel that will test your knowledge of relativity and quantum mechanics. This is a book about human nature and the conflict between greatness and love.<br /><br />This book is a pleasure to read, it may inspire you be a better version of yourself, you may get insights into the meaning of leadership through excellence and its accompanying solitude.<br /><br />After reading this book, when you find yourself paralized facing an overwhelming task you will heard a voice saying \\"Remembrer, the enemy's gate is down.\\" You will then laugh and dare to try the impossible... perhaps then you will win.
0744014549|5.0|The book is 270 pages long , containing all kinds of conceptual artwork and featuring writing about each section of the game. Upon first glance it appears to be mostly spoiler free , and can be appreciated for its level of detail. You can tell that the creators put their heart into it for this game. Definitely worth it for the price.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|I told my kid we would try the demo and after a couple days, if he still liked it, we would buy the paid version. I didn't know the demo version would time out after a half hour or hour or whatever it was. So to appease a distraught 5 year old, I went ahead and bought the full version. Which he now doesn't play. Because we still don't understand it. Which we would have known if we had had some more time with the demo. So I guess the developers get an A+ for separating me from my money so easily.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|One of Clint Eastwood's real masterpieces.  He, Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman are all perfect.  The character arc of William Munny (Eastwood) is dark and the conclusion shows the hell that follows with his choices.  This movie is a subtle study in the consequences of choices and people's inability to let go of their past.
B0055MBQOM|4.0|On a recent book project, I used the ColorMunki to calibrate my monitor. Proof prints showed that the color match was extremely close. The actual final book output was also very close to the actual calibrated screen image.<br /><br />The ColorMunki is not difficult to use.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to beginners and advanced alike for accurate monitor calibration.
B008RTE09S|5.0|I hadn't seen this since it was first released it the movie theater.  This took me back to before I had any real responsiblities and life was ahead of me. Highly recommended.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Nice retro arcade shooter. Control s are easy making the game fun and addictive. I usually dont pkay this type of fame on my phone because of the screen size etc. But this one works somehow and is very engaging
B009KEN87O|5.0|really good retro game.. reminds me of megamania on the Atari I was so addicted to that game. I have a feeling I will be addicted to this one too. great game
B00AEFXUL2|1.0|What a disappointment ... this one turned out to be a lame version of Rio Bravo ... Duke playing a gunhand ... James Caan (pre Godfather days) playing the Ricky Nelson part ... Robert Mitchem  the booze up Dean Martin ... Arthur Hunnicut  the Walter Brennan role ... Charlene Holt playing a better role than the poor acting from Angie Dickinson ... missing is Gonzalez Gonzalez made up with a bunch of hispanics saying \\"jefe\\" ... their ONLY line ... John Wayne doing his usual over acting performance ... and director Howard Hawks who should have retired in the early '50s but I guess needed the money. I would only say FORGET watching this travesty and watch Rio Bravo instead which is only a bit better but watchable ...
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I think it's safe to assume that this film will go down as one of the greatest musicals that was put on the silver screen of the 21st century. Before this film, I was not even aware of Les Mis&eacute;rables, and I was surprised I wasn't considering the fame it has as a broadway already, but during the time that all the hype and trailers were publicizing the movie, I decided to find out what the big deal was. I found out at that point that it already was a huge epic novel by Victor Hugo from the 19th century (of which I am still reading), a famously longstanding broadway play, and now a highly anticipated film. With only a handful in mind, most musicals have not really caught my attention in the last decade. This film captures what broadway cannot. My mother who has seen the broadway long before this movie, has stated that this film beats the broadway by a longshot. I understood her point. In broadway it's hard to understand what exactly is happening on stage (especially when you are nowhere near the stage.) This film had no problem whatsoever depicting the story and plot, which to me is still very hard to accomplish on film. The cast that was assembled was perfect to me. Some actors/actresses may have better or stronger voices then each other but everyone of them in the movie sang their hearts out and you can tell they put everything they had into this movie to make it legendary. All in all, I have no complaints, others might be more loyal to the broadway which is fine because I do have a lot of respect for it since it laid the catalyst for this film, but this movie is just awesome in itself! I highly recommend this film to watch before you die! It has every single human emotion that you can possibly experience from despair to happiness. If any film can bring you even close to tears (especially for the men out there), this would be a top contender!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Moving from  one scene was a  bit frustrating as the hotspot was too close to the inventory spot. More 4.5 than 4 stars. Great art! Am looking foward to the next chapter.
B009AMAJPA|5.0|DEAD MAN DOWN is a very engrossing and engaging tale of revenge. What starts out as a totally confusing and seemingly unrelated series of events ever so slowly comes together in a thoroughly riveting climax. Director Niels Arden Oplev's tale is methodically paced and ultimately mesmerizing as the story unfolds. Colin Farrell gives one of his best performances in a very underplayed characterization and Noomi Rapace is totally impulsive in her captivating performance opposite Farrell. Together they are amazingly convincing as the viewer never is given a chance to get a good read on these two actors who powerfully and so subtly reveal just bits and pieces of their broken and twisted lives that by happenstance place them on a singular road of salvation for their own humanity. To say too much would give the plot away, but by the end the entire experience gels in a visually cathartic conclusion. I highly recommend this film.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Simple design, Good price, Good function.<br />Seiko is great watch brand that is reliable and beautiful. And I like that.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Drama, humor and best of all zombies! Like the graphic novels, the walking dead does not disappoint as a television series. My favorite show! Like how it deviates from the novel story but preserves the basic character plots. Everyone needs to check this show out!!
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The slow mo parts where someone was on the slo mo drug were a bit boring to me. Rest of the film was great and the movie should probably have been called \\"Dredd and Anderson\\" because they have equal screen time and they are equally cool in their own ways imo.<br />Hopefully they do another.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Have you always dreamed of playing the electric guitar but never taken that first step? Don't watch this movie. Have you grown up loving great riffs and hooks from the masters, losing yourself in their induced air-guitar fantasies? Don't watch this movie. Have you yearned to know more of the personal story and history behind the Edge, Jimmy Page and Jack White's obvious guitar passion? Don't watch this movie. YOU WILL BE ADDICTED. YOU WILL WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER. YOU WILL GO OUT AND BUY YOUR FIRST GUITAR. YOU WILL TAKE LESSONS. YOU WILL FEEL THE PASSION. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP. You've been warned.
B002BI6SMI|2.0|The actress was in her 20s playing a teenager. Fine. Maybe if I'd never seen her performance in the TV show \\"Lost\\", I wouldn't have cringed at her \\"performance\\" in this movie. She was fine in that role as a 20-something.<br />Here, she WAY overdid the gawky excitable-apple-of-daddy's-eye. She's the reason I won't see the sequel. Glad everybody got paid...
B000JQU1VS|5.0|The quality of the Holmes stories has truly stood the test of time. Deeply engrossing, masterfully complicated yet very simple, Sir Arthur was a brilliant author. Each new mystery deepens the richness of the narrative and the characters. Simply put, they should be on any mystery or historical literature fan's reading list. Please give these time honored classics the attention they deserve.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I will give a 5 star on this beacouse It's my favourite move of all time I never get tired of watching the old episodes and the new ones too.Plus great picture quality the best I have ever seen
B0058YPL66|5.0|This show is tv at its finest. Drama and magic, all our favorite characters from the stories of our childhood in present day. Love the way they tell their stories through the present day story lines! Season 2 is on the way!!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I would love this game if the buildings, plants, pretty much everything in the game wasn't so expensive. for example, you have to spend $15000 coins times ten to research Dna and come up with a dinosaur Then you have to pay $100000 coins for the dinosaur.  it takes forever
B005NJU8PA|4.0|First I want to say that I'm a fan of Tim Ferriss' ideas in general. His original book inspired me to go off the beaten path and start working remote, living more the lifestyle I wanted. I'm also a fitness geek and enjoyed the 4 hour body even though I differ on some things with his philosophy. So it was with some excitement that I ordered this new tome.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to discover how disjointed the book is. I really enjoyed the snippet about learning languages and how that fed into 'meta learning' although the actual method was a little thin. This could be Tim not wanting to give away some secret sauce he'll use for a future book, or it could just be he didn't have time to flesh the idea out in more detail since he had to get back to writing the rest. I googled for more and found that this chapter is little more than a slightly expanded version of one of his blog posts, and I suspect many of the sidetracks the book takes are the same.<br /><br />The survival school part is also a little funny. Tim shows his 'city boy' colors, talking about various boy scout level outdoor skills as if he just discovered fire.<br /><br />With those downsides out of the way, if you can forgive the ADD writing style there are a lot of gems to be found here, particularly how to build a proper kitchen for not a lot of money (or a lot if you want), how to make easy versions of restaurant style dishes and how to keep them relatively healthy as well.<br /><br />As I wrote this review I started out giving it 3 stars, but by the time I'd typed to..... here, I've gone back and given it 4. It really is good if you read it as even the author suggests. In chunks and on the areas that interest you at the time.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|Great show! Five stars for the show its self. Mediocre picture quality. It says HD, but is far from it.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I'm always looking for new interesting music and alt-J's An Awesome Wave is... very interesting and different.  I've listened to the entire album a dozen times now!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This film was enjoyable but not great. Clint Eastwood as a sour old man and the story were very predictable. Amy Adams made the film.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful show! Love the characters and attention to detail.  It's my new favorite show!  I can't wait for season 3!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I LOVED the original but when I tried to get this it kept saying it was unable to download. Thats soooooi dumb.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Excellent quality and content!  We are so enjoying watching our favorite show from the 70's as it's timeless!!  Season 1 is voer but we're looking forward to more COLOMBO and great guest stars - it's a blast from the past!!!
B005BW1IEE|4.0|I bought this album for my husband because he kept talking about getting it after he had heard it somewhere -- he seems to be enjoying it a lot.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love the interplay between the two characters and the wit.  It is a fun series- too bad it is only 3 episodes per season!
B00AYATBP6|5.0|This is definitely Wilson's best album so far. The addition of some of the greatest musicians in the world to play on the album of one of the world's best progressive rock composer is definitely a match that makes for an incredible album. The title song also strikes a chord inside me, in that it manages to put forward many of the same feelings I felt during a period of my life where things were very blue-ish grey.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|simply love it!<br />I will recommend it for Hendrix lovers and for those that never heard Jimi before.<br />Go buy it!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thought the book was great and would recommend reading the book after the movie as the book provides a lot of insight into the main character.  I thought the book had a really good climax which was given away in the movie way too early.  But totally enjoyed the characters in the movie.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I wanted to read this book after going through some glowing reviews. I am not suggesting that this is a bad book but can confidently say that it is way too overrated. The premise is good and would have been a good reading if it were 200 to 250 pages long. unfortunately it is a 500 pager and the remaining 250 pages just detail the difficulty of climbing stairs up and down. I understand that the author needs to provide an idea about the size of the silo and all by detailing the difficulty of going up and down the various levels in the silo. However, there was no reason to do it once every 5 pages. I probably skipped 40 % of the pages with out really losing track of the plot.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Of course I loved the movie -- not one of the best Bond movies, but by far not one of the worst.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|The Girl With series is a very good read and though it can be gruesome and violent to women it contains one of the strongest female characters I've encountered in a long time.  It's worth the read.  By the way, if you prefer movies instead of books, stick with the original Swedish version it's closer to the book than the American version is.
1439170916|4.0|I bought this for a friend, having read it previously. It was a great narrative and made a difficult subject comprehensible and very interesting
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I absolutely love to read Stephen King novels and this I have read multiple times and continue to enjoy Derry Maine and the secrets it holds. I still find myself completely enthralled with lives of the characters and the town itself. Feeling all the ups and downs and every twist and turn; knowing what happens in the end I love it and share an equal sadness that the story and circle of friends has  come to an end.
B000FC130E|5.0|Unexpected lovely read for lovers of fantasy. Quick, well put together story.<br /><br />Would love to read the next part of the story or even about the Marquis
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book very much. I fell in love with the characters. So many unexpected twists. I stayed up until 3:00 in the morning even though I had to be at work at 8:30 unable to stop. I was dragging at work but it was worth it. (:
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I have to honestly admit that I didn't much like this the first few times I listened to it. Justin Hayward has written an incredibly diverse body of music since the 60's and is a favorite of mine. His voice is so beautiful and distinctive.<br /><br />This is his first new recording since 1996 and turns out to be well worth the wait.<br /><br />There are quite a few different types of songs on this and after the first week I found myself waking up with some of the melodies in my head. Such is the songwriting brilliance of this man.<br /><br />Although certainly best known for the large body of work with the Moody Blues, he's also created quite a few excellent solo albums over the years. This is an unusual mix of a few different types of music and obviously he put a lot of work into it.<br /><br />Without going into any details and perhaps spoiling the surprise, I'd highly recommend this to anyone.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|plugs right into my outlet on the wall (I have a USB port on the one in my bedroom). Its the perfect length and doesn't wiggle out like my old cord did.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My daughter loves all of these movies - they're fun, light, full of adventure & never send a bad message - great movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game never would be playing if it wasn't for my niece and sister playing. Thanks to them
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Freezes,  unexpected closures then reopens.  Ads popping up without selecting the links.  Starts in background by itself when in my mail.  Spookey...<br />I liked the layout and tightness of the visuals... but... had to remove from device.  I want this app...
B007H1HQW0|1.0|the glass cutter did not cut a single bottle.  Did like the instructions told me and could not cut the glass.
B00881VLCE|5.0|you get a bunch of puzzles but some you purchase but you still have some puzzles. it dose not hve any levels you can do it in any order
0143143492|4.0|This CD is a great way to better understand the book. I listened to it as I drove to and from work.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|This review isn't about the book but the kindle book. I purchased this when it was a Kindle Daily deal and I had heard a lot of discussion about this book previously. I finally got around to reading it and it was a fun quick read but I did notice more than one error. MANY times no spaces after periods leading into the next sentence.Like this. and I think there was even a word or two that were not what I think they were suppose to be. Doesn't anyone proof read these things?
B00BF123WG|4.0|Once again, fits and starts, dropping out in the streaming, having to &#34;try again&#34; and restart the video.... I'm PAYING FOR THIS! Streaming to my TV via XBox has constant problems.  Streaming to my computer seems fine, Netflix streaming to my XBox is fine... it's just Amazon.  Makes it really hard to follow dialogue when the streaming drops out mid-sentence all the time.  If I rented a DVD and it didn't play, I'd get a refund.  If Amazon can't figure out playback, they shouldn't be charging for content.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|What can I say, this a great futuristic story created of Three Worlds: Westworld, Roman and Mediaeval world a fun park where people can explore they fantasies with robots and only $1000 per day. You can shoot them or even make love to them. You can have all the fun under the sun and nothing will go wrong and is't  safe, so they thought. There were problems with robots before, but they choose to ignore it until it was too late and people did not see it coming. Yul Brynner and Richard Benjamin are terrific in it.<br />As far as Blu Ray goes picture shows some grain in the beginning but as movie moves on it improves and overly picture is clean with strong colours. It's worth an upgrade from dvd.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I considered 4 stars because it didn't help with some misspellings, but over all I really like having this tool when I am in doubt about correct pronunciations.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Just finished the 30 day shred and I loved it!!!! It's an amazing workout! It never gets boring and its short enough to fit into even the busiest schedule. You do have to be motivated and push yourself to get the results you are looking for.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|There were many &#34;flashbacks&#34; in this movie and I think Jared Leto is such a fine actor that I was such a believer in the great story line.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I am a fan of flipboard, love it on my iphone and enjoy it on my Kindle.  However, as stated by other reviewers there are problems.  Such as full articles not loading, and many others, all problems I have lived with without complaint.  As of a few hours ago the program has stopped working all together.  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and resetting my Kindle nothing has worked to restore use.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a amazing game! It has really good graphics and has good sound effects.It glitches sometimes but rarely.Great sequel to the first one!  GET THIS GAME
B003QP4NPE|4.0|Initially I was put off by the specificity with which he named the make and model of every car and the explanations of rather mundane internet technology, but as the story developed the former became merely an odd quirk and the latter began to involve more cutting edge or speculative technology and thus was both necessary and interesting.<br /><br />There are a lot of cool and interesting ideas involving wireless networks and wearable computing. I love that he included a bibliography at the end to look into this stuff more. My main problem with the book was the godlike predictive powers of the main antagonist; he's such an amazing designer that everything he designs works perfectly with no iterative re-design process necessary; that detracts from the sense of realism that Suarez otherwise conveys well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Originally got the app for my 4 year old granddaughter.  However, my daughter and myself also enjoy it.<br />It keeps her entertained for quite some time. I really like it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Grandsons love it. They spent many hours playing it. I would suggest this for 4yr old and up to play.
B000H5TVJY|4.0|Christian Bale is so violent in this movie, but he always has a smile on his face, poor Jared Leto though, it made me sad that he didn't survive!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|In a class all their own....can't wait to hear more from these guys! A true sing-along CD! First four songs the best.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game! It is sometimes hard to get more money and to pass the games but overall it's great.This is one of my favorite games!
B0095P3ULC|5.0|love it so much some of the movie did not work but they fix the problem keep all the movies coming
B004QSQMKE|5.0|My husband has talked about this movie he loved as a kid for years. So when I saw it, I knew I was buying it! :)<br />It was a good family movie, definitely worth the purchase.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Haven't downloaded a FAOTD for quite a while because the pickings have been pretty lame.  This one is actually fun.
B004LWZW6K|4.0|cheap thrills, transferring piranha from girl to boy was kinda a hoot. the Hof was not up for an Oscar. Now the prehistoric piranha can walk on land, cant wait for the next movie
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Come on, now! Who doesn't love &#34;Home?&#34; Price of the CD was worth this one selection alone! And &#34;Gone. Gone. Gone.&#34; does it for me, too.....love this CD!
B001ANSSDC|2.0|It is a good story but the football part spoils it for me<br /><br />There's just way too much descriptive info about it.
B007REV4YI|4.0|The movie is very well done.  Lots of action, some sly in-jokes and homages to quiet those who thought the series had been stripped of all humor, and the reintroduction of a few classic elements to remind everyone this is still James Bond, not Jason Bourne.  Craig really sells the &#34;aging but still tough&#34; aspect.<br /><br />GoldenEye coyly ASKED whether Bond still mattered in the modern age but then swept the question under the rug.  Skyfall has the moxy to SHOW Bond aging, off his game and out of his element.  It's actually willing to EXPLORE the question of his relevance.  To paraphrase M, the spy isn't less relevant in today's world... in fact, spies are more relevant than ever.<br /><br />Kind of an anti-climactic ending all things considered, but enough twists leading right up to it make up for it, IMO.  Fun movie!
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|&#34;Brave&#34; is wonderful!  I find myself listening to this particular song over and over.  The rest of the album has proven to be a bit of a disappointment to me.  I'm sure this is because I set my sights on something different and this just doesen't meet up with my standards of what a Groban album should be.  I reccommend that you listen to the sample tracts found on Amazon before you buy it.  I own all of Groban's CDs and I am glad I have this one, but I think if I had listened to some of it before making my purchase, I might have settled for choosing tracks for my MP3 player instead.
B0067R0APK|3.0|This is a useful app ....but...it upgraded itself recently and the whole look of the thing looked much much (did I say much) better before the change. Maybe things work better under the hood now. I don't know. But the whole setup looked classier before. So the old adage prevails ....if it isn't broke don't fix it ...at least the looks of it.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|The strongest feelings I can summon up for this is... well, it's entertaining.  It's not a great movie, but it's a funny and silly movie.  Warning-- there may be some parts in this that are inappropriate for children.  I recommend watching it before showing it to your kids.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Love, love, love these guys. I usually only like 2 or 3 songs on a CD, but I love EVERY NOTE these guys play! Loved &#34;Babel&#34; so much that I had to purchase their first CD, &#34;Sigh No More,&#34; as well. Soulful, toe tapping, can't stay in your seat, pierce your heart wonderful, wonderful music!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really like this only problem is size of kindle screen and I prefer xbox but its almost as fun
B0060MYM3S|5.0|While not following the book precisely, the HBO series has certainly captured the essence of GRRM's obsessively loved series.  Peter Dinklage is absolutely riveting as Tyrion and the rest of the cast inhabit their roles well.  The visuals are excellent, as always, and the long-awaited Battle of Blackwater did not disappoint.  While the alterations in Dany's storyline seemed unnecessary, the surprise re-appearance of a departed character was more than adequate compensation for the mild frustration with the changes.  Highly recommended.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Great movie. Clint Eastwood is great in everything.<br />This movie is very entertaining. Fun to watch and has some very good hidden messages.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This author is just so good. Her books are captivating. Can't wait to read the next one! Highly recommend this book.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Quick download to my kindle fire. Like taking a step back in time. Smooth controls and motion. Only thing missing is a disco ball and bell bottom trousers. Good way to pass time.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book definitely builds on previous titles, leaving readers ready for lots more. Oh, those poor Starks. They can't seem to get out of their own way.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think its the best temple runyou can run farther without wasting coins the only problem i could find is the price on upgrades
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good books, i would recommend these books for anyone to read. The movie was also very very good. Read them today!
B003M70O5O|5.0|Love the series can't wait to it so just bought it!!!<br />!! HBYB KJBKB JKBJ JBB JBjb jbj jBJB JBj
B009738XXM|4.0|I listen to a pretty diverse selection of music and occasionally that includes pop.  I have to admit I enjoyed this album a lot more than I thought I would.  The two main reasons I bought this album were for tracks like Call Me Maybe and Good Time but it turns out there were a lot more songs I enjoyed on this album.
B00849F82E|5.0|Great book for getting Christians going with their theology. It's challenging for growth and the glory of God. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Just what the realm needs, a king. Or is it two, three, four, five kings? I've lost count. This was a fun read, with lots of twists and turns.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|the game is ok but how do you go off the grid you don't get stuck on a invisible border in the hunger games other than that it was ok I should be scary but its the best slenderman game onxtue market but its crappy
B004XQO90E|5.0|What a great idea for a movie gotta love sci-fi great movie for guys and gals, action romance great story line!!!!!!!!!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|If you like the album and enjoy anime then this is the dvd for you. No really, you should buy it.
B00A2H9LK6|4.0|If you liked the original Silent Hill movie I think you would really enjoy this one.  Of course if you were not a fan of the first you'd do well to stay away from this one.  I personally loved the movies and feel they capture the atmosphere of the games perfectly.  My biggest problem with the disc releases is they have been very light on special features.  It would be nice to have some commentaries or more featurettes on the creature designs.  However this is a very bare bones release even on the Blu-Ray.  Would probably be better to wait for it to drop in price as much as I love to support this franchise.  The movie itself I would give 5 stars to, but with the lack of extras on the disc I can only give this 4 stars.
B0035YTG30|5.0|Both actors are just perfect and you just don't see movies like this anymore!<br />Audrey is funny and sooo royal too!
B0094K1PW4|2.0|Too much taken from other Speilberg movies like E.T.,Goonies, and other movies.Not very original. Alien effects not very original.<br />...
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Sorry...this game was put on my game list replacing the previous game by that name. My granddaughter does not like this one at all. I am unable to get the previous one back. I feel it should be MY choice which version I want.....NOT your choice to upgrade! THUMBS DOWN ON THIS GAME! But she will continue to play it.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I rented this expecting a lighthearted teen flick somewhere between angst and romance, and found something so deep I went in search of the book it's based on. The story had so any more levels than I expected, the acting was excellent. One of the best things I can say about a movie is that I immediately texted my kids to tell them to put this on their lists, and I don't think the movie had ended when I reached for the phone. Such a good movie.
B004NELBPC|2.0|This is usually a great app. Today a motley fool ad pops up and I can't access any articles. Hope this is a temporary glitch
B008G59IKO|5.0|From their recent music Trilogy I really feel Dos is the best album.  While shorter than albums like American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown, it quickly joined those two as my top Green Day albums.  Songs like Lady Cobra and Wow That's Loud are some of their best offerings.  I always prefer Green Days faster beats and Dos probably provides the most fast tracks of any of the Trilogy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story develops in a natural way involving an increasing number of characters and the circumstances of life and the environment of the silo world are gradually revealed while retaining the mystery of the reason for its existence throughout.  There is much to retain one's attention but yet there is a pervasive weariness with the lives of the characters that requires one to put the book down for awhile and reflect on the elements of the narrative.  Only at the end and in subsequent writings one discovers the origin of this existence.  The writing is excellent.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First, my only point of criticism.... I have overlooked this book since it's release because the blurb seemed so pointless. Thank heavens for 5 days of recovery post surgery in which I cave to the popular reviews on Amazon! Please work on the blurbs... Because this story was so beyond anything I've read. And I've read a freaking lot. Heck, I've been through 9 books in the last 5 days. I just can't even begin to relay the journey that this story took me on.<br /><br />I have nothing else but praise for Colleen Hoover! I haven't discovered a story yet of hers which hasn't touched me in a profound way!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put this down.  Well written and truly captivating.  Loved hearing this tale from two very different points of view.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|There are only a few things I'd like to see improved on this charger. It needs a lightening adapter for iPhone 5; it would have been nice if the size was smaller,, and finally it is would be great if it weren't so heavy. The size and weight are important if you want to carry it in your handbag.
B004NOH9LC|2.0|The  first 2/3 of the movie is poorly written and acted as bad as the writing! The last 1/3 of the movie is 3 star. Never have seen Harrison in such a lousy movie.
B009KEN87O|5.0|It's 8 bit, it's space invaders with some galaga, it's addictive.<br />The game has four zones with 9 levels each, and 5 waves per level.<br />That's 180 waves.<br />You can choose between three difficulty levels.<br /><br />The controls are easy: just put your finger on the ship and drag it around. Firing is always automatic.<br /><br />You get several updates that you catch by flying over them while dodging enemy fire.<br />One looks like your ship and is an extra life.<br />Others are double or triple guns, auto aim, rapid fire and what I call wave killer - every enemy on screen is destroyed.<br />The invincibility powerup has the game temporarily 3D though I admit this looks confusing.<br />Collect stars just for the record<br />Progress is autosaved.<br /><br />Fire away old style!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|loved it wish there were more levels, once I play it it was over.....  would give it a 5 if more levels...
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This was recently a FAOTD so I decided to download it since I like match 3 type of games. To my surprise there weren't any annoying special power ups that required any of my $$$.<br /><br />This game makes you think and plan your moves. It was fun as well as frustrating at times.<br /><br />SPOILER: You play for 81 days. The ending was nice. I didn't expect it to end like it did so it was kind of a surprise.<br />So the game doesn't take long to beat. You have to know when to use the different power up hammer and bomb that you can get by making natches of the shapes.<br /><br />TIP: Try to get matches if 4 or more to build up the hammer to a lighting hammer then build it up to a bomb then build it up to a fusion/fire bomb.<br /><br />All the power ups can destroy the ice when used on the ice twice.<br /><br />Hammer Destroys one shape of your choice.<br /><br />Lighting hammer Destroys the same colored shape you choose.<br /><br />Bomb- Blows up some shapes with a little blast radius.<br /><br />Fusion/Fire bomb- Blows up in a area you choose as well as expanding to take out other shapes.<br /><br />Well that's it for my review. Great game Devs and thanks Amazon.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I received it quickly and I love how easy it was to insert my Kindle.  It's been a great protective cover when the Grandchildren are around and using it.  I would highly recommend this to my friends, family and anyone with a Kindle.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|If you like family guy then you will enjoy this movie.  If Seth McFarllan is not your type of humor I would stay away.  The movie will not win any awards but it is good for a laugh.
0385349947|5.0|I want to set the record straight for those who claim that Mrs. Sandberg's advices don't apply to \\"underprivileged\\" women - I consider myself \\"underprivileged\\" and I found this book incredibly relatable and inspiring.    Why do I call myself \\"underprivileged\\":  1. I came to the U.S. when I was 22 years old, speaking broken English.  Today, I still feel that my options are limited because of my English :)  2. I don't have any family connection in the U.S.  When I arrived the U.S. for the 1st time in my life, I didn't have any friends.  3. My parents are no where near the term \\"privileged\\".  They don't have money, power, or connections.  4. I didn't graduate from prestige schools like Harvard - I wish I could.  But I am still proud of my 2 Master's degrees in science.  I earned them through hardworking.  I had to work a full-time day job + a night job + going to school full time so that I could pay for the out-of-state tuition, support my parents and my brother, and keep my legal status    Today, I am a senior manager in IT industry- not nearly as sucessful as Mrs. Sandberg.  But you can see why I relate to her in many ways:  1. Like Mrs. Sandberg and her husband, my husband and I are full-time working parents with 2 young children  2. Like Mrs. Sandberg and her husband, I plan kids' parties and my husband manages family finances.  My husband and I divide our family duties  3. Like Mrs. Sandberg and her husband, my husband and I insist on having dinners with our children everyday and share the favorite part of the day and the worst part of the day - cannot believe they do this too!  4. At work, I always sit at the table - just like her  5. I often feel guilty about not spending more time with my kids or not knowing all the details about my kids' daily lives - Mrs. Sandberg did it, too  6. When at work, I compared myself with working men.  When at home, I compared myself with stay home mothers - just like how Mrs. Sandberg did at one point!  Thanks to my husband who pulled me out of this self-imposed unfair comparision - just like how her husband supported her all along!  7. My kids had head lices and I had to stop working to pick them up from school.  Treating head lice was not fun.  But guess what?  Mrs. Sandberg had to go through that, too!  Head lices don't discriminate against so called \\"privileges\\" after all... :)  8. Maybe I shouldn't admit this publicly...  But yes my kids have slept in school cloth so that we can save 15 precious minutes in the morning.  My parents couldn't afford PJs when I was a kid.  And trust me, not wearing PJ at night is't the end of the world  9. I cried, once, in front of my male boss.  Such a relife to find out that she cried, too!  10. After my maternity leave, my male boss put me in a shared office with a male co-worker...  I couldn't pump!  I went to HR and told them that I should have the same single office as I had before my leave because my productivity didn't go down just because I had a child!  I got my office back.  And they found a small room for other women workers who don't have single offices to pump.  Didn't Mrs. Sandberg ask for parking spots for preganent women because of her pregnancy? - way to go!  Workplaces should be sensitive to these women issues.  11. At work, I am facing the same exact struggles she has been through.  On top of it, I fear that females who came from other countries are much less represented at the tables...    The list can go on and on...  I found myself in every chapter she wrote.  I feel that her advices directly address my insecurity and help me find strength to move on to bigger and better things.    So, Do NOT let those \\"privilege\\" arguments get in your way.  Do read this book and allow yourself be inspired by her.  And ask ourselves this: If a \\"privileged\\" and highly successful women like her admits that she cannot do it all, why should we, \\"underprivileged\\" women burn ourselves out trying to do it all?  I found this liberating.    The issues Mrs. Sandberg talked about and the advices she gave don't apply to all women.  But they apply to ALL AMBITIONS women.    Mrs. Sandberg helped many women.  I'll try to do the same - I am going to share this book with my junior colleagues just like how Mrs. Sandberg shared this book with all of us.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|If you have no idea what this is used for, you don't need it. But if your looking for the best possible cooling for your CPU, this is the compound you are looking for.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This app is so much fun! It reminded me of playing space invaders from years ago. It was very easy to manage where your spacecraft was going, yet gave me plenty of challenge to advance to the next level. To be honest, I wasn't even going to download it, but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try. I am glad to have this game. The graphics are great. Give it a try, I think others will like this app as much as I have!
B00701QRI6|4.0|FIRST 3 ALBUMS WERE NEVER SURPASSED IN THE BANDS 40 YEAR CAREER. ORIGINAL LINEUP WAS THE BEST. GOOD MUSIC AND NO POLITICS. REMEMBER WHEN YOU COULD LISTEN TO AN LP ALL THE WAY THROUGH? CLASSIC ROCK WITH A LATIN FLAVOR. STANDS UP TO THE TEST OF TIME. FAVORITE TRACK &#34;ANIT GOT NOBODY (THAT I CAN DEPEND ON).
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|My kids really enjoyed the movie. My two year old even sat through the entire movie...Normally she'll just walk away and look for something new to do after 10 minutes. Cute movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a great book.  I may be over 40 but a well written book with a story that tugs at your heart and makes you more closely examine your own life and humanity is good at any age.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Great movie. Funny and entertaining. One small fanboy gripe is more HELMET wearing Thor needed. People will still go see the movie.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Unlike the previous movie, this one starts with more action right away which is reasonable and I didn't really mind it. The story is good and didn't take too long to pick up. It gets really good at the middle and Catwoman proved to be an awesome character in this movie thanks to Anne Hathaway's amazing acting. Bane who is the villain in this movie, is a great villain because of his smart plot to destroy Gotham. This movie is a must watch.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|What's not to love about Rodriguez and his singing.  Was so pleased to find the disc and at a reasonable rate.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|This is my favorite movie, by far! It's not a cheesy surf movie, but a real, in depth movie about surfing and committing to a goal. Jonny Weston does a great job portraying Jay Moriarity. The surfing scenes are astounding. Great, wholesome, action-packed movie!  The blu-ray makes the surfing scenes even more amazing!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read these books because my granddaughters wanted me to because they were reading them at the same time.  I enjoyed them and was able to talk with my granddaughters about what we had read together.  They were very well written.
B0042AGNC8|5.0|now i have all 3 spiderman on bluray greate story good acting very good sound and first rate picture all 3 are great
0440246008|5.0|Child has Reacher doing good while doing things most people would not do.<br />He touches on Reacher having feelings for the woman characters which helps us women enjoy it more.<br />Child likes to give you a good build up of the characters which I like.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I won't consider it is the best James Bond movie but still fun to watch.  Sorry to see M died this way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My sister got me into the series, so I had to get them for myself.  I really enjoy the story, and the ability to read it on my phone makes it easy to get it read when I have time.
B004GJYROG|5.0|We had this on VHS but haven't watched it in years since our VCR broke and we just stuck to DVD. We weren't able to find Space Jam in any stores, so we were very happy when we got it here for $5!!!!  Kids are happy and it plays great.
B009369Z8A|5.0|This was a great movie about the days of prohibition. It was based on a True story of a family from Virginia who made moonshine. Definitely worth watching
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great movie with a little something for everyone. Love the humor and Nathan Fillion goes a great job with this role.
B003AWRM9W|5.0|As always Eastwood is awesome in this movie.<br />My husband has all but one of his movies and this is one actor I enjoy watching with him.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Nice graphics. Music is not my favorite but you have the option to turn it off. Translation to English in how to play is slightly off but not too bad. Overall much better than many kindle games/apps we have tried.
B008I3RARW|1.0|its too simple and not enough racing courses. I would not recommend this app. The app is great though if you like racing short races.
B00BUVPIRS|1.0|After tutorial you fall and die as soon as level loads. Galaxy nexus, fix or refund! Why was this not a tested?
B00AREIAI8|1.0|the appstore will not download to my device keeps locking up have reloaded appstore several times will not work with my android device.  My daughter was very disappointed.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Every song on this album is wonderful! I was amazed by &#34;Home&#34; with it's world music feel. If that one song was so amazing and uplifting, I knew the rest of the album would be worth listening to also. The World From The Side Of The Moon does not disappoint. You can feel the lyrics and the music. Philip Phillips has this amazing raw, graveling, sweet tune and this album grabs you, pulls you in and from beginning to end you are captivated.
0440246016|5.0|I am almost finished with this book as always Child makes it hard to put down.<br />I try to figure out who the bad guy is in the story but I am not sure yet.<br />Reacher has a way of figuring out what is happening by thinking things through like we should do in real life.<br />Can't wait to start the next book.
B001NLKWLW|3.0|I loved another book from this author (The Secret Keeper), but this one fell a little flat because it relied so heavily on the same formula:  that is, we're introduced to a mystery, which is resolved over the course of the novel by uncovering letters, journals, memories from the past.<br /><br />This is one way to tell a story and it works great once, but not so much with every new book.  This is an excellent author, and I hope at some point she moves on to another method of story-telling.  She's much better than many of the mystery authors I've read.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I love the look and the feel of the case. It is easy to grip and to carry. I also like that it also fits nicely in my bag.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Makes it so easy to finally read this without putting it down and not picking it up again can do any time anywhere
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This movie is a joy we have watched it multiple times already. The HD quality is wonderful and download time was really good. I was impressed
B00A85EMVK|1.0|I recommend no one should purchase this 3d version it really sucks ,poor resolution not worth it. It ashame on such a great movie on original format, do not waste your money
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fun and addictive. This is a great old fashioned 80's style game clone. Fun, entertaining, and addictive, I can't put this game down!
B005ZB91KY|1.0|this prime needs to get its HD up to par, movie was ok nothing special would only recommend to see so avengers makes sense
B009KEN87O|5.0|Voxel Invaders is Space Invaders for the 21st century: polished; a creative spin on a proven game concept; intuitive; challenging yet rewarding. Well done, Noctua Software. I will be looking for more of your apps.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love the thing because I never have to worry about running out of juice for my headset. BUY IT!
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Loved it, it was chock full of shocks and surprises. I was very disappointed that there was only three discs to the season, but it was worth the wait, and I got a great price on it as well! Very happy with purchase!
B0058W74UY|1.0|Uninstalled it. Couldn't get it to work. Think many free apps are pretty useless and just wanted to watch a couple of shows on my kindle for free.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|My Granddaughter and I enjoy playing this when we get together and like it a lot It's a game we both enjoy
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I couldn't stop playing. graphics are very good. music is pretty cool and so is the ghost Anna!!  Only free version isn't long enough.
B005HCI72O|5.0|As part of the outlander series I wanted it to keep for ever. Once you read the first one you are hooked
B0045XICB2|2.0|I don't really watch things like this so I don't know how to rate this movie. It Is being bought as a gift for my daughter
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is a good program for Solitaire. However, it has some kinks that need to be worked out. The best part is it is free but when you run out of plays you get stuck and cannot do anything more with the game until you reload it.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I do not like scary games, or movement games.  So i did not purchase this for myself... But my husband enjoyed it.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like this game because I like chess even though I am not very good at it. I play with friends that I knew when I was younger. This is a fun app. People who know how to play chess would like this app.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game was easy to navigate fun to play very addicting. I think kids and adults would like it a lot.  Thank you for the app.
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|Loved the book when I first read it in paperback and now collecting the whole series on kindle.Hooked on the series
B009KEN87O|5.0|Make sure you play through the entire game on easy or any other difficulty at least once, because some of the later levels will make you laugh, cry and weep for joy at all the gaming memories it brings back. I just watched Wreck It Ralph and that plus this game really makes me want to go back and play my old systems.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|OI like it , not original but entertaining. I like it.  It reminds of Hill street blues except this is more raw.
B00942X8PY|4.0|I thought I would just &#34;try&#34; this game.  It is super addictive. Easy to understand, and fun to figure out all the different levels and patterns.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|wonderful disc set, highly recommend if your a married with children fan.packing was so, so, but i have not had one bad disc yet. highly recommend this wonderful show,
B00005JLSE|5.0|I watch this at least once a month and listen to the soundtrack even more recently.  The acting and the visuals are great. Love the music and Taye Diggs is great eye candy. ;-)
B007REV4T8|5.0|An awesome continuation to the James Bond Series of DVD's and now that we have the full collection, we will be watching them over and over on those rainy days.<br /><br />Action packed, humor-filled as keeping in form for James Bond, and fun!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a total pageturner and I could not  put it down. Just when you think  you've figured it all out there's a new surprise or game changer.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This move tells the story of a person who was brave and did what he believed he had to do.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Best time clock ever made for the Kindle!!! Now it's the best clock ever made for cool display lights and large numbers!!!
B00AHHODH2|2.0|Possibly this book should have been about five books. It started one way, then went another, and another until I was thoroughally confused.
1594744769|4.0|I give this book 3.5 stars. The beginning started off very strong. The pictures really enhanced the story as some of the bizarre things described are hard to imagine.  I liked the fantasy aspect of it and the descriptions of the family dynamic. It's hard to maintain that the main character is a teenager - the way he speaks and some of the things he does and doesn't know aren't consistent with the age group.<br /><br />When the end came, I was left hanging off a cliff. Then I came back here and realized that this was all a set up for a sequel?!?!?!  The story went from great to I-hope-this-gets-made-into-a-movie-soon...I hate that. :(  I'll probably read the sequel just to see how it ends up, but I'll know not to expect as much.
0679722610|5.0|Great book, great author.  I could not put this book down.  Literally.  I would go to bed around 10pm and read a little before I fell asleep and the next thing I know it is 3 or 4am.  The only good thing was it wasn't a tremendously long book so I was finished reading it after 2 nights.  Hahaha.  Who knows how much sleep I could have lost if it was longer.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am completely addicted-waiting patiently for season four-hated them killing off 2 great actors but understand they<br />wanted to move on<br />So far I've watch the complete 3 seasons four times-can't get enough
B00BCOGM78|5.0|This is a jamming album, more along the straight up rock and roll vibe. If you like Clutch, get this album!!! Also, go online and watch the studio &#34;making of&#34; videos they have. Great stuff. Big Frank
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Well enough written but not a sweeping subject and rather depressing even though it ends well.Would not recommend.Thank you,<br />Sallie Brooke
B000P2A256|5.0|A great collection of songs!  I primarily purchased this CD for one or two songs, but I've come to love the entire CD!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has captured not only the events of this time period but brings to life through his characters and the stories of their intersecting lives the difficulties of living through WWII.  The emotional tugs at the heart keep the pages turning.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game is the best game I have ever played in my life.  if I didn't find out about this game when I did I might have died of bordom.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I got a glimpse of this App.  I thought it would either be a colossal flop or extremely good.  It is the latter.  The retro feel brings back nostalgic memories of games like Space Invaders and Galaga.<br /><br />One very nice option with this game is that you can set the difficulty level to \\"Easy, Normal or Hard.\\"  I really like this because that way the little ones in your life can play without being immediately frustrated.<br /><br />In this game you automatically fire continuously. I have never been super coordinated, so this a plus for me. Also, your spaceship is not confined to the the bottom of the playing field. You can move virtually anywhere. Overall, I like the feel of this game.<br /><br />With a nod to video game programming jargon, the price of 1.28 is clever. I don't think you will be disappointed with this game. It's simple but fun.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Purchased on amazon. Following purchase and checkout it was stated that my game would be in my cloud apps on my kindle fire. It is not...went to apps store and tried to download there...and all I get is notice that I already own this game. Searched my kindle...the game is nowhere to be found. Paid for it but don't have it. would like this fixed.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I have been a HUGE fan of Sherlock Holmes for years, and came to know Sherlock as a British, &#34;stiff upper lip&#34; type of eccentric with Watson as the balancing influence in Conan Doyle's series. The Jonny Lee Miller/Lucy Liu combination, in comparison, is extremely fun to watch because Miller's portrayal of Holmes is NOT a &#34;stiff upper lip&#34; type. Poor Dr. Watson, in this case, isn't just admonishing Holmes on occasion to limit his drug use, as in the original material, but invested in his sobriety. And, there's no bumbling Inspector Lestrade. Aidan Quinn plays the model of police professionalism and capability as Captain Gregson. It's fun, funny, fantastical, (nearly) believable, and even delivers several easter eggs by pulling material from Conan Doyle's original Sherlock Holmes stories.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a good game.  Hasn't outright asked for me to buy anything yet using actual cash.  Looks as though there are tons of different buildings and whatnot you can put up in your city.  Graphics a little old but nothing to complain about.  Overall so far has been a pleasant gaming experience.  Although it did take me some time to figure out where to find the upgrade prices... just hold on the upgrade arrow and everything you need to know is right there.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was having issues with Pinterest going directly through the web browser on my Kindle Fire but once I downloaded this App, I was pinning like a crazy lady! :)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I do not read much.  In fact, I bought this book because I wanted to read something on my iPad.  I can say that this was truly a fun book, the whole way through.  It has a good humor to it, yet seems honest and truthful-like you're listening to a real person's story.  I would recommend this book.
B00094ARZ0|4.0|story line not that good but the nude shots of bo derek where great. also get to see some nice nude shot of Olivia d'Abo very pretty girl even though she was real young in this movie.
B00006AW63|1.0|I'm not sure if it was because the DVD was from London.. but it won't play on our DVD player, or any other DVD player we have tried.  It could have been noted before purchase.  Since it was a gift for someone, we don't have any of the packaging information to send it back.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an amazing game!!! I recommend it to anyone who likes to play different games!!  its a blast to play with friends!
B007OWRBJK|3.0|Candid and thorough, perhaps a bit too thorough at times.  I found myself wanting to skim through the parts where Pete goes into a lot of detail about the process behind many of his lesser known works.  Basically editing out many of those parts and concentrating on his self admittedly most enduring experiences and work with The Who and his fascinating personal life and the thought processes behind those legendary songs would have been more than enough.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book to read and gives specific examples on how to show love to your spouse in their love language.
B005721W9O|5.0|Love this family favorite! We love sci-fi, but anyone should think it hilarious, in my humble opinion.  We had to rent it because ours is locked in storage, but we wanted to introduce two college aged guests to it.  They are now fans, of course!
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|CLOUD ATLAS is 172 minutes of extremely underrated filmmaking. It is one of the most demanding films to edit as it juggles six generations over a 500 year period. It deals with new age philosophy of reincarnation as same actors play other characters within the different timelines. It starts off in the 1800's with black slavery to early 1900's with a gay would-be composer. To the present where Halle Berry plays a leftist journalist about to expose the sinister plans of a nuclear power plant and then we have a publisher on the run from criminals as he's ruthless brother has the publisher committed to an oppresive retirement home. It's then off to the furture as a  female pleasure replicant stands up to society and will no longer be subjected to criminal abuse and starts a revolution. The final timeline is in a post-apocalyptic future where savages roam the landscape and rape and murder. There's advance humans living in off-world colonies as one of these advanced female humans, played by Halle Berry, takes Tom Hanks and his surviving daughter; travelling to a far off planet for humanity to start all over again.<br /><br />One of the characters says \\"flashbacks and flashforwards are gimmicks but if one has patience it will be rewarding experience\\"<br /><br />After the first 30 minutes the audience should get into the complex storytelling groove as the three directors and editors make sense of the jigsaw narrative. This is a humanist piece of sci-fi and one looking for another hardcore MATRIX movie from THE WACHOWSKI BROTHERS should look elsewhere.
