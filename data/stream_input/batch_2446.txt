B00785P2QC|4.0|I like it very fun game good way to kill time. not a fan ofnthe constant ask to post to facebook.
B009CV3DY8|5.0|The book “The Time Keeper” is awesome, spiritual in ever since of the word. I just couldn't put it down!!!!!
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Quick and entertaining read.  Great for a trip or somewhere you want something enjoyable to fill a few hours here and there.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|\\"Can't Stop Me Now\\" (one of the tracks) would have been also a great title for this great production. Rod has been on business for... how long? fifty years? It seems that, after a long time working with someone else material (actually, a very much long time), he is now back on track with is own writing and nothing can stop him. That is absolutely great news for Rod's fans around the globe and for any person that is able to recognize talented people. You could like an artist or not, like his job or not, but is not easy to deny the talent. And Rod is full of it. Thanks, Rod, for sharing it again with us!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game, love it! So addictive, it's hard to stop playing. My 5 year old loves it too and is better at it than me.
B002O3Z50G|4.0|But movie's are definitly a &#34;personal like/dislike&#34; - so my review of the film has many &#34;interpretations. The price & the packaging were very good though.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|I bought it because it won the academy awards for best picture. It was a good movie and I enjoyed it
B009UZLRJE|5.0|this is absolutely one of my favorite shows of all time. It's got great humor and a wide variety of characters said just keep you smiling laughing the whole time.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I bought this DVD because my grandchildren kept telling me they wanted to see it. They read the book . I was totally surprised that I enjoyed this story also.  Excellent movie
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good book. Liked some of his others better, but worth reading.<br /><br />Recommend to take the time to read it too.
034580404X|5.0|This set was a gift for a friend but I already had and read my set and they were great!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have played this game before but as soon as I got my. Kindle Fire I thought to myself that I needed to get this game again. so addicting!
0743442539|2.0|I decided to give this one a try because I'd never read anything by Le Carre, but had been impressed by his reputation. However, this book failed, simply because Le Carre beat the reader over the head with his relentless bleakness and cynicism. \\"Everything stinks!\\" OK, got it, thanks!<br /> It's very hard to care for characters who don't care about anything. This book hasn't discouraged me from trying a George Smiley novel(one in which he actually has a reason to appear!); and at least I can rest assured that I've seen the last of Leamas and Liz!
0525478817|5.0|Beautiful book. Great writing. Great characters. Some necessary comic relief. The whole book club loved it. Please write another book, John Green.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This ap has allowed me to free myself from my kindle fire when I'm out and about.  It is just perfect for reading while in a line or for a<br />Dr. appointment.  I mean you have to have your phone with you anyway.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|It's great until they harass you into buying the full version, it won't even let me continue otherwise. I had to erase. Shame.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|It is easy to use and does not get in the way. I wish it would put the kindle to sleep as so as it is closed as the one I have for the first Kindle I perchaced.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|for so long I have wait if peter Jackson will come out with hobbit journey after LOTR..very good movie and can't wait for the trilogy continues...
B009NY43NY|3.0|I'm glad I've read this series of books and would recommend it to others. However, I think the last two novels have shone that Ms.Harris is tired of Sookie and the vampires, weak convoluted plots that bent and twisted to make sure things ended on  the right side. But I'm glad I took the ride
193700788X|1.0|I have loved the true blood series since the beginning and I was so looking forward to reading the last book. I was sad to hear that the story was ending but I was hoping for a big send off. I honestly don't have any complaints about who she ended up with, my biggest complaint was that the book seemed thrown together. The events happening in be book didn't seem to be given any forethought. The action parts of the book were glossed over and there didn't seem to be a real main plot. I am so disappointed that the writing just wasn't there.
B009AMANBA|5.0|If the script is true to how politics were in those days..........it hasn't changed that much.  The actor who played Lincoln did an excellent job.  I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.
193700788X|1.0|I was looking forward to the end of the series since the past few books had been going down hill, but I never expected THIS!  I honestly think that the final book should not have been released due to the horrendous story telling in this book.  All I can say is that I hope that the HBOs True Blood series can find redemption for Sookie.  I was upset that the show did not follow the books since the first season, but now the story line may have a chance to redeem itself.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Gets off to a slow start but once Pi is in the boat with the animals, it has your attention.  I enjoyed it much more than expected.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|I loved it ~ This is a great Anniversary Edition in addition to already being a great movie! Go Tootsie Go...
6305428352|5.0|I'm won't tell you what the movie is about because that's what the synopsis is for, what I will tell you is that this is a amazing movie.<br /><br />It is very emotional and might even have you crying by the end. The cast did a great job and I rank this as one of my top favorite movies.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone and hope you enjoy it if you decide to watch it.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|One of the my fav. animated movies in the past few years. Great storyline and funny moments a bit sad but great ending.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|If you loved Donna you will love this collection.  Great upbeat feel. Clarity is fine and songs are many you will know.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I  am thrilled with this CD. I heard most of these songs on a PBS special and wanted the CD. My Husband and I  can dance to it and even do the Rumba or another Latin type  dance. Its great for listening and dreaming. Beautiful romanitc  music!
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|The game itself is very good and I like challenging the scores of my friends, but it is obviously missing a lot of content in the Kindle Fire edition.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I went into this game through Facebook and noticed there is a lot more to it than what we get on our Fires. On the Fire, all you can play is the weekly tournament, but through Facebook you have access to 5 or 6 full levels.<br /><br />Until we get the much needed update to be able to play these on our Fires, then I can't justify giving this more than 3 stars. Frankly, I'm tired of our device always being like a year behind everyone else's.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Not what I expexted from the title but it definitively worths reading. Quick simple-level and interesting reading. I will be following future publications
0790729393|5.0|A great tale of revenge, and friendship in the hood.  A playful prank spirals out of control and changes the lives of four boys forever. Redemption comes eventually in a well spun tale. An all star cast makes this lengthy tale absolutely spellbinding.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|I found this DVD to be great. I am a huge Whitney fan who found myself watching her videos on youtube all the time. So it's such a gift to be able to watch anything I want on my TV at home. The interviews included are also great...............Don't think twice in purchasing it....you'll love it if you love Whitney.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Maleficent is and always will be Disney's greatest villain. I bought this movie just for her scenes. Love this movie!
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book just keeps picking up momentum that reaches a crescendo that totally satiates the reader. The ending may be one of the longest ever,yet you feel so good that you never want it to be over. The first thing that I did upon its' conclusion was to purchase the next book in the series!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game! Keeps me coming back for more!<br />If you love Bingo you'll love this game.<br />I recommend this game
B004T4KQJS|4.0|It is astonishing that we are gathering so much information regarding the universe and there are brilliant minds that are able to provide solutions to this data.  Persons who enjoy astrophysics and the increasing amount of proof supporting Big Bang Theory would really enjoy this read.
0896898288|5.0|Great book and very interesting about a time long past.  The CD makes putting the quilt together easy enough for a beginning quilter.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I would recommend this book to any transplant patients because it hit home for me due to the fact that my daughter is also a transplant patient.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|A good read for casual/modern western reading - a lot like the C.J. Box stories.  Plan to read the whole series.
B009X01D9U|5.0|Love the case and the different options...the color is fantastic.  No complaints.  A bought this one because of the peg style stand.
0783225547|5.0|I just like this movie and i love pierce and linda pluse i like disaster movies so i am very satisfied with the product
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh my gosh this game is so good that it blows my mind!!!!<br />It also gives you free upgrades of the latest location.<br />The subway surfers game is free and is totally COOL!!!!
B009AMANBA|2.0|It was a dvd some might like but i thought it was very boring...I gave it to my friend and she said she thought about he same.
B005DZMP00|5.0|This set of Europe '72 performances by the Grateful Dead are an example of how modern remastering techniques have brought older live performances 'up front' to 'live performance' quality. This set really puts the listener in front row center in the hall where these performances were recorded. I've been to eight Grateful Dead concerts in my lifetime and none had the ambience of this recording! I recommend this to anyone who is interested in the Dead, but I'd also encourage those who want to get acquainted with the Dead to get a copy of the LP 'Vintage Dead' on Sunflower 1001. This is an LP. I'd still recommend this 'Vol. 2' on CD
B008JGSM6G|4.0|fun whenever and great for the kids on long road trips. They make it enjoyable and easy to play. give it a try
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|I give it three stars because there has been a lot of research involved in the writing of this book.<br />I don't it five stars because it tends to be a slow read. Most of the book deals with the war record of Franz Stigler. I would say, about 85% of the book or more. The section involving the encounter between the two aircraft -around halfway through the book- is interesting, but obviously brief. You can say so much about this particular incident before you have said everything there is to be said.<br /><br />But most important than that, what I found rather pedantic (maybe even annoying) is the black-and-white/all-or-nothing attitude of Mr. Makos towards the issue of the German Luftwaffe pilots and their views about the war they were fighting. He begins the book telling the reader how at the beginning of his investigative career he had practically made himself a pledge of never having anything to do with interviewing the Germans, \\"the enemy\\", for his writings about the air war in WW2. From that background, then comes this book, which practically IDEALIZES the German fighter pilots: they all despised \\"the Party\\", they all hated Göring, they all despised the war, everyone fighting only for his own personal reasons (his' was revenge for the loss of his brother killed while serving in a bomber early in the war, and then, getting a Knight's Cross), they knew nothing about what was going on in the concentration camps in Poland, and so on. He goes a long way to make sure the reader gets the idea that there was a clear distinction between the pilots and, say, the Waffen SS ground troops. Almost as if they were practically fighting different wars, for different countries.<br /><br />Perhaps a more nuanced approach to that very delicate issue was in order. At least that is my opinion.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Don't listen to the other people get it works awesome on my kindle try it if you don't like it delete hope I helped u guys:)
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This is quite a good book, although not up to Albom's &#34;Five People You Meet in Heaven&#34; which I loved.
B004YW4L5K|3.0|Meh. Good premise, wonderful imaginative characters, but feel the writer could have done more with it... Sort of anti climactic and too many strange scenes that took away from it.
0385344228|4.0|The reading didn't flow as easily as I thought it would. Sometimes I couldn't find a basis for the progression of the story. It has an interesting way of presenting itself and at times I could not understand the logic of it. Felt it was a bit manipulated. I did read it to the end, which was surprising. Very definite end. The protaganist lawyer did seem to clutter the story somewhat. Difficult format.
0807014273|5.0|Man's Search for Meaning has been on my list of books to read for a long time. When our minister quoted from the book I decided this was the time. Everyone should be reading it. Incredible life story and a message for everyone.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I received the CD in a reasonable amount of time.  It was packaged very nice without worry of damage.  The price was awesome.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|\\"Jack Reacher,\\" based on Lee Child's popular seies of novels, stars Tom Cruise in the title role of a mysterious military investigator who looks into the murder of several civilians by a skilled sharpshooter. Reacher is a loner who solves crimes because he avoids falling into conventional thinking.  Having spent years as an Army cop, he now keeps a low profile, traveling under aliases and operating on instinct.  He knows the law often fails to provide justice, so he dedicates himself to getting that justice.<br /><br />Because Reacher has a photographic memory, it's tough for those he's pursuing to hide.  An occasional remark made days or even years ago remains fresh in his memory.<br /><br />In the novels, Reacher is 6' 4\\", a far cry from Cruise's stature, but his Reacher does an effective job conveying a self-confident swagger and handling himself more than competently when danger encroaches.  Cruise draws upon earlier action flick performances, so the viewer is familiar with the formula.  Under Christopher McQuarrie's direction, the movie offers lots of action, though the middle sags a bit.  Rosamund Pike co-stars as defense attorney and love interest Helen Rodin, David Oyelowo portrays a tough, confident detective, and Werner Herzog is a solid bad guy.<br /><br />The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains commentary by Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie and three behind-the-scenes featurettes.
B003B0D2QU|3.0|haven't finished  this biography yet. must finish it sometime in the next 5yrs. i find it a slow read so far.
B009LFVV6M|4.0|\\"The Notebook Collector's Gift Set,\\", based on the bestselling novel by Nicholas Sparks, is a story of lost chances, growing up, and the power of enduring love.  Two teenagers from opposite sides of the tracks -- country boy Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and 17-year-old heiress Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) -- fall in love during the summer of 1940 in coastal South Carolina but are tragically forced apart.  When they reunite seven years later, their passionate romance is rekindled, forcing one of them to choose between true love and class order.  The film switches back and forth between the present day and 60 years ago.  The aging Noah and Allie are played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands.<br /><br />This romantic drama is soap opera at its emotional, syrupy best, and the four leads are all excellent.  This was Gosling's star-making vehicle, and he convinces as both the young Noah and the more mature version.  Director Nick Cassavetes captures the 40's era nicely with lush cinematography, pictuesque settings, and period music.  The time period also makes the fuss about social class comprehensible.<br /><br />Bonus extras on the deluxe Combo Pack include deleted scenes, commentaries by director Nick Cassavetes and novelist Nicholas Sparks, Rachel McAdams' screen test, four featurettes, postcard set with scenes from the film, vintage leather-style blank journal with gold edging and ribbon marker, and antique golden locket.
B00514HDNW|4.0|This was good but if you're a fan of the Will Smith movie version, this source material is very, very different than how they rewrote for that screenplay.  So be prepared...  still very much worth reading.  It's been a long time but The Omega<br />Man version with Charlton Heston may actually be closer to the book as written.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|\\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" s a comedy/drama in which all cinematic elements come together to form magic.  Bipolar Pat (Bradley Cooper) has just been released from the psych ward where he was sent for beating up a guy.  He returns to his Philadelphia childhood home and parents Pat, Sr. (Robert De Niro) and Dolores (Julie Weaver), determined to win back the wife who left him.<br /><br />The younger Pat struggles with his emotions, which are kept in not-too-reliable check by an assortment of medications.  He meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman with a history of her own.  Tiffany agrees to help Pat win back his former wife if he agrees to be her partner in an upcoming dance competition.<br /><br />Cooper and Lawrence make what might have been a so-so movie shine.  Their on-screen chemistry sparkles and makes their on-again, off-again romantic sparring great fun to watch.  De Niro is excellent as the father who tries to understand his son's manic-depressive illness and support him, while being frustrated whenever Pat, Jr. lapses into moods or  gets himself into fights.  This is De Niro's best role in a long time.  All four principal actors were nominated for Academy Awards.  Lawrence won for Best Actress.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition contains deleted scenes, Q & A highlights, dance rehearsal footage, and making-of featurette.  A DVD edition is also available.
0143122061|2.0|When reading any book one should check the background of the author to determine his or her biases. In the case of Niall Ferguson it is clear from his position as a Senior Research Fellow at the Stanford University Hoover Institute that his perspective is clearly conservative. Hoover Tower on the Stanford campus leans politically to the right farther than the Leaning Tower of Pisa! What is troubling about this book is that Professor Ferguson lets his biases interfere with his judgment and intellect and engages in ad-holmium attacks on Karl Marx whom he calls \\"radical\\", \\"an odious individual\\", \\"an unkempt scrounger\\" and a \\"savage polemicist\\" who on the \\"sole occasion when he applied for a job as a railway clerk was rejected because his handwriting was so atrocious.\\" (page 207). He attacks Marx again on pages 216-217 and later in the book disparages Sigmund Freud.<br /><br />More generally the book is badly written. Professor Ferguson posits six reasons for the superiority of the West (Western Europe, The U.S., Canada and Australia) over the rest of the world starting around 1500. Several other books have been written on this topic with different reasons posited for the differences. Ferguson's six include competition, science, property ownership, medicine, consumption and work. He then proceeds to devote one chapter to each item. Fair enough, but he does it by setting up a series of straw dummies to compare the West to the Rest. For example in chapter one on competition it is China; chapter two (science) it is Islam. By chapter four, which is supposedly about medicine, he has given up even this foolishness and instead dwells on Edmund Burke who predicted the failure of the French Revolution and the events of that period in French history!<br /><br />Each of these ideas has value and should be considered in evaluating this important historical turn, but it will take a more objective and even-handed person to do it. Jared Diamond's books make for a far better read.
B0087ITBT8|4.0|\\"The Guilt Trip \\"  stars Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen as mother and son who set out on a cross-country road trip as awkward entrepreneur Andrew (Rogen) pitches a new cleaning product to wholesalers.  Andrew's plan in taking along his widowed mom, Joyce, is to reunite her with a former young love who's now living in San Francisco.  If they meet and rekindle their long-ago romance, hopefully Joyce will quit focusing all her attention on Andrew and stop her endless henpecking.  Most of the film's gags are based on Andrew's embarrassment at traveling with his overbearing mother.<br /><br />The film is a sweet comedy with Streisand actually working at portraying a real character rather than a caricature.  More subdued than you might expect, she lets the writing do its job and never pushes too hard with the jokes.  Rogen is not his usual bawdy goof.  He elicits empathy as a smart man unable to sell his product or himself.  There's none of the R-rated language and off-color humor associated with his other screen work.  Director Anne Fletcher balances screen time pretty equally between Rogen and Streisand.<br /><br />Blu-ray bonus features include alternate openings and endings, several deleted scenes, gag reel, making-of short, profiles of Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen, and behind-the-scenes featurettes.
1250012570|5.0|The other reviews have covered most of the high and low points of the book, so I'll keep my review brief. As a middle school teacher, I read a lot of YAF. I find myself constantly frustrated and exasperated by the unhealthy, dysfunctional, often abusive relationships portrayed as teen romance (Twilight, I'm looking at YOU). Eleanor and Park don't share a perfect love. Eleanor's family of origin is deeply twisted, leaving her on guard, prickly-- even hostile at times, and painfully self-conscious. Park is not above the pressures of popularity and social climbing. Their relationship develops slowly, in a way that feels natural, with mutual interests and kindness. It's such a refreshing change from the mystical love at first sight between unequal partners that I see in teen literature.<br /><br />Adults who grew up in the 80s, especially those of us with nerdy and punk rock leanings, will smile at the authentic references. I had those mixtapes. I discovered punk rock in my middle of nowhere home just like Eleanor did in hers.<br /><br />The question of sexual behavior is handled deftly and with care. Again, I'm just impressed with how healthily the author expressed this aspect of the characters' relationship, both the joys and the fears. Park steps right up to the line of being just too unbelievable in his sheer goodness, but never crosses over that line.<br /><br />Something else I found in the novel that I enjoyed greatly was the depiction of Park's parents. Middle-aged, in love, conservative and each with their own blind spots and failings-- but ultimately loving, compassionate, and supportive. They know they raised their son right and decide to let him use that good judgment they taught him.<br /><br />A lot of people have commented on the ending, so I'll just say that it rang true to me.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|One of the very best I have ever read. Whole hearted recommendation to all readers. I am eagerly awaiting the second book of this trilogy!
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I hate this retarded app it looks good when I first got this app it was OK. But now it is SOOOOOOO SSSSSSLLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!

B009NY43NY|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with the final episode in Sookies adventures. So many discrepancies to the story line. Massive changes to the characters personalities. Maybe that was really Sookies twin sister?
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Amazing book l absolutely loved it. It kept me on the edge the whole time. This book makes you want to go yay but dang it all at the same time. Cassandra Clare is an amazing author.

1936850028|5.0|I absolutely loved this book it is filled with inspiration, humor and amazing details.  How awesome that the now passed Dave Landgraf will forever be remembered with your personal interview.  I live in the area where the Birkie takes place and have never set foot into a ski boot let alone on a ski but after reading this book I am truly inspired to get out there and give it a try.  Great book!
B0068RHSCW|2.0|Will (Daniel Craig) retires to live in his dream house with his family, but scary things start happening; it turns out the last residents were murdered and now someone is after his wife and kids.<br /><br />On the positive side, Craig does a good job playing something besides 007 and there are a few, mild, bump-in-the-night scares.  Also, he married his co-star, Rachel Weisz.  On the down side, the script is silly, convoluted, and makes the audience feel like dopes in the last scene.<br /><br />As many have stated, the trailer gives the twist away, so don't watch it. The movie is just okay as thrillers go.
1449410243|5.0|This book is just wonderful. The Oatmeal is a great comic creator and i could not put this book down! LOL. And to make things even better it comes with a pull out poster! <3

B005LAIHPE|5.0|I in joye watching this movie it'svery munch. the movie is vey intertaining. i also like the action in it. it's a very good movie.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|The author does a good job of bringing you in to this world.  The idea of a world where love is outlawed was fascinating especially when you realize that it is all types of love, not just romantic love.  It is easy to put yourself in the girl's place and understand why she thinks the way she thinks considering how she was raised.  It was fun to see how her beliefs slowly start to unravel.  It seemed to take longer than you would think possible which really makes you understand how deeply people can be brain-washed by what they are taught.  I can't wait to read the 2nd book.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Thi movie is a very good si-vi. I like the part were the son jumps off the tower. than I also like the part were he gets pouled intnto the game to finde is father.

B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a good game I enjoy the idea that it talks some through the game I enjoy the mini games the research objects and the idea of solving the case.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|This is a really great game, it is obviously a Yahtzee dice game you play with your friends or random people.  it is a very simple a straightforward game and quite a bit of fun that doesn't take hours to play. you can start as many games as you like, some people are casual and it will take days to finish a game which is not a problem for me.  There are many times though I find people who want to complete a game in one sitting and we can be done in a few minutes (5-10).<br /><br />People are being incredible paranoid about this app and giving poor reviews based on permissions and having to \\"sign in\\".  this is an \\"online\\" game you need to sign in so that your real friends can easily find you and request a game, this is easiest with the Facebook option.  the other one people seem to take issue with is that this app want text message control.  there is an option that you can spam all your friends on your contact list (another permission) to try the app and in return the developer will give you some free \\"bonus rolls\\" (allows a 4th roll on your turn). you can also buy bonus rolls via an in app purchase (another permission).  the rest were pretty routine I think.  If you chose to spam people you can use the \\"select all\\" which will text everyone in your contacts and you do not have to pay text fee's (their server sends the text), if you only want certain people you send the texts yourself (SMS charges). The permissions seemed pretty reasonable to me.<br /><br />Problems:<br />there are several ways to cheat in this game and this is unfortunate, but they take a little knowledge of how apps and phones work to figure them out and most don't.  I have played over 3k games and have only seen handful of people I suspected of using any of the exploits. I will not detail any methods here as to not compromise the game further and I have send a detailed email to the developer in the hope they will be able to fix them.<br /><br />The \\"block\\" feature only stops a person from starting agame with you or chatting, you can still get a \\"random\\" game from the \\"offensive person\\" which is annoying.<br /><br />It also seems this paid version is not as nice as the free one, it does remove the adds and pop ups but you are not able to play in the tournaments? you would think the paid app would have all if not more features/options than the free one.<br /><br />the time that someone is forced to forfeit is not consistent some game go on for 10+ days (12 was the longest I have seen) without the person rolling before they get a forfeit and sometimes it is as little as 6 days.  there is nothing on their website that states how long someone has to be inactive before a forfeit.
B000Q31L4U|5.0|very good  movie & very enjoyable. I would order it for a gift for anyone that would want a copy of this movie.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|My favorite secular work, the story is heart breaking while lifting up the soul to new heights.<br />This version cuts some of Hugo's lengthy exposition that is not directly story related. Those parts are good and help the reader<br />better understand the time period, but can be hard to read since they sometimes come in the middle of great parts without<br />progressing the story.  Start with this version, read the unabridged later.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|this was a very good movie. alot different acting & enjoyable. anyone that is a pattinson fan would enjoy this
B005VPRG10|5.0|This is a fun toy that comes with 4 characters and is bigger than I thought it was going to be. It is bigger than the older TIE Fighters. I recommend this to any hardcore Lego Star Wars fan . I gave it 5 stars because it seems like better Lego product than the past products.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This is an amazing game I like to play it whenever I get the chance to. I hope u feel the same way
0810989956|5.0|Great like the others:). My daughter loved it!  We will be purchasing many more!  Can't wait to have them all.
B004478AS4|3.0|Was okay, better than what was expected. Perfect for an English assignment, many important themes and good for essays and book reports.
B009NY43NY|2.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I have to say, I am disappointed in the way Harris approached this book. Compared to her earlier Sookie adventures, this one falls flat.  I never bought into the \\"Claude as bad guy\\" premise given how he was presented in earlier books. The adventure/conflict was tame, and the entire breakup was forced.<br /><br />And while I was generally okay with the lead up to Sookie and Sam, the actions did not support it.  It was too fast and awkward.<br /><br />I love Sookie and Bon Temps (as do so many others), but I would have liked to have seen Harris' full effort as she ended the series.  Her work would be much more satisfying if she would limit her focus to a series at a time, rather than spreading herself so thin.
B001VZY4MS|5.0|This Album is, in my opinion, one of the best, if not the best, Neil has put together since he left the Buffalo Springfield. Funny that it is his first solo album. I believe that Neil is one of the best in the business. We are politically poles apart, but I am first a musician and this album is a great mix with perfect production. I was a huge Buffalo Springfield fan, seeing them when they were just coming out, opening for the Stones in 1966 and specifically remember Neil and Stills. Being a guitarist (although I played professionally as a drummer!) they would be the two for me to watch.

B005DJREJS|5.0|I was bored and I thought why not and was pleasantly surprised. I became hooked on Awkward. Dealing with issues such as bullying, teenage sex and in general high school and the misconceptions of rumors and situations. A hilarious take one the issues however not so much that it doesn't make you think about them.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|This is a great product. It secures your headset as well as charges it all at the same time. Somene is thinking over there..........
0887431453|4.0|My four year old son is not known for his patience and yet, with this workbook, he is all Mr. Serious.  The workbook contains multiple sections:<br /><br />1. Basic Math<br />2. Tracing<br />3. Maze<br />4. Capital Letter writing<br />5. Coloring<br /><br />It's a fun activity book, which lets kids work on a whole variety of topics and opens up their horizons.<br /><br />What I think this book is missing - stickers.  Lots of kids LOVe stickers, especially as a reward.  For example, for each completed page, it would be nice to give them a sticker.  Another good activity:  say, there are pictures of various animals and you have stickers for 2-3.  Kids can do a matching exercise.  A perfect way to practice fine motor skills.
1423136802|5.0|My grandson had read the first 3 books found in his school library, when I saw this set I knew he just had to have it. He has read and reread each one and is eagerly anticipating the next one in the series. Well worth the money spent!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I'm really a newbie at the whole audiophile thing but one thing that I can definitely say is that this lil gem takes my listening experience to a whole....nuva....leva! I had to fiddle around with the eq presets on my classic ipod to find the right balance between the music that I'm currently listening to(James Blake, Jai Paul,hip hop, Isley Bro's, electronic, bassy stuff)but once I did, ooooooh boy! It's built really solidly, operating it is really intuitive and the bang for the buck factor is a no brainer. Unless your thing is trying out 50 different items for the sake of nuance you will not be disappointed.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I liked the rotating feature of the case and the case is a nice material. The only thing I didn't like is the bulkiness.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|My sister just raved about this movie but I could take it or leave it.  So many different characters made it a bit confusing.  I guess the idea was &#34;Everything will be OK in the end and if it isn't OK, then it's not the end&#34;!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Having seen a few episodes on TV, I wanted to see the episodes from the first seasons.  Every one makes me laugh.  The humor is sometimes dry, and you need to really watch with attention to see it.  Would highly recommend this DVD to anyone needing a lift of spirits.

B009NY43NY|1.0|First of all to everyone that thinks that sookie needed to become a vampire to stay with eric that's insane HELLO it was said in the book more than once that vampires don't stay together long and eric said he was fine with not turning sookie into a vampire if she didn't want to be one. Also sookie has killed plenty of vampires/people I think she can handle Freyda.<br />Second sookie said she could never date a guy who's thoughts she could hear and she can hear shifters.<br />Third I loved the books and I have nothing against CH but for gods sakes she made eric such a big part of sookie's life and then he is gone so fast and then sam comes out of no where I would have been fine with sam if she had made him more of a contender from the beginning.<br />I just think that making what seems to me hundreds if not thousands of people fall in love with eric and watch him and sookies relationship grow for so long to just crush it all so quick was really sad.<br />I also think that sookie was portrayed as a strong character all the way until this book because she choose sam because she thought that was whats best for her. That's like saying I'm going pick sam over eric because I rather have a nice life with a guy I think is ok and pop out a few children because that what expected from me. If she was as strong as she was portrayed to be she would be like F*** everyone I'll be with the person I love no matter what obstacles I have to face to get there.
0061537969|5.0|The book is about a racing driver who goes through a horrible divorce and custody battle, all the while trying to make a carrier as a racing driver. It is wonderfully written and Garth Stein is a talented driver as well as writer. His descriptions about driving are 100% accurate and that is SO rare in the literary world! The fact that the story is told through the eyes of his faithful dog is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />Read it! You'll love it.
B005S9ELY4|1.0|The actual movie was good. But be warned, this does not contain a real digital copy that you can use with iTunes. I contacted customer service for Flixster/UltraViolet and they were of no help. I will never purchase another UltraViolet copy. If you want a movie in iTunes, do yourself a favor and just download it directly.
B0049VZ222|5.0|While the makeup is outstanding, this show isn't really about zombies. It is about what regular people will do to survive in a crisis and how quickly society can collapse. Well written with completely believable characters. You'll love it!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have been a fan of james bond films from the beginning.  This is the best one ever. James Bond not as a super agent.  As a man doing his job as best he can.  Yes he is good.  But he does have his weakness.  Makes him more believable.  And the villian Javier does a great job.  Even funny at times.  A very good film.  highly recomended.
B006LSZECO|2.0|i must admit i was intrigued that this was on the best seller list for so long...so i downloaded it onto my kindle and planned to read it while on vacation.  my sister joined me on vacation and when i told her what I was reading it she simply said \\"let me know when you finish\\"...no more, no less...so i 'booked' thru it..and WOW...did I feel cheated by the ending. She said she felt the exact same way...tricked and cheated....nuff said
0385483821|3.0|Expensive book given there are many other options like kindle version. I would recommend people get a Kindle and read more digital books.
B00B1EGP44|5.0|I had never seen this one. It was a blast! Blue ray adds so much detail and I watch it on a Visio 47&#34; 120hz 3D tv. All of them should be made in Real3D not just the original Jurassic Park. Guys if you do 3D, bring alot 'Out of Screen', just sayin...<br />MovieMan
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I liked the movie, but can't say I loved it. Lush scenery and familiar characters, but moved a little slow. Also, the 3D wasn't spectacular and seemed like an afterthought.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Too much violence and sexual violence--that being said--I could not out it down.  Cannot wait for the next book. May read again.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Simply the BEST game there is.  Very addicting.  What makes this game different and better then other games are the \\"prizes\\" within each country.  You get to add teammates,meet new people and have a great time in the process.
0345529057|5.0|Very graphic and alot of adult sexual violence that I wish were toned down.  Now that I let you know that, it is a complicated page-turner.  Very exciting.  I could not put it down.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I was very excited when Graham Nash announced that he was working on Stephen box set. He told everybody that would be longer than Crosby Voyage and Nash Reflections, the others anthologies which I highly recommend. And he was right. Stephen´s music career is huge.....and it´s an excellent 4 disc set, with nice photos and very good notes. Although I am a collector, and that means a very hard customer to keep satisfied, this is an excellent job made by Graham and Joel Bernstein.<br />I am always seeking for gems, trading music worldwide, knowing new people that share my love and emotions about CSN, but I´m more than a fan.....I have to say that they have been part of my life sice 1969. Tremendous Supergroup with all the combinations. They are three together and they are for each other. They came to Argentina last year and surprised me and my whole family that attend the Luna Park show. They were in extraordinary shape, singing as ever, telling new ideas for the world and having fun. I was the man of the signs, saying &#34;We waited 43 years for this&#34;. And they are touring and planning new albums. I think it´s a refreshing time like the seventies.If you love music don´t miss this and the upcoming music of CSN, Crosby, Stills and Nash.
1592537251|5.0|This is a inspiring book showing the art of urban sketchers around the world.  I never get tired of looking  at the unique work of these artists.  I purchased the booked as I have an interest in sketching and keeping a journal as a secondary form of art.  This book is a wonderful guide to the possibilities of urban sketching. My only small complaint is the size of the font used.  I do a lot of my reading on the treadmill or in the car.  The type is small.  Certainly worth buying.

1846556007|4.0|If you've become a Harry Hole fan and enjoy a different type of main character, you should start the series with &#34;The Bat.&#34;  Events are referenced in subsequent novels in the series.  With Nesbo details are important---if one tries for a fast read some will be missed.  As with any &#34;flawed hero&#34; there are joys and frustrations aplenty, but you will find yourself pulling for Harry through his ups and downs.  The women Harry spends time with are not bimbos, but are strong and smart.

B009P13RQY|5.0|This album is amazing. It has become one of my favorites and is always in my weight training rotation as well as on the road.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|A waste if your time if you read it.  Unbelievable characters especially Amy.  Poorly written, dumb ending, so save yourself time by not bothering to read it.  If you are sceptical about my opinion of the book, scroll towards the end of Amazons reviews, where Amazon have conviently put the many one star reviews.<br /><br />I also surmise that the number of reviews (1,500 approx) indicates how many people are angry they wasted their hard earned money on such trash.  Gillian, you should not be proud of this one.

B00C9G22R2|5.0|THIS IS A REVIEW ON THE ORIGINAL CHINESE UNCUT (130 min.) VERSION!<br /><br />It was finally time for the great iconoclastic Hong Kong director to turn to martial arts action in his intense and atmospheric telling of the great grandmaster teacher, Ip man, and he doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Wong Kar-wai brings all the poetic beauty of his earlier masterpiece \\"In the Mood for Love\\" to martial arts action and executes it with a precise rhythmic heightening reminiscent of Sam Peckinpah at his best, while bringing out the sensations of living through the Japanese invasion of China during WWII.  The cast is magnificent, especially Tony Leung as the Ip man and Ziyi Zhang as Gong Er who perfectly embodies a kungfu mistress trying to avenge her father.<br /><br />But the star of the film is Wong Kar-wai who parades before us a non-stop gallery of brilliant images in which virtually every shot is a great painting, and a story wonderfully trumped by a nuanced style that, while all his own, ranks with the finest filmmakers of all time.<br /><br />Anyone who loves how filmmaking can provide insight into the human experience needs to see this work of art by a Hong Kong filmmaker who seems to be showing the rest of the world how great films should be made.

B00BKBCF38|5.0|I honestly feel Ghost have outdone their first album with this release. The songs are catchier, the singer's voice is more atmospheric and unique, and the music is a lot less &#34;bland&#34; than Opus Eponymous was. While Opus was a great album, I didn't get any real impression from it. It was O.K. This album hooked me from the first song and didn't let go until the final track was over. Of all the songs, I'd say my favorites would be Secular Haze, and Per Aspera Ad Inferni. Body and Blood would be my least favorite due to a feeling of repetitiveness but is still a good song. The CD itself came amazingly fast (only took 2 days to be delivered) and I couldn't be more satisfied with this purchase. If I had any problems it would be that the CD came in a sleeve and not a traditional plastic case, but that's more of a nitpick than an actual issue. If you're a fan of Ghost or even a fan of psychedelic/doom rock and can don't have a problem with satanic lyrics, then this album is for you!
0446310786|5.0|I can't possibly add to the other positive reviews regarding this story; I can only share my personal experiences that this story was assigned reading for me in both junior high and high school.  I enjoyed it very much back then, but only recently reread it as an adult.  Now that I read it from an adults point of view, I can see so much more in the story...the lessons learned, the growing pains of the children, the times they grew up in, the local views of the people, etc.  Harper Lee paints a picture with skillful words so that I feel that I am there with the characters in the story.  That I'm experiencing those things right along with them.  It's wonderful!
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|This is the second I bought one for my daughter too.  Nice coz don't have to search in purse when want to use.  Ad don't have to worry about getting damaged when not using.  The case is also great coz u can charge without removing the way it fits in.  This is totally AWESOzmE!
B00B2TUF62|5.0|Since most people have already reviewed the music itself on this thread, I chose to describe the Vinyl packaging itself in this review.  This album is spread over two regular weight vinyl LPs.  Would have liked to see them be pressed on 180 gram vinyl, but oh well.  The vinyl color is black, and the center labels are different colors for each side. This is NOT a gatefold album, and both LPs are housed in the main opening.  It does include a colorful lyric sheet, but does NOT include a high quality download of the album (although the AutoRip from Amazon function takes care of that!).  The sound quality on the vinyls is excellent.  Couldn't hear any distortion and/or glitches with the audio quality at all.  If anything, it sounds even richer and more enhanced than its CD/MP3 counterparts.  Overall, I was very happy with the double vinyl set and feel like it is worth a purchase!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|perfect. I was willing you pay for an app like this. buy free is always better :) Shari like the most about this app are all the versions. excellent.
B001R0O9K4|4.0|Well, I know that I risk an \\"unhelpful\\" mark from anyone who is mad that I don't think this is a 5-star movie, but, the truth is, I love Liam Neeson, I love Julia Roberts, I love Ireland, but this movie didn't click for me so much. Too much of the filming is too much in the dark..., yes, folks, we have been able to light up the night for a long time, and a lot of the in-the-dark shooting was historically imprecise. They had no reason to keep the lights off to beat each other up. Its a filmmakers thing, I guess, even modern mystery stories have the good guy running around with flashlights instead of turning on a light switch.<br />Anyway, politics between the Easter Uprising and the first independence (which didn't come around til 1922, about when Michael Collins was shot) were really confusing. There are a lot of players (just look at the size of the cast of this little film, and they didn't include all the players...) and even scholars of Irish history can get confused by who's who and which of the many little pockets of rebellion (yes, folks, Michael Collins' group was also fighting with other Irish groups) are involved... So, it would be easier to see who's who and who's talking with the lights on. It would also be a little more historically accurate. I haven't read too many accounts of the time which involve punching the wrong guy in the dark. And I don't need to have a filmmaker representing dark times with dark filming.<br />I also found that I needed to explain some backstory to people who were watching the film with me because it wasn't adequately explained in the movie. For one example, DeValero, an American citizen of Irish ancestry, and his positions didn't make good sense to some very bright people who didn't already know that little part of Irish history (no, I don't mean its an insignificant part, but it is only a 7 year period....). I think just a little rewriting could have made it more understandable.<br />Well, I love Liam Neeson and his acting... Julia Roberts' part, the love-interest of Michael Collins, is small, but she's great, even if the accent needed a little more work... Aidan Quinn is archetypical great Irish actor. Ian Hart does intense parts intensely, and is good looking to boot.<br />So... I liked it, okay, didn't love it... I think it could have been done better.Julia Roberts' part, the love-interest of Michael Collins, is small, but she's great, even if the accent needed a little more work...

193700788X|5.0|This book was great.  Pretty much what I expected as the author is closing out the series.  Old friends show up to help Sookie deal with her murder charge.  She's matured since the beginning of the series.  If you've been reading the series all along there really shouldn't be any surprises here.  If you don't want to risk the $'s then dust off your library card and join the waiting list at your local library.

B002I9Z8DK|5.0|I am a fan of most things Star Trek. Honestly the films from the original crew were hit and miss. Fortunately this was one of the films with the original crew that I loved. This film has great writing with some unexpected twists and turns. It has a great ensemble cast which includes Christopher Plummer and Kim Cattrall. Plummer as the villain plays pretty well against Shatner as Captain Kirk.I  I also enjoyed the way it was filmed especially the scene of the attack aboard the Klingon vessel. The attack scene was filmed so well that I had to see it on Blu-ray.<br />This film and The Wrath of Khan are my favorite films of the original cast. I love the Wrath of Khan for pairing William Shatner against Ricardo Montalban. Montalban gives an outstanding performance and makes the film for me.<br />I highly recommend this film on Blu-ray.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and the entire series. After this introduction, I gobbled up the rest of the quintet in the span of MAYBE two weeks. Recommended read!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Addicting fun and lots of action! You won't put this game down. Great for all ages. The graphics and screen quality makes the experience so inviting! Look out for the missiles and you are good to keep going!!
B007FEZQF8|3.0|The grain of salt to take with this review is that I'm familiar with only one other graphic novel. I've watched and enjoyed some of the movie adaptations, so I decided to go back and read Watchmen. I loved that novel besides the ending, so I decided my next experiment would be reading The Walking Dead.<br /><br />Honestly, the writing is kind of bad. It feels like the author would only write about Rick Grimes if he could because every other character is very stock at best or just a prop for Rick at worst. I would expect that a novel that wants to take a \\"Lord of the Flies\\" spin on zombie lit would spend more time exploring realistic grief over the loss of loved ones and society itself, but most of the characters seem to shrug it off like in any B zombie movie. Almost any personality or animation from the characters is between that character and Rick.<br /><br />I don't think the graphic art is bad, but it doesn't have very much shading which leaves it looking pretty flat. I would say it reminds me a lot of a movie storyboard to be used as a rough guide for filmmakers or for zombie concepts for makeup artists.<br /><br />I'm going to give Vol2 the old college try, but at $9 a vol I don't feel even remotely willing to trudge through all of it.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|I played FFVII back in the day and hated it. I gave FFX a shot since I had a new PS2, and I hated it.<br /><br />I couldn't shake the feeling that there was nothing strategic or tactical about those games. I could just click through the attack dialogue and win every time. P4G is completely different, and I'm hooked. If you click through combat on this game, you are going to get punished. You have to test for weaknesses and guard against charge up attacks and use your team mates based on their strengths. It feels completely different to me.<br /><br />On top of that, the story is really interesting to me so far, and there is a HUGE amount of stuff to do from discovering all personas, tending garden, developing your character, developing relationships; it really never ends.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This was fun for the kids to put together. They are looking forward to getting another set to add to it later. It was a cheaper price than most, but have to admit for the little amount of product included, you would expect it to be less expensive. We've been a lego family for years though!

B009NY43NY|2.0|Being the last book in the series I expected fireworks what I got was a bunch of duds. I in no way shape or form saw it ending this way it was so well dull and lacking any real spice. It felt like she was trying to cram so much into one short book that everything was summarized. This did not do the series any justice what's so ever and after reading all the other books I'm left feeling great disappointment.

B0000VCZKW|5.0|My son asked of we could get this movie because he had seen it at school and wanted to watch it more. We all watched it together - it's entertaining and funny - just plain fun. Not much of a plot but definitely a fun family movie.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I love this book. John Locke starts out the book by telling his story ... how he released his first book, then hired an expensive PR firm to promote it, and did everything that other people told him to sell his book ... and nothing. He had dismal sales. Then he devised his own marketing plan. His primary marketing effort was Twitter ... and viola, it worked. John talks about how he built his audience and who are his loyal fans that buy over and over again. In a nutshell, becoming a popular author is a matter of persistence. The book is more than his story, John also imparts many practical tips and advice for authors.
193700788X|1.0|BEWARE SPOILERS<br /><br />For me the HEA is not the issue - ha those of you who know me are like right OY - hahahahaha.  But seriously, I could have lived with a Sam HEA if it had been presented in a better manner or even if Sookie chose Sam.  I probably would have given the book 3 stars too if the message didn't suck so bad.  And that is what really made me mad, the message.  Here were my issues:<br /><br />#1 - the message<br />For years CH has talked about the underlying message in the series being about marginalized people, gay rights, discrimination, blah, blah, blah.  Well, in the end she turns that issue upsidedown and smacked us in the face with it.  Sookie's desire for a simple normal life with humans is painfully clear.  CH tries to reinforce her choice in the HEA by driving the point home over and over that vampires are bad, and not to be trusted.  That the only healthy safe life, is away from them.  From Tara saying we should spit on the vampires to Sookie outing the Were at the clothing store, she turns Sookie into nothing more than a bigot.  Now Sookie has shown signs of this before, but I truly believed given CH message about prejudice blah, blah, blah that she would ultimately make a strong case for the underlying theme in the final book.  This is the main reason I always felt the HEA had to be Eric.<br /><br />Instead the message from DEA is that people should stay with their own kind.  And I find that message to be very sad and shocking.<br /><br />#2 - it is a tragedy<br />I would be okay with the HEA if everyone ended up happy.  In the end, I don't think anyone got what they wanted.  Sookie, wanted Eric to choose her, he didn't.  Eric, got sold into slavery, and another 100 years to boot to keep Sookie safe.  Sam, got Sookie but only because Eric dumped her.  Bill got to roam Sookie's woods forever listening to her have sex with Sam.  Pam and Sookie cannot see each other under penalty of death.  It is just a tragedy all around.  I wanted Sookieto be happy, and maybe she will be now that half the town likes her but still thinks she is crazy, but at least they like her.<br /><br />The real tragedy is the fact Appius wins - oh a not so subtle statement there I think since he is Eric's maker and CH is the Maker - should have seen that coming<br /><br />#3 - the inconsistencies<br />I love it when an author changes canon to suit their needs.  All of the sudden everything that happened before is not relevant and nothing that was said before matters.  Eric and Sookie talked about turning her, and he was fine with not doing so.  Or the fact that Sookie can hear Sam's thoughts and has numerous times, and does so even after this book in IIHAH, but we are told she only gets emotions from him in DEA. Not to mention things like how is Sam going to keep her safe from all the other vampires besides Freyda and FDC - lol FDC - yeah we know how well he honors his deals.  Oh and let's not forget that Sookie is not even sure if it is the CD that is making her feel this way - so a BB isn't okay but a magical fairy CD is?  It is convenient writing, lazy and shows no respect.<br /><br />#4 - the horrible all star revue and alphabet brigade...and food!<br />I could have used less CH worrying about how she was going to fill out her Coda \\"After Dead\\" alphabet brigade by introducing new characters to make up for hard letters like Xavier and a little more time with the important issues of the day like doing a 180 and developing a HEA In 352 pages.  It seemed like everyone had to make a cameo.  I felt like I was reading a who's who of the Sookieverse, some sort of celebrity roast, instead of a novel that had more important issues to resolve.  And it felt like every time a new character was introduced everyone had to eat.  Maybe that is why I always liked the vampire story line so much, they didn't eat and I didn't have to read all those meals getting prepared.<br /><br />#5 - animal sex<br />Ewwwww - psst don't write about animals and sex.  I thought the monkey sex was a little squicky in DR, but seal sex?  It....welll...lets just say when one of the people can actually turn into a seal at any moment you might not want to bring that up.  It definitely gave it an ick factor.<br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />I probably would have given the book 4 stars even if Sam had been the HEA if it showed any semblance of Sookie growing as a character and learning something and getting a happy ending.  In the end she got a maybe, and ended up being a prejudice small town girl who is right back where she started with nothing to show for it but a few scars. I came away not liking any of the major characters, especially Sookie whom I have loved for years. The book is just a sad, sad ending, and it really does feel like CH flipped the majority of her fans the bird.

B001P1MZNI|5.0|This is a nice remaster of a really old performance.  Frank is great, interacting with the crowd, telling jokes, a side of him rarely seen in his CD's.
193700788X|1.0|This book has to be one of the worst books I have read in a long while. The magic and charm of the previous books was nowhere to be found. I actually found it hard to get through most of it, as it felt like very poorly written fan fiction. Most of the characters are out of character as well. They lost their spunk. It was like we were jut going through the process of systematically ruling out suitors, so boring. The plot line was absolutely point less. I cannot fathom how his book was actually allowed to be released. The quality is just not there. Not to mention, I feel like Charlaine Harris threw some of our favourites under the bus for no good apparent reason. Does Charlaine Harris really hate her own characters? I will not be reading another of her books.
0307951529|5.0|Great read.  Down to earth and real stories about those who created and achieved their dream lives.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Mark from TeachtoRun.com
B00APKIN1I|5.0|I bought both this soundtrack and the documentary and this soundtrack goes leaps and bounds beyond the DVD.<br /><br />This CD is timeless/classic.<br /><br />It's almost like a mix-tape that incorporates every single artist and their style of music.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac and that was the only track I can't seem to fall in love with because it's emo.<br /><br />But the rest of the songs here are golden.<br /><br />Word of warning: some tracks are not what you would expect.<br /><br />For example, when I heard Grohl was going to team up with Brad Wilk and Tim Commerford (Rage Against the Machine) I was expecting a Foo Fighter/Rage mash-up, but this didn't happen, not even close. But it was still a good track.<br /><br />Also, the final song; Mantra, that has Reznor (Nine Inch Nails) Homme, (Queens of the Stone Age) and Grohl (Foo Fighters) team-up to deliver a song was having me expecting such a cool-ass colossal mash-up, I thought I would be rocking out hard.... but the song was more-so a mellow kick-ass rock song, completely not expected.<br /><br />Either way, I have this album on heavy-rotation right now.<br /><br />It's also a great road-trip CD.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Already cannot wait for season 2 to be on dvd. this series is amazing.<br />highly recommend.. just watch one show and you will be hooked like i was.
B00B2YH7D6|3.0|But I don't think this rock-u-mentary was all that great.<br /><br />I love Dave Grohl, so it hurts for me to say this.<br /><br />Then I realized that this wasn't about Grohl at all, but more-so about Sound City. This movie does a great job high-lighting the history of such an awe-inspiring place.<br /><br />I don't agree with the like... 30-minute jam session at the end with (SPOILER ALERT) Paul. I was more interested in knowing more about Sound City. Yes, this session was magical/epic, but I felt like too much time was devoted on this.<br /><br />Don't bite my head off.<br /><br />Again, if there was a documentary dedicated to the jam sessions that occurred here for the soundtrack, then I would be all for it, but this was a movie for a recording studio.<br /><br />I do love me some good ole rock and roll though.
B009CV7IIA|5.0|We listened to this book on a long road trip. Adults and teenagers all loved the intensity, entertainment value and peek into the future this book offered. When we stopped for gas, everyone demanded that we don't start the car until all had arrived back in their seat so they didn't miss a thing. The story is riveting.  The characters, especially Parsival and Artimus are endearing. They are genuine, caring, and the good guys in the story, so you really want them to be successful in their quest.<br />The trip back to the 80's movies, music and video games was extremely fun for us adults.<br />The language was locker room talk in some areas when Parsival is talking to his friend H, which was degrading and frustrating. This certainly could have been left out of the book.<br />Great read and very much enjoyed.

B009NY43NY|4.0|*** Spoilers ***<br /><br />Maybe I'm clairvoyant, but I sort of had it figured from the first book that Sookie would end up with a human - most likely Sam.  When she became a partner in the bar, I was pretty sure I was right and it was just in-your-face obvious after the last book.  I am baffled by the negative reviews of what seems to me to be a perfectly logical conclusion to the series.  Sookie is first and foremost a regular, small-town, Southern girl.  She's HUMAN and she consistently wanted nothing more than to stay that way.  While her exposure to the \\"supes\\" was interesting and fun, I never for a moment thought she would end up with a vampire or leaving Bon Temps.  And I think that Ms. Harris was pretty true to that throughout the series.  There were lots of loose ends to wrap up and perhaps she tried to fit a few too many into this book, but I was satisfied with the end of this far-fetched fantasy series.

B00AU15HPC|3.0|I always have enjoyed Hayward and the Moody Blues.  This album is a snoozer.  A bit disappointing- not many songs that are memorable.
B009POCG0Y|3.0|A young drug dealer Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) is in big trouble. He is in debt to a local gangster threatening to kill Chris if he fails to pay back in time. Chris thinks of killing his own mother (who he thinks is responsible for his predicaments) and collecting insurance money, so he contacts Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a police detective who moonshines as a contract killer.<br /><br />As Chris failed to come up with money (cash in advance), Joe only agrees on the condition that he can have Dottie (Juno Temple) Chris' sister as a \\"retainer.\\"<br /><br />So who gets what, and how? As is the case with most of dark crime comedy dramas, the story is not supposed to be taken too seriously. Matthew McConaughey knows what kind of film he is in, playing the larger-than-life role with quiet menace. Characters are largely repulsive and their behaviors often grotesquely exaggerated, but they are supposed to be so. With their fates sealed from the very beginning, we know where these characters are all going.<br /><br />But in what way? This is where \\"Killer Joe\\" disappoints, as they could have given the story a few more twists. The relationship between \\"Killer Joe\\" and Dottie (played by quirkily attractive Juno Temple) that is surprisingly sweet at times could have been developed into something more interesting - something William Friedkin, director of \\"The French Connection\\" and \\"The Exorcist\\" is not interested in.<br /><br />So what we get here is a crime noir with not much of a story, but with some graphic violence and over-the-top performances. This is regrettable because the story and characters, it is clear, have some room for development.

193700788X|3.0|I think this is a very enjoyable series overall. It's entertaining and very easy to read. Honestly, this was a series that could have gone forever, so I'm sure it must have been extremely difficult to come up with an ending. There are so many characters in this series, and although it was nice to see many of them again, it did feel a bit inconsistent in this book. But at the end of the day, Charlaine Harris had a lot of things to address, and while the book was a bit disappointing, the ending was honestly what I expected from the beginning. Of course there are the usual over-the-top bad guys like in the last few books, and it wasn't all that new or exciting. It's clear that the author is ready to move on from these books, and that's definitely her right. I do wish they had just given the series over to ghost writers, though, because this isn't a series that can be neatly ended.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, although it was nothing special in comparison to the rest of the series. I'm moderately pleased with the ending, although I'd rather not see such an entertaining series end. I'm a bit sad to know that Sookie's adventures are over, but I can always read the books again.

193700788X|5.0|I just finished the book, and I feel it was completely true to the Sookie we have seen through the entire series.  I'm very satisfied with how it all wrapped up, and I love that Charlaine Harris managed to keep the world coherent, consistent and believable all the way to the end.  If you've read any of Charlaine's other series from the beginning to the end, this wrap-up is very much in keeping with her writing style.  I absolutely loved it.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Yes, it took me a few listens to like this album.  I think mainley because I am a huge fan of Rush's early album with the clean production, where every instrument is clearly defined and separate.  This album is not produced in that manner.  It's produced in what I would call a \\"modern\\" stlye where there seems to be much more going on, and picking out any one instrument can be difficult. Even Alex's solos can slip by unnoticed if you're not paying careful attention.  But once I got over my dislike of the production, I began to realize what a phenomenal set of songs this was.  For one thing, Rush rocks so hard on this album it's unbelievable.  I missed that Rush in their middle period, and even though they started getting some fire back around Counterparts, it wasn't this intense.  Not by a long shot.<br /><br />And then there is the concept.  What Rush fan is not going to love the idea of a full-album sci-fi/steampunk concept album?  I think part of what made start to like this album more was reading the liner notes in the cd.  I'd made the mistake of trying to figure out the story from the songs.  You can do that with 2112, Hemispheres, and their other early story songs.  You can't with this cd.  The song lyrics don't really tell the story, they comment on what's happening in the protaganist's life. After I read the liner notes the story came together for me.<br /><br />I love that the story ends optimistically.  I think there is a strong parallel between Clockwork Angels and 2112.  You have a young hero, and an all-powerful ruler(s).  The young hero struggles against the rulers.  But there's a difference.  In 2112, the hero dies, and then the calvary arrives.  In CA, the hero gains a victory, but it isn't physical victory, it's a personal one.  He comes to grips with what he believes and how he should live his life.  The last three songs BU2B2, Wish Them Well, and The Garden, are all really commentaries on this new philosophy.  All three are beautiful songs, especially the last two.<br /><br />My recommendation is to buy this cd, read the notes, and spend some time with it.  I think you'll love it like I do.ally the last two.<br /><br />My recommendation is to buy this cd, read the notes, and spend some time with it.  I think you'll love it like I do.

193700788X|1.0|Before I read the book I knew I would be disappointed, due to how the last book ended. I was hoping for at minimum a good story and some kind of believable setup for Sookies love interest. The story was mundane and I skipped through the \\"romance\\" part because it was rushed with no setup. I'm no longer a Sookie fan, she's a become a boring character that never knows what she wants.

B001CQONKY|5.0|What's not to love about CSI? I love having the ability to watch them whenever I want. I miss the old crew.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A tale that will keep you interested through every page. To see the war through the eyes of a German ace was captivating.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I love Bon Jovi and  this album is great as his albums are the best..  Keep it up, as I know u will.  You are the best.
B00866JLEG|5.0|Refreshing to have movie that shows better side of humanity in spite of what's around us. Can watch over and over and feel good.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|The story begins on a high note and maintained the reader interest to the  last in suspense during the entire book
B00947N6UG|5.0|Awesome animation that has great morale messages. Excellent for adults and children and can be watched several times. Magnificent beauty.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I've been a fan of Terry Pratchett for years now.  Irreverent humor that reminds one of the satire of Guliver's Travels (for those that know that was political satire), with a laugh out loud bunch of crazy characters, in a fantastic, could not exist world called Disc World.  These are novels that everyone can love, you'll read, and re-read them over and over again, discovering new twists that will keep you entertained for years.<br />Note- make SURE you read the footnotes!  They are hilarious!
B001MSMULG|3.0|It was fast-paced and kept my attention.  Some unexpected twists at the end.  I'm looking forward to the next book.
157421327X|2.0|As the title says, this book is very basic - and maybe a bit too basic. Still, a good starting-up book.
B008MM9630|4.0|lots of fun but requires use of gems to do some of the quest. easy to play but takes time.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|One of the most interesting and exciting books I've read.  Some of Brandon Sanderson's pre-Mistborne and WoT books took me  a while to get into, but not TWoK

0307346617|5.0|This book came to m super fast, it was a gift for my husband, and it was also in perfect condition. I can't wait to get to read it myself!
0143116371|5.0|I like it very much & I'll buy few more for my friends . The photos are great , I LOVE eccentric & original people & here there are galore ! Love it,love it, love it !
0345472322|5.0|First of all, I have to say that I am not one who is easily drawn to a book about psychology.  When I think of psychology, I think of Pavlov's dog, and though that is interesting enough, it's not really my thing.  But I have to say, I have found Mindset to be truly fascinating.<br /><br />There were so many personal \\"aha! moments\\" as I read through this book, that I could not even begin to count them.  For this reason alone I would highly recommend this book.  The truths of the fixed and growth mindsets have opened my eyes to many questions I have had for a long time in my personal life.  I feel like so many puzzle pieces have come together for me and I see everything clearly now.<br /><br />I even felt compelled to write the author and tell her so!  And I've never done that before.<br /><br />It is one of those books where as you read you see yourself and why you are the way you are (and sometimes the light of that can be blinding and hard to read), and at times you can see others and you finally understand why they are the way they are (and you can have compassion).<br /><br />Throughout Mindset, the author tells us how the fixed and growth mindsets play out in our relationships, parenting, business, and school.  I found the examples and stories to be eye-opening and entertaining at the same time.
B009T8XBBO|1.0|I was so bored by the end of the first level (can I even call it that?) that I uninstalled it halfway through the second. This game might be fun for a really REALLY slow preschooler.
B0001HAISG|5.0|My Granddaughter loved this and took it home with her to show her friends and parents. She has seen most of the movies available so i was happy to have found this old timer to add to the fun when she visited. Joan Ambrose

B001TCHDPS|5.0|Purchased CD after watching Documentary Finding SUgar Man? I believe that is the name.<br />Great documentary, music is an experience in itself
B00821OW8K|4.0|I love this series. The characters are good and so is the story. Some of the 'assumptions' the writers take are dumb. Lots of things are obvious but never addressed or asked of the aliens when the people have the chance. Makes them seem dumb. I do get caught up in the story though and enjoy it. More depth into the aliens character would help. Cant wait for season 3!!!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Saw documentary, fell in love with his story as well as his music. His voice is very soothing,, enjoy listening to it
0393325172|5.0|I loved the movie Master and Commander and started the books timidly, prepared to loathe them.  The fact that I have come to love this series of books says a great deal about O'Brien's writing ability.  I usually dislike \\"war\\" books and the very words \\"naval battle\\" will send me into a coma of boredom.  But the characters, especially of Aubrey and Maturin, just sucked me right in and gave me the energy to plow through the waves of naval and British regency period terminology that do become easier to understand as you go on.  And I was rewarded.  I enjoyed these series of books but I have to say that O'Brien, like Frank Herbert, makes his readers work.  He never condescends, never takes the easy way out. I am an old lady and have read thousands upon thousands of books and I can honestly say O'Brien's Aubrey series are among the best I have ever read.
B003DS3GC0|5.0|This movie is a classic must watch movie with a stellar cast.  It is a gripping drama centered on the ravishes of a cruel world.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This si a GREAT MOVIE, I enjoyed it very much as did my family.Have fun with this movie get some popcorn\
1476734941|4.0|Maybe I should say negative results, because both my weight and my husband's have been going steadily downward in the month since we started this plan. We saw the show on PBS and decided to try the diet. Got the book for menu tips and supplementary info.<br />My rating is an average of five stars for the plan and three for the book. The explanation of the rationale for the plan is excellent, but the book  falls short on the menus and the calorie table is pretty much useless.<br />Do buy the book for the description of the plan and its benefits, but pick up a good food values book (or use a good online site) in addition in order to develop your own custom low-cal fast-day recipes.

B008NA3I30|5.0|This is not for you! This is a great movie that has an amazing soundtrack (that is unfortunately unavailable) . It portrays the ups and downs of steady relationship, and the consequences of messing with that balance.
B000054OTY|5.0|One of Brando's not so talked about but greatest movies...... a classic as far as I'm concerned!!  Great story line and locations.
1616551151|5.0|I look forward to volume TWO! I love DA and I love David Gaider, so this was a no brainer for me. The binding is great, the artwork is so gorgeous and the information is very interesting and entertaining to read. Definitely a must for any Dragon Age fan.

193700788X|3.0|Spoliers!<br />I would have bought this book again and again. It was the ending CH wanted and that's that. I like that she ended up with Sam. That's my opinion. I did have to skip over some stuff. I changed my initial review becuase I was giving it higher stars because I wanted to like it more. So I've lowered my stars. I loved most of the books in this series. I would have loved to see more of Sookie and Sam instead of just part of a chapter. I wish there was more of Eric and Bill in this last book. I might even say I would have given it 2.5 stars but just 2 stars would have been too low, IN MY OPINION. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions.
B000EJ9VV6|5.0|It's been over 7 years since \\"Drum's Not Dead\\" was released, and I still consistently go back to it. Maybe it's nostalgia, but maybe the record is just excellent. It might be inaccessible at first listen, but it definitely grows on you over time. The record, at varying times, goes from haunting to sad to ebullient to hungover. An excellent body of experimental (and slightly psychedelic) music- \\"Drum's Not Dead\\" has proved it has staying power. I fully expect to continue to enjoy it for the next decade as much as I have over the past (near) decade.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|We were looking for a durable, basic, inexpensive case for our Kindle Fire 7&#34;.  This was on sale, so thought we'd try it.  LOVE how it swivels and stands up both ways.  It's a little heavy, but I feel like it will help to protect our Kindle better because of that.  Love the stretchy string on the outside for quick closing.  It's neat how it just comes on when you open it.  Highly recommend.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I'm embarrassingly addicted to this game, along with my sister (her fault), her son, and her fiancee. The only problems with getting it for my kindle is that it generally takes forever to load, I've literally fallen asleep waiting for it to load, and the updates are not consistent with Apple's.<br />It's all over Facebook that their players have giant habitats, yet kindle users are still waiting...<br />It's not Dragonvale's fault, which is why I still give this app 5 stars!
B004K8WPUQ|2.0|I like the sound from this Rode videoMic Pro much better than the sound from the built in5D MKIII mic but the flimsy wire and rubber springs are a huge disappointment. I also bought the extension cable and boom pole and think the cable is way too thin. These things need to be beefed up to stand up to normal use. The previous VideoMic was too fragile also and although it still works, it is now held together with rubber bands and looks too embarassing to use in front of clients. Am assuming I will need to replace these Rode mics soon so please make the Pro version more Pro worthy!
082300659X|5.0|Interfaces very well with a class I am taking on Atelier drawing. Excellent explanations of techniques and theory used in drawing. Teaches the necessary skills needed to do realistic drawings and paintings. A must for every artist and aspiring artist. Make your drawings work.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|it is great looks good and i feel it protects the kindle- i like that is easy to open and close

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne knows how to write a good book I always want to sneak this book when I am not suppose to. I think this is a great series. It gets you to where you can't stop even if you have read this book five times. I can't wait for the rest of the movies so I can see Suzanne Collin's awesomeness.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I have read every Conan Doyle Sherlock story repeatedly, and seen most TV and movie versions.  Love the BBC's new Sherlock but love Elementary even more.  Can't yet find season two at Amazon Prime or elsewhere.  Lucy Liu is surprisingly apt as Watson.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|You really have to you your brain to play this game. It is worth the $$$.  I see some people finished in a few hours. It took me a couple of days. Very addictive.<br /><br />Rickiervt
0446310786|1.0|Great book, I'm not disputing that...<br /><br />My problem is that it is NOT the same version as the one pictured. Why is this an issue? Because I am buying replacement copies for my classroom. The version I was shipped (which has a different cover and different font within) has drastically different page numbers than the version pictured. I hunted around to find the SAME ones. It's very hard for kids (and adults for that matter) to have a vibrant literature discussion when they are trying so hard to find the quote/idea we're talking about because it's on a different page than everyone else's.
0307592731|5.0|This is what my least favorite book, \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\", may have been trying to get at.  Cheryl Strayed is a strong person on a journey of physical, emotional and spiritual discovery much less contrived and self pitying than that other author.  You may not agree with her decisions, but she gives reasons for each, bad or good to us but ultimately what she needed.  Great read.
030758836X|2.0|Lots of talk about this book so I tried it to see if I would recommend it for one of my book clubs.  Not gonna happen.  Two shallow self-absorbed characters who end up deliberately twisted. I was reminded of the movie War of the Roses without the saving grace of good actors.

1400052181|3.0|The book contains a complete statement of the development of cell growth.  It also contains a sad, heartbreaking biography.  The author's presence in the book is irritating.  Not an entertaining read.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|The girls giggle too much. The character of Lydia does not speak clearly when she is at the dinner table after she marries.  The  background sound over powers the actors so you are forever adjusting the volume. Could they have found any more dull and dowdy clothes? The overall film is far more dreary than the other versions. Also, do we need to see so many farm animals? It gives the film an appearance that the Bennet family were poor farm tenents. The scene with the huge pig was ridiculous. This version lacks the elegance of the other two older versions. Based on this version it is difficult to imagine Mr. Darcy ever being interested in Elizabeth. There was nothing noteworthy in the actress portraying Elizabeth.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|A few class mates and I were assigned to read The Maze Runner and a group book by our teacher. I wouldn't have thought that anything that he assigned us would be good until I read this book. If u are a fan of the hunger games, this is one to read. I couldn't  put the book down and I normally don't even like reading but I loved this book! Best book ever!
B0016KJKIG|4.0|Bought it as a replacement for gerber compact sport multitool. It is a bit larger and has additional pockets all over. It is very sturdy compared to the gerber sheath. Do not like the hole in the bottom of the sheath though. It should have been deigned without it. Price is affordable.  The belt loops around the back dont look too strong, time will tell. Very good buy otherwise.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|This movie is really wonderful.  THe subject itself is interesting (Salvador Dali and Garcia Lorca as they were as young men before they were &#34;famous&#34;.  The acting is superb.  I used this in my Spanish classes as well as in my theater arts classes.  The students really liked the movie as well.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I just walked in the door from seeing Iron Man 3 IMAX 3D. Here I sit pre-ordering already.<br />I was surprised to see 1 and 2 star reviews.

I heartily recommend this movie.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never reviewed a book before. Even though I read 3+ novels a week, I never take the time to sit down and review one. That being said, I couldn't NOT write a review on this INCREDIBLE saga.<br /><br />I love post-apocalyptic books. Always have, probably always will. Something about vast wastelands, survival under the harshest conditions, it calls to me. I immediately checked the reviews to see how this was different than all the others. See what real people had to say about the book. OVER 3,500 people gave this book 5 stars! I HAD to give it a chance.<br /><br />Not a single one of them were wrong.<br /><br />The character development was superb. I felt like I was there, thinking what they were thinking, living what they were living. Everything was written descriptively, just enough left to the imagination with enough detail to fill in any blanks. I could not put this book down, read it in almost one sitting.<br /><br />READ THIS BOOK! Hugh Howey is a genius, a literary mastermind, and this book is not to be missed.

B001VEHZZ2|4.0|A bright student from Pakistan finds himself floundering in a post-September 11 world when his intellectual prowess slowly loses traction because of his Muslim faith and brown skin.  Despite the fact that he knows he can find better opportunities for a career in the U.S., the student returns to Pakistan to do what he can for his own country.  Several years later he meets an American and recounts for that American his personal history.  Mohsin Hamid provides readers with this sensitive tale told in an innovative way in The Reluctant Fundamentalist.<br /><br />The book begins as Changez meets an American stranger in the marketplace of Lahore.  Changez begins a casual conversation with the stranger, and slowly he shares his experiences of living in the United States with this new acquaintance.  The two share a cup of tea and then a meal as Changez recounts with great fondness his time in the West.<br /><br />Changez makes the long trek from Lahore, Pakistan, to Princeton, joining some of the academic elite of the United States.  As a top student, he excels at Princeton and finds himself invited for an interview at a top valuation firm to join their company and learn the almost-exclusive trade of appraising the worth of businesses.  A new millennium has begun, and Changez realizes he has entered the golden sector of American society: with a sought-after career and a new girlfriend, nothing seems poised to hold him back.<br /><br />He travels to the Philippines for his first assignment for work and spends a few months there.  The night he prepares to return to the States, he turns on the TV and witnesses the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York.  He has an inkling of the magnanimity of the event as he watches the news unfold:<br /><br />\\"I was caught up in the symbolism of it all, the fact that someone had so visibly brought America to her knees.\\"<br /><br />However, Changez doesn't realize at the moment that his world has changed irrevocably.  And why should he havesuspected so, he muses to the stranger.  After all:<br /><br />\\"I was the product of an American university; I was earning a lucrative American salary; I was infatuated with an American woman.\\"<br /><br />But the world has, indeed, changed, and Changez learns this the minute he returns to the U.S. and must endure extensive questioning at immigration.  His positive experience of America begins a slow spiral into a negative one that contains a hostile subtext.  Clients of his firm begin looking at him differently.  He begins to fear for his family's safety in Pakistan.  And his girlfriend confesses that she cannot let go of a key experience in her past.  Suddenly everything he loved about the West comes to represent the things he no longer wants, and eventually he decides to return to Pakistan and do what he can for his own people.<br /><br />Author Hamid handles the potentially explosive plot in an inventive way.  He uses a combination of first person to relay Changez's portion of the story and second person when Changez addresses the mysterious stranger.  This structure brings the reader right to the table where Changez and the stranger share space, and it allows for the tension and the mystery to build as readers will wonder exactly where Changez's tale will end.  From the conversation Changez sounds like a well-adjusted citizen who remembers his time in America with a great deal of fondness, albeit with some mixed emotions in certain points of his story.  This will lead readers to question the title and understand its full weight on the last page.<br /><br />Readers can make it through the entire book in less than 12 hours, and yet the story will stay with them for several days afterward and demand a second reading soon thereafter.  The Reluctant Fundamentalist presents the challenges many members of the Muslim population surely had to face because of the common factor of their faith with the 9/11 terrorists.  Natives of the Western world will benefit from readingthis book; it presents an insightful examination of this extended conflict of terrorism between the United States and select countries.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Reluctant Fundamentalist not as a way to gain a blind sympathy for one faction or the other in the \\"war on terror\\" but as a way to gain a deeper understanding of the way the September 11 attacks changed life for several sectors of society and culture.
B00846REIS|3.0|Good God, where do I start?  Well I guess it is safe to say that I took my damn time getting to this book!  This was another case of so much hype that I was afraid it was going to not live up to what I needed it to be, so I didn't give it a shot.  My mistake.  There is a third coming in this series (because isn't there always nowadays?) and I figured if I wanted to read it, I would need to read the first two.<br /><br />Gideon....jesus I felt bad for this guy.  To be beautiful, powerful, wealthy, irresistible, and still be that screwed up is beyond sad to me.  I know he was abused, got that, but they don't really talk about it.  What I really did like was his possessiveness of Eva.  There is a certain fragility to Gideon that makes him even more special.  Something that tells you there is more to this man than his money and good looks.<br /><br />Eva and her mother annoyed the living hell out of me.  No joke.  It got to the point where I was hoping Gideon would go for someone else like Maggie or Corrine.  Seriously she is so winey and more than a little self involved.  Yes I get she wants her independence and hates people infringing on that.  I completely understand.  But come on now, there is more to life than how everything affects you.  Jesus.<br /><br />I don't understand how two people this messed up from their pasts can make a serious go of this relationship.  Maybe that will become more clear in the next book.  Because honestly there isn't one person in this novel that isn't seriously damaged.  Cary, Eva's bestie. is a complete hot mess.  Maggie and Corrine are both in love with Gideon who basically sees right through them.  Gideon's whole family seems dysfunctional.  And Eva's mom & stepdad are ridiculously overprotective and manipulative.  It's just a mess all around.<br /><br />The core love story is beautiful.  It really is.  But I can't help thinking that I hope the second book is better...<br /><br />I give it 3.5 lipsticks...<br /><br />You can see all my reviews at [...]my reviews at [...]

0385344228|5.0|Sometimes I feel like a broken record on these things. I read a good book and tend to say the same things over and over. Yes, I am fully aware that I tout characters, plot, and writing over and over. And yes, I probably use words like \\"interesting\\" and \\"amazing\\" far too often. But then I read a book that bowls me over and throws new words in my head. So I'm thinking stuff like \\"snakey plot\\" and \\"holy bananas\\" and \\"bazooka bubble gum\\" and I need a minute to collect my thoughts because that. was. AWESOME!<br /><br />For starters, William Landay creates some of the most complex characters I've read about in a long time. And not dumb complex, but totally believable. The flawed end up being perfect and the perfect end up being flawed. Strangely enough, it wasn't the relationships that I drooled over as usual, but the actual characters themselves. Individually (and together, for that matter), these people were just magnificent.<br /><br />But the thing that differentiated this novel from other crime fiction were the little snippets of information that would reveal part of the plot in the future. As much as I enjoyed reading the story (and obviously learning more about those characters), it was these small clues that made it almost impossible to put down the book. I knew something was up the whole time - there had to be answers to questions that were left behind! And through some sort of witch magic, Landay brings out the hidden puzzle piece (You know the one that somehow turns up unexpectedly in your sister's left shoe?) and we're left with a most pristine explanation - and a complete picture of lunacy.<br /><br />\\"Damage hardens us all. It will harden you too when it finds you - and it will find you.\\" SO GOOOOD!!

B009NY43NY|1.0|****SPOILER ALERT***** I have always been a hardcore fan of the Sookieverse novels....but in this final installment I find myself super upset and majorly disappointed. I will admit that I have been a Sookie and Eric fan, but always had that thought in the back of my head that she would not end up with the one I thought was best for her based on how  things were building up. I started getting worried after the last book and half of the one before it. Anyway, I can see her choosing her best friend, but it just seems wrong and forced. Reading the book was not fun or exciting for me, all of the main vampire characters took a backseat which was weird after them playing such pivotal roles in all of the other books. I really do not have the right words to express my feelings and its weird because this is just a book, but the series meant so much more to me...like knowing real people and standing by watching things unfold in ways that should have been different. But alas, I am not the author and I just wish this book would have ended in a totally different fashion; not just for Sookie but espically for Eric...I think he at least deserved something way better.

B0064CJNHE|5.0|A Passage to India is one of the great novels of the 20th Century.  E.M. Forster skillfully draws a portrait of the colonial period in India before the first world war.  The Anglo-Indians who occupy the country live separately and retain as many of their British ways as  possible.  What's more, they have little respect for the native population and treat them as inferiors.  There are, therefore, 2 separate and unequal Indias: that of the Anglo Indians and that of  the natives.  The situation is unsustainable and potentially volatile. But change will be a long time in coming. Forster provides a wonderful satire of his own countrymen as they blithely go about their British ways. Against this background he tells a story. It's a simple story and does not have many twists and turns.  Two English women visit Chandrapore. One is the mother of the city magistrate  and the other is a younger woman thought to be a good match for the magistrate, who is single.  Adela and Mrs. Moore are determined to see the real India.  A local doctor, Dr. Aziz, obliges them and arranges a trip to the Marabar caves.  Something mysterious and terrifying happens to Adela when she is in one of the caves alone. The incident erupts into a cause celebre and ends in a trial accusing Dr. Aziz of sexual assault.  All of the prejudices and fears of both groups of people are revealed and brought to bear on the trial.  To tell his story Forster creates several memorable characters:  Mrs. Moore, whose sympathies lie with Dr. Aziz, Adela, whose response to India is confusion mixed with fear, Dr. Aziz, who prostrates himself in front of the English while quietly despising them,  Dr. Fielding, a non-conformist Englishman who teaches at the local college and, finally, Dr. Goldbol, a Hindu professor at the same college.  All of them play a part in the drama that enfolds following the incident in the caves.  All of their lives are forever changed.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The movie is amazing and in 3D it's just ten times better. And the price for it on here is pretty nice on your wallet too rather than buying in stores.

B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love how creative the writers are.  They take all the stories from your childhood and link them together in some creative fashion. Nice just to see which fairy tale character you forgot about and how they tie into Storybrook.

B00BPWDMP2|3.0|I am just going to write my overall review and not go through track-by-track, at least not at this time.  My initial opinion is that this album feels rushed and incomplete.  The songs feel incomplete and in a flash the album is over before you knew it begun, and without any spine tingling moments! They build towards climax without satisfactory release. Barely a song over 4 minutes, nothing that pushes the limits, everything feels like a safe bet, status quo.<br /><br />In my opinion, ALL FOR LOVE and IT AIN'T PRETTY are the best tracks on the album.  However, they are crazy short.  IT AIN'T PRETTY has potential, but the plot of the song never really develops, one minute she is driving to the bar, the next she is calling a cab and doing the walk of shame. The song builds and climaxes withing two minutes, my girlfriend wouldn't put up w/ that, and neither should we!<br /><br />The vocals and guitar are the strong points. Hillary and Charles' chemistry is nothing short of amazing, as it always is.  The Album would thrive best live...but as a standalone work, I am afraid GOLDEN will quickly get lost among 2013's Brilliant releases such as THE BAND PERRY'S:PIONEER and TIM MCGRAW'S: TWO LANES TO FREEDOM.

B004OZZ624|4.0|{3.5 stars}<br /><br />I was hoping for more in the way of legal drama here, but there is almost nothing on how/why wife Lara is convicted of murder. Most of the earlier portions focus on husband John plotting ways to get her out via alternate methods. This gets interesting in places, and if you enjoy chase scenes, there are plenty of those in this film. THE NEXT THREE DAYS has its share of surprises and uses subtle details very well; however, it also has its share of missing pieces and near-misses (cars speeding through red lights and congested traffic, just barely managing to avoid numerous collisions, etc).<br /><br />THE NEXT THREE DAYS is a remake of the French film, [[ASIN:B002HFWBEE Pour Elle]], and the fact that it's a remake might explain its more uneven qualities. TNTD would be oh-so-much better if we were allowed to know Lara and her motivations just a little bit better--a few quick flashbacks to her relationship with her murdered boss, her family, and the trial would have helped tremendously. I kept thinking, \\"This is a generally good thriller film, but it might work better in short novel format.\\" I almost never listen to directors' commentaries, but the way the directors explained the ending here was very helpful and illuminating.
B00AEBB9EG|5.0|I found it very suspensful and loved that it wasn't grossly violent.  I saw this movie when it came out and wanted to watch it again with my family now that I'm a cynical adult.
0452281881|5.0|I can't begin to explain what this book has done for me. As a copywriter myself, this story made me laugh, cry and want to run away from the ad business screaming. The unusual format hooked me from page one and while it may be a little dated in some spots, I think the same mindset still applies today with a few cultural tweaks here and there. I am currently lending it out to multiple friends in the biz.
1607066017|5.0|I love this comic. It's such a good blend of sci-fi and fantasy, there's really nothing like it. A lot of robot sex, so don't give it to your kids, but its an awesome book for adults with good taste.

B009R659L8|3.0|Compared to all the other books, and I have read them all, this book was poorly written so much so I was disappointed.  The plot was good but I had it figured out long before I was finished. I have always loved her books and normally can't wait for next one. I will try again and hope for the best.
0061128562|3.0|I loved this book when I was a child so I wanted my son to get that same chance now. I searched and searched for a regular sized version of this book or at least a board book version. I'm not sure if I just didn't find it and it really is on Amazon or not. We didn't need the CD and I didn't want the book this small. I thought the book would at least be board style but its not. So my 2 year old cannot look it at alone or he might tear the pages out. He likes me reading it to him but I'd love the regular size much better for comfort of reading.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My favorite book!!<br />I have been waiting to get it on my Kindle<br />For weeks! And now that I have read it, this<br />Book is amazing!!
0399226907|4.0|This is my husband's favorite book from when he was a child so I wanted to get it for our son too. My son is 18 months and really likes this book. He seems to really love when I read, point out, and count the foods the caterpillar has eaten. My only issue is that it's a little short so we end up reading another one after we read this one.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|As a fan of the series, I wanted the DVD, blu-ray and digital copies. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this edition to everyone.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception is one of those movies that you not only love to watch again and again (especially if you are a movie lover), but one of those films that is necessary to watch again to fully understand the concept and the detail. Christopher Nolan is my favorite director for a reason; movies like Inception hit home all the way and keep you interested and spell bound throughout the entire movie. The excellent supporting cast consists of: Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ken Watanabe, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard, and Irish actor and frequent collaborator of Nolan, Cillian Murphy. Spectacular is the word used to describe each and every performance in Inception. Story line is Great and I promise that there is never a dull moment in Inception. Leonardo Dicaprio was fabulous and convincing in his performance as Cobb. Inception not only sparks the imagination to the fullest, but it leaves you in amazement and wonder even when the credits begin to roll. Inception will make you pay closer attention to detail, use your imagination, and is a sort of Asset to the &quot;what is real and what isnt&quot; or &quot;what you see others may not can see&quot; and with these examples, Inception stays on track and never loses its focus. There are those who criticize Nolan for making &quot;extremely long movies&quot; or &quot;movies that are too difficult to understand&quot;. But to be quite honest that criticism is entirely unjust. Nolan has a brilliant mind and vision, and he uses it well each time he makes a movie. So with no second thoughts, I gladly give Inception:<br /><br />5 Stars
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like the movie to be honest, but I am more than satisfied with this product. The movie follows the book closely and I cannot wait for the next installment.
0345803485|5.0|I hate reading.  I never finish reading most books i start.  But this book i liked so much, i finished in a week.  I couldnt put it down.  It turned me on to say the least! and dont listen to the bad reviews, just get lost in the fantasy like i did and enjoy!
B004K4IZ54|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theaters, I was one that had seen the original &#34;Tron&#34; and literally was awaiting when this movie would come out.  Watching it in the theaters and now that I own it on DVD, I really enjoy it, but I do not like that I had to buy this particular DVD because of the combo pack having a Blu-ray DVD in the package.  To me, I do not see a very significant difference between regular DVD and Blu-ray.  So I am very hesitant to buy packages like this one because of what I just mentioned.  I would prefer to see movies on DVD coming out the way I remember them.  When you would buy a 2-Disc version of any movie, you got the movie on  one disc and hopefully, the second disc has special features that go behind the scenes of what went in to make the movie.  This way that I just mentioned that I prefer to see DVDs coming out happens every now and then, but I wish it would happen more.  It is very wishful thinking, but to me that is the way I would buy every DVD if it came out the way I mentioned above.
B007EZJKS2|5.0|Best book I've ever read in my years of reading. My love for unicorns are great. I have dreamed and hoped to see a real live unicorn since I was three but this book has given me more of a understanding for unicorns and has made me see unicorns in a different way. A good way of how they live and thrive in there protected woods that they have been guardians of for centuries.

1594204217|5.0|I found this book to be fascinating. Masterfully blending biology, chemistry, politics, history, health and culture (pun intended) Micheal Pollan bakes an airy loaf of wisdom that's also entertaining. Cooked is about how we humans interact with our food. It's something we all do but unless you're a professional foodie something we seldom think about. I highly recommend this read and especially the audio version read by Pollan.

B00CJVZB5W|5.0|To have an entertainer still performing after 50 YEARS in the business is nearly unheard of.  Rod Stewart has now officially replaced James Brown as the hardest working entertainer of our day!  In the late 1960s Jeff Beck called him Vocalist Extraordinaire! Today, with the release of Time, we can add Song Writer Extraordinaire! The music world has waited for nearly 20 years for the return of one of this worlds most soulful writers of song.  Nearly the entire 1970s gave us such classics as Maggie May, Mandolin Wind, You Wear It Well, Tonight's The Night, The Killing of Georgie and Every Picture Tells a Story!  The 1980s gave us Forever Young, Tonight I'm Your's, Young Turks and My Heart Can't Tell You No.  Even though the 1990s didn't produce a lot of top 10 Rod Stewart songs, there were  real gems to be found on A Spanner in The Works, Vagabond Heart & When We Were The New Boys. The new century started off with Rod giving us his wonderful interpretations of The Great American Song Book, even though after round two, we were longing for some self-penned Rod Stewart releases!<br /><br />So here we have it, and it's TIME!  The album is a true \\"album\\" in every since of the word.  It has a story to tell.  It is of a working class London boy, who longed for the Rhythm and Blues he heard coming from across the pond!  We hear a true story of love lost, one that produced Rod's first of 8 children. We here the story of his dad, Mr. Robert Stewart, who encouraged Rod to follow his dreams.  We have a modern day father, giving advise to his now 8 sons and daughters.  We can hear and even feel a heart bleed, with the pain of divorce!  We have a 67 year old man, who has found something much more valuable than riches, he has now found his true love, along with great joy and peace of mind.  He knows what is important, and has written about it as no other writer could do.  His voice goes straight through your brain and tears directly into your heart!  As the New York Times reviewer says, we have a man here who has a \\"Kindly Heart\\"!  What better compliment could be said of anyone?<br /><br />Those of us who grew up listening to Maggie May, You Wear it Well and The Killing of Georgie, have something to celebrate!  It's the return, not only of one of the most authentic, soulful voices of our era, but of one of Rocks greatest song writers!  As Rod says on the song \\"Live the Life\\", 'Don't forget to let the good times ROLL'!
B00B23O96A|5.0|I still listen to Eric's greatest hits the most but Old Sock is worth a listen. It has a lot of variety.<br />I reviewed this album right after I bought it and have been sorry ever since. It takes several plays to appreciate this wonderful album. There is something for every one here, mature audiences included. The more I play it the more I like it and I am old enough to remember \\"Born to lose\\" from the 1940s. If young people cant appreciate nostalgia that is their loss. Some day they will.
B005FFW46S|1.0|I love Discworld, and I was delighted when Amazon offered this Kindle version for $1.99--although I was also pretty surprised. After I started reading, the explanation became clear. This novel isn't about Discworld at all, although it uses the character names. It seems to take place in the regular-old English countryside. It reads like an Angela Thirkell novel from the 1930s, defending the character and importance of the squire-archy, and their understanding of the proper way to treat servants. I agree with previous Amazon reviewer who felt Lady Sybil is almost unrecognizable. In earlier books, she was definitely a comic version of a certain type of upper class girl who never advanced beyond her time as head girl at Rodean, completely devoted to animals and unconcerned with her appearance. It's easy to imagine her prototype living in colonial Kenya, wearing men's clothing and hanging out with a weird assortment of expat misfits and locals. In Snuff, she is nothing like that. Suddenly she is the chatelaine of a large estate, very concerned with her role in the community of gentry who surround her. She cares about propriety and appearances. Snuff reads like a book written by an old Tory, not by Terry Pratchett. I'm a little disappointed at those who gave extra stars to this book out of affection and loyalty to Sir Terry. Any new reader of his oeuvre who gets hold of this one is unlikely to help keep his books in print in the years to come.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|This movie is genius. My wife and I have watched it several times and still laugh almost all the way through.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked how Greg would get annoyed by his uncle and the ways he tried to get a date for the Valentine's day party it's just a really funny book
B00CBBXOQ8|5.0|So before I start, I want to say that I love this album. It is amazing! It ranges from upbeat songs to a few great ballads, making it a fantastic album. I am slightly disappointed that Olly didn't release either of his first two albums over here in the US, but Right Place Right Time almost made up for both of them. I first discovered Olly when I heard Troublemaker on the radio. It was before it was popular, and I have to admit that I got quite a few strange looks while walking around and singing a song that no one has ever heard. Either way, I predicted that I would get popular, and indeed it did. Not too long after, I was looking around when I discovered Right Place Right Time was being released on the 16th of April. I got excited and downloaded it the day it came out. I loved it and listened to it thrice that night.<br /><br />Now for a for a summary for each of the songs.<br /><br />Army of Two has a very Backstreet Boys vibe to it that I highly enjoy. Also, there are strings in the beginning, which I also like. Heart Skips a Beat is a great song about just letting go. I just wish sometimes that there was a version without Chiddy Bang. Troublemaker is a song that I loved from the start. Yet, once again, I wish there was a version without the rap. Dance With Me Tonight is definitely pretty high on my list, mainly due to the 1960's vibe. It's just really good. Hand on Heart is the album's first ballad, and also one of my favorites. It mixes great vocal and sweet lyrics for an overall amazing song. Hey You Beautiful is flat out awesome, and Right Place Right Time, the namesake of the album, is about being in the right place at the right time and finding the right person. Oh My Goodness can't be put into words for me. Oh My Goodness is my favorite song on the album that explains falling head over heals in love at first sight, a feeling I'm pretty sure that almost every one knows about. Loud and Clear has fantastic vocals and orchestral arrangement. Dear Darlin' is another sweet ballad, and One of These Days explains about finding someone to love some day. What a Buzz is a playful song about a first date, while Cry Your Heart Out is another playful song, yet contrasting with lyrics about getting over someone. The album closes with I Need You Now, one of my favorite songs about yearning for finding someone to settle down with.<br /><br />Overall, I give this album a 10/10. It was definitely a memorable US debut.

B008XKSW7M|2.0|I can't say this is the worst movie I've seen; my wife and I were able to watch it the whole way through, so I gave two stars for it not being so offensive that we couldn't get through it.<br /><br />But it was basically cliché after cliché strung together, with a little bit of plot interspersed here and there. I spent the duration hoping it would get funny, as I had heard that this movie was funny.<br /><br />Sadly, even Chris Rock failed to amuse, presumably because of the poor lines he was given. I am glad, at least, that I got to watch it as part of my Prime membership.

I am definitely going to continue buying from this customer DVDs for my family. It was an original disc, in the original case in great shape and not one scratch!! Thank you!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|While the first book seemed to be endless sex, the second pulls at your imagination with the suspense and added drama. You cannot NoT read the third after this!
B00C3N9J7C|3.0|Meditative Junip is stocked with two great singles, Your life your call, and Line of Fire. Line of fire has the melodic cool flowing sound that Scandinavian bands excel at. The influences here are many, mostly tribal,folk,blues,jazz,pop but they all are \\"just\\" noticeable and don't define the record. Jose Gonzalez's voice is light and airy and lifts the darker textured songs up into some brightness. Some other standouts are the mantra like Walking Lightly and the plodding Baton. Junip is a mellow and smooth listen.

193700788X|1.0|I have never been more disappointed in a series ending book. Ms Harris obviously doesn't know her own characters because she had so many inconsistencies. Did she think we wouldn't notice the changes? I didn't even like Sookie at the end of this book.<br /><br />*******SPOILER********<br />So Sookie ends up with Sam. REALLY? If Harris had this thing planned since the second book, why did she just throw it out? There was no passion in their sex scene either. It sounded a little gross with the seal comment. After all the adventures she ends up in Podunk, Louisiana with the same boring job. Sookie didn't grow, she just settled for second best.<br /><br />Don't get me started on Eric's fate. I cried when I read that he's forced into slavery for 200 years. It makes no sense that he should be stuck with Freyda when he didn't want her and especially when we've been told throughout the series that vamps don't stay together for long and marriages are mere formalities. Why would Freyda want someone who doesn't love her when she is supposedly a beautiful vamp who should be able to get someone who actually wants to be with her? Eric was a bad *ss and now he's just a puppet.<br /><br />The \\"bad guys\\" also made no sense. Where did the devil come from? It's never really explained why CC hates Sookie so much. Because she used the cluvial dor? Huh? And Johan likes to hurt women? What a lot of trouble just to hurt one. How did Claude escape? Doesn't make sense that Niall would let him escape from Fairy land so he could hurt Sookie.<br /><br />The insertion of rotating characters from the previous books was unexplainable. Most added nothing to the story other than to be seen.<br />I feel cheated. Don't buy the book, borrow from the library if you must.

B000008LNS|4.0|I admit that I'm a Toto nut. I've been following them since the early 80's. I have nearly all their albums (just not the Best of albums) and 2 live concerts on DVD. While this is a really good CD, it's not their best work. but it beats a lot of the other stuff that sold as music these days. Even when they change musicians, their work is always top-notch and professional.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Keeping in mind that dear Sookie is a sweet country girl with no real interest in vamp politics I found the end perfect. Fans of the show are all well and good but the books are a whole different creature. She went for real love in the end and came home to her heart. For those of you that started reading after watching the show... well.. I can imagine that you may have made a different choice but this was Sookie's choice. Please give this conclusion to a fantastic series a fair shot and remember what was the real draw when you first took up the series.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I bought this album because several of it songs kept showing up on my Pandora stations. Now I have a new Lindsey Stirling Pandora station. Every track is at least good and most are great. If you like fast paced with a danceable beat, you will not be disappointed. Her violin isn’t accompanying the music it leads and the electronic music accompanies, to help’s by adding body to music.

B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I've never felt the need to rate a movie, until I watched this marital monstrosity flick. Paul Rudd is the ONLY saving grace and he carries this drawn out, uninspiring, dismal attempt at a comedic drama. But if your in the mood for apathetic \\"humor\\" with a side of spiteful angst this might be the movie for you. NOT Knocked Up and NOT worth my hard earned $.

B009H7SCMA|5.0|Not read a book like this before. Now I ask myself, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Hard to say. May need an umpire review. As others have said, Gabriella is a mixture of reality and fantasy. Possibly. If we go with that, I'd say it starts within the realms of reality and rushes headlong into fantasy ... possibly within the first few overs, although the point at which the switch is made may determine how much you enjoy the book. I suspect adolescent teenage boys could suspend reality from cover to cover, but come on Alan, some of it is beyond belief ... you have a pace bowler opening the bowling and he stays in the attack for the duration of the book. Not only that, by the time we reach our crescendo, in every sense, we've lost the second bowler and Jim turns his arm over without even a break for drinks. What Gabriella gets up to in her heroic time at the crease (plus in and around the pavilion) is the stuff of wet dreams. Not my cup of tea, but in the right hand ... a cracking read.

1616202416|4.0|Story Description:<br /><br />Knopf Canada March 26, 2013 Trade Paperback ISBN: 978-0-345-80752-6<br /><br />Fifteen-year-old Kambili's world is circumscribed by the high walls and frangipani trees of her family compound.  Her wealthy Catholic father, under whose shadow Kambili lives, while generous and politically active in the community, is repressive and fanatically religious at home.<br /><br />When Nigeria begins to fall apart under a military coup, Kambili's father sends her and her brother away to stay with their aunt, a University professor, whose house is noisy and full of laughter.  There, Kambili and her brother discover a life and love beyond the confines of their father's authority.  The visit will lift the silence from their world and, in time, give rise to devotion and defiance that reveal themselves in profound and unexpected ways.  This is a book about the promise of freedom, about the blurred lines between childhood and adulthood, between love and hatred, between the old gods and the new.<br /><br />My Review:<br /><br />Fifteen-year-old Kambili's home life began to fall apart when her older brother, seventeen-year-old, Jaja, didn't attend communion at church.  Their father, Eugene was a devoutly religious man.  He was so enraged about his son's dismissal of communion that he threw his heavy missal across the room and smashed the figurines on the table.  Kambili's father was always first to receive communion and the only one of the parishioners to kneel at the altar.<br /><br />Father Benedict had been the priest at their church for seven years now but because he was white, the congregation still referred to him as \\"our new priest.\\"  He often held up Kambili's father, Eugene as an example to other congregants due to his dedication and for speaking out for freedom.  Other Sundays, Father Benedict spoke about, Eugene making the largest donations to St. Vincent de Paul and other organizations, or for paying for the cartons of communion wine and for paying for the new ovens the sisters used to bake the host.  Eugene was dedicated and very rich.<br /><br />Eugene questioned Jaja as to why he missed communion and Jaja said: \\"The wafer gives me bad breath...and the Priest keeps touching my mouth and it nauseates me.\\"  Eugene was enraged and picked up the missal and flung it across the room toward Jaja.<br /><br />Eugene owned a factory that made chocolate wafers, banana wafers, various drinks and other food stuffs and was very successful.  At lunch that afternoon, the family was taste-testing a new drink that tasted like cashews.  Kambili's mother, Beatrice thought it tasted like wine.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it and commented except Jaja.  This made Kambili nervous as she wanted him to say something nice as their father had not yet punished him for missing communion.  She was hoping a positive comment from him might lighten the atmosphere and make her father forget.<br /><br />Beatrice announces to Kambili that she is pregnant and that the baby would be due in October.  Kambili told Jaja and he told Kambili that the two of them would look after the baby and protect it.  Kambili knew he meant protect the baby from their father, a hugely strict and abusive man who was easily angered and expected perfection from everyone in all that they did and encouraged order in everything.<br /><br />During family time the following day, it was announced on the radio that a coup had happened.  Eugene immediately left the room to call his friend, Ade Coker.  He said that \\"coups begat coups\\" then told the kids about the bloody coups of the sixties, which ended up in civil war just after he left Nigeria to study in England.  He said that a coup always began a vicious cycle.  Eugene believed that Nigeria didn't need soldiers but a \\"renewed democracy.\\"<br /><br />Eugene also owned and operated a newspaper and Ade Coker was his editor.  Ade had been arrested and tortured for some of his opinions he wrote in the paper.  After a week, Eugene was finally able to get him out of jail.  Eugene then announced to the family that beginning immediately they were going to publish underground as it was no longer safe for his staff.<br /><br />A few days before Christmas, the family packed up their three cars and headed for their holiday home in Abba town.  The people of the community there adored, Eugene and called him \\"omelora\\" which meant: \\"The One Who Does for the Community.\\"  During their vacation, Eugene's family fed the entire community and sent all the leftovers home with them as well.<br /><br />For the first time in their lives, Kambili and Jaja are going away for five whole days to stay with their Aunty Ifeoma, Eugene's sister and her children.  Kambili and Jaja are excited as they won't have to listen to their strict and religious father or listen to his heavy footsteps on the stairs for almost a week!<br /><br />When the children returned from Aunty Ifeoma's, Eugene literally tortured them because he learned that his own father had been there as well, and Eugene considered him a heathen.  He felt Kambili and Jaja had lied to him because they didn't tell him on the phone that their grandfather was there.<br /><br />Although, Eugene is a religious man and very kind with his money, he is a cruel, ogre as far as I'm concerned.  His cruelty toward Kambili and Jaja and Beatrice is unforgivable.<br /><br />The ending totally shocked me but as sadistic as it sounds, it made me a tad happy.  What am I talking about?  Well, you'll have to read this wonderful story to find out.<br /><br />There is so much more to this story, I couldn't put it down.  Purple Hibiscus definitely gets a thumbs up from me!gene was finally able to get him out of jail.

1476734941|5.0|A great book with menu's to follow.  Easy to understand and go by.  Would purchase this product again to give as gifts.
B0096PS5CA|5.0|The sound quality is top notch, packaging is well done with great materials and a sweet set of extra liner notes, period label reproductions and premium vinyl. Couldn't be more pleased. Plus it's a classic, historic compilation that's incredibly hard to find in its original vinyl pressing so this reissue is totally welcome and appreciated. There are many sequels to Nuggets out there, but this vinyl edition is the original and best - the cream of the crop, and the way it was meant to be heard. Dig it!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I am not an audiophile but I have a business associate who has 13 years of audio quality design and testing who recommended these headphones or &#34;cans&#34; in the $50 to $100 price range.  And he was right.  Previous to his recommendation I had listened to a number of cans and was zeroing in on the Sony MDR-XB500 or Bose AE2.  My son has the Sony MDR-XB500s and they are very nice: around ear, very soft, cushy muffs, great sound but a little too much bass (that is the XB in the model name) but not so much that it is annoying.  I found the Bose AE2s and liked the smaller profile but still around/over the ear (AE=Around Ear) and great sound.  So I ordered both and got them last night.  Well, while both are great cans, the Sony MDR7506s were clearly a little better sounding: the bass was there whereas the Bose were missing the deeper bass.  So unless my wife likes the Bose AE2s, then they will be going back.  For the money ($87 on Amazon), I think these are the best headphones for the money!

0307719774|4.0|I was cleaning my room some time ago and I found my diary from 2005. Keep in mind that I'm now 17 so it's been quite a loooong time. I also wrote in my diary a couple times a year or so until 2009 so I saw my own progression. It was really cute and so I thought I'd try this out. I love the concept of this... the same question asked again every year to see the changes in response. I also really love how cute the book is but I have to say that I hate the fact that there's no bookmark. Also, the book is very stubborn when you're trying to write in it so keep in mind that it might be a little difficult. They give you just a few lines so people like me can't go on and on about absolutely nothing. So far I've only written in it for like a week and a half but I can't wait to see my progress in a year... then 2... then 5!

0307346617|5.0|I read this book in about 3 days.  I doubt the movie will be as good as the book. Now when I go see the movie I will probably be disappointed. Shipping was very fast
B003IDMUT0|5.0|I have read almost all the books by John Grisham - he never disappoints. The person that Rachel become to Nate and her influence in him dealing with his past and addictions have had a lasting impression on me and my life. It's sad as the world is full of the Phelan heirs - I guess we are all driven by something. Their greed does indeed dispel the notion that 'money can buy happiness'. I feel the impact of Rachel's death to Nate and understand how lucky he was to have met her. Wow the priest Phil - an amazing person. It's a very good book which I will undoubtedly read again. It has touched the core and centre of my being. It left my asking what is my purpose in this world and how have I impacted others. What leafy will I leave?

B001FB55H6|5.0|Ah....what can be said about this seminal work, that hasn't been said before. For me, this film is as true as anyone could have gotten to the original novel. The narrative, casting, production and soundtrack are outstanding. If you loved the Watchmen graphic novel, or if you like science fiction, you can't go wrong with this film.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is buggy and slow loading on Kindle FireHD. Crashes  frequently or just won't load at all. Sorting of News Feed does not work. Facebook is really disappointing in its mobile offerings.
B00CFOGCAG|4.0|it is a good choice for u if you like action and running games has customization so you can make  your character
0345529057|5.0|This collection is definitely an interesting read. The author is a skilled story teller and the subject matter is certainly captivating. At around 3500 pages, this collection is a great value at $19.95: that works out to about half a penny per page!
B00957T6X6|5.0|Although George R.R. Martin is no J.R.R. Tolkien, and the story is at times predictable, it is an enjoyable read.
193700788X|1.0|Crap book. Don't buy. Doing a poo then staring at it for hours in loo much more meaningful. And yes, I've read all 13.
193700788X|1.0|Bad:  The book.  While I respect the author's right to make any choices she wants, I hope she respects my right to disagree with them.  Good:  Can't wait to read the fanfic.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This film is quite sophisticated for an animated movie, however, my two-year old granddaughter loves it and watches it all the time as do I.  The main character, a rat who loves to eat and perform gourmet cooking, is appealing to all, and the artists' rendering of Paris is wonderful. There is also the messages that creativity lurks in us all and that teamwork pays off.  This is a super viewing experience!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|My only complaint was that the case was cracked and the inside DVD holder was broken as well. No problem with the discs, however

B0060MYM3S|5.0|by far the best show on TV at the moment (Drama)<br />really makes me wonder why so much crap is on most other channels.....<br />Don´t they get it in Hollywood? We all are waiting for them to do a better job!<br />Then we´re buying and watching.......<br /><br />This is a MUST BUY!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|The Eagles are so different and their sound so individual that I cannot see how anyone who likes music at all would turn away from this album. Well photographed with superior sound and the great songs that only this group delivers.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Recommend this book and its trilogy. Suzanne Collins writes in a way that you don't want to put the book down, not even at the end of any chapter. A great sequel to the first book, highly recommended for young teens and up.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This book is inspiring and very educational on running and eating. It will help me with my training for the Bolder Boulder.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great ending to the trilogy of The Hunger Games. Wishing there were more books in this series, I'm addicted!! But happy with the ending, nonetheless.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I just love this CD! It makes me Happy when I listen to it! It should be part of everyone's collection!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|No better way to end the series. Again, I highly recommend this series to every reader. Suzanne Collins Is amazing!
0345803485|5.0|This is not Great Expectations.  It's not a brilliant book but it's damn fun.  I had every intention of sneering at the story because it's such a pop phenomena.  I had just finished a serious book and wanted something light and silly and I had DLd this a while back out of curiosity.<br /><br />I thought FSOG was going to be BDSM lite wrapped around a silly romance with lots of inaccurate and misguided sadomasochistic sex.<br /><br />Not so. I am finding it a sweet little love story.  And the kink is well done too.  Yes, Ana can be quite annoying with internal dialogues with alter egos and goddesses and much pursing and posturing and biting of lips.  She is prone to gushing and huffing and puffing - but so is he, Christian.  He is constantly devouring her with his smoldering liquid gazes, so the field is pretty level.<br /><br />He pushes her.  She pushes back.  etc etc.<br /><br />What this book is about is two youngsters falling in love. And I liked it.<br /><br />In the real world lately there's a lot of seriously screwy fantasy floating around, passing itself off as a sexy way to \\"have a relationship\\".<br /><br />Power imbalance is not a healthy basis for any sort of relationship but in this crazy world, it's become a very serious and desirable sexual fantasy.<br /><br />However, in real BDSM relationships, there has to be MUCH talk and honesty and give and take where BOTH negotiate what they want  - it might be \\"about\\" dominance and submission, but submissives and dominants negotiate everything.  Nobody orders anyone around who hasn't consented to being \\"ordered around\\".  That's the way it is.<br /><br />What I like so much is this story is about two rather nice people naively exploring who they are, what they want and how each of them can love the other, doing it the way young people will - with lots of blind faith and enviable energy.  Except kink is means they use to find each other - not the end.<br /><br />Yes, they're pretty, he's rich, she's a young adult who starts out a virgin (probably one of about ten in the free world) who is instantly capable of multiple climaxes at the bat of an eye.  He has a perpetual erection for her.<br /><br />In the midst of all this perfection, he buys her expensive gifts and first class plane tickets and they drink the nicest wines, eat well, he has a fabu apartment and she gets an Audi, etc etc.  VERY fluffy - perfect couple with perfect skin in a fantasy scenario in the midst of a complicated love negotiation.<br /><br />To my eyes what makes this very interesting is that it's about the two of them playing with and giving up power to one another while being quite aware they're doing it, both of them are again and again taken by surprise by their emotions and what they're willing to give to one another because they're falling in love, the ante is upped constantly and there are a lot of emotional risks for each.  And in those kinds of details lies the interest as good romances will do.<br /><br />Christian is not \\"THE GREAT DOMINANT\\" (heaven save us from those leather wearing heavyweights) and she's not Anne Rice's \\"Beauty\\" (ditto on that as well), blithely falling, willynilly into all kinds of heavy duty SM scenarios without any adverse emotional residue or physical trauma to invade the endless kinky little fantasy.<br /><br />Every step of Ana's and Christian's negotiating and posturing is considered by the author who apparently knows a lot more about kink than many have given her credit for. And in that I found it convincing in some ways and a good read.  The sex is definitely a bit hard core without being pornographic, at least to me - descriptive but never creepy.<br /><br />I like this book. It's a fast read.  It's sort of a double spaced big typeface novella so there's not a whole lot to it. GREAT BEACH READING - which can be devoured by one's own smoldering eyes in an afternoon.<br /><br />Content wise though, it's far more potent than you might think. He ISN'T all powerful and she isn't a victim.<br /><br />In the end he's a guy (who pushes in very interesting and challenging ways) and she's a girl (who's smart enough to push back just as hard if not harder).<br /><br />I think I'll like the sequels.d she isn't a victim.<br /><br />In the end he's a guy (who pushes in very interesting and challenging ways) and she's a girl (who's smart enough to push back just as hard if not harder).<br /><br />I think I'll like the sequels.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love this book!!!!!! It's truly amazing, I can't wait to buy the next book! BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS IS THE BEST!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I had heard this was going to be terrible, but I didn't believe it. I knew she wasn't going to end up with Eric, fine whatever. But to just destroy his character like that? Totally unnecessary.<br />As soon as I started reading I was like wth? It's like the author totally dropped her previous writing style. Sookie's first person point of views were terrible. She just wasn't the same person. I had reread all the southern vampire mysteries before reading this, so all the characters and plots were quite fresh. Charlain is really terrible at sticking  to her own rules (as we've seen over and over again), but in this book she really let me down with all the characters. Every single one of them, with maybe the exception of Pam who played a very small part.<br />I wish I hadn't read this. I would have been much happier imagining something better for Sookie.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Best game for kindle Fire I have its awesome and I love it but it has some bugs (tiny) but besides that it's awesome
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I just finished watching Season 3 last night. There were a couple of ups and downs in this season compared to Season 1 and 2. But with a plot this complex, it is bound to happen. It sometimes takes a couple of episodes to put the pieces together and the brilliant flashback in the complex character of O'Brien to Season 1 was masterful in understatement. The Handling of the character of Thomas has also been brilliant. But it is true of all of the characters. The worst part is going to be the 1 year wait to get to Season 4. If you have seen Seasons 1 and 2, then it is a no-brainer to get Season 3. If you missed the earlier seasons, get them now and watch all 3 seasons, and then start the long wait for season 4. Get the Blu-Ray version. Definition is brilliant.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|what a great book. very inspiring, and a reminder to us all that we need to place more value on the roles women play in the work force and home
B006LSZECO|4.0|All I can say is.....OMG!! I loved this book. The plot twists and turns were amazing. I could not stop reading.<br />Amy is good....Nick is bad.....Nick is good.....Amy is bad....<br />The narrative from both points of view kept me guessing for half of the book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|walking dead is one of my favorite tv series and this season is maybe the best yet i loved it and didnt want it to end.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE.  IT IS A GREAT SURFING FILM AND SOME OF IT WAS FILMED AT THE BOTTOM OF MY STREET IN SANTA CRUZ.  i SAW THIS MOVIE IN SANTA CRUZ WITH A LOCAL CROWD AND IT GOT A STANDING OVATION.
B00005JKZV|4.0|The movie is very well done.  It holds your attention from start to finish.  The only negative thing I would say is that some of the dialogue is muffled.
B004WJREMW|1.0|Self indulgent over produced mess.  I am a big Beatles/ Wings/ McCartney fan but this recording is as attractive as a dumpster fire.  \\"Coming Up\\" (the Live version) is a good song live, but not on this CD.  \\"Waterfalls\\" is a wimp noodle of a song and \\"Temporary Secretary\\" is headache inducing.  Don't waste your money, as this was the beginning of the end.  Most everything after this was ego driven muck....
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this app is a lot of fun. even so it is a total copy of temple run which I would rate even better.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|We just rented this movie and I was very impressed with the storyline. My wife has read all the Lee Child books and she didn't like the movie because she couldn't get over the fact that Tom Cruise wasn't the same height as the character in the book. I have read the first one and could very easily get over this.<br /><br />When I watch a movie, one of my main requirements will be if the movie is entertaining. This movie was very entertaining. The characters were very believable and I was more impressed by the imperfections that were allowed in the characters rather than how perfect they were.  The women weren't perfect 10s and the men weren't all hunks. They came across as real.<br /><br />Cruse plays this part to perfection. I admire him for his ability to maintain his level of physical fitness for so many years. He is not that much younger than me and I have never seen him less than a perfect specimen. I know he probably has a team of servants to assist him in that and he has to pay for it, but his reward is years of employment as a leading man. His ability to play a character who can master hand to hand combat, which is used in this movie multiple times, is very believable.<br /><br />Robert Duvall rounds out the superstar cast as an old retired gunny running a rifle range. He is great in the movie and its easy to see why he is one of the best character actors in history.<br /><br />Overall a very good movie. Not a family movie mind you, but a good action packed adventure that is going to set Cruise up for for 2 or 3 more sequels to go along with all the other sequels he keeps going like a wizard.<br /><br />In this era of the movie industry, there seems to be a great emphasis on horror movies. I guess they are cheap to make and you get inexpensive actors to play the parts. Movies like Jack Reacher don't come along everyday and I am very happy that this character gets to come to life and give me a couple hours of entertainment.
0689835604|5.0|I am definitely going to buy all of her books. My two year old constantly is looking at this book. He has actually learned some words as well.

B004HO6I4W|5.0|Movie was in perfect condition and the kids loved it! Matter of fact, so did my husband and I. Very funny.
B0097AQEOK|4.0|this was a gift for a long-time fan of the musician that offered up a big piece of the past in a convenient, updated format. personally, i didn't like the thin-paperboard sleeve collection but i did like the tidy box that held them  (i'm in the 33.3-vinyl age group, and mini-copies of original sleeves guarantee that old eyes will squint  . . .  but then i don't have alternative ideas, so there ya go.) it worked as intended as a gift, and the packaging at least wasn't one of those odd-size clunky boxes that don't fit on anybody's cd rack.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My son adores this movie! And, thankfully, we got it to play on our dvd player. We figured out it was the player, not the disc.

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G AMAZING!!!! U can't find a better book any early readers 7-8 year olds will L-O-V-E LOVE this book:)
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|It's not a hard game at all, so it's a good one to play at bedtime. It's quiet, simple, and inoffensive. It's no great shakes either way, but it has a place in the world depending on what you're looking for.
0486448843|4.0|I have always liked his painting style with his use of light. I've have viewed his works<br />in a local museum as part of a large exhibit...fabulous! These postcards are<br />perfect for giving to others whom enjoy his era and it's history.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Hard to follow relationships - fantastic background and period costumes.<br />A &#34;little&#34; racy.  Quite a story but more background would make it a<br />easier to follow.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is AWESOME. It is cute and it is very addicting. It is the best Disney game u could ever get. If u love Nemo, u would absolutely love this game.
B0060MYM3S|3.0|Same as first but a little easier to follow.<br />Looking forward to next Season when issued.<br />Hard to follow relationships between individuals.
B00516G5W0|2.0|He looks pretty awesome I like his stance. I think it was made very solidly but my main concern and it is the only reason he doesnt have 4/5 stars is because from the picture i couldn't tell his green cloths get lighter and darker for no purpose. For the money he was great but if you want a great zoro figure like I did this is not it
B007Y6DUHI|5.0|There is a similar product on the market put together by a couple of doctors and used in their respective practices. They have been very successful with this and have many testimonials to back up The Master Key program. I find this book, what I have read so far, extremely beneficial and supportive of the doctors product, which I use daily.<br />The only issue a person might find with this is that although the thesis is so easily verifiable it may be difficult for some to separate from our usual mind sets and standard way of living. But once out of that shell, it can be done, the Universe and all it has to offer is ours.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I won't spend a lot on certain things and a backpack is one of them.  I looked at many of the name brand ones and the prices were ridiculous.  This backpack has all the storage space needed and the price was perfect.  I have a Nikon D5100, extra lens, netbook laptop, asus tablet and all kinds of accessories in the backpack with room to spare.  I even have my tripod strapped to the outside.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This is another book that contains within its covers a veritable treasure trove of daily exercises-not so much physical-to relieve us of the burdens of our attained personalities that restrict us from having, doing, and being what were intended for us. Rhonda Byrne is a treasure in herself for putting together all this and The Secret together. For her and her talents I am eternally grateful.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My granddaugther loved it. She couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd I can't say anything else because I didn't watch it  nor do I want to..
B009G78EE2|5.0|I'm a huge fan of classic rap and hip-hop. I own just about every album from the 80s and 90s, Biggie, 2Pac, Dre, Wu Tang. Not a huge fan of most new rappers, but occasionally someone new comes along that catches my attention.<br /><br />I love listening to the lyrics and hearing something clever or unexpected. That's what drew me in with \\"Thrift Shop.\\" It was funny, made some good points, hit a couple social issues, and left me feeling good. Then I heard \\"Can't Hold Us.\\" A solid song about rising up and staying true to yourself. I have never downloaded an MP3 album before but I went ahead and picked up the Heist.<br /><br />I couldn't have been more surprised. I was amazed at the maturity of the lyrics. I listened from start to finish. Some songs were haunting. The music and Macklemore's delivery drives straight to your heart and drags you along for the ride. From drugh issues, the music industry, sneakers and lost friends, I couldn't wait for the next song while at the same time not wanting the one I was on to end.<br /><br />I will be downloading most, if not all, of Macklemore's work when I get home today. This is his newest and I want to see the evolution to what we have today. I think I will enjoy the journey. The Heist speaks to all kinds of people, Aspiring rappers, former drug abusers, those who struggle and continue to fight. You won't be disappointed.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I had this movie on VHS and I love this movie Cher is great in it, I watched it all the time
0060775858|5.0|This book is awesome.  I even signed the entire book in ASL. I love this book and I have the little stuffed rabbit to go with the story which makes it all the better.
B004GHNH7Q|1.0|This is a collection of commentaries. This is NOT the book. Amazon customers should not have to minutely scrutinise the &#34;guff&#34; to determine the nature of a Kindle book. Wrong purchases can't be reversed and Amazon should better highlight, for example, that this is NOT THE ACTUAL BOOk. The trusted Amazon experience and an awful experience like this (for nearly $US30) do not belong together.

B0084TWN9K|5.0|Munro is a master at creating characters and situations that break my heart.  Her stories are so rich and &#34;real&#34; that I have to take time off between them, just to catch my breath.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A very exciting book that is hard to put down!!!  I found it very intense reading but enjoyed the comic relief now and then.  It is definitely an edge-of-your-seat book and recommend it to everyone who enjoys thrillers.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I loved this movie. I saw it in the theater and bought the DVD when it came out so I could re-watch it and also share it with my friends. It is a very humanizing movie -- more about accepting yourself and your body than it is about sex. Unfortunately, the repressed people who need this the most are the least likely to sit down and watch it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it all, re-watched the first two seasons with a friend who hadn't seen any of it yet, and just HAD to see the third with her!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|so addictive! love this! Just wish I didn't have to ask for lives. Other then that glad I got it. started with it on my android.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Very interesting story, well told. And Rodriguez is so appealing as a modest, talented, accepting of life kind of guy.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Believe it or not, I found out that two close friends of mine who are sisters never read the book or saw the movie. I ordered this very reasonably priced DVD and had it sent to one of them so they could watch it together at least once. I have listened to the Audible book three times, and I've seen the movie in the theatre several times. I also purchased the Blu-Ray version, and I've watched it at home several times. This movie is such a classic that it will never grow old.
B0070066DI|4.0|I chose this fan to get quiet, adequate cooling for my Intel Core i5-3570K processor crammed into a micro-ATX case in a cabinet under my desk that also contains an identical computer and a UPS. As you might guess it gets hot under there in summer. I am not a gamer but I wanted the option to overclock in an attempt to improve performance while processing videos and photos.<br /><br />I've had the fan running continuously for about 2 months with no issues. It is very quiet. Silent, really. My Silverstone case fans are louder.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars but for the installation. It is tedious. The actual installation is relatively intuitive but the position of the fasteners makes it very difficult to get the threads started. Other than that, it's a fine product. Recommended.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I got through it but I'm not sure why.  I kept thinking there would be a common theme to link the stories but not enough to be worth the effort.  Annoying.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very enjoyable!  Great for adults and children alike.  My eleven year old grandson enjoys it as well.  Keeps my attention<br />and I always try to beat my time.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I really was interested in book one, I didn't really like it But I kept waiting for to get better I was hoping that that would happen in book 2 But it didn't for me.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is good like the rest of the books but the only difference is that this is about love. So Greg tries to get a girl but fails
B000FCKRDI|5.0|This remains one of my favorite romance books I have ever read, hands down. And I have read a lot. This is the sort of book I have re-read many times, and I hardly ever re-read things! This is by far the best book of the Wallflower series. Ever since St. Vincent's character was introduced, I was waiting for his own story, wondering how the author was going to redeem such a seemingly unredeemable jerk. His pairing with the shy, abused and fragile Evie was pitch perfect. She is also one of my favorite romance heroines, which is saying quite a bit, as I rarely truly like the heroines in this genre. Her fragile exterior and fraught personal history belie her inner strength and determination. With her quiet goodness and stubborn will, she slowly brings the jaded St. Vincent to his knees! From the beginning of the novel, when she propositions St. Vincent, I knew I was in for a great story. Because of her outward seeming helplessness, St. Vincent thinks he could control this situation to his advantage, but he is soon disabused of that notion. Evie quickly turns the tables on him with her guilelessness and gentle fortitude. St. Vincent's journey from unlikeable rogue to tender husband is just awesome to watch. He really rehabilitates his character all on his own to make himself worthy of Evie's love. He gets a job. He grows a heart. He takes a bullet for his beloved. He beats up her abusers. He swears off other women. Can't get much better than this! Even when St. Vincent refuses to acknowledge it, his helpless love for Evie is so obvious and sweet. And the love scenes are super steamy and emotionally satisfying, some of the best Lisa Kleypas has written. This book is rivaled only by Kleypas' other big &#34;gambling&#34; novel, Dreaming Of You.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is by far the best tablet game i have ever played.If you Like call of duty this app has your name all over it.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|I loved the series when  it was on tv. I wish it was still running. As it was based on the sword of truth series of books, there was enough material to continue to this tim without repeats.
B007SGM084|4.0|I think its great having all 3 of the books right in my hands at all times. I can read this book over and over again
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I love it.  Just as good as their first album.  Thanks for producing good music that inspires my children and myself!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When your at the first few levels this game is pretty simple, However as you get to the higher levels it makes you think, I play this all the time I even got the ladies I work with playing this game at lunch, hahaha its a blast!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good at first. The first third of this book is really good, the second third drags on for entirely too long and the last third infuriating. Sucky ending
B006O6F4O6|5.0|I bought this game together with 3 more action toys related to Batman also, my son really likes the character of Batman.....this Batpod Vehicle is the best among all I bought, its material is very good despite it is not from Japan as stated, but it is excellent....it has a lot of tricks to modify way of playing and from the first time it became the favorable toy to my son....It deserves each cent....I recommend it strongly.........
0425166805|5.0|This was a quick, very interesting and thought-provoking read. I highly recommend taking a read if you've been watching any of the &#34;Ancient Aliens&#34; tv series on The History Channel (H2) recently. It's a great supplement to the program!

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|So when this movie was announced I couldn't get in to it. I was just so burned out from the lord of the ring movies. My wife really wanted to go see it in the threaters so I ended up caving in.  I tried to explain to my wife that I read both the hobbit and the lord of the rings when I was a teen and the lord of the rings was three books and the hobbit was only one. So I really didn't know how they would get three movies out of it.<br /><br />Anyway this movie was one of my favorites last year so I had to get it on dvd.  It's not the same experience as IMAX or Blue Ray but I'm okay with that.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes action or fantacy.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|The original ambient artist.  Had this on tape and 35 years of l Iistening I still don't get tired of it!  Tape wears out this<br />shouldn't.

B00BIVN82M|2.0|I really like Buble but with this one I did not like the way it was produced. His vocal is often overpowered by the orchestra and other times is sounds compressed or one dimensional. Maybe I am just spoiled by his other recordings. Where his vocal really sores.

B001JI72AI|5.0|This dramatization of the problem-plagued Apollo 13 mission is an excellent movie, not only as an adventure thriller but as entertaining historical drama.  If like me, you think that mankind's destiny lay in the continuance of space exploration and exploitation, go ahead and watch and recommend this to friends and family who might be swayed by the thought of adventure, high drama, and the accomplishments that are possible with dedication to a common goal.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Loved the ending to this vast collection of books. The loose ends were tied up nicely. Everyone who ever hurt Sookie got what's good for them and we find out who she ends up with.

0547564651|5.0|I sought out this book after reading a long article in the New York Times magazine that introduced the subject of the book.  Tough is a journalist who provides a very readable, compelling, and informative overview of a very interesting topic.  He cites psychological research that identifies 24 key character skills (I would call them &#34;life skills or habits&#34;) which influence the success of individuals over their lives much more than any academic or trade skills and knowledge.  Tough wraps the narrative around stories of two school leaders, one from a very exclusive and expensive private school and one from a KIPP Charter School serving disadvantaged kids, who work together to incorporate these skills into their schools..  Both of them noted that improving the academic grades and competencies of their students was not a good predictor of their success in college and in life.  They end up working with psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania, I believe, to home in on the seven character skills that are most determinate of future success.  The KIPP school leader creates a character report card that is now used in KIPP schools along with traditional report cards, with encouraging outcomes.  The elite school leader does his best to incorporate the ideas into his school, but is not able to explicitly teach &#34;character&#34; because the parents don't see that as a role of schools.<br /><br />I would encourage every educator to read this book.  The book makes a compelling argument that the learning described here could make a big difference to help students overcome many of the issues that are bred by the dysfunctions in today's society.  And those dysfunctions are responsible for much of the &#34;failures&#34; attributed to schools today.<br /><br />This is not really about character in terms of being a good person.  Rather, it is about habits of successful people such as grit, persistence, determination, social awareness, etc.  For that reason, I would notuse the term &#34;character,&#34; which can attract controversy.  Nevertheless, the book provides enough understanding to begin to structure these life habits into a regular school curriculum.  Highly recommended!

B002HK9IDQ|4.0|I loved the movie except for the final scene. Lerner should have ended the movie the way Shaw ended his play - with Eliza exiting in triumph - leaving Higgins a crushed man, just punishment for the way he has treated her
B0052UYJDC|2.0|This book was quite a disappointment! I am not sure who's giving it the maximum of starts because it only deserves about two. I was expecting to read about an inspiring personal experience about becoming a minimalist but there were only lists of what you should or shouldn't do. The author talks at one point about leading by example and not preaching about minimalism. She does in her book just that - preaching about minimalism.

Too many characters and too little plot development.<br /><br />I swore I would never pick this series up again until it was finished. Ugg I should have kept to my vow. G. Martin is a gifted writer. He just needs some editor to stand up to him. Get him to cut out the fat in this bloated novel. It's better than the 4th book Feast of Crows, but that's not saying that much. Books 1-3 were amazing but it's been worrisome how much the storylines are just treading water.<br /><br />He seems to fallen in love with minor characters who don't really impact the story very much.<br /><br />****SPOILERS*****<br />Large chunks are devoted to minor characters and new ones that don't really have much to add to the story. And major characters are left stuck in place, literally in one case.<br /><br />Bran Stark's story seemed to be going somewhere. He was to become a greenseer and maybe overcome his crippled state or gain some wondrous powers. And yes the potential is there for something interesting. But as another reviewer put it aptly.<br /><br />\\"I'm Bran Stark. I'm a tree.\\"<br /><br />I could try to talk about the plot but I'm not sure it really matters. Characters wander from place to place (Tyrion). Or end up stuck in one place (the literally I think in the case of Bran or figuratively as with Daenerys). Really Daenerys has become the most disappointing character. if I remember correctly she seemed to be determined, and resourceful. And now she's become whiny and ineffectual. O woe is me, I'm beset by enemies and the freed slaves are suffering. My dragons are eating kidzzzzzzzz...oh wait sorry dozed off there.<br /><br />I think I'll truly wait for the series to end. The world is so wonderfully realized and the surviving interesting characters (I think that inclination to kill major characters went a bit too far) so well-written, I'm hoping it ends well.

193700788X|1.0|My definition of a superbly enjoyable book is one that lets me get so lost in the author's world that I am unable to put the book down and must continue reading into the early morning hours.  To do that, the characters, the plotting and the continuity must be believable to the extent that the author's world comes \\"alive.\\"  That's a tall order, and Charlaine Harris's SVM series did that for me for many years.  I'm grateful to her for providing me with several hours of reading pleasure.<br /><br />That said, I experienced extreme disappointment with this final book in the series.  Disappointed posters elsewhere have eloquently pointed out the several reasons for such disappointment and I won't restate them here, other than to say I completely agree with them.<br /><br />I've always been Team Sookie, which is why the following quote says so much to me:<br /><br />\\"If Charlaine Harris had written the Harry Potter series, the end of Deathly Hallows would have Harry sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs with the spiders and no magic.  While Voldemort would move in across the street, taunt him daily, and dispense life advice. All of Harry's friends that he made at Hogwarts will be either dead, betray him, or not allowed to visit. Ginny would be married to a Death Eater in order to save Harry's hitherto miserable life. But he'll be okay with that, `cause he's been thinking for some time they are too different to have a life of it.\\" ([...])<br /><br />What was going on in CH's mind?  Only she can answer that, but I suspect that when she signed over her SVM to Alan Ball of True Blood, her taste for writing the series began to increasingly go downhill.  The books began to decline right about when True Blood fever caught on.  Unlike the Twilight and Harry Potter movies, which closely followed the authors' series of books, CH's experience with True Blood was to watch her characters warp out of recognition beginning with the second season.  To lose control of your charactersand watch what happens to them has to be painful.  Alan Ball even let slip that CH was asked NOT to kill off Bill, even though she revealed in this week's Entertainment Weekly that she had had a wonderful death scene already written for Bill.  I imagine that other than the gobs of money CH earned from Mr. Ball, CH tremendously regrets selling her characters to True Blood.<br /><br />In addition, CH's extending her series to several more books than she originally planned must have affected her as well.  I can't read CH's mind, but DEA certainly made to clear to any reader that she no longer cares about her characters.  I was hopeful that she would end the SVM series with a tremendous bang, but alas, it was a painful whimper.<br /><br />******[EDIT:  new comments added below]******<br /><br />Some have expressed curiosity as to what exactly I see wrong with DEA (see my \\"won't restate [the reasons] here\\" above).  I'll point to Nora E. York's excellent review, \\"Disappointing ending to an amazing series **SPOILERS**,\\" listed just above mine, as one of many great reviews outlining the troubling issues with this book.<br /><br />I am not a \\"shipper\\" nor have I ever have been.  I don't read or write fan fiction, and I don't belong to any CH or TB forums.  I just want a well-written book that makes sense!  That's why I wrote my review in the first place:  I am struggling to understand how such a wonderful writer as CH could write such an unsatisfactory book with which to end her much-beloved SVM series.  There is no \\"hate\\" involved; just bewilderment and disappointment, and even some sympathy for CH's situation (i.e., losing control of her characters with regard to TB).  Let's face it, CH is not alone in causing her own predicament.  Both her editor and her agent failed her.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Liked the first two and was excited to read this one. I liked most of it but the ending was not what I expected.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is quite possibly the best science fiction book I have ever read. It is sci-fi with just enough science to be plausible, but not so much that you get bogged down in the details. Ender is a character I won't soon forget.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Service was great and the movie was very good.  It's a nice addition to my collection of movies.  No problems at all :)
B00006FDCD|2.0|I thought this movie was pretty bad, although it's probably because I read the book first. &#34;IT&#34; is my favorite book, and after reading it a second time I figured I might as well watch the movie. The movie was pretty sub par. The acting (aside from Pennywise, who was great) was pretty lame and they changed or cut out huge parts of the novel.<br /><br />The beginning, where Ben Hanscom goes to the bar is changed, the house on Neibolt street is completely disregarded, including Eddie's leper meeting, and tons of other parts are altered or removed.<br /><br />For 5 bucks it's not a big deal, although it was a pretty big waste of time.
193700788X|5.0|Congratulations to Charlaine Harris, not only was she able to write 13+ stories about Ms. Stackhouse and get a television series out of it, she was able to get the reader engaged to the point where with this last book emotions are blown sky high. Honestly in reading these books and reading on her website that she would never turn Sookie into a vampire the answer has always been clear. It had to be Sam in the end, now for a few minutes there I thought it might be Hunter's Dad but then that's a little too much with him being her cousin's ex. These stories are great entertainment as they were always meant to be and I for one am giving her five stars for her ability to keep me engaged for 13 books and for coming up with an ending that has created such a disturbance for some. I would recommend this series to anyone, it is a fun world to disappear in and that after all is the point of great fiction.
125000098X|4.0|OK, I just can't help it ... I thoroughly enjoy Jeffrey Archer.  I have read all three books in this series, and they keep me entertained through each minute of series.  Yes, some of the reviews indicated this book was a little slower than others, which is true, but with the job the narrators did, that didn't make any difference to me.  I can say that I was disappointed in the ending ... just left you hanging and there were parts during the book that could have been better laid out.  But all-in-all I think that Mr. Archer writes a book that keeps your attention, is always a good read and keeps you wanting more.

B00APUYWYA|1.0|My wife and I got through this incredibly lame musical not really sure why. Kept hoping that it would improve since a few family members said we should see it. This was not our \\"Cup of Tea\\" so to speak. Bizzare characters, horrible script and the jokes were more sick than ever could be funny. If you like puke than by all means watch this. Decent harmonies tho
B0000UJDLM|2.0|We couldn't believe all the cursing in this PG movie. Far too much to go unnoticed by young kids. Aside from that, the kids found far more enjoyment watching the Star Wars Movies and E.T. This one was a waste of time and money.

B000069KIZ|5.0|Despite limitations of budget and space, it's always nice to get several recordings of one's favorite music. Devotees of Brahms music, and the Austro-German classics more generally recognize Herbert von Karajan's work with the Berlin Philharmonic in raising standards of musical recording from the 1950-1980s. Although much less famous than Karajan among the general public, Karl Bohm was greatly revered as a conductor of this music, and among his greatest accomplishments were his outstanding recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. The VPO has Brahms' music in their blood, and in this Brahms cycle with Bohm, they really deliver. The Alto Rhapsody, op. 53 and the Tragic Overture, op. 81 are nice bonuses following the 2nd Symphony. For Brahms lovers, this box set is a must!

0452295548|5.0|The  insight shared by this brain research scientist, stemmed  from her own experience as a stroke victim, is far superior to any I have previously known/experienced as a lay person, or as I have observed by any professional who has worked with  stroke victims within my own family. It  provides a hugely constructive ray of informational insight about how to interact with, treat/relate to a stroke victim. No doubt, if practiced as recommended by Jill Taylor, any stroke victim will be tremendously less frustrated and more able to achieve full recovery.

B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|6th album from Georgia musician--Matthew Houck has the kind of voice that embodies the<br />  poignancy, the soul of heartache; and his lyrics give the voice something to sing.  Musically,<br />  Phosphorescent comes from the Americana school that ignores boundaries and incorporates<br />  diversity with a natural grace & style.  Pedal steel and fiddle merge with synthesizers, trumpets,<br />  saxophones, bongos & more.  Songs remain true to the spirit of Nashville, but are allowed to<br />  breathe beyond the restriction of tradition.  Similarities to Will Oldham, Palace Brothers, Midlake,<br />  the Band, Grandaddy.  Sometimes it feels like you're in a corner bar nursing a beer, sometimes it<br />  feels like Lambchop is sharing the stage with Spiritualized.  Subtle, nice, real.

B00BI6SSMC|3.0|6th album since 2002 from Austin, Texas artist Samuel Beam & friends.  There is a lot of diversity<br />  here, though less emphasis on the Americana aspect.  You get:  jazzy island pop with horns, soft<br />  love ballads with backing 50s style vocal chorus & horns, a cheesy little folk-style love song, an<br />  eerie song about jealousy with a funky bass & saxophone, etc.  In a sense, it's a logical<br />  extension of 2011's \\"Kiss Each Other Clean\\", which I liked a lot.  Overall, though, it's nothing<br />  more or less than a clever, well-played jazzy folk/country/Americana pop/easy listening album<br />  with above average lyrics.  It's nice.  I feel like I should respect the effort & the talent here;<br />  obviously a lot of thought went into the album.  But, ultimately, it's just not very exciting.

B00BSBUZT6|5.0|No surprise I went straight to the 3rd Blu-ray disc and live Wash D.C performance from '77.  I was surprised how good it was on many levels. First, I've seen the Houston performance of the same year - the only footage of the Hotel California tour up until this package came out. I have a ton of respect for Don Felder but the solo on One of These Nights (it's on youtube), to be kind, didn't go so well. I could be wrong but he looked high on something at varying points during that show, so maybe that was the reason for the less than flawless performance.  If I remember correctly, much of that performance was somewhat sloppy.  Don's  book mentioned the drugs were quite prevalent so it was really nice to see such a professional performance in D.C. - not to mention the Hotel California tour.  He was more or less perfect throughout, which was nice to see.  The whole show was absolutely spot on - vocals, solos, everything.  Secondly, I own a bunch of Blu-ray concerts filmed in more recent years, but this D.C. show from '77 looked and sounded as good as most of those newer shows that I own - hard to believe but true.  Sure, it would have been nice to have an entire concert, but this is the only quality snap shot of the Eagles performing live in that time period, so let's all be grateful for that.  I'm sure the rest of the program will be great and there are already enough reviews of the documentary portion. Buy it.
B0019KC4UE|5.0|the import cd/sacd plus bonus dvd was the best sound out there except the sacd part. it was to loud, compressed and distorted. the dvd 5.1 made up for that. what a wonderful treat.

0553256491|5.0|I first read this book when it was originally published in 1985 and thought then that in addition to being a brilliant, Nobel Prize winning physicist, Richard Feynman was a great storyteller. Somehow over the years my copy of the book vanished (I may have given it to someone or I may have lost it) so when I saw it available on Amazon I bought it again. My original opinion remains valid.<br /><br />I am not qualified to comment on Richard Feynman as a physicist, but his ability to reduce complex thoughts to clear and understandable prose is formidable. In other words, he tells a great story. He is also a very funny guy.

B0054XOMX4|1.0|First of all this review should be written by my son.I thought  this Blade was a great idea, Having that rotating  wheel,but after using it 2 times the wheel was already bent . Probably from the hitting. Yes it turns by itself for about 6 minutes but in a battle it seen to be easily thrown against the walls of the stadium and even out of the stadium. I will buy him a new one and see if it have the same result. Like I said that kind of rotation system should be an advantage in a battle of the Blades.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|The funniest movie I have seen in avery long time saw it in my ipad in a plane and laughed all through the movie! I loved the characters they are very convincing and have the capacity to have a great sense of humor in situations that may be devastating to other people! The casting is exceptional and the script superb, the director did a great job capturing the essence in the lives of these two individuals and turn this into a fantastic comedy and acting! Highlyentertaining and a classic in the genre!!,

0062014536|3.0|My review title says it all. What happened? Seriously Lauren Oliver, WHAT HAPPENED? Delrium and Pandemonium were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL, but what happened? Yes, I liked the idea of telling the story between the alternating points of view of Hana and Lena, yes the beginning and the middle were engaging, but the end? I was expecting an answer to the question ALEX OR JULIAN? ALEX OR JULIAN? ALEX OR JULIAN? A million times i have asked that question. Ever since i read Delirium a few months ago I've been constantly asking this question. I thought the answer was in Requiem. I was quite disappointed.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Every time I think my life is boring and doesn't have enough excitement in it I sit down and watch this movie.
0062059963|4.0|I'll start off by saying that The Elite isn't ENTIRELY amazing. It isn't that nice as The Selection, but the book still somehow continues the Maxerica story. What I especially liked here was practically only the beginning, particularly chapters 5 and 8. What I disliked about this book was that it included quite a lot of rebel-related events, which, for me, wasn't necessary at all. The rebels don't affect Maxon and America's story at all. I think Kiera Cass was trying to expand the story by trying to add events so there would still be something to expect for in the third book. I cannot wait for the next book and FOR MAXON TO DISMISS THE REST OF THE GIRLS EXCEPT FOR AMERICA SINGER <3

0062200909|5.0|This book is so detailed that I found it to be overly so at times. Probably because I own just about every LOTR movie book, this book couldn't really shed any more light on Peter Jackson's movie-making. Lots of new and different art, for sure. In short, if you're looking for an education, you will not find it here. If you only want to see the various artwork and designs that went into the movie design, yes, you will find it in abundance.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|A family member introduced this game to me awhile back and the first time I played, I didn't quite grasp the concept and we also didn't get to finish the game.  I didn't think much of SoC.<br /><br />About a year or so later, different family brought SoC over and I tried it again and loved it.  The strategy involved becomes more apparent after the first playing and continues on from there.  Playing w/ someone who has played before is a big plus, in which case, my 7 yr. old nephew can play pretty competitively now.  (He started at 6 and is too smart for his own good).<br /><br />The balance in the game is quite good.  Everyone stays in the game until the end (unlike games such as Monopoly) and if someone feels they are behind, there is a good chance they can catch up a bit as they won't be the focus of \\"robber\\" attacks as any clear leader in the game will attract that focus.  It also becomes harder for the leader to make card trades w/ other players, making the last few points a struggle.<br /><br />The end game can be quite intense, bringing out a flurry of emotions for all involved.  While there is strategy in town/city placement, which way you build your roads, what you buy w/ your cards, (road/town/city/developement cards) dice rolling plays a part and keeps things random enough that rolls may not go well for the better player.<br /><br />To see the game in action, check out [...]
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I could not watch this movie in the theaters, so had to catch it on the Bluray. I had to get over my nostalgia (from LOTR) watching Hobbitton in its idyllic settings, with its lush greens and beautiful vistas. It felt like watching a drawing on the canvas.<br />Then came our good old Bilbo, and some old characters from the older movies. It was a good reunion before we plunged into Bilbo's adventures.<br />Without giving away any details, I would say the new cast (the lead roles) did an excellent job breathing life into Middle Earth once again. Now I need to watch the 3D disc.

B00BWBHIUG|3.0|My girls like it but they're almost constantly trying to buy some credits for something. When I tried showing them what to do I found the order in which you have to do stuff is a little rigid. Also when items you harvest are close to an action icon, the game always chooses the action instead of picking up the item. This is where the girls were getting pushed to buy something, so I moved the action item way off to side to let them keep playing.<br /><br />But on the plus side it's really nice graphics.
0735201684|5.0|I love this book by Dr. Joseph Murphy. If you have any interest in the subconscious mind, how it works, how to impress upon it the desires of your heart etc., I would highly recommend this book.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The entire family loved this film. It is just beautifully done.  We got an incredible price on Amazon.I can't wait for the rest of it to come out!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not stop reading this book! When I wasn't reading it I was wishing I was. It draws you in and you just want more. I am definitely going to read the others!
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game is Sooooo.... stupid DONT BUY IT ITS A RIP OFF BY THE ONE ON THE PC IT WOULD BE OK IF IT HAD ONLINE MULTIPLAYER...BUT YOU HAVE TO DO ALL THIS MODDING STUFF TO DO.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is very fun! I am 30 and play it all the time. It is well worth the 99 cents! Only have had a few glitches of not getting money added to account, but nothing major.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It works really well. Kinda wish there were more options available, but I guess that's what the upgrade is for.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Not actually ever watchig this until this year, myhusband and I became fans very fast. I wanted every series they made to catch up with it and the only place who could fill that request was Amazon. This series is a 10 star...too bad I could only do five. Writers are brilliant and I dont think there is a person out there that cant relate once or twice with some of the characters. Excellent all the way around;; series, actors, writers and my favorite AMAZON for having it all at a price I can afford.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|Works marvelously with my IPad 4. I recommend this for any fan of gameloft games.<br /><br />So far no cons of significant consequence.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is a zillion star show. Five is not enough stars. Brilliant casting, writing and story lines. I got about the &#34;big Bang&#34; train late, thinking I wouldn't care for this show, but Boy, was I wrong. Its on the floor funny.  Theres a little of Sheldon and the gang in all of us. I can relate very well. Pick this series up and I promise you wont be sorry.
B002GHIPYI|1.0|First impression:<br />It is significantly brighter than my Sony XB300 but that's to be expected. I can see it becoming annoying listening to it for too long at a high enough volume. For 30 bucks this has a great sound stage. Definitely the best sounding headphones I've bought. Comfort is a slight problem due to the hard clamping force on your head but I stretched it out and now its better, but nowhere near the comfort of the XB300. I prefer on ear headphones rather than around the ear can's like these. If you use headphones a lot I wouldn't recommend these or any around the ear headphones. I would get on ear ones because no matter what they'll be much more comfortable.<br /><br />Edit:<br />After using it for a couple of days as my default I just can't get over the screechy highs. It's just too out of balance for me to listen to for a long time without giving me a headache. Definitely don't recommend these if you use headphones a lot throughout the day.<br /><br />Also these have made me realize I don't like open ended headphones because of all the outside noise that leaks in.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I have the whole set from season one and there isn't a bad one in the whole set. Its brilliantly written and each one of the cast members deserve to have a wall full of Emmys.. I think you can see a little of yourself in each of these characters. Writters are brilliant and I would recommend this series to everyone!!!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE AT THE THEATER AND WANTED TO SEE IT AGAIN SO PURCHASED IT. I LOVE THE MOVIE.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I had read some mixed reviews about this book, and must say, that I am glad that I don't usually pay too much attention to reviews...This book is addictive, to the point that I was hiding my kindle under paperwork on my desk at work just so that I could keep reading...<br /><br />I thought that I had the plot picked pretty early in the piece, it became apparent pretty quick, that while I was somewhat right, I was also very wrong in where this story was headed!!!
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Definitely a must see for LotR fans. I think it was a bit drawn out but overall worth the purchase.
B005D4YOFK|1.0|I ordered and received Mens 9M - much to my chagrin, these sandals were closer to a size 6. I have to believe there was a misprint of 9 / 6.  This is the second consecutive shoe order placed on amazon where I have had to return due to sizing issue.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Cordless swivel<br />works super love the flexability picks up everything and so lite and easy to handle<br />would recommend it to anyone will probably buy 1 or 2 more for the house and camper
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm so sad the series is complete! I would have preferred a different ending, but this one suits the series. I really hate saying goodbye to Bon Temps, but I feel a sense of closure with great potential for a follow up with our favorite characters later.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not the best movie ... the premise OK but I questioned the casting .. there didn't seem to be any chemistry between the actors.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|I have no idea why people are giving bad reviews about in app purchases. I am on the third island and have not seen any links, ad or any request to purchase during the game. Its just one of those repetitive time managed game. The puzzle at the end of each island is a bit annoying since i am not into that.<br /><br />Yes there is a bit of a long black screen at the end of each  level is annoying. Otherwise i would give it a 5star!<br /><br />The price? Well if u are into time management games like Farm Frenzy, Cake mania or Airport mania etc.. those cost approx 5bucks. This one does seem to have a bit less levels since i have played for  2 hours and on the third island. it seems like there are only 4 island. So for 4hour game this game is a bit more expensive than the other ones I've played. Other than that for FAOTD its a great deal!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One was an amazing novel.  Once I started, it was so hard to stop!  It sucked me right in.  There are so many obscure and awesome 80's references, and I'm a sucker for references.<br /><br />The plot was a unique one, in my opinion, mostly because the world it takes place in is totally crazy and futuristic, but I can see it happening someday.  There was action, love, scary villains, puzzles, and so much more.<br /><br />My only critique was with character development.  I found it very confusing at times to understand just how old the main characters were.  Art3mis starts out seeming like a 12 year old, despite being told that he's in high school, but by the end he's like in his late 20's, though not that many years have passed.  I just couldn't really sort him out, and so I ended up just going with the flow and accepting him as he was presented at any moment.<br /><br />But other than that, this book was fantastic and I loved it!  I definitely recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing,highly addictive,lots of concentration while playing ,my children got me into this game ,best thing ever if you want to chill out thanks to subway surfer s
193700788X|1.0|I've been a fan of the series for quite a while. Having lived outside of Shreveport for several years it was especially dear to me.<br /><br />The first several books were phenomenal. I was enthralled with the \\"Sookie-verse\\" Ms. Harris created and the very colorful characters. I found myself rooting for Sookie and Bill through the first few books.I didn't particularly like Eric but Harris developed the relationship between Sookie and Eric so well that I found myself switching my allegiance quite quickly.<br /><br />The last few books however, left me feeling slightly cheated. The story did not move very much and everything seemed to be stagnant. I forgave Harris, figuring that this was all a build-up to a very dynamic, explosive finale.<br /><br />I was sorely disappointed. This \\"finale\\" was terrible from many perspectives. I'd like to make clear that I don't necessarily like happy endings or everything wrapped up with a pretty little bow, but this ending was beyond lazy and careless.<br /><br />As some of the previous reviewers have rightly mentioned, many of the major players acted completely out of character. There were also many continuity issues.<br /><br />***Here comes a spoiler so please don't read any more if you don't want to know***<br /><br />*************<br /><br />Eric and Sookie have been through so much together. Even if their love was strengthened simply because of their bond, I can't see that intense of a relationship ending in such a flat manner. Eric did come see her and she sent him away. I understand that didn't leave much of an opportunity for discussion but it was completely out of character for both Sookie and Eric to not fight a little harder, to not *try* to get through to one another. Even after the marriage \\"annulment\\" the contact between them was not true to form. Oh hey Pam send her a text! He leaves Sookie in Louisiana without so much as a by your leave in the end and she didn't even seem to really care.<br /><br />I've always likedthe character of Sam but he and Sookie have never felt right together, mainly because of Harris' own setup. For Harris to abruptly reverse her position on their sibling type relationship with no explanation (aside from a reference or two to the Cluviel Dor) was lazy at best.<br /><br />All the other bits with Mr. C, Diantha, Amelia and Bob, Quinn (bringing back a great character for no reason), made it seem like we were being thrown scraps. Oh look Steve Newlin!<br /><br />13 books and where has Sookie gotten? Pretty much nowhere.<br /><br />Ms. Harris has no doubt made quite a bit of money from the series as well as selling the rights to HBO. It's obvious from the last few books and this dismal finale that she stopped caring about the \\"Sookie-verse\\" she created (as well as her readers) a while ago.<br /><br />I unfortunately won't be reading any more of her work. I did enjoy the Harper Connolly series but any writer who has such a blatant disregard for the integrity of their work isn't worth the money.
B008G12ERC|5.0|I absolutely love this CD! (and I am 40+)! I am a Queen fan from the early days and this CD has the same type of Freddie Mercury &#34;quality&#34; that made me love that band as well. You just have to listen to ALL of it to appreciate it fully.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great simple game, keeps my kids happy for hours , works on hand eye coordination as well. Also great game to play while travelling
1780721676|4.0|A remarkable take on fasting to improve health. Reducing calories twice a week is far more manageable than more severe fasting methods. So many people have found this a sensible way to lose fat and improve their lab readings, that the benefits are becoming more apparent with time. I just wish the calorie count section had a little more detail - does 'scrambled eggs' contain one, two (or more} eggs?<br />Hoping for a dvd to accompany this at some point. Caught the last part of the TV program which started the whole thing, but would really like to have a dvd to show friends who are interested.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I love Kate is this movie. I love this whole movie cause nonstop action and has a really good story to tell about the werewolfs and Vampires. I love the actors in this whole movie.

B0024RIMBG|5.0|The (3) Celtic Women DVD's I received were every bit as entertaining and inspiring as I knew they would be. The DVD quality is excellent, and the Amazon purchasing procedure is as easy and user-friendly as always....Which is why I continue to order favorite items from Amazon. Thank You!
0099579936|5.0|This book was not about sex as much as I expected. Its basically Twilight with hotter and less annoying characters that have an interesting sex life. I absolutely loved this book and recommend it to those mature enough to handle a sexual imagination.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|The first half of the book was fast-paced and held the reader's attention. Unfortunately, the last half was slow and predictable. Son a good book and a good ending to the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an awesome game where you to jump on trains and run away from the guard and his dog. You can change you outfits and fly on hoverboards while you collect as many coins as you can.this game is addictive and once you have the highest possible score you can make then you just won't put the game down until you get a new score. I give this game 5/5.
B006H3MJ7G|5.0|This is one of the best CDs ever. The Bachata beat, his voice, and the Spanish language are a combination one can't beat.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|Frankl experience the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp firsthand, and had his life stripped away, piece by piece.<br /><br />The first part of the book details his journey through this unspeakable suffering. We share his discoveries of truth about life's purpose that gave him strength to survive.<br /><br />Those discoveries form the basis for a philosophy he calls &#34;logotherapy.&#34; The second part of the book goes into detail about this philosophy.<br /><br />Powerful affirmation that every life has meaning, even in the darkest of times.

0765342294|5.0|Somehow I missed this book all my life and suddenly ran into two unrelated folks who asked how I could possibly not have read it, how it's a major classic and how they'd read it multiple times, so I got it.<br /><br />This edition is a reasonably priced paperback and fine, and the story is excellent.  In some ways, it's a fairly lengthy and almost redundant narrative for much of the book, interesting enough and progressing along as it's read, but okay, where's this all going?  Then, in the final chapters, some zigs and zags and unexpected turns and it all becomes clear.  Do not skip ahead to read the ending (as I and many others sometimes do).<br /><br />I see that there's a movie of it coming later this year (2013), will see it and hope that the movie holds to the book reasonably well.  Even with Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, excellent as they were, the books were better.  (Jackson did have to leave out some things to keep movie length within reason by commercial standards, agreed, but many reasons why things were the way they were, sadly got left out.  For example, Jackson said that he left out the Tom Bombadil section where the hobbits get their swords because it was not required &#34;to get the ring to Mordor&#34;, which would've been true if he was developing a plot from scratch or doing a new story, but he was making a movie of a well-known, well-loved, pre-existing classic, which is not the same situation, so when a nazgul gets stabbed, in the book it's noted as especially damaging to the bad guy because the sword was made by elves with magic, while in the movie it's just a sword from nowhere in particular that was thrown to the hobbits without fanfare for them to use, a shame.  Jackson could've at least had the swords' origin noted in a one-liner but didn't.  In his movie, The Hobbit, Jackson made the same mistakes he made for his King Kong, messing with plot (e.g., making Bilbo, not Gandalf, the cause of the trolls' demise) and (sigh) giving into massive, Indiana Jones like special effects in the goblin caves instead of telling the tale and preserving the more personal, hobbit-scaled atmosphere from the book, which I think is why most folks liked the movie but didn't love it.  One can only hope that Ender's Game, the movie, doesn't screw up.)<br /><br />In any case, an excellent book.  Science fiction is sometimes exciting, sometimes explores new technology that actually shows up later in real life, and sometimes makes important points about our values and behaviors.  Many people do not see that science fiction can be as impactful and relevant as a &#34;serious&#34; drama.  Ender's Game is a fun read, explores technology, and most importantly makes one pause for thought several times, especially in the final chapters.  Good and Evil aren't always what one expects them to be.<br /><br />It doesn't get much better.
B008220C38|1.0|It was more like a bad play than a movie and the writer/producer/director should be ashamed.  It was worse than his Pride and Prejudice and if he does anything else I will make sure not to waste time or money to see.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is the best battery spp I have found to date. I run it on my Kindle Fires and my android phones it gives me accurate battery life as well as letting me know how long the juice that's left should last. A must have and the small price for the pro is worth it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My son loves this app.  It keeps him occupied for hours and for a 7 year old he is getting quite good at it.  He loves choosing different characters and reaching new levels and the incentives given.  I just which there wasn't the constant push for him to purchase things but with a little coaxing they can be avoided.  Overall this app is functioning well and we have it on more than one device so by far this is one of the more popular games in our household at the moment.

B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|The biggest problem for me and my hand type is ergonomics, I honestly can't use this mouse for longer than 5 minutes. While using the mouse my pinky starts to feel all weird and I have this strong urge to stop using the mouse, I read people saying that the grip is good, but if you have my hand type, you may find this mouse unusable.<br /><br />Because I know what a good mouse feels like, I can tell when tracking is not any good, although the DPI is really high, I have a hard time being precise and that causes stress on wrist, and pain in your neck after a while, lowering the DPI does not fix the issue.<br /><br />The thumb buttons feel cheap and plasticky, but for the price what do you expect. I appreciate the rubber grip, and the fact that you can add weight to the mouse, (I did have a hard time opening the round plastic part, it was at least 10 minutes of trying) may I suggest to make it even heavier and improve the opening mechanism, or maybe give better tips in the instruction manual.<br /><br />On the plus side, this mouse is highly customizable in windows, you have all sorts of options for macros, changing color of the Anker logo, although it would be nice if you could also link that color change with the scroll wheel, because in fact that is what you will mostly see with your peripheral vision.<br /><br />I bought this mouse in hope of finding a great gaming & perhaps work mouse. For work I use a hackintosh and for play I dual boot into windows 8. my work mouse is \\"Performance Mouse MX\\" and my gaming mouse is \\"Razer Deathader\\".<br /><br />On my work hackintosh I had no success at getting the forward and back button keys to function, usually for the \\"unsupported\\" mice I use a third party app called \\"Steermouse\\" to assign actions to the extra button keys such as button #4 & #5, \\"stearmouse\\" has never lets me down, except with Anker mouse. The extra button keys are probably coded in some unique and unusual way that is windows only. No Mac drivers is a big let down for me.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />By no means is this a bad mouse, I'm sure many people won't have a problem with it, but in my case there are so many problems that this mouse is just not for me.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Customer support is superb, I have not seen this kind of care from other companies, and for that they deserve another star.<br /><br />Edit #2:<br />After trying out: G700s, G500s, Advance II, Spawn, Kone, Savu, Naga Hex, Corsair M65, NAOS 8200, DeathAder 3.5, Microsoft 4000, Microsoft 5000, Logitech Performance MX, Logitech m325, Apple Magic Mouse to name  a few mice I am starting to understand why I dislike Anker Gaming mice. For one there are curves that try to keep your index & middle finger kinda inside the buttons, which causes a bit of a tingling sensation on the fingers ligaments, this is very bad ergonomics, your fingers should not inclose but the opposite, second the scroll wheel is not bulging up enough, some may like that, but in addition to my first point this makes it even worse, third issue is that the mouse tries to do what the Performance mouse MX does and curves the body shape towards the bottom right side, but that causes your wrist to go into an uncomfortable angle, and actually make it less enjoyable to use the mouse, what I found is a really tall turtle shell styles mouse is always best also, round of the left & right click buttons to allow your fingers to be more free, second don't create too much bulk in the rear of the mouse, and another thing, most men's middle fingers are longer than their index finger, on this mouse its reverse, the right click is longer while the left click is shorter, so instead, make them totally even or reverse the order for better ergonomics.

I wish there would have been more of Sookie and her beau, and the one little group of miscreants trying to kill Sookie was a stretch for me. However, I think this is the HEA that Sookie deserved. I love this series! Also, if you're surprised that Sookie did not end up with someone I won't name you haven't been paying attention for the last few books. Just remember these books are about Sookies journey to her HEA.

Not your traditional &#34;Super Group&#34; trying to make the perfect album. They just rock arguably better than any other band out there.
B000056H24|5.0|This is a great movie to summarize the Sunday School lessons we have read from the bible. It is a very long movie so it needs to be be broken up into several sessions. But unlike many movies today, this one has no foul language and is not too violent for young eyes. The only negative that I could see was some screen darkness in certain scenes. There was also enough quiet time between dialogue where I could whisper, &#34;remember this part?&#34;. I showed this movie to 4th and 5th grade children and they enjoyed it!

B009NY43NY|1.0|I found this final Sookie book to be one written without any craft or care. Any sense of character continuity was lost a long time ago but I had hoped that Harris could rally for a decent ending. She did not.<br /><br />The struggle to get this book to the publisher shows in every chapter of clunky plot devices and hackneyed story lines. The fact that \\"Eric left some stuff in a closet\\" became a painful lynch pin of the action shows how little Harris cared about the quality of this book.<br /><br />I had set the standard for this book very low based upon the last few but I was still left wanting. I am embarrassed for even having purchased this. Well at least it won't be lying around the house in physical form to haunt me.<br /><br />We definitely need a no star rating here. Just for days like today.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|These are better than the DVD. The picture is better and so is the sound. I enjoyed watching these. If you like Star wars a must for any collection.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Books of this quality come along only once every generation or so.  Don't postpone the experience. I'll be surprised if you don't decide to buy it. It's that good. If all books were this good, there would be no television.
B000PMG16U|5.0|I just watched all of these and they are great. The sound and picture is some much better than the DVD. A must if you are into star wars.
B006546EPA|5.0|All of the great symphonic and operatic works in one collection.  The music is exception and the various artists and performers are all captured at the peak of their careers.  A 'must' have for any classical music collection.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|I have this on DVD and upgraded to the Blu-Ray. The sound is better and so is the picture. If you haven't bought this movie yet you should on Blu-ray.
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|Wow.  I have been a Bernstein follower since I was a child.  I had nearly all of these performances on LP's but wanted the smaller size of the CD collection to help with storage.  The sounds are just as great as I have always remembered.  The packaging is perfect.  Now I can't wait for the next Bernstein collection of Overtures, Ballets, Symphonic suites, etc. to be released.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I am a fan of James Bond- all of them really. Wanted to have this one in my collection too and was happy with the price at which I got it from Amazon. Thanks! Arrived well packed and soon enough.
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|This is a wonderful production.  I have all of the various versions that have been made of the King Kong story and this by far is the best.  Naomi Watts is mesmerizing as she transforms from a simple vaudvillian actress to the stronger minded woman, determined to outwit and escape from the beast, only to realize in the end that she alone could provide the release that the ape needs as he is tormented and killed by people who have no understanding of his plight.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Thanks for the prompt delivery of this item. We are big fans of the entire 'Lord of the Rings' series and liked this first Hobbit movie too. We decided to buy this one to add to our earlier collection and were happy to have found it at such a reasonable price on Amazon. Arrived well packed. Happy with the purchase. Thanks!
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|This is another of his greatest albums and if you are a fan you need to have this album. This young man sets a fire burning in me that nothing will ever put out. May his voice and playing live on on blues lovers world wide.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|You can see how it could happen!  Read for second time and well worth your consideration.  Daemon and freedom also!
B0090OW7J4|3.0|I was disappointed in Dirty Jeans & Mudslide Hymns and completely uninterested in listening to it again but this one is somewhere between okay and really digging it. A good solid mixture and reminded me of what I like about him in general.
B009S33I68|5.0|I read this book several years ago and thought it was  well written and informative.  It's great to read again (am still reading it) and I would highly recommend it.
B00138H95M|4.0|Johnny just does me right. Highway 61 is one of the best versions I've heard of this song. He gets every song right with the grit and passion he possesses me just the right way in the right spot.
B001NN4162|5.0|I can finally get the kids to sit down and watch a whole movie.The problem is ,now they won't stop watching it. I might send it home with them,I 'm 65 a couple of times is. Okay for me!
B000002JAX|2.0|I just found it passionless and without a lot of vigor - kind of like the album photo cover, basically a blur and not memorable.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|A very good first book of a series, a great reminiscence of 'Ender's Game' meets 'Hunger Games.'  The middle of the book is a bit slow, but I understand why the author had to do it to set up the games and characters.  Good ending with a good minor cliffhanger that makes you want to read on.  Very well written and I think it will be more enjoyable for a younger reader rather than me, a bitter old man.
B0060ANP10|5.0|There's very little Johnny can do wrong because he is so right and out of sight. I love the blues and Winter sure can play them. Winter produced three Grammy Award-winning albums for blues legend Muddy Waters. &#34;Silver Train&#34; and &#34;Let It Bleed&#34; feature Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. &#34;Rock Me Baby&#34; rocks me good!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun to play. Once you start its hard to stop playing. It's kind of sad when you run out of coins.
B00006399Z|5.0|I began listening to this album in 1976 - I believe and it is tied in to many memories beside being great music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a game full of excitement and adventure! I enjoy this,I love.playing this game!every time I have extra time I will grab my kindle and play play play!
B000063147|5.0|Being their first album new fans might find it a little different in taste than their newer music (Self-titled/Nightmare), but as always it is a great start to an amazing band.
B009NY43NY|3.0|First off, I am a HUGE fan of this series, and I don't think this book is as bad as everyone else is saying. Having said that, I was a little disappointed in the ending. I feel like there are so many loose ends and unanswered questions left to end it all, and that really bums me out :(
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Being the second album it's a change from the first, and new fans might find it in a different taste than their current album but as always Avenged Sevenfold never fails to please their fans.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoyed using this app. It is really fun and pretty simple to opperate. I wish that I could choose my own username and horse, though.
193700788X|5.0|Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Birds gotta swim, Fish gotta fly, Haters gotta hate.  \\"Those who CAN, DO.  Those who CAN'T, CRITICIZE.\\"  I found the last Sookie book to be well-written, enthralling, and satisfying.  The loose ends are wrapped up, Sookie has a CHANCE at happiness, and I'm just sad that it is over.  I enjoyed this book as much, or more, than any CH has ever written.  This will always be on my re-read list for series novels.  Don't like it?  Don't read it again.  I rate you poor-mouthers right down there with that German a$$tard that released the book early, and, frankly, all of you can bite me.  Or try.  Your choice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG! Me and my little sis Molly are addicted to this game! The graphics are awesome,the music is cool, and you can jump over obstacles! You will love it so much. GET IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
B00BK5D95C|5.0|My sister had my listen to this band and I just gotta say, they are AMAZING! I love the beats that they use in their songs and I love the lyrics. They all tell a story and you can feel the emotion in every song. I would recommend this to anyone!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I thought this book was very good and magical.My  favorite  character was Toto because he sounds so cute.I really really loved this book
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I love the Dickens Christmas Carol story. I have many of the movies made of it. This one is really good even though it is animated.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Most disappointing book.  CH sold out her readers AGAIN, AGAIN, AGAIN, AGAIN AND AGAIN. I became aware of the books after the True Blood Series came out.  I read books 1-8 back to back and I reread them, and I never reread a book.  I truly enjoyed them. They were adult fairy tales.  A telepath, vamps, weres, shifters, demons, fairy's, woodland creatures and Elvis.  What's not to like? I loved Charlaine's humor and imagination and I couldn't get enough of these books. I think Charlaine's stubborn refusal to allow Sookie to become a vampire from the outset of the series stiffled her and forced her to contrive a very boring and pedestrian ending to this series.  I'm not saying Sookie should have become a vamp, but maybe if the author was not so adamant from the outset, the story might  have flowed differently.  Sookie was thrust into an exciting world and in the end she's left with what?  SPOILER ALERT  A life with Sam and maybe a shifter cub with telepathic abilities and fae blood????? and still a bar maid or partner/barmaid BORING. I kept waiting for the good part to come throughout the book but it never came. And if Ms. Harris thinks that the good part was sex with Sam, well that was just gross, I felt like she was sleeping with her brother. I was wating for Eric to step in an do something Eric, but that never happened.  Eric was such a major part of the story and he was so full of life (death) and mischief and Charlaine just sent him off without a whimper to Kentucky, Oklahoma whatever who cares. He was not the Eric in the first eight books.  He would have done something outrageous just to screw with somebody's head.  The vampires who came to Bon Temps in the beginning books were not the ones we were left with in the end.  They are a pathetic lot, just like books 10 - 13 PATHETIC.  If what I've read elsewhere is correct, Ms Harris wanted to end the Series at Book 8, but she chose money over quality and readers be damned.  The quality went down with each subsequentbook, but I thought at least she would end the series with a bang.  I not even sure she wrote the last 5 books, the quality is so poor and the characters so different from the first 8.  Maybe she has a computer program and just fills in the names, tells the computer the ending desired, and lets the computer do the rest.  There were other ways that Sookie could have stayed human and remained with Eric for a long time.  Her grandfather Fintan was half fae and live 750 yrs, her father could than conceivably live 375 yrs and Sookie maybe 150+ yrs.  There was passing reference in an earlier book that Sookie was aging at a slower pace.  See, computers or authors who lost interest in their work have no immagination.  I am really annoyed that I paid $15.00 each for the last 5 ebooks and like I said in the title for this review I hope Ms Harris enjoys her 30 pieces of silver.  I will never read another book by her again.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Love this CD! I listen to it all the time! It has all my favorite Pink songs on it! Fantastic CD!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great app that lets you shop and order and pay on your Amazon account. I use it to tract shipments too. Great little app.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Love this CD! It has all of my favorite Katy Perry songs on it.  I never get tired of listening to it.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Great Movie, 98% accurate to actual events. Movie is a little slow and you must hang in there to appreciate. Abraham Lincoln is my favorite president and I have a lot of movies about his life.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I would recommend that you not let anyone under the age of 10 watch this movie but for adults it was very very good movie happy that i purchased it  worth the money
1451695195|2.0|It was pretty cerebral in places.  It didn't really talk much<br />about Heaven.  His experience was quite unique, and I<br />was disappointed that it didn't include anything about<br />God or Jesus.  I guess I expected more.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|We bought this CD for my girls for the Christmas gift. The quality is good. We are happy about it.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This was my first gaming mouse.  I am overall pleased with my purchase and have grown used to the design and feel.<br /><br />However; I would have liked to have a layman instruction on what the different mhz, sensitivity and speeds actually translated for the novice.  It took a week of tinkering to find a speed and feel I was comfortable with.<br /><br />TL:DR good value need better instruction book
B007SGM084|5.0|I think I'm entering a state of depression now that it is over.. Please write more. I definitely recommend this book.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I began playing Angry Birds when my husband bought his Android phone a few years ago. So, when I got my Kindle Fire, it was one of the first apps that I downloaded. I loved this app and the game itself. No complaints with this app or game.
0385343248|4.0|This is a favorite book of mine and I wanted to share it with a colleague.<br /><br />The book arrived in above average condition which makes it all the better to share.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|The Lion King is a wonderful story and is equally enjoyed by children and adults. The Bluray version seems to be much better quality than my old VHS tape.
B007V4530A|4.0|Jeremy Donovan's &#34;How to Deliver a TED Talk&#34; is a great, quick read suitable for either beginners or experienced pros. The book is filled with helpful tips and examples. He evenincludes recommendations as minor as font size. It's also short read you get through rapidly and easily.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|I have purchased all of the Twilight Saga soundtracks and enjoy this one very much, although it seems as though the Breaking Dawn soundtracks repeat some songs and musical scores from prior Twilight movies, so these did not need to be included again on the CD.
B000P7V45S|5.0|The creative imagination of Genesis on this album was intense and the lyrics could have been a book of bedtime stories.  You don't have to listen very hard to hear every instrument that is being played, as they flow from one song to another.  The music is crisp, exciting, sad, and dramatic.  This is where 'Ripples' made it's debut and became a hit song, personally, my favorite is 'Entangled' a dreamy ride on the perfect lake with a touch of ........, you figure it out!<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who thinks 'Genesis' is for nerdy hippies!
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather has shown to be my go to weather app on all of my devices. They seem to be the only weather app that I have used that doesn't crash frequently, as well as has a lot of different features.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Do not be misled by other reviewers. One choice is not a reason to hate a book or the series.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I had been hearing their music on the radio, ads, and finally when I heard Radioactive at the end of The Host, I knew that I had to have it! This is such a wonderful album that I am quite addicted to right now. If you like alternative music, you will enjoy this CD.
B0030IIZ56|1.0|Incredibly disappointed! No Blue Ray Disc was included-just the DVD. For what I paid-I should have gotten both. I got ripped off!
B009R659L8|4.0|The only problem with this book was I figured out the ending before I read a little over half the book.  But I still very much enjoyed it. I like all of Mary Higgins Clark's books.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I remember as a young girl seeing this 'album' at one of my older sister and her husband's home.  Just recently, I bought this and it brought back good memories.
1400049628|4.0|Really great book, which I'm using much of as a basis for a role playing game (RPG). Focuses on only 1 potential cause of zombies, however, which is a virus. What about nanobots and other potential causes? Of course it's all fiction, but it's a bit narrow for my purposes of an RPG game, or even someone who's simply interested in the subject and would like a more broad approach.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app works great. I have no problems. News feed is right on the dot and navigation is easy and it doesn't lag like I've noticed on the Samsung Galaxy series or IPod touch. I only give 4 stars because the version for iPod touch is slightly better for navigation such as the messaging that shows on little dots at the top which allow for easy navigation between messaging and news feed, and when you're viewing pics you simply swipe up from the bottom of the pic and takes you straight back to the news feed. Facebook for kindle works great and I'm sure it'll get even better. Recommend this app to everyone!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love the Piano Guys and now I can listen whenever I wish to.  Great music set in fantastic locations.  If you haven't watched them do so.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is such a great game that keeps you thinking. 3 levels of difficulty that you play and as you win you unlock the new genes and plagues. The game is very strategic and can get very difficult but the challenge make you wanna try over and over till you're happy with yourself for winning. It's a great challenge game and fun for all ages, particularly those who wanna watch the world crumble xD. Spend the dollar then try unlocking everything by playing. You could simply purchase all the genes and plagues but where's the fun in that? I highly recommend this app to everyone.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Very entertaining.  I read the book several years ago and<br />couldn't wait for the movie.  We need more movies like this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is great (be better if I won jackpot) I'm obsessed with it and when I get coins I smile and laugh..
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is beyond great.  Every person that has a child should watch this movie.  You will learn what you should be doing as parents.  I would reccomend this to everyone.  The vendor was prompt in all the  entire situations was great.<br />Dianne Burnett<br />Goodview, VA

B00BWLKTOS|5.0|This is a compilation of their YouTube stuff. I love it; I listen to it lots of times. Support them, because they're very talented.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great activity to help promote critical thinking skills in young children. My 4 and 8 year old sons take turns playing Where's My Perry. The levels vary enough to keep interest and add just enough difficulty to each level to keep their minds engaged as well as their eyes.

B0040QYROK|4.0|Metropolis surprised me.<br /><br />It surprised me on multiple levels: The Blu-ray restoration gets 5 stars from me. It's clear, bright, crisp, and that incredible score is loud and perfectly restored. Yes, there are scenes (about 20 minutes, in all) that are not restored, but that is because those scenes were not in the almost pristine print found in Argentina in 2008. Metropolis is stunning to watch in Blu-ray, and I urge that you only buy the restored version.<br /><br />The sheer extent of Lang's megalomania astounded me. Thousands of extras, gigantic sets, bombastic scores, broadly sketched characters, and the sheer audacity of the film astounded me. The editing, the special effects (surprisingly good!), the visuals, and the themes were all brilliant, if less psychological than Lang's other works (check out the brilliant \\"[[ASIN:B0023AO5JC M]]\\")<br /><br />It's easy to see the influence: [[ASIN:B0010T0OCY Dark City]] and [[ASIN:B003XURDAY Blade Runner]] draw heavily from this film, and critic Roger Ebert claims Metropolis influenced classics such as The Matrix, Gattaca, Star Wars, and even Dr. Strangelove (the artificial hand, get it?). The theme of a dystopian/utopian city, robots, androids, evil scientists, skyscrapers, gigantic machines, and even the concept of science fiction cinema in general are all explored and birthed in part from Metropolis.<br /><br />Yet it's not perfect. No, not at ALL! What's the word I'm looking for? Cheesy? Goofy? Silly acting? Bad acting? Thin story? One dimensional characters? All of the above can be used to describe Metropolis. While you have to admire the sheer OTT energy that the actors throw into their performances, many times you cannot help but laugh or cringe. The character of Maria is handled particularly poorly, with her evil self raising her thin eyebrows and staring wildly. The only acting I felt was natural was the father's - Joh Fredersen.<br /><br />The story has gigantic holes, namely the fickleness of the crowd at the end, going from happy to angry in a few seconds - following Robot Maria to the bitter end, then denouncing her as a \\"witch\\", burning her at the stake. The plot is very simple - not convoluted or multi-layered. The characters are, by today's standards, somewhat cliched. The evil scientist. The Christ figure. The obviously evil sidekick. Again, the best character in the film is Joh Fredersen. I won't say that this does not detract from the film, because it does.<br /><br />Metropolis would be better viewed as a collection of scenes: The opening scenes of Metropolis. The Changing of the Shifts. The Moloch scene. The Dance of the Seven Veils. The Tower of Babel. The numerous worker scenes. The Creation of Maria. The Flood Sequence (a tad melodramatic, this). Metropolis at night. The Witch Burning Scene.<br />These iconic and utterly brilliant scenes will take your breath away. The sheer scope of the Tower of Babel scene. The look of terror on the protagonist's face as he views a machine as a gigantic monster. The frantic, almost robotic life of the workmen. The creation of Robot Maria - one of cinema's most famous scenes. The moving and brilliant scene where the creator of Metropolis looks out on his glowing city (if you are a lover of sci-fi, this WILL take your breath away). It is, and I say this is in the Shakespearean sense, an awesome film.<br /><br />So that's Metropolis: deeply flawed, but groundbreaking, brilliant, and incredible. A classic.<br /><br />Strong Recommendation. 4.5 Stars.at the end, going from happy to angry in a few seconds - following Robot Maria to the bitter end, then denouncing her as a \\"witch\\", burning her at the stake.

B0051MKNV8|5.0|It is my favorite because I have lived with natural brain enhancement caused by bipolar illness and I know what it feels like to be this way. The actor does a fantastic job of portraying someone in mania, the good kind, and how your brain sped up works. I once tested with an IQ of 225 while manic. Of course I had a great day solving all my problems and anyone elses. But you gotta come down sometime. . . and that's in this movie as well. Watch and enjoy. Now you know what its like to be bipolar or multi-polar as I like to call it.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|I couldn.t get into the hang of this game.  It really didn,t grab my interest. It was a little too involved.
B002436WFI|5.0|(comma) The Lure of the Wyrm, Close to the Edge)(Also available on Amazon books as one book). Anyway, this movie includes famous actors from Lord of the Rings and other movies you may have seen them in. Its quite a hoot. Watching it really improved my week alone while my wife was of at a work training session. This movie also has the flavor of a Terry Gilliam movie(a former Python). Gilliam's movies are also available on Amazon DVD's and probably on Amazon's online content feed system. Enjoy the movie &#34;The Color of Magic&#34;. . .

B005GFPZYK|4.0|A well structured autobiography, of a man doing his job and doing it well. The excerpts from his wife and her take on things will hit home with many that have family in harms way. I was very saddened to hear what happened to Chris while he was trying to help others recover. From his story he is someone I would have loved to share a beer, BBQ and swap a few tales. Rest easy fella

B0035YDM4Y|4.0|A strong novel from a strong man, had me eager to turn the page, it is a roller coaster ride literally
0439023513|1.0|The first book in this series was adequate. Not masterful, but not an unreadable mess. Katniss was a strong-willed character who pushed through great hardship and prevailed. The romantic side bored me, but whatever. The second book was the same. Merely adequate. Mockingjay, however, is just bad. She took the determined, iron-willed teen who had fed her family in a poverty-stricken city for years and turned that powerful person into a crying, whiny, useless child who can't do anything without help or permission. Then Collins kills the only thing holding the boring rag together off, Finnick, along with every slightly interesting character in literally a single chapter. I stopped reading there,because this book is a pile of garbage. Any \\"fans\\" will be disappointed.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|My kids and I have this game on various devices and we all enjoy playing - however, I am about to quit. I am at level 39 and have a ton of coins coming in and being spent, but it is almost impossible to collect a reasonable number of acorns to do anything with. I realize the game makes money by selling acorns, but please Gameloft, make it easier to get acorns. I just played Scrats Game 6 times and got 1 acorn. The game is fun for all, but I give it 4 not 5 because of the lack of a corn rewards.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I share a lot of the criticisms written of by other reviewers but I still needed to know how the story finished. I'm not one of the legions of fans who really thinks the author owes us anything. It was my choice to read all these books. Having done so, I knew not to expect much and in that respect the author delivered.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am so upset with how this book finished a series that I have loved for many years.  This book was so disappointing and I hate the way she ended what originally was my favorite vampire series ever!

B007I2BZIE|5.0|The ticking of the clock, the passage of time, one doesn't know if Rush drummer and lyricist Neal Peart was consumed by his age when writing the lyrics of Clockwork Angels, but one would guess a band in their fourth decade might be pondering if this might be the last time they have to get it right.<br /><br />Peart, Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson have always been known for stretching the boundaries of rock each time they release an album. Therefore on their 20th studio album Clockwork Angels, Rush hasn't necessarily re-invented themselves. Their eclectic hard rock is alive and well as the older the trio get the rawer their music becomes. Starting with Counterparts in the early 90s Rush has crafted some of the most unique heavy hitters on the radio, with tunes such as One Little Victory, Stick It Out and Far Cry all tap dancing a fine line between hard rock and heavy metal, while not being directly tied to either genre. On Caravan, Alex Lifeson's guitar remains front and center bursting off the speaker with as arena ready a guitar riff he's ever played.<br /><br />But in the same way time waits for no man, Rush has never waited for an audience. Starting in the 70s with records such as 2112, the bands best work seems to be focused on what people might be thinking decades from now. As the trio has crafted a number of songs which still seem fresh decades after their first release. When one first heard Tom Sawyer in the mid-80s, a future concert staple of this arena rock bands set-list, most likely thought they were hearing a very weird tune not a future regular play on classic rock radio.<br /><br />On Clockwork Angels one wonders if Peart and company haven't given us another record which along with 2112 and Moving Pictures might be labeled one day as one of the bands' defining works. Set in a future world, the science fiction story told on Clockwork Angels allows the band to craft a corresponding futuristic sounds cape. Adding in some orchestral arrangements to this three piece's already meaty sound Clockwork Angels overwhelms you with a full energy that pummels the ears. BU2B is the best example as this up-tempo blast commenting on the ideas society places in the minds of its citizens takes off like a rocket allowing you to picture the dark future Peart's lyrics paint. Other moments on Clockwork Angels seem just as otherworldly such as the chorus on The Wreckers where the band crafts a catchy chorus out of as paranoid a take on life one might hear. In the same way Tom Sawyer revealed itself to be a good weird tune Clockwork Angels is filled with moments that feel like good weird tunes that might just take a little time to get used to.<br /><br />On Clockwork Angels it appears the trio has for maybe one last time, gotten it right.piece's already meaty sound Clockwork Angels overwhelms you with a full energy that pummels the ears.

193700788X|1.0|I have read and loved the SVM for some time now.<br />I have looked forward to Sookie's adventures and romances with eager anticipation.<br />Charlaine Harris created a world of jump off the page characters and exciting plot lines<br />as well a hot, steamy romance that defied boundaries<br />and hopefully would defy odds.............................then she ripped the world to pieces and stomped on it.<br /><br />Possible spoilers ahead.<br /><br />Sookie has become unrecognizable as the sweet, brave narrator of the early books.<br />She has become narrow-minded and bigoted. The other characters don't fare much better.<br /><br />Many questions have been left unanswered and loose ends left loose.<br />You will need the coda, I guess.<br /><br />If you don't like the end it's your fault.<br />You must be an entitled reader.<br />It can't possibly be because the grand finale makes no sense,is poorly written and the hea<br />is entirely out of left field. Again, your fault if you missed all the obvious (sarcasm) clues in the last 12 books<br />while you were listening to the narrator instead<br /><br />************major spoilers****************<br /><br />Eric, the pragmatic, freedom-loving former viking is vampire-trafficked to Oklahoma by his maker. He gives up all that he loves and sacrifices an additional 100 years for his Sookie. Meanwhile, our flighty heroine is off in la-la land having some grotesquely described ick time with Sam and then she and Dean(oops, Sam)go line-dancing. She could have at least written a thank-you note to Eric, but in her defense she was kidnapped for the (?)11th time. She really needs to remove the sign from her back that says \\"kidnap me! I'm Sookie Stackhouse\\".<br /><br />Formulaic much?<br /><br />At least no Pelts show up.<br /><br />Claude the fairy is killed by a bullet from a gun.  Think about it.  Only one of many, many inconsistencies from previous books.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love this case so much!  It keeps my headset safe (which would be worth a lot) and means that I don't have to think about charging very often at all!  I don't use my headset all that much -- say, 3 - 10 hours a week -- and I can go for many weeks without recharging the case.  It also doesn't take very long to recharge.  I can't say how long a more frequent user could go between charges.  It's sturdy, lightweight, and compact.
1932100660|5.0|wow! all the things you don't know! This is really a must read. But its more than that. a must read and a must apply. The explanations are not simplistic by any means but they are simple. It makes perfect sense and it has the singular ring of truth. Is it hard to apply. Maybe. But anything worthwhile requires effort. This will give you the motivation to get started.

B00001OH7N|5.0|I had this album for Decades on vinyl. Completely different album cover. over the years it developed to many scratches and became impossible to enjoy. The interesting thing about David has to do with his first 4 albums. His first was &#34;Space Odditty&#34;, 1969. This album had a mellower sound to it. (The Title track wasn't released as a single in America until 1973.) With his second Album (This one) , 1970 ,He (with the help of Mick Ronson) had more of a Heavy Metal sound to it. Then his third Album &#34;Hunky Dory&#34;, 1971 (most remembered for the song, &#34;Changes&#34;) went back down to the &#34;Quiter side&#34; (with the exception of &#34;Queen Bitch&#34;  Then Finally in 1972 he came out with his all time classic &#34;Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&#34; Once again he went back to the Heavier sound. It was Both an ASS Kicker and a mind Blower as well. But, getting back to &#34;The Man Who Sold The World&#34;, definately a &#34;10&#34; on a scale of........
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was better than book one.  Read the series and if you get past book one it gets better reading.
B00005K9QP|5.0|This is Eric Clapton at his best. He is using the same rig that he used with Cream: the SG shaped Les Paul and the Marshall, and playing with an excellent blues band. But it is from just before Cream was formed! This album has absolutely the best version of Hideaway that there is!!!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I had these earphone for many many years. I have never liked the earbuds type of head phones as they fall off  constantly.<br />When my old ones broke, I went to Best Buy and decided to get an upgrade for ear phones. I purchased ones that were around $80. They were very similar to the Sony Ultra Lightweight. They sucked as they made my ears hurt so bad!<br /><br />So, I went on Amazon and purchased my old ones and I LOVE THEM!!! They are flexible, and perfectly fit my small ears! I took these on the plane and they were so comfy that I even fell asleep with them!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these ear phones to anyone.

B0030V0PEW|4.0|I did not expect to enjoy this book half as much as I did - what on earth is interesting about a checklist of all things? But it was fascinating to read how checklists in several fields have evolved and the astonishing lengths gone to in order to get them right. Very well written and REALLY interesting. I am not a big nonfiction fan but the personal narrative of this made it incredibly compelling.
0446613444|5.0|It kept my interest and that's what makes a good book for me. I have read many of Tony's books and always enjoy them.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I was expecting this to be a book about a Navy SEAL.  Instead, it was a book about an incredible man who happened to be a SEAL.  This was unexpected but definitely worth the read.<br /><br />If you're looking for detailed descriptions of battles and firefights, you won't find it here.  But if that is really what you're looking for, you should give this book a read for a change of pace.  While I won't say this story will \\"change my life\\", it is certainly a great story.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Others have written about the soundtrack, japanese version vs US version, etc, etc, etc... None of that mattered to me. I saw Ponyo with my two year old baby and we both loved every minute of it. The story is sweet... The movie is engaging not because it is fast paced but because the story is engaging, the animation is beautiful, the colors are amazing, the music is lovely... Technicalities probably matter to some, but to me, watching a movie that is so beautifully presented with a story that is so sweet at heart is all and more that I could have asked for. I can't wait to get My Neighbor Totoro in its Blu-ray version later on this month!
B004H4XDBI|5.0|This book as well as the first are very easy reads and the author really draws you into the book. You find yourself rooting for the characters and not wanting to stop reading it until you reach the end. So great...a definite read
B001AQT0RC|5.0|If you buy this movie (at least to me they did), Amazon will allow you to see it via Instant video for like a month. I have trouble thinking of someone who would watch it streaming-quality with the time limit pressure, after buying it in the highest quality available. I would have preferred a digital version of the book. Amazon, you listening?, digital book!!!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I like the explanations about what make some us introvert or extrovert.<br />I just don't like the advice to act like an extrovert that she insists in recommending. Extrovert got to be extrovert at all time, why I cannot be introvert at all times. I am not denying the fact we are living in a civilization that favors the extrovert way; but pretending to be one even for a good cause is hypocritical and kind of self degrading. It is like saying the extrovert way is indeed the best. I am not a sellout. Nature makes us this way for a purpose, and I am sure we can find our way to impact this world and be happy by staying true to ourselves.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|I loved this show when it was on MTV.  I am glad to own the whole tv series.  Anyone who enjoyed Daria.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I just finished reading this book, and WOW. What a way to throw a hand grenade into the most successful series of your career, CH. Great job. I won't give spoilers, but let me just say that this whole book left me completely confused as to why we read the previous 12. With more than one of the characters, she completely decimated the character developments she nurtured throughout this series just to have the ability to wrap the series up with, as it seemed to me, the least amount of effort. Her writing seemed to show little love or interest in some of the most dynamic and spell binding characters she has ever written into existence. The HEA was also lacking. It's amazing how Sookie could jump from one love interest to another so fast, or maybe that was just because CH was close to meeting her page quota for this lackluster effort. There were times I felt like I wasn't even reading CH's writing, as if she actually hired a ghost writer to finish this final book in a series that up until this book, I loved. What a total disappointment. I really wish I had stopped at book 12. Maybe I would still have respect for CH as a writer if I did...BTW does anyone else think she could have made Sookie immortal without turning her vampire? What about the hug Niall gave her that sent a &#34;jolt&#34; through her body and also made her garden bionic? Couldn't that have been his final departing gift to her? To make her immortal without the negatives of being a vamp? The nasty tendency to drain family and loved ones of blood and the lack of sun seemed to be the detractor, right? Perfect solution, right?
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It's very nice and well written. I like the different povs we get to see and I'd definitely recommend it to kids around 9-13 or so but there's really no age limit to liking this book, as long as you like this type of humor.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Great movie to share with family and friends, and a jewel to have on hand to watch anytime! Great cast of characters. Enjoy!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|For a young adult book this series is really good! The author does a wonderful job of painting a vivid picture!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It's the last book.  I am not going to give a series that i have spent the last 10 years of my life reading anything less than five stars.  I don't even know why I am leaving a review, by this point you already know whether or not you are going to be buying this book.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I JUST DON'T KNOW..... I have read this series for years ... The last one and this one were not what I expected, or how I wanted to end. But I do see and understand how it did.. Sookie Stackhouse I will miss you.... I have loved theses novels and am sad there will be no more.
B001S384HY|5.0|The Audio of Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is extremely entertaining while giving you a view of how important it is to think like successful people do. Harv's comparison on how the different people think based on where they are financially was very insightful and unfortunately hit very close to home. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is striving to change the way you think about money or your current lack of.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A touching novel about two young teenagers suffering from the side effects of dying..cancer..Love, tragedy, spirit, and charisma . Makes you reflect back on your own life and value and cherish what you have and how lucky you truly are. Recommended for anyone who will take the time to truly read and understand the hardships and sincerity of this novel which is brilliantly written.
B002DMJLTE|5.0|I love a good science fiction movie where the earth is destroyed (or nearly destroyed), and Deep Impact is one that is both entertaining AND family friendly.  Deep impact is not perfect, and not nearly as well directed as &#34;Armageddon&#34;, but it is still a fantastic movie that I highly recommend.  It makes for great movie night with family and friends!
193700788X|1.0|I wish I hadn't read it. It would have been better to not have any closure or ending than this cluster****!

0790729652|3.0|The product description said it was a used DVD but there was a scratch on it that made the movie skip a few minutes of the movie.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book was excellent. It met all my expectations. I bought this book because of some troubles at the library. So I experimented with getting e-books. It worked out perfectly. I didn't have to struggle for the light. It was also bigger and in smaller segments, making it easy to read. This book is also very good. It includes all of our friends, and is full of cliff hangars, and surprises. I really enjoy reading, as I f let included in the suspenseful action. I would recommend this book to a friend. 5 stars!!!!! You should read this book (after you read the others of course) -M
0452289963|5.0|This was a very absorbing reading, I couldn't put it down. It's accessible, in-depth, and strongly inspirational. It spoke to me on a very deep level, and the things I've taken from this book will keep with me forever :) I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I got this app because I enjoyed DH3. However, this went above and beyond. Whereas DH3 was a dungeon crawler game with good graphics and a good gear selection in the shop, DH4 is a legit RPG with even better grapics. A quick runover: Start by choosing a character class. There are four to chose from: Battleworn (basic warrior), Blademaster (basic assassin), Warmage (basic mage), Sentinel (basic ranger). You can choose any class as well as gender. You then choose your name. A clip then plays that reveals the first part of the story. Then play through a tutorial level. Eventually, you play the game. While the shop is fairly limited (on the gold side), the crafting system lets you create much better gear than is available for non-paying players. Any gear can have three charms inserted in order to increase performance. Also, using a facebook or gameloft live account, you can log in and play multiplayer, which is available on certain maps unlocked throughout single player, as well as two pvp modes in an arena that everyone gets automatically.
193700788X|2.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I too have been a fan since the beginning. I eagerly await each new book to come out and purchase it the day it is released. I make sure I have time to both devour and savor the book. I love immersing myself in the world that Charlaine Harris has created. I also haven't always agreed with the negative reviews of the most recent books. In creating such a world there are always details that may slip by the editors and the writer. I've chosen not to judge those oversights and enjoy the book for what it is. However, I was terribly disappointed with the final book of the series.<br /><br />SPOILERS!<br />As I began reading the final book, I couldn't imagine how Harris could create a final book that was worthy of the wonderful series she has created. As it turned out, she hadn't. Her choice to have Sam as the one was Sookie ends up with was not who I would have chosen. They are her characters and this was the vision she had for Sookie. When you see someone nearly die, or in Sam's case, actually die, it can awaken feelings that you didn't realize you had buried so deeply.<br /><br />I've also always enjoyed Harris' use of Sookie's day to day life to endear her to us. Who doesn't appreciate someone enjoying baking in the sun or taking pleasure enjoying a new outfit, but in her final book I was hoping for a little more. I wasn't thrilled reading about a shopping excursion between Sookie and Tara. The true failure of the book comes from the ending.  Harris ties everything up in a nice little bow, but there is no resolution.  Sookie has been through huge life changing experiences, yet she really hasn't \\"learned\\" anything.  She hasn't developed from her life experiences. Sookie is still a waitress, with a little more money. I think that Harris is a wonderful writer, but she didn't do any justice to herself or Sookie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this game it's really really fun, everyone has to play this fun game that's like temple run well you'll just have to find out! :)
B00005RIKI|5.0|great record but for the lousy added un-needed bonus tracks. with out a doubt one of the best albums from them and a must have for any fan or someone just tryin to get into them. al kooper hit the mark on production & the band hit the mark on the performing and writing.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|After reading Goodwin's Team of Rivals, I gained a much greater appreciation of the type of leader that Lincoln was, and all that he brought to the Presidency. While being a history buff, I didn't care as much for Civil War history, but this book made me think about it in a new light. The humor that Lincoln brought to all situations is enlightening, and in these current times, I wish we had leaders with half of his ability. I was also fascinated by William Seward in the book. Unfortunately, Chase left me cold, but the interweaving of the stories of these men was a compelling read.
B00004W510|5.0|here is thier finest work from the studio and worth every fan and collector having in thier collection. no stinkers on this except the lousy un needed bonus tracks. would b nice if records reissued were the original record. but a must have if a band fan.
B0076DELIG|3.0|This started out as little slow and dry at first. But did pick up the pace into a good story. I don't think this is one of Connellys best but still it was a great entertaining story.
B004ZJZQHE|5.0|It seems that SCARFACE will always be the De Palma film that stands out the most, but CARLITO'S WAY is the more refined achievement, a surprisingly tender and humane gangster tragedy which only competes with ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA for a combination of formal elegance and pathos.
B009NY43NY|4.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />I for one was profoundly gratified by the ending of this book and series. I love Sookie and have always thought she deserved better than a vampire boyfriend who could never truly love her or give her the full, human life that she so clearly longs for and will be so good at. She will be a great mother and wife to man who is 1) her best friend 2) respects her autonomy and 3) a person with whom she has plenty of passion. I've been waiting through all these books for her to realize that this is the right guy for her. Why is staying in her home town and the community that clearly means so much to her somehow \\"settling for less\\"? Whatever gave anyone the impression that she wanted anything else but to be accepted there? I like how all the characters' stories are wound up. As I see it, everyone gets the life they've chosen for themselves, which to me is very true to the real world.<br /><br />It's not very true to romance fiction, though, and I think that's the problem for some fans of the series. Let's face it: Romance novels are all about telling you that some powerful, sexy alpha male like Eric will be transformed into a faithful, devoted life partner no matter how much he's catted around in the past, soon as he meets the \\"right woman.\\" This is a LIE. CH is true to the reality that any guy like that is NEVER going to make his partner and family a priority over his own needs and desires. Wake the f up ladies! Eric is selfish and domineering and Sookie deserves better than that. And let me tell you, the world and society would be much, much better if women stopped kidding themselves that guys like this can be reformed. Yes, they can be sexy, and maybe some of us can have fun with them before getting out while the getting is good, but SO much female misery is caused by the delusion that they will be magically made into decent men by true lurve.<br /><br />I think most women who read romance fiction know this on some level, but the books are fun, temporary fantasy that goes against what any non-deluded woman knows to be the reality of men and our relationships to them. It's an outlet for our bad-boy fantasies. The thing is, after so many books, Sookie has come to seem so real to me that if she ended up with one of these fake romance novel heroes, I would feel horribly betrayed. She's not some flimsy romance heroine hitching up with a duke or billionaire. I want to say good-bye to her knowing that she's on the road to real happiness, not an HEA. And that's why I loved this book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game great graphics from front to back., game is simply delightful. very good to pass time well worth the money.

0920668372|5.0|Adults cry when they read this book (everyone I know says that!), but for kids it is so very comforting.  The story is quite simple and very moving.  My daughter always challenges me to read it without crying.  It took me several read-throughs in private, but I can do it.  I once used the book as part of a sermon (I am reverend clergy), and there was not a dry eye in the house.  Afterwards, there was a run on the book  at several local stores.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I have heard this music for years but this album is different because non professional singers are doing the singing and it makes it all more real for me. Love it!!
193700788X|5.0|With all the controversy, I was quite nervous while reading the book. I wanted to take my time, and enjoy my last venture into Sookie-land. I have enjoyed living there every time a new book came out. However, with all the spoilers popping up I felt I needed to hurry through this one. I want to thank Ms. Harris for pouring her heart and soul into the books, and for sharing these stories with us. They have truly enraptured me over the years. This one was no exception. It was a beautifully written book, and you could tell, once again, she had poured her heart and soul into it. This story takes you on a journey, it pulls at your heart strings, makes you cry, makes you laugh, and makes you scream. It does everything all the Sookie books do. It is wonderful. Buy it. Read it. Enjoy it. Live in Sookie's world one more time. I'm going to read it again, now, and this time very slowly.

0486409511|5.0|I am in the process of studying Calligraphy and Copperplate. I had just purchased this book as one of my reference books. So far it seams to be a Great book and I am very glad I bought it. When I purchased a \\"Dip Pen set\\", this is the only book that they offered with their kit, but I had already purchased it from Amazon.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|So, first of all I'm perplexed by all the reviews by people who say they're tired of Joe's sound.  They also say, it's the same old thing.  Are we listening to the same album?  Sounds like some pre-programming of your brain took place before you listened.<br /><br />This album is very different from most of Joe's other albums.  Yet, it's a great album.  What I think is happening is that Joe keeps meeting people's expectations, and they find that boring.  \\"Ohhhh, another great Satriani album...booooooorrrring.\\"<br /><br />I think what they'd prefer is for him to change his style of dress, or grow his hair in again...<br /><br />Most annoying is all this pinning for Guthrie Govan I keep hearing.  It's pretentious nonsense.  If you want to listen to G.G. then by all means go ahead.  What's that got to do with Joe?<br /><br />Here's the deal.  I would have rated this CD a 3 out of 5 the first time or two I listened to it.  The third time I listened...it got up to a 4.  After the 5th or 6th time, this album is approaching 5 for me!<br /><br />Like a lot of great music, it requires patience and repeated listening; cause there's too much to get in one pass.<br /><br />To all of you who just need the next new thing all the time: Watch \\"The Voice\\".

B00AEQYM6S|5.0|You need to like Wagner, (and you probably wouldn't be reading this if you didn't) and you need to be curious about a singer who is getting so much praise.  That's me.  Wagner is hard work.  Especially for tenors.  Not many have the equipment to sing his music.  This man has the equipment.  Powerful one moment, lyrical the next, soaring and ecstatic or subdued and reflective, he is totally believable, always just right.  He also seems to have good sense about what he will sing and what he will not.  May his career go on forever.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|This program is fast enough to navigate my desktop and manipulate most programs.  Video doesn't keep up, but that may be device dependent.  I have an HTC One (the new One) Phablet and get by.  The Galaxy Note II does fine too, but any smaller screen and the program loses value.  I recommend this for your tablet.<br /><br />Just think of how great it is to be able to move files to your Dropbox, Evernote, etc. when you're away from home!  Jump does the trick.  I purchased this during the Amazon Free App of the Day listing- GREAT PRICE!

193700788X|1.0|I was SO excited to get this book.  I stayed away from the spoilers and instead read it in nearly one sitting on my Kindle on release day.<br />My first impression- did CH even write this? The characters seemed \\"off.\\"  But I kept reading, blaming it on the fact that I hadn't read any CH books in months.  I didn't care for the different POVs in this book, since NONE of the other 12 used it.  And I certainly didn't need the POV from fringe characters.  How about one from, oh, I don't know, ERIC?!  Considering how many books were spent on their relationship (and all its ups and downs) I think he deserved more than a few pages in this one.<br />As for the HEA that the fans are crying over (either in revolt by the ELs or in \\"haha- screw you guys too!\\" by the BLs) I think it was pretty obvious by book 12 that it was going to be Sam.  I don't like it and I don't buy it, but since Sookie has been the master rebounder for most of the series, I am sure her days with Sam are probably numbered as well.<br />As for CH, it is such a shame that she is turning on the fans who have literally made her career.  Its a shame that she has such thin skin over the criticism that this book it rightly given.  Its poorly written, the plotlines are numerous, highly underdeveloped but quickly resolved (Shades of EL James here).  For the thousands that are crying that they hate the book because of the whole Sam v Eric thing, there are thousands more who crying because it is such a poor novel.<br />Prior to actually reading this book, I had considered getting After Dead when it is released later this fall.  Now, I will not give CH or her publishing house the satisfaction or one more cent of my money.

What I do know is that I've been breathless and restless and engaged and have laughed and shuddered and loved the Sookie Stackhouse series. I'm sad there are no more books coming. It ended on a high note, and the end was mostly satisfying, and for that I'm grateful.

B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|It took me a while to write a review on this app. I wanted to play it for a bit so that I could give it a fair review. First off... Its free. So that's a big plus. They have made some good changes in this sequel. I found it fun and a little bit addicting. LOL. The only thing that really bugged me about the app is the multi-player section. People way above your level can challenge you and obviously beat your very easily. Other than that... the levels are fun, and the game is a must play.

0670014893|2.0|I wish I was intelligent enough to understand what the hell this book is supposed to be about, but is was impossible for me to follow. I gave up about 1/3 of the way through. It seems to make sense to the other reviewers, but if you like the espionage of Olin Steinhauer, you're going to hate this. You may hate it even if you like Le Carre. I gave it 2 stars because I loved all of his earlier work, and guess I am just not sophisticated enough to appreciate this book. But really, life is too short to struggle with something you just don't like.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|Ok so I love Avatar and having all these versions and extra features in one place is awesome. My only complaint is that the broke up all versions of the movie onto 2 discs. Why not put them on their own discs and spread out the special features. It's a little annoying to have to put in another disk half way through the movie.

B0067AC5KA|5.0|Who wants to read a book about a tattooed girl despite the positive reviews from friends and family?  Well, after much urging from people who's opinions I trust, apparently I did and so finally read &#34;The Girl...&#34;  I can't tell you how happy I am that I did!  It's not just about a tattooed girl, it's about so much more:  bravery, courage, friendship. loyalty, love, loss, betrayal, and more.  It is an amazing story in trilogy form that stays true to itself from beginning to end and doesn't disappoint.  I was quite sad when I finished as there is nothing more coming from this author, but I highly recommend you read it.  And do yourself a favor, save yourself the anguish of not having the second one waiting when you finish with the first or the third one waiting when you finish the 2nd and buy the trilogy from the beginning.  You'll be glad you did.  Go ahead, enjoy yourself!

B004JRVQX0|1.0|I'm running a W7 Home Premium laptop. Bought a copy of Synthogy's Ivory Grand Pianos II and was forced to buy this alongside it. I've now spent more than 9 hours in front of my computer today due to the fact that the drivers and client programs iLok provides on their website will not install properly on my system, which makes my purchase of over $500 of Ivory products completely unusable. Ever email sent between iLok support is shorter and shorter and I don't forsee them fixing the problem. I've even gone as far as to try the install on another laptop and had the same results. This product is garbage, and because of it. I've got a $500 paperweight sitting on my desk. Words cannot describe how disappointed and downright angry I am.

193700788X|1.0|This was the biggest let-down I've ever had from a book.  It was obvious that she just wanted to be up and done with the series.  But, WOW.  What a shame.  To have so much talent and creativity for the Bon Temps world she created to only have it end like this.  While I do enjoy it, I can't say I am a die-hard fan of the TV show like I was for the books.  But I will certainly start watching since the show hasn't stayed TOO close to the script of the books....it seems like our only hope now is that writers would want to make their fans happy and give us the ending we deserve instead of this junk.  Just horrible.

B00BIVN82M|1.0|I haven't been this disappointed with an album in such a long time!!!! I am such a huge Michael Buble fan, but what was he doing with this album?! Trying new methods/sounds is great, but this method is not working on this album. I listen to this album straight several times over the two week period. It still haven't grown on me, I've just grown more disappointed.<br /><br />I've read in a recent interview that he believe this was the best album he's made. I know he is in a different space now that he is becoming a parent, etc. But what was Michael thinking? The duet with Reese was pretty bad and he doesn't have enough originals!! Why can't Michael create more original sounds instead of doing over other artists songs? I find his originals are always consistently great, that's how I became a fans-by his own music he created. Songs he covered from previous albums had better production to them.<br /><br />This album will not get much listen from me. I'm going have to stick to Crazy Love/Hollywood Delux and Call Me Irresponsible as a constant replay on my musical devices.<br /><br />Songs such as  \\"End of May\\" \\"Cry Me a River\\", \\" Hold On\\", \\"Best of Me\\",\\" Your Nobody Till somebody loves you\\", and \\"Lost\\". Those are the songs that Michael can make a person feel a certain way when listening to them.<br /><br />We'll see what he does with the next one...<br /><br />On a lighter note, I'm looking forward to his concert this coming September! :)<br /><br />Update 6/3/2013: After listening to this ablum songs again (I want to really give this album a chance).<br /><br />Only two songs grew on me:<br />After All Ft. Bryan Adams; and<br />Close Your Eyes.<br /><br />I still feel the same way about this album, its my least favorite and not his best effort. However, the two songs I mentioned above are exceptions. They are good songs- not great.

0062014536|1.0|Delirium and Pandemonium were both great reads. I was anxiously waiting for Requiem. This book started off ok, but then towards the end just fell apart. I mean the whole Alex, Julian, Lena triangle just well short. Alex was mute throughout the book. Ignoring Lena, getting a new girlfriend... Then suddenly he's beating up Julian and then runs away, leaving Lena a cryptic note that she has to figure out. Not understanding him at all. Lena's in love with Alex, pushes Julian away for Alex; only to go running into his arms as soon as Alex leaves.  Lena was just all over the place.<br /><br />I love adding in Hana's story, but then that fell short too. The way she was feeling so guilty and wanting to help Lena and her family I thought she'd want to run away with Lena; get away from the controlling life she was starting to have. I guess she got her wish with making sure Fred stayed in the house, but her ending just felt flighty.<br /><br />Moving on to the end... What the heck! There's this big build up, with the war, the resistance, Lena, Julian and Alex. And then it ends with the people tearing down the wall to Portland. I mean come on now, Portland was just one tiny city. What does this mean for the resistance? Lena spent days leading up to the fight with Julian and \\"loving\\" him. The happiest she's ever been. Then the day before the battle she suddenly ignores him and treats him like he's nothing. I feel so bad for Julian in this book. Its one thing to give someone space and time to figure things out. He was great with that, but then enough is enough.  He was so strong in Pandemonium and looked to be building his life in the Wilds. Lena just made him out to be a sucker.<br /><br />I'm not happy at all with this book. If I knew there was a fourth book coming then it would be different. At least I'd feel that the story was going to come to a conclusion. Alex saying to Lena in the end I love you and I'll find you. Lena saying I've never stopped loving you... Is that all we get from their romance? Didn't there \\"love\\" deserve better than no attention at all in the third book and a tiny \\"I'll always love you\\" speech in the end. Arrggg!!! Stupid, stupid ending to a good story. I mean I was thinking I must have gotten a bad book. I'm missing at least another chapter in the end. It just can't end like this. But yeah it does... I feel so let down.get from their romance? Didn't there \\"love\\" deserve better than no attention at all in the third book and a tiny \\"I'll always love you\\" speech in the end. Arrggg!!!

0316228532|5.0|I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, but was ready for this book to be nothing like it.  One thing that is consistent is JK Rowling's beautiful writing, ability to weave a complex story and insight into human nature.  Unlike Harry, The Casual Vacancy is about as close to reality as one could hope in a work of fiction.  Be ready, this book has swearing, sex and ugliness, but not without purpose.  Superficially, the book is about the vacuum left in the townspeople's lives when a relatively young town councillor suddenly dies.  More profoundly, the book is about how people affect one another, sometimes for good, sometimes for bad.  Many of the scenes are painfully sad because they are so honest.  But I did not find this book entirely depressing.  I found it inspiring in that it made me appreciate the good in my life, reaffirming how important it is for each one of us to notice one another and try to care as best we can.<br />As for complaints that there are too many characters, there are many great books with a lot of characters.  Give the book some time, and you'll eventually remember exactly who everyone is and want to know where their story is going (and how they are connected).<br />I really hope Rowling writes more books and isn't put out by the negative reviews readers have had of this one.  She's truly a gifted writer!

1878424319|5.0|I have been hearing about this book for a while and have been wanting to purchase it for quite some time.  When I did, I don't know why I didn't make this purchase sooner.  Regardless of when it was written it seems to transcend and relate to todays times.  That's what I loved about the book.  I was going through a rough patch in my life and this book helped me help myself.  The teachings are very simple. Somewhat repetative, but it's worth it!  Even though change doesn't happen over night, in time with proper meditation and usage of these four agreements in your everyday life, you'll see positive change in no time at all.  I followed these agreements and I am very happy with myself and the here and now.  It's worth the read for those who are open minded for positive metamorphosis in their lives.  I highly recommend it!

0812973992|5.0|In a work of fiction marvelously engulfing the 1974 World Trade Center Towers tightrope walk by Frenchman Philippe Petit, Colum McCann profoundly embraces the core of humanistic existence by linking several seemingly obscure characters into one very touching and literarily cohesive unit with \\"Let The Great World Spin.\\" With great care and precision, McCann unpacks each character's story with such erudite grace and detail while centering each, in one way or another, around this historic event. I found myself again and again amazed at the fluidity of his writing and character depiction while following the plot to a rather forlorn conclusion.<br /><br />We're introduced to New York City circa 1974, mainly in Manhattan and the Bronx, peopled with characters as diverse and interesting as a reluctant Irish monk and the throng of prostitutes that he attempts to protect. We also follow the story of a group of middle-age women whose main hostess has a rather disgruntled local judge for a husband. We meet hippie artists and telephone hackers and, my favorite, a subway rider whose main purpose is to search out the new \\"tags\\" and \\"blowups\\" in the subway terminals that the local graffiti artists have rendered.<br /><br />All of these seemingly disparate people are connected to the tightrope walker and McCann's ability to dissect their lives, for all their banality, is only overshadowed by the strength of tone he presents. His writing is lyrical when required and profoundly \\"street\\" at others...an amazing contrast. And, antipathetic to most character driven narratives, this work comes with a strong plot that reaches a heartfelt and sad conclusion. There were episodes within this work that bore reading over and over...the writing and structure are that good.<br /><br />The winner of the 2009 National Book Award, Colum McCann cements his literary reputation with this gem. This will certainly not be the last work of his that I will read.m. This will certainly not be the last work of his that I will read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wonderful story line. Well thought out. Detailed with precision. A definite good read. I love the series so far. Can't wait for the next book.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Not a bad game<br />Expected less flying a round and more fighting and stuff like that<br />But still not bad and also it's very addictive
B00782O7IY|5.0|Agreed with every award it won. I may be biased since my friend from Jr College was the assistant costume designer on this but it held it's own without her. She said they were the most wonderful crew/staff/people she's ever worked with - completely into making this film the best it could be & it was!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The writing style drove me away from long sessions. Too much jumping around in time for my taste. But again each piece interesting to learn from.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|I love this film. I didn't know anything about it at the theatre I entered by accident but it kept me in my seat (actually, on the edge) the entire time. I had thought about finding the show I went to see but can't even remember what it was I was so taken by this one. Can't say enough - surprises around every turn, plenty of suspense & twists & great humor.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Easy to carry... Plenty of room for all of my equipment. Quick Delivery as well. I looked at a lot of other bags. Very pleased!
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|I really enjoyed this game, its simple but still engaging, reminds me of doodle jump with a creative spin. Unfortunately they track everything on your phone with flurry and no amount of fun is worth your privacy. I got this one for free and would be enraged if I had bought it for $1 since I would soon be uninstalling it asap once I found their little secret.<br /><br />4 stars for fun, minus all those stars for deceit.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Wow, such a good series! Just can't believe how the shot some of this! I am still re-watching this 3 yrs later!
0345525558|5.0|The story grabbed me from the get go and never let go.  Fascinating story and characters.  Everyone rings true.  Has a positive ending without a sappy resolution.  Learned a lot about flowers, although that is not the heart of the story.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Got this in record time, as usual!  This is a very good sequel and I can't wait to see Iron Man 3.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Easy to play, easy to earn stars to level up. A fun game you can play with A few minutes of spare time.
B000VE439Y|5.0|This movie is funny and irreverent in the typical style of the Monty Python boys.  With send ups of  the crucifixion; which actually is serious and with the way the boys play the parts; it's a very twisted, but in a good way movie.  Word of warning; there are some \\"naughty bits\\", male and female, exposed, but they're pretty brief. (No pun intended.)  The catchy \\"Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life\\" is particularly wicked.  The second disc features a few deleted scenes and other extras that aren't bad.  I'd like to look into getting the \\"Holy Grail\\" movie, and after I send this review, putting it on the wish list.  For anyone who loves the series, I did, this is a helluva funny movie.
B00000JPH6|5.0|The world may have judged the Muppets as Jim Henson's greatest creation.  Ms Piggy would certainly vote for this, but I feel that the moldy oldy flick Dark Crystal was is magnum opus.  It was WAY before its time, and, frankly, Hollywood did not appreciate it at the time.<br />To use small puppets and large human sized puppets was not only spectacular but it was unique.  The story weaves the tale of the ages and we are now living it.  I cherish this film, and it should be part of the pantheon of anyone's collector flicks.  Bravo Jim and Bravo Frank Oz.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I was thrilled when I saw Nemo's  Reef available in the App store. My husband and I both have Nemo on our Droid Razrs. We have so much fun with this &quot;game&quot;. So when we got our Fires I looked for the app for them. No such luck, until last week when I saw Nemo as # 4 in the app store. The graphics are lovely, the music soothing. Very Zen for me. I really like the &quot;signature&quot; of the game creator: all the fish periodically do a little pirouette. Love, love, love Nemo's Reef. Keep up the good work. We are all so sick of violent games. Wonderful change of pace.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Frankly, I gave up half way through.  too serpentine.  It jusn't wasn't interesting.  seven more words? I'd pass on it.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Perfect condition, played perfect..Love the series it's a great season if you haven't watched it before.  I couldn't be more happy.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I have watched Argo 4 times, and still would watch it again.  It is an important movie of our time, and those of us who lived through it historically are still in awe at the untold stories that evolved during that time.  The ensemble was spectacular and there was an amazing cadence to the entire thing that kept you on the edge til far beyond the credits.  Amazing.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I enjoy all of these books. However, they seem to get less somehow. I liked the beginning ones tat had more story and took longer to read. This was over too soon to be a great read.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love the game! Very addicting! Holds your attention and would be educational for younger kids. Excellent for both adults and children.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This is the first book by this author that I have read and I place it very high on my list which is 77 years long. This work rates with Kate Atkinson which I think is high praise indeed and goes back to the storytelling of such great writers as Dickens and Neville Shute.I love a good story.[[ASIN:B00AEZZZF6 A Town Like Alice]]
B00969PR18|1.0|This program crashed my Kindle multiple times. If I had paid for it, I would have asked for a refund. As if was free, I guess one gets what one pays for!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is really fun if you like temple run get this it's worth it! I hope you make a temple run 3 with new obstacles but still the same quality. This game is challenging, fun, and AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!
B009LGO88E|5.0|Love the circle pad pro! yes it will make ur 3ds xl even more massive but it works perfectly for monster hunter ultimate!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Glad to see that the \\" Hobbit\\" which preferred the lord of the rings trilogy is finally being dusted off!.<br />Without the story we are now getting a peek of.....the trilogy means half what it deserves at. Best.<br />I predict three parts ro \\"the hobbit\\". We've seen one so far....hope they made em all so we don't have to wait forever again.....<br />After all patience is one thing. But enough is enough.<br />Whoever is the brainchild of \\"the hobbit. An unexpected journey \\". I say chaos to you.<br />I want more...and you know which has been left out.....as. many of us do...Im sure all lord of the rings fans will agree.<br />Bob
B005LAJ1HW|3.0|What happened to this show? It started out so interesting. The whole prohibition timeline, criminals making money from illegal booze, and normal law abiding people drinking anyways. It had some great things it could do with the Italian mafia and all the other groups that blew up during that time.<br /><br />But it kind of turned away from what it originally, I felt, was going to be about. It became more of a who is with who relationship show. It also became more violent, maybe to make up for the lack of action / movement, and some of the characters started feeling shallow.<br /><br />I don't think I can recommend this show anymore.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|What a mafia movie should be about! You will be rooting for the underdog. You can't help but love it!
B005LAII80|5.0|I think the subject says it all. If you are into the older just straight up action movies (Commando, Predator, etc.) then this is a movie you'll enjoy. There isn't any overly deep character development. And fortunately it is missing a lot of those really tired current action film trends (Super shaky camera shots, terrible jokes, bad acting). It really is just a fun action movie. Dredd, although I have never really learned anything about the character outside of the first movie and this one, is an interesting character. The story and the environment is really cool if you like the whole run down future kind of thing. It's more believable than the Stallone one, a more gritty nasty future with people living in these overcrowded apartment complex's which is where most of the movie takes place.<br /><br />What this movie suffered from is abysmal marketing. The company that was hired to market this should be really disappointed in their treatment of this film. They overhyped the 3D, and under advertised the great action and interesting setting.<br /><br />This movie, sadly, will probably not get a sequel as the it did not make a great amount of money. But do this film justice, buy the Blu-Ray and enjoy some great action, and great special effects.
B005FITIDC|5.0|This movie was exceptionally acted. It is worth what you pay for it! You will not regret buying this movie!
B009O2XY12|3.0|It's a VERY fun game and I enjoy it.  However, it's a little annoying because you only get 5 lives at a time which go quickly (unless of course you want to BUY more!).  You can earn more if you're good and earn 2-3 stars on the levels, but if you're like me and not that good yet, then you have to wait an hour to 1!  I know I'm a cheapskate and shouldn't expect so much from a Free App, but having to pay to play for more than 10 minutes or so just means that I will play less or wait to play more later.
B007V9N5R8|5.0|My photography output has been greatly improved thank you. Calibration is the biggest key that made the improvements. I will buy more.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Bought this album ahead of the Raleigh show so I could listen to it on the way to The PNC Arena. It was good. Then saw Rush play on May 3rd. Absolutely as great as they've ever been!!! Listened to the disc about 3 times on the way home the next day during a 3 hour ride home. It gets better each time! Well worth picking this one up and if you get the chance go see the boys live don't think about it just GO!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Well, I mean, what can I say about HPotts that hasn't already been said? I'm actually a late bloomer when it comes to Harry Potter. I only read one book and saw one of the movies back when they came out.<br /><br />Seeing as how in 1997, I was the prime age (7th grade) to enjoy such a book I have no idea why I waited so long!<br /><br />But, I'm glad, at the wonderful age of 26, that I finally got into it and it is quite honestly my favorite book series of all time. What a fantastic story and SERIOUSLY MAGICAL MOVIES.<br /><br />As far as this collection goes - this is for you if you want the movies but don't care for any of the extras. Not sure the pricing on it now but I've seen it dip pretty low around Black Friday!
193700788X|1.0|It's as if we haven't been with these characters for 13 books.  Most of their actions are unbelievable and out of character.  It's as if the author was simply writing to meet a quota and end the book.  I'm half way through and I so far I've been able to predict what has happened and I'm almost sure I know the ending.  I'd pre-ordered the little companion book that comes after this that tells how the characters all fared but I cancelled that order; not wasting anymore of my good money or time reading these.  The last 3 or 4 books have actually been garbage and this was no different.  Very disappointing from the earlier books.  Oh well, at least I have the great beginning which led to the tv series, which I am also hoping they put out of its misery soon.  Overall, I stuck with this book series which was so promising and entertaining in the beginning, glad it's over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a wanderfull fun. Addicting and very challenging game. It is very nice that you keep getting new missions<br />and different scenarios and challenges. Plus you get to practice your game skills
1451627289|2.0|With Stephen King's impeccable reputation for telling great stories, I had extremely high expectations for '11/22/63'. I had never read one of his novels before but I chose this one because the theme involved politics which I love and one of the most spoken about events in American history: JFK's assassination. The premise of this novel is the protagonist's struggle as he goes back in time to change the course of history, lets put it. In my opinion, the novel had an extremely large digression that took the focus away from the main story line and basically became a romantic love novel for almost a quarter of the novel to the point where you find yourself asking, \\"When is the exciting part coming?\\" Furthermore, the author spends a vast amount of time explaining the entire time travel concept which is so ridiculous! At least in 'Terminator' if you changed the past it stayed changed. This opens up another entire can of worms trying to bridge the time travel concept. I don't want to give away any spoilers so all I will say is this, if you're going to read a Stephen King novel, choose another one that has more critical acclaim because this was an extreme disappointment, and I am an extremely avid reader and this failed to meet even the lowest standards for my expectations of what a political thriller is suppose to be.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I liked the book and I would tell other people to read the book. It is very very interesting.<br />Thank you.
B001IF252M|5.0|Typical product of apple, its perfect. I first purchased a cheaper adapter that stopped working after a few short months. This one works perfect, and Ive had it for over a year now. Im running an iMac with 2 additional monitors and nothing else works this good.
B0052GACNM|5.0|His voice continues to be very strong, and the partners he chose on this collection are superb!  get it while you can!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|It was a pretty good book, I was forced to read it for school but still enjoyed it! I got a bit tangled in the names at first but caught on soon. Great Book!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|An excellent movie that I will watch over and over again. The photography is superior and the ending is a surprise.
