B0015519VS|5.0|All These Young Dudes Need To Take Note!  Usher Is Back His New Album \\"Here I Stand\\" Is Usher At His Most Mature Great Follow Up From Confessions!!!
B0014YVCDK|3.0|A little personal back history, I bought this album trying to establish some semblance of cred in 2000. It was a tough time, eighth grade. My body was changing: I went from athletic to chubby back to athletic and had my wisdom teeth pulled. I grew out of Weird Al and the swing revival and moved on to what I thought was harder stuff like Sugar Ray and Incubus. I even raided my brother's CD collection. In it, I found Pearl Jam's Ten. It was pretty well beaten and wouldn't play, so I went to an Ames (remember those? They're all gone now!) and bought myself one at a \\"Nice Price!\\" (remember those stickers? They're all gone now!) for $8.00 or so.    Pearl Jam was always my favorite band to come out of the Pacific Northwest movement in the early 90s. Then again, I could only name Pearl Jam and Nirvana at that point that came out of that region. Oops. Anyways, a short time after I purchased Ten, I found out at Boarders (remember when it was cool to hang out there?) that they had a new CD so I picked it up. I was oddly confused then by what I heard. It was hard. There was screaming. No \\"Jeremy\\", \\"Alive\\", or \\"Evenflow\\", instead confusing key-changes and some non-radio friendly tracks. In short, at the time, I hated it and would have given probably only one or two tracks above 3 stars. How does it fare eight years later?    1. Breakerfall - Initially, the only track on the CD that I ripped to my computer in the days before Musicmatch or iTunes made it so convenient. \\"She lost her invitation to the party on earth. And she's standing outside, hating everyone here,\\" is a pretty cool metaphor that I use in every day speech. As you can probably tell from my other reviews, I love opening numbers, they're great at dictating the pace of album and can make it sink or swim. This one drives with a synging guitar riff and driving drums. There's a sense of immediacy and urgency in Eddie Vedder's voice. I'm a fan. Five out of five stars.    2. God's Dice - Cool musicianship in this one, butI have no idea what Vedder is saying in this one, which is automatic minus one star. This just isn't something I would listen to by choice, but it isn't unbearably bad to make me turn it off if it came on shuffle. Three out of five stars.    3. Evacuation - A really cool bridge almost raises this above \\"God's Dice\\" in terms of likability, but again, this song is just too hectic with muffled vocals. A little too hard for me. Three out of five stars.    4. Light Years - One of songs tucked away on this album that took a few listens to find. A nice soft number with a pinch of darkness in its chord progressions. I have a feeling this is what Jimmy Eat World was trying to do on their first album. Unfortunately, they failed miserably, and I wasted $12, but this song, \\"Light Years\\" is \\"Light Years\\" ahead of what they were doing at the time. Five out of five stars.    5. Nothing as It Seems - I would later buy this as a single just for kicks at Tower Record's going out of business sale for a mere $.04. It wasn't worth that much. Just a bad song. Lots of noise, lots of Pink Floyd influence, lots of garbage. I can't believe they would release this as a single, especially with the really good songs on this CD being exceptional. Only the bridges keep me from giving this song a one. Two out of five stars.    6. Thin Air - This is a cool track. Has a Neil Young vibe for the verses with a more modern chorus, with a hint of hauntingness. Will definitely listen to again. Four out of five stars.    7. Insignificance - This track was the B-Side for \\"Nothing as It Seems\\" and is significantly better. Definitely fits more the Pearl Jam style. Very cool chorus. Definitely glad I gave this song a second chance. Four out of five stars.    8. Of The Girl - One of the songs I used to skip over completely when listening to this album just because of the minute long intro. These days, the intro is still kind of boring and also serves as the outro, but the meat and potatoes the song is pretty good. Four out of five stars.    9. Grievance - One of the more embarrassing moments of eighth grade was telling my 10th grade friend Matt how cool I thought this album was and then when he started rattling off names of songs, I would agree. He named a name that actually wasn't on the album and I stated it was a really cool song, but he called me out on it. He also called me out on this song when he played it in his car when I couldn't identify it. It has since become a bittersweet song for me to listen to, but a good one nonetheless. After quite a few listens, I can safely say it's my favorite song on the album. Five out of five stars.    10. Rival - This song is a song I mistakenly identified as a Black Crowes song once in 2000. Ooops. It is pretty cool, moves a long at a relaxing pace, has my favorite guitar solo on the album, and is much cooler than anything the Black Crowes did in the year 2000. Four out of five stars.    11. Sleight of Hand - This song really bores me. To the point where I turn it off. And I don't like all of the noise in the middle. My least favorite track on the album. One out of five stars.    12. Soon Forget - A mandolin brings us in. Very cool chords used in this very quick, well told story. Five out of five stars.    13. Parting Ways - Sleight of Hand is exceptionally boring, and this comes in a close second on the album. However, this one can atleast maintain my interest and is pleasing to listen to. Not really a \\"surprise track\\" but if you keep the song long enough you hear something that resembles gun shots. I'll give it two out of five stars.    Review:      1. Breakerfall - Five Stars  2. God's Dice - Three Stars  3. Evacuation - Three Stars  4. Light Years - Five Stars  5. Nothing As It Seems - Two Stars  6. Thin Air - Four Stars  7. Insignificance - Four Stars  8. Of the Girl - Four Stars  9. Grievance - Five Stars  10. Rival - Four Stars  11. Sleight of Hand - One Stars  12. Soon Forget - Five Stars  13. Parting Ways - Two StarsAverage star rating = 3.62, slightly above average. A word of warning though, this album is strangely forgettable. Many of the songs, including \\"Light Years\\" and \\"Grievance\\" are very pleasing to the ear, but are completely forgettable, where as \\"Breakerfall\\" is a true standout. And I didn't just say that to cover my rear from that incident years ago. Or did I?
B0014DFCMS|4.0|This is a good movie you gotta see it, and in Blu-ray it's even better.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE MOVIE, ARRIVED JUST AS DESCRIBED AND WAS ALSO PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND DELIEVERY TIME. HOPE TO DO BUISNESS WITH AGAIN. SINCERELY, JODI
B0001CCXZW|5.0|What can I say? This show is the most amzing show I have ever seen. Every time I see it I am drawn in and amazed. You will connect with the characters; you will cry and laugh with them, and you will begin to care about them. The first season is incredible! I would more than highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!!
B00138SJ88|3.0|This review is for the Kindle format not for the story itself.<br /><br />From a non-Kindle story perspective this is a good read, but for reviews of the narrative itself refer to the paper edition.<br /><br />From a Kindle perspective -<br />DO NOT buy this particular version.  There are about three hundred different versions out there.  Even though this is about half the price of the next cheapest it is NOT worth it.<br /><br />There is no table of contents, all of the illustrations are missing, the spacing and formatting of text makes it obvious that this is a hackneyed attempt to upload a print version.  I'm sure that there are real Kindle versions out there so do yourself a favor and find one of those.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I love Gilmore Girls. It is an amazing show with incredible characters and a good plot. You will fall in love with these characters the moment you see them. The Second season is almost as good as the first, and totally worth seeing. I highly recommend it!!

B00004WG2F|5.0|Purchased \\"Legends of the Fall\\" and was very satisfied with the timely shipment, condition of the DVD, and  ease of making a purchase via internet. I'm not computer savvy, but Amazon makes it easy for people like me to find and purchase a product.
0385338724|3.0|While the story line is a lot like \\"13 Going On 30\\" with amnesia it is a very workable idea and Sophie Kinsella does a nice job with it.  I do think the characters could have been a little better developed which would have made the book more interesting.    A couple of reviewers did not like the more \\"explicit\\" mentions of sex and the fact that the character had an affair but I think it fits in just fine.  The \\"sex scenes\\" were actually quite funny.  Remember Me? is a great, fast read and a perfect summer beach book.  I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's books and will read anything else she writes.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I like the dance tracks on here. They remind me of why I started liking Madonna in the first place. Some songs sound similar to her earlier stuff though.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I love how many levels of stupidity are at play on this dummy projectile. It's bad enough that this uninspired, self-congratulatory cacaphony is closing in on 15 million units sold worldwide and has fooled scores of itchy, calloused critics into dishing out kneejerk-positive responses -- but on this crock opera, these sots rail against the very things they represent as a band in this marketplace: corporate scum, imitation, ennui. And excuse me ... the \\"media\\" Armstrong blasts on the title cut includes his watered-down trash of a concept album. The lyrics are bland; the whole thing has the stink of bandwagonry. They came across as lazy, ivy league dropouts on \\"Dookie,\\" and now they're grown-up \\"American Idiots.\\" Congratulations, boys.

B001437DMA|1.0|i never understood what was so great about Joe Satriani. Its obvious that he sucks. Listen to him play! Hes awful! I can't even sing along to this in my car because there are no vocals. What's the point of listening to it if its not catchy and I can't sing to it?    He should take some tips on how to play from Nickelback because they are much better.
0440237688|4.0|I bought this book for a child because it was recommended by another child. I read it before sending it and found the vocabulary to be at about an 8th grade level. This is a good book for a child who's of above-average reading ability in grammar school, especially because the topic lends itself to more than one level of meaning; consequently, the child could re-read it in a couple of years and find a different level of connection with the story. I think that children would identify with the plot, i.e. the hero child, and the values the book teaches are of the \\"Dr.Seuss\\" variety. I plan on sending it to other children when they're old enough.
0553714546|2.0|Cheated of the whole story, this is a version you do not want to own or listen to. After listening to the first two books in the unabridged version - narrated by a different person, this rapidly read, less than excellent version will leave you wishing you hadn't ruined the book in this way. Diana Gabaldon is an excellent author, that can tell a historical tale that has you gasping and looking for the next installment. This ABRIDGED version leaves too much of the story out and is read at a frantic pace, with little emotion. Don't waste your time or your money on this one.
B0015519VS|5.0|This album is sensational. I got to preview this album a week before it was released and loved it so much that I could not wait to buy or download this album. Usher plays a bad boy and a grown man on this album. In fact he sings about grown up stuff and things happening in his life that every real man can relate to.     It seems like a lot of stuff happened in his life between his last album Confessions and this album Here I stand that he put his heart and soul into. Every song is good and you won't get bored or tired halfway through while listening to this album, which is a sign of a quality album that is quite rare these days. I cannot stop listening to this album and some of the songs are really catchy. You'll be singing while your washing the dishes or something.
B000059RL3|5.0|Marvin Gaye's classic is still relevant today.  His peon to brotherhood, peace, ecology, faith, and hope, is even more relevant in an age where music appeals to hedonism and our prejudices.  This is music that raises the soul, opens your heart, and reconnects you to important human values.  This should be required listening on the short list of of American culture - Wizard of Oz, Citzen Kane, Huck Finn, etc....  Recorded over 30 years ago, it continues to echo across time for its music and message.  Take a break from a lot of forgetable music that masquerades as entertainment and come in for some real content here.
B00000IQW5|5.0|We purchased this movie a watched it about a month ago. It is a really good movie. I give it an A+.
B00009W8N2|5.0|This album is perfect.  It's all there: killer guitar riffs, awesome lyrics, great death vocals, beautiful clean vocals, untouchable acoustic work, and even a beautiful piano solo piece.    My favorites are 'In Mist She Was Standing', 'The Twilight is my Robe', and 'Forest of October'.    The only Opeth album that I've truly been able to call anything less than spectacular is 'Ghost Reveries,' even though it's a very enjoyable album.  This is the best band on the planet.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|For the delivery it comes early than I expected so thx for that issue, for the product it is working fine no problem but there are no extra bonus items at the cd so only that is a problem for me,    Best Regards,
B000002WUD|5.0|I recommend this collection highly.  I just love hearing the interaction between people in the studio and some of the false starts.  After viewing pictures of Elvis and his group in a studio setting, I can close my eyes, listen to these recordings and I am \\"there in the studio\\".  Great!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|The music on this cd has made me a #1 fan of Michael Buble. His satin-smooth voice and great choice of songs make this cd a must-have for any music lover!
B00005JPNZ|5.0|Unbelievable.       How can anyone say that this film was trash. This was Indiana Jones  pure and simple. The movie was fantastic because it was entertaining. I can understand people having certain issues as far as it being too far fetched but even that is an unvalid excuse. All of the Indiana Jones films have been extremely over the top. I have been reading so many negative reviews and it just doesn't make any sense. What does everyone expect it to be. Lets see you try to make a film of this caliber. Maybe it would turn out little bit better but it would never be perfect because no movie in history is or ever will be perfect. In my honest opinion I think that a lot of people are panning this movie due to all of the negative problems going on in our world right now ( example: gas prices, the war and our economy ). I just think that there is an extreme amount of pecimissim in our society at this point and they need something to bash on. People are going into the theater to watch this movie all ready full of negativity. I really liked and enjoyed this movie and I am having a really hard time believing that there is a moderate amount of people out there saying that this latest installment is garbage. Please dont get me wrong I am not implying that everyone isn't intitled to their own opinion. I think once again a lot of people went into this wonderful film with an unrealistic anticipation. Of course this installment was going to be different. It is no longer the 1980's. Filming has changed and evolved in many ways since then so it's going to look and feel a little different. My 18 year old stepson watched the movie with me. He has seen all of the Indiana Jones movies and he told me that KOTCS was by far his favorite out of all of them. Just had to get that off my chest.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|This is good stuff. His cover of love comes to everyone led me to buy the George Harrison's original only to find out that Eric plays the opening riffs.
B000SNUMC0|4.0|Bon, j'ai pas envie de faire un commentaire en anglais.  Pour faire simple, c'est du bon Iced Earth sans pour autant être le meilleur.  Vivement que Matt revienne au chant!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I saw the movie and had to get the CD.  I was happy it had the songs that were stuck in my head.  I wanted the live version or club version of a couple of songs but, it's just the studio version.  Great driving music for long trips and cool music for traffic.  Gotta find happiness where you can in a commute.
0312360266|5.0|This was a quick and easy read. I think it may not really be for middle/high school students, unless they are mature enough for the themes. I read it in about a day, but it was worth it.  I was amused by the things that were entwined with the story, like the pop culture aspect. I think it is okay that the book will be dated in a few years since the core concept of the book will remain intact.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this book and think it is worth a quick mindless read that will make you want to talk about it with others.
1416550518|5.0|\\"Last November I had a nightmare. It was 1924 and I was at Riverton again.\\" Thus begins \\"The House at Riverton\\" by Kate Morton. It's no accident that it opens with an homage to \\"Rebecca.\\" Morton admits in an end note that she wanted to recreate the feeling of a work by Daphne du Maurier, Kazuo Ishiguro or Evelyn Waugh. And she does.    Grace, our narrator, is 98 in 1999 and looks back over her life. She recounts becoming a servant in 1914 in the great British house at Riverton, where the butler irons the morning newspaper and keeps the family's secrets. As a servant, Grace is privy to all the family's activities, because they ignore the staff, and she witnesses the suicide of a famous poet one night at the mansion. In 1999 a producer is making a movie about that event, but Grace keeps insisting -- to us alone -- that what everyone \\"knows\\" happened that night is wrong. This book has many levels, and Morton's characters are anything but stick figures; they breathe and ache and find joy, and they are affected deeply by the Great War, the evolving society, and the changing roles of women and men.    I fell in love with this book early on -- the characters, the secrets, the details, the romance, the writing. Ahhh, the writing! Here's what happens after a sunset: \\"The shimmering crescent has disappeared, leaving the sky bereft: a clear, cold blue, lacerated by streaks of frosty white. The heath itself shivers in the sudden shadow, and in the distance a train sneaks through the valley fog, electric brakes moaning as it turns towards the village.\\" Later, one very small, simple image just stopped me cold: Outside the nightclub, \\"she turned to thank him, and watched as the club's reflected name slid off his black cab as he disappeared into the night.\\" Just lovely.    It's a deliciously long, old-fashioned novel --one of those you wrap yourself in and come away feeling as if you'd known the characters. It is a pretty extraordinary debut novel by this Australian writer. I thinkfans of \\"Upstairs, Downstairs,\\" \\"Rebecca\\" and \\"Remains of the Day\\" will love it. Also, the talk of WWI aircraft and Bleriots reminds me of \\"Flambards.\\" Someone is bound to turn it into a movie. Do yourself a huge favor and read it first.
B00133KHCY|5.0|Most of the reviews I have read recap the story line, which I believe we all knew from numerous movie trailers.  Therefore,  all I want to say is that I wasn't looking for reality but for enjoyment when I watched it.  That is exactly what I got.  The music and the storyline were very enjoyable and if you like fairy tales, you will enjoy this movie.  I felt very good after watching this movie and there aren't many movies that do that for me.  I usually watch suspense and intrigue types of movies and an occasional comedy as there aren't that many other types of movies that will hold my attention.  This movie kept my attention from beginning to end.  So, what if it is fluff as long as you enjoy it.  I did!!
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Saw her live and enjoyed her and the band very much.  I was hoping this CD and DVD would recreate that experience  and it mostly does.  If you like her music I think   this is definitely worth the money.
0785125965|3.0|World War Hulk. All I can say is that the story is good but seems a little bit rush compare to what they have been doing since Planet Hulk. Also, the artwork of JRJR is just so-so in this collection. No offense to him, but his art in Daredevil, Spider-Man is much more better. I wonder why Marvel don't let the artwork team in Planet Hulk draw this books. Or maybe Marvel should let David Finch draw this entire books instead of just covers.
B0018CAAN6|2.0|Old Madonna fans will find this album below their expectations.If you like mindless workout music it's a winner, but if you are looking for that old Madonna spark, better preview each song before buying.
B000P12LWY|1.0|Note to Showtime: Bad idea to to put your own spin on one of the most well documented periods of English History.  I certainly understand that in depicting history, it is necessary to telescope events or even weed out minor figures.  However, by \\"combining\\" Henry's sisters, the brainiacs at Showtime have wiped out both Lady Jane Grey and Mary Queen of Scots! Margaret, the older sister, married the King of Scotland and was grandmother to Mary.  Mary, the younger sister, initially married the King of France (and was rumored to have killed him via exertions in the marriage bed, not a pillow) and then went on to marry Brandon.  Her daughter, Frances, gave birth to Lady Jane Grey.  I gather from reading the boards that Margaret goes on to die of consumption.  I can only assume that the British actors taking part in these 8 episode romp thru the beds of rich-n-famous courtiers figured Americans were too ignorant to know their history anyway.  For a much better representation of Tudor England, buy the Keith Mitchell series \\"Henry the VII and his Six Wives\\".
B00132D808|5.0|It's amazing.    Good condition.  Amazing band.    Amazing CD.
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|This movie had its moments but on the whole was not a favorite. My 7 and 8 year olds just didn't go for it.

0452289963|5.0|This book is wonderful, and because I was so anxious to start reading it, I appreciated Amazon getting it to me so fast!!
B00005MP58|5.0|I absolutely love Pride & Prejudice. I could sit and watch this movie over and over again. Jane Austin told an amazing story of how one person's pride and another's prejudice actions create a conflict between two opposite lifestyles. They both find that deep down, they have an irresistible attraction to each other. They both learn to work on these faults and soon are new people!     This is a clean and wholesome film for the whole family!
B0000C9ZSV|5.0|Since the days of this memorable recital that stirred up so many positive comments, many of us had firmly believed, we never would have the chance to listen it.<br /><br />This recital found Hendrix in top form, in absolute domain of the musical form, surrounded of an outburst of volcanic energy, intense musicality and visceral expression.<br /><br />\\"Machine gun\\" for instance, is a real tour de force piece, filled of forceful violence and unmatched virtuousness. \\"Purple haze\\" and \\"Star spangled banner\\" breathe not only the well outburst of energy but supported by a major level of profundity, which clearly may be noticed through the expansiveness of the sound, the creative twists where the lyricism is well torn apart to convey us to unvisited territories.<br /><br />The restoration process is another highlight. A full rounded sound without distortions, bubbles or distortions.<br /><br />If you are a hard fan of this supreme exponent of the guitar, you really should not miss this anthological album, that must be regarded as one of the top five resurrected rock albums ever.<br /><br />Another emblematic achievement of the prince of guitar, whose sound has not been able to be unsurpassed until now although all the technological advances since then.<br /><br />A collector item.
B000O599ZS|5.0|Probably the Duke's greatest film.  A large scale epic of a quest by Ford with Wayne tracking his lost niece -- after Indians raid her home and kill her family.  Aided by Jeffrey Hunter, this a truly monumental motion picture and not simply one of the greatest westerns ever made.  Wayne's character is a man who truly loses everything -- best exemplified by the final scene.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|The movie had plenty of excitement. I feel it is almost even with all the other Indiana movies in excitement and action, but something was missing. The puzzle of the skulls that made up the movie was a bit too simple. No one had to do much to figure anything out. More complication of the crystal skulls would have been nice. That is all I can say without giving anything away. The boy who co-starred in the movie,Shia LaBeouf didn't get in the way, as I was afraid he would, well not too much anyway. To me he was a bit annoying and the story could have carried on without him. I wish for more Indy action, they could of hired more body doubles or something. Marion was great! I always liked her. She was still the same, maybe a bit more mellow. All my nit-picking being said-Even with the other movies. Indy fans shouldn't be disappointed.
B000067DNC|3.0|Not my favorite season of SG1.  The plot takes some ridiculous digressions.<br />That said, it is the season we meet the Tok'Ra, Linnea, and Jacob Carter.<br /><br />My favorite episode of this season is The Fifth Race, where O'Neil accidentally has all the knowledge of the ancients downloaded into his brain.  This has the brilliant combination of comedy and seriousness that we have come to love in this series.<br /><br />If you love SG1 you will continue to love it through this season, but don't look for the greatness of other seasons here.
B000TERK3C|5.0|There...I've said it.  The Radiohead-heads are going to come after me for this but this is far better than \\"OK Computer\\".  I've never quite been able to get into that one aside from a few songs.  Maybe it's because it's not very accessible that the diehard fans foam at the mouth over \\"OK Computer\\".  Enough about that CD though.  \\"The Bends\\" is fantastic.  \\"High and Dry\\" is the hit but the title track, \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", \\"Planet Telex\\" and \\"Just\\" are all simply fantastic.  Thom Yorke's vocals are so much stronger on here than on...oops! I forgot I was through talking about that other CD.  Anyway if you are new to Radiohead start here and if you like then give that other CD a try.
B000Y179KO|5.0|It may lack that take-no-prisoners edge of former days, but what a beautiful, heart-felt record this is. You can hear the wizened experience poured into each lyric, you can feel the I've-been-here-before sentiment of each song as the singer is forced to sing it sadly once more. It's so rare to hear any group recapture their brilliance with such successful results, but I'm starting to see why they reunited and toured for so long before putting this out; it would seem they've recaptured their groove. Bravo, gentlemen.
B000000OF6|5.0|If you are a Queen fan, you must have this greatest hits collection.  Not only is the music fantastic, the price was great.
B00004TDTO|5.0|The \\"Original Summer Blockbuster\\" should be part of everyone's movie inventory.  How many times have I seen it?  I have no idea, but I'll watch it again and again!    The DVD arrived in a very timely manner and was in excellent condition, as advertised.    I would not hesitate in the least to do business with this excellent Amazon vendor.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|If you cried when the series ended its TV run, you'll love this boxed set.    In addition to the shows themselves, it has many \\"extras\\", such as behind the scenes interviews.

I was searching for some nice idea to add a sparkle in my quilts and here I am! The projects in this book are great in themselves, but are beautiful even if you use just one of them (or some scattered random) as a single block to give movement and brightness in a \\"classic\\" quilt!  Beautiful!

Just 4 fundamental recipes (plain, chocolate, gingerbread and a nutty-yummy one) and LOADS of interesting tips about speeding the process of roll-bake-decorate-send. And what a wonderful edition too: with a old-fashion look I found so appealing!  Good writing and funny, too! And cristal clear instructions...   I love this book!
0452289963|5.0|There is great value in reading any Oprah-recommended nonfiction selection to see what currently impresses a broad spectrum of readers. As is the case with many highly popular books, after reading Tolle's book itself I read dozens of reviews here spanning one-to-five stars. I think there's merit across the range of these one-to-five-star reviews, as I'll explain.       On a substantive level Tolle offers very little that is new, especially within the realm of Buddhism, a fact highlighted by the one-star reviews. But he states his points calmly and well, with an almost hypnotically rhythmic cadence, which many readers find fascinating and helpful, translating into some five-star reviews. I have rated this five stars mainly because Eckhart presents this kind of subject matter in a gently and effectively educative way to those unfamiliar with it in other contexts.       Tolle extols an egoless state, which he describes, ironically, in an ego-embroidered tone. He recommends that we \\"resist nothing,\\" which means of course that we passively accept everything -- which is easier to achieve, of course, if one is an elfish man with a prepuberty-sized, whisker-hidden chin, than if one is more endocrinologically adequate with a Harrison Ford jaw. This amply documented correlation (published psychological studies) between physiology, emotional states and philosophical ideas is not addressed in Eckhart's book. Timid individuals find far more comfort in egoless withdrawal than do psychologically sturdy people, especially those with managerial responsibilities. Tolle's indisputably valuable teachings, that is, find far better fit among those who have encountered chronic stress in societal competition than among those who easily relax in the fray of life because they can handle it without overstressing their emotions and developing rationales of detachment. To Tolle's credit, though, everyone can use some meditative detachment sometimes, quieting the head-buzz and calming thepain-body before picking up the tools again to be the proactive mom engaging with the world to tend her family, or to be the go-getter dad who values his proactive sweetheart and prefers that they cooperate in active involvement with their world rather than retreating from it in egoless surrender, resisting nothing as their eyes reflect the elfish timidity of declared egolessness subconsciously supported by covert ego-driven renunciation seeing itself as enlightenment.
1594489505|3.0|While I agree that this is a story worth telling, I was hoping I would have been more captivated and felt more engaged. Instead I felt more like a distant observer than being right in the middle of the events/action. As a result it failed to move me much emotionally or leave a lasting impression. I often felt as if the descriptions were too generic; and not enough was done to convey the atrocities with enough passion/emotion to really make me care.     The story is interesting enough and moves at a good, even pace; but there is 'just' enough interest to keep turning the pages, no more.
B000PHX4VA|4.0|My title sums it up. This collection is a nice balance of Top 40, rock radio hits, and album tracks from the Police. My only gripe is the uneven quality of the recordings. Given the available remastering  technology I expected a fuller, richer sound. It's okay, ... but that's also it's shortcoming...it's JUST okay.
B000AP04L0|5.0|Really really good movie. I could watch some of the scenes over and over. Cast works well together and movie catches what every worker tries to feel like in just chillin out, enjoying life and not carring.
0385338724|5.0|I love Kinsella's \\"Shopaholic\\" books, but her stand-alone novels have been less than stellar.  \\"Remember Me?,\\" however, is a wonderful exception.  Kinsella takes what could easily have been a hackneyed plot line and works it into a story that fresh and rings true (even for those of us who have thankfully never had amnesia).  It's fluff, sure, but it's not all sunshine; Lexi, the protagonist and narrator, faces a host of difficult issues with family, friends, and career.  Kinsella's gift is in making you root for the heroine, regardless of her faults.  My only criticism of \\"Remember Me?\\" is the treacly and much-too-neat final chapter.  Otherwise, I loved this one and tore through it.
B0011Z33ES|5.0|Just like all of Josh Groban's CDs, he sings beautifully on this one too.  I Highly recommend any of his music.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Ok, so now the three part saga has become a six part extravaganza with the '99 release of `Star Wars - The Phantom Menace'. And just when I was about to forgive George Lucas for inventing those ridiculous Ewoks in `Return of the Jedi' he goes even further into the realm of the absurd with the creation of Jar-Jar Binks (You're not a Jedi George, you've already shown us you can't trust your instincts so think before you create).<br /><br />The special effects definitely continue to improve with each new adventure and getting the Jedi more involved is a big plus. The sinister looking Sith Darth Maul is also a wonderful addition to the 'Star Wars' mythos. Though initially pleased to see the Order of the Jedi play a much larger role in the storyline, unfortunately the \\"words of wisdom\\" dispensed by the members of this Order of mystical warriors now comes across as shallow and pretentious, not profound as it had in the earlier films. Yes even with the return of a younger Yoda (since the new films chronologically pre-date the original trilogy) the lessons of the Jedi have lost their potency.<br /><br />When all is said and done the big question that still puzzles me is why does Lucas continue to populate the screen with so many cartoon looking characters that ruin the Star Wars experience for any fan above the age of twelve? Evidently he's seeking an ever younger audience.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|This CD is excellent.  I saw Brad Paisley in concert a few months ago, and decided to purchase this CD.  Make sure to listen the last few tracks (which aren't listed on the playlist); funny, funny.  The songs are an excellent fix, some funny, some sad, all worth hearing.  Paisley is among the best of his generation of country stars; the accolades that he receives are well deserved.
0670018651|4.0|Perfume is the \\"unknown art\\", very expensive, and very mysterious.  People want to buy it, and to use it, but are not really interested  in what goes on back stage. This is an excellent introduction to that  world, but of greatest value in giving a kind of \\"buyer's guide\\" to  the range of both men's and women's fragrances.
6305907145|1.0|This movie did absolutely no credit to Jane Austen's work.  It was completely different from the book.  All the innocence and morality of Austen's \\"Mansfield Park\\" was supplanted by immorality.  The director did a horrible job.
B0015YDK1Q|5.0|in my opinion....one of the best latin pop rock bands ever, and they show it once more in this live CD/DVD of their last world tour. you won't be dissapointed with this purchase....great sound and images.
B000P12LWY|3.0|While I enjoyed the style of this miniseries and likely will watch future seasons of it, as a Anglo-history buff, some of the glamorizations done to the facts (or complete misconstruing of the facts to make for better drama) bothered me.<br /><br />Others have mentioned all the historical inaccuracies, and they do abound.  Still hopefully this series will entice folks to look deeper into the actual history.<br /><br />My recommendation to anyone seeking really good drama on Henry VIII that combines with good history is watch \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" with Keith Michell.  This drama is nowhere near that calibre, though it has the advantage of gorgeous filming.
0345446798|5.0|Don't go into this book expecting a manual and you will not be disappointed.  It's a conversationally delivered comparisson of primates and canid behaviors, and how they sometimes (often) conflict, with some stories that make it all seem more relevant to real life, mixed in.  I enjoyed this book because I find this topic fascinating.  The next time I trained a dog after reading this book, I was more aware of what I was doing, and the training went much more easily.  When studying Ethology, I've found that people don't like to think of themselves as animals, and not necessarily controlling absolutely every signal other animals perceive, so it may offend some people to compare primates to humans, but I think the comparissons are helpful and find them extremely relevant.<br /><br />If you are looking for a manual on training, I suggest Beginning Family Dog Training, also written by Patricial McConnell.  It IS a manual, and the majority of the dissatisfied reviews about this book I've seen would probably have been eliminated if they'd read that book too.  Having trained animals for a while now, I would suggest reading both of them, but not having expectations of a manual from The Other End of the Leash.<br /><br />If you're interested in communicating with animals, dogs in particular, this can be a very interesting read.  Using bodily signals you aren't really aware of, you're communicating all of the time.  This book helps to point them out, make you aware of them, and gives advice on increasing the helpful ones and eliminating the not-so-helpful ones.  You end up training yourself, and really helping your dog understand what you want communicate, and not just what they've seen you communicating.
B00009RDG9|5.0|The Hunted is one of William Friedkin most underated pictures.The Director who defined Film as an art with classics like French Connection or The Exorcist brings us the story of a burnt out soldier who starts a killing mission.His instructor is the one who is chosen to hunt him down.The film is a well structured action cracker full of violent knife- duels and very tight action pieces.It doesn't use wire-tricks or CGI.The DVD itself has a very informative commentary by Friedkin and short making of featurettes.Highly Recommended.
B000SW16CQ|5.0|Amazing movie with the right balance of comedy and drama. All of the actors, including the children, are amazing.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|The Reverend Al Green's latest is an 11 track CD co-produced by Ahmir ?uestlove Thompson of The Roots. Still in excellent vocal form, it is an album steeped in seventies soul; that lovely falsetto, stabbing horns, and lilting percussion, and sounding untouched by time. Despite ?uestlove's Hip hop roots (pardon the pun), the album sounds like it was recorded in the seventies.<br /><br />He gets help from some of the current stable of Neo Soul vocalists on a few tracks; Anthony Hamilton on the tender opening Gospel-tinged title track \\"Lay it down\\", and \\"You've got the love I need\\", UK songstress Corinne Bailey Rae's jazzy vocals on the slow burning \\"Take your time\\", and John legend on the absolutely stunning \\"Stay with me (By the sea)\\" (lovely delicate vocals from the pair and great ethereal harmonies). The last pair are my favourites.<br /><br />The lilting \\"Just for me\\" reminds me a bit of his classic \\"Let's stay together\\", \\"No one like you\\" is a beautiful ballad with sprinklings of horns and organ, \\"What more do you want from me\\" is a bit more upbeat, the piano ballad \\"Too much\\", the laid back semi acoustic ballad \\"All I need\\", the sunny, upbeat \\"I'm wild about you\\", and closing also on an upbeat note is \\"Standing in the rain\\" (with gritty vocals).<br /><br />This album is great with excellent musicianship (great harmonies, guitars, horns and percussion), real soul music in an era where there are loads of pretenders to the throne.
B00104QSOM|5.0|This film is a total package art form.  It has fascinating story, all around great actors and mesmerizing music that from the start is letting us know that there could not be possible good ending to this storytelling.  We learn about Daniel Plainview, a man who is living in California searching for oil.  It is late 1800s and people are still trying to find their own riches in the new land.  Daniel is shrewd, calculated and persistent.  He wants to succeed in his endeavors more than anything.  We learn about the day of the oil man rigger who life is full of physical demands and hard work.  Job is dirty and dangerous and oil fields are not afraid to claim their victims.  As Daniel becomes successful and accumulates capital, he is eager to continue searching for new wells and dig them until there is no more oil left.  In that effort helps him his young son whose innocent looks and quiet demeanor are bait for family people eager to sell their property to another family man trying to make a living for himself and his motherless son.  This all continues well until Daniel meets his arch nemesis - a local preacher who wants to make a congregation from the local oil diggers and their families.  Over the years, these two have their own disagreements and manage to get even with each other only to prove to each other that they are really the same and as such cannot coexist.  What fascinated me is the character of Daniel - he is dark, full of hatered and contempt of people even the ones closest to him, he is a loner without ever feeling lonely who knows how to feed of other people's emotions and needs and then use them to his own advantage.  This is one of those films that everyone should have in their personal library.  Daniel Day Lewis has won Academy Award for his role of Daniel Plainview but I must say that young Paul Dano was a great supporting actor too.
B0015519VS|4.0|In the 4 years since Usher released his blockbuster \\"Confessions\\" album, some major changes have occured in his life; He has gotten married and become a father. The influences of these are heard in his new album, \\"Here I am\\", from the album cover art that shows his son's birthdate on the car license plate, to the cries of his son on the interlude \\"Prayer for you\\" (on which he promises to be there for his son).<br /><br />On the beautiful ballad \\"Before I met you\\", he confesses that he was a playa before I met you, and on \\"Appetite\\", he is painfully honest as he talks about the fight to keep his lust under control whenever he's away from his wife.<br /><br />The album is ballad heavy, with only 2 uptempo tracks, the really groovy \\"This aint sex\\" (which has an 80s vibe), and the will.i.am produced \\"What's your name\\" (with techno-sounding strings and Usher saying \\"Like Donna Summer, girl give me this last dance\\"). It seems Usher has been listening to Techno quite a bit as techno strings are also used in the smash hit \\"Love in this club\\", the awesome ballad \\"Moving mountains\\", and the acoustic \\"What's a man to do\\"<br /><br />Other standouts are the retro soul ballad \\"Something special\\", \\"Love you gently\\", the Stevie Wonder channelling title track \\"Here I stand\\", and the hidden track \\"Will work for love\\" (which tells the tale of some man down on his luck and begging for anything to do).<br /><br />Jay Z appears on \\"Best thing\\" while his new bride appears on \\"Love in this club Part 2\\" (a different song, if you ask me) which is currently climbing the Billboard Hot 100.<br /><br />My favourite track though is the stunning ballad \\"His mistakes\\", a piano ballad with awesome vocals from Usher. In fact, his vocals are so much stronger and soaring on this album.<br /><br />I usually don't like ballad heavy R&B albums, but a lot of thought obviously went into this album, and in my opinion, this is his best album yet.
B000XA5K48|5.0|What can you really say about a movie like this? It definitely lives up to its name. People get shot. Big time. Is it more or less plotless? Yes. Is it completely over-the-top? Yes. Is it kind of a symbol of everything that's wrong with our society? You bet. It's also ridiculously entertaining. People get killed with vegetables! Clive Owen delivers a baby and then severs the umbilical cord with a pistol shot! People jump out of planes and get chopped up by helicopter blades! Paul Giamatti gets shot - and then gets shot again - and then gets shot again - and doesn't die! Monica Bellucci gets naked! (My husband liked that part the best, obviously).     The amazing thing to me was that three talented people who have all done serious dramatic work really threw themselves into their roles and gave the movie everything they had - especially Clive Owen. His one-liners make the movie and his deadpan humor adds a lot of entertainment value. The other great thing about this movie is that it knows exactly how over-the-top it is. Jackie Chan has been getting laughs off totally implausible stunts for forever - why does he get a patent on that kind of entertainment? I honestly laughed harder at this movie, and enjoyed it more, than anything else I've seen in a long time. This movie is a great antidote to all the dumb movies out there that take themselves way, WAY too seriously. This is not the movie for anyone who even mildly squeamish - has even a mild problem with violence - or is uncomfortable with graphic sex. Also probably not recommended for lovers of all things highbrow. If those things don't bother you, and you love a good stupid-fun movie - then definitely, this is the movie to see.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|After several Pierce Brosnan ventures into Bond territory, I had felt the franchise to be worn out.  But this new entry being based on the very first book by Ian Fleming and starring Daniel Craig has revived the series substantially.  Craig is a great surprise as 007 and the Blu-ray edition is brilliant thoroughout even better than when I first saw it on the big screen!!  The villains are ruthless as ever and the gimmicks are kept to a minimum.  For once we are treated to a Bond flick which is more character driven than plot oriented. So if you have a big screen HDTV and a blu-ray player I suggest you purchase this gem whenever there's a sale.  Totally recommended for Bond enthusiasts and Blu-ray addicts!!
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Independence Day (ID4) is a Great Movie and very enjoyable on standard DVD. But when you watch it on Blue Ray it EXPLODES. The 5.1 Surround is so pure and extremely exciting. The PQ is pristine and details which may have been overlooked in Standard DVD come alive in Blue Ray. While not every movie needs to be viewed in Blue Ray, this is one that should be in the Top 10 of everyone's collection.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I highly recommend this film, if you are a Sci Fi fan... and even if you are not!     Cloverfield is an excellent American monster movie. A good 21st century update to the 1950's genre of Japanese monster movies.  Character development is well done.. and is no easy feat in a movie which is shot like this one.  The film is presented as a few hours of amateur video tape that was found by the government after a disaster in NYC. To the filmmakers credit, they stick completely this format, never breaking from it once, enhancing the first person experience for all of us. The monster itself is not of the traditional sort, and gives your imagination plenty to wonder about.    As the film has also made quite a splash on the internet, it is great to have our own copy of it, so we can zoom in or stop frame the film to look for things that pass quickly on the film or are very small!  What a blast.
0618918248|5.0|This book is, essentially, a wakeup call to thinking people who have allowed themselves to be lured into the trap set by religionist wherein religion is given special dispensation and thus allowed to continue its role as a breeding ground for terrorism and atrocities.<br /><br />The book's title is much less suggestive of this conclusion than another one of recent publication -- and which I also recommend -- \\"God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything\\" by Christopher Hitchens.  But, after meandering over a lot of preliminary territory, that's where it arrives by Chapter 8.  To that extent, the two books could be considered echoes of each other, but that would do injustice to the very different writing styles of the authors and the way they bring the evidence to the table.<br /><br />Of the two, Richard Dawkins' style is the more academic and intellectual, and so that targets it to a slightly different audience. Thinking people who are able to appreciate the British penchant for terseness and understatement will probably enjoy this book immensely.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|Great movie.  I love the graphics.  I went with a used video purchase and I could not have been happier with the service & purchase!

B00006I53S|1.0|I got this lens as a birthday present for myself and was very happy with it for a couple of weeks. As others have written, the 28-135mm range makes this a great walk-around lens. About three weeks after I bought it the camera worked intermittently no matter what the mode (Auto or TV for example). Sometimes the camera would fire, sometimes it wouldn't. Sometimes I would get an \\"Err 01\\" message (\\"Communication between camera and lens is faulty. Clean the lens contacts\\"). Needless to say, it wasn't dirty contacts on my brand new lens or camera body. I put the kit lens back on and it worked perfectly. When I put the EF 28-135 lens back on, I noticed that even when the lens clicks into position I could still move the lens on the body a tiny bit. Sometimes I could rotate the lens enough to align the contacts and take a picture, sometimes not. Pretty disheartening...    I bought the lens on Amazon who used Adorama to sell it to me. Adorama's policy is no refunds or exchanges after 14 days. I tried calling them to see if they might cut me some slack and got a busy signal all morning. I gave up and called Canon. After a 6 minute wait they were pleasant and told me how to ship it for repair.     By the way, the service representative advised me NOT to ship it in the original box because I probably wouldn't get it back.     I'll post an update to this review when I get my lens back.

B000002U9E|5.0|In 1985 I bought the record and wore it out, literally! Then I bought the cassette and played it till it broke about a year ago. Bought the CD and still listening to it to this day. No one else, other than the Beatles, would cause me to do this. Kate Bush was awesome then and still is today. Do yourself a favor and run, do not walk, to get this CD. While you're there pick up Kate's \\"The Kick Inside\\" and listen to two Kate's! Both awesome in different ways.
B000V86OKG|4.0|Having watched the 1st season, I wondered how they could better it, but I thought they did. The story arc they introduced was totally unexpected to me, but it worked brilliantly.  This was compulsive viewing, although I thought it was a little darker than the last season.  The new characters worked well, and Dexter, as ever was played superbly.  I would have given it 5 stars, but for....   ***SPOILER FOLLOWS***    As another reviewer has already said, the last 5 minutes should have been cut.  When Lila left the country that should have been the end of her.  Dexter is not an international assassin and so having him fly half way across the globe on a revenge killing is not his style.  They tried to wrap it up too neatly.  It didn't work.  The thought of her coming back could have added some uncertainty into the next series although they could easily have reported her death some other way if they wanted Dexter to be totally in the clear. Brilliant season, but with a goofed ending, I thought.
B0013V33DG|5.0|We have this opera with other casts and companies.  This one is the best we have ever seen.  Juan Diego Florez hits all his high Cs effortlessly and he is a beautiful young man.  We understand giving him a standing ovation in the biggest opera houses of the world.  But Ms. Dessay is fabulous!  Her voice is perfect, her bel canto presentation flawless and her comedic actions show us what Donizetti had in mind when he wrote the piece.  The pair are both slim, young and lovely to look at and one could believe them as teen aged lovers...this was the part that always bothered us with Sutherland and Pavarotti. We sent gift copies to a friend and a relative and hope for more from this pair.
B00005JLFC|4.0|I agree with others in wondering where the DVD is of this movie.  I saw this movie in the theater when it came out and loved it then.

I think it is long overdue.

0307265730|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri's third book contains five short stories plus three stories with linked characters. Like the stories in her first, Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Interpreter of Maladies, these stories are gems. Her second-generation immigrant Bengali young adults are coping with the loss of parents as well as the stress of living with the expectations of two cultures.  These seemingly simple tales linger with the reader. This work is so movingly true it seems astonishing coming from a young writer. Beautiful!

0316166685|1.0|The only people who would enjoy this book are the ones who think that reading a meaningless account of a young girl's rape/murder is fun.     For the rest of us the book is horrifying, disturbing, and nauseating. It's also quite frustrating because the author foreshadows some sort of punishment for the rapist/murderer, but in the end the justice is tepid and disappointing.    It would be one thing if the girl's suffering meant something within the book, but the author just uses that method of death for sensationalistic value. If she wanted to portray what dead people are thinking, why not have the girl die from something less horrific than rape/murder?    Basically, the author exploits the topics of rape and murder and does nothing novel or interesting with them. Her book is a slap in the face to rape and murder victims and the people who love/d them.

Think John was psst for a reason? The rest is all history now. Yoko didn't break up the Beatles ,Yoko and Linda did.

B0013SJ44Q|5.0|If you like Otis Redding, you should buy this newly remastered album.  If you already have it, the stereo mastering work they did on this makes it worth the purchase alone, but you will also find several live cuts, unreleased b-sides and other gems that make this worth a purchase.    It is hard to believe that Otis recorded this entire album in 24 hours, it is even harder to fathom that he was just 26 when he did so.  So much soul in such a young man.
1416562591|4.0|In his debut novel, Aravind Adiga takes on some hefty issues:  the unhappy division of social classes into haves and have-nots, the cultural imperialism of the First World, the powder-kegged anger that seethes among the world's dispossessed, and entrapment.  But his skills as an author protect the novel from becoming one of those horrible didactic stories in which characters and plot are little more than mouthpieces and vehicle for delivering Great Truths.  The White Tiger entertains and gives pause for thought.  This is a good combination.<br /><br />The plot centers around Balram Halwai, a laborer born and raised in a small village utterly controlled by crooked and feudally powerful landlords.  The village is located in 'the Darkness,' a particularly backward region of India.  Balram is eventually taken to Delhi as a driver for one of the landlord's westernized sons, Ashok.  It's in Delhi that Balram comes to the realization that there's a new caste system at work in both India and the world, and it has only two groups:  those who are eaten, and those who eat, prey and predators.  Balram decides he wants to be an eater, someone with a big belly, and the novel tracks the way in which this ambition plays out.<br /><br />A key metaphor in the novel is the rooster coop.  Balram recognizes that those who are eaten are trapped inside a small and closed cage--the rooster coop--that limits their opportunities.  Even worse, they begin to internalize the limitations and indignities of the coop, so that after awhile they're unable to imagine they deserve any other world than the cramped one in which they exist.  Balram's dream is to break free of his coop, to shed his feathers and become what for him is a symbol of individualism, power, and freedom:  a white tiger.  But as he discovers, white tigers have their own cages, too.<br /><br />Of course, it's not simply the Balram's of the world caught in the rooster coop.  Adiga's point seems to be that even the world's most privileged suffer from a cultural and class myopia that limits perspective and distorts self-understanding.  The White Tiger is a good tonic with which to clear one's vision and spread one's wings.ural and class myopia that limits perspective and distorts self-understanding.  The White Tiger is a good tonic with which to clear one's vision and spread one's wings.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|Nothing beats an original.  This is a classic movie that should be in every Jane Austins collection.  If you have the newer verison of pride and prejudice with keira knightly and are asking yourself if you should get this, GET IT!!!    The characters are charming.  No one can play Mr Darcy quite like Colin Firth, such a proud actor in this film.  The only one flaw in this movie is that i didnt enjoy Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth, although she is a very good actress.  All the sisters where quite charming except for the one who played Lydia Bennett.  It could be how the character played in the movie.    Just a wonderful wonderful made movie! A joy to watch with a glass of wine and some popcorn
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been exercising for many years and this workout is really tough. It is definitely not for beginners and it is a little harsh on your knees.

0375707972|5.0|Although highly recommended it took me a while to finally read this book. The story seemed too hard to me, but anyway I read it.  It is a very compelling book . The style is clean and direct  without, apparently, any concesion to warmth. But at the end just as Hanna accepts her culpability the reader understands the feelings hidden in the remembrances of Michael.  Hanna as a character is not specially sympathetic but the diference is that we can see her as a a human being while for her the prisioners were nothing. Maybe the book is  so attractive because we can develope that humanity to someone who did inhuman things.

After which, I was so excited about the infinite possibilities that I immediately ordered several more copies for myself and other family and friends.

Yes, being rich takes courage... a lesson I'm learning now :)      Good luck and see you see you at the top!
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I love Madonna and I have every album she has ever put out, but this CD has about 4 good songs on it. The rest is a a waste of listening time. I can't understand why her voice sounds so bad on most of it, but it's almost as if she is in the 80's again before any vocal training. It's just not good.  I just purchased CYNDI LAUPER'S new CD and I am blown away. If you are looking for amazing dance music with a voice to match you are better of with that album. Sorry Madonna, you struck out with this \\"hit.\\" Not sure why it's a hit. I still love her though!
B00005ASOC|5.0|In the twilight of his career, Sean Connery proved he still had it all and gave it all in this awesome tale. While many people will not immediately connect with the characters, it is a story that can grab you when you least expect and truly open your eyes to so many of the truths that are overlooked in our society today.  Connery plays a writer turned recluse named William Forester, who is a real author, and he lives in New York City. He remains in the home of his youth, despite the fact that over time it has changed from a middle class white neighborhood into a overall low income area in which the Black families that live in the area are struggling just to get by.   He meets a prodigy by the name of Jamaal, a young Black man who is in the prime of his High School career and is both a great athlete as he is a great writer. Jamaal suffers from what many other youth suffer from, he fears to be alienated simply because he is smart and enjoys literature. Jamaal is given a scholarship to a top tier NY private school and learns that life is not as different as many thought between the white and black worlds, just different means to the same ends.  Jamaal becomes Connery's pupil and learns to truly express himself via his writing, and while he learns about himself, he forces Connery's to do the same and the two not only become friends, but conquer some of the true challenge's that life presents.   This is a great film, something everyone could enjoy. It will certainly go down as a classic, and one of the best performances Connery graced us with.
078324228X|3.0|The Hurricane: Entertainment Purposes Only    Haven't we learnt that there are always two sides to a story? Norman Jewison's film, The Hurricane; which was released in 1999 is a story that attempts to explain and depict the story of Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter. It fails miserably on this account but superb, indelible acting from the movie's star - Denzel Washington - who plays Rubin Carter, saves this film from being a complete tragedy.  Set in 1966 and encapsulating nearly twenty years of Carter's life, The Hurricane is based upon the trials and conviction of Rubin Carter and his accomplice John Artis for the alleged murder of three people at a bar in New Jersey in 1966. Jewison draws upon Rubin Carter's autobiography The 16th round and Sam Chaiton's Lazarus and the Hurricane. Screenplay is a combination of historical quotes, and fictionalized story.   As director Jewison has done with his previous films, Hurricane's underlying theme is that of racial injustice, and the wrongful imprisonment of Rubin Carter. Historically speaking, the trials of Rubin Carter sparked a great deal of controversy regarding racial injustice, but Jewison presents an entirely lopsided view and inevitably simplifies the plot. The simplification that takes place ignores crucial details, presenting a movie very different from history.  One pitfall Jewison unnecessarily fell into was its glorification of actor Denzel's character - Carter. Carter is portrayed as an innocent boxer; the film even suggests that a white racist cop is targeting him. In reality and history, Carter was arrested because a witness identified the vehicle and the police found matching caliber weapons in the Carter's car. Jewison also left out how Carter had been in jail for four years previously due to a mugging. Jewison irresponsibly paints Carter as a simplified model of the actual Rubin `Hurricane' Carter which strengthens Jewison's overall theme of racial injustice but weakens the movie in terms of its historical accuracy.  Secondly, Jewison exaggerates the racial discrimination and injustice. In opening scenes, clips of cops attacking African American protesters, a racist cop, Carter losing a fight because of racist judges, and an all-white racist jury depict Jewison's view of discrimination. Reality check? The fight against Giardello's win was legitimate according to most of the press and the jury at his trials underwent racial bias tests before being accepted.  Lastly, Jewison brings back thoughts of the film Burning Mississippi, and commits the same mistake of glorifying the wrong heroes. Similar to how the FBI was depicted as saviors in Burning Mississippi, Jewison exalts the Canadians and Lesra as the heroes who attempt to rescue Carter. These are not the true heroes though. As NYT reporter -Selwyn Raab - wrote with the release of Hurricane \\"While glorifying the Canadians, the film plays down the heroic efforts of the lawyers whose strategy finally won the day for Mr. Carter. Overall the film is plagued with historical inaccuracies due to the oversimplification of a more complex issue.   With all that said, Denzel Washington, in his Oscar nominated role, performs extraordinarily well. Denzel's emotionally powerful performance encapsulates the viewer into his struggles of hope and despair. Torn between these two conflicting emotions, Denzel's most powerful scene is when he is sent to solitary confinement - termed the \\"hole\\" for 90 days. Although this scene is criticized as never actually occurring, Jewison must be given acclaim for such a powerful and riveting scene that provides for a more coherent and better movie. In this scene, Denzel undergoes a fierce mental struggle, in which he is torn between two conflicting personalities - one violent, one more conscious - something similar to the angel and the devil cartoon interpretations we're so familiar with. Denzel struggles to choose, and he ends up breaking down and crying to end the scene. Coupled with \\"in-your-face\\" cameraangles, alternating between his two personalities, this scene at the very least will make everyone in the audience silent. It is a real shame that Denzel did not win the Oscar for Best Actor in Leading Role.    Credit to Jewison must be given for his cinematography, which was captivating and was superb during the gripping scenes such like the \\"hole\\" scene. \\"In your face\\" camera shots worked well to allow audience members to feel more involved in the film rather than a sort of bystander.  Along with Denzel's acting and decent acting from other cast members, Hurricane is a brilliant film (not a docudrama).   What Jewison calls his best film may very well be called Denzel's best film instead. Denzel completely ran away with Hurricane, leaving a struggling film trudging behind in a convoluted mix of fact and fiction. Alone, Denzel accomplishes an incredible feat of making an otherwise bad movie good, leaving the audience in astonishment at the end. Nonetheless, a good film to watch for entertainment purposes, and if you want to see a remarkable performance by Denzel Washington. Let me say no more.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|It was watching this series at a friend's house that convinced me to finally make the leap into high definition. This Blu-Ray is simply stunning visually, and the narration on this blu-ray is better than the narration in the television version in my opinion. This is a must buy for anyone with a Blu-Ray player
B000MCH5P4|4.0|**** 2006. Directed by Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu. Three prizes in Cannes, one Academy award and Golden Globe in the Best Picture of the year category. Three stories linked by common themes told by the Mexican director who's definitely a first-rate director. With Guillermo [[ASIN:B000O76ZQC Pan's Labyrinth]] Del Toro, Alfonso [[ASIN:B000N6TX1I Children of Men (Widescreen Edition)]] Cuaron and Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, Mexico is blessed with a new generation of directors who are currently presiding over world cinema. Highly recommended.
184195392X|4.0|The Life of Pi is a most unusual coming-of-age story that begins with our hero and narrator, Pi Patel, recounting his discovery and acceptance of both Christianity and Islam....on top of the Hindu faith of his family!    In Part Two, entitled \\"The Pacific Ocean\\", Martel almost sadistically strips his character of all but the basic necessities of life and has him share a lifeboat with an adult Bengal tiger. This amazing odyssey tugs at our sense of incredulity, yet Martel offers enough morsels of verisimilitude to suspend disbelief.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|I just adore this movie and found myself surfing around during the holidays to see it. Much easier now to have it at the ready. A first rate romantic holdiday feel good movie.
B000ZN802W|2.0|This movie wasn't near as good as I had hoped.  It goes back and forth from the present to the past.  The kid, Chris, is definitely a half bubble off.  Anyone who prepares to live in the wilds of Alaska with just a floral and fauna book is kidding themselves.  I expected more of the Alaska portion of the story.  I really didn't care about the freak shows he meets along the way (i.e. hippies, combine driver, etc.).  They seemed pointless to the story.    This is certainly a movie I would never purchase.  Renting it was about all the value I placed on this DVD.
B0015519VS|5.0|Usher just locked the R&B king title with this album. With two back to back classic albums, he has returned to his thrown with this one. I had been reading in articles since 2006 that he was working on a new album, but he wasnt saying anything about the music, just that it was gonna be legendary. And it was. I also want to add that i am not giving this album five stars because i am a crazy Usher fan that would give anything with Ushers name on it five stars. As a matter of fact, i was really worried that i was gonna have to give this album three stars, because i didnt think that he would be able to live up to Confessions. But he hit it out of the park again, no lie. This album is a lesser to Confessions in only one way, Here I Stand is not an album thats a strait banger like Confessions was. Here I Stand is still gonna get album of the year in my book, and the year is young still, but i already know this is gonna be my favorite at the end of 08. But this album has probably like 12 or 13 excellent tracks, where as Confessions was a strait banger front to back with its original 15 songs. So Here I Stand isnt as good as Confessions, but its mighty close. It the difference between an A and a A-. The first thing i noticed with this album was it has alot different of a sound than Confessions had. This album has alot more of a brighter appeal, while Confessions had that more dark depressing feel in a good way lol. But Here I Stand still more than gets its point across. On the heartbreaking, Dream produced \\"Moving Mountains\\" where Usher lets all of his relationship pain pour out over Dream's light keys and roaring synths. \\"Moving Mountains\\" has the same purpose that \\"Burn\\" did on Confessions, the huge mid tempo ballad of heartbreak for a second single. The same can be said about the very emotionally Stargate produced \\"His Mistakes\\", where Usher tells the story of an untrusting girlfriend over very light piano touches. Than there is the banging baby maker produced by, again, the Dream, \\"Trading Places\\", which is easily one of my favorite tracks on the album because its a different type of babymaker than we are used to from Usher. It has that more echoy babymaking feel instead of the slow jam feel. \\"Before I Met You\\" is another fantastic track with a more up beat feel to it. \\"This Ain't Sex\\" was a sketchy song at first glance, but after a few listens you get hooked to its addicting dance floor feel. It is very reminiscent of some old school MJ stuff. Like i said, this album missed Confessions by a sliver, but it stilled landed in the same ballpark as Confessions, which that alone is difficult to do. Another classic on Ush's hands, means he locked the position as R&B king (Yes Kicking out the legendary R. Kelly). He also said in his article in Hip Hop Soul, \\"Ima let these other R&B cats play with the game til i get back, but once i get back, you better bring your A game.\\" He wasnt playing around either. This is the best album since Confessions, plain and simple!      Grade:  A-
B000UBMWG4|4.0|This was exactly what I was expecting, which was a very well done restoration of an all-time classic movie. The video on this Blu-Ray release looks very very good, as you would expect. Nothing very new here, just a well executed restoration.
1591841666|3.0|seth godin's writing has had a huge impact on me and the company i lead. it was his book, purple cow, that -- about 3 1/2 years ago now -- was the tipping point (ha! title confusion!) into our starting a massive internal campaign of change. so i'm usually pretty quick to pick up godin's new books and devour them.<br /><br />the dip is godin's newest book; and, it seems to me his last couple haven't been as original or strong as previous stuff. this book is one powerful, brilliant, must-read idea: every idea, person and organization goes through a dip (in success, ease, fun, roi, whatever) at some point, often rather early on. it's important to know when to quit (quitting is good) and when to push through the dip.<br /><br />at about 60 pages, the dip is, perhaps, the thinnest, shortest hardcover book i have ever read. here's what's odd: it's way too long. it's such a great idea, and i DO recommend reading it. but it's an article -- a brilliant article -- and should have been 1/3 the length it is.<br /><br />anyhow. if it's worth reading (which it is), and only takes about 30 minutes to read (which it does), there's not a lot of sense in complaining about its wordiness or repetition. lots of personal and organizational application.

B00005B4GU|1.0|I have to admit that Radiohead's first three outings, culminating in OK Computer, were spectacular.  With songs like Creep, The Bends, Fake Plastic Trees, Let Down and Electioneering, they had become the buzz band of the '90's.  Then came Kid A and it's companion Amnesiac.  Disgusting!  Thom Yorke adopts a high, nasally, whiney voice and the critics call it avante garde.  The band starts to play unmusical, atonal mood poems and the critics exclaim that Radiohead have made rock music interesting again.  Au contraire.  This entire album is pretentious crap.  It's only place is to be played in Soho with the band wearing all black, including turtlenecks and berets.  Real Rock'n'Roll has a soul, which this does not.  Radiohead had a soul up until OK Computer.  It's shown it's head in spurts on Hail to the Thief and In Rainbows, but is still hiding behind all this pretentious BS.  Let's hope they snap out of it, stop investigating their own navels and return to producing music for the real world, not a bunch of godforsaken critics.

B000WQWPKA|5.0|I first saw this at its opening in 1996 and it was the block buster of the summer. The transfer to blu looks really good (a little grainy in spots and may be the print, but I never noticed). as with most really good blu-rays you get lost in the movie and forget about the technology pretty quickly since the quality is so good.  The sound is absolutely spectacular and will give your subwoofer a workout. I cant believe this is over 10 years old but is a clasic summer block buster movie.   a must have for your blu ray collection
B0000ADY9I|5.0|It's pretty simple, really. The Allman Brothers Band was one of the greatest live bands ever, and this recording best shows what they could do. The sound quality is superb, the artwork, liner notes, packaging, etc. are all great. And this \\"deluxe\\" package enhances the original version. Honestly, if you enjoy live music and great musicianship, this is an album you should have.
B00005JPD0|5.0|I've seen Denzel Washington in a few movies I didn't like, but usually he is excellent in every way.  That's how he is in this movie too.  My husband and I love this movie and will watch it over and over. There are all these clues that you don't realize until later that they are important, but I like the way everything is wrapped up by the end.  You never quite know how it is going to turn out until then. It has a sad ending, and then a happy ending!  It's a great movie!

This book definately is a spark for boys.

B0013FBS20|5.0|picture transfer is really good. has the same feel as the theatre  viewing experience. the sound will make you jump. Get the disc just for the alternative ending!. it was a real conversation piece to show both. The quality make you get lost in the film quickly. The graphics look intensly real, especially on a big screen. the detail is so clear you can actually catch some of the minute editing and composting into the graphics, that you would never see at the theatre.  I highly recommend it!
B000YD7F10|5.0|This has been one of my favorite albums for 30 years.  It's great to have it in CD format now.  Still love it!
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|This movie always keeps you guessing. Will it have a good ending or a bad ending? You are never quite sure and all the plot twists and action keep you tense and wondering.  We usually like Nicholas Cage (he's had a few crummy movies) and he doesn't disappoint here. We had to buy it so we could watch it over and over.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Saw the movie 3 times now and will probably watch it again.  I thought the whole storyline and outcome was excellent.  I hope that MGM continues making the Stargate movies for as long as they can.
0201485672|4.0|What is better? Replacing delegations with inheritance or replacing inheritance with delegation?     The answer is the ultimate answer to most software engineering decisions: DEPENDS, there is always a trade-off that has to be analyzed according to the context! This book addresses those trade-offs very well.    Moreover, I like the examples in the book, good to use in class when teaching. They generate interesting discussions.
B0013N4AT0|5.0|I already held \\"Still Life\\" as one of my top 5 CDs, so the 5.1 mix enticed me to buy this.  Definitely a good choice!    The \\"CD\\" portion of this package is just the same old \\"Still Life\\" with a slight fix on some of the audio.  It no longer drops in places (such as the moor) but you won't get anything else new.  The CD is just a nice addition to replace your old one.    The real seller is the 5.1 audio DVD.  One quick warning though: there is no LFE channel in the mix, so technically it was only mastered for 5.0.  This is not to say your sub wont work, just that there wasn't a dedicated channel to the lower frequencies.  It has plenty of bass, it just wasn't mastered in true 5.1  Don't let that dissuade you though, the sound is quite superb.    The use of the surround speakers to add ambiance to the music is great, and the center channel pushes Akerfeldt's voice right out.  The mix is absolutely amazing, and the music sounds totally different and new (in a good way of course).  The acoustic guitars and some leads sound as if they were re-recorded (very apparent in Benighted), and the music takes on a different dynamic, becoming more drastic in changes from crunch to clean. (if you can imagine \\"Still Life\\" having more drastic dynamics)    All in all, a solid re-mix and re-master.  The bonus footage of Face of Melinda live is great as well.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|This film was enjoyable, but it lacked realism. I don't recall if they first ever figured out where this creature came from. I saw several editing errors. It was fun to watch, but it was a cheap effort to reflect on the old Japanese horror films (i.e. Godzilla).

0374105235|4.0|This book was very interesting and I could not put it down.  It is no fantastically written piece of literature, but the story draws you in and will not let you go.
1416914293|1.0|No, definitely not. The first book was sort of OK, the writing was better, the plot more gripping. But even the first novel suffered from this special kind of fascism that the genre seems to admire: all this \\"Übermenschen\\"-stuff: this killing, blood-splitting, flesh-disrupting, intestines-devouring rubbish. No! City of Ashes is pulp-fiction of the worst kind. Cassandra Clare changes from embarassing scenes of \\"teenage-schnulziness\\" (I have to apologize for my German background)to embarassing scenes of gory weaponism. I know I know: we are so proud of our youngsters when only they read. And we name whatever they put before their eyes a book if only this item seems to consist of letters which seem to make up a story of the clumsiest sort.
B00005JPNY|5.0|I found this film to be anyone's adventure. No matter your age, if you can remember games we played, or are still playing, you can find a connection to it. The CGI images are extroenary and plentiful. I invite anyone who has an adventurous sprit, to bring this film home and enjoy it with the entire family.
B0012GMVXU|3.0|For my taste, 'Ain't No Cure for Love\\" is the keeper on this CD, but I have friends who like \\"First We'll Take Manhattan\\" or \\"I'm Your Man\\" or \\"Tower of Song\\" better. I like the last three better by artists other than Leonard, and in fact, \\"Ain't No Cure\\" is even done better by Jennifer Warnes. As with most Cohen albums I've heard over 40 years, his love lyrics, happy or sad, are his strong suit. Overall, this is weaker than \\"Various Positions\\" and I recommend that one, and also his Greatest Hits stuff from the '60's and '70's, ahead of \\"I'm Your Man.\\"

B0009IQLPG|4.0|Two discs approximately 41 min. each.  Remastered.  Savoy Brown was never as popular as other British blues groups of the sixties-groups like John Mayall,Fleetwood Mac,or any other first run groups.  They were more of a second tier group like Chicken Shack or Groundhogs.  Savoy Brown became popular in America later on in their career as a \\"boogie\\" band-with all the good and bad that entails.  Having said that,their first few albums fit in with the '60's blues boom then in fashion in England.<br /><br /> The first album Shake Down was especially immediate-in your face-sounding.  The songs consisted mainly of covers written by well-known blues artists like Willie Dixon John Lee Hooker and the like.  The instrumental The Doormouse Rides The Rails gives guitarist Martin Stone a chance to shine.  The lead singer Brice Portius is adequate-neither great nor bad.  The rhythm section is what you would expect from this time.  A combination of slow blues and a few shuffles make up this recording.  Only on the last song does the group show a tendency to stretch out in a \\"boogie\\" like style that they would go on to make popular in America,which is to bad.  For those of you interested in British groups in this style I would recommend you pick up this disc.  It was never originally released in America and had to be bought as an import.<br /><br />The second album Getting To The Point,was a continuation of the first as far as the British blues sound.  With a new singer on board,Chris Youlden,Savoy Brown's sound became a bit more distinctive.  Martin Stone had left to join Mighty Baby and the rhythm section had changed too.  Most of the songs are now being written by the team of Youlden/Simmonds (the band's new lead guitarist).  As before it is a combination of fast and slow blues,with an instrumental to show what Kim Simmonds could do.<br /><br />This album and the next few would follow the same path.  Only later would Savoy Brown descend into \\"boogie\\" excess that became popular and thus spell the end of their truly blues playing days.  All in all I would say buy these two albums if you're a fan of British blues or sixties music from England in general.d thus spell the end of their truly blues playing days.  All in all I would say buy these two albums if you're a fan of British blues or sixties music from England in general.

I don't care much for Schrott's delivery of Figaro's  act four aria, however. Toni Bernhard likes the Gardiner, but to me, only Terfel shines.If the one from the Met ever makes an appearance, Terfel, Fleming & Bartoli will make that one the live performance to get. If You don't have to have a live performance, then get the DG Unitel. Prey, Te Kanawa & Freni put this one at the top.

B0016B6ZKG|3.0|I would have liked this cd better if it was all dance music.  instead, it is a mixture of various musical genres, including pop, blue grass, and Celine Dion type contemporary ballads.  It's like a musical tour that tries to cover too much ground taking you on one trip and then bringing you back down.  I like an album to be consistant, especially when you involve club dance music.  \\"Crayons\\" lives up to it's title, it's like a crayola box of crayons with hundreds of different colours.  I love the songs \\"Stamp Ur Feet\\", and \\"I'm A Fire\\".  They are classic dance songs by Donna Summer.  \\"Science of Luv\\" is a good pop jam, and \\"The Queen is Back\\" is a campy self congradualtory jam much like Mary J. Blige's \\"MJB The MVP\\" except Mary's song is better.  Donna Summer threw me off with cuts like \\"Drivin' Down Brazil\\" and \\"Bring Down The Reign\\".  I just couldn't sit through them because I was still reeling off the dance vibe, making me crave more club music.  If Donna had made an entire cd like \\"I'm A Fire\\", this cd would have been classic.  But Donna is still the queen of dance, just lay off the blue grass, girl.
B000026WTJ|5.0|Prepare to be electrified. Out of the many live albums I've heard, I think this is the best one, and while it's totally clich&eacute; to say this, I don't care. This is the live album! It's the sound of the world ending! It's the Who raising hell for seventy-seven minutes, earning their chops as the world's loudest live band. They slash and burn their way through hit singles \\"I Can't Explain\\", \\"Happy Jack\\", \\"Substitute\\" and \\"I'm a Boy\\"; let Pete get his guitar hero going on a fifteen-minute \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks\\"; and turn \\"Magic Bus\\" from a fun, light little ditty into absolute self-destruction for guitar and harmonica, and take \\"My Generation\\" off in a million different ways. It's great to hear what they do to it! So first, it's \\"My Generation\\" and nothing more. But... but then it becomes \\"See Me, Feel Me\\", then it becomes Roger shouting, \\"Farewell! Farewell!\\" while the rest of the band causes all kinds of cool mayhem, and then Pete Townshend shows any hopeful lead guitarists in the crowd how it's done. It's a shame Pete so rarely solos on the Who's studio records, because he's really good at it. Anyway, you thought you knew \\"My Generation\\"? You haven't heard \\"My Generation\\" until you've heard \\"My Generation\\" at Leeds on Valentine's Day in 1970. And then, the matter of the covers. Who covers had always been rather shaky in the studio. Not so much live. Roger sounds confident, charismatic, and cool on \\"Fortune Teller\\" and \\"Shakin' All Over\\", two old R&B standards converted into aural ballistic missiles. And he defines \\"frontman\\" on \\"Young Man's Blues\\", the Mose Allison tune that inspired \\"My Generation\\". You know, the kind who would seem arrogant as hell if he weren't so gripping and so into what he was singing. That's how he is there. I can just picture him, strutting around the stage, snarling to the crowd, \\"The young man... ain't got nothin'... he ain't got sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeet nothin'!' as everybody watched his act in absolute awe. That's just how it's done. It doesn't matter how good of a singer you are, it matters how good of an entertainer you are. Roger wins. And \\"Summertime Blues\\" might be the loudest song in my collection. It's an ear-buster. Don't listen to it too loud, or your head might explode! And you know something else? I love it. This time it's John who runs the show, adding a hilarious basso-profundo while Keith Moon goes even more crazy than he does on the rest of the record and Pete plays rhythm guitar worthy of Keith Richards. Holy Christmas, these guys ruled live. Oh, oh, and there's a John Entwistle song here, too! \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is another in a long line of his black-humored rampages, and it consists of a battle of the mad axe-men. Now, there are a couple of moments when the group lets up the intensity, but don't think that hurts the album at all. Oh, no. \\"Tattoo\\" is one example, though Moon ruins it (but makes it better!) by playing these stupid (but awesome!) drum fills. Song's a hoot, too. That's one of the many wonderful fringe benefits of being found on The Who Sell Out. And \\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\" manages to better the studio version by adding a cool guitar solo! And yes, they still do sing \\"cello, cello, cello\\" during the dramatic parts. I find that funny. And really, this little bugger has everything you need for a perfect Who recipe. Humor. Artiness. Volume. Bombast. Virtuosity. And, though all this chaos, melody. This album is the Who.'t matter how good of a singer you are, it matters how good of an entertainer you are. Roger wins.

0688091717|5.0|This is a wonderful book! I am an art teacher and use it in my classroom to teach patterns. When I read it to my students (K-2) they laugh and giggle and just love it. It is also a great story to teach children that being different is aok and even something others may wish they were.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I had never seen this movie before I bought it on here but I'm so glad I went ahead and got it. It's a wonderful Jane Austen movie with a great story. Different from any of the other one's I've seen but I think that's why I enjoyed it so much. I just feel completely in love with it!
B0001KZM3O|5.0|-We've (the Floydians) come to...    Pump    You    Up    ENABLE: Tough Love... LOL(z)    ---First off, I don't care if you do or don't believe what you read today on the internet here today, nor will bicker with a prissy boy who drank too much milk that was contaminated BHTs and feels the need to have the last word (AKA girly man).    ---This album wasn't a \\"solo\\" and it didn't grow from a new idea. This is* at least 4 songs that were salvaged from remnants of cut/deleted scenes from the Wall (imagine X(sign here)_______________ dressed in parliamentary wig & dress, holding a large pair of shears while what became the Final Cut, hit the cutting room floor). I have never viewed* the original cuttings, but have recently seen what was claimed to be actual footage for sale on eBay in PAL cassette. I had believed Gilmour would have secured this in a vault for whatever reason he felt was right/just, but found he had even hosted (highly protected) on his own site for some time, what was in fact, at least part of the clippings, that he stated would be \\"too traumatic for American viewers\\".    ---This is* part of the Wall. Ignorance (the lack of knowing) will say it's not, but ignorance would say just that about anything now wouldn't it? If you weren't sitting in front of the radio, tuned to the Loop (97.9 WLUP-FM) when the release of the album was announced, you didn't hear it, so you wouldn't know. If you hadn't at least seen the videos that Gilmour had on his* website, removed 4 years ago, you wouldn't even have a clue to the truth. So, don't be ignorant, listen for once.    ---Furthermore, we (as a generation) don't care what you think or feel, cause we have our own thoughts & feelings. If you don't get it, we won't waste our time even trying to explain and most certainly know beating it into you will be even more a waste. Eventually we just build a wall to separate ourselves from the stupidity that leads to ignorance and once in a while poke our heads out to say something of importance.    ---Even by itself this is a great recording, just like every and any Floydwork. Take it for what it is and if you don't like it, who cares. Those who would buy Classic rock such as Pink Floyd, don't want to hear you whining about how you \\"bought this... \\" when you really downloaded it. Who cares that you wasted your bandwidth. So what, you wasted your time. Quit wasting ours.    ---If you don't buy it, that leaves more for us...  ... and we will buy it, already have bought it, more than once.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|This is a great CD, I have it and ordered it for a friend that just had a baby and she loves it as well.  It brings tears to my eyes everytime I listen to it.
B00005QXXO|4.0|A compilation of what I believe to be the Kid Amnesiac-era tour, considering that out of these eight songs, three are from Amnesiac and four are from Kid A. And really, that's all I can come up with about this album. It's certainly good, but it's only necessary for the converted. However, if you are converted, you'll find that there's a lot to like, including the huge reworking of \\"Like Spinning Plates\\", when it becomes a thoroughly beautiful piano ballad! Yes, that's right, it goes from some crazed, frigged-out avant-techno experiment to that! How did that happen? Well, however it happened, I like it. \\"Dollars and Cents\\" is also massively improved upon, removing the freaky noises and as such turning it into a somewhat great song. And the moody \\"True Love Waits\\", which never made it on a studio album, is the other fantastic highlight. Thom Yorke's falsetto and his acoustic guitar are a very good combination. On the other hand, \\"Morning Bell\\", \\"Idioteque\\", and \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" are nothing to write home about. If you've heard the originals (and I'm assuming you have), you're heard the remakes. They don't do anything particularly wrong, since \\"Morning Bell\\" and \\"Idioteque\\" so happen to be two of the best songs from Kid A (same with \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" on Amnesiac). It's just that, given what they do to \\"Like Spinning Plates\\", there was so much more potential. Come to think of it, the only song I'm really unimpressed by is \\"The National Anthem\\". Yorke's vocals just don't do the job for me, and the barely audible vocal scatting taking the place of the crazy horn section ruins the song. Let's face it, two or three people singing scat isn't going to wipe you out the way a horn section blowing whatever they please does. The remake of \\"Everything in Its Right Place\\" isn't the best, either. Still, it's interesting to hear Radiohead take some of their most challenging songs and put them in a live format, most of the songs are good, and none of them is bad. So it's a worthwhile addition to any Radiohead collection.e addition to any Radiohead collection.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD is wonderful. There isn't a song on it that I dislike. Every song is topnotch. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who would like a near heaven experience.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|I will admit that I am not very familiar with Machine Head, aside from some of the history I've read online about the band.    I read that this album was one of (if not, THE) highest rated metal album of 2007. Of course, one not to miss out on a great album from a great genre, I had to go out and pick this one up.    I can say this is easily the best album I've heard in a long time. So much so that I'm putting it on my top 5 albums of all time! I was definitely impressed to say the least.    I can see why this is called their masterpiece. Everything from the lyrics, to the riffs, basslines, and insane solos is truly something to behold.    Anyone looking for inspiration to angry music, something new to check out, or even just to headbang to, then this album is for you.
B000005HDT|5.0|While Miles Davis was making dark, brooding, introspective electric jazz,(which I love with all my heart,) Donald Byrd decided to investigate the other end of the spectrum.<br /><br />This music is light and joyous funk, with tight vocal arrngements and a fantastic session band. Byrd took the same vocal ideas he used on New Perspective, and applied them to Sly Stone grooves. This coctail resulted in sleek but subtinative music. Sweet, fat licks that you bite into like a chocolate cherry. Commercial? Yes. Top 40 material, absolutely. Right up there on 70s radio with Barry White and Steely Dan. Not bad company, right?<br /><br />Music you can listen to any time of day. Perfect.
0385340540|1.0|Hate to say it, but about 300 pages of this book were unncessary. The entire \\"leanin to talk Italian\\" portion was a waste of time since it had almost no bearing on the plot, nor did it get me to care about the main character. Didn't really develop the guy at all. The story was plausible, but couldn't figure out if it wanted to be a love story, inner-person struggle, or spy novel. Too bad - Grisham's early work was so good, and now it's come to this. Best part - the author's disclaimer at the end about how he doesn't know about technology, spies, espinoage, etc. but wrote a book and took my money. Pretty cheap.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|As I have yet to view this version of the movie, I did purchase it based on my acceptance of the Director's Cut.  This item shipped in 5 days when it was estimated from 2-12 days.  This item arrived in pristine condition, wrapped in plastic.  This is an excellent movie that I highly recommend, along with recommending the seller (A+ IMO) for my next purchase.  It was indeed a pleasure doing business with this seller.
B000001FMX|4.0|Only after the passage of time can one determine whether or not an LP is a classic.  Well, time has been awfully good to the New York Dolls as both of their official LPs have more than held up on the test of time.  Their first LP is a confident sounding release chock full of good rockin' catchy tunes.  The band plays with a sense of wild abandon that is infectious.  David Johansen's werewolf-in-heat vocals ride atop a heavy kinetic surge of cross-firing guitars, bass and drums.  This is an LP that can't be missed and should be a part of your CD collection if you have an insatiable taste for classic garage/punk rock.
B000FA57N0|5.0|Love FireFly? You will love this movie and the HDDVD version is outstanding. Good Sci-Fi Westerns are hard to come by!
B000VR824S|5.0|As far as concert videos goes, this one's a gem; although, much of the good stuff from an eleven-hour program was left on the cutting room floor. This release really needed to be a triple. Some of my favorites on the released discs were JohnnyWinter's contribution, SusanT's and hubby DerekT's, AlbertLee's. The entire 1-hr JeffBeck set was superb with amazing and HOT-bassist TalWilkenfeld; it was a pity that only 3 of the songs played from that set made it to the release. Clapton and Winwood were magic together. One of the most magical moments of the entire day was when E cozied right up next to DerekT during \\"Why Does Love Got to be so Sad\\" to play double leads - two separate, yet, complimenting leads. DT played slide and E bent notes so rigorously as to simulate a slide guitar. The song appears on the BonusDisc, but the sound mix on that disc was flawed. If you can get a copy of the MSN-feed video discs, do it. The video won't be digital quality but still similar to a good VHS. At least the sound is right! In summary, the product is excellent, and we could all quibble about what selections made it to disc and which would be cut, but I'd argue that a third disc was warranted. I hope that the next CGF is on the West Coast and includes Roy Rogers.
B00009RGBS|5.0|what a great dvd have it on vhs but nothing like the dvd.  people who get these dvds should know to pull them out once in awhile to view
1423101464|5.0|There is nothing to dislike about this 4th entry in the Percy Jackson series.  The action, dialogue, suspense, and humor are plentiful.  The mixing of ancient gods with current culture is well-done and insightful.<br /><br />Best of all, everyone in my family plowed right through the book and had some great conversations about the situations and problems that arose.<br /><br />Read this instead of seeing Prince Caspian at the multiplex.
B000ZN802W|1.0|Into the Wild is a movie that's based off of the Jon Krakauer (just your ordinary, average, former fisherman who assumed he could become a writer not through education, but by merely being an outdoorsman-wannabe) novel (in itself a pitiable joke as it's really only a cheating expansion of Krakauer's 1993 article, \\"Death of an `Innocent,'\\" from Outside magazine) of the same name. As such, there's been some volatile temptation to go out and call this unoriginal movie a \\"drama,\\" \\"biopic,\\" \\"action,\\" or even \\"adventure\\" flick. NO, NO, NO and NO!!!! All the aforementioned, wrongly used descriptions of this film are totally off since the actual category Into the Wild truly, honestly belongs to is horror. That's right: H-O-R-R-O-R! This is a film that should get the award for the most blood-curdling, spine-chilling and unsettling horror flick of all time, easily besting predictable candidates like The Exorcist or Friday the 13th.<br /><br />The reason for my easily convincing categorization of Into the Wild as a horror movie is because the story--which is real, by the way, making it EVEN MORE SCARY--is so disturbing that it just upsets one's normal and natural notions of what constitutes decency among people. See, the story revolves around the late Chris McCandless who, because of his maniacally unsafe and attention-planned exploits, should ironically be called Chris McCandiea*s, a true liberal in every horrifying sense of the word. As such, as Into the Wild proves, he embodied all the disreputable qualities of liberalism, which ultimately led to his death: delusional idealism, a lack of a functional plan, directionless tendencies, being anti-establishment, anti-capitalism, arrogant altruism, insanity, and, ultimately, self-destruction (how all liberal ideologies eventually end up, ie. Communism et al).<br /><br />McCandless had the makings for the foundation of a successful life since he was a college student at Emory University with about $24000 in savings. Then, bizarrely and mournfully, liberalism seized control of his exorbitantly gullible way of thinking. After evil liberalism got its hold on him, McCandless really started perpetrating the epitome of what sane, responsible people can only rightly deride as \\"stupid stuff.\\"<br /><br />His first perpetration of the aforementioned \\"stupid stuff\\" is--in a classic yet corny clich&eacute; of liberal rebellion against his apparently materialistic father--squandering his $24000 in savings (pretty decent for a college kid!) by donating it to social justice (oxymoron if there ever was one) outfit Oxfam, a liberal organization that has its head in the sand since its implausible mission is to find solutions to poverty!!!! Clearly, Oxfam's \\"work\\" is so implausible that it's even dumber than what the libs mock President Bush for when he christened the post-911 response the \\"War on Terror.\\" Ironically, if McCandless' ploy was really to help the poor, he should've stayed in college and gotten a degree, which would've enabled him to earn more money. Then, once he held a job, he could've really contributed in more meaningful ways to idiot organizations like Oxfam all he wanted, certainly amounting to more net donations over the course of his working career than a one-time donation of $24000.<br /><br />Anywho, McCandiea*s'--whoops, sorry, I meant to write \\"McCandless'\\"--\\"stupid stuff\\" syndrome continues when he basically decides to lose his everlovin' mind in the pursuit of his confusingly insane, ultimate goal. Are you ready for this, folks? I'm not kidding; here it is: to drive cross-country in his economy car (read: vehicle which will never get him laid...ever!) to live alone and off the land in barren Alaska!?! WTF????<br /><br />Right at this pivotal point, it was clear that I was watching a most grisly, horror movie because it was frightening beyond belief to see a liberal's hazardously insane thought process displayed in such stark reality on the big screen. I also felt the horror in this horror movie by the overwhelmingly noticeable theme of self-hatred and self-destructive nihilism in McCandless' seeming descent into liberal, mental disorder. See, his goal of living in Alaska (for which he ultimately died because of mindless lack of preparation) after sacrificing a budding, college career is the epitome of suicidal tendencies to me and many other sane reviewers.<br /><br />But, wait for it: McCandless' expose of why liberalism is such a brain-dead ideology is starkly showcased in even more episodes of self-destructive thoughtlessness. You know, I might even be tempted into thinking of Into the Wild as a laughable, slapstick comedy due to the hopeless and bumbling, self-inflicted demise of McCandless, yet I still classify it as a horror movie due to the serious consequences.<br /><br />McCandless, still on his way to that barren wasteland  called Alaska, somehow manages to lose his babe-magnet, his economy car, in a flash flood! Then, because this late dork actually was so anti-capitalism that he burned what little cash he had left on him, he resorted to hitchhiking, ending up taking about two years to get to Alaska! Never mind the fact that most parents will agree that hitchhiking is very unsafe (and so this film glorifies irresponsible, personal misconduct, too), the aforementioned unfolding of McCandless' dumb*ss journey is so aimless and disorderly that it would be a great slapstick comedy in the tradition of The Three Stooges, were it not so real-life tragic.<br /><br />McCandless' self-inflicted, miserable journey of his mentally disordered, liberal mind continues when, after finally arriving in the \\"promised land\\" (AKA, Alaska), he takes to living inside a bus...seriously. Dubbed the hippie-and-stupid-sounding \\"Magic Bus,\\" McCandless' already on-the-fritz mind takes a turn for the worse as he actually deludes himself into being convinced that he \\"enjoys\\" this sordid existence!!!! So, what does the liberal-in-training do next? You'd think that maybe, just maybe, he'd snap back to reality and get some common sense, finally, right? HELL NO!!!! Instead of realizing how the liberal ideologies of anti-capitalism, environMENTALism and hippiedom have landed him--as Gordon Ramsay would say--in the s**t, this clown actually starts writing a book about his slapstick misadventures. WTF????<br /><br />At this point in the film--and, I kid you not, dear people reading this--I was all-out in tears, bawling my little eyes out because of the grief I felt at what liberalism had cruelly done to a once-budding, idealistic college student! I mean, look at McCandless at this point in this horror movie: he's friggin' destitute, lives in a friggin' \\"bus,\\" probably smells rancid, and has no foreseeable hope for his future!!!!<br /><br />Nonetheless, gathering up my last shreds of courage, I managed to soldier on in the face of this showcase of harmful, liberal ideology in McCandless' life and watch Into the Wild into conclusion. McCandless' self-inflicted death served him right and was the just deserts he earned after living in such a reckless, suicidal state of mind. The film details how--being the genius he was (sarcasm fully intended!)--this clown then failed to plan for the Alaskan, spring thaw, which ended up separating him from food because of the onset of increased waterways. So, brilliant liberal thinker that he is (why, he's just about a regular Al \\"I invented the Internet\\" Gore or Barack HUSSEIN Obamster), he resorts to eating plants as the food lessens.<br /><br />However, as any half-sane person should or could anticipate, not all plants in the wild are gosh-darn safe enough to consume, a pitfall which ultimately and mercifully ends McCandless' sordid life. Despite being the half-nit he was by having brought along a trusty book to guide him on the edibility of plants--wouldn't you know it?--this great, liberal thinker STILL CONFUSES a poisonous kind of plant for--hahaha, and here's where The Three Stooges comedy really kicks in, folks--an edible kind! Only, unlike slapstick comedy, this turned out to be mortal for old McCandless!<br /><br />That's how Into the Wild ends: it essentially fulfills the foreshadowed prophecy of a liberal clown who decides to make one reckless and radicalized misjudgment after another until he kills himself. Into the Wild is essentially a very horrifying and painful window into something called long-term suicide that this liberal loon, McCandless, plotted ever since deciding to desert college and become a hippie. Based on this disclosure and analysis of Into the Wild, all the disingenuous apologists and outright promoters of this film should be ashamed of themselves because there's nothing meaningful or praiseworthy here. The only thing there is is McCandless' STUPID STUFF!!!!, finally, right? HELL NO!!!!

B000066744|5.0|This is exactly what movies were meant to be...heartwarming, a musical feast for the ears, historically-accurate and detailed sets and costumes, superb acting, and a story-line that completely pulls you into the tale. This movie deserved far more acclaim and awards that initially received and should go down as a must-see CLASSIC for future generations. A great way to introduce students to history, jazz, and the finest of film making with a story so real that you'll need to find out if it is based upon fact.
B000VAQX0A|5.0|When I first started seeing \\"Gold\\" CDs in the mid-80s I thought it was just another way to get me to pay more money for basically the same quality as aluminum-substrate CDs.  In other words, I thought it was all...hype.    I even had a Tower Records employee tell me, \\"The only difference is that the gold doesn't oxidize as fast.\\"  (Given the intellectual level of the average Tower employee, that he used \\"oxidize\\" was impressive enough.)  Which, while true, it also tells me that the guy had either never heard one of the discs or didn't have access to even mid-level audio equipment.    So I've been laboring under a 25+ yr delusion that Gold CDs were a marketing ploy.    Well, I've justed listened to Mobile Fidelity's \\"Permanent Waves\\", Special Limited Edition no. 3042.  (I read somewhere that only 5000 are made, if so I got lucky since I almost passed it up.)    Not only was a I wrong, I was DEAD WRONG.  I feel like such an idiot.  I could have--SHOULD HAVE--all of MoFi's Rush editions.  Now they are going for $100 and up (if nothing more than an investment!).  The wife--sadly, like most women, a Rush-hater--ain't gonna go for dropping that kind of cash.    As for the sound quality I concur absolutely with many of the reviewers: this is simply the best sounding \\"Permanent Waves\\" I've ever heard, and I've owned FOUR previous editions (LP, Cassette, un-Remastered CD and Remastered [\\"The Rush Remasters\\"] CD) and this blows them ALL away.      The sound quality is breathtaking.  I used the \\"STRAIGHT\\" setting on my Yahama HTR-6050 Receiver so that none of its decoders would alter the sound out-put from my Toshiba HD-A30 (yes, it's an HD-DVD player, it's also a d*mn good CDDA player).  Only in concert (esp on this last tour) have these songs sounded better.    Geddy's bass: clean and punchy; sharp and fat at the same time (Rush fans should know exactly what I mean), something rarely fully captured on disc (\\"Power Windows,\\" even pre-remastering, was an excellent example--anddon't I wish I had that Mo-Fi version of that!).      Alex's guitar: Mr. Lifeson's guitar ranges from shimmering (the 12-string on \\"Natural Science\\"), to the emotive scream of \\"Spirit of Radio's\\" solo, to the measured, martial pace of the mid-section of \\"Jacob's Latter.\\"  (The last being the only Rush song ever called \\"beautiful\\" by a Rolling Stone reviewer--not that we Rush fans CARE what Rolling Stone thinks anyway.)    Neil's percussion: probably the most amazing thing about this disc is the complete fidelity to his \\"old\\" kit, with its plethora of percussive devices both familiar and bizarre.    The tympanis on \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", to give one example, reverberate so cleanly it was almost as if I could reach out and touch them.  His snare snaps back with a wicked authority so many drummers aim for and so very, very few achieve.    The only better sounding disc I've ever heard are SACD's, e.g. Coltrane's \\"Lush Life\\" and Janine Jansen's \\"Four Seasons\\".  Of course, even this disc doesn't equal an SACD, but it's closer than anything else.    I could write 10,000 words about this gem of a remastered disc.  But Amazon only allows 1000 and I doubt most folks would want to read it.    For an album I've listened to on at least a weekly basis since 1983, if not daily, I was further surprised as how many \\"new\\" things I discovered from this single listen.  (Needless to say, there'll be many more.)  The opening tidal pools of \\"Natural Science\\" to the closing crash of the in-coming tide reminded me so much of La Jolla Shores it was eerie.    Hugh Syme's piano work on \\"Different Strings\\" is also beautifully rendered.  I don't know if he was playing a Steinway grand--it certainly sounded like it.  Whatever it was, few of my \\"classical\\" piano CDs sound this pure.  The fidelity is so good that at the end of this track I can hear what I believe Alex's pick tapping a pick-up.  It's THAT good.    If you're a Rush fan and an audiophile (and aren't the two really synonyms?), you simply MUST have this disc.    Let's hope this disc sells enough copies to warrant yet more Rush albums from MoFi's Magical Mixing Laboratory.  They deserve it--and so do we.    I only hope that more Rush CDs are coming from MoFi's Magic Mixing Laboratory.    The cover art also wasn't quite what I expected.  It looked like it was done with a low-end HP copier/scanner.  I think we deserve better for the $26.99 paid.  Hopefully, future Rush releases (if there are any) will correct this flaw.  The only flaw in the release.    Finally, HUGE props to Shawn R. Britton (of MoFi) who did the remastering job.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Gilmour-Waters (and to an extent the rest of floyd) are one of rock's great songwriting teams, creating some of the most powerful and trail-blazing music ever recorded. Since the split, Waters\\" solo work has provided evidence that he was the band's central \\"brain\\" & conceptualist with a focus on biting lyrics and almost operatic rock.    If there was ever doubt, this album makes clear that Gilmour, more than any other band member, was Floyd's romantic heart. There is none of the biting lyrics or political commentary that Waters brought to the table here. Rather, this album is filled with gorgeous atmospheric music that goes right to the heart. Gilmour appears mellower, wiser and playing with greater nuance than ever, sometimes sounding like Jeff Beck.     Island is for anyone who likes mellow romantic music and who loved the lush beautiful soundscapes of Floyd's bes work. Download this album, slap on your head phones and prepare to be transported.    My only request to the artist -- pls don't make us wait another decade or two for the next solo album!
B0015519VS|5.0|Undoubtebly, I can't deny that this album is very good. I really didn't know what to expect from Usher this time around. I honestly wrote it off before I had heard it.  I had heard little about it, even with the single \\"Love In the Club\\" being released. That song immediatly turned me off. The theme is simply dumb and it annoyed me. It still does. Yet I came across an article yesterday online that really changed my mind. I've been an Usher fan from the very beginning of his career. Many people have not heard his debut album, Usher, but outside of this album, I really love that one the best. Confessions was good, but his debut album was really good, especially for a kid off of the starting blocks. But Here I Stand is great. I listened, and there were only a couple of songs that I did not like. The title cut is Here I Stand was put together beautifully. I loved his total honesty in Appetite. Trading Places is an awesome, sexy cut. It's real. It's a song that lovers can really relate to. There are many other things to be said about this album, but suprisingly I do recommend listening to this album. It's worth your time.
0446402389|4.0|Sometimes debut novels, while good, are under-developed. Not so with Child 44. It's a fully-formed, mature book that I found easy to read. The plot is complex and the characters are rich. If you're interested in how life was during height of Soviet Russia, this book lends some color. Highly recommended.
B000002URV|3.0|I first heard this CD back in 1993 from a friend who brought it back from Czechoslovakia when he moved here, and I thought it was great. For 1993, it was hip, fun, and different from the trash and alternative music out there. I was a fan of Enya back then (still am), so Enigma's strange quasi-techno beats and rythms appealed to me. I bought MCMXC A.D. back in 2003 because I was looking for some relazing music, and 10 years hadn't changed my perception of the still strange rythms, sound effects, synthe pads, and ambiance.<br />This won't appeal to everyone, but for those who are looking for a unique listening experience that blends dance, strange sound effects, techno, and some 90's hip-hop beats, check out MCMXC A.D.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|I have been a fan of the series but never got to see the last season so I bought it. It was pretty good but had hoped for more I guess.  If you are a fan it's a must have for your collection.  Not exactly family friendly but there are some good messages to be found.
0452289963|5.0|If you want to free yourself from self-inflicted suffering, read this book.  Tolle gives the clearest explanation of our human dilemma I've ever read.  I've been a student of human nature since 1965 and was a transpersonal psychotherapist for 20 years.  I've read many books on the subject and studied many approaches. As with his other books, \\"Power of Now\\" and \\"Stillness Speaks,\\" reading \\"A New Earth\\" is a transformative experience in itself.    I don't agree with every word, but if I had to recommend just one book to everyone on this planet, it would be this one.  READ IT and help transform consciousness on our endangered planet before it's too late for all of us.
B0016B6ZKG|3.0|Seems like this is the year for some great comebacks...and some not so good...The whole album is OK, but the real deal is HER VOICE...One of the best.
1881273156|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful book for anyone wanting to understand how to effectively love their spouse!
1569242739|5.0|Read an article about this book in a newspaper and planned to buy it for a friend who's son is allergic to eggs, and ended up buying one for myself too! My family isn't vegetarian, but we don't eat a lot of meat, so didn't see any reason why we had to have eggs and milk in our cupcakes. Being a mom of a two and four year old - we love cupcakes, and this book makes making them soooo much fun, and positively delicious! Great photos and layout to boot!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|[[ASIN:B000MRAAJM Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray]]]  Really good! Really Peacefull. Dont need anything else to chill.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I couldnt wait to have this cd, I've been a big fan of Madonna since always, but this is so damn boring...I play it many times but just get tired of. I always knew she doesnt have a good voice, but she always had manage to place great hits, this album  lyrics are so nonsense and poor, the music kind of irritated me...Madonna has a huge fan base and i feel this is a huge rip off cause she knows she can sell it even is a very low quality product. Hope she does something good as the old times again soon, thinking to please her fans, not only her pocket.  I wish she could read this and do better next time.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|As an avid period drama viewer and having seen the 1995 version I am very happy with this adaptation. It was well done with the time restraints and very much possessed the romantic tension that Fredrick and Anne had. Very subtly done and developed nicely. The main characters are much lovelier than the 1995 version and Rupert Penry Jones is a dashing Fredrick. Overall I enjoyed this very much and is a treasure in my collection.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Wow - wish I'd never seen the theatrical version now!  Why do studios force directors to hack films to pieces to fit their idea of an ideal running time?  The theatrical version was a huge disappointment to me.  THIS version, however, wow.  It all makes sense.  The characters make sense.  The plot makes sense.  I found myself actually feeling sorry for Sibylla, which was not the case in the original.  Thank God for Director's cuts, otherwise this movie would have been lost in my collection forever.
B000000XB9|5.0|This is a great CD for capturing late 60's/early 70's memories.  CCR's lyrics and music not only speak to the mood of the times, but leave a timeless tapestry for anyone trying to understand meaningful rock music.  Highly recommended!
B0002XNQ92|4.0|Best thing to do is to have all her albums, they are all great, otherwise get this great hits, any big fan of her must have it...cant give here  5 stars cause I'm mad...when is she going to make a new album? I'm guessing it will be a triple cd album full with all megahits LOL
B0013FNC38|5.0|His best so far - in addition to the infectious melodies, listening to his lyrics gives an appreciation for how talented a songwriter he is.  Absolutely a best of 2008 album.  The more I listen the more I like it.
0783225857|5.0|This film is an excellent black and white adaptation of Harper Lee's book of the same name. The acting, particularly by Gregory Peck (and a cameo by a young Robert Duval), brings out all the pathos, bathos and grit of small town Southern life in the 1930's. The story itself is an unusual combination, narrated by Peck's film daughter (and presumably Lee herself), of a stage of the coming of age story that we are fairly familiar with and the question of race and sex in the Deep South (and not only there) with which we were (at the time of the film's debut in 1962) only vaguely familiar. That dramatic tension, muted as it was by the cinematic and social conventions of the time, nevertheless made a strong statement about the underlying tensions of this society at a time when the Southern black civil rights struggle movement was coming in focus in the national consciousness.    The name Atticus Finch (Peck's role) as the liberal (for that southern locale) lawyer committed to the rule of law had a certain currency in the 1960's as a symbol for those southern whites who saw that Jim Crow had to go. Here Finch is the appointed lawyer for a black man accused of raping a white women of low origin- the classic `white trash' depicted in many a film and novel. Finch earnestly, no, passionately in his understated manner, attempts to defend this man, a brave act in itself under the circumstances.     Needless to say an all white jury of that black man's `peers' nevertheless convicts him out of hand. In the end the black man tries to escape and is killed in the process. In an earlier scenario Finch is pressed into guard duty at the jailhouse in order to head off a posse of `white trash' elements who are bend on doing `justice' their way- hanging him from a lynching tree. On a mere false accusation of a white woman this black man is doomed whichever way he turns. Sound familiar?    The other part of the story concerns the reactions by Finch's motherless son and tomboyish daughter tothe realities of social life, Southern style. That part is in some ways, particularly when the children watch the trial from the \\"Negro\\" balcony section of the courtroom, the least successful of the film. What is entirely believable and gives some relief from the travesty that is unfolding are the pranks, pitfalls and antics of the kids. The tensions between brother and sister, the protective role of the older brother, the attempt by the sister to assert her own identity, the sense of adventure and mystery of what lies beyond the immediate household that is the hallmark of youth all get a work out here. But in the end it is the quiet dignity of solid old Atticus and the bewildered dignity of a doomed black man that hold this whole thing together. Bravo Peck. Kudos to Harper Lee.
6302799066|5.0|If you love movie classics, this is one of the best black humor movies ever made. Of course you already know this because the movie has been around since the early 60's. For the new generation of movie goers, you might like this movie, on the other hand, If you think Jackass (the movie) was the best show ever, skip Dr. Strangelove because it will be way over your head.

Including a video or two would have been nice, especially for \\"Come into my world.\\"<br /><br />I look forward to buying more of her work.
0061120081|5.0|This is a review of the movie version of this book which, except for a little confusion about who killed whom at the end (Boo or not), is fairly faithful to the spirit of the book. The main points apply here as well.      This film is an excellent black and white adaptation of Harper Lee's book of the same name. The acting, particularly by Gregory Peck (and a cameo by a young Robert Duval as Boo Radley), brings out all the pathos, bathos and grit of small town Southern life in the 1930's. The story itself is an unusual combination, narrated by Peck's film daughter (and presumably Lee herself), of a stage of the coming of age story that we are fairly familiar with and the question of race and sex in the Deep South (and not only there) with which we were (at the time of the film's debut in 1962) only vaguely familiar.

6305508550|5.0|If you have ever worked for a very large corporation, this movie will hit home. I worked for one and the similarities are so true and almost heart breaking, but in a funny way.

0066620996|5.0|This book challenges every business, school, and organization to uncover the reasons why we settle for \\"good enough\\" instead of great.  As a school administrator willing to search and push for continuous improvement, I have kept this book close by.  The author Jim Collins, with his research team uses data from successful organizations to support the belief that any organization can substantially improve its performance to the point of becoming great.  The good to great ideas presented are straightforward, conclusive with great realistic strategies, and well supported with data.  Among their findings are 1) Level 5 Leadership:  It all starts with a leader who possesses personal humility and professional will, 2) First Who...Then What:  Any organization must get the right people on the bus first before  it moves forward 3) Confront the Brutal Facts:  An organization must objectively look at the current reality through examination of the facts.  4) Hedgehog Concept:  A very simple concept that any organization must find its core, and be the best in the world around that core.  5) A Culture of Discipline:  Disciplined people and disciplined thought bring disciplined action and greater performance.  6) Technology Accelerators:  Technology can take a significant role in helping an organization transform to greatness.  I believe that any organization can make a conscious choice to follow \\"Good to Great\\" concepts and after time, see itself accomplish a breakthrough similar to what Collins illustrates with a sustainable momentum similar to a heavy flywheel.

B000K15VSA|5.0|I bought this for one version alone-- the original theatrical cut.  With that out of the way, I watched all the other versions (including the \\"final cut\\") and found them all wanting.<br /><br />Of note: The documentaries.  All of them worth multiple viewings.  And the deleted scenes are great to fill in some of the gaps and show some of the different angles that they explored before finding their groove.<br /><br />You may not need all the other bells and whistles, not to mention that this doesn't fit on ANY DVD rack, but you should, at the very least, buy the boxed set that contains all of the films (too bad the \\"work print\\" can only be found here-- not as radical a take as reported, but another interesting look).

0757302661|5.0|It's about time we started hearing more about a balanced view of the labour process.  The medical world doesn't have all the answers and too often creates problems with no consequence to themselves. There is no reason why woman have to accept the hysteria and myths the medical world has created around giving birth - we've been doing it for millions of years so our bodies are clearly capable. It's up to us to educate ourselves so that we can make well informed decisions about what's best for us and our babies.
0061245097|5.0|I was very surprised to find out this book takes place four years later after Half Way to the Grave. Somehow, I was expecting it to pick right up where the last book ended, which in a sense it did, but now Cat who is half human, half vampire has been working for the government as a special agent for quite some time.  Cat has grown up.  She is more confident in herself and leads her team with all of the training Bones instilled in her.  She is a tough leader and doesn't expect anything from her team that she herself is not prepared to carry out.  She misses Bones but knows that her leaving was in his best interest.  The book has plenty of action, great characters, and a poignant romance.  I look forward to many more in this series.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Buy this one for all your teenage daughters.  Avril Lavigne is one tough cookie and doesn't compromise her ideals/morals for anybody (at least in the songs).<br /><br />Every song is a gem.  There's not one that I find myself reaching for the \\"skip\\" button.  Heck, they could all be hit singles (I think most are).<br /><br />I'm not getting into each individual song... Just buy it.  I've been listening to it in my car for almost a month.

B0006B29Z2|5.0|This DVD has about 4 concerts on it, it has interviews and history.  It seems like they took all of the Videos and turned them into DVD's.  It lasts for about 5 hours and 15 minutes, well worth every penny of the price.

B000R9J3X4|4.0|... so I had every song on here.  I was disappointed, though, by their light coverage of \\"Bleed Like Me.\\"<br /><br />Additionally, there were far better remixes they could have chosen to showcase the broad range of alternative visions of their work.

0316113506|5.0|In the interest of full disclosure, I will admit that I am a doctoral candidate in health psychology who is studying cardiovascular exercise as a viable treatment for comorbid emotional and physical disorders...  that being said, I think that everyone should read this book.     For a long time, the general public has minimized the beneficial effects of exercise and has consistently cut physical activity from school curricula. As we become more and more inactive, and consume much more calorie-dense food, our bodies are demonstrating the effects of physiologic and psychological stress. Dr. Ratey's writing style is accessible to all, and breaks down current research into themes and results that are easily understood. It is my hope that writings such as these will revolutionize the American approach to health, which currently seems to rely on purely pharmaceutical interventions. The ideas suggested in this book really provide a strong basis for the effects of exercise that we had already suspected, and packages it in a manner that will be relevant to people in all walks of life.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm just getting started with excersize after having my 2nd baby 6 months ago. I was sore for a week after doing the beginner 20 minute workout. I think its a great video and a very intense workout. I'm happy I got it, but will work on some other videos with less intensity before making this workout routine. Great video for my collection. Wonderful workout if you only have short time intervals for working out. This video will definitely produce major results if you can stick to it.

B000YEUUCK|5.0|I am not that much of a Celine Dion fan, but I do like some of her hits.  I purchased this Blu Ray Disc so that I could demonstrate what an oustanding production looks like to those just getting into high definition.  This is what I have to say;  This is the way God would have done it if He had the money.  Even if you are not a Celine Dion fan, you would appreciate this Blu Ray disc.  This has undoubtedly the highest production values, bar none, than any other live production I have ever seen. The stage that she performs on is a state of the art, computerized marvel of a  masterpiece of science and technology. The performance itself was flawless; afterall they had four years and 700 performances to rehearse. The more I watch this disc, the more I become a Celine Dion fan.  This is the epitome of excellence in live productions.  You cannot go wrong with this one and its well worth the money, and you'll  want to watch it again and again.  On the negative side, this has nothing to do with the contents of the disc, but the disc itself.  I use a high end computer to play back my discs, either Blu Ray or HD with an LG Super Multi drive and Win DVD 9 and Power DVD Ultra software.  I had some issues of erratic playback with Win DVD 9, the latest version, but none with the Power DVD Ultra.  Dan Casey

B000WO251Q|5.0|One would think that the Army, the War and lovelorn feelings are quite cliche - Nicholas sparks again hits the nail right on with the hammer. I was gripped by the prologue in the store, and bought it simply because \\"Three Weeks with my Brother\\" was unavailable. When I began reading, I couldn't stop. I was up in the late hours of night finishing every last word of this novel.  I read it in one sitting...just over four hours curled up - engrossed in the story.  I cried, I laughed and I was angry. I felt sentiment and understanding just as the characters do for each other. Absolutely read this novel. It's filled with understanding and sacrifice and things that we wish we could be.
B00168HARG|5.0|Terminator: The Sara Connor Chronicles Season One has not been released yet on Blu Ray, but I have pre-ordered and anxiously await for its arrival.  However, I have downloaded the entire season from Unbox and the quality isn't bad at all, but rather good in fact, but not quite as good as the 720p hd version broadcast on Fox. I can't wait for the 1080p version on Blu Ray. I have already written one review about this series   for the Unbox download and mentioned then that I think the producers have done rather well considering that they did not have the budget to work with their big brothers' of the big screen had. I am one of those few,I suppose that didn't particularly care for T3. There was nothing technically wrong with it, but I didn't like the ending at all.  The T3 ending sort of messed things up as far as the timeline coda was concerned which took the saga into a different direction than the television series. I think the producers were wanting to get another crack at Arnold before he ran for Governor of California, and they simply wanted to just get another script out there. That's okay though, because if you look at Superman, it has several different spin offs as well as the original theme; ie \\"Smallville\\" and \\"Lois and Clark.\\" In T3, Sarah Connor alledgedly died from cancer. The writers of the tv series explained that away as mentioning that when Sarah, John, and Cameron time travelled eight years into the future, they by-passed Sarah's death. Okay, that makes sense to me, I guess. In doing stories about time travel, you have the flexibility to explore different timelines and this technique will probably be used here; an indication of that has already been shown introducing Derrick Reese, Kyle Reese's brother. The bottom line is, I don't think the real Terminator fans are going to care that much, because it's all just pure fantasy anyway and great entertainment fare.  Dan Casey
B000B5XOSO|5.0|I always thought the Batman Returns was a great sequel to Batman. The story was an insteresting one and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave great performances. Plus lets face it, Tim Burton  was a geniuses and did the comic book character more justice than Joel Screwmacher ever did.<br /><br />Plot: Oswald Cobblepot also know as The Penguin(played By Danny Devito) is abandoned by his parents as child for being deformed. He uses this as an excuse to masquerade a sinister plot to abduct the first born children of Gotham with the help of his goons(Red Triangle Gang) and a very shady tycoon Max Shreck(played by Christopher Walken). Max Shreck later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle(Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by Max Shreck and is revived by cats. Later on she develops cat-like qualities and seeks to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. Her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained.<br /><br />Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic. It has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere. Tim Burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing. Micheal Keaton is still sharp as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot/The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have made a better Violator for the movie Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever could. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. Unfortunately, the Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton decided to do no more. You'll never see a Batman movie like this again. You dont believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin.
0765348276|5.0|Found this book to be hard to put down.  I've just started reading books again after a long time of not reading anything but news on the net.  As they say this does resemble Star Ship Troopers.  As I'm pushing middle age I can see why the main charictor would desire to take on the new adventure.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book.  5 stars all the way.
1400063515|1.0|Kudos to the folks who rated this literary garbage \\"one star\\".  Taleb is an arrogant, intellectual bully who contradicts himself several times in an disconnected diatribe that could've been shortened by at least 300 pages.  Talk about needing an editor.

B0016CQCMQ|5.0|Best album of 2008.  Great both musically and lyrically.  Some of the best alternative rock ever.
B000I0QL82|5.0|\\"Holiday Inn\\", a charming Paramount musical released in 1942, has been given solid gold treatment in this superb anniversary edition.  The merits of the film are well known: the great Irving Berlin score featuring the ever popular \\"White Christmas\\"; Fred Astaire, charming and ebullient, with a matchless fire cracker number; Bing Crosby, always galvanised into a better performer when paired with a peerless co-star; 2 easy going leading ladies and excellent production values. Particular highlights for me are the bright song and dance for Astaire and Virginia Dale to \\"Easy to Dance with\\" and the romantic \\"Be Careful, It's my heart\\"    What makes this DVD so special though are that the print is perfect and the extras are lush:  - a featurette about the advent of song and dance with the coming of talkies and how the technicians constructed and polished the performances.  - a featurette about the careers of Astaire and Crosby and their interaction over many years. Astaire's charming daughter Ava appears with some delightful personal anecdotes about her father.   - a comprehensive commentary delivered in an easygoing low key style and chock full of information about the making of the film as well as interpolations from Astaire and Crosby themselves.   - the orginal trailer, production notes and profiles of those who made the film.    This is one of the most lovingly produced DVD editions of all. Even the menu selection is special with cuts from the film and moving scene selections.  The package is outstanding value.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This video is a MUST HAVE for every Celtic Woman fan!  The setting and the music are both perfect!  These women know how to sing and their voices are so clear and crisp that they just sparkle!  This is a video that you will watch time and time again.  The only thing better than this video of Celtic Woman is to see them in a LIVE performance, which my wife and I did from the 2nd row!  The DVD is also full of \\"extras\\" that are so informative, such as interviews with the ladies and the making of the video.  These extras really help you get to know the talents that make up Celtic Woman both on stage and behind the scenes.  BUY IT, you'll LIKE IT!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Whether a beginner, or advanced fitness buff, you are sure to enjoy this workout. Gillian has two trainers behind her...while they are both doing the same workout, the more advanced trainer does it at a higher intensity. If you've been working out already and are in great shape, follow her...and it's an easy workout, no coordination needed...but you'll see great results. Less experienced or no experience? Do the same workout with the \\"beginner\\" trainer.<br />Jillian leads both.<br />The workout is fast-paced but packed so you get maximum intensity in a smaller amount of time. Yes, you'll feel it...but it's simple to do and her constant motivation and \\"trainer talk\\" is truly like having a super trainer you'd pay hundreds of dollars an hour for...motivating you in your own home.<br />My better half and I, both of varying levels of fitness, both LOVE this cd and are seeing superb results in little time. Because I have a heart rate monitor I can report I get a better workout with this cd than on my $2,000 elliptical machine...and a better workout than at Curves with faster results as well as far as the definition I've built.<br /><br />I've had a personal trainer before...but had nowhere near these results...its the motivation and the combination of moves combined with a true professional and extremely GOOD trainer showing you how and keeping you going. In fact, that's why I'm back on Amazon...to see what other cds she has. It's really improved our workout routine yet it doesn't FEEL hard when doing it...(although my heart rate goes up HIGH and I have great caloric burn)<br /><br />the next day you FEEL your muscle building...the soreness...and THAT muscle building is what keeps burning the calories and increases your metabolism while you lose inches.<br /><br />love it!<br /><br />p.s. the first time you do it...it may feel tough...hang in there, it gets easier each time then you can move up to the next level as your body gains strength and you get smaller!
B0018NIQA4|5.0|I have been listening to this CD all day long, me and my co workers are really feeling it.  Must have.      Derrick Dunn \\"DJ Aftermarh\\" gives a great review of this CD.    \\"After a four year hiatus, Usher returns with one of the best mainstream R&B CD's of the year. Just as Usher as grown and changed as a man so has his music, which is a great thing in my opinion. Stand out tracks on the CD for me were Love You Gently,Something Special, Prayer For You and the title track. The not so great one for me is Moving Mountians which is one of the worst songs he's ever recorded. My detatiled review can be found below.     1. Intro - This is a basic Usher intro where he sets up the vibe of the album.   2. Love In This Club featuring Young Jeezy - Unless you've been living under a rock you've heard this song.   3. This Ain't Sex - Another one of my personal favorite tracks. Even though it's a throwback to his My Way days, it has a Michael Jackson Rock With You type feel as it's just a feel good track about dancing.   4. Trading Places - (written by The- Dream and produced by Tricky Stewart): A hot slow jam similar to Can You Handle It. This is one of personal favorite tracks as it shows Usher's fully matured tenor.   5. Moving Mountains - The second single still confuses me every time I hear it. The Dream gives me his first disappointment as a writer and Tricky Stewart gives us a mediocre beat. I think this is one of the worst songs Usher has ever recorded.   6. What's Your Name featuring will.i.am - This is an ok track, however it sounds better suited for Craig David. Will I Am gives a catchy beat as always but the vocals aren't really special.   7. Prayer For You Interlude - With the impending birth of my own son, I can really identify with Usher and there's nothing stronger than the bond between a father and son.   8. Something Special - This song reminds of walking in the park with my wife and making our way to a picnic. It has a laid back summer feel to it and reminds ofa seventies Stevie Wonder.   9. Love You Gently - Now this is the Usher I like to hear. Love You Gently is easily on par with Nice & Slow, Twork It Out and Can U Handle It as Usher's throwback to Bobby Brown's Roni & Rock Witcha. I can easily see this being his \\"concert song\\" when he tours.   10. Best Thing featuring Jay Z - Nothing too special a standard my girl left me track and I want her back. Usher doesn't over sing on this track or under sing and I highly doubt it'll be a single even with the stamp of the Jigga man. It doesn't really go with the Vibe of the new CD and would have fared better on his previous CD.   11. Before I Met You - This is an ok song, nothing to special and Usher kind of under sings it. Basically he's talking about how his life has changed since he met his current girlfriend and he refuses to go back to his old ways.   12. His Mistakes a.k.a. I Can't Win- (Produced by Stargate & written by Ne-Yo) - This can basically be described as Can't Help But Wait Part 2. Usher's strong vocals make the song work; however with the riffs being similar to the Trey Songz hit it's nothing really impressive.   13. Appetite - Appetite is kind if the red headed step child to Before I Met You. Even though he's a happily married man and in love he's still a man who loves the ladies.   14. What's A Man To Do - This song has some truth to it and Usher's vocals make it work since the beat isn't to promising. Usher is one of the few singers who can sing anything and he'll sound good as he does with this song. This is another song that would have gone better on the Confessions CD.   15. Lifetime - Usher's little brother J-Lack continues to show he's a wonder kid when it comes to making beats and this is a nice mid tempo ballad.   16. Love In This Club Part II featuring Beyoncé & Lil Wayne - A great remix tops the original and Love In The Part II does just that. Truth be told Usher should have released this version as the lead single instead.   17. Here I Stand - Just like Can U Help Me, Separated and Burn before it, Here I Stand is Usher's big ballad on the CD. Here I Stand may upset some female fans as it's a testament to his love for his wife but it's one of my favorite songs on the CD and Usher has never sounded so strong vocally.   18. Will Work For Love (Produced by J.R.Rotem) - Usher easily sings this feel good track and while the chorus can get annoying this songs seems better suited for Akon.   Usher recorded upwards of sixty songs for the CD and some of the tracks such as The Realest feat. Jermaine Dupri, Lights Camera Action feat. Nelly, and At The Time featuring T-Pain were cut and remain unheard. However the tracks mentioned below can be found on the web, import versions of the CD and mixtaspes.     CUT TRACKS & Bonus Tracks   Flash - (Produced by The Neptune's) - A horrid sounding track from the once reliable Neptune's which didn't make the album. The Neptune's and Usher had amazing chemistry on his 8701 CD, however they strike out this time.   Echo -This is one of the best tracks from Bryan Michael Cox that was cut. The song reminds me of Alexander O Neal's Hearsay.     Play Me - (Produced by the Avilla Brothers) - This is a winner that won't be on the initial release of the album, however it's rumored to be on the re-release. The Avilla Brothers who produced That's What's It Made For, from the Confessions CD, give Usher another winner in this track. I don't know how it would fare in the states but in the UK (where I used to DJ) I could easily see the Brits liking this track with its techno driven beat.     Dat Girl Right There - (produced by Rich Harrison) - The third time isn't the charm for Luda and Usher on this track. This song seems better suited for Day26 or Omarion as Usher vocals are to strong for this track and Luda's verse is second rate at best. The beat from Rich Harrison is also a huge disappointment as he's known for Go Go styled drum beats.     Just Like Me - Another song that doesn't really go with the grown man vibe Usher was going for on This CD. It's basically talking about how Usher and his girl are both doing dirt and I'm happy it didn't make the final cut.     Forever Young - This is a longer version of the intro.     Revolver - No thoughts really on this song it's just another song.     All in all a fine album and this is easily one of the best mainstream R&B albums along with Mariah Carey's E=MC2 to be released in 2008. Usher has once again claimed his throne as one of the kings of modern R&B and shows he's not ready to give up the throne yet.\\"

0670018651|5.0|Luca Turin and his Wife Tania Sanchez do an excellent job of letting the  reader know what they like or dislike about 1500 fragrances. Use it as a guide to acquire some samples for testing yourself. I discovered a couple that I would have never even tried on my own searching. That was worth the price of the book alone. Beyond Paradise Men by Estee Lauder and Yohji Homme  were the two great discoveries for me . Now go buy a copy and discover some treasures for yourself. If you need some samples of some of the more esoteric frags go to [...] - they have most everything.    My only bitch about the book is they don't rate the fragrances with sillage and longevity ratings. Longevity is important to me because I have dry skin and live in the desert. Alot of scents just don't last unless they have major sillage and longevity. A very important factor for perfume enthusiasts that didn't get addressed.

B0013FXWU6|2.0|Daniel Day Lewis is incredible even though I found myself thinking about that character he played in GANGS of NEW YORK at times and I absolutely love Paul Thomas Anderson films. That said, I could not get through this film, the score was dreadful, the pacing montonous, it was all so heavy-handed and melodramatic. My wife made it through about and hour of the film and I tried again after she went to bed. Alas, it was not to be.
140120306X|1.0|Although the other negative reviews capture the problems with this book, I wanted to add my voice to the chorus and attempt to save someone some money.      If you are a fan of the rest of the series, do not buy this book.  I agree with the comments that it was \\"self-indulgent\\" and a \\"mess.\\"  It is a ridiculous addition to the series, which perhaps should be sub-titled: \\"A paycheck for nothing.\\"  I truly wonder if this book was the result of a contract dispute between Alan Moore and the publishing company.      The end of the book is indeed incomprehensible, and if there is meaning in it, beyond a slapdash nod to the abundance of human imagination, which feels forced and contrived, it is beyond me.  I believe that Alan Moore is a genius, due to his work in Watchmen, but this was a disappointment that dips as low as that work reaches high. Atrocious.     I will be selling my copy, for whatever I can get for it, and thereafter, pretending it was not written.
B00005JPNZ|2.0|Leave it to George Lucas to ruin another franchise. This lousy mish-mash of a film stinks of his tone-deaf storytelling, although he surely isn't alone shouldering the blame. Spielberg, after all, let him get away with it, and David Koepp (an otherwise decent screenwriter) gets credit for taking Lucas' \\"story\\" and trying to make sense out of it. Much like Episodes I through III tarnished the three original Star Wars films, this sad, overly long exercise makes the original Indy films feel like Oscar contenders.

0060557818|5.0|It's a novel about an ordinary guy trying do his best with an ordinary life but he wants more out of it even though he himself doesn't know it yet.  He helps a girl who comes to his apartment in the dead of night even though he knows that he probably shouldn't get involved.      Then strange things start to happen as he loses his touch with \\"reality\\" a new London that he did not know exist is opened up to him.  Normally this would make for a very boring book but it just so happens that the girl he rescued is the last of a family of Guardians and not only does he have to enlist aid for her they also have to dodge the efforts of two great comical villains.      Overall-The plot would be nothing special except for the ability of  Neil Gaiman to really describe it to us and give it a life of it's own everyone has a unique voice from Richard Mayhew to the Ratspeaker and as always my poor efforts at a review cannot really describe how great this book is.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I had viewed this game on Amazon, and found it intriguing. With a birthday soon I asked for this. Today, I got it, played it, and its one that will be coming out, many times.<br />The simplistic rules, very sturdy board, and vibrant colors are all well liked, and welcomed. For an individual with multiple medical problems, greatly effecting my mobility makes it hard to find things I can do.<br />The pieces are of good size, and fit fairly easily on the board. This is a big plus, many games with a playing table you have to click it into place, not here!<br />Instructions are colored, and easy to understand text. They show the correct, and non correct ways to place your bricks. The insert, and back of the box has this information. The one fault, if visually impaired, someone with better sight will need to read the rules, and how to play!
B00003CWN3|2.0|I think Hilary Swank did an excellent job with this role.  But, in my opinion, the movie seemed to be thrown together.  I had heard it was a good movie and it got a B, but it didn't make a whole lot of sense.  Perhaps if didn't feel so rushed, it would have been better.
B00000F214|4.0|What can you say about the Usual Suspects that hasn't already been said by a hundred other reviewers. It's a great movie and if you haven't seen it then you must buy a copy right away. It is a must see film. Why not rent it you ask? Because this is a movie that you will want to see over and over again. It's one of those films that gets lodged in your unconscious and never quite goes away. You have to watch it at least twice to really appreciate it. I was impressed by the bluray transfer of this film. It really has never looked or sounded better. I am however quite disappointed with the lack of extras. If you are expecting extras for the film sadly this one has none. If you are a fan buy it. If you are new to this film buy two. One for you and one for your best friend.
B000W8OM5Y|4.0|If you take this film as fiction (forgetting its glaring historical accuracies that have been pointed out by many reviewers here), it's very entertaining, filled with massive, epic, breathtaking battle scenes.  I really liked the film when I saw it in a theater, and considering it was only Gibson's 2nd directorial effort (for which he won an Oscar), it's quite a remarkable achievement.<br /><br />Many now make hay of the incredible violence here.  It is violent, gory, insane, bloody, etc., etc..  When I saw the film, I thought it was necessary to tell the story and very well done.  I think many here don't like the violence of this film because of Gibson's questionable behaviours since making this film.  His extreme religious beliefs turn off many people.  His personal behaviour (his rabid anti-Semitism, his sexist comments on women, his alcoholism) is horrible.  Yet, this is still a good film, I think.  I haven't watched it in years, but I enjoyed it very much when it was made.  It is a bit difficult to look at Gibson the same way as I did when this film was made because of his questionable behaviours, but he's still an excellent filmmaker.  All four films he's directed (including The Passion of the Christ, which I recently viewed again and liked it very much the 2nd time around) are very memorable.<br /><br />The film itself is a rather cardboard cutout film, ignoring the complexity of Scottish independence, reducing the story to a simplistic plotline of William Wallace's true love is killed, he gets pissed, helps Scotland become free.  The portrayal of Edward Longshanks (by Patrick McGoohan, of TV's The Prisoner) is good, but Gibson indulges his silly homophobia in the portrayal of Longshanks's son, who would become Edward II, a gay king.  Edward II is portrayed as an effeminate wimp, but in reality, the real Edward II was much more dynamic.  See Derek Jarman's Edward II film for a much more realistic portrayal of this complex historical figure.<br /><br />Overall, the film is still entertaining and rousing.  The battle scenes are especially well done, and if you can ignore the dubious history of both the film and Mel's \\"issues\\", you can still enjoy it.entertaining and rousing.

B0012GVKW8|3.0|Look there goes Arnold running through the jungle shooting large guns and keeping his dialogue to a minimum. His friends are doing the same thing only they are getting killed. If you like movies that have high popcorn value then you should buy this Bluray disc. It is the best transfer so far of this movie available in any video format. If you have seen the DVD versions of this movie you will know what I'm talking about. They are all washed out and super murky. There are still some problems with this transfer of course- it is anything but perfect but it still looks pretty good for an action film from the 80's. If you want this movie for special effects or to show off your great bluray system this isn't the disc for you. However if you just want to watch a decent scifi movie filled with blood and frantic alien chase scenes then break out the popcorn- send the kids to bed and prepare to watch some mindless action and 80's style jungle warfare violence.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|A new release of The Breakfast Club is coming out in September with an audio commentary by Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall, a couple features called \\"Sincerely Yours\\" and \\"Most Convenient Definitions: The Origins of the Brat Pack,\\" and the theatrical trailer.  These will be the first real special features to have been included with The Breakfast Club on DVD.  It's known that there are deleted scenes (some have been shown on TV), but there was no mention of any in the announcement for the new DVD.<br /><br />The Breakfast Club is considered by many the quintessential high school movie, which is quite a comment on high school, as almost the entire film takes place in detention.  Five students, each representing a type but fleshed out into real characters as the film develops, are stuck together on a Saturday in detention.  In terms they use themselves, there's a \\"criminal\\" (Judd Nelson), a \\"princess\\" (Molly Ringwald), a \\"jock\\" (Emilio Estevez), a \\"brain\\" (Anthony Michael Hall), and a \\"basket case\\" (Ally Sheedy).  Effectively portrayed tension between the five builds to explosive levels before they finally discover how much they have in common.  There is a lot of sharp humor, some hijinks, a lot of emotional release in the last third.  The acting is very good.  Nelson is especially good as the main catalyst for the tension, projecting a powerful personality and sharp mind turned in against self and back out at others.<br /><br />I loved this movie in the '80s.  I still like it and admire it now, though its formula seems a little more prominent to me than it used to.  By today's standards it may seem to pull its punches when it comes to the reasons kids have to be unhappy and in trouble, but it strikes a fair balance between entertaining teen comedy and realism.  It's also a fine time capsule from the '80s.<br /><br />The new DVD will be 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with English Dolby Digital 5.1 and English DTS 5.1.  No indication has been given that this will be any different from the older DVDs.<br /><br />New Flashback Editions of two other John Hughes classics, Sixteen Candles and Weird Science, are slated to come out on the same day as this one.  Each will include a feature about the film.  Weird Science will also have the Weird Science TV series pilot episode and the theatrical trailer.  Apparently only this one gets an audio commentary.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I purchased this product (AKG K240) on Amazon for $114 and for the price it's nearly unbeatable. I think it has a very wide, spatial sound stage and I particularly notice the placement of the sound is just were I like it. Every channel of music is separate and distinct. The mids are not as warm as the Sennheiser HD555s I own, but the placement of the sound is much better in my opinion. It's also easier to get a bass response out of these phones with the help of a good headphone amp, since my iaudio U3 is the only mp3 player I own that can drive them low without help (I have other mp3 players that such much better though).<br /><br />The HD555s on the other hand need very strong amplification to even notice much of a low end bass. With proper source amplification though, the K240s are very engaging, fun and offer a wide sound stage and are really good at separating instruments, drums & vocals in any genre of music. They are also very lightweight and you almost forget they're on after a few minutes.<br /><br />They have only a slightly artificial, tinny treble at high frequencies especially when compared to the HD555, but other than that, I think they are better phones for the money. I only wish they were slightly easier to drive at lower volumes.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I love this CD from start to finish. There are a few tracks that I could do without but overall I really enjoy all of the songs. It's a fresh, new sound for Madonna while it still generates some of the classic techno that we hear in many of her songs. I was very impressed. I've never been a huge Madonna fan but after I heard \\"4 Minutes\\" and I heard of all the producers she worked with on this album, I decided that I would buy it. I'm so glad I did.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums that Britney Speras has done. It's very catchy and the beats are good. I wish she had put some ballads on the cd. I have loved all of Britney's ballads in the past even though there haven't been that many. I think this album is all about having fun and not letting what others think get to you as she decribes in \\"Piece of Me\\". But like all albums this album has some of those songs that shouldn't have even been put on the cd. I believe the songs that shouldn't have made the cut are: Freakshow, Toy Soldier, and Heaven on Earth. I really hope that her future albums will include better vocals and those same catchy songs that get stuck in everyone's heads. I really enjoyed this album.
B000V78URW|5.0|This book is the most insightful I've read thus far in terms of explaining the current phenomenon in Iraq - a perpetual state of war, with all of the accoutrements; no burdensome regulations, oversight, or accountability - just a wild-west of profiteering.    When coupled with her accounts of the South American / Central American projects, along with the U.S response to hurricane Katrina, it's obvious indeed where we are headed.    What's sad is that many of the GOP lemmings will never see this - as George Lakoff wrote in his excellent book \\"Don't Think of an Elephant\\", \\"the facts will simply bounce right off of them.\\"    Well done, Ms. Klein.

B000MGUZM0|4.0|*Review from a Classic Rock fan<br />I really felt that this album is much more diverse than Funeral. Whereas Funeral seemed to have an overall sound to it, this album makes it all much more interesting, adding a lot of organ and orchestral pieces. It starts and ends wonderfully, with \\"Black Mirror\\" in the beginning setting the stage for what is to come, and ending with \\"No Cars Go\\" (featured in Top Gear) and \\"My Body Is A Cage,\\" which I loved and is my favorite song off the album. The structure of this song alone makes it great, but it is so much more than that, just like with the rest of the album.

B0002IVN9W|3.0|*Review From A Classic Rock Fan<br />I found this album to be very repetitive. Maybe not in the song structures or lyrics, but in the sound. I have listened to this five times now and I still have not found an amazing song that really sticks out among the rest. The upside to this however is that there is not a bad note, making this album just OK. It is the album's sound that has probably made it so popular, because then there is not much room for criticism. However, that is why I like there next album so much more, because it is so much more diverse, and something that I would recommend well before this one.

B00005JMX6|5.0|Risky Business II?  Sure, it's a typical attempt to remake Risky Business, with a young, charismatic young man getting involved with a beautiful, mysterious young woman; however, there are enough twists and turns to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is the typical over-achiever in high school.  He's in all sorts of clubs, AP classes, and never seems to have the care-free fun that the rest of his fellow seniors are having.  He's even gone so far as to start a fund to bring a Cambodian, teenage genius to America.  His whole world changes when Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in next door.<br /><br />In a matter of no time it becomes clear that Danielle is a former porn star - discovered by Matthew's porn-obsessed friend Eli (Chris Marquette) - and she has a world of experience and knowledge that are going to broaden Matthew's horizons on more than one level.<br /><br />Danielle wants out of the porn business, but her sleazy producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) wants the exact opposite.  It's soon a battle of influence, as Matthew tugs at Danielle's heart-strings, while Kelly tugs at her through the type of power typically given to those who would dominate over another psychologically.  It's only when Kelly gets involved that the predictability disappears.  Each and every scene with Kelly is a scene stealer and an adventure.  Whereas we all pretty much know what's going to happen in most teen comedy movies, The Girl Next Door gives a fresh take on the genre.<br /><br />The climax at the prom (pun intended) was a brilliant way to conclude the movie, squeeze a few gorgeous women into the movie (Sung Hi Lee cameo), and provide a combination of comedy and real drama.<br /><br />It would be a travesty if I didn't mention the fact that the \\"Eli Experience\\", the eventual producing empire formed by Eli as part of a whirlwind surprise ending, is clearly my favorite part of the movie.  His persona and control of the AV dork \\"minion\\", his ability to run with a brilliant idea, his response to learning about Danielle's past, his actions during a porn expo, and his abrupt response to a smarmy question provided tons of laughs throughout.learning about Danielle's past, his actions during a porn expo, and his abrupt response to a smarmy question provided tons of laughs throughout.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|I must say when I first saw this package upon release I was put off by the high price. But I kept an eye on it and this can now be found for up to 75% off list. I suddenly became very interested and just had to order it. Am I ever glad I did. The first thing you notice is the sheer quality of the picture in hi-def. Now some have complained that the picture it too clear and the plywood sets lose their credibility. I have not noticed this by any stretch. What I am struck with however is how well the performances have held up some 40+ years later. Right from the initial episode the chemistry among cast/characters was fleshed out. To think this originally aired in 1966! Unbelievable. The reworked special effects only serve to enhance the experience. Like the current team explains on the special features segment, they wanted to do something the originators would have done if the technology was available at that time. They made NO attempt to bring the special effects up to current standards. Smart choice as it would have been distracting. My only regret is Season Two is currently not on the Blu-Ray release schedule as the HD-DVD format has been abandoned. I'm sure, in time, this will be released on Blu-Ray and all will be right again with the initial hi-def release strategy. In the meantime I will enjoy Season One in all its hi-def glory.

0375842209|5.0|This is one of the most remarkable and haunting books I have ever read.  At times I couldn't put it down and other times I had to put it down.  The book takes place during WW II in Hitler's Germany but it is so much more than a war novel.  The characters are fascinating and usually very developed.   The narator of the book is \\"Death\\" yet it isn't a horror story in the traditional sense.  Anyone who loves historical novels that make you think about the human condition will want to read this book.  It is suggested as a book for teenagers, and is appropriate for mature teenagers, but adults will want to read it as well.

From reading the Motley Crue book I knew there was a lot of craziness going on in Nikki Sixx's life but had no clue how deep it ran.

B00127R7JM|5.0|I don't think it would be correct to consider Ihsahn's second album angL an improvement to his first solo effort The Adversary. While this album progresses and goes new places, mainly darker and more sinister places, the genius is so clearly present on his previous work that it would be unfair and frankly lazy to say that angL is \\"better\\" than The Adversary; it's different certainly, but also no less brilliant.    I don't see the need to rehash what I assume everyone already knows about Ihsahn's solo efforts. Needless to say, therefore, if you loved the first one, you'll love this one, and for many of the same reasons. But there are a few new (though related) reasons to love angL, and those are the ones I will highlight. With very limited exception, Ihsahn's focus hasn't been on aggression since his work with Emperor. Not since \\"Curse You All Men\\" has he put this much fury into his music, without any loss to its beauty. This emphasis on aggression also lets Ihsahn show off his chops: black and thrash riffs abound on this work - all tastefully done, of course.  Then there's \\"Unhealer,\\" which is a reason in itself: awesome. But that pretty much goes for the whole album. Honestly, if you don't like this album, there may just be something wrong with you. (Of course, if you've ever written a review in all caps, then there definitely something wrong with you. Just thought I'd let you know.)

0765348276|5.0|Old Man's War is sci-fi as it's meant to be and Scalzi may be one of the best modern science fictions authors I've read.  As the critic praise has commented already, this book reads like Heinlein come again.      John Scalzi's writing style hooked me immidiately.  I began empathizing with his main character, John Perry, almost instantly.  He writes John (from the first person) in a way that expresses his emotion as well as his sarcasm, making him a very entertaining character.  By the time John enlists and joins up in the Colonial Defence Force, he meets other sarcastic characters like himself and the dialogue between them had be laughing out loud on numerous occasions.      In Scalzi's universe, no one can join the CDF until they are 75, as they want experienced and knowlegable human beings rather than young and immature ones.  The book follows John and his band of self-designated \\"Old Farts\\" as they go to space for the first time, learn how they're going to be made young and battle-ready, head to combat training and then off to war with the numerous alien races who want to halt mankind's expansion into space.  Every one of these aspects is very well written and very entertaining.  The action scenes are fast-paced and intense and the scientific implications such as the Skip Drive are fascinating.    For me this book invoked nearly every emotion, from laughter to excitement to sadness.  There may have been a couple of parts that I found a little hard to swallow (actually, the inch-tall alien race is the only one I can think of), but nothing worth dwelling over.  If you liked Heinlien's Starship Troopers, you may like this even more.  All respect to the classic sci-fi writer, but this book is more entertaining in almost every way.  Read it and enjoy.  I'm on to read Ghost Brigades.

B000YMBBH0|4.0|This series is a fantastic story of the life (and pre-life) of our antagonist, Jason Bourne. While the action is top notch, and the acting superb, i would have liked to see LESS camera jitter. It's simply all over the place. The series on HD definetely looks good, though would have been crisper if it wasn't shot like it was. I understand it was done that way to, you know, intesify thing. it's just my personal opinion that the actual picture quality does suffer for that. I digress....the actual movies are awesome. buy them if you like action, and suspense and james bond-esque themed movies.     online content suffers as well, as you must create an account for the third installment's features, which takes exessive time. i had to give up after half an hour, and just watch the movie again. still, totally worth it.
0743219619|4.0|The gloomy tone that pervades this novel which seemed to turn a lot of people off was actually what I found interesting. The Inspector, recovering from an illness goes to visit an elderly priest who is a family friend at a home for people with degenerative diseases. When he arrives he's informed that the priest has died, but Dalgliesh begins to wonder if it was natural or murder. My only complaint with the story was partially to blame on my own attention span: Many of the suspects began to bleed together, and my inability to consume long passages at once left me looking back to keep the characters straight in my head. As a result I didn't find the book as absorbing as some of her others. Yet at the same time, the final forty pages was some of the most suspenseful of anything I've read thus far, and Dalgliesh's personal struggles throughout the book gave a human dimension to the character that up to now hadn't been seen.
055358894X|5.0|The debut novel from Scott Lynch, The Lies of Locke Lamora is an incredibly fun story that mixes all of the excitement and joy of Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser and Ocean's Eleven to create an imaginative tale that I found to hard to put down.  The prose is fresh and rich in description, the dialogue is witty and foul-mouthed, and the plot is a delightfully Byzantine labyrinth of complex cons, double and triple crosses, sinister assassinations, alchemy, black magic, and the bonds of friendship in the face of overwhelming odds.    The story takes place in Camorr, a vaguely Venetian city built by a mysterious race known as the Eldren, who fled their empire thousands of years ago for unknown reasons.  Mankind has since taken up residence in Camorr as long term squatters and gotten along just fine in the eerily beautiful city.  It's here that Locke Lamora and his brotherly band of Gentleman Bastards relieve the nobility of their hefty purses, always with a smile and an expertly executed con.      Locke and his crew are just beginning such a scam when they become involved, much against their will, in a plot by the elusive Gray King, scourge of the underworld, to overthrow Camorr's Godfather of crime.    And that's when things REALLY get interesting.    I can't stress enough how much fun I had reading this book.  Lynch delivers an engaging plot that continuously raises the stakes and makes you want to turn the page and find out what happens next, all the while keeping you emotionally attached to his merry band of thieves.  Additionally, he does an amazing job fleshing out Camorr itself, delving into its culture, crime, religion, and daily life in a way that makes it every bit as important a character in the story as Locke.  However, I will admit there were times I parsed my way through those descriptions of the city to get back to the plot.  These moments were few and far between though, and rarely distracted me from the plot.    The Lies of Locke Lamora is a great piece of fantasy that should not be missed by anybody.  In a genre that has been choking on Too Much Of The Same Thing for years now, Lynch succeeds in putting a new spin on classic ideas, and the result is an entertaining narrative that will leave you wondering why there aren't more books like this out there.
0575077174|5.0|Reynolds is a master of \\"BIG CONCEPT\\" Science Fiction. I have read everything available that this man has written.  The idea of humans living for six million years is a bit hard to swallow, (I am not a big fan of Posthuman stories) but he pulls it off well.

B000P12LWY|5.0|I only started watching the Tudors in the Second Season and I fell in love with it so I ordered the 1st Season to watch it.  It was much better than expected.  I had planned to watch only one episode per day but I was on the edge of my seat so I watched the entire season in one day.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I have yet to read the book, but for a long time I'd thought of seeing this movie, the cover with the sunflowers and the cloudy lenses of Elijah Wood catching my eyes (I'm a sucker for sunflowers, what can I say?). Then discovering Eugene Hutz, lead singer of Gogol Bordello (a group which I am totally obsessed with), was in the movie, helped get me to the video store to finally check it out. And I'm glad I did, because I fell in love with this wonderful, quirky, thoughtful, hilarious, melancholy film.  Wood plays Jonathan Safran Foer, who goes to Ukraine in search of his roots after his grandmother dies, and he is given a photo of his grandfather with a woman in a field taken during World War II (his family is Jewish). Jonathan has a curious collector's habit of stashing souvenirs (retainers, used condoms, false teeth, jewelry, etc.) in plastic baggies and displaying the collection on the walls of his home. So he heads to Ukraine, and there meets up with his tour guide and translator, played by Stephen Samudovsky and Hutz.   Their road trip begins, and the first part is hilarious with the cultural differences emerging (the Ukrainian grandfather and grandson can't figure out why Jonathan would be a vegetarian and figure he must be crazy), and Hutz's Alex is a scene-stealer with his thesaurus-gleaned English (\\"I am a premisum dancer!\\" \\"Women want to be carnal with me because I am such a premium dancer!\\")   It's very funny and amusing and then things grow more dark and  serious as the truth comes out Jonathan's family's past, and Alex finds out some surprising truths about his country's history as well as his family's.   On top of that, the scenery is beautiful (that field of sunflowers!) and the music is wonderful, Eastern European music.   Samudovsky is fanatastic as the cranky, cantankerous and haunted grandfather.   Liev Schrieber put together a wonderful road trip film, now a part of my DVD collection so I can watch any time I wish. Premium!

0452289963|1.0|Of all the books I have read and reviewed, this book is by far my biggest disappointment. I was impressed by all the hype this book had received and was looking forward to reading it. Unfortunately, after just a few pages, I knew I was in for a long read.    I found Tolle to be arrogant, redundant, condescending, and very hard to read and understand. When he was not completely losing me in the vast majority of his verbose and overly-philosophical passages, he took a very obtuse and indirect approach to say many of the same things that others like Viktor Frankl, Stephen Covey, Rick Warren, and Stoic philosophers like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius have said very clearly and directly.    While the book does discuss some important spiritual and philosophical perspectives, it was largely a waste of time for me and certainly not a book I will recommend to anyone.
B0013V33DG|4.0|This performance is destined to become a classic. Natalie Dessay is magnificent in the role of Marie: sort of I Love Lucy with high notes. Even people who don't like opera enjoy this one. The camera work does not capture the full impact of the physical comedy. Sometimes we hear the audience laughing but can't tell why. In one particularly infuriating instance, the camera spends an eterninty scanning a silly poster while we miss all the action on the stage. Still, a great DVD.

0802130208|5.0|When I read the words \\"hunting cap,\\" I thought of Holden Caulfield, and that is what Ignatius Riley reminds me of. Ignatius is a keen observer of human life, and spares no words in voicing his literate opinion on everything. Everyone's got to listen, because like Holden, Ignatius is so smart he's got to be right about everything. Perhaps Ignatius is really Holden as a 30-year-old?  The star (or shall I say \\"ignored genius\\") of the story is Ignatius Riley; thirty years old, obese, gluttonous, messy, lazy, and with ten years of college under his belt (though it's not clear if he ever graduated). Now he's back at his mother's ramshackle house in New Orleans, lounging in his (filthy) room in his (filthy) nightshirt, writing endless raving on paper tablets. When he's not stinking up his room, he's wandering around 1960's New Orleans in his hunting cap, shouting his opinions on everything and making a nuisance of himself. Ignatius is a mad raving lunatic, but quite and amusing one.  What struck me as Ignatius' most marked characteristic is his habit of taking a job and ruining his employer, despite the fact that he's able to do well at work. He persuades his boss to let him come late to work every day, organizes the workers to hold a strike, then messes it all up at the end. He takes a job selling hot dogs, and then nearly ruins the entire business by eating them himself. May I add that by the end of the novel, his weight is ballooning to mega-proportions?  Confederacy of Dunces is a good title for the book. Ignatius is the type of person who's so convinced of his abilities that he regards everyone else as a fool. He's a lot like Holden Caulfield in that he's smart, but not practical. But while Holden had rich parents in Manhattan who subsidized his habits, Ignatius Riley has only his mother, living in poverty in New Orleans, with barely enough money to keep herself going. And did I say she spent her mother's life insurance policy sending her son to college for ten years?Did he do anything to repay her? Of course not! But then again, it's not easy for a genius like Ignatius Riley, especially when the people around him are nothing but a \\"Confederacy of Dunces.\\"

B000001F7R|5.0|I had this on vinyl back in the day, but my other DL records were on so much they pretty much eclipsed this one as far as spin time.  I just bought it last week again on CD and am really enjoying it.  I think it's much better than just a decent debut by an up and coming band, or an interesting look at DL before they hit the sound they would run with.  Anyone who heard this at the time it came out would have to have realized this band was going no where but up, up, up.    In fact if this album had gotten the production it deserved DL could have gotten an even earlier launch.  As it happened though, hearing just this single debut album made John \\"Mutt\\" Lange to realize that DL was a band worth working with.  He had produced both Highway to Hell and Back In Black, for AC/DC and had an undeniable role in getting AC/DC to superstardom.  I can't think of any other music producer with 2 diamond albums by different bands to their credit, diamond being sales of 10M just domestically.  With this, you will hear what made up his mind to work with this awesome then hard-rockin' band: a great cohesive sound bursting with talent and a powerful synergy within the band that allowed them to explore some different directions equally impressively.  This album is completely different from other DL in ways other reviewers have covered.  It is not the glam sound DL wound up with on Pyro-which is also a great album, by the way, and it's completely--like night and day--different even from High 'N' Dry, with Lange producing, which came out right after this the very next year.  (I think High 'N' Dry rivals Back In Black, by AC/DC, and I'm not even a 'fan' per se of Def Leppard--don't have most of their CD's, etc.)  This is straight heavy metal, with pounding stick work, crashing chords, sizzling riffs and ripping, over the top guitar solos.    This album is usually considered as a definitive album of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal.  What that means is--wierd as it sounds--overall you'llhear something much closer to Judas Priest a la their British Steel album.  In fact, some songs would have fit seamlessly on to that album if you just dubbed Rob Halford's vocals over Joe Elliott's.  Wierd to think, I know, and it makes this disk a real audio adventure when you remember that it's actually Def Leppard that you're listening to--with basically the same line up that does the songs you are familiar with!     The fact that DL could sound so good in three completely different ways, in three consecutive albums--bang, bang, bang--just speaks to the talent of this great band all the more.  So get this, put it on, turn it up and treat yourself to the first of those different, great sounds.

0143034901|3.0|The Publisher's Weekly review and the one by Steve Koss have it about right.  The book's concept and plot are intriguing, but the quality of the writing and some completely implausible incidents and details don't hold up to close attention.  That said, I read all 470 pages and finished them feeling torn between being satisfied to see how it all ended and thinking that I'd wasted my time. If you don't expect or demand a literary quality of writing and if you can suspend disbelief, it's a pretty fun ride.

After reading this book I recently learned of another SEAL, a childhood friend, who gave his life serving the Iraqis.  It's so refreshing to learn that our country still produces such extraordinary men.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|Prerequisite non-viewing for this latest Indiana Jones film has surely got to be Chariots of the Gods and Independence Day - If you've seen either of these, you see it coming.    Entertaining, sure.  The formula Indiana Jones plot works exactly the same as it did in the other three pictures, the lead-in adventure sequence, the ivy league school, entanglements with various baddies, a graveyard / catacomb, and so on.      Russians as the villians?  Bozhe moi.  Granted that given the period, 1957, the Russians were the only choice, commercial potential of Nazis having been exhausted 20 years earlier.  Like the \\"Axis of Evil\\" comment much earlier, this sets diplomacy back to pre-Cheronbyl times.    I protest, however, the use of non-Genuine Russian actors playing speaking parts of Russians.  The last time I heard decent Russian on any film was on Krassny Rossvyet, Red Dawn, featuring stars from Dirty Dancing.  Although Cate Blanchett did a fine Natasha imitation and with just that touch of evil in a Mia Wallace sort of way, perhaps a better choice for that role would have been Milla Jojovich.  Easy on the eyes and ears.    All in all, it was nice to Indy back, to see Karen Allen again, and I found Shia LeBoeuf to be a worthy sidekick.  I suppose the closing scene closes the doors on any possible sequel, but you never know.

If you are a real Cult fan and not just a radiohead, you'll \\"get it\\". The only album where the boys came close to selling out was the \\"Temple\\" and Ian has stated he tired of the material quickly. Billy and Ian don't care about you, man, it's about the music!!

0765342294|5.0|Zach T.        5/24/08         BLOG       Enders Game is a book about a kid named Andrew (Ender) Wiggin who is six years old and has a monitor on his neck. A monitor is a device that the IF (International Fleet) put on kids to see if they have what it takes to save the world from buggers. Ender has a brother named Peter and a sister named Valentine. Ender is accepted to a special school to save the world from aliens (buggers). His brother and sister unfortunately, weren't accepted to the school. Peter gets mad at Ender because he was accepted, but he wasn't. Before Ender got accepted to the school, he hurt a child badly. When this happened Ender felt horrible. On the way to the battle school Ender figures out that if he didn't hurt the child he wouldn't have been accepted to the battle school. The battle school is in outer space. When he reaches the school he goes to his battle group called Launchies. Launchies are for beginners that are not experienced with the strategies. Ender is immediately put in a higher group called the Salamander Army. The Salamander Army fight against other Armies to see who has what it takes to save the world. In each army there is a commander who is in charge of the strategies in the battles for each team. The Salamander Armies commander was Bonzo Madrid. When Bonzo saw Ender he immediately didn't want him. He made Ender do nothing in the tournaments and waited for a team to take him. Finally a team took him. Ender didn't last very long in that group though. After a couple of days he became a commander for the Phoenix Army. When he was commander he won every game. When Bonzo lost to him he wanted to kill Ender. When Ender was taking a shower Bonzo and his friends went to the bathroom and tried t get Ender. Ender was prepared and killed Bonzo easily. After he killed Bonzo he was sent to combat school to save the world. When Ender got there he saw an old man in his room. Ender tried to get out but couldn't. Soon Ender got mad and charged atthe man. The old man immediately grabbed Ender and through him. When the old man got back to his position Ender attacked again. It was an instant replay to what happened the first time. Finally, the man spoke and said he was Mazer Rackham the man who killed the buggers before.

B00005JPNZ|4.0|Dust off the old brown fedora and crack out the whip, Dr. Jones is back....Dr. Henry Walton Jones, Jr., that is!  For the long awaited fourth installment of the Indiana Jones franchise, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg bring the aging action hero back to life, older and worn but still finding himself at the center of amazing archeologicial adventures.<br /><br />  After a run-in with Russian baddie, Irina Spalko, played by Cate Blanchett (a deliciously wicked villainess, by the way!) and drawing the attention of the FBI, Jones is forced into a leave of absence from his professorship at the university.  Before he can get out of town, however, a young man named Mutt Williams, (played by Hollywood's current \\"IT\\" boy, Shia LeBouf, in full-on Marlon Brando/James Dean mode) convinces the doctor to take a look at the case of a crystal skull, an artifact believed to be part of the Amazonian legend of the mysterious city of gold---in fact, a key to finding the well hidden city.  With a mutual friend, Oxley, in jeopardy as well as Mutt's mom in peril, the two adventurers set off for Peru to find Oxley's whereabouts and search for the crystal skull.  Of course, the Russians, led by Irina, are not far behind, racing neck and neck, as one would expect, in order to find the artifact and the city's mysteries and treasures.<br /><br />  Indy 4 is a fun ride, a nostalgic return for many of us to the days of our youth.  This addition to the franchise is entertaining, full of great CGI effects and give us both familiar and new characters, welcomed additions to the Indy universe.  All the essential elements are there for an Indiana Jones film---nail-biting chase sequences, the inevitable Indy snake scene, a little romance and some great one liners!  Although I enjoyed the movie, I will say there was something lacking from the film that I found so pleasing in the earlier films.  I'm not sure what it is, to be honest, but there was just a missing spark that left me not quite satisified.  Nonetheless, it is a worthy addition to a summer movie season that seems to be brimming with more hits than misses---and for that, I am grateful!<br /><br />  Harrison Ford does well as the older Indy and falls into his role with apparent ease.  Cate Blanchett with her tidy bob haircut and pale skin is an icy and ambitious foe, a worthy adversary for Indy and Co.  Mutt is an interesting new addition to the cast though a certain revelation about him midway through the film can be seen a mile away.  And, the return of Miriam (Kate Allen), the hard drinking, acid-tongued heroine of the film that started it all, takes the fans full circle. Jim Broadbent and John Hurt, both fine actors, figure into the story, though Broadbent to a lesser degree.<br /><br />  The ending sets the stage for a possible new chapter in the Indy chronicles with Mutt, perhaps, as the heir to Indiana's adventurous ways. I'm sure we haven't seen the last of Dr. Jones, and with this weekend's huge talley (something like 126 million not counting the actual Memorial Day take) it is likely in a few years we'll be watching a fifth installment...and I doubt you'll get few complaints about that!etheless, it is a worthy addition to a summer movie season that seems to be brimming with more hits than misses---and for that, I am grateful!

B0015D3Z4O|2.0|Total review in a few words? Overall, I'm non-plussed.<br /><br />There is nothing on here that isn't anything Nelly Farturdo, Gwen Stefani and a host of other middle of the road artists haven't done in the last five years.<br /><br />This kind of bland hip-hop that is meant to cater to white folk and radio programmers is just lame. Releasing 'Hard Candy' makes Madonna the equivalent of the 55 year old man who wears a pony tail and an earring to make him feel young and hip, when all it really does is bring attention to how old he really is.<br /><br />The first single, \\"4 Minutes\\" is probably the most accessible, but it isn't as much 'a song' as it is spliced together phrases that they've edited into a completed song. Ironically, they go over by 0:00:03 (since they have 4 minutes to save the world) but the song effectively ends at the 3:41 mark. They couldn't even muster up the energy for 20 more seconds of real or looped music. It's also weird how Justin Timberlake's vocals are almost indistinguishable to that of Madonna's.<br /><br />The only other song that kind of, sort of, resonated with me was \\"Give It 2 Me\\". The \\"rap\\" in the middle is horrible and distracting from what is/was otherwise a decent song, even if it has elements of Kylie Minogue's \\"Slow\\".<br /><br />But the rest is pretty much throw away. The overused lyrical phrases and the 'moon-june-spoon' rhyme scheme is boring.<br /><br />I finally figured out why all the \\"guest artists\\" keep saying/singing the word \\"Madonna\\" - because, they have to remind you whose album you're actually listening to - since it could be just about anyone. Or that her ego is so huge, she has to hear someone say it at timed intervals.<br /><br />This has been placed into my digital catalog, but I won't be rotating through it often.
B00110K62U|3.0|While it is nice to have this on DVD, with a widescreen picture, it isn't enough to make up for the poor quality of everything else that comes along with this release. In fact, the video quality isn't better in any way to the original VHS release.     Les Mis is one of my favourite musicals and I listen to the concert CD soundtrack all the time. I was looking forward to getting this on DVD so that I could watch it with DVD quality audio, which would be a vast improvement over the original VHS release. Boy, was I ever wrong with that assumption.     The audio is embarassingly terrible, with actual distortion in the mix. The original 2CD soundtrack to the concert sounds infinitely better, so there is no excuse for a new DVD release to actually sound worse. Somehow, they managed it with this.     And the commemorative booklet that comes inside is a joke! Grainy screenshots and the same old regurgitated text does not a commemorative booklet make. Once again the packaging doesn't live up to the CD packaging, which came with a marvelous booklet that was truly special.     And then there is the issue of footage being cut out which is, quite simply, a blunder of the highest order. Skip this, send the message that this travesty of a release should not be tolerated.

B0010X8NF0|1.0|I admire Anderson's films like The Royal Tenenbaums and Life Aquatic a great deal, they're among my favorites. It was a disappointment then that I didn't feel any of the same pleasure in watching his latest.    Darjeeling chronicles the barely adventures of 3 brothers in India. It feels boring, awkward, and a bit like having someone ram bad jokes at you over and over with the many running gags, none of which is clever. The biggest problem I had is these are different characters than the usual Wes Anderson-verse, or rather, they feel like what would usually be bit characters with 3 lines. I can guess, but I don't know for sure, that this movie might be some kind of homage to 60's films. I wasn't alive then and don't seek out Beatles movies for fun, so I wouldn't know. If that's the case though I have to say I'm let down. I've come to respect Anderson as someone making movies with a deep helping of everything, from character depth to comedy... so if he's moved to one-dimensional parody of older films, what a waste.    Hopefully, this is a one-off trip into dullsville and his next film is great.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Perfectly cast and executed tremendously with laid back ease, \\"Iron Man\\" is proof that Marvel still has what it takes to dish out the good stuff. I have to admit that I was starting to worry about the future of Marvel's films after seeing the pathetic \\"Spider-Man 3\\", \\"Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer\\", \\"Ghost Rider\\" & \\"Elektra\\", but \\"Iron Man\\" has put life into a franchise that has seemingly been going downhill, ... quality wise that is.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. has done something with his Superhero that other actors have yet to try with theirs, ... loosen up, have fun and add some humor. The screenplay does a wonderful job of adding issues that American's fear at this particular point in time, using the war on terror to make the film more realistic and envolving. Also, Jeff Bridges really does break out in the second half of the film to create quite a villianous character.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00005JPNZ|5.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a marvelous final film in the Jones series, to say nothing of the fine action sequences that one has come to expect from this series.  All of the elements are here: the chase scenes, a creepy scene in a graveyard, clues to the mystery of the crystal skull provided by Professor Oxley and encounters with huge killed red ants, hostile natives and an amazing opening sequence ending with an atomic bomb test.     It will go without saying that Harrison Ford reprises his role as Indiana Jones wonderfully but it is an older Jones who has had quite a few wartime adventures that we meet.  Cate Blanchett (Dr. Irina Spalko) is nicely cast and makes a good sword-carrying villain; she is marvelously single-minded pursuit of the crystal skull. Shia LeBouef really steals the film as Mutt Williams and is the quintessential 1950's motorcycle riding school dropout always worried about how his hair looks.  It was very good to see Karen Allen again in an Indiana Jones film as Marion (also Mutt William's mother); she brought a lot of energy to the film and her verbal sparing with Indiana Jones was a delight. John Hurt plays Professor Oxley, an archaeologist friend of Jones (nicknamed Ox), who is like a father figure to Mutt and found the crystal skull but mysteriously returned it.  Ray Winstone was good in the small role of McHale, who was certainly not to be trusted (but Indiana Jones is willing to forget his early double dealing for old time's sake).  Jim Broadbent is also good in the brief role of Dean Stanforth (substituting for the late Denholm Elliot who is nevertheless in on the action when a statue of Marcus Brody is crashed into by the KGB).      My only problem with the film is the ending which I did not think was quite clear.  What was the reward for returning the crystal skull? In Raider's of the Lost Ark the villains are destroyed by the prize they think they have found. Dr. Spalko meet a similar fate in her quest for the ultimate psychic knowledge but one wonders what Professor Oxley's reward is for returning the skull was supposed to be.  I found the ending a bit anticlimactic on first viewing but I may change my opinion after I have seen the film more than one.     The production and locations are fabulous and John Williams has once again written a great score.  Indiana Jones 4 will definitely be added to our DVD collection.
B00005OM4K|5.0|Creedence never die.  I'm a big fan of their music, and now with these cd pack i can feel the firsts sounds of the band.  I'm realy enjoying the firsts achords of Creedence Clearwater Revival.  And btw it sounds really great. High definition sound without \\"back rain\\".
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I now have both the 1994 version and the 2007 version.  I love this story.  The cast is wonderful, and the adaptation is great.  I missed the showing of Persuasion on PBS, but I understand they cut a lot of the important parts.  If you saw the PBS version, you have to see the DVD to see what you missed.  It will make more sense.

B001437DMA|5.0|I enjoy listening to Joe.  Some of his albums take a little getting used to, but this is not one of them.  I listened to the previews on his website, and was determined to get it.<br /><br />This album reminds me more of the old Joe, not the Joe that dabbled in Techno.  I have nothing against Techno, but that just doesn't seem to fit with Joe and his music.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend this album to Joe lovers, and everyone else.

B00005JPNY|2.0|If you read the book first you might be able to make sense of this stinker.  The special effects are excellent but that is the only thing that is really first rate.  Kidman gets to wear some snazzy clothes but fails to be convincing as the evil ice queen.  The children are equipped with accents which are to render them convincing I guess but which really only makes them more difficult to understand and adds nothing to advance the story.  The special effects, especially the deamons and armored bears, and the sets are the only thing this thing has going for it.  The folks who are up in arms that this is anti-organized relegion are really working for it.  I would guess that someone who had not read the book would have some idea that there is something bad afoot but the whole thing is so vague and ill-defined it fails to hold interest.  I was very disappointed as I had high hopes for Sam Elliott but am not sure why he even bothered to show up for this.  Dakota Blue's abilities are apparent but fail to flesh out this deflated come on.  Buy a poster of the armored bear and save your money on the movie unless you really really like special effects.

B000063DFS|2.0|I've always liked Ozzy with or without Black Sabbath.    No more tears has mostly ok songs but few stand out as excellent.  Mr. Tinkertrain has strange lyrics but is probably the best song on the cd.  Hellraiser is a motorhead song featured at the end of Hellraiser 3 and Ozzy's version of it is pretty good.  Zombie stomp is interesting and cool sounding.  Desire is melodic.    The complaints are that No more tears has a weak mixing and mastering production. It doesn't have that rich and resonating heavy sound you hear in a lot of good sounding metal cds.  Also you can also tell this was recorded when Ozzy wasn't at his prime. His voice sounds a little bit strained and shot.  Zack is great guitarist but he doesn't get to show off his skills too much or too often on this cd. There are also too many cornball ballads on this.  .    I give no more tears a C+
B000Y179KO|3.0|Would've been a five star if they would've skipped Henley's rants and shaved it down to one disc. I've got a surprise for you Don, I love God, football and America! You must be a very unhappy person. When are these elitists like Henley, Springsteen, Mellencamp, Fogerty, and Young going to realize we don't give a crap about their political positions? Then they wonder why they can't sell albums anymore. NOBODY CARES, WE LISTEN TO YOUR MUSIC FOR THE MUSIC NOT FOR YOU TO TELL US HOW AWFUL R COUNTRY IS AND HOW STUPID WE ALL ARE AND CAN'T THINK FOR OURSELVES. REMEMBER WHO PUT YOU IN THE POSITIONS YOU'RE IN...THE FANS! ROCK IS DEFINITELY DEAD!!!
B0000069NM|3.0|This is a good album, though a few of the tracks are fairly uninspired. Not sure why it's so highly praised. I think MMW freaks are more into it than Sco freaks. I'm a Sco freak, and to my ears, he's recorded much better albums. (Hand Jive, Groove Elation, Uberjam, Up All Night, Bump). MMW's music is a bit too diffuse for me; I don't have the patience to wait around for them to get inspired. Scofield's music is much more focused and disciplined, even when he's \\"jamming.\\"  Neither his writing nor his playing on this album are up to his usual standards.
0893815233|5.0|I love these photographs. They have amazing soul and power inside them. Brilliant exposures and a great looking family.
B0010X8NF0|1.0|This film is an almost perfect flop. The characters are rigid, wooden, emotionally dull and unidimensional, the script fuzzy and pointless; in other words, the film reflects a not-very- bright  dopester's idea of a fun and profound life. Unfortunately, Anderson seems to be  oblivious of the fact that Yellow Submarine has already been made - 40 years ago by people who were crazier, smarter and more creative than him.<br /><br />And the film is not funny! The tired pseudo-spirituality jokes and, especially, the boring and pointless 1st part which was made so that Wes could spend a week in Paris with Portman - help this film to tank utterly and completely.<br /><br />The India shown in DL is not the real India but an edited-into-oblivion, fantasized and disemboweled version of it. Nor do we see real Indians but rather bleached, sanitized non-entities, some (like the lovely Rita maid character) with a London accent.<br /><br />The only redeeming point here (in addition to the iPod gags) is the cinematography set into the beautiful landscapes of Rajasthan. The visuals (enhanced by a huge team of local painters) are excellent, warm blues, yellows and greens, the enhanced clarity of detail - as if everyone on the set was tripping.  Which they probably were.

1596061855|1.0|This is the first cyberpunk book I have ever attempted to read and I must say that while it contains some interesting concepts, the execution of the storyline is just awful.    I read 400+ pages, got within 70 pages of the end and decided that I really didn't care anymore. It was impossible to figure out what was happening, why it was happening and why the characters were responding the way they were.     Overall, a mess.

B0013J30XG|2.0|Talk about a dead engine. After sitting through this loud, headache inducing, mind-numbing color-vomiting mess of a childrens' movie, I really wanted to find the W-Brothers' home phone number and ask them WTF were you thinking? Were you really out to make a 'family film' that went on for over two-hours? Did you really intend to put in insipid wall-collision scene stoppers with Spridle and Chim-Chim where ever you could? Did John Goodman's fight scene look like you envisioned it or was it supposed to look inane?<br /><br />Holy cow, what a waste of time. Emile Hirsch and John Goodman do an admirable job of recreating their cartoon counterparts, but everyone else is reduced to banalities and hopeless mugging. The villain, as played by Roger Allom, is so over-the-top oily that he could have lubed the entire fleet of CGI vehicles. The constant use of screen wipes using tight shots of his face got to be aggravating to the point of distraction, an effect used to show cleverness more than anything else. Same for the endless race scenes, which looked mostly like hyper-hallucinatory giant hot-wheels toys.<br /><br />Oh wait, the plot. Family loyalty is good, corporate monsters are bad. Which is not a bad message, but it gets buried beneath the barrage of primary colors and bright flashing splatter. While the final race, the Grand Prix, is actually exciting, it comes so late in the film that you're already reaching for the Advil. Racer X (Lost's Matthew Fox, given little to do except look solemn and spout dopey Zen racing dialogue like \\"You don't climb into a T-180 to be a driver. You do it because you're driven\\") and Christina Ricci (forced to utter \\"cool beans\\" alot) are window dressing to the hyperkinetic action zooming around them. Every time Speed and Trixie try to set off sparks, Spridle is there to annoy you. The road to the races are filled with irritating speed bumps. I was really wanting this to end before the Grand Prix finally started.<br /><br />About the nicest thing I can say about this screeching blue-print for a video game is I bet it will look great on your Blu-Ray system. But to everyone else, deploy your airbags and stay away. This Speed Racer is one bad ride.is screeching blue-print for a video game is I bet it will look great on your Blu-Ray system.

B000ICLRIE|5.0|The theatrical version of the movie was excellent, and contained much food for thought in a world wracked by religious wars.  I purchased the Blu-Ray edition expecting spectacular battle sequences, and I was not disappointed.  However, there is much more to this disk.  This is an extended version, and unlike many deleted scenes, the additional scenes in this edition make the story much more alive.  I felt that I understood the movie, the characters and their motivation, much better.  This is the version that should have been released to the theaters.

Other movie is okay lot's of action and great sound effects on a dts surround sound system.  How about making clean movies without the profanity in them, it's not needed lessens the movie and shows actors will do anything for money. No matter what.

Now don't get me wrong this book won't make you a professional luthier overnight, but it will give you a good base and starting point. All you need is the wood.
B0015519VS|5.0|Coming off a Diamond selling release, I thought this album would be a letdown compared to Confessions.  So far I'm not necessarily saying I like it better but I think it's more creative. I've been listening to this album since the leak(about a week and a half before release)and have been very impressed.  So impressed that I walked 4 miles to buy it today(tryin' to conserve gas, lol) Usher is never an artist to drop 10-11 tracks and 4 interludes every year but someone you can expect 18-20 tracks w/ no interludes from every 2-3 years.  He usually only has the best featured artists on his albums and this one only features the top in the industry.  Jay-z(one of the best ever), Beyonce(one of the most commercially successful artist since Jay-z), Lil' Wayne(I'm not a huge fan, but a lot of people like him), and Young Jeezy(never seems to disappoint when featured on a track).  I was hoping for a track with Ludacris because every song they've done together in the past has been crazy, but Luda is more of a club/party artist and this is more of an adult CD.  As a whole the album is great.  I doubt it will hit diamond like Confessions(we're living in a time where everyone bootlegs and no one purchases), but I can see it selling a few million.    He gave up a lot of the pop that he had done in the past and focused more on R&B.  Everybody always has a problem when an artist grows up and changes; but that's what the music industry is all about, maturation.  Like Jay-z was criticized for Kingdom Come and American Gangster, why?  Because he had matured and grown up.  Same goes for Eminem, towards the end of his career he was criticized for his music but all of it was grown up meaningful music.  Same goes for Usher on this one, people don't like change in an artist.    Every song has a creative meaning.  For example the song \\"his mistake\\"(probably my favorite song on the CD) is about how women compare their current love to the one before, and if the previous one did her bad then themistakes he made will be held against the current love, regardless of weather he's doing wrong.  Throughout the song Usher says \\"I refuse to stay payin for his mistakes\\".  It's a very creative well thought song.    Another one of my favorites is \\"Before I Met You\\".  It is a song about how a women can bring out the best in a man.  Throughout the song he says \\"I was a hustler and player girl before I met you/I'd drink a lil something then hit a lil something/But how you made a difference, look what i've been missing/You got my life together and I thank you forever.\\"    \\"What's a Man to Do\\" is another great track from the album.  Where he talks about his love \\"being in to different places\\" and \\"having two different faces\\".    Another good track is Here I stand, it also has a hidden track after it.  If you leave the track on for 3 minutes after it ends another track will come on, that's also very creative.    \\"Trading Places\\" is a very unique track about switching places with the female for a night, she takes him out, she's on top, etc.      Usher's talent could never be questioned but in my opinion he really expanded his repertoire on this album.  I really suggest it.
1430300612|5.0|People, in general, describe any person who perceives phenomena unobvious to them as hallucinating (perception in a conscious state yet in the absence of a real external stimulus). Dr. J.Taylor, being herself an achieved neuroanatomist, in her extraordinary book, introduces the reader (skeptic or not) to the capabilities of our right brain which she was able to unravel through her serendipitous brain injury. Thus, encouraging people who seek peace and  tranquility in their lives to turn to the untapped potentials of their right brain. A description for what to expect in that realm with practical suggestions for meditators on how to reach that state is also provided.    An excellent book for truth seekers.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|I struggled, thinking, okay, it's a four star, sometimes five star film, but the ending, the motivation of the characters and overt violence did the film in. Three stars for beautiful cinemotography and a mesmerizing Danial-Day Lewis, an interesting take on the early oil business, but that's about it. Depressing really!
140120306X|2.0|All the elements are there but for some reason the souffle didn't rise.  This book will be forgotten.  All the bling extras of Moore books - such as additional cover pages and text short stories -- go from side shows to main event, to the book's detriment, rising up like story assassins to smite this tome into a coma.  In short, it was boring.
B000F7OMZ2|5.0|I have taken allot of criticism for stating this is the best of all of the Jones films. Regardless of everyone that says I'm crazy, I think if you are looking for some of the best actions sequences in film, this is the movie to see. From the moment the motley crew of Willie, Short Round, and Indy fell out of the sky in a rubber raft, the movie began its tour de force. When I talk Indy with my friends, they don't beleive me that this is the best, but I remind them that out of all the films, \\"Temple\\" has the most memorable scenes. From the famous dinner sequence, to the heart/pit drop, to the roller coaster mine shaft chase - to finally, the climax on the bridge, the action never stops. In fact, I believe the climax on the bridge not only to be one of the greatest action scenes in all of the Indy flicks, but of all action movies in general. Say what you will, but when you think of awesome Indy scenes, chances are, you will mention The Temple of Doom.

0743289692|5.0|A lot of reviewers seem to be reviewing the author or her politics, rather than this book.    With minimal attention to the validity of Hirsi Ali's politics, or her character, Infidel is an excellent autobiography for a number of reasons:    Infidel is extremely readable. The pace is balanced between dramatic page-turning moments and slower more pensive sections. The scale is very human throughout, as well as very personal, even when discussing issues of Dutch national politics. From the first page, it's about Hirsi Ali's sense of identity, and her lifelong struggle with that sense. This is why it remains a good autobio, and a bad 'manifesto' or political treatise.    Hirsi Ali's tone throughout is fairly humble. It's easy to tell that she is extremely stubborn, outspoken, and arrogant... and most of her stories do reflect well on her, or highlight her victimization. But at the same time, she owns up to actions of which she now disapproves, and does include stories that reflect poorly on her. The result is that I 'liked' her the whole time, which is a good quality in an autobiography.    In a way that's unusual for an autobio, Infidel builds up on itself. Stories that seem tangential are shown to have pertinence later, without a disruption to the narrative or an explicit connect-the-dots. The result is that I feel that I understand the decades-long experience that have made Hirsi Ali who she is, and what she stands for. Regardless of whether or not I like her politics or agree with her, having read Infidel, I can understand *why* she is where she is.    Finally, it's a compelling read because the story is bigger than one woman.  Although she keeps the focus on her own experience, a large part of her personal motivation came from seeing that her own level of physical and mental abuse was not unique in her community. This expands the autobio to be reflective of a larger group - not all muslim women, but a sizable number of them. As is clearly Hirsi Ali's intent, thisprovokes a lot of thought and discussion amongst readers. Whether this makes for a 'better' autobio or a 'worse' one is debatable, but it is certainly a more powerful/impactful/weighty book as a result.        An excellent read!

B00000K3UU|3.0|Growing up is sometimes hard to do.  You leave behind the carefree days when someone else was still responsible for you as you took your first steps towards independence.  Our parents did the best they could in cutting the umbilical cord and sending us on our way.  For most of us, this transition felt normal and was achieved without much pain.  However, for a few, growing pains continued beyond what was considered normal or prudent.<br /><br />Over Memorial Day weekend, I sort of had an old movie watching extravaganza and ended up watching a few films.  One of these films was Big Daddy.  Big Daddy was produced in 1999 and featured the Sprouse twins (Dylan and Cole) playing the same role of  Julian \\"Frankenstein\\" McGrath who is a 5 year child sent from Buffalo, New York to be reunited with this father who he has never seen.  His mother has passed away and she wanted Julian to be with his biological Dad.  Of course, this is also a big surprise for everyone including Gerrity.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is that Dad (Kevin Gerrity' who is played by Jon Stewart) does not know anything about Julian or in fact that he even exists and as fate has it is on his way to China on business.  Sonny Koufax played by Adam Sandler is the one who opens the door and finds the five year Julian on his stoop.  Sonny in the end finds more than Julian that fateful day and learns a lot about himself.<br /><br />Adam Sandler as his typical funny self plays a bright would be lawyer who  is an irresponsible slob; a guy who cannot get it altogether even though all of his friends have moved on with their careers and lives sort of leaving him far behind.  Adam is feeling this particularly when he opens his door and finds Julian standing there; since Sandler also just found himself losing his girlfriend to boot.<br /><br />The film shows Adam at his funny best and if you are a Sandler fan you will like this movie. Layla Maloney played by Joey Lauren Adams is a sweet role and Adams in this role reminds me a little of Renee Zellwegger in Jerry Maguire.<br /><br />In the final analysis, love wins out and everybody lives happily ever.  The movie promotes family love and values and is a feel good movie which most likely if you are a Jon Stewart or an Adam Sandler fan will not disappoint you.<br /><br />Some coarse segments as another reviewer mentioned which influenced me and was one of the reasons that I did not give it four stars though I enjoyed the movie on the whole very much.  It was funny, light and kept you laughing.  If you intend to watch this flick with your children, there are more than a few stunts that you may not enjoy your own children doing or getting any ideas about.  So be forewarned.  But overall still a funny film.<br /><br />Three stars for this feel good movie.<br /><br />Bentley/2008<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000K3UU Big Daddy]]enee Zellwegger in Jerry Maguire.

B00005LK95|3.0|This film should be rated PG-13 due to the prolific swearing in nearly every scene.  There were even a couple of sexual references.  My 3 year old pulled this off the shelf at the rental store from the family section.  He's seen the ads for the upcoming Walle movie and the robot on the cover of this DVD box has a similar look.<br /><br />While this film might appear at first glance to be a good candidate for family viewing - it isn't.  Adult's who liked the first film will probably enjoy this sequel, but keep it out of reach of your young children, unless you'd like to expand their vocabulary!
0452287588|3.0|A New Earth is only okay in my book.  I am a Christian and it unfortunately doesn't take that much into account.  In fact, at times, I felt as if it were discounting my belief system.  On the positive, the one thing I really value about the book is the premise of living in the present moment.  It really hit home with me that I often think too much about the past or often anticipate the future constantly.  Then where is the present?  Gone...never to appear again.  So this is a valuable thing to get out of any reading.
032147404X|5.0|What a fantastic book. I really cant say enough about how much this book just stripped away all the B-S and gave me exactly what I was looking for. Sure, I have other books to tell me all the background details (which will take years of study to master) but in the mean time this book helped me hit the ground running. One quick afternoon of reading and the very next day my shots had improved. I will be immediately purchasing the second volume.     One caveat - you need a sense of humor. Kelby has a very dry sense of humor that I found just endlessly entertaining, but I do notice that a few people prefer their books to be boring. If you like boring instruction manuals, this book is not for you.
B00000I661|1.0|Side 2 of the Second record in this 3 LP album doesn't play right. James Hetfield sounds like one of the Chipmunks and the band plays so fast it sounds like they're on Speed. There must have been a mistake at the factory because I had Amazon replace this album for me and the 2nd copy did the exact same thing as the first one! So, I asked for a refund. That was a very sad moment for me. I really wanted to hear Metallica's tribute to Mercyful Fate on Vynil...    If you really want Garage Inc. on vynil, wait until Metallica re-issues it sometime in the near future. They're doing that with all their albums in celebration of Kill'em All's 25th anniversary.
1569242739|5.0|I've been baking a new recipe every week since I got this book!  It's fantastic.  The basic recipes alone would be enough to get you through any birthday party -- there's basic vanilla and chocolate, and frosting recipes for each.  Just like Betty Crocker used to make, except there're no eggs or dairy.  The vast majority of the ingredients are pantry standards for me, like sugar, salt, soy milk, flour.  It's only for the more special recipes that I've had to search out some unique ingredients like maple extract or agar flakes, and an early introductory section helps you locate or substitute ingredients if need be.  Once you get into the Classic and Fancy recipe sections, you realize how innovative the authors are and what a resource they've created.  Carrot Cake, S'More, Tiramisu, Lemon Macadamia - these are just a few of the recipes I've tried, so far everything's been excellent.  This book should be standard-issue for any new vegan: you get your B12 supplements, your pleather shoes, and your copy of Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World.
1559277246|5.0|THe Stephanie Plum series is just great fun! I am so entertained when I listen to these books, and it makes my commute (45 min to an hour each way) something I actually look forward to! IT's laugh out loud funny, sexy, (but NOT vulgar.. it leaves a lot to your imagination, which is a rare treat these days), and the characters are really well developed. It's like you know them personally and can't wait to hear what they will get into next. While often times predictable, it doesn't take away the fun. And who doesn't love Lula?!

B0000AK7AB|5.0|I just love this movie -- if I have to watch tv with the kids, this is my choice.  It gives models for great virtues:<br /><br />+  innocence<br />+  trust<br />+  defending the weak<br />+  good manners<br />+  patience<br /><br />the little mice that sing and talk at the opening/closing of each \\"Chapter\\" are hilarious.<br /><br />The movie has no dark and scary parts -- my kids are still too little to handle much suspense.  It is a gentle and sweet kids' (and adults') movie<br />and I get a big kick out of it.<br /><br />And Babe engages in NO SASS at all.  NONE.  Hooray!<br /><br />Language note:  One \\"my God\\", several \\"stupid/idiot/moron\\", and one \\"butt-head\\".  Thought you should know.  We handle that by watching together so I can remind them: \\"we never say that.\\"  \\"We know, we KNOW, Mom!\\"
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Sometimes, I like to shake it up a little - buy something that I find suggested by others that is a real departure from my standard listening fare.  Melody Gardot's \\"Worrisome Heart\\" was just such a wild card and I gotta tell you ... this CD is nothing short of brilliant.  I am SO glad I took the chance and SO thrilled with the discovery that I'm a little overwhelmed.  If you have ever wanted the perfect candlelight dinner music, you have found it.  Also exquisite for night driving or the occasional sob on behalf of love gone wrong.  Ms. Gardot's voice is breathtakingly smooth and elegant without trying to be anything at all, which contributes to its intimate feel.  Such a find ... really, just quit waffling and add it to your cart.  Sensational.
B000YABYLA|5.0|This movie is a must see for all young people that are becoming \\"sexually active\\" ha ha. No for real, it is a movie that may influence someone to be more careful with contraception. The story is believeable and Jennifer Garner almost broke my heart.
B00127RAJY|3.0|First off, I would give it 3 ½ stars.  I've only done level one but it is a good, very intense work out.  I felt great afterwards. Also, I really like the trainer.  She motivated me to push my hardest to try and finish each exercise, which sometimes I couldn't do (and I consider myself to be in good shape). My biggest complaint about the DVD is that you are told to start with level 1 and then progress up to level 2, then level 3.  But there is only one level 1 workout, one level 2 workout and one level 3 workout.  As a result, you are doing the same workout every day until you can move up a level.  This can get boring.  In addition, you are working the same tired and sore muscles that you worked the day before.  My other complaints are a bit petty: the music is terrible and you can't skip through some of the beginning stuff.  As stated above, the workouts are great and extremely challenging but I wouldn't use this DVD alone.     **********************************************************  UPDATE:    I would now give this video 5 stars.  One of the comments to my review suggested that I don't wait to move up in levels, rather, I could do each level so that I am not doing the same workout again and again.  THANK YOU to that person.  I am now switching around levels and I love it.  Level 2 and 3 are harder but I follow the \\"easier\\" version of most of the exercises and make modifications to some of the aerobic exercises that may be too hard (or that I just may not like).  This is now my favorite DVD.  I love it because it is hard enough to actually replace the gym... and in only 25 min.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I never cared much for slipknot untill I heard this album, eventhough I had seen them in concert on their first album. This one won me over big time. The song 'Duelaltity' got me hooked and sucked me into all the other great songs on this one. A must have for any metal head!
B00127R7JM|5.0|Some said that the Adversary was a kind of Mercyful Fate meets Emperor, although in my view it was more of Judas Priest (Sad wings ... era) meets Emperor with King Diamond falsettos.  On here, one can say that is Opeth meets Emperor, and the presence of Mikael Akerfeldt on the song Unhealer will not deny this assertion.  Adding some weird Alice in Chains impressions that I will not examine any further because it is just me.  Now enters the music itself.  The first track Misanthrope is quite reminiscent of Invocation (first track on The Adversary) as this one was of Curse You All Men, like if Ihsahn was trying to tell us, hey, it's me again as an introduction.  But, Misanthrope is not as ardent as was Invocation, and not as triumphant as Curse You All Men.  Misanthrope is more on the brooding side of things, more desperate also, underlined by a vindictive undertone, I would say in a much more darker mood than on The Adversary.  And that's what will come out from the full opus as a feeling.      Scarab follows, this one in my ears and perception, being the most epic track of the album.  While groovy, heavy and proggy, the piano interlude where Ihsahn lays very tasty clean vocals is followed by a symphonic bridge in a true Ihsahnesque fashion. Very good song.  And then Unhealer begins, in a melancholic way, strengthens by Mikael Akerfeldt's angelic voice, then the melancholy leaves to let the chorus spread its menacing tension where Akerfeldt growls and Ihsahn screams.  Oddly the song ends with a fade out, which is rare in Ihsahn way of making music.  Haunting track.  Follows Emancipation, the catchy song, but not in a way one could expect from Ihsahn.  It has jazzy verses and some sort of a death/doom chorus, while being still very much progressive.  Kind of a earworm for me.  Malediction, as Misanthrope has a more Black Metal taste, keyboards are more in front than it was on The Adversary, and it's also much more layered than the Black Metal scented ones of the latter.      Alchemist is a strange one.  Progressive embroidered on a power metal canvas, but torn by unexpected song structure.  Ihsahn's clean voice recalling a sort of paranoid feeling, and then strangling itself in his trademark screams. The guitar solo being tortured and enjoyable, the whole leaving the listener quite a bit clueless about what he's just been listened.  And following this state of mind, the descending Elevator, the masterpiece of the whole album in my opinion.  Have I talk about brooding, despair, dark mood and paranoia?  You have them all on this one, but musically, what an interesting song, with its descending riff, and that choked, horrifying scream \\"And the devil takes me down\\" willing to cling on the high guitar notes, but seeming unable to succeed.  This part is very evocative of the whole ambiance.  And then the more mellow part where Ihsahn sings cleanly keeps haunting, like a feeling of resignation toward his destiny.  Leaving the listener in a dehydration state.  Arrives Threnody with acoustic guitars to quench our thirst.  Another odd piece of work of a kind never heard before from the man.  A melancholic ballad, evoking his eternal inspirational source, the same one as on the ballad Astera Ton Proinon from the Adversary, but it's a totally different ballad, this time.  Acoustic guitar, naked clean vocal, displayed in an unpredictable way and wrapped in the same deeply dark mood of angL, Threnody says it all.      The opus ends with Monolith, starting with a proggy mellow groove to turn into another Black Metal reminiscent days of glory, soon tamed by the feeling that is one of angL, would I say despair?  All in all, angL flourishes from plenty of weird deconstructed technical guitar solo and riffs, tasteful clean vocals by all the singers involved, keyboards and orchestral injection are more on the front, unifying the somewhat diabolical thread line, and the rhythm part is supplied by fretless bass lines adding a solid texture to this work of art, as for the drumming foundation.  angL is more layered than The Adversary  and benefits from a thicker and deeper production.  On the lyrical side, we cope with Nietzschean themes (Misanthrope, Emancipation) as well as Goethe's Faust (Alchemist and Elevator) influences, his traditional struggling and alienation of being of mortal essence (Scarab), the prominence of the fallen one theme (Threnody).  I will not compare the two opus other than what I've already done.  If in my perception, The Adversary was an exuberant, angered, romantic and passionate album, angL is a  desperate, resigned at once as vindictive, sad and pitiless one.  Possibly the opus where Ihsahn lays his best vocals performance, guitar playing and songwriting.  Another masterpiece by the man, who's continuing to explore every dark corner of his heart and soul.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I have a 9 year old and a 6 year old and they both love to play this game.  It teaches strategy and requires the players to think about what their next move is at each stage of the game.  Some games when it isn't the players turn can't hold the kids attention because they role a dice and go a few places or pull a card and do what it says.  This game requires the player to always pay attention and think about their next move.  We have had so much fun we bought it for 2 other kids and they both love it as well.

1583762027|5.0|I picked up \\"Eat that Frog!\\" on a whim, thinking it would be a fair addition to my motivational book library.  I was surprised to find that, although a quick and easy-to-digest read, it contained more information and direction than many other books on the same topic.  I found myself taking a few notes and instantly incorporating the practices it outlines into my daily routine, upping my effectiveness and giving me a much needed push!  If you're in need of some anti-procrastination direction, \\"Eat that Frog!\\" is the first (and maybe only) place to begin!

067003830X|3.0|This is a book that my men's book club enjoyed. I also enjoyed the book, but found the author to be a bit of true believer - if what he claims is true most every case of autism, paralysis, tinitis, and other neurological disorders can be fixed by taking advantage of the new understanding that the brain can create new routes and perhaps new nerves. The range of impact of this approach is staggering and will have implications for many years to come. The topics covered include sexual attraction, social skills, 'itches' of amputated limbs, fetishism, spatial reasoning, stroke recovery, feelings from phantom limbs, pain of phantom limbs, pornography addiction, cognitive decline, OCD, and even blindness. As you can tell, I found the information of various cases exciting and offering great promise, but I also found the lack of a balanced presentation by the author to be disconcerting.
B000002GJH|4.0|Although numerous journalists, reviewers and aficionados have a penchant for dubbing Temple of the Dog the finest album that either Chris Cornell or Eddie Vedder have ever worked on, there lies an element of misguided truth in all the bluster.<br /><br />Temple of the Dog is not a difficult album to love. It showcases much of what is great about the musicians involved (Soundgarden's singer Cornell and drummer Matt Cameron; and Pearl Jam's guitarist Stone Gossard, bassist Jeff Ament, lead guitarist Mike McCready and singer Vedder), and perhaps that which is unfortunately conspicuous by its absence or under-use in each band's catalogue.<br /><br />The album is a requiem of sorts to Andy Wood - former roommate of Cornell and frontman for Mother Love Bone, of which Gossard and Ament were both members. Wood's death of a heroin overdose on the eve of the release of MLB's much-vaunted debut album Apple in 1990, is seen as something of a watershed moment for the burgeoning Seattle scene - the loss of an illusory innocence for the scene itself, a wake-up call for some (and sadly not others), and precipitating the birth of Pearl Jam.<br /><br />The opening two tracks, `Say Hello 2 Heaven' and the epic `Reach Down' are the two that most apparently recall Wood in both a sensitive and luminous light, with the latter giving Mike McCready free-reign to solo for over 4 minutes continuously in what was effectively his debut professional recording. Similarly, `Hunger Strike' gave Vedder his debut lead vocal recording, combining with Cornell in a duet of two of their generation's finest and most distinctive voices.<br /><br />Stylistically, the album sails closer to the MLB psychedelic/funk/glam-metal than any Soundgarden or Pearl Jam record has and is a refreshing counterpoint to each band's signature sound. The album is not an ode to Wood per se - with Cornell discoursing on many subjects found in his Soundgarden lyrics: the natural world and encroaching modernity and industrialisation (`Pushin Forward Back'), social inequality (the hit `Hunger Strike') and Christian evangelism (`Wooden Jesus') alongside tracks that are obliquely about Wood (`Call Me A Dog' and `Times of Trouble'), with Cornell's most graceful and sophisticated ballad (`All Night Thing') closing the proceedings.<br /><br />Temple of the Dog is an album and a project however, that prospered as a result of circumstance and timing. Had Pearl Jam's debut `Ten' already have been released when this album was conceived, the impression is that it would not have been anywhere near as good. As such, Temple is a collaborative effort guided by Cornell's vision and NOT a supergroup as some would posit - there were no particular time restraints or pressures placed on the musicians; no egos to be kept in check and most importantly no subconscious attempts to out-manoeuvre each other. As Ament concludes in the liner notes, \\"no analyzing. No pressure. No hype. Just music to make music. Friends and a reason.\\"ial inequality (the hit `Hunger Strike') and Christian evangelism (`Wooden Jesus') alongside tracks that are obliquely about Wood (`Call Me A Dog' and `Times of Trouble'), with Cornell's most graceful and sophisticated ballad (`All Night Thing') closing the proceedings.

As such, Temple is a collaborative effort guided by Cornell's vision and NOT a supergroup as some would posit - there were no particular time restraints or pressures placed on the musicians; no egos to be kept in check and most importantly no subconscious attempts to out-manoeuvre each other. As Ament concludes in the liner notes, \\"no analyzing. No pressure. No hype. Just music to make music. Friends and a reason.\\"
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This dvd collection is an amazing buy for any Alien enthusiest. If you enjoyed any movie in the collection I am sure you will find the rest of the series just as entertaining. The bonus footage is amazing along with the hows and the whens you get extra movie length. You will sure notice a change in the quality of the movie with the extra footage. I did not think the movies could get any better but I was wrong.

B00005JPNZ|2.0|Contrary to what Mr. Spielberg thinks, there is no real McGuffin--the Crystal Skull really doesn't do it--and that's just one of the many drawbacks of the new Indy film. Furthermore, it's marred by overstuffed action sequences and Indy's lame one-liners which becomes obvious during the first ten minutes. The story stumbles so badly in the first half-hour that you can't help wondering how bad the final result will be.<br /><br />Early in the film, when HARRISON FORD's usually witty one-liners come across as lame and lifeless (as well as few and far between); and later,  when John Williams' music over the end credits is the only thrilling moment you've really had, you know your expectations were never met. This Indy movie tries hard to approximate what went before--and even brings KAREN ALLEN back for a few laughs--but the story is a dismal thing about the desperate search for a Crystal Skull that gives the possessor all the knowledge he'll ever need. Somehow, it fails the McGuffin test that Steven Spielberg thinks he solved. The goal is never well defined.<br /><br />And yet, the world has such a hunger for another Indiana Jones movie that it's cleaning up at the box-office no matter how negative any of the reviews are. I wanted to like it because I miss a good Indiana Jones story as much as anyone--but this isn't it.<br /><br />CATE BLANCHETT remains one-dimensional throughout, although her make-up is good and she looks the part of a Russian adventuress. SHIA LaBEOUF, in his black leather jacket, looks like he stepped out of a James Dean movie but never quite fits into this one. He and Ford have some good byplay but it's all so pat. And then we have JOHN HURT wearing a wild-eyed stare and the year's messiest male hairdo in what might have been an interesting role if we could figure out what he's all about.<br /><br />HARRISON FORD is still afraid of snakes and there's a bonus scene where he has to hang onto one if he wants to get out of quicksand, but other than a few reminders of the Indy of past films, he looks a bit hardened and tired, lacking the zestful playfulness that characterized his earlier way with the part. The script makes concessions to his age, especially from him, to make sure we get the point.<br /><br />Of course, he's not entirely to blame. It's an impossible comic book sort of story that needed a lot of re-working before they decided to go ahead and film it as is. All the story really does is serve as a sort of map on which to plant all the familiar action clich&eacute;s--explosives, rapid machine-gunning, wild chases through the jungle, man-eating ants, waterfalls that fill the screen from one end to another, and comic book villains that survive every punch with little more than a flinch as Indy swings at them from every direction while he remains relatively unscathed even without using his whip. Despite the strongly realistic sound those punches make, nobody suffers a broken jaw--just minor bruises.<br /><br />The chase scene at the end is almost numbing in its wildly overdone mishaps. There's no satisfaction to be had at the end except for the wind-up that has him tying the knot with Marian Ravenwood after all these years. That and the brilliant but familiar John Williams score that sounds wonderful over the end credits without all the explosive action drowning it out.<br /><br />Better luck next time, Mr. Spielberg. And a better McGuffin. You can cry all the way to the box-office gold.films, he looks a bit hardened and tired, lacking the zestful playfulness that characterized his earlier way with the part.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|I saw Jaws when it debuted in 1975 and we were late getting in because of parking issues; however, we made it to the interior and couldn't see to find a seat having just come out of sunlight into dark so we waited and while we were waiting, the opening credits ran, accompanied by that MUSIC.<br />We stood there until the girl had her nighttime encounter with the shark and our knees turned to rubber (sorry, buit the cliche fits) and were thankful when the scene changed to daylight and we could grope our way to our seats.<br />The audience was blown away as were we, and the biggest shocker came when Hooper (Dreyfuss) is taking the tooth off Ben Gardner's boat and that HEAD comes out; everyone shot out of their chairs and screamed; it was and is a truly shocking moment, We are expecting the shark to come from behind Dreyfuss, not for something to pop out of the BOAT so this was brilliant (TY SSpielberg)and the actors are all so good. LOVE Robert Shaw, but as Quint he excels himself and turns in a great performance, esp the relating of the story of the USS Indianapolis. I had never heard of it before and subsuquent research was not only enlightening, it was appalling.<br />Roy Scheider was solid as Brody, a vastly different interpretation from that in the book, thankfully, and Lorraine Gary was wonderful as Mrs Brody.<br />The quality is superb, better than I've ever seen, but the real value here is the extras, notably the Making of, which is the best I have ever seen on any disc of any moive; this was almost as riveting as the movie itself. It is quite lengthy and provides many fascinating factoids and gives a new light and dimension to the movie. HIGHLY recommend.<br />God Bless and RIP Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw, and TY for so many excellent performances.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Let me count the ways:  1. Characters no one cares about  2. A monster from nowhere, going nowhere, doing nothing  3. A narrator with absolutely nothing interesting to say  4. Events no one understands and no one ever explains  5. A story with no beginning, no ending and no point  6. A video technique that inspires nothing but nausea  7. 84 minutes of film intended as entertainment but achieving nothing but boredom and confusion    The result is Melrose Place meets Godzilla and Godzilla loses.  The insult to the injury of this mega-dud is that it was made by the guy now holding the future of the Star Trek franchise in his non-stabilized hands.      Don't waste your time!
B000QXDED6|2.0|300 is like a giant, goofy video game, with silly history and far too much CGI for one motion picture.  It feels like a giant comic book, which, I guess, was what it was supposed to be.  Visual and shallow.<br /><br />The film starts out interesting enough with the rough warrior childhood details, then veers into some silliness with religious elders (who, in accordance with traditional Hollywood perception of religion, are all corrupt perverts), then gets into non-stop battle footage, with occasional lapses back to a disinteresting sub-plot in Sparta.<br />The battle footage looks like non-stop video game cutscenes (and even the 300 video game, advertised at the beginning of the dvd, looked like scenes taken from the film.)<br />The spartan warriors seem more like WWE stars that ancient warlords (are they wearing tights and a cape?)<br />Just silly.  Watchable, but silly.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Santana *****<br /><br />Fresh off the success of their stint at the historic Woodstock, Santana, the last of the San Francisco bands to emerge at the end of the 1960's recorded this, their fantastic self-titled debut album. Over the years Santana would have brilliance in his albums, much like Blues For Salvador which would be amazing had it not been for the production, or Supernatural which jump started his career again but was a lack luster album. Well this was not the case with the first four Santana albums, especially this one, as it is truly the groups best.<br /><br />Featuring the talented Gregg Rolie on the keys/organ and on most of the vocals. Many can take or leave his vocals and lyrics while I love them. 'Shades Of Time' can be pretentious at times, especially the title, but overall it is a good instrumental track with some good vocals. 'Persuasion' and 'You Just Don't Care' can be summed the same. 'Evil Ways' while it was the big hit on the album, really has never been heard until you've heard it in album form. And while it is a cover, the group makes it their own.<br /><br />But for me what makes Santana the groups best effort is the instrumental factor. The over all instrumentation on the album is more or less breathtaking. 'Treat' is melt in your mouth good, and 'Waiting' sets the pace for what the band would do in the next decade. 'Savor' is almost haunting the way Carlos' guitar and Rolies organ intertwined. 'Jingo' reminds me why I play the guitar every time I hear it, and 'Soul Sacrifice' could speak for itself but I must say that it is with out competition the very best thing the group ever recorded. It is a testament to what made early Santana records so great, the fact that they could cram an amazing jam into a short few minutes.<br /><br />Santana brought something new to the table with their blending of jazz, rock, African, Spanish, and blues to make one of the most original sounds in all of rock. Mike Shrieve would go down as one of rocks most underrated drummers as would the percussion section of Jose Areas and Mike Carabello.<br /><br />Santana is one of those rare rock albums that is not just a mere rock album, but more of a solid piece of music playing out as one long, never boring piece of music with many parts, much like Miles Davis' Porgy And Bess.<br /><br />With some versions of Santana three bonus tracks are included from their set at Woodstock. A fiery run at 'Savor,' and maybe the most breathtaking version of 'Soul Sacrifice' you'll ever hear, as well as a semi-rare 'Fried Neckbones' which is always a good listen. With or without the bonus tracks, Santana's debut album is a must have for an musical collection.the percussion section of Jose Areas and Mike Carabello.

006056251X|4.0|Shy, stuttering Wallflower, Evangeline Jenner is threatened by her over-powering relations.  They want to keep her fortune in the family (her disreputable father is dying and he owns a successful gambling house) by marrying her to her weak and disgusting cousin.  So she escapes and runs to the notorious rake, Sebastian, Viscount St. Vincent, with a proposition.  Sebastian has recently unsuccessfully tried to kidnap and marry an heiress, one of Evangeline's fellow Wallflowers, in order to stay solvent.  Although he's heir to a Dukedom, his father is a spend-thrift and money is short.  Ordinarily, the gorgeous viscount would never look twice at the retiring, virginal Evie, but her proposal is too good to pass up, and--taking that second look-- Evie is actually more interesting than he believed...<br /><br />Evie is young and inexperienced, but she's got more of a back-bone than it seems from her usual behavior.  Her father is dying and she wants to see him and nothing will stand in her way.  She's also very aware of what may be the downside of marrying Sebastian.  Sebastian has a lot to atone for after kidnapping Evie's friend--who was the fiancee of his best friend, Lord Westcliff.  He also admits freely that his is not husband-material.  But although he is an admitted rake, he also has some honor and he treats Evie surprisingly gently.<br /><br />I liked that neither were out to seduce each other.  Of course, other things concerned them along the way--rushing to Gretna Green and then heading back to London to see Evie's father, keeping her from her nasty relatives, and reviving the gambling house...  It was also nice that although both Evie's and Sebastian's pasts had their dark sides that affected them both, they weren't horribly tortured, angst-ridden people.<br /><br />This was a very satisfying and enjoyable Reformed Rake tale, with a lovely main couple, a good cast of secondary characters and a decent plot.  The historical detail was lacking in parts, but nice in others; I particularly loved the Gretna Green wedding.

B000YIGNKE|2.0|*Some spoilers follow. You don't have to be an Austen \\"purist\\" to be disgusted at the end of this movie. And it was only so-so up until that. I love Jane Austen so much that I'm pretty forgiving with directors changing things here and there from the book, etc. if it works in the Austen spirit of things. (I thought the quirky \\"Mansfield Park\\" with Frances O'Connor was charming.) But THIS movie is bad using any criteria- the women were miscast, the acting was completely off for the characters, and the ending- let's just say it was atrocious beyond description.   Am I the only one to fail to see why this handsome Wentworth would see anything in this dowdy, incessantly-hyperventilating Anne? No chemistry here whatsoever, and rightly so. Her sister Elizabeth looked old enough to be Sir Walter's wife, and Mary was never meant to be portrayed as an arguably likable character. And I will reiterate others' conclusion that this was the absolute worst on-screen kiss in the history of film. Terrible! And Kellynch was entailed away from the female line, as I recall, and being inherited by William Elliot - wasn't it impossible to break these inheritances by outside purchase? Anyway, this movie just doesn't work. Sally Hawkins as Anne just doesn't work. The '95 version with Amanda Root has its flaws but it is far superior to this, and a very satisfying adaptation. By all means watch that instead!

0446402389|5.0|TOM ROB SMITH, remember his name, because hopefully we should see a lot more from him in the future!     This, his first book, is what a well-read reader would expect from a very seasoned, very prolific writer whether their preferred genre is murder mysteries or historical novels. With Tom Rob Smith you get both in one!    First, let me explain that I am not a mystery fan (historical fiction is my preference) like my wife who cannot wait for next book of Thomas Harris or Patricia Cornwell or John Sandford or James Patterson or Iris Johansen... well you get the point.     One should be warned that Tom Rob Smith does take his time to fully develop his characters and though it takes roughly the first third to do this it is most certainly worth the plot delay.     Child 44 begins in 1933 in a cold, bleak, wretched Russian village then quickly leaps to the `current time' of the novel in 1953 still under Stalin's reign of fear. All during this time the author is both developing his main characters as well as giving one a sense of the paranoia and fear that gripes every Soviet civilian.    Leo, the focal character of the book evolves from a dutiful employee of the state security force to one with a dangerous obsession of tracking down a killer that the state does not acknowledge as existing. He must pursue the killer without drawing attention to his efforts or he could be sent to a gulag or worse.  The Soviet Union did not condone freethinking, initiative and even compassion, which is why not only Leo stays in danger but also from all those he solicits help.     This book works on some many levels that it is bound to keep one engaged throughout the book.     P. S. In all of my forty-four adult years of reading I have never written nor have I ever been compelled to write a book review. Tom Rob Smith has changed that!
B000NA2776|4.0|If you are in the mood for something fun, flirty and deliciously campy, make sure you pick up Mika's debut album \\"Life in Cartoon Motion\\". It is a collection of up-tempo songs and mellow ballads that will probably have you raising an eyebrow at first, and then dancing your heart out by the end.<br />Mika has a very strange voice - it's quite, well, manly when he sings in a normal manner, but he often ventures into the world of falsetto, and believe me, his falsetto would even make James Blunt jealous.<br />\\"Life in Cartoon Motion\\" opens with \\"Grace Kelly\\", one of many chart-toppers off this album. It is an incredibly fun and silly song about Mika's troubles getting signed under a label. It is a great album opener too, since it is a perfect showcase of what is in store for us. It has heart, it features well-sung vocals from Mika, and also features his trademark naughtiness (\\"Should I bend over, should I look older just to be put on your shelf?\\"). Mika, you old dog.<br />\\"Lollipop\\" continues in the same manner, until \\"My Interpretation\\" kicks in - it is the first ballad, with great melody and wonderful, well, interpretation.<br />Next come another two amazing chart toppers, \\"Love Today\\" and the unbelievably simplistic, yet effective \\"Relax (Take It Easy)\\". If you finally decide not to buy this album, make sure you at least get an mp3 version of this track - it is flawless. It is followed by another great track, \\"Ring Ring\\", which is one of my personal favorites.<br />\\"Any Another World\\" is probably the weakest track on the album, its undefined slow melody failing to strike a chord with the audience. Next, there is the musical theatre-like track, \\"Billy Brown\\", just as passable as the previous one. But then Mika compensates with the ridiculous \\"Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)\\", a track you can't help but shake your butt to, no matter how big or small it is. The last two tracks, \\"Stuck In The Middle\\" and \\"Happy Ending\\" (reminiscent of Madonna's \\"Nothing Fails) gradually slow down the pace and end the album.<br />Although Mika's debut is by no means flawless, it is definitely an album to buy - a living proof that one doesn't have to succumb to generic pop in order to be a sensation.end the album.

0143038419|1.0|I too was seduced by the great reviews...and now I can only issue a warning...DON'T BUY THIS!   The author comes across as immature and self-absorbed.  She lost me at Italy, but I skimmed India and Indonesia.   Bottom line:  Look elsewhere for a good spiritual read. I'd give zero stars if I could.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|yeah like i said i hate rap hip hop and all that crap but slipknot doesn't even sound nu metal especially in iowa that's just a plain metal album except in their first album which was stupid rap metal,but in iowa and vol 3 just a few scratches and that's it no rapping really.But what i don't like about this album is that corey's screams are gone,they're okay in this one just not as \\"brutal\\" than in iowa or even in their first album but i hope they come back in the new album.So get this one the first time i heard slipknot was in this album and i just taught it was just a \\"heavy\\" metal album no \\"nu metal\\" but you're the judge.You will enjoy this album the song before i forget is great they say it's a metalcore song but i don't know why its not brutal or something,the closest you can called them heavy or brutal is in iowa,also i heard their new album will be heavy as f**k that sounds cool and for this album get it,it's just like a heavier stone sour with some industrial sounds and CAN'T WAIT FOR THEIR NEW ALBUM THESE GUYS WERE INFLUENCED ALOT BY DEATH METAL SO I HOPE WILL SEE THAT STUFF YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000VSBX34|5.0|I had purchased this movie a while back, and have never gotten the chance to watch it.   I should have seen it when I bought it-I was missing out!    I had previously watched \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", and \\"Help!\\" beats it out of the park. Not to take anything away from \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", but I just thought this was more entertaining.    This movie is extremely silly and hilarious, while still keeping the plot, and surprisingly, keeps the story-line moving, all the way to the end.    This movie made me laugh all the way through, while at the same time, I got to enjoy the songs that were on the \\"Help!\\" CD. The attempts to get Ringo's ring made me laugh the most during the film.     \\"Help!\\" is a great movie for anybody who is a beatles fan, old-time movie fan, or just want a good laugh. I'd highly recommend this movie, and plan to watch it again very soon.

1573223026|5.0|I am a massive Hornby fan.  I read all of his books, all of them are very enjoyable but this one tied the first place with High Fidelity.  Personally, I love the way he used 4 main charactors to narrate one after another, it's a great way to alternate my own experience through the book.  We have 1 middle-age man, 1 angry teenager, 1 conservative lady, and 1 young punk(not punk-as-in-punk-music).  And I love them all!  The plot is great too.  They all met because they all one way or another found eachother on the rooftop while comtemplating jumping off it.      I do have to see that it's not funny in an American way, it is a dark-funny British story that you have to love their dark humor to get it.  Be open-minded and read it, satisfaction guaranteed!!    ***The worst of his book is Slam which is really for young adults but I read it anyway, it is ok but certainly his worst.  Fever pitch is great, awesome for me because I am an Arsenal (English FOOTBALL team - real Football play by using your FEET) fan so (OH and the movie adaptation of this book is a TOTAL TOTAL TOTAL CRAP, why would they use it as a base at all is beyond me).

B000XGDO04|5.0|Adele absolutely shines on this CD.  Her voice is truly mesmerizing.  My favorites are Cold Shoulder, Tired, Chasing Pavements, Right as Rain, My Same and Home Glory.  This CD is worth every penny.  Move over Amy Winehouse, here comes a bit of class that's sure to be around for a long time.  I think some of the reviewers here who don't think she stands up to Amy Winehouse are way off the mark.  There's no way you can listen to the above-mentioned songs and not think that Adele smokes Amy Winehouse.  This is music you can listen to over and over and not get tired of it.  As for the reviewer who wishes Adele looked more like Shakira, I have your cure:  Play a Baywatch DVD with the sound on mute and instead have Adele's music for background.  The rest of us are content with both her looks and outstanding music.

Every scene has some form of annoying music which changes in an ad hoc fashion. There is no need for it and in the end cheapens the movie - I could not wait for it to end - it irritated me so much Such a pity - two good actor messed up by the sound effects people. I felt so relieved in the few parts that had no artificial background noise.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|(The review below is what I wrote after seeing the film for the first time.  Since then, I've seen it again and I have to say...it plays better a second time.  I think 20 years of anticipation really stokes up the expectations so high that no film can live up to it.  And this one didn't, at first.  Having already seen it once, I have to say that I could sit back and really enjoy it better the second time.  Weird).<br /><br />I'm sure opinions are going to be all over the place for this movie--it made over $300 million worldwide its first weekend so obviously a lot of people saw it!<br /><br />I saw it with a midnight movie crowd the night before it was supposed to open and most of the crowd were high school kids and two guys dressed as Indy.  There was no applause at the end and everyone shuffled out.<br /><br />Something seemed missing.<br /><br />They certainly threw enough onto the screen.  The opening sequence in Nevada set a good pace as a team of Soviet spies use a kidnapped Indy to storm Area 51 and retrieve an other-worldly artifact from the warehouse we last saw at the end of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The shot of Indiana Jones' silhouette walking up a hill as an atomic mushroom cloud fills the desert sky shows us the world has certainly changed since our hero battled Nazis all over the world.<br /><br />But the fun energy of the first film was missing.  It just wasn't fun after that.  And I don't mean that the filmmakers should've gone for cheap laughs or even ridiculous camp...but that spontaneous thrill from RAIDERS was gone.  It was never in TEMPLE OF DOOM and there were flashes in LAST CRUSADE.<br /><br />Although the whole extraterrestial angle was new and different, there were too many elements too closely tied to the earlier films.  There's no getting away from lost cities in jungles because, well, this is an Indiana Jones movie, but the finale felt like a rehash of RAIDERS.  The Ark of the Covenant was sufficiently explained so everyone could follow that ending.  But this time?  I'm guessing I know what happened and why, but did anyone lose count of how many crystal skulls were in play here?  The Russians nabbed one in Nevada and Indy got one in South America...but there was only one missing from the El Dorado temple, right?<br /><br />I also didn't care for the young guy character, Mutt.  He didn't look like James Dean or Marlon Brando, he looked like Screech from \\"Saved by the Bell\\" dressed up like Marlon Brando.  And his instant transformation from 50s punk to vine-swinging Tarzan nearly derailed the whole movie (I suspect that terrible CGI shot of him swinging with the CGI monkeys was only included in the latest round of ads is meant to take the sting of incredulous laughs from otherwise unsuspecting moviegoers).<br /><br />Very cool to see Karen Allen back.  (Now if we can only find out what happened to her character in ANIMAL HOUSE....)<br /><br />I remember reading how Spielberg assured everyone that the action wouldn't rely on computer special effects...but it looked like a LOT of computer special effects were used anyway, a real momentum killer for me anymore.  Most of the thrill of stuntwork was always the stunned belief that SOMEONE REALLY JUST DID THAT!  Until computers can trick us better, it's going to be hard to get us as excited as we used to be in movies.<br /><br />Some of the special effects shots were great though.  Since it's Spielberg and Lucas, you know you're seeing the best that money can buy.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't as bitterly disappointed as a lot of people were but I wasn't as excited and blown away as I was when I saw RAIDERS in the summer of 1981.  We were all a lot younger then.  And I can't blame this new production for trying.<br /><br />I'd rank them this way: TEMPLE OF DOOM was the worst, hands down.  Then this one.  Then LAST CRUSADE.  And still way out ahead, safely sitting way up on top is RAIDERS.know what happened and why, but did anyone lose count of how many crystal skulls were in play here?

Very cool to see Karen Allen back.  (Now if we can only find out what happened to her character in ANIMAL HOUSE....)    I remember reading how Spielberg assured everyone that the action wouldn't rely on computer special effects...but it looked like a LOT of computer special effects were used anyway, a real momentum killer for me anymore.  Most of the thrill of stuntwork was always the stunned belief that SOMEONE REALLY JUST DID THAT!  Until computers can trick us better, it's going to be hard to get us as excited as we used to be in movies.    Some of the special effects shots were great though.  Since it's Spielberg and Lucas, you know you're seeing the best that money can buy.    Overall, I wasn't as bitterly disappointed as a lot of people were but I wasn't as excited and blown away as I was when I saw RAIDERS in the summer of 1981.  We were all a lot younger then.  And I can't blame this new production for trying.    I'd rank them this way: TEMPLE OF DOOM was the worst, hands down.  Then this one.  Then LAST CRUSADE.  And still way out ahead, safely sitting way up on top is RAIDERS.
0307277887|3.0|I never saw the TV series but I got the book just for fun. It's macabre, morbid, and in a very weird way, funny at the same time. If you live in Miami, or lived in Miami, the book has so many local references that it will make you feel you are there. Almost plausible that it could happen.<br />A very entertaining book.
B0010DRYSM|5.0|[[ASIN:B00009Y3L4 Cabaret]]   One of the best movie musicals ever! Worth all the 8 Oscars it received in 1972. Liza Minnelli, Michael Your and Joel Grey are unforgettable in this story of 1931 Berlin, when the Nazis were coming to power. You laugh, you cry, you fear for the worst... The music thrills you, shocks you, touches you... An experience of a life time. This movie never gets old- you'd think it was made yesterday. I strongly recommend- you will not regret!  Aulikki
B000ELJBAK|4.0|The eponymous solo debut by Pink Floyd's lead guitarist is an exceptional effort. Surprisingly, it doesn't sound very much like a Pink Floyd album. It managed to get to #29 on the charts. There weren't any singles that penetrated Billboard's Top 200 but how often did Pink Floyd do that?    The album opens with the instrumental \\"Mihalis\\" which is one of the best songs on here. \\"There's No Way Out of Here\\" was written by a friend of his. This song, at least in the area I live in, was the most played song on the radio from this album. This is the best song on the album. It has good lyrics, a catchy melody & a distinctive harmonica. \\"Cry from the Street\\" is also a very good song. \\"So Far Away\\" is a piano based slow song that's the weakest song on the album. \\"Short and Sweet\\" sounds as if it could be a Pink Floyd effort. \\"Raise My Rent\\" is an instrumental that also could have been a Pink Floyd song; it also has one of Gilmour's trademark leads. \\"No Way\\" is another very good song  with another trademark lead. \\"Deafinitely\\" is another instrumental & is only an average song, Gilmour does one of those odd sounding leads on this one. \\"I Can't Breathe Anymore\\" closes out the disc. Has anyone else ever noticed how often Gilmour songs have a reference to breathing? It starts off slow then builds up to some crushing rhythm & leads by Gilmour.    This is Gilmour's most consistent effort. It sounds more like Pink Floyd than his two other solo efforts. The remastering by Columbia/Legacy is excellent. The booklet provides no information but there are some photos, some of them appear to have been taken while he was very young, high school perhaps. Apparently David Gilmour, Rick Wills & Willie Wilson must have played together when they were young; some of the photos show them playing together live when they were younger. Rick Wills (bass & vocals) would later become the bassist for Foreigner beginning with Head Games. Interestingly, Wills was also a co-composer of Frampton's \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\".
0670018651|5.0|Two months ago I had zero background or interest in perfume.  A recent New Yorker review peaked my interest, and I am hooked!  Sanchez and Turin are witty, likable, informed, and fabulously entertaining critics, and I feel I have been given an unexpected gift to enjoy for the rest of my life - the beginning of an educated appreciation of perfume.  For example, based on one of their recommendations, I got a good deal on eBay for a bottle of Black (Bulgari) and it arrived today. Over the last few hours, I was able to experience it's complexity with an educated nose - it was an awakening to be able to appreciate this magnificant scent and to have some insight into its nature. I can't remember a book I have enjoyed more.  I do have two recommendations for the future editions that will surely be published.  One is that I would love for the glossary to be bit more complete.  Also, the Top Ten Lists (I loved those), and the Index of Star Ratings were great, but additionally, a cross-referenced index would be very useful. There were many perfumes, ingredients, perfumers, etc., that were discussed in multiple places, and it would be fun to more easily explore those topics using an index.  Enjoy!!
B0013ND30M|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is my favorite Disney movie of all. It's the first Disney movie we get to see the prince actually doing something. It's absolutely beautiful, and I will get this DVD, although I now have the previously released 2-disc set.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|This movie wasn't awful, but it definitely was not as good as it could be. The actress was very wonderful, she did an excellent job of portraying Ann Elliott. The actor opposite her was nice to look at, but his performance is a little weak. The story is true to Jane Austen's story, so that is a plus.      Now, for the problem. This movie was too short! There were many scenes that seemed rushed and incomplete. The part of the story there is is good, but there was some important scenes left out and some things were in the wrong order. For example, at the end of the story, Ann and Wentworth's friend, Bennet, are supposed to have a conversation about the constencey of men vs. women. It is while listening to this conversation that Wentworth writes the letter informing Ann that he has never stopped loving her. However, in the movie the conversation happens much earlier and Wentworth's letter comes as a result of hearing Ann is not engaged to Mr. Elliott. I think that the movie was done this way to save time, but it does kind of mess up the story.    Overall, this movie is OK, mainly because of the acting. However, it is too short and not great. It's a good alternative, but I would stick with the 1995 version with Amanda Root.
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|3 1/2 stars  This review is about the product, not the movie. We all love the movie.    I was concerned when I went to the store to pick up this DVD and saw that it was  a 1-disc \\"Special\\" Edition. It was always announced as a 2-disc Special Edition DVD. We saw it in sneak peeks in various Disney DVDs as in the DVD booklets. I loved how the \\"First Time Ever on 2-disc DVD\\" phrase was put so big in them. I did buy it, when it was lowered to $15 at Kmart, but I was very confused we didn't get the promised 2-disc edition, just a 1-disc, beautiful-looking DVD.
0131177052|5.0|If your job is working with Legacy Code, then you need to pick up this book.   If you follow his line of reasoning, you can pick up solid habits to systematically revitalize legacy code.  The main emphasis of the book is applying unit testing to legacy code for in the authors opinion, legacy code is simply \\"code without unit tests.\\"  You may or may not agree with this statement, but the techniques he presents to find \\"seams\\" as he calls them in the code to allow you to break dependencies are vital to working with legacy code even if you choose not to apply unit testing to your projects.  Some developers may attack the simplicity of the examples presented, saying they don't represent real-world examples, but if you \\"read\\" the text accompanying them you learn the techniques to tackle legacy code issues. Although I noted many publishing glitches - places where sentences to entire paragraphs are repeated from one page to another, the content is solid.
0595440096|5.0|Life hands us surprises, and Alice and her family receive a devastating one.  When Alice is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers, the entire family, as well as colleagues and friends, are affected.  Like any crisis, there are positive as well as negative outcomes.  Just think about it:  you are at the pinnacle of your career, and you know that your mind will deteriorate quickly--anyone's nightmare.      What I was so impressed with was Lisa Genova's understanding of what it means to be in a long-term and loving marriage, and how adult children wrestle with the impending loss of their mother's mind and memories of them.  That must be heart-breaking at any age.  Alice's husband, John, is endearing and frustrating as he tries to deal with his wife's disease.    I enjoy selling this book at Where the Sidewalk Ends Bookstore because it's intelligent, educational, and thoughtful. I had no idea that this disease could strike at a \\"young\\" age, in Alice's case 50 years young.   I found myself taking the \\"tests\\" along with Alice  and cheering Alice on when she prepares for the future Alice to commit suicide.  Without giving anything away, I was not prepared for the ending.  I will be making donations to the Alzheimers' Association (Ms. Genova does as well--$3.00 from every book).      Without a doubt, one of my top five books for this year.  There are so many incredible reads; make this one of yours.
B00005JNQA|4.0|The Interpreter was thought-provoking and challenging.  Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn were both great in the movie.

B0013XS8A2|3.0|I've heard this before, only when it was new and fresh and original back in the 70's. Not many artists, especially one of Oldfield's stature, can continue to make music of unending brilliance and creativity. Asking him to match his best work (TB, Hergest, Omma, Incantations, Platinum, etc.) 30 years out is probably not realistic. Every artist has a season when the work is strong and perfect and compelling. Oldfield has been repeating himself for quite some time now, and creating an \\"all-orchestral\\" work can't disguise the fact that Music of The Spheres is yet another version of Tubular Bells (listen to \\"Harbinger\\").    For my money, no popular artist has created work that approximates the grace of of a Bach concerto, except for Oldfield. No one has created largely instrumental music with such devastating emotional resonance. Oldfield created the genres of Ambient (before Eno) and New Age music and Classical Rock (if you're thinking Yes and Tull you're wrong). But that was some time ago. Some of the passages in Music of The Spheres are quite lovely: \\"Aurora\\" for one. But the creative engine that powered the early work is laboring and tired.     His earlier, long form works were focused with energy and inspiration and ideas. \\"Music of The Spheres\\" seems like an \\"average\\" of past work, a dash of TB and a shot of the ghastly \\"Voyager\\", warmed over and presented as a new work. As such, the emotional impact is minimal and my interest is therefore minmal.    In popular music there has been no one comparable to Oldfield (if Phillip Glass is a classical composer) and his stunning body of work, with the possible exception of Van Morrison during his \\"new age\\" period and maybe the Cocteau Twins. So I hope Oldfield continues to create new work. Maybe inspiration will strike again, but if not, there is his past catalogue to listen to. And that music is better than 99% of anything I've ever listened to.
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|A very hard album to get into, none of the instant gratification of the first 2 albums. Maybe a grower, time will tell. But if you're feeling a bit down, do not listen to this album !!!
B000002G8J|2.0|Not one of EC's best, the 1977 album, Slowhand is much stronger if one wants to hear some Clapton from this era.  Just One Night is also a better option as it contains several live versions of songs from Backless.
6305922756|3.0|I've finally seen this for the first time in 2008, and I'm 44 years old, making me a contemporary of Harry Shearer or something.  Wow, talk about being behind the times.<br /><br />There was no way this movie could live up to the hype.  No way any movie could live up to what I heard about this when it was new.  And a coworker gave away the best gag in the airport, which I'm not doing because I'm not such a spud.<br /><br />Anyway, I smiled a lot and chuckled a time or two.  I enjoyed the music, too, which was unexpected, really.  But mainly, I came away from this wishing that Spinal Tap was a real band, and that's a nice trick, don't you think?<br /><br />In short, this isn't \\"laugh out loud funny\\" as I was told over and over (and over) again, but it's certainly worth watching.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I am mixed. I want to say that his film stunk, but I also want to say that this film rocked. In general, I thought this was a great monster film, but I wish the film maker did not take the handheld/documentary approach. I believe that if this aspect of the film was removed we would have that incredible monster movie that the film makers were trying to go for.    Aside from this, the panic and mystery surrounding the monster was still done very well. I felt the reactions of the actors to what was going on was  as natural as such a fictitious story could get. That is, if there were actually such a monster plaguing the streets of Manhattan, I believe people would react similarly to the way they did in the film. The monster itself was awesome.  The acting was OK.     I have heard of a possible trilogy and I am excited for this.
B000YDOOU0|2.0|I am a Pat Metheny fanatic but, this CD was very disappointing.  I guess I am not use to him performing with other artisit.  The classic Pat for me is the Pat Metheny Group with Lyle Mays.
B000WCBPBO|1.0|like most of the other songs on this album... I want Sheryl Crow's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" in a BAD way, though not bad enough to buy the album... I guess I'll have to buy another version of this song elsewhere...
B00127RAJY|3.0|I really wanted to like this since it had such good reviews and I love the biggest loser.           My biggest problem was that it was really hard on my calfs.  I get cramps in my calfs and I could hardly make it through with out my calfs cramping up, and staying crampy all day.  Second is that I just cant get passed Jillian's attitude, it really is unappealing.    There were things I liked about the video, the moves were simple to do, not to dancy and I also liked the set and the two girls in the video were pleasant.
B000X418UE|5.0|At San Francisco in Alcatraz, a group of terrorists lead by ex-general Hummel (Ed Harris) who demand a ransom as they threaten to launch missles with deadly gas into the San Francisco bay area if they don't get what they want. FBI chemical warfare agent Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) now must join up with former criminal Mason (Sean Connery) to rescue the hostages and stop the madmen from threatening the city.<br /><br />Explosive and action packed thriller which is Michael Bay's crowning achievement besides \\"Transformers\\" delivers all the thrills and chills that anyone needs. Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson lavishly produced this movie and Michael Bay was just perfect to do this movie, the movie does co-star Tony Todd (\\"Candyman) and Michael Biehn. It's got excellent action sequences, terrific performances by the cast, humor, a little romance and a good plot makes this a sure fire crowdpleaser to any action lover out there.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray makes the movie never looked or sound this great before! the extras are phenomenal like a movie showcase spotlight that shows scenes that showcase the ultimate in HD pic and sound, Audio commentary, World Premier of the movie, featurettes, interviews, Trailers and TV Spots.
0307346617|5.0|this book is awesome. World War Z shows the massive amounts of research and time put into a novel, and i greatly appreciate the effort! Max Brooks has proven himself and is in my top 5.
0061122416|5.0|I'm not gonna talk about the book sorry, It's changed my life for one month, and forever like a human being, I used to read the newspaper when I went to my work by bus and subway all mornings and afternoons however when I began to read this book I teletransported myself to the place that the novel has  ocurred, were a magic moments every morning and afternoon I was happy because I knew that I had this book to read, I changed my way to see the life now I'm following the light and beginning to encourage myself in any sense in order to achieve my Personal Legend that I don´t want to talk about it. Anyways in my next vacation I´m going to Spain and travel the same trip that Santiago made.    Take care and peace

B0000VCZK2|5.0|Great product if you are die hard fan of the Alien series.  Shares alot of what was going on behind the scenes and includes some of the scenes that were not included in some of the releases you may see on premium tv channels. The first and second movies are my personal favorites but it's nice to have all four in a great collector's edition.

B000002UDB|4.0|Magical Mystrey Tour is a good album.  It is not as good as Sgt. Pepper, or some other albums of that time.  It does have some of the most innovative and original songs the Beatles had ever done.  What was unique was the way it was recorded. With the technology of the time they had to hire musicians from the London Symphony instead of simply programming keyboards as they do now.  You hear Cellos and violins along with trumpets and French horns.  There was no limit to the experimenting and the genuius of Lennon and McCartney. Tis is a prime example of the experimentation they had.  I remember hearing I am the walrus for the first time in 1967. It was so far from anything else I had ever heard it was not even funny.  Instead of Rock and Roll you get a lot of classical orchestration. Actually it is quite appealing to me.  The title song Magical Mystrey Tour was used to open Paul McCartney's World Tour, I have to admit it was a great way to open the concert.  All you need is Love is included and one of Lennons best.  Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields is included as well.  This is not the best album the Beatles have ever done, but it is worthy of a few listens and any Beatles collection....................
0743290119|3.0|Does Lauren have anything to offer readers?<br /><br />That is the question everyone should asked since her 2nd book was released. 2 be honest the Devil Wears Prada wasn't all that as the critics made it out to be. The only great thing was the title. It was clever & caught everyone's attention. If i was a person who never heard of the book & saw that book with that title as i passed by a book store & it was in the window display i would immediately run in & see what that book was all about. The title was catchy, i'll admit it. Anyways the book was ok, nothing great. I believe Andrea deserved everything negative that happened to her. All she did was whine & complain and nobody likes a complainer. When reading the book it made me realize how the character didn't even want to be there. How do you succeed in life if you can't even take the job you got hired to do, the job you applied for? (This all refers to The Devil Wears Prada)<br /><br />Anyways her 2nd book was trashed as it got a 2 star rating. I like the reviews on here because they are from the reader and not a paid critic. Now i was intrigued by her 3rd book because the title once again is catchy.<br /><br />I just finished reading the book and again i was sadly disappointed. Yes the author has made her way into pop culture mainstream because of the success of the DWP, but after a disappointing 1st & 2nd book i really thought that the 3rd time would be a charm. Its an ok read but nothing ground breaking. If you want some fun insightful chick literature check out the Sophioe Kinsella books. Again Lauren has tricked me and cashed in on my silly love of books and delivered a less then stellar product.
0452289963|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read.  I have never had so many AHA moments as I've had with this book. Give yourself the gift of sight to your true self.  If you are ready to go deep inside yourself, this the book will get you there.  Enjoy the ride!
B0002DKCMQ|5.0|The product was as described. It was new and in the original packaging. I appreciated the prompt delivery. Great (silly) movie! If you like American Pie, you'll love Eurotrip.
B00151HZ3S|4.0|Okay, so we numerous recordings for Wagner's epic Ring Cycle: Krauss, Solti, Karajan, Sawallisch, Goodall, etc. And all of these leave me to one conclusion: the many differences lead me to believe that all of these ring sets have their own authenticities and setbacks. And here we have Bernard Haitink and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra & Chorus.<br /><br />This might be seen as a disappointment to some people. If you want great conducting, then this is for you: Haitink understands the score more than Levine does. If you want a persuasive array of singers, look somewhere else: Levine has a better sounding cast than Haitink's. Overall, Haitink's conducting saves this work from being a total flop. There is nothing quite like his Rheingold & Gotterdammerung (\\"Siegfried's Rhine Journey\\" is a bit forced, but magnificent nonetheless).<br /><br />This may very well be like Metropolitan, because it sounds just as poignant. The only difference that this orchestra has more austerity. While the woodwinds are not as good, the strings sound better and the percussion sound clearer. The leitmotivs are almost never screwed up. First scene of Rheingold will take one's breath away.<br /><br />Let's now focus on the singers. James Morris is a notch below Hotter, Adam, and Bailey, but he overpowers Fischer-Dieskau and McIntyre pretty much throughout Haitink's Ring. His multi-dimensional performances are compelling in Walkure. \\"Nicht send ich dich mehr aus Walhall\\" should not be missed.<br /><br />Hmph. I was hoping that Eva Marton would do well here. I was seriously let down by her strained singing. She does okay in \\"Annunciation of Death\\", but she is at her worst in \\"Immolation\\".<br /><br />Reiner Goldberg appears as Siegmund, while Cheryl Studer performs as Sieglinde. I must say that Goldberg sounds much better as Siegmund than Siegfried (a major flaw in the Levine Ring). His gruff and unsteady voice suits this Walsung, and his performance here is worth a listen. Cherly Studer does what she does best as a Wagnerian soprano. I've heard her sing as Senta in the Sinopoli recording of \\"Der Fliegende Hollander\\" and I was stuck with emotion over her recording. Here, she's not as great, but she still doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Have you ever seen Siegfried Jerusalem on the Levine/Metropolitan DVD? Well, here he is again, and this time, he sings with more valor and enthusiasm in both \\"Siegifried\\" and \\"Gotterdammerung.\\" Bravo!<br /><br />No offense, but Theo Adam, a Wotan for the Bohm Ring, singing as Alberich? Come on . . .<br /><br />Peter Haage sounds like he's entertaining young kids. His version of Mime is a bit childish, and the dark humor that the dwarf brings out sounds-over-the-top here. Nonetheless, he is still entertaining to listen to (\\"Wer halfe mir?\\" has never sounded better).<br /><br />I can summon Heinz Zednik's performance in just three words: Brilliant Beyond Belief! Scene Two is when he's at his finest.<br /><br />The rest of the cast do very fine. The Valkries here sound a bit disappointing; they don't have the sheer power that's found in the Karajan and Solti rings. Studer returns in \\"Gotterdammerung\\" as Gutrune, and she makes it an extraordinary performance. Waltraud Meier and Marjana Lipovsek make excellent Frickas. Matti Salminen makes a great Hunding, though I do prefer Kurt Moll.<br /><br />So in short, the Haitink Ring should not be your first, but shouldn't be your last, either. Buy it for the orchestra and conductor, but not for Brunnhilde or Alberich.an soprano. I've heard her sing as Senta in the Sinopoli recording of \\"Der Fliegende Hollander\\" and I was stuck with emotion over her recording. Here, she's not as great, but she still doesn't disappoint.

B00125WAWS|5.0|The trailers do not do justice for this amazing piece of art! I am a huge fan of both Denzel Washington and Forest Whitaker, but after watching the trailer, I wasn't too sure if I would like to view this movie, but I am very glad that I did as it was a real masterpiece! We have all seen many movies on racial issues, but this one shines on top of them all!<br /><br />I recommend this movie without hesitation! Great cast all around, great performances, great storyline based on real events, great cinematography, and great entertainment!<br /><br />The Great Debaters delivers on many levels the value of love, the evil of oppression, the ugliness of racism, and the beauty of triumph. A must see!
B000E1MTY0|4.0|great movie, HD quality isn't that good though. like with any \\"first in series\\" movie, alot of backstory and becoming of the character takes place. it's to be expected, i can't wait for the dark knight with more action and darkness.
B000KC86F4|4.0|Buy this if you want to see what blue ray is capable of!  Of course, you have to have an HD flat screen to watch this.  The picture quality and sound was great.  Everything was clear about the picture.  You can see the clarity of Beast's paint on his face.  Besides the blue ray part, story plot is a okay.
B000004166|5.0|This album is absolutely flooring. THIS is Mozart. Grumiaux's playing is neither cutesy and fanciful nor forced, as so many renditions of these concertos are. In fact, it falls nowhere on that spectrum at all - these recordings draw from someplace different altogether. They are organic but not harsh, intense but not overwrought, powerful but not bombastic. This music is the kind that reaches down, uncovers your soul a little, and says, \\"Listen.\\" And you do - it is that instinctual.<br /><br />And as someone who tends to insist on the equal merit of various interpretations of a work, I have to say that, a little to my surprise, Grumiaux has become my definitive Mozart man. His music makes me smile involuntarily because it is so full of life.
B000001Y79|2.0|Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt is highly overrated. The songs released were pretty good but after all these years, this album is dated and annoying now. This disc is heavy in ska which is no longer popular, no wonder they had to change their sound after this album. Don't Speak was a great ballad but after you hear it 30,000 times you get sick of it. The only track I still appreciate is Sunday Morning, great hook and chorus. This album is considered their masterpiece, but I've heard better.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I was completely captivated with this soundtrack.  The piano music was superb and dance numbers utterly delightful.  Each time I listen and close my eyes I feel completely transported.  With all due respect to the editorial review...I must ardently disagree with the description \\"monochromatic beige.\\"  It might seem that way if your sensibilities tend toward the overstimulation of the senses but there is such beauty found in the simplest melodies (\\"Dawn\\") and soaring polyphonies.  I could not ask for anything better.
0143038419|1.0|Much in the way that the fabulous writing of Sex & The City ultimately created a generation of women that are career-oriented, self-obsessed, passion-seeking romantic idealists, despite its being a satire, Eat, Pray, Love serves as a platform by which vulnerable women, perhaps those in the midsts of marital troubles, will justify leaving their spouses in search of \\"something better,\\" be it romantic or spiritual.      I'm 24, female, quite financially independent, college educated, and have been in a relationship for two years.  After learning that a co-worker recommended this to another woman, one within the same demographic as the author, as a means of dealing with her trial separation from her husband I immediately took interest.  Sure enough, it's an enjoyable charismatic how-to-divorce-your-husband-and-improve-\\"yourself,\\" if there ever was such a thing-book.      Save you money.  Turn off the television, put down the self-help books and embrace your situations, assuming they don't involve the threat of death, and deal with it.  If anything, read The Last Self-Help Book You'll Ever Need.  It's written by a doctor with a degree and research, not witticisms.      If you are looking for a means of justifying your youth-obsessed, \\"I have so many choices for a mate because I make my own money\\" thinking this would be the book for you.     Like I said, great read, but only through objective eyes.  Beware, vulnerable women.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|These 29 Beatles songs sound as fresh today as they did over forty years ago.  Regardless of whether you saw (or liked) the movie, the renditions of the songs are done faithfully and with great care.  Bono's version of 'I Am The Walrus\\" is an absolute gem of a tune. The Jim Sturgess version of 'Across the Universe' sounds incredible, as good as the original take on the 'Let it Be' album.  Great 2CD collection.

044024238X|5.0|This was the first Sophie Kinsella novel I read.  And I loved it enough to make me buy the rest. Her humor is truly laugh out loud funny--which can be embarrassing when reading on an airplane, but truly enjoyable. I am now reading my third Kinsella novel and still love her witty humor.
B0000AHRB0|5.0|Ken Follet achieves the nearly impossible task of creating genuine suspense about an event that is well-known, using fresh characters, clever plotting, and surprising twists on an old story. You will enjoy this book on a long plane flight, or just sitting out on your porch during the lazy days of summer. I always enjoy Ken Follet's approach to history--crackerjack pacing, strong dialogue, and a deep desire to entertain. If only all writers cared as much about their audience's enjoyment as Follet does, TV would become obsolete.<br /><br />Donald Gallinger is the author of [[ASIN:1601641591 The Master Planets]]
0743270754|4.0|I just finished this incredible piece of work and I was very impressed. My standard for experiencing great historical writing is the author's ability to make me feel like I am living in the period that is being used. She did a fantastic job in achieving that.    There are so many important points to address during this era, and I do agree that elevating the dresses worn by Kate Chase and Mary Todd Lincoln with almost the same amount time given to Grant is............    Curious how little has really changed in politics from the time of Lincoln to 2008. Power, money, treachery, spinning, gaming, etc.     I was awe struck as to how Lincoln and many others in the book were able to recover from so many personal tragedies and issues.  What incredible crucibles for these men and women.    Lastly, I was disappointed how little time was given to the assassination event. Nor, did I know that the plot involved other members of Lincoln's cabinet.    Lack of security in the political world is an issue today and apparently was one back in Lincoln's day. How naive can you be to have such a lack of security during such a dangerous time. It just makes you wonder what they were thinking.    Highly recommend this book if you really want to get to know one of the most brilliant leaders in our history. Makes you wonder where we would be today if someone lesser e.g Andrew Johnson had been at the helm. Can you sing Dixie?

0061150142|5.0|\\"Let us embrace, and from this very moment vow an eternal misery together,\\" a quote by Thomas Otway, appropriately begins this story of young lovers, giving us a concise glimpse of the plot. This is a story of a love so deep and intimate, that it is difficult to define the boundaries of the two individual personalities of the teens. Raised together since newborns, Chris and Emily grew up together, becoming lovers as teenagers. It was always expected that they would end up together. But when two individuals are so close, and the border separating them as individuals becomes blurred, could one ask too much of the other? Could one go too far in the sacrifice of oneself for the happiness of the other? These are some interesting questions that this story poses to the reader.<br /><br />Ms Picoult has created some very intriguing characters here, ones that are real enough to provoke thought and emotion. The juxtaposition of the storyline with the past which ultimately led to it, creates a fervent tension. Unexpected twists in the plot are plentiful and intense. This book is more than entertainment. It presents some very potent questions to ponder.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Donna Summer's first studio album in 17 years is not only a welcomed surprise, but a living, breathing example on how Summer's talent and stamina can never be erased. She's certainly had an accomplished career and one not without numerous struggles and challenges. Though she was labeled \\"queen of disco\\" throughout the 70's(and rightfully so)Summer wanted recognition as a more in-depth artist. 1979's Bad Girls remains one of the most successful recordings of her career, and if you were to listen to that album now, you'd see how Summer pulled off a diverse collection of every kind of music that was considered modern for 1979. Flash forward to 2008 as Crayons has the original dance diva on the pulse of contemporary music but still providing her own stamp on every song.    Following Bad Girls, Donna shifted to Geffen Records, which later proved as a bad mistake, but only because David Geffen didn't share her vision and even underrated her recordings. 1980's The Wanderer had Summer on an artistic and musical ascent that continued from the Bad Girls album, but that recording went mostly unnoticed, and then 1981's I'm A Rainbow, another great recording, never got released(it was later released in 1996)which was rather astounding because it would have been a hit as Summer was still as diverse and in touch with the musical genres of that era(buy a copy of I'm A Rainbow and you'll see what I mean)and I can't help but think that Crayons is sort of like Summer's modern-day opportunity to show the many facets of her talent and emotions as she once did on 1981's I'm A Rainbow, but of course Crayons is fresher and better and will have all the true Donna Summer fans remembering why we loved her so much. She remains diverse and colorful and her powerhouse voice is as powerful and magnetic as ever. Plus the songs themselves will have you wanting to get up and dance again. Check out \\"Mr.Music,\\" \\"Fame(The Game),\\" \\"I'm A Fire,\\" and \\"The Queen is Back,\\"(and she certainly is)to name a few. Donna, next time don't stay away so long.

B000V1Y43W|4.0|I just bought a PlayStation 3 which has a built in bluray player, so I decided to get some bluray movies and this was one of them.  I'd never seen it before.    The movie was pretty good.  I liked the story line even though it's a pretty repeated theme.  The effects were pretty good.  The voices in the movie were excellent (even Owen Wilson...whom I don't normally like).    The bluray was pretty cool but I was getting the feeling like it was almost too pristine.  When I watch a movie, I expect some cracks and pops from the film (I don't like that but) and this one was perfect.  The cars all looked nice and shiny and the scenery was perfect.  But almost too perfect.    Good movie though.

B000025802|4.0|There's little doubt that Rafael Kubelik performing the Czech repertory is a cornerstone of the recording catalog.  That said, there are some problems with this box.  The best sounding recording in the set is the 8th, which paradoxically is the earliest recording of all of them.  It sounds virtually the same as my old cassette (original issue, no Dolby) of the recording, without the tape hiss.  It also is the least representative performance in the set, being fairly straighforward and sounding like it could be the work of a number of different conductors.  The rest of the interpretations are undeniably Kubelik. Compared to other counductors in this repertoire, and I have good sets by Valek and Gunzenhauser, Kubelik's readings of the symphonies sound much more lived in and reflected on than the others.  Sometimes the rhythmic flow bogs down as Kubelik elicits a phrasing or balance that eludes other conductors.  But after listening to this set in its entirety, it is very hard to settle for the interpretations of less personally involved conductors, even Kertesz and Rowicki.  The sound on the first 6 symphonies is quite good, with much detail and fine dynamics, although they are a bit bass shy.  The 7th has sound that is basically good, although it can become cloudy in tuttis.  The 9th, a great performance (I heard Kubelik do this live with the N.Y. Philharmonic, and this version is representative of him in concert.), is hampered by sound that is often dry and murky.  The Scherzo Capriccioso, Carnival Overture, and The Wood Dove are all given elastic and sensitively phrased readings by Kubelik's own Bavarian Radio Symphony, forming an interesting contrast with the more virtuosic Berliners.  In sum, this is a set with problems, but the joy of hearing Kubelik in the lesser known pieces compensates for them.  I also would recommend his Chicago Symphony New World, recorded in excellent Mercury Living Presence monaural sound.

0743290119|5.0|Chasing Harry Winston has everything a girl could ask for in a book. Break ups, sexy flings, globetrotting, pain-in-the-butt mothers--every woman will relate to, or wish she was one of the three main characters in this book. Despite their fabulous New York City careers and connections, these girls aren't perfect--Leigh is completely neurotic, Adriana is a total commitmentphone and Emmy is stuck in a crippling slump. They all need and rely on each other to get through the tough stuff. This is a refreshing story about great frienships, set in the greatest city in the world. It's fun, witty and perfect for the beach.

082249230X|5.0|This is a solid condensed version of the classic search for buried treasure in the late 1700's.  Author Robert Louis Stevenson draws readers in early as the Captain arrives at the Benbow Inn in Britain, focused on incoming ships, and warning young Jim Hawkins of one-legged visitors.  The story picks up as Billy Bones arrives, bringing danger and discovery of the treasure map, a discovery that leads Jim and his companions to risk the long trip in search of riches.  I felt the suspense as Jim's group boards ship with a hardened sea crew that includes Long John Silver and other tough cookies. Then the ship finally arrives at the Island, where Jim and his companions must survive treachery and deadly struggles at the fort - before they even see the treasure.     I just taught this abridged version to English-literate students at a high school in Latin America; most liked it although some wanted even more action. This is a solid read for adventure fans, capable young readers, and those that desire a good story.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|This is a great CD and I listen to it all the time. Definately a must have if you like the first album.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|Half animation, half film this is a take on the fairy tale about Beowulf, man hero from Norway who hunts and kills dragons in Denmark.  Angelina Jolie gets to play dragon mother with a (sexual) taste for the Danish kings.  She uses them to procreate and have baby dragons who torture the local villagers.  Star studded actors that include Robyn Wright Penn, Antony Hopkins and John Malkovich cannot save this movie - that is how bad it really is.  All actors have these really bad nordic accents. I would not recommend it for young children since the film has brash adult humor.  I am so disappointed, I have no more words to describe it.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|Having been named after a mother-goddess was the foreshadowing of Juno MacGuff's life.  Pregnant at sixteen is the unwitting challenge of her few years, one that she undertakes with such detached sarcasm her champions wonder if she really understands the scope of what's happening.  It is that aloof attitude that keeps Juno, her family and friends from being saddled with an otherwise intensely dramatic situation.  Or does it?  I found myself wondering if this film considered itself something teens and adults alike should relate to, with all its witty banter and smarmy camaraderie, or should we embrace such situations exactly as Juno, with a removed understanding of our strengths and limitations and the knowledge that our actions stand to impact a great many others, potentially in wonderful and terrifying ways?<br /><br />Juno hits the mark, and it does so in a refreshingly smart way.  If you want an underlying moral of the story you will find one.  If you want fast-paced tight lines from relatable characters it's all there.  Or you can just take the film at face value--the stellar big screen break-out creation of Diablo Cody, a woman with a keen eye for calling life like it is.

B0006Z2LCE|5.0|Donna Summer Gold is an outstanding two CD set that gives her fans a terrific collection of her hits and other great songs! Donna's voice is in excellent form throughout this album; and the sound quality couldn't be better. The artwork is also very good. This two CD set is a must-have for Donna's fans.<br /><br />\\"Love To Love You Baby\\" is one of Donna's biggest hits; she throws herself into this song and makes it hers and hers alone! The musical arrangement never drowns out Donna; it enhances the song instead. \\"Could It Be Magic\\" has Donna handling complicated tempo and key changes seemingly effortlessly--but, of course, we know it really wasn't that easy. Donna's talents more than carry her through great disco ballads like \\"Could It Be Magic.\\" \\"Love's Unkind\\" has a rock beat that's mixed with a disco beat; this is great music for dancing and I predict you'll enjoy \\"Love's Unkind\\" very much. \\"I Feel Love\\" reminds me of the disco days when the clubs were full of people dancing their cares away--those were great times!<br /><br />\\"MacArthur Park\\" gets a fine treatment as Donna sings this with grace and style. When the tempo changes drastically Donna never misses a beat; and this impresses me. The song may start slow and sweet; but it sure turns strong and hot! \\"Bad Girls\\" is both a great song and the title of one of Donna's albums from 1979 or 1980; and listen for Donna to outdo even herself on \\"Dim All The Lights.\\" \\"Dim All The Lights\\" is great disco and it still makes good dancing music today! The first CD also has a spectacular duet between Donna and Barbra Streisand; \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\" is sure to please you.<br /><br />The second CD continues the hits. \\"The Wanderer\\" has a great beat that is absolutely infectious; and I really like her huge hit entitled \\"She Works Hard For The Money.\\" \\"She Works Hard For The Money\\" has some rather sad lyrics but it still works well as a strong song about survival. \\"Supernatural Love\\" has a great beat and Donna sings this with all her heart and soul--what a belter she is! \\"Dinner With Gershwin\\" is a tune that didn't quite make it all the way but I remember this song well. \\"Dinner With Gershwin\\" is actually one of Donna's better songs. \\"This Time I Know It's For Real\\" has a relentlessly upbeat flavor as Donna sings this beautifully; and the dance beat makes you want to jump up and dance wherever you are!<br /><br />\\"Melody Of Love (Wanna Be Loved)\\" has a magnificent piano arrangement that, along with the brass, makes this number very special as Donna Summer sings this flawlessly. Donna's excellent diction makes her singing all the better, too. \\"I Will Go With You (Con Te Partiro)\\" comes from classic opera but the arrangement is so brilliantly put together that it actually works as a dance song! The second CD ends strong with Donna Summer performing \\"You're So Beautiful.\\" This tune showcases Donna's ability to sing with a more modern dance type of music that we hear in many clubs today.<br /><br />If you ever had doubt about Donna Summer's ability to sing, this will lay your fears to rest. This two CD set is fantastic and it demonstrates just how strong Donna Summer's talents really are. I strongly recommend this two CD set for Donna Summer fans; and fans of disco and modern dance music will like this, too.rt and soul--what a belter she is! \\"Dinner With Gershwin\\" is a tune that didn't quite make it all the way but I remember this song well. \\"Dinner With Gershwin\\" is actually one of Donna's better songs. \\"This Time I Know It's For Real\\" has a relentlessly upbeat flavor as Donna sings this beautifully; and the dance beat makes you want to jump up and dance wherever you are!     \\"Melody Of Love (Wanna Be Loved)\\" has a magnificent piano arrangement that, along with the brass, makes this number very special as Donna Summer sings this flawlessly.

B000E41MS6|3.0|I see I have come late to review this series, so I will not waste your time regurgitating the storyline: please see the numerous 5 star reviews for that.  I will give you what they did not: blatant honesty.<br /><br />WHO has the typical British dry humor, which I do like.  Eccleston's portrayal of the Doctor is truly masterful; it is a character you can really fall in love with.  Rose on the other hand... she is - from what I've seen - the typical British female movie star; not very pretty and a little on the heavy side.  But if you don't need beauty to enjoy a show, then this may be just the series for you.  (I'm not bothered by the lack, but my husband constantly whines about it.)<br /><br />What keeps this from more stars is the special effects.  Being use to Battlestar Galactica, Fire Fly and many other SF US hits, you definitely feel the lack of Hollywood special effects on this series.  It reminds me of watching old reruns of 70's SF.  Even though the story is good, you can't help but almost laugh when the aliens appear.  I hope they invest some of their success in better monster creation.<br /><br />Worthy of a viewing, but not excellent.<br /><br />***** Edit ****<br /><br />Perhaps not very pretty was a bit harsh.  Rose just wasn't beautiful in the beginning, but they've glamorized her and toward the end she does make the very pretty mark.
B0017PCX3O|5.0|Pendulum is back in full force with their sophomore effort \\"In Silico\\"!!  True, the traditional D&B heads who hated \\"Hold Your Colour\\" & said that it was too commercial are gonna hate this one even more, but be a little open minded & you'll love the album.  With the entire band coming from rock based roots, they've switched to live instruments so they can play live rather than just spin their sets.  You can definately hear their rock based past influence in the new album as it's definately lead to a more rock sound & feel.  Pendulum have taken everything good about their 1st album \\"Hold Your Colour\\" & amplified it times 100!  Every track on the album feels epic much like \\"Slam\\" & \\"Hold Your Colour\\" from their previous album.  Now don't get me wrong, the album is definately different.  As I said before, they've gone with a more \\"rock-y\\" kinda sound with alot more guitar & whole lot more vocals.  Anyone looking for pure D&B beware, you may not like waht you find.  The vocals are great though, & sound like something coming from an accomplished artist, rather than the cheezy diva stuff so prevelent in the electronic music scene today.  Also gone are the hard & dark D&B sounds from their previous album with tracks such as \\"Through The Loop\\" & \\"Tarantula\\".  The DB is still there, but they've opted for more of a Breakbeat feel with this album again having to do with playing live instruments now.  Another thing missing from this new album is the blissed out sounds of tracks like \\"Stream Line\\" & \\"Still Grey\\" (a track you won't miss at all if you own the reissue of \\"HYC\\", shame on you).  One thing for sure though is that THIS IS PENDULUM!!  It's different, but you know it's still them.  The only problem I have with the album is that it's over too soon with only 10 tracks & 2 remixes.  I just  hope we won't have to wait another 4 years for their next album.  \\"In Silico\\" is amazing from start to finish with not one dud or filler track & I say \\"Keep it comin'!!!\\"  This is one of (if not the) 1st must own albums of 2008 & something everyone should own.  Pendulum is being described as the new \\"Prodigy\\" & after listening to their sound progress over the years they're absolutely worthy of the name.  This album is gonna be huge, Buy It Right Now!!!<br /><br />As far as the \\"Limited Edition\\" version is concerned, in addition to the album as I said before you also get 2 remixes & a video of \\"Propane Nightmare\\" as well a live performance of \\"Granite\\".  The live \\"Granite\\" video is actually really cool, cause it shows you exactly how cool it is that they're now performing with live instruments.  It's pretty cool to see this big DB track is being hammered out on stage & really kinda gives you a whole new appreciation for the new album as a whole.  The case is a cool flip open tin case about the same size as a regular CD case.  Inside is a protective sleeve holding the disc, the inlay booklet from the regular CD version & foam padding to hold everything in place nicely.  All in all if you're a fan of either the band or the album this is a great buy.  I got my copy from the Amazon.uk site, as the US site has been out of stock since release.  You'll pay $10 to $15 more for this version of the album, but to me it's absolutely worth every penny.  BUY THIS ALBUM!!!(if not the) 1st must own albums of 2008 & something everyone should own.

B00005JPNZ|3.0|It's 1957; Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is still an archeology professor and still in harm's way.  It seems the Russians, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), are searching for a crystal skull believed to have magical powers.  They want it for their army and believe Jones knows where it is, so they kidnap him, he escapes, and the chase is on.  Along the way he meets Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) who needs Indy's help to find his mother, Marion (Karen Allen).<br /><br />I have mixed emotions about this fourth installment in the Indy series.  It was better than [[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 Temple of Doom]] (but not by much), but it had way too many characters in it and the plot was so complicated I honestly didn't know what was going on most of the time.  Happily, it  IS Indiana Jones; the excitement is still the same, the music is great, and when they slow down every once in a while, it's still fun.  Director Spielberg went way overboard on the CGI stuff, though, and put so many death-defying stunts (which Indy walks away from with nary a scratch) that much of it is cartoonish.  I wish they had concentrated on character rather than action.  Ford is still in good shape; it was lovely to see Marion brought back from the first movie and LaBeouf made a pleasant, though unnecessary, sidekick for Indy.<br /><br />It's an exhausting movie to watch and I drifted off to sleep a few times when it became too taxing to try and follow the plot.  I liked the nods to the characters of Indiana Sr. and Marcus Brody and the quick glimpse of the long-forgotten ark from the first movie.  Action fans who can overlook the convoluted storyline may well enjoy this movie.

B0016A2FFG|5.0|Reverend Al Green's back and he's sounding as good as ever. Ahmir \\"?uestlove\\" Thompson and James Poyser of the Roots produced \\"Lay it Down\\" and they're not messing with a good thing.  They don't try to change up Green's backing arrangements or vocal stylings too much so this CD sounds like a 1970's classic Al Green recording.      Plus, they add some amazing new school performers to the mix, including John Legend, Corrine Bailey Rae, and Anthony Hamilton. The Dap Kings' horn section heard on both Amy Winehouse's and Sharon Jones' recent CD is here and adding amazing backing.    It's hard to name a favorite in this 11-song CD, but here are a few standouts:    \\"You've got the luv I need,\\" is going to be used by men everywhere as a marriage proposal.  Bet they stand a better chance of the ladies saying yes with Al on their side. Anthony Hamilton's pretty incredible as a backup--he almost steals the show, but is a consummate performer enough not to.    \\"Take Your Time\\" with Corrine Bailey Rae is a sweet, soulful number that plays just like the title promises.     \\"Stay with me (By the Sea)\\" adds John Legend into the mix.      Al Green really would not have to make another CD ever to keep his standing as one of the finest soul singers in the business, but I for one, am very glad he did.  He's an excellent performer and it's good to see him still out there.      Rebecca Kyle, May 2008
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I love the style of the first two albums and \\"Third\\" comes through well after the 10 year break.  Some bands that put out two awesomely unique releases sometimes fear putting forth more of the same stuff.  \\"Third\\" is not more of the same but feeds the beast that devoured \\"Bummy\\" and \\"Portishead\\" and wanted more.  As I added Portishead to my collection I realized that I needed to come up with a whole new genre because nothing else really fit.  I hope we don't have to wait another 10 years for a new release.

I grew bored reading about her allegedly painful divorce and her frequent crying spells. Overall, the book had the feeling of a weepy, \\"Lifetime\\" movie. If you're heavily into chick-lit and sitting around talking about feelings, you will enjoy this book. This woman seems incapable of ever finding true happiness. With her selfish, restless ways I can see why she failed at marriage and has rejected motherhood.

B0018CWEYY|4.0|Don't get me wrong I love Lost; I've bought all previous seasons, and I'll buy the next ones.     We need to notice that season 4 has been great but also has been shorter (only 14 hours/episodes, only 5 discs), so is not fair it cost the same than a full 24 episode season.     So, I totally agree with A. McDaniel: it is a total rip-off!     Is there anything we can do?
0151013047|2.0|Mr. Hamid is to be commended for writing a page-turning book that engages the reader to finish it one sitting.  The sparse wording manages to be very descriptive, and the plot, though far from a thriller, somehow hooks the reader into persistently reading one more page.<br /><br />However, engaging readability does not excuse content.  Perhap the insight is useful, to see how some who came America to drink of her milk and honey were thrilled and pleased that their adopted nation was brought low.  I struggle to review a book that contains nauseating perversions of logic, when reading such a book might give insight to those who think in such a manner.  It's like trying to give stars to Mein Kampf.<br /><br />Without getting into political discourse, it's safe to say the book suffers in logic.  For examples, the book excoriates America for meddling in every conflict.  Within a few paragraphs, it then blames America for not threatening India with retaliation should they attack Pakistan.<br /><br />The plot also fails in that it blames America for stereotyping a Muslim man who chooses to wear a beard...and then has said bearded Muslim man celebrate 9/11. There are many similar logic discontinuties.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|Daring and adventurous. This goes well beyond Dr. Who. Full of character driven scripts, this show does more for sci-fi TV than anything that's gone before. Be patient with this one because the end will leave you gasping for more. Now that Season 2 has aired on Sci-Fi, I can only say that this is a show that has a life of its own. Really, try not to miss this rich and rewarding series.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|After the lackluster Dirty Harry DVD Series years ago,finally Warner considered the Ultimate Edition of these classics.I got lucky to see the new version of Dirty Harry.I was amazed  about the transfer and the extras very informative.The whole set blows your mind away and is an example who respectful classics should be treated.If you compare these edition with the new Indiana Jones trilogy it's worth every penny.Eastwood is a legend, and the Dirty Harry Series the coolest pictures ever made.So get this box and see why only Eastwood can MAKE YOUR DAY.
0618918248|1.0|I have a new won respect for journalists after reading The God Delusion. Lee Strobel's books,[Case for a Creator; Case for the Real Jesus; Case For Faith] written from the personal professional integrity of that discipline, makes a glaring difference in the believability on this subject.    Richard Dawkins is popular the same way the biting criticism, cynicism, from Simon of American Idol fame is popular. We are a tabloid loving society. Howard Stern gets paid millions of dollars to, 'not tone it down.' Dawkins goes for the shock and awe, and shock you will get. He gets affirmation from other atheists who prod him on. Like the 5 year old who wins the approval of his 7 year old brother by one day telling mom to, \\"Shut up.\\"    But does God have for himself another worthy opponent? Dawkins seems to think so judging by the 22 adjective scornful character assassination of God at the start of chapter 2. If you pulled that paragraph out of this book and put it in The Satanic Bible it would be a seamless fit. Just like heavy metal album cover art, all things holy, sacred, noble, and true are profaned.    Richard can explain away your personnel conversion experience by the science of your brain. It works by electrical pulses and chemical reactions. What you see is only the interpretation of what's there. Therefore your brain can't be trusted, but you can trust his. Exactly. That is why The Bible speaks of the unchanging and eternal. It's a necessary spiritual guide, something we are beggars for without. Why did I not find any Bible quotes that weren't so bent out of shape they were not recognizable? You need a plumb line reading this book to know what straight is, or it might even start to make sense.    I thought this was pretty phony. The greatest scientists of yesteryear Newton, Galileo, Kepler, were all religious. Dawkins corrects history by teaching us they believed in God only because they were expected to. They had no other choice. Interesting, he can't bring himself to respect them for their work and discoveries unless he 'deludes' himself into pretending they were closet atheists. As for his scientific peers, the men who hold a belief in God now? \\"They are looked down upon in baffled amusement.\\" Do you see what I see? In a crowd like that maybe it would be better not to admit to anything. Who needs the grief?    He says belief in God is no different than a belief in the tooth fairy. How many people do you know pour there life energy in trying to prove the non-existence of nothing? I wonder if he's convinced himself yet, or if 8 more books are on the way?    Richard teaches us belief in God stifles the growth of science, stunts the imagination of children,[Richard's parents took him to church where he got a 'splendid imagination'], anchors us in the dark ages, and should be dropped for the betterment of mankind. I wonder if we could test that theory scientifically? Set up an experiment between two groups of people. Atheist and Christians give them a mammoth scientific achievement as a goal, like walk a man on another planet and bring him back safety. And make it a race.    It was called the Apollo program. In the 1960's United States and Russia went head to head in the ultimate scientific, engineering, Olympics of the mind. It was war, a cold war between two ideologies, two world views. The future of mankind no less was at stake.      Russia in 1917 systematically abolished all religion, they banned the Bible and made museums of natural history out of the grander churches. Most though, were flattened, 20,000. It was against the law to own a Bible, the church went underground. They believed if they educated the ignorance out of the people the foolishness and superstition handed down from generation to generation would end. A dangerous leap into uncharted waters. They had a whole generation to tweak the system before their show down with Christian America.    In the United States more than 90 percent of the population believes in a supernatural being. They have a region called the Bible belt. They are unashamedly evangelical and proud of the fact freedom of religion is the core of all freedoms. Dawkins tells us people of faith have lower IQ's are bigoted, hostile, and out of sync with reality. This should have been no contest for the atheists.    Well that challenge was happening 40 years ago. When the lunar program shut down after Russia waved the white flag, the number of men who left their boot prints on the moon was evangelical Christian United States of America 12, Atheistic Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 0.    As for everything else human rights, standard of living, freedom of speech, put it this way. Russia built a wall to keep people in. America couldn't keep them out. Greatest military, greatest scientific achievements by miles. Want more proof? Ask God, cannot the one who made the eyes see? cannot the one who formed the ears hear?
B00005JPNZ|3.0|I wanted to preface my review by saying that I am a huge Indiana Jones fan and was looking forward to this movie more than any other in recent memory.     With that said, here is my to the point review...SPOILERS SPOILERS and more SPOILERS                    The opening segment, like its predecessors, was unique (Elvis music and a 50's car racing military vehicles as a sort of nod to American Graffiti) and definitely brought a smile to my face as Indiana Jones is dragged out of a car trunk and after getting to his feet, he reaches down for the oh so famous fedora and places it on his head.    The movie from this point until the closing credits was a rollercoaster of good and bad, something I am not used to in Indiana Jones movies. Instead of constant narrative, I am just going to throw up a list of good and bad like I have seen others do, with some explanation/summary of why I think it is good or bad.    GOOD  1. The actors/characters do a very good job with a rather weak script. Ford chews the scenery as Indy and plays him in the \\"aw shucks\\" way he always has, except for signs of maturity. His quips and one-liners are still good, but not of the level of the other three movies. Karen Allen does a good job but seems more like a female sidekick than a love interest (as in Raiders). Shia Labouf plays well, Shia Labouf, as is typical with this young actor. This is nothing bad, but he needs to mature as an actor some. He does have some good lines and fight scenes with Ford. Blanchett does an okay job with her over-the-top role, but pales in comparison with past Indiana Jones' villains. In fact, and this seems to be echoed by many others, there weren't too many moments where you thought the Russians would really harm Indy and Co. except for some action fights and Indy's one on one with the ugly Russian. For the most part, the characters/actors do a good job.    2.The music is always good in these movies, BUT come on John Williams, you are one of the greatest composers outthere who always manages to create one lingering melody that can be indentified with all of the movies you score, but in this one, all that stood out was echoes of melodies from the prior movies (particularly Raiders and Last Crusade--so much of Last Crusade, that it even ENDED WITH the musical cue from Last Crusade). The only reason this isn't moved down to the \\"BAD\\" is because the music is great, despite nothing very original.    3. The action scenes are very well choreographed and despite some who say there is too much CGI, I for one did not think it was a distraction (as in the Star Wars prequels) but more of a useful tool to showcase some really good action scenes. Sure it is hard to believe a 65 year old is swinging from a whip (more than he ever has before) but with the CGI and stuntmen, suspension of disbelief is possible.       BAD  1. The plot. It was bloated and unfocused. In no less than 20 minutes, we have Indy being dragged from a trunk, escorted into an AREA 51 warehouse, Indy locating a crate with a metallic coffin for an alien corpse from his discovery in Roswell in 1947, him being betrayed by his colleague, Indy escaping from the warehouse with a glimpse of a cracked box (ark of the covenant peaking out), then concludes with Indy walking into a \\"dummy\\" neighborhood where an atomic bomb test is seconds from happening and he gets into a lead lined refrigerator and BAM, he goes flying into the air as the bomb goes off. The refrigerator lands and rolls many times and then Indy gets out. He dusts himself off and looks at the mushroom cloud. Radiation anyone? Head trauma from bouncing around in the fridge, anyone?  This was one of several \\"I can't believe they did that\\" moments.    2. The quicksand scene where Indy and Marion are being dragged down and she tells him that Mutt is their son. COME ON. I felt insulted as a fan and viewer. Any movie that has the hero tagging along with his son usually ends up being too tongue-in-cheek and corny. Why not havethe big reveal occur with Mutt's life is in danger or more towards the end?     3. Mutt (Shia) swinging like Tarzan on vines with a bunch of monkeys. Completely useless scene that acts like an unintentional gag.    4. A redo of the cliff jeep chase scenes from Raiders. It was like Spielberg wanted to see what that scene would look like with CGI now.     5. The jeep/boat scene going over not one, not two, but three waterfalls--each increasingly unbelievable. This was like Spielberg wanted to redo the classic unbelievable scene from Temple of Doom in CGI and make it three times as unbelievable.     6. The UFO rising from the ground and taking off, which follows the appearance of an alien that looks just like the one from Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. (I rolled my eyes and I heard sighs in the audience. I swear if E.T. had popped up or the music from E.T. or Close Encounters played, I would not have been surprised.)    7. Indy getting married was the final \\"oh come on\\" with me--oops, no--it was the door being blown open and his fedora floating into the chapel that was the final \\"oh come on.\\" If Shia had put it on and winked at the camera, Indiana Jones would be dead to me.    Overall, the bad outweighs the good and that is a shame. Obviously, it is hard to recapture the magic (the lightning in a bottle they caught three times before) after 20 years. I have to shake my head when I read interviews where Spielberg and Co. are asked why it took nearly 20 years and they always say they were waiting on the perfect script. This script is not perfect but not terrible either, it just was not focused. They went in too many directions and even the ending seemed rushed. Even the biggest Indy fans will be disappointed with this average 4th entry in the franchise.
B000RW3VD4|2.0|I was reminded of the movie Wall Street mentioned referred to when reading Liars' Poker a book about bond trading scams. I was amazed to see that another market crash, this time Prime Mortgage could re-occur there seems to be someone always ready to seize the opportunity to make a quick buck and not give a damn about the consequences. Just like Michael Douglas's character says \\"I just move the money around\\". Very compelling viewing and a warning to where you put your stocks and investments. Here in Australia the lending and valuation legislation is much tighter and harder to get a loan, although there are people now lending money to those who cannot afford it, Difference is the properties are not overvalued and the lending bodies just re-possess the property.
159562015X|5.0|Taking a version of \\"Strengths Finder\\" was an assignment for a graduate level class. Posting a review to amazon.com was also part of the assignment. I had not completed any of the previous versions of \\"Strengths Finder\\", and appreciated this format - short narratives and concise analyses for the various traits. I found the descriptors and explanations to be fairly consistent with previous personality assessments, but it was a worthwhile 30 minutes to re-visit this type of exercise. And, the exercise is another assignment that is now complete.
0765357151|3.0|The Movie was great and the book was very good, but they are not the same.  Rather misleading to use Will Smith on the cover.  The protagonist in the book shares little in common with the one in the movie and the story line is vaguely the same subject.  If you are looking for the written equivilant of the movie you will be disappointed.  But it is a good story on it's own.<br /><br />Most of the short stories after the main feature are rather week and at times confusing.  At times they felt like \\"filler\\" to make the book big enough.
0060989157|5.0|For starters I hate reading books. I would start to read one then stop like after the first chapter because I would lose interest in it. Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. When I did it was like I couldn't wait to get back to it to continue reading and see what happens.   Except for reading Clifford the big red dog books in big letters...lol I couldn't remember the last time I finished a book. The book was so interesting that it kept you intrigued as to what is going to happen next. I remember hearing about all of this stuff happening and hearing it on VH1 when they a behind the music with Motley Crue. To actually ready it gave me a different point of view of what was going on in their lives.  For someone that does not like to read I would recommend this book to anybody that is interested in a story of four guys from their point of view. It is interesting, funny, sad, and every kind of emotion that you could think of a person having to go through in their lives.
0452289963|5.0|This is the beginning of understanding.  Once you understand, you can never go back to ignorance.  We should be teaching the principles in schools and everywhere that people gather together for learning, enlightenment, or higher spiritual purposes.
0790737345|5.0|I LOVE this movie! The emotion, the songs, the story... I can watch it over and over. A must see!
0141439661|5.0|Once criticised as being \\"least interesting\\" of Auten's works, I entirely disagree. Sense & Sensibility is one of my favourites, if not favourite Austen novel. Perhaps not as \\"light, and bright, and sparkling\\" as Pride & Prejudice, it is still a wonderful and enjoyable read, and definitely not as dense as Mansfield Park. Personally, I could not put this book down, when usually with Austen I read a chapter or two a day.<br /><br />The dual heroines is one of the most interesting literary techniques here, interlaced with the usual infuriating members of society (John and Fanny, Lucy Steele), silly women (Charlotte Palmer) and men (Robert Ferrars).<br /><br />My only criticism of the plot would be the somewhat rushed ending, but the story goes through regular \\"ups and downs\\" and enough changes of scenery to keep interest.<br /><br />I often prefer the Penguin Classics versions of the Austen novels. They are easy to carry around and have comprehensive footnotes as well as interesting and thought-provoking introductions and appendices. In this version I prefer the original introduction by Tony Tanner, but the introduction by Ros Ballaster is interesting in its discussion of the opposing themes of the novel i.e. first and second attachments, scream and screen, and of course, sense and sensibility.<br /><br />My only criticism of the Penguin Classics version is the cover art, which I don't feel encompasses the true characters of Elinor and Marianne. While I appreciate the use of 19th century art on the Penguin Classics covers, I never feel that they truly embody the character (except for maybe sickly Fanny Price). As a side note, I do like the cover art of the [[ASIN:0192804782 Sense and Sensibility (Oxford World's Classics)]] edition.<br /><br />In ending, if you are an Austen fan, and haven't read this, you must. Furthermore, if you are considering Austen I would recommend either Sense & Sensibility or Pride & Prejudice as first reads. In any case, the Penguin Classics version will not disappoint.

1591840562|5.0|I was somewhat skeptical when I started this book. Though attracted by the author's reputation, I was afraid to find this book yet another shallow collection of information for dummies. I was wrong. The author wastes no time on pontification but rather noninvasively shows what's important and why. Whether to use the technique is then up to the reader. And he does that in a concise and entertaining manner. Most concepts discussed in the book are quite simple and are common sense (as one would expect), but it is nevertheless helpful to have them all together for a solid full picture.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I don't have anything very eloquent to say about this movie, and that's OK I suppose, because the movie isn't eloquent either.  I hated this movie!  I hated the far-fetched stupid story and I hated the shaking camera.  It's a glorified Blair Witch Project, at best.  And that's not saying anything good, in my opinion.  I couldn't get invested in the story.  I watched the whole thing, but at the end, I had no idea what any of the character names were and I couldn't have cared less.  This movie was a real waste of my time.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My daughter and I have still only managed to watch up to the 1 hour and 20 minutes mark of this movie (she just turned 2 and loses interest at that point), but you would have to be an \\"eejit of elephantine proportions\\" to not give this movie 5 stars. It's very good. I look forward to finishing it.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|I loved the movie.  It scratched all my Sci-Fi itches.  Sure, there were a few plot holes here and there.  But overall great acting by Cage, Biel and Moore.  It was also a treat to see Peter Falk.  I loved the scene in the diner where he tests his options for approaching her.    As much as I loved it, the movie failed at the end.  I was expecting to see an alternate scenario, but it just left me hanging, and not in a sequel sort of way. But in a \\"the movie wasn't finished\\" sort of way. If that's the way the book ended, I suppose I can forgive the director for choosing to end the movie that way.  But then I would say that Mr. Dick left me hanging.  Overall great, but the ending was a real let down.
B0013V33DG|5.0|This is absolutely the best video of an opera I have ever viewed!  It's not exactly my favorite opera -- I'm a Mozart Opera Fanatic -- but this production and it's reproduction on DVD are wonderful in all respects: excellent cast, wonderful vocal and orchestral music, great acting and an entertaining production.  Almost as good as being there!
0740748475|3.0|If you're a Calvin and Hobbes fan then you'll probably want to buy this collection, but this recommendation comes with a warning. The packaging and print quality is sadly not all that it should be. On my copy the advertising glue has remained stuck to the fabric of the box, and the fabric has come unstuck at the opening of the box as soon as I removed the first volume from it. The print quality is generally very good, but in places you can see artefacts where the ink has run on the backing paper. Having the entire collection in one place is a really great idea, just let down by the execution of the packaging.
0446677450|3.0|This guy is a poser.  And, a snake oils salesman (of course one could aruge that a successful snake oil salesman knows how to be successful - so in that sense, I guess he is not a poser). But that said, a good con man must mix truth with lies.  He has some really good truths in here.  He is right on about the failings of our educational system to teach about money.  I couldnt agree more. BUT.  Once he successfully breaks down the problems he fails, for the most part, in providing sensible solutions.  If the way \\"Poor dads\\" think is foolish, the way Kiyosaki thinks is specious (sounds good at first but falls aprt under scrutiny). This is great for selling books cuz, a novice will think he is a revolutionary genius but a millionaire will know he is not as brilliant as he sounds - in fact he sounds like a moron.  I ran a small hedge fund with 50 million in assets, and average returns over 20% for 5 straight years. Then retired from Wall St (as a milllionaire) because it was too much of a grind.  I put all my money into real estate (I also agree with him that real estate is - generally speaking - is the way to make your millions) and more than doubled it in 3 yrs.  I read this because so many people raved about it.  I loved his general crituque of the herd mentality of the poor dads out there, but regarding his thinking - while it aint herd mentality, it aint what the really smart and wealthy folks are doing.   Read it if you are pretty clueless about money or you suspect you might be a smart member of the herd, and it will get you thinking IN GENERAL about money in a better way (but there are better books out there for this).  Then read other books to find out how to make money - now that you no longer are part of the herd.  Don't read it if you are a successful entrepeneur already. It is a joke.   BTW, I am rich and I dont teach my kids much of the stuff he claims that rich folks teach their kids, they would go broke.
B0013HA838|5.0|David McVicar is one of my favorite opera directors. He always has something new to say about the opera he is directing, but never forcing himself at the expense of the composer and librettist. Musically, this is a very good performance, especially by Miah Persson as Susanna, Gerald Finley as The Count and Erwin Schrott, as Figaro. Antonio Pappano is these days one of the very best opera conductors.     Highly recommended.
0743201140|2.0|The title implies that it will help YOU discover and use YOUR strengths, but it is actually more of a management/hiring book- it helps you place other people to use THEIR strengths effectively.  Since I am in sales, (and only have one assistant who doesn't need much managing) it wasn't much of a help.  The personality test wasn't even helpful.  The book recommends that you use it to \\"hone your strengths\\" and then it doesn't tell you how to go about doing that.  If I were managing 20 or so employees and had to make a lot of hiring decisions it might have been helpful- it did discuss how to match people with different talents to appropriate jobs.  Since I am not- it was a total waste of time and money.
0553288105|4.0|This was quite a unique novel, offering a look into a parallel universe structured upon laws of physics completely different from our own. The books is divided into three stories, one of which takes place in the aforementioned universe, and I have to say Asimov's attempt to describe life through the other universe is applaudable. Despite the completely alien forms, culture, and environment, he successfully achieves reader sympathy with characters who have nothing physically relatable to us, outside of intellect.    At first I became concerned with where the story was going when it was clearly identified that the plot revolved around a device called the Particle Pump. The branding felt childish and unrealistic, and I felt I would lose interest as the novel progressed. Fortunately, this was not the case. The story blossomed in a way that made the device's drab title insignificant; it was the ideas surrounding the device that was unique.    After completing the book I did some research about it and was pleasantly amused how the concept originated. Apparently, during a conversation Asimov had with fellow author Robert Silverberg, the subject lead to some random atom isotope being called out, Plutonium-186, to which Asimov replied that such an atom could not exist because it defied the laws of physics. This book was Asimov's personal explanation, offering a possibility on how such a particle could exist.    Overall I would have to say I enjoyed the book and felt it had intriguing concepts. For those who enjoy the idea of parallel universes, and like to see diversity of setting, a trademark of Asimov's Foundation series, this fits the bill. But, I would disagree with Asimov (who favored this over all of his sci-fi works), and say that it wasn't his best in the genre. Because of this, I would really only recommend this to those already fans of Asimov.
0743486285|5.0|I have to commend Nikki Sixx for having the courage to publish this book.  This is a book that gives access to a man at his most vunerable.  This may not be the best piece of literary work every written. However, given the fact that the majority of the book was written as journal entries it gives a sort of real time experience into the dealings of a man lost in a sea of addiction.  Good job Nikki!
B00003CX8V|2.0|Although this is billed as a comedy, it's only so in the sense that just as \\"Macbeth\\" was a tragedy and \\"Twelfth Night\\" was a comedy, this film is a comedy.  What I mean is that over the years, the jokes are still amusing but not really funny anymore and in fact some of them are just downright corny e.g. the \\"you should see my backhand\\" line.  Still, this film is very poignant and touching and really came to life for me towards the middle and end when it addresses the cruelty inflicted on women by men who just wanna have fun with no regard to the consequences.<br /><br />Women are treated like chattel although you find some difficulty in finding sympathy for them when you realise that in some way, they brought it upon themselves.  If women only respected other women and played on the same team, \\"men\\" like those portrayed here wouldn't even have a chance to use them so easily.  If you don't want a homewrecker to come destroy your marriage just don't be one yourself!  Imagine if all women stuck to this credo...<br /><br />Anyways, both Lemmon and MacClaine put in very good performances here as the sympathetic man who realises just how bad his involvement in aiding and abetting his colleagues in cheating on their wives truly is after seeing the results on his victim MacClaine whom he really loves makes a selfless sacrifice of his own with regards his career to do the right thing and MacClaine as the \\"victim\\" who realises what true love is about.  I thought I couldn't hate Fred MacMurray any more than when he was Neff in \\"Double Indemnity\\" but his acting is so good here that I actually found myself hating his character even more here although it goes without saying that \\"Double Indemnity\\" is the far, far better film.<br /><br />This is a very good film except that this DVD version is very poor.  The film hasn't been restored in any way and so the picture quality is poor with imperfections galore and the sound quality in Mono is also very poor.  There are also no special features worth mentioning at all.  Here's hoping that a Blu-ray version with full high quality restoration work on both picture and sound quality is on the horizon.  Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround or better options would be nice as well as a frame-by-frame picture cleanup to do justice to a deserving best film Oscar winner.<br /><br />Recommended but wait for a better restored version to surface.ioning at all.

0671015206|5.0|I am a financial advisor and I frequently loan this book to clients and they usually love it.  Its also a great book to give to young people.  It really gets across the message that you don't have to make a lot of money to be wealthy, you just have to live below your means and invest well.  Highly recommended.
0439882826|5.0|Thanks to all the wonderful reviews, I ordered this book with confidence for my 7 year old son who is a total Star Wars fanatic.  The first book I received was defective and only one of the light sabres lit up.  Amazon was fantastic and shipped a replacement that I got the very next day.  THANKS AMAZON!!  Order this book for the Star Wars lover -- they will flip over it.  My son cannot put it down.  My suggestion is that if you order it for a gift, open it first to make sure the light sabres both work.  I love ordering from Amazon because I know they will always make it right.
B000VI70WM|4.0|I'm not really into the whole Timberlake/Timbaland scene personally, and today's new \\"pop\\" just doesn't reach out and grab me.  Hence my delay in snagging this album.  I grew up with \\"Rio\\" & \\"A View to a Kill\\" being popular, and was afraid that this album would be a disappointment since it ventured so far from the older Duran sounds.  I had batted the idea of purchase around since Dec. 07 - about when it came out.  I didn't really get to hear much of the album until I saw them in concert last week (by the way, great show!)  Actually seeing the band in motion as they performed the tracks from this album changed my perception of the whole thing.  They had so much energy and had so much fun during the concert with the songs they performed from RCM.  I guess they needed a musical \\"break\\" from the standard Duran Duran sound.<br /><br />This album is getting extremely addictive.  I like most of the tracks, but Falling Down is becoming a favorite because it is a very well done song both lyrically and musically.  Kudos to Duran Duran to try something new, and for carrying it off with their trademark fashion and grace.  The album as a whole is very well organized and brimming with energy from beginning to end.  I think more guitars and a more distinct \\"rock\\" sound would have made it more Duran-esque, but I really do enjoy this album as a whole just because it's very well put together and down at the heart of it, it's still Duran Duran.  Every now and then, we all need a break from the same old thing, and I think that's what prompted them to produce this album in a new format.  Overall, I'm very happy with the album.

B0015XASFS|5.0|The newly released Awake Live CD/DVD combo is a in a word \\"fabulous\\". The blend of Josh's incredible voice with his terrific pop/rock/clasically infuenced band of musicians is just a joy to watch and hear. I don't even know how to answer when someone asks \\"what type of music does Josh sing?\\" I just have to answer, great music, pleasing to just about anyone.  In the DVD concert, Josh gives his voice a slight rest and lets the band show off a little, they really take advantage of their 10 minutes in the spotlight. Starting out with Lucia Micarelli's incredible violin solo then the band joins in. It's amazing.  Josh is amazing, the band is amazing and the combination of all of them is just incredible.  The best music CD and DVD that I have bought in many years. AND what a bargain too...
1592402038|4.0|As 532 other reviewers have (by in large) said, Lynne Truss's book is a funny and enjoyable rant about proper punctuation.  It's also remarkably poorly punctuated for a grammar book.  In some passages, Truss uses a forest of commas that get in the reader's way; in others, she omits commas that the reader needs to understand her meaning -- and there's little rhyme or reason for why she goes from one extreme to the other. In one section, after stating that her goal is to get \\"the greatest clarity from punctuation,\\" Truss writes:  \\"There is a rumour that in parts of the Civil Service workers have been pragmatically instructed...\\" when she means (for clarity):  \\"There is a rumour that in parts of the Civil Service, workers have been pragmatically instructed....\\"  There are many, many other examples that will (or should) leave punctuation sticklers shaking their collective heads.  That said -- and I feel much better now for saying it -- Truss's good advice and entertaining writing far outweigh her occasional bad usage, making this a grammar book worth buying.
0793542049|5.0|This book is very helpful to theory and practice of bass lines whether in jazz or any other.  I enjoy playing along with the CD that comes with it.  I've used some of the lines to improvise with a guitarist and we simply jam for fun.  Its very good and I suggest it for the intermediate player to learn great theory and to help develop new bass lines.

0743298039|5.0|Margaret Lea owns a bookshop with her father.  She is a bibliophile, having read every book written by classic authors or writers who no longer exist.  She writes biographies about dead authors, trying to immortalize their work by learning something about them, but doesn't publish any of her writing except for one essay about two brothers.  And that is how Vida Winters, a mysterious and recluse author who is known for her bestselling literary work, most notably for her first book, a collection of thirteen stories.  Or at least it had been intended to be thirteen, but only twelve of them were published, and the publisher made the mistake of submitting the book with the title Thirteen Tales of Change and Desperation.  Winters is also known for making up stories about herself in each interview.  Apparently, she is now prepared to tell her true story to Margaret.  But after years of lying to the media, should she be believed?  After some deliberation (and some thorough fact checking after her initial meeting with the author), Margaret travels to Yorkshire to interview Miss Winters, and what she discovers is a story so bizarre -- full of ghosts, mental illness, incest, nosy governesses, etc. -- that it would rival Jane Eyre and other similar gothic stories.  Winters's real life tale also reminds Margaret of her past, a missing part of her life that she had tried to escape since she was a child.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is one of the darkest, most intricate and can't-put-it-down stories I have read in quite a while.  As far as thought provoking literature goes, it is right up there with Vertigo by Lauren Baratz-Logsted and The Keep by Jennifer Egan as the best read I've had in the last year or so.  Once I turned to the first page it became impossible to stop reading.  The story in itself is very complex, lots of twists and turns, that it's impossible to describe in a single paragraph, and it is something you have to read yourself in order to grasp everything.  I like the fact that the main character is a book lover.  I also like Miss Winters's insights on writing and storytelling.  The story-within-a-story format is very well done; you will never be confused, wondering who is narrating the story in what given time.  The gothic elements are awesome.  It does remind you a great deal of Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre and Rebecca (the previous two novels are mentioned a lot here, especially Jane Eyre).  This dark story ends on a bittersweet note and I already miss the characters and the journey Margaret had to take in order to uncover the various mysteries and secrets in Vida Winters's life.  If you haven't read The Thirteenth Tale then I suggest you do.  Diane Setterfield is a new author whose work I will look into in the future.  If you like suspense, literature or gothic stories (or all of the aforementioned genres), you cannot go wrong with this gorgeous effort.  But make sure you won't have a whole lot to do when you pick up this book, because you may not be able to put it away once you get started.e the fact that the main character is a book lover.

B0002F6BRE|4.0|ELF is a warm humorous family Christmas tale.  Will Ferrell is hilarious as Buddy who in his own words is a \\"human raised by elves.\\"  That's elves like Santa's employees not the ones that inhabit Tolkien's Middle-earth.  Needless to say Buddy has several differences from his adopted family and friends most notably his size which provides quite a few laughs in the first few minutes of the film.  The major plot point occurs when Buddy gets to meet his biological father, a stern man played by James Caan, who works as a children's book publisher in New York City.  There are misunderstandings at first between the naive Buddy and his city smart dad but a happy ending is in store for father, son and extended elf family.
0312323867|5.0|I'm def. going to read all of the books in this series by Emily Giffin.

B000059TEP|5.0|Generally speaking, I have enjoyed most of Ptrick Swayze's movies. I consider him to be an underrated actor. While he often plays a noraml person, he seems unusually talented in letting circumstances around him affect his normal personality within reason.<br /><br />The movie starts with peaceful and normal as Swayze, Moore, cleaning their new apartment with help from thier friend Carl. Through good directing, there is a tragic foreshadowing of the events of this story. Moore and Swayze are lovers, but Moore can not convince him to marry her. (This underlines that just because you are intimate with someone and feel you love them, that does NOT mean that you are ready to make a complete gift of yourself to the person, which means the love is incomplete.)<br /><br />Early on, Swayze is murdered, and it APPEARS to be a typical robbery. The scene where Swze realizes that he is dead is full of DEEP sadness, but is still done with artistic beauty. One wonderful thing about Swayze is that he can be strong, BUT STILL VULNERABLE AND ENDEARING!<br /><br />Moving on, Swayze goes through the deep sadness of being able to be with Moore (in a way) but powerless to comfort her in her sadness. (Talk about poignant!)<br /><br />Without going into too many details, Swayze learns his murder may have been only a part in an elaborate crime, and that Moore is in danger. He finds help from a pyschic medium (Goldberg) She is shifty and she often cheats people, but she is HILARIOUS! She is frightened when she realizes that she can actually hear Swayze. She adds the VERY MUCH NEEDED comic relief to this story. Without her it would have been too morose. At first she reluctantly helps Swayze to get rid of him; but then she helps him because she finds she may be in danger; but then because she grows to care about Swayze and Moore. WONDERFUL FORMULA!<br /><br />There is just the right touch of the Scooby Doo formula. (Linking ghosts to criminal activity, only this time, the ghost is the good guy!)<br /><br />it is interesting that when for obvious reasons, Moore and Swayze can no longer be intimate they discover the depth of their love. Patrick did lay down his life for her, and as Jesus said: \\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man may lay down his life for his friends\\" (\\"John\\" 15:13).<br /><br />Swayze has made many great movies, but this is arguably his best! It is a perfect combination of love, sadness, suspense, and comic relief. Also, in the event you don't know this, Patrick Swayze has cancer. Please keep him in your prayers.for obvious reasons, Moore and Swayze can no longer be intimate they discover the depth of their love.

B0016A2FFG|5.0|Al Green is back!!  This album is the best soul album that Al has released in years.  Questlove and the great James Poyser brought out the best in Al.  The music is vintage and Al shows us that he has not lost his swagger.  I am thoroughly impressed with this album.  Support soul music.  Peace Brothers and Sisters.
B0010VD7EO|2.0|Certainly, this album has been in heavy rotation in every hipster juke box in the western hemisphere ever since the band toured with fellow keyboard-pop icons Of Montreal... What I don't understand is why people are listening. The initial keyboard hook on Time to Pretend is an impressive pop riff, but they follow it up with alot of boring, melodically conservative dribble. The lyrics on the album are alot of juvenile, upper middle class rubbish about getting famous, and living like a rockstar. They muck around in cliche constantly. The album's most impressive asset is the FANTASTIC production by Dave Fridmann. The drums and keyboards balance perfectly. The most listenable track being Electric Feel, is a direct disco rip off, in the vein of The BeeGees. This is just one more overrated pop band, masquerading as indie rock heroes, that people will be ignoring in a few months.<br />Enjoy it while it's fresh, children!
0810994739|5.0|My eldest son is a very reluctant reader.  Even bribery can't convince him to open a book of his own accord.  Since I am a bibliophile, this drives me insane.  However, at Christmas he visited with a friend for a few days.  This friend had received Diary of a Wimpy Kid for Christmas and my son read the whole thing while he was there.  So, for his birthday, I purchased both the first and second books in this series.  At first, he felt the present and said, \\"Oh, great, a book.\\"  Then, when he saw what books they were, he was thrilled.    I read the first one, shortly after hearing he had read it.  I could understand the appeal.  It is funny, easy-to-read and fully illustrated.  Any pre-teen guy would love these books!  Even grown men would probably get a kick out of reading these books!  Too fun!!

B0009V1GDK|1.0|I think it's really odd wierd al didn't call this \\"wiener boy\\" and write more songs about food.  I'm a little cloudy on the facts during this era in his career, but he must have been more politically or abstractly driven or something.  There's a lot of chewing mentioned in \\"drain you\\" and something about all you can eat fish in \\"something in the way\\", I was happy about those.  But otherwise there isn't a lot of substance here.  Maybe it's about novicane, he must have just gotten back from the dentist on the lot of songs, so maybe I'm just misunderstanding him here, and it really is a platter of classic wierd al.  But from what I can tell, it's about an underwater boy chasing a dollar, because he's trying to make ends meet so he can buy his girlfriend a bathing suit.  There's this one part about him being sold for food, which is really morbid for wierd al, but it must part of the plot.  You see, the underwater boy couldn't live on land anyway, so they sold him down the river so they could buy a gun.  Then the underwater boy meets his girlfriend in \\"drain you\\" and they eat food with his last dollar, so he has to get that other dollar so his girlfriend can swim around with a shred of decency.  Not sure what they end up doing in endless, nameless, but they don't sound very happy.  Yea, way to jump on the \\"avant-garde non-sensical prog-rock\\" band wagon wierd al.

I wandered on and found other great music, in Yes, Tangerine Dream, early Genesis, middle Floyd, so I wasn't deprived. But this is a **stunning** album that I could have found years ago.  In 35 years of seriously listening to music I've never encountered more cathartic, enchanting and fulfilling pieces. Dang, I should become the ancient mariner and stoppeth one of three. My loss is my albatross, and this review is my atonement...  You'd risk more than the cost of this album on a suspect book or over-hyped movie: treat yourself.

0060977493|4.0|I enjoyed this story for a multitude of reasons. It took me a little time to adjust to the author's writing style, but once I did I felt the story moved fluidly through the past, present, and future. The story is set in India, and exposes a culture of inhuman servitude that is the backdrop for themes of love and death, loneliness and regret, and of shocking disparities that will persist in society as long as differences among people exist. I was confused at first with who the characters were, and how they were related to each other, but this smoothed itself out and vivid, plush characters were revealed. Characters that struggled to manifest their dreams, heal their brokenness, rectify the wrongs in their lives, and appease the world around them. This book is poetically written, and I can see how this wouldn't be appealing to all. But for me, the author's beautiful style transformed everyday disappointments and lifetime atrocities into a witty, humorous, sympathetic, and moving account of lives that seemed so far removed yet so close to home.

B000YAA68C|1.0|I love Swank & Butler, & Bates.<br />The movie begins (uncomfortably) with a very contrived fight scene that doesn't work and isn't staged well. Butler, while beautiful, only seems at home in the scene in Ireland. All the other flashbacks never work quite right.  Bates is good as the Mom, but all through the movie I felt I was missing something.<br />The friends setup doesn't work - there's no chemistry between Kudrow, Gershon & Swank. It always seems awkward. Also awkward was the one-night stand Swank has with Billy Gallagher. That just did not seem in keeping with her personality throughout the movie. How odd.<br />The kareoke scenes were TORTURE.<br />Literally two-hours of self-pity for a young woman who's lost her husband. Connick Jr.'s Daniel wasn't silly or unlikable enough so you end ticked off because you're led to believe they'll be together.<br />Not much about this movie was likable. The actor who played Billy Gallagher was very good and him telling Holly stories about Jerry was endearing. That's about the best thing I can say. And the Irish scenery was gorgeous. I can't recommend this movie.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I JUST LOVED HER MUSIC. NO MATTER WHAT SHE IS A GREAT SINGER! IT IS A GREAT ALBUM.
B0019SA1F6|4.0|From their earliest moments, Ladytron was always a band that was so far left of the norm that any mainstream success seemed like a far-fetched fantasy.  With thick synths, harsh vocals, and nothing that sounded even remotely ordinary, they eventually gained some sort of widespread recognition with cult hits like \\"Seventeen\\" and \\"Destroy Everything You Touch.\\"  Their most recent album, Witching Hour (2005), was a giant leap forward for both the band, and their unique style of electronic pop.  Velocifero continues this trend with songs that are much easier to swallow without completely disowning their signature sound.  Simply put, Velocifero is easily the most accomplished Ladytron album to date.<br /><br />The album begins with could generally be considered the antithesis of my above statement.  \\"Black Car,\\" a song whose vocals are spoken in Bulgarian, doesn't immediately sound like the most listener-friendly of songs.  But this bizarre opener is completely infecting with its compelling drum beat and layers of bell synths.  While the lyrics are really the only thing worth complaining about, one can't really fault the group's artistic vision, as the song is still quite enthralling.  On the other hand, \\"Ghosts,\\" was seemingly hand-crafted to be Velocifero's first single.  Like \\"Destroy Everything You Touch\\" before it, the song has an abnormally catchy vocal melody and anthemic instrumentation.  Even in my first listen, I found myself humming along to the chorus of, \\"There's a ghost in me/ who wants to say \\"I'm Sorry.\\"/ Doesn't mean I'm sorry.\\"  By my second listen, I was singing along with them.<br /><br />The upbeat and driving, \\"I'm Not Scared\\" is perhaps the most appropriate song on the album, considering that \\"Velocifero\\" translates to \\"bringer of speed.\\"  It may also be the loudest song, though I don't really know what word translates to \\"bringer of bleeding ears.\\"  Were I a betting man, I would have no issues with betting on \\"Runaway\\" being the album's second single.  The instrumentation here is a bit more thinned out than on the song it follows, and the song's topic is just begging it to be the next theme song for every rebellious teen on the planet.  That's not to discredit it, however, as \\"Runaway\\" is easily one of the band's strongest songs to date, despite the fact that \\"my little runaway\\" is repeated endlessly towards the song's end.  \\"Season of Illusions\\" and \\"Burning Up\\" don't really have much to offer and really drag the album's momentum down (which apparently is possible).  The latter really has a classic Ladytron sound to it, so the more loyal fan my find it enjoyable.  I, however, do not.<br /><br />\\"Kletva\\" again brings back the Bulgarian language, though this time it is sung rather than spoken.  Like its contemporary, the song is really very intriguing.  For most of the song's first two minutes, the band uses a  very eclectic mix of synth sounds, and the result is unlike anything I've heard from them before.  It is very, very cool.  'They Gave You a Heart, They Gave You a Name\\" is another candidate for second single, with a very clear and pretty vocal melody.  Its got a noticeable groove to it, and Helen's vocals are really in top form as she sings \\"They gave you a heart/ they gave you a name/ released to the wild/ with no one to tame.\\"  \\"Predict the Day\\" takes an alternate approach, using much harsher drums and synth sounds, but doing so in an enjoyable manner.  Unfortunately, the vocals on the song are kind of weak, and I've found myself just longing for an instrumental version of the song.  The instrumentation on this one is undoubtedly Velocifero's best.<br /><br />\\"The Lovers\\" clocks in as Velocifero's shortest track, but still manages to be a favorite of mine.  The song sounds like a Death Cab for Cutie song with all instrumentation replaced by crazy electronic instruments.  The anthemic declaration of \\"We are the lovers,\\" just sounds like it was ripped from a Ben Gibbard songbook.  \\"Deep Blue,\\" meanwhile, sounds more like a throwback to classic New Wave sounds, albeit with a Ladytron twist.  Here, Mira sings, \\"Deep blue, I want to give it all to you/ Deep blue, I know that scares you,\\" over some truly great instrumentation that even includes a violin (a real one!).  The band ends the album on a high note, with \\"Versus,\\" an unbelievably cool sounding song.  The addition of an acoustic guitar, trumpet, and whistle give it a very distinctive spaghetti-western vibe.  It seems completely out of character for a band like Ladytron, and perhaps that's why I simply can't get enough of it.<br /><br />As with any Ladytron album, I am going to have some complaints.  The big one, of course, is the fact that the vocals never blend well with the music.  When you have so many layers of instrumentation going on, this is bound to happen - as it has on almost every Ladytron song so far.  It is no fault of their own,  just an unfortunate byproduct of the type of music that they so masterfully create.  Any fan of the band will expect this, however, so as long as you know what you're getting into, this shouldn't be a problem.  I also feel that the album could be about 2-3 songs too long, and could have used some trimming.  Of course, these are only small, insignificant asides to what is an otherwise highly enjoyable listening experience.  Velocifero is definitely my favorite album that Ladytron has crafted thus far, filled with so many unique styles and sounds that it can only be described as \\"stunning.\\"  With each album that the band puts out, they slowly inch towards mainstream acceptance.  Velocifero may not be the one that does it completely, but it will certainly recruit more unsuspecting listeners to their unique, enchanting style.  Perhaps that is good enough.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Ghosts\\"<br />2. \\"Runaway\\"<br />3. \\"Kletva\\"<br />4. \\"They Gave You a Heart, They Gave You a Name\\"<br />5. \\"Versus\\"<br /><br />7 out of 10 Starsto classic New Wave sounds, albeit with a Ladytron twist.

Velocifero is definitely my favorite album that Ladytron has crafted thus far, filled with so many unique styles and sounds that it can only be described as \\"stunning.\\"  With each album that the band puts out, they slowly inch towards mainstream acceptance.  Velocifero may not be the one that does it completely, but it will certainly recruit more unsuspecting listeners to their unique, enchanting style.  Perhaps that is good enough.    Key Tracks:  1. \\"Ghosts\\"  2. \\"Runaway\\"  3. \\"Kletva\\"  4. \\"They Gave You a Heart, They Gave You a Name\\"  5. \\"Versus\\"    7 out of 10 Stars
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I love Sigur Ros  I love many artists that Amazon helps selling their songs  BUT I HATE the simplicity of major BIG companies how they seem only to be interested in non creative MAINSTREAM thinking.  SO Amazon sells most if not all only songs in the .mp3 format  a LOW-FI format that never should have been invented in the first place as it gives audiophile quality a LOWER priority than anything else.    lossless formats to store music is the answer (.flac for instance) but major companies follow main stream values...  PLZ ppl, COMPLAIN that is THE ONLY  way major companies are wiling to introduce change as soon as they have implemented their own strategies

B000001DYA|5.0|1968, when this album came out, was a busy year on the music scene.  Pretty much everyone was still wrestling with Are You Experienced? - the Hendrix debut.  That album was so technically dazzling and daringly innovative that it dwarfed everything else happening at the time - which is saying rather a lot.  Vincebus Eruptum came from California, but had none of the ethereal, spacey sound characteristic of Cal - especially San Fran - groups.  While it lacked the technical virtuosity Hendrix demonstrated - you couldn't deny it either.  It commanded attention.<br /><br />Vincebus Eruptum artfully combines the subtly of professional wrestling with the acoustic dynamics of jackhammers.  This group was only after two things - volume and intensity.  While the \\"power trio\\" was not a new concept then - see Hendrix and Cream - Blue Cheer definitely kicked it up a notch.  The album is surprisingly entertaining to listen to today, 40 years after its release.  This is perhaps because - amazingly - it introduced a prodigiously influential sound.  You can say it gave rise to heavy metal if you like, but frankly, I'm much more taken by the resemblance to Led Zeppelin.  The ear-bleed volume, the desire to over-do everything, and the certainty that the harder you strike an object the more compelling your point will become, all scream Zep.<br /><br />Blue Cheer manages to handle two blues classics in pretty respectable fashion, and their rendition of Parchment (sic) Farm helped put a little jingle in the pocket of its author, Mose Allison, which is a good thing.  The LSD references, and they could hardly be stronger - Blue Cheer being slang for a type of LSD - a poem by LSD purveyor, Owsley, on the jacket - are something of a mystery.  LSD, for you kids out there that never tried it, tends to be a rather cerebral, breezy experience, something akin to floating in an aquarium full of exotic, tropical fish - and being able to communicate with them.  This music, by contrast, which is ideally suited to smashing your head against a spinning millstone, calls to mind different intoxicants.  Moonshine perhaps, crystal meth, or sterno.  It's a fun little album, absolutely unruly, but good fun.  If you decide to buy it and play it, make sure your neighbors are out - or dead.shing your head against a spinning millstone, calls to mind different intoxicants.

B000UJ48UO|4.0|Having gone through at least SOME of what the movie portrays, I can tell you, that this is the closest I've seen to date on what Marine Corps boot camp was like in the 60s. The DI as played by Ermey is so dead-on it's scary. The only major gaffe was Joker and others calling the DI \\"you\\". That would not be allowed. He would have been \\"the Drill Instructor, Sir\\" and Joker would have referred to himself as \\"the Private\\". Boot camp was so traumatic for just about everyone that everything after that WAS like throwing a switch. There was a disconnect. The sudden jump to VietNam in the movie was perfect, I thought. Joker's desire to get out in the bush and leave the relative comfort of the \\"rear\\" was true to the experience too. Being \\"in country\\" was surreal on it's own. Teenagers with loaded weapons... far from home and scared... and you would suddenly, in the middle of nowhere, run into guys you had known in boot or another duty station. The only two films I've ever seen that had truly great USMC advisors were this one and \\"Coming Home\\". So many subtle nuances and Corps tidbits. I love this movie. It isn't perfect, but it occupies a place in a time that I share... it reminds me of young men who became my best friends and bizarre situations that I can never really explain to anyone who didn't go through them.
0307346617|5.0|I can't really add much that hasn't been said in other reviews. I never read MB's Zombie Survival Guide, but I heard good things about WWZ, and picked it up. It reads exactly how it was supposed to. As an oral narrative of a zombie outbreak of global proportions.    While I disagree with a few (very few) points made by Brooks, he mostly nails everything, from China's actions, to South Africa, etc. There is no liberal/conservative slant in this book that some of the negative reviewers referenced. Just an honest look at how the world works, and how it would look under threat of human genocide.
0743455967|5.0|From the first page to the last, Stephen King lays it on the line with total honesty. Begun before his near-fatal accident and finished months later, this book covers everything from the pain of the blank page to the necessity for good grammar and punctuation, to--my personal favorite--revision by cutting. He surprised me when he confessed that very often his characters surprise him; they take the story in directions he hadn't thought of because, in a sense, they become real people--capable of acting in the situations he gives them. I was delighted to read that, no, he doesn't plot out every event of every novel in advance. Rather, he starts with a situation, plugs a few characters into it, and sees how they react. It's much like real life. Along the way he gives a few hints about editing, starting the story, writing dialogue, pacing, description, and other tools, but this is not a primer on how to write fiction. In fact, he tells us right out that the only way to write fiction is to read a lot of it and then write it--alone, every day, no excuses. No quick routes to success, no writer's workshops, no instant fixes for your flawed manuscript. Though he didn't say it so much in these terms, his advice on description is excellent. No one is interested in your description of the forest; what they want to know is what happens to your hero when he's there. Get to it! Good stuff. I read it in two days, and there wasn't a false note in the whole thing.

B0012QCZ54|2.0|Okay, I'm from Baltimore where both of the Step Up movies were filmed, not to mention that Jenna Dewan (Nora Clark) is my FAVORITE actress.  So as an absolutely HUGE fan of the original movie I was ecstatic when I found out that they were filming a sequel.  Then I found out that they were filming a sequel ... sort of.      Don't get me wrong, Step Up 2 is a decent movie, but it unfortunately suffers from the proverbial curse that says \\"the sequel is never as good as the original.\\"  Now it COULD have been, there was HUGE potential in a sequel if it was taken in the right direction.  But in my opinion, the failure to have both Channing Tatum AND Jenna Dewan back was a mistake.  I would have loved to have seen the sequel present Nora (Jenna) as an instructor at the Maryland School of the Arts.  Maybe Tyler (Tatum) as a student.  FOLLOW THE STORYLINES OF THE ORIGINAL MOVIE!      But no, Channing Tatum was in the sequel for all of about ten minutes and Jenna's character was only barely mentioned.  Maybe there is hope f or a third movie that would bring back the REAL star of what could have been an amazing movie franchise.

1591841666|1.0|This book was awful! It tells you to quit, then not to quit, then says to watch out for cliffs and cul de sacs, but never shows you how to recognize whether you are in a dip, on a cliff, or in a cul de sac. Also, the book states numerous \\"facts\\" without ever stating how these \\"facts\\" were garnered. Was this through scientific methodology, his personal hunches or observations or something else entirely? It espouses that an attitude of scarcity creates opportunities for winners when most \\"real\\" thinkers espouse an attitude of abundance. It was not worth the short time it took the read this book! Don't bother.
B000002ITM|4.0|The Ritual seems to be the album that really bums out Testament fans and thrash fans. Perhaps I'm not a thrash metal fan after all, but I still marvel at some of the moments on this admittedly slower album by my favorite metal band of all time. Skolnick wrote a good portion of this album in major keys -- avoiding the typical minors that dominated metal of the time. The time signatures also slowed down, mostly due to his interest in complexity and layering. But it's hard for me to find things wrong with ELECTRIC CROWN, SO MANY LIES, THE RITUAL, DEADLINE, TROUBLE DREAMS, and the perfection of RETURN TO SERENITY, which includes the greatest solo Skolnick composed for the band.<br /><br />The filler has become more obvious to me over the years (The Sermon & Agony come to mind), but the heights they reached at a crucial point in their career impress me still. Don't listen to this and think it's the best example of Testament's work -- just appreciate what a band capable of true thrash can do when they slow it down a bit.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Its difficult to imagine Portishead's relevance in a new world where there are so many underground and mainstream trip-hop and ambient artists who are doing EXACTLY the same thing that the band once did. But then again, Portishead always did sound 'different' - indeed, this was one band that did not have to 'act' angsty or 'put on' a veneer of depression. I genuinely bought the sentiment that this was a very bleak, depressed band that produced some great music to slash your wrists to.<br /><br />By that token, their second self-titled album from aeons ago still holds up as the best thing they've recorded. If youre a new Portishead fan, you would do well to go out and get that record first before you listen to this one. Its seminal, groundbreaking, and largely forgotten, but I believe it deserves a wider audience even in this day and age. What is even more impressive is that it holds up to repeat listening for those cold, lonely nights when its just you and a good book. Classic.<br /><br />Which brings us to \\"Third\\". Going into this with minimal expectations, I noticed two things - 1) the band does not sound as gloomy as they once did, and 2) there are far more 'rock' elements on this CD, which renders it more toward the 'indie-rock' genre, or (dare I say this) the 'emo' genre. Depending on which way you swing, this may or may not be a good thing for you. As a staunch supporter of not boxing music down with labels, I found this approach to work while listening to 'Third'.<br /><br />First off, this is not a 'classic' album like their second album was. Sometimes an albums' hold upon you is associative, so you tend to be biased, but honestly, other than the opening track \\"Silence\\", I can't find anything here that holds up to their second album. There are a few great moments though. The wondrous track \\"Hunter\\" gives you the Portishead of the first album, and the charming (if somewhat ambiguous) \\"Deep Water\\" ends even before it starts (I would have loved to see them expand this into an eight-minute epic).<br /><br />There are a few mis-steps however. Fan favorite \\"We Carry On\\" didn't do much for me, and neither did the tedious \\"Machine Gun\\". But shockingly, these songs sound oh-so-different on your Ipod and your home theater system. Now this must be fairly obvious - the fact that music through headphones sounds different from music on your stereo playing loudly - but \\"Third\\" is a rare beast - if you have this on your Ipod or Itunes, I urge you to get a copy on CD and play this loudly - you will notice instruments that you will NOT over headphones (and the reverse is true). Its is only through this process that I actually began to appreciate what I thought was one of the weaker songs (\\"Machine Gun\\").<br /><br />\\"Third\\" may not be for everyone, and I'm giving it three and a half stars. The stark, dreary Portishead world is not one of hope - and you should be prepared for this. But if you can get past their gloominess, you will find that \\"Third\\" is actually more upbeat than some of their earlier stuff. However, if you're a new listener, please get their second album before you get this. Believe me, the music makes more sense that way.<br /><br />Recommended.minute epic).

B000002IPZ|3.0|Souls of Black was doomed.Topping Practice What You Preach would have required months of work and great, band-wide inspiration.<br /><br /> I'm sure there is a more complete story out on the interweb, but the basic story here is that Testament wanted to tour with Monsters of Rock, but their label support them for it without a new album top promote. Under a TIGHT deadline (i think it was less then 6 months, but it could be even less), the band threw together this album, which has some great moments, but lacks any real greatness, particularly in the normally brilliant solos. I recall interviews with the band after the Ritual came out where everyone admitted to the lack of inspiration being a result of having no time to really explore the songs. Sadly, there are some foundations for great songs here.

B001DTPZNY|3.0|Warning: Contains Spoilers    19 Years after Harrison Ford appeared as Henry Jones Jr. in the terribly scripted and interminably jokey 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade', we again are privy to another of his amazing adventures, this time in the slightly longer titled 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'. Hereafter referred to as \\"Crystal Skull\\".    This time out, part time teacher / super archeologist Indiana Jones (a great looking 65 year old Ford) is on the hunt for the mythic Eldorado, now called Akator and located in a Peruvian jungle. The reason Jones et al are traveling to this location is to find a secret inter-dimensional chamber and return the crystal skull of the title back to its natural resting place.    Along the road, Indy picks up the \\"Wild One\\" look-alike Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf) and even bumps into his old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), last seen going for a drink with Jones in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Another character from Indiana Jones' overly rich past is Professor Oxley (John Hurt) and his is picked up in the middle of the Jungle. All the secondary characters are there to provide some information or function, unlike Indy's other tag-along co-stars in the previous sequels. For instance \\"Ox\\" fills in much of the inevitable gaps that the script throws up and is a \\"get out of jail\\" card in a couple of occasions.    Not that Indiana Jones, or his friends, need the Oxley \\"get out of jail\\" card on their adventures as they always have an abundance of absurd luck, which increased in volume with each sequel. In fact, Jones and Co. possess so much luck that it's impossible to become excited about each new set piece that Spielberg lovingly creates for us and this has been one of the faults of the sequels of the Indiana Jones movies. With the exception of the first film, each of the sequels has progressively diluted the danger that the hero is exposed to. Of course, we all know that a hero like Jones (as mortal as he is) cannever die in the situations that he finds himself in, but this means that there is no sense of tension or real excitement involved in the various traps and fights he finds himself in. The audience also knows that nothing serious is ever going to happen to Mutt or Marion or Oxley either, as they're the \\"good guys\\". So each thrill ride loses its thrill very quickly.    The \\"bad guys\\", this time out, are the obvious choice of the Russians. Spielberg and Lucas, of course, couldn't resurrect their favorite whipping-boy, the Nazis, as Indy 4 is set during the 50's. So he has to make do with the next best thing...Russian Communists! Heading the red menace is the Louise Brooks bobbed Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), complete with scenery chewing \\"Ukrainian\\" accent, razor sharp rapier and figure hugging gray jumpsuit. In fairness, Blanchett's turn is a decent, if somewhat campy, comic-book villainess, all sharp movements and hard nosed, but the movie as a whole gains nothing from her character's inclusion. A big bunch of faceless Reds would have sufficed.    Spalko and the Commies are after the Crystal Skull and the subsequent being it comes from, because they believe that it holds great psychic power and like the Ark of the Covenant from 'Raiders', its possession would allow the user to achieve an offensive power that an enemy would find very difficult to resist.    So, it's off to various locations to battle things out in the usual chase scenes, scraps and fights. The showpiece of which is a spectacular pursuit through the jungle with jeeps, complete with a physics defying swordfight and a CGI Tarzan impression from LeBeouf. It's these CGI efforts, however, that expose the faults with the chase scenes in 'Crystal Skull'. Whereas, the truck chase scene in 'Raiders' was incredible (as in unreal), it was still grounded in reality, simply because it really was a man (stuntman Vic Armstrong) hanging on for dear life to the bottom of a truck sped down the dirt track in North Africa. Everything onscreen in that particular set piece is real because it was filmed within the limits of reality. The chase scene in 'Crystal Skull' looks and feels like it was created in a computer as the characters and vehicles involved defy logical physical constraints. It's a fault with CGI in general, not just with this movie. CGI, when used correctly, can be a wonderful addition to a film. But when it's used to help a character get from A to B in an unrealistic manner, as in LeBeouf.'s swing through the trees, it lets down the overall project...and I won't even mention a certain household electical appliance.    In its favor though, this chapter of Indy's adventures by and large does away with the terrible, terrible attempts at humour that were awkwardly inserted into the previous sequel. Gone are the insipid one-liners (for the most part anyway), the mind numbing \\"comedy\\" and the nonsensical slapstick. The result is a more satisfying movie in many respects.    The obvious question is, was it worth the wait?    Well...overall, sort of. I say overall, because there are many problems with the film, as there have been with all of the Indiana Jones sequels. Its plot is weaker than both 'Raiders' and 'Temple of Doom', but it's far superior to the 'Last Crusade'. The hokey coupling of psychic powers and X-Files induced Extra-Terrestrial beings cannot compete with the more down to earth stories of 'Raiders' and the 'Temple of Doom'. Apart from the super-natural ending of 'Raiders', for the most part the first two movies were grounded in realistic enough situations, so that the viewer didn't have to suspend disbelief too much. 'Crystal Skull' at times requires the viewer to switch off and just go with whatever is thrown at them, much like the 'Last Crusade', whose 700 year old Crusader Knight conclusion required some suspension of disbelief indeed.    The main enjoyment of the film though is derived from simply seeing an eternally memorable childhood hero back on the screen. It's a shame it's been 19 years between shows, but at the very least, 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' is a joyful two hour return for people who were around for the originals and is a semi-fitting entry for younger folk for whom Indiana Jones means as much as Tennessee Williams.
B0013J30XG|5.0|I have seen this movie 6 times and I'm going again this weekend !  I've heard the comments \\"Too long for little kids\\"  Too bad.  I've waited 30+ years for this movie and I don't care if 3 and 5 yr olds \\"don't get it\\".  As far as I'm concerned, it's not for them unless you've weaned them on all of the cartoon episodes first--to the point where they have most of them memorized like I do; and have since I was 7-8 years old!  I loved this movie.  To me, it was true to the cartoon; the bright colors, the basic dialogue, the 60's mod decor/fashions, the crazy villians, the family is all-important undertones; it is exactly what I expected and more.  You have to remember, this is a 'real-life' interpretation of a cartoon; it's not going to be some in-depth, complicated, fast-paced, plot-twisting, sex-infused drama.  You have to be a deep, true, SpeedRacer fanatic to really enjoy this movie.  If you're not, or just a luke-warm fan, it's not going to do it for you and you'll probably leave disappointed.

6305161992|4.0|About eight years ago, I posted a different, rosier review of “Showdown in Little Tokyo.” I was new to the B-movie martial arts scene and it was the first Dolph Lundgren vehicle I had ever watched, leading to a very favorable analysis of the movie, but after viewing many subsequent offerings of the same subgenre, my impression has become more balanced and critical. “Little Tokyo” is still a fun action outing and definitely among Lundgren’s best, but it hasn’t aged particularly well and has lost some of its ability to satisfy beyond the appreciation of turophiles.<br /><br />The story: Two renegade cops – played by Lundgren and Brandon Lee – investigating organized crime in Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo take on a deadly Yakuza faction.<br /><br />Disregarding any other entertainment value, the main reason for seeing the film is the team-up between Lundgren and Lee. The two have a degree of chemistry and are fun to watch, and it’s neat to see both of their distinctive styles of action play out within the same movie. However, even though Lee had just come off the dreadful [[ASIN:B00005A0Q9 Laser Mission]] and does well enough for himself here, their collaboration is definitely more to the benefit of Dolph, who plays the straight man to Lee’s comic relief and is presented as more culturally Asian than the character played by Bruce Lee’s son. This (potentially) unintentional display of vanity sets the tone for a level of goofiness throughout the film that fits well with the action standard of yesteryear but won’t necessarily appeal to viewers who have since learned that even comic book-style movies can be played seriously. Nothing against the script, but fewer jokes and less idolization of the archetypical action hero would have helped its legacy.<br /><br />The action content, focused on hand-to-hand fighting, is satisfying. This is probably the most martial arts that Lee performs in any movie other than [[ASIN:B000LC4Z7Q Rapid Fire]], and even Lundgren lives up to his “karate man” image better than usual. The fact that the cast and stunt ensemble are packed with action regulars – from James Lew to Gerald Okamura – makes it a little disappointing that more of the fight scenes aren’t showstoppers, but we get at least two pretty memorable bouts in the showdown between Lee and henchman Toshihiro Obata ([[ASIN:B0000C9JFS Rage and Honor]]) and the swordfight featuring Lundgren and supervillain Cary Tagawa ([[ASIN:B003ZHVJFK Tekken]]). Lundgren’s home invasion is likewise particularly satisfying as a rounded action scene, and the bath house brawl is memorable for several reasons. Retrospectively, it’s disappointing that future action heroine Tia Carrere ([[ASIN:B003XEKUBY Relic Hunter]]) is relegated to damsel here, but she does what she can with the role and is given the welcome opportunity to contribute to the soundtrack.<br /><br />I still recommend this one to action fans, though more as a means of getting in on some nostalgia than as witnessing an objectively great adrenaline vehicle. Even with all its faults, “Showdown in Little Tokyo” is worth an investment, and fans of either of the leading men will have an incomplete collection without this one.

B0000CDL93|1.0|The real shame of a movie like this is that so many viewers think it has some relationship to reality.    Don't get me wrong.  I happen to be one of those people who believes that the Warren Commission version of the Kennedy assassination is full of holes.  It's probable that Oswald was part of a large conspiracy, and that, in his own words, he was \\"a patsy.\\"    That does not mean, however, that Oliver Stone's paranoid fantasies have any basis in reality.      Jim Garrison, the character played by Kevin Costner, is a real person.  He was really the DA of New Orleans.  He really indicted prominent homosexual businessman Clay Shaw for conspiracy to murder John F. Kennedy.  After a legal persecution that lasted for about two years, culminating in a trial that took weeks, a jury of sensible adults acquitted Clay Shaw of all the charges against him.  They took less than an hour to review the paltry evidence before deciding in Shaw's favor.      In the years since the trial ended, gay rights organizations in New Orleans have erected plaques in various parts of the city commemorating Shaw's contribution to the city's economic growth.  He was a victim, pure and simple.  There was almost no evidence against him at all.     Garrison's entire career as DA might be looked at as one long publicity stunt.  Right after he got elected, he indicted his predecessor for malfeasance, but the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.  He staged a big crackdown on crime in the French Quarter, but got almost no convictions.  When he accused a bunch of judges of conspiring against him, they charged him with criminal defamation and won.  He accused the state parole board of accepting bribes, but couldn't even get an indictment.  Garrison was great at holding press conferences, but not so great at proving his numerous accusations.      In my own mind, there are two ways to view Jim Garrison.  One is that he was a glory-seeking opportunist.  The other is that he was a glory-seeking nutcase.  It is a travesty that any movie should be made about Garrison that features him as a hero.  In fact, he was a paranoid manipulator of the legal system who victimized an innocent man.  In the hands of an actor better than Costner, with a script that didn't sugar-coat the facts, this story about the wild ravings of a glory hound could have been a great comedy.
B00064MW6K|3.0|I feel sorry for the makers of \\"Catwoman\\": here they were, just trying to make a superhero/action film, but ended up being responsible for what's been considered one of the worst films ever made.<br />Okay, I'll come clean: \\"Catwoman\\", if judged against other superhero flicks, belongs on the rungs closer to \\"Daredevil\\" than \\"Batman\\", but despite the slapdash story, script, pacing, characters, and that godawful costume, I managed to enjoy it. You might too, if you're not a Catwoman loyalist (in which case, this movie gave you plenty to fume about)...<br /><br />Knock what you know of the DC character out of your head: Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a timid artist working for a cosmetics company, who is killed for uncovering the dangerous side-effects of her company's new product; mysteriously revived by the cat she saved earlier in the day, Patience comes to realize that she has acquired the physical powers (and traits) of a cat, and is quick to utilize them to bring down the launch of the dangerous new product.<br /><br />For this film, it's probably best to talk about its bad aspects first. To state the obvious, the movie is a commercial sellout: absolutely everything - from cutout characters to painfully-obvious plot twists - conforms to formulas you've seen a hundred times before, and offers nothing innovative. The action, while occasionally nifty, is almost entirely CGI or performed by a stunt double - Halle Berry never really lifts a finger. And where's the super-villain? - if you were expecting for any DC baddies, think again.<br />Oh, and the usually-amazing Frances Conroy (\\"Six Feet Under\\") gives the worst performance of her life as Opelia Powers; she looks like she's on crack.<br /><br />Still, for what it's worth, director Pitof (\\"Vidocq\\") does his darndest to keep the movie entertaining: with few interesting characters to work with, he keeps the film looking interesting with a stylized colour palette and camera angles. The swift cuts and editing will either keep your attention or give you a headache. Throw in some good CGI and decent, one-sided action scenes, and you can easily find yourself entertained for a single evening.<br /><br />Needless to say, this stand-alone adventure won't make you neglect Michelle Pfeiffer in \\"Batman Returns\\" or any of the femme fatale's previous outings, but as for being one of the worst films ever made, \\"Catwoman\\" falls short of the mark. Don't be prejudiced - give it a rent.ve you a headache. Throw in some good CGI and decent, one-sided action scenes, and you can easily find yourself entertained for a single evening.

1594489505|5.0|After reading this incredible tale, I will admit to having been completely ignorant as to the history and struggles of the people of Afghanistan.  I picked this one up on a recommendation and was hardly able to put it down, staying up till the early hours of the morning to finish it (yeah it's a page-turner).  Mr. Hosseini has accomplished a rare feat - a history lesson that is also an intense, gripping story.  In choosing to tell the story through the eyes (and thoughts) of two women - one \\"illegitimate\\" and uneducated, the other on a path towards great things until her life is derailed by events out of her control - Hosseini captures the changing dynamic of the Afghani political system and culture in a way that is relatable and evokes sympathy.  It is painful to experience Miriam's treatment as a second-class person by her own father due to her \\"illegitimate\\" birth, and to watch Laila's transformation from a bright and beautiful student in love with a childhood friend into an abused wife of an extremely violent, manipulative and domineering bully.  However, it is that which makes the ending all the more redemptive.  On a metaphorical level, the struggles of Miriam and Laila seem to parallel and represent those of Afghantistan itself - this, I believe, is Mr. Hosseini's central point.<br /><br />Admittedly these characters are somewhat one-dimensional and sometimes feel like caricatures painted in broad strokes.  Additionally, certain scenes are clearly written to tug at the heartstrings in a melodramatic manner (without giving too much away, the references to the movie \\"Titanic\\" are not misplaced with regards to Laila and Tariq, whose young relationship comes to border on the stuff of romance novels).  However, the strength of the storytelling and the sense of gritty reality overwhelm the simplicity or predictability of the characters' thoughts and actions to make a whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts.  This is a book to be taken in as wide-screen drama rather than picked apart in any great detail.  One gets the sense that this book will soon be made the basis of a successful film, which in this case is definitely not a bad thing - this story virtually screams for it.<br /><br />One final note - the violence in this book can be pretty graphic, so be warned if that kind of thing bothers you (for me, it just made the experience seem that much more real).  With that caution, I cannot recommend many books higher than this one.  It's an unflinching look into a world few Americans would ever know about if it were not for this fantastic author.rather than picked apart in any great detail.

B0015519VS|3.0|It is so easy to see that Usher is not the same young gigolo who danced, sang and rapped his way through his \\"My Way\\" video.  Usher exudes a certain maturity now that he is married with children and I am so glad I was able to see his transition.  Some have complained that he has lost his swagger and sexiness ever since he tied the knot, but I do not share their opinion.  Usher is still as sexy as he ever was; he's just a full-fledged adult at this juncture.  My only gripe is that he couldn't work it out with Chilli, but that's another story (I love you, Chilli!)<br /><br />Usher is singing his behind off on this album!  He always has a nice vocal delivery, but he has never sounded this good, this mature, this happy. \\"Here I Stand\\" is a fine piece of work but it is a lengthy album (1.2 hours, eighteen tracks) and it is just not as consistent as I would like it to be.  Don't misinterpret me, though.  There isn't one bad song on here.  Rather, there are average moments and then there are highlights.  The lyrics on this album help make it even better.  I also enjoyed the production.  There are ballads, mid-tempos and faster songs and just about an even distribution of each, fortunately.  The first song released to radio was the smash hit \\"Love in This Club\\" which features Young Jeezy.  It took many lots of listens in order to truly get into this song, but it is one of those songs that you will like at least a little with time.  This song's remix is also included and features Beyonce' and Lil' Wayne.  Although I really revel in the talents of all three artists, the remix was bland and the original is better.  \\"This Ain't Sex\\" is one of the finest moments found on this album.  His energy on this track is undeniable and so is the magnificent production.  \\"Moving Mountains\\", \\"Appetite\\" and \\"What is A Man to Do\\" are all decent tracks, but they don't bring this album out.  \\"Moving Mountains\\" is a ballad which gives off the same eerie feel that Omarion's \\"Icebox\\" gives off.<br /><br /> This is not one that needs to be pondered upon.  Purchase this album yesterday!

0380713802|4.0|In this book, Bill Bryson embarks on the grown-up version of backpacking across Europe.  Having wandered Europe twenty years previously with a friend named Katz, he revisited some places and observes how they have changed.<br /><br />Bryson has the idea of starting at Hammerfest, in far northern Norway, and then working his way south to Rome.  Because he wants to see the northern lights, his journeys begin in winter, when the Arctic is still dark and, of course, cold.  The northern lights don't appear to him for a couple of weeks, so the book begins at a leisurely pace, with Bryson hanging out in a dark, cold city where there really isn't much for a tourist to do.<br /><br />Moving south from Hammerfest gives Bryson many cold, rainy days in Copenhagen and Stockholm before he can't take it any more and goes to Italy.  From there he hops from one city to another, ending in Sofia, Bulgaria.  His slower pace in the first part of the book gave him many opportunities to talk about the people in each place; in Italy, his observations tend to focus on the physical plant instead.  When he gets to Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, however, his observations tun personal again.<br /><br />Oddly enough, Bryson's most pithy observations are about the people but he doesn't spend much time meeting them.  He comes across as a loner who is happiest wandering the streets of an unfamiliar city, visiting the museums, and then having a large number of beers at the end of the day.  That strategy means that he risks making unfamiliar generalizations about the people around him, so it's remarkable that his observations don't necessarily jibe with the stereotypes.  However, he doesn't pass up a stereotype if he can make a good joke.<br /><br />Bryson is at his best when on the road less-traveled, from Hammerfest to Sofia, and he doesn't have much to say about the Romes of the world.  He's a gifted writer, and it's a pleasure to accompany him.
B00000JGHM|5.0|I don't know I missed seeing this terrific film when it first came out, but somehow I did. It's a brilliantly written, beautifully acted, deeply involving cops and robbers story, starring Al Pacino as police Lt. Vincent Hanna, a loud-mouthed sleuth with an ex-wife (and a not-happy current spouse) who always gets his man, and Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley, extremely skilled professional heist man. Both are rather thoughtful and analytical and there's a great scene where they sit down in a coffee shop and wax philosophical about their antagonistic relationship. The scene in which the good guys are surveiling the bad guys, only to discover that they are being examined through binoculars in turn, is also first rate. Val Kilmer plays a thoroughly scary shooter -- who, quite unexpectedly, appears to escape in the end. There are numerous interpersonal relationships, between Kilmer and his long-suffering wife (Ashley Judd) who warns him away, between Hanna and his wife and his messed-up stepdaughter (Natalie Portman), and between McCauley and a completely innocent bystander whom he comes to care for but whom he is also willing to leave behind on thirty seconds notice. All the numerous supporting roles are also very nicely done.
B0015519VS|4.0|I'm not writing this as one of Usher's devout fans. I have watched him grow up and develop over his career. With so many new artists (Chris Brown, Mario, Omarion etc..) Attempting to dethrone Usher, he had to come strong this time out. I was fortunate to preview 30 tracks of pre-released material before  the final product was due for release. The first two tracks that stuck out in my mind were His Mistakes and Moving Mountains. Upon hearing his mistakes the first thing that came to my mind was this sounds like something Ne-yo would sing. I later discovered that Ne-yo had written the track. This is a good thing because not to many of today's writers can tell a story of a relationship the way that Ne-yo does. The second track that I really liked was Moving Mountains. This song is really deep and full of substance. Anyone that has ever ended a relationship can relate the feelings of \\" standing in gas and you have been the flames.\\" I'm not sure if this song is produced by timbaland but, it does has the same production feel as I apologize does. I think both of these songs will stand out and carry this album .
B0001US62I|5.0|\\"Angel Heart\\" will not only leave you feeling terrified; it will leave you sick, afraid, and wanting to take three hot showers to get the grime off your soul.  The hallmark of a great film: one that you see as a youngin and that sticks in your mind till you see it 13 or 14 plus years later.  And wow, did this one stick.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke (appropriately) is fantastic as Harold Angel (aka...find out for yourself)  who is hired by a very eloquent, ponytailed individual with a knack for seeing through bulls**t.  And wow, does he.  Robert DeNiro is Satan himself, and he pays Angel very well to discover the whereabouts of a man who is closer to home than one might think.  One the way he encounters some really interesting things: gorgeous voodoo mambo priestesses sacrificing chickens, a blues band which plays very well but does odd stuff between songs, doctors who fill Bibles with bullets and shoot dope all day, palm readers who have strange accessories--real strange--and finally the inescapable grip of a hellish, perverse fate.  This is subtle, disgusting, creepy, surreal, poetic, and occult all over.  Any lover of horror has got to check this out.
0316067601|4.0|I wasn't in the mood to read a war story but I had heard Marcus Luttrell on the radio and wanted more details of his story.  I bought his book quite a while ago and didn't pick it up until recently and literally couldn't put it down.  I'm a woman who doesn't read war stories very often at all (Band of Brothers is the only one I can think of off the top of my head) but this one really intrigued me.  It really explained in more detail situations I never knew, and I've known quite a few military personnel.      At the beginning Luttrell is in the present but then he goes back to his intense training, even that he has wanted to be a Navy SEAL since childhood.  He has quite a wry sense of humor that is hidden at times and made me laugh out loud more than once.  (Like how he could wrestle alligators and snakes but dealing with snow for the first time about killed him.) I'm from snow country so that's funny to me!      When Luttrell was explaining how the Afghans dealt with daily life, that was quite intriguing.  I would never have known that and I found it very interesting how he combined a military book with a short history lesson while still keeping the story.      My only complaint was that in the middle of the book the language got a little rough.  Okay, quite rough.  Military, right?  Not necessary.      In any case, this book was worth the read.  I've recommended it to many people and my own personal copy now has a waiting list.
B00102FELM|5.0|Of all the Scorpions concerts that have been captured on film, this one is the absolute best. All of the guys in the band look very fit, very happy, and very capable from the very first song. The music sounds great, and the huge crowd of 60,000 German fans are in high spirit throughout the performance. As an added bonus, there are guest appearances by Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker, Herman Rarebell, and Tyson Schenker. The show rolls on for over two hours, as the band performs a gigantic playlist of songs that span three decades of Scorpions music. Believe me, this is a really great live show that you will want to watch again and again. I have been lucky enough to see the Scorpions play live in Rotterdam, Holland. It was a such a great show, and this new DVD brings back a lot of memories for me. The Scorpions are still Rocking, and doing it WELL!

I didnt like The confessions one either, but at least Hung up was fun and catchy. I hope she use her old formula of good lyrics, variety of sounds and controversy with the modern style...I hope next album.
0060935464|5.0|This timeless novel by Harper Lee is a semi-autobiographical story about a girl named Scout Finch growing up in 1930's Alabama. When her father, Atticus, is assigned to defend a black man on trial for rape, Scout must learn to keep her head high in spite of the taunting and threats of a town gone \\"stark raving mad\\". Scout's brother, Jem, represents adolescence and its uncertainty, while her friend, Dill, provides a more naïve and straightforward point-of-view; with Scout's tenacity they form a balanced perspective on the discord that surrounds them. Their distant communication and friendship with the hermit Boo Radley teaches Scout that people are not always who they appear to be.    The first-person narration by Scout as an adult is effective in making the reader feel like he or she has truly lived the story, and in allowing adults, as well as kids, to relate to the theme of growing up while facing adversity.  Atticus, truly the model father, shows through example the values of courage, honesty, and respect. The different ways that Scout, Jem, and Dill, respond to the injustices they witness allow for great insight into the human character. To Kill a Mockingbird is known as a high-school staple for its message of courage and tolerance, but readers of all ages have been and will continue to be impacted by this poignant narrative.

0061537934|5.0|In Mongolia, many believe dogs can return as humans in a future incarnation, but only after they've lived enough times to accumulate the right amount of cosmic grace.     Enzo doesn't live in Mongolia, but if ever there's been a dog who is ready, Enzo is the one. Already, he's practically human; he knows the world (from watching cable documentaries and news shows), and has learned how to be honorable by watching his owner Denny, whose dream is to become a top race car driver, turn away from choices that would advance his dream in order to support his family. Enzo believes in Denny, who like Enzo himself, only needs a chance to show just how exceptional he is.     But Enzo has also learned that racing isn't only about driving on dry, flat tracks. Nor does the next corner always reveal what we expect. Sometimes it rains, and things go badly wrong. When it rains, only the very best manage to stay on the track and win their way through.     That's why when rain begins to fall into Denny's world, Enzo never doubts his master for a moment. He's there, and he will do his part to help Denny make it through.    As you would expect, Enzo's observations tend to be simple, and the underlying theme and moral of his viewpoint remain visible just below the surface. Sometimes we tend to over-express when putting into words the principles we strive to live by. All the better for us because this is a mistake Enzo doesn't make. His conclusions are more powerful and poignant for their simplicity and as the overall theme is drawn toward the inevitable end point, the fact that we had a pretty good idea where things were going and were afraid for both Enzo and Denny while hoping and praying for the best, makes what happens all that much more satisfying.    The Art of Racing in the Rain is an enthralling, uplifting, and beautifully imagined story. Five stars for all readers.    Art Tirrell is the author of the 2007 adventure [[ASIN:1601640048 The Secret Ever Keeps]].  \\"Simpy put...the bestunderwater scenes I've ever read.\\" - reviewer Meg Westley

B000002ITM|1.0|1992 was a tough year to swallow for Metal Fans. I am not talking about the birth of Grunge, because that didnt really bury Metal, it just took Metal to new horizons with bands such as SoundGarden, Nivana, and Pearl Jam. What really killed great Thrash Bands was the rise of Hair Metal which really took off in 1991 and was still hanging on by a thread in 1992. Even though not all bands crossed over to that sound, most of the great Thrash Metal acts of the 1980's such as Metallica, Overkill, Exodus, Megadeth, and Anthrax were either left for dead or released albums that were sub-par to their earlier works, as it seemed these bands, all on major label, were trying to cross over into the pop metal world. Testament was another that fell victim to these time period, and the god awful \\"The Ritual\\" doesnt even deserve to have the Testamens name on it. This album is a joke folks. From the first track, you swear that you were listening to Winger or White Lion with weak lyrical content and music that was dreadful slow and very forgettable. The only two tracks on the album that even have an edge to them are the title track, even though its slow, it is downtuned enough to give Testament some rawness here, and \\"Agony\\" The rest is just garbage, and boy can we tell that the record company influenced Testament to release this garbage of an album. It was bad enough that Metallica' Black Album and Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction were lacking the fericoty of the bands older material, but this album is a joke. I am glad that this was the only stinkbomb the band made, and they were able to put this garbage behind them. Avoid this one at all cost. Get anything from Testament but this.

It contains all the songs, and enough re-inactment of the musical that I felt as if I was watching Les Miserables again. There is a tremendous finale followed by a performance from 17 different Jean Val Jean(s) from various countries!    The DVD offers the viewer the ability to pull the lyrics up on the screen or turn them off. You have the ability to jump from Act I to Act II. You may also view by song title and go straight to that song to view from that point forward (or jump around). It is remarkable!    I could not ask for more!!

0946535256|5.0|For some reason Amazon treats all books in this series as if they were the same regardless of whether they are for sax, trumpet, clarinet, flute, etc.<br /><br />To avoid confusion, let me say that this review is for the trumpet version of the book.  But even if you are interested for one of the other books in the series I hope that this review will at least give you some flavour of the way the series have been designed.  I expect that the overall concept is the same.<br /><br />This is actually the first trumpet book I bought at the time I started playing trumpet close to three years ago and it seemed tailor-made for me as an adult learner with a great love of jazz.  Now I'm playing trumpet in a jazz quintet so I am definitely doing something right and I really think this book was a significant help.<br /><br />I have never seen another book that covers so much ground nor one that has such interesting material for the beginner. You won't find any childish nursery rhymes or 18th century folk songs here!<br /><br />It really does start from the absolute beginner level, even to the point of telling you how to hold the trumpet and get your first sounds.  At the same time, from the very first tune you are playing jazz.  Most of the earlier pieces were written by the authors, but the later tunes are mainly by jazz greats, and usually trumpet players.  You'll find tunes from great jazz trumpeters like Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Kenny Dorham, Woody Shaw, Freddie Hubbard, Kenny Wheeler etc.<br /><br />There are also some tunes from other jazz instrumentalists but the trumpeters are the clear majority in this edition (presumably the incarnations of this book made for other instruments mainly contain tunes relevant to their instrument).<br /><br />As the book progresses you will gradually add notes to your range, learn about jazz articulation, how to use mutes, useful jazz theory, improvisation, biographical information about jazz trumpeters, pedal tones (that's notes below the conventional range), high range playing (that's notes above high C), alternate fingerings and more.<br /><br />I think that even a reasonably advanced player could benefit from some of the later sections. There is also a nice CD with the book which demonstrates how all the songs should sound and has a split track so you can play along with the rhythm section.<br /><br />Of course it's not the only book you will ever need, however this book is a fine place to start and it contains references to many of the other books (and recordings) you may want as you progress.(that's notes above high C), alternate fingerings and more.

B000Q6GUTI|4.0|After a mission gone awry, Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) now leads a solitary existence in the mountains of Wyoming. When he is called back to assist a covert military group (headed by Danny Glover) in determining how to pull off an assasination attempt, he soon discovers that he's been set up in an elaborate ruse to take the fall. Hell hath no fury like a Marine scorned, and Swagger becomes a PO'ed two-man army (once he hooks up with disgraced FBI agent Michael Pena), determined to bring the real culprits to justice. Directd by Antoine Fuqua (\\"Training Day\\"), this high octane conspiracy thriller just doesn't let up and will keep the viewer guessing. Though it's pretty violent - it's well worth watching!<br /><br />My only drawback was having to hear Glover's dialogue - was it me or did he have some really ill-fitting dentures that provided him with the most annoying lisp. I was just waiting for them to fall out. Overall though, Glover has not given a more chilling performance since \\"Witness,\\" and Wahlberg who can also be pretty menacing, proves to be a great action hero.<br /><br />The DVD extras include a great behind the scenes segment featuring the technical advisor, himself a former military sniper, who provides insight into that occupation as well as the weapons used in the movie.
B000000HZT|5.0|Genesis keyboard player Tony Banks released his first solo album entitled A Curious Feeling in October of 1979.<br />The A Curious Feeling album came about what turned out to be an unexpected break for the band Genesis. This came to pass after lead singer/drummer Phil Collins' first marriage literally crumbled. Whilst Phil tried to salvage his marriage and couldn't, Banks and Genesis guitarist/bass player Mike Rutherford each went off and recorded their first solo albums.<br />A Curious Feeling came out four months before Rutherford's Smallcreep's Day (released in February of 1980). Like Rutherford's album, Banks had used producer/engineer David Hentschel and recorded it at ABBA's Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. However, unlike Rutherford's album, Tony handled all of the bass guitar, keyboards and guitar parts and very well I may add. Banks is joined by Genesis' longtime touring drummer (the ever wonderful) Chester Thompson and singer Kim Beacon handles all of the vocals.<br />This is a great solo debut for Banks and, of all his solo albums, A Curious Feeling is the most progressive-rock sounding and the most like vintage Genesis-sounding of all of Banks' solo efforts.<br />Tony delivers eleven superb tracks at fifty minutes and has three instrumentals (the stellar opening \\"From The Undertow\\", the exquisite \\"Forever Morning\\" and the truly gorgeous \\"Waters Of Lethe\\").<br />There are also great melodic and nice pieces like the single \\"Lucky Me\\" (which went sadly nowhere) and the superb title cut (the song that sent me looking for the album in the first place).<br />There's also brilliant progressive tracks like the powerful \\"Somebody Else's Dream\\" and the album's centerpiece by a longshot called \\"You\\" which begins as a ballad before seguing into a Genesis-style instrumental break that hits you in the heart.<br />The other tracks \\"Lie\\" and \\"After the Lie\\" and the closing one-two punch of \\"For a While\\" and \\"In the Dark\\" which are all stellar numbers as well.<br />A Curious Feeling (like the solo albums from Rutherford and Steve Hackett before him) failed to make an impact when released peaking in the lower rungs of the Billboard 200 but a great album NEVERTHELESS regardless of sales and so forth!<br />RECOMMENDED!olo albums from Rutherford and Steve Hackett before him) failed to make an impact when released peaking in the lower rungs of the Billboard 200 but a great album NEVERTHELESS regardless of sales and so forth!

Whilst Phil tried to salvage his marriage, Rutherford and Genesis keyboard player Tony Banks recorded solo albums.<br />Banks' A Curious Feeling was released in October of 1979 and Smallcreep's Day came a few months later.<br />Like Banks' album, Rutherford had producer/engineer David Hentschel and recorded it at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Unlike Banks' album, Rutherford had a stellar band featuring a reunion with original Genesis guitarist (and Charterhouse schoolmate) Anthony Phillips on keyboards, drummer Simon Phillips (whom up until 1980 had only appeared on Judas Priest's Sin After Sin album before playing with Pete Townshend later in the 1980s), percussionist Morris Pert from Collins' jazz-fusion group Brand X and an excellent singer in Noel McCalla.<br />The first side of the original US edition of the album (either that or side 2 of the UK issue) kicks off with the great rocker \\"Moonshine\\" and what a song. The riff just rocks out BIG TIME and the vocals ROCK! Next is the great ballad \\"Time and Time Again\\" that will give you goose bumps. Next is \\"Romani\\" which is another great song that tells of the gypsy train of thought, but the main feature has to be the never-ending keyboard line with very well-played guitar lines. \\"Every Road\\" is next and another winning ballad and proves that ballads can have many moods and not ever lose intensity. The first half (or side two of UK issue and/or CD itself) ends with the rocker \\"Overnight Job\\" which is another great piece.<br />The 26-minute 7-part title suite took up either the first side of the UK release or second side of US vinyl release (take your pick). The first part \\"Between The Tick and The Tock\\" has no drums, but who needs them with such rich, well-voiced chords and melodies and guitar synths. Part two is \\"Working In Line\\" which has few lyrics but Rutherford's great guitar solo compensate in spades. Part three is \\"After Hours\\" which is a calming interlude. Part four is \\"Cats and Rats (In This Neighbourhood)\\" and is a nice section. Part five which is \\"Smallcreep Alone\\" is another calming interlude, but with more urgency. It segues into Part six which is the superb \\"Out Into The Daylight,\\" a very intense guitar solo that doesn't rest along with Phillips' powerhouse drumming (I can see why people like Judas Priest and The Who and later Toto always wanted to work with Simon) which ends like a piece from Mike's day job \\"Supper's Ready\\". The suite concludes with the beautiful \\"At The End Of The Day\\" is another one of Rutherford's great ballads, rivalling his best ballads from Genesis (\\"Throwing It All Away,\\" \\"Your Own Special Way,\\" and \\"Taking It All Too Hard,\\" just to name a few) and the music is so beautiful that you could shed tears of joy to it.<br />Smallcreep's Day sadly was ignored when released and peaked in the lower rung of The Billboard 200.<br />The album was re-released last year and is available at the Official Genesis store and if you have to pay the money, do so as it is a GREAT ALBUM and Rutherford's best solo effort.<br />HUGELY RECOMMENDED!ords and melodies and guitar synths.

B0013D8LOK|5.0|While the original stage production, directed by David Merrick, was unforgetable and a Broadway milestone, Tim Burton's film adaptation is equally, if not more so, stunning. Depp is frighteningly intense as Sweeney. Helena Bohnam Carter is her own impeccable Mrs. Lovitt. As the tale on film moves to its inexorable, Greek-tragedy conclusion, it becomes almost too tense to sit through. Cringe and endure it.  Magnificent. Only downside, all the choral music from the score has been deleted, perhaps to make the film seem less like the stage.  However, sad, for the choral music was part of the musical's glory. \\"Sweeney\\" is Sondheim's masterpiece and remains so on film.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Wes Anderson directs this movie about three brothers on a spiritual journey.  In true comedy form, we get to see the brotherly love and jealously that siblings often have for each other.  I knew this was going to be a wonderful comedy, but what always takes me aback is the soulful humanity that is in Wes Anderson movies.  Once again we get to see Owen Wilson, Bill Murray (in a cameo), Jason Schwartzman, and Anjelica Huston.  But we also see the great Adrien Brody playing one of the three brothers. While your laughing, you just might be surprised to find tears falling.  This is a wonderful film to share with family.
0312995423|1.0|It would be easier to explain \\"What Dan Brown got right\\" rather than to list things he got wrong...    The characters are completely ridiculous in this story. They are supposedly very intelligent but every step of the way they act like dimwits. Especially Susan (main character), who is relegated to expository device for the benefit of the challenged reader. Don't tell me your heroine is a genius and then show her constantly confused and overwhelmed by the simplest of concepts, just so someone can can try to explain technobabble nonsense to her (=the reader). That's hack writing if I ever saw it.    I wonder why everyone is calling her a young woman though? In my copy she is said to be 38 years old? Is this a misprint? I mean, it would surely explain a few things if she is really supposed to be 18 years old instead. And if we drop her IQ about 100 points from the stated 170, things really start to fall into place...    The plot itself is a swiss cheese. It makes your head hurt if you try to backtrace later. Very little makes sense.    Locations (Spain and NSA building) are obviously inventions of Dan Brown's mind and not based on reality, but they are not really that exciting either.    Let's just not talk about the main backdrop (computers and cryptography), even though Mr.Brown himself has compulsive masochistic tendencies to draw attention to his nonsense inventions.    And the supposed linguistic genius repeats some folk-etymology (\\"without wax\\") and have mastered \\"six asian dialects\\". Dialects? More correct to say Spanish, Italian, and French are dialects, than to suggest Chinese Mandarin and Japanese are dialects...And he knows Kanji language, hehehe.     One hilarious blooper is that Mr.Brown claims that Shichigosan is \\"the seven deities of good luck\\". Shichi-go-san literally means seven-five-three and is a celebration of children of these ages held on November 15th. I think someone was pulling his leg. Maybe the same people as the so-called \\"ex-NSA agents\\" (prankstering kids most likely).
1582701709|2.0|I borrowed both the audiobook and film version of The Secret.  After watching and listening to The Secret, I have placed a request to the \\"Genie\\" of the Universe.  Please let me win the Michigan Millionaire's Raffle.  I can picture myself with more than enough money and in turn, generously offering more than a tithe to family, friends, and charities.  I certainly can visualize a new car, no mortgage, all those student loans repaid, and a closetful of Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, and Ralph Lauren clothes.  As promised, green-causes, charities, and relatives will receive an abundant allocation.<br /><br />Okay, well if this really happens ('cause God knows I want to believe it will), I will write another review and share with the world that The Secret really works.<br /><br />Meanwhile, let me offer a few thoughts about The Secret. I believe that positive thinking can buffer life's \\"slings and arrows.\\"  I'm all for programs that encourage positive thinking--not to the point where you deny legitimate feelings of loss and anger, but to the point where you can frame your life experiences in such a way that you can cope with whatever comes your way.<br /><br />I think that expectations are important.  Without becoming delusional and irrational, you can expect things to work out and plan for a successful completion of personal goals.  Well and good.  The Secret and I are still on the same page.<br /><br />Okay, here's where I'm turning to a different page.  I only have so much control.  Susan Jeffers, a self-help guru, helped her readers navigate the \\"Let go, let God,\\" and \\"I can only control my reaction\\" personal philosophy.  While I'm loved and valued by a higher power, I can't control many of my own life's circumstances, much less the Universe at large.  The Secret reassures you that once you know how to apply (hush) \\"Le Secret,\\" that the Universe will rearrange itself for you. Your wish is its command.  The Aladdin legend is an extension of The Secret, hence the genie reference at the beginning of the review.  According to The Secret, you have enormous power not only over your own life, but over the entire known (Stephen Hawking-has-yet-to-map) Universe.  This feeling of empowerment beats the victimhood mindset, but this sense of control could be misapplied.<br /><br />Byrne implies that victims of the Holocaust and natural catastrophes unwittingly played into their own demise. Their worst fears were realized, and this mass expectation (unconscious or conscious) sent out that collective negative energy into the Universe. Byrne directly asserts that you don't have to age or get sick.  That's just the wrong energy frequency sent out into the Universe.  If someone is sick, well, tell them The Secret and see cancer defied and the hands of time reversed.<br /><br />Okay, some good and bad points about this book, DVD, promotional materials.  Yes, positive thinking helps you cope with whatever curve ball you are thrown.  Great (but realistic) expectations can foster self-confidence in a cyclic relationship.<br /><br />No, I only have so much control.  I can choose how I react to whatever curve ball life throws me.  I can pray and hope for the best (I'd really like to win the Michigan Millionaire's Raffle; I'd really love World Peace; and I'd love to see an end to hunger, disease, and animosity). I volunteer with community meals, have signed petitions for stem-cell research (a potential goldmine for disease research), I'm voting for the Democratic candidate, and I pray a lot)---those are things that I can do to help the Universe within my limits.<br /><br />No, the victim shouldn't be blamed because they were tuned in to the wrong frequency.  They should be empathized with and taught coping skills. Instead of just thinking \\"thin\\" thoughts, people can learn to make healthier food choices and incorporate exercise into their daily routine.<br /><br />Yes, we can visualize what we want and send out positive energy. We can begin to attract into our life what we want and not what we don't want to a certain extent. The extent of control that The Secret promises is controversial at best, and delusional at worst. But if I win the Millionaire's Raffle, I will happily recant any doubt of The Secret and will \\"rumor mill\\" The Secret to all who will listen. I will realize how powerful positive thinking (taken to the upteenth level) can be in our lives.ertain extent.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|Many people complained that the DVD they ordered did not include the David Bowie introduction they loved as children.  Having seen both introductions, I can't really say that one is better than the other.  I grew up with the Raymond Briggs introduction (which happens to be the original).  I purchased the DVD here in the hopes that I would get the same \\"wrong\\" introduction so many people have complained about, and Amazon is still selling DVDs with Raymond Briggs, despite the product description.  There also used to be a version of this film in which \\"Walking in the Air\\" only appeared as an instrumental in the film.  Fortunately, this DVD does include Peter Auty's performance in the movie.      Two things on a technical note: the film starts with an aspect ration note: \\"This film has been modified from it's original version.  It has been formatted to fit this screen.\\"  I'm not sure why it says that.  This film has only ever been full screen (it was made for TV in 1982, so there was no widescreen audience to cater to).  When you see this message, don't worry that your DVD has been modified in any way.  It couldn't be any closer to the original release in 1982.  Also, you might experience some trouble if you try to play the DVD on your XBox 360.  The audio would not play on mine.  I'm not sure if it's a problem with my XBox, or with XBoxes in general, but I tried several times, and the audio never worked on the XBox.  It worked flawlessly on my DVD player and on my roommate's computer, however.    Finally, the movie; there's not much to say that hasn't already been said.  It truly is a brilliant classic.  The animation is amazing, the story is wonderful, and the soundtrack is incredible.  This is a Christmas special you will want to watch AT LEAST once every Christmas.  Don't worry about the reviews that say it has a sad ending.  It's really a matter of opinion - I'd call it bittersweet.  Either way, it's the best way to end the story.

B00005LC1H|5.0|In this spectacular BritCom, Monty Python's John Cleese stars as a disgruntled hotel owner named Basil Fawlty.  He cowrote the show with then-wife Connie Booth, who plays the maid, Polly Sherman.  Cleese and Booth divorced after Season 1, and it took a while 'til they could work together again to write and star in Season 2.  After that, they could not work together anymore, and it's a real shame that only 2 seasons of this brilliant comedy was ever made.  Prunella Scales plays Fawlty's wife, Sybill, a bit of a shrew who always has more important things to do than helping to run the hotel.  And Andrew Sachs plays the mousy Spanish bellhop, Manuel, who tries to be a good employee, but his efforts are hampered by the fact that he doesn't speak English.  Basil is short-tempered, rude to the guests, trying to raise the hotel's standards while remaining cheap and overall, unpleasant.  Guests range from brazen French women, obnoxious Americans, people who think their dogs are people, senile retired Army Majors, confidence tricksters, old ladies who complain about everything but refuse to turn on their hearing aids, and people who have the nerve to die in bed overnight.  Also they have to deal with hotel inspectors, drunken gay gourmet chefs, snobs, incompetent builders/construction workers and the health department...not to mention a psychiatrist, and even Germans!  Every episode is a classic!  This is truly one of the best and funniest sitcoms ever made anywhere on the planet!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B00005JM02|5.0|What's not to like in this fantastic under the sea adventure? Beautiful animation, colorful characters and a great story! The Ocean is illustrated as a beautiful, but very scary place in this wonderful animated film. Disney has got to be responsible for more children's nightmares than any other movie studio. In the first minutes 'Marlin'(Nemo's father)witnesses his wife... if you will and 399 of his offspring eaten by a sea predator!<br />This film does have some very tense moments that I think are a little too much for younger viewers, but it's a really good movie that should be seen by all...especially if you like animated films. The 2 disc set is loaded with extras and has a great DVD transfer and sound!
B00171NZE4|3.0|I didnt really realise when buying this that it wasnt per say a actual 'korn made' dvd, but a release buy the fesitival/dvd company etc. But regardless of that it is a very well produced concert!    Super clean video and high quality 5.1 sound.  The concert itself would be a 4 / 4.5 for setlist/sound and video quality etc    The only reason i felt it warrents 3stars is because of the complete lack of any special features, some backstagestage or interveiws or something like that would have added to the dvd.    As far as the concert goes, i think that if you have seen korn before, or own any other of the Korn dvds then this is in no way essential korn.  But for the keen fan it is a well producted concert with a good (yet fairly predicatable) setlist.

B000WQWPKA|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite big-budget action movies - but the my review isn't in regard as to weather this is your kind of movie or not. The transfer is wonderful. The bitrate stays consistently at 30Mbps (BLU-RAY)and upwards of 40Mbps - if I recall correctly. Although, the video does show some grain and artifacts occasionally - like during the dark scenes, open sky, or just the desert sand. I only notices these imperfections on a 70-inch(at 1920x1080). On my 50+inch plasma (at 1360x768), the transfer was unbelievably sharp. A must buy, since I got it at Amazon for less than $15.

6305558175|5.0|[[ASIN:6305558175 Sommersby]]  Set in the aftermath of the Civil War, Jack Sommersby (Richard Gere) returns, after about six years, to the town of Vine Hill, Tennessee, to find his plantation and house devastated by the ravages of war.  Additionally, he encounters his beautiful  wife Lauren Sommersby (Jodie Foster), who is actually engaged to another fellow. Sommersby returns as a completely different, loving, working, and caring person, and makes everyone believe he is back. In fact, his romantic relationship with Lauren achieves its most sublime point.  He convinces the town to grow tobacco to get out of the wreckage and devastation and is quite successful at that.  He even sells pieces of land to dark people to work with.    Everything seems fine until the moment that he is arrested and sent to trail for supposedly killing a man. At this precise moment, his identity is utterly challenged.  He is hypothetically not Jack Sommersby, but some other murderer called Townsend.  Judie Foster does a superb job at trying to convince the Judge and the Jury that he is not in fact her husband giving away even intimate details.  However, Jack himself does the contrary since for him his love for his children and wife and the honor involved are more important than life itself.    I am not about to convey the end of the story. I will only say that this is a great DVD to watch and will leave you wondering who is Jack Sommersby indeed.    By the way, the performances of Richard Gere and Judie Foster are both outstanding, and this is a DVD that you will never forget until the end of your life!

1593080255|5.0|While this is Oscar Wilde's only foray into novel-writing, I must say it is justifiably called a classic.  The use of descriptive language and mood is exquisite.<br /><br />The only downsides that I can mention would be how slowly it moves in some spots.  Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot.  Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring.  Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest.  It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology.  In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest.  Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.<br /><br />That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts.  In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from.  As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale.  I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it.  Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.<br /><br />The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach.  Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror.  Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up!  If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that.  Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.<br /><br />Happy Reading!y who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror.

B000YIGNKE|2.0|The fact that the cast is better looking in this '08 version cannot make up for the complete meltdown of the story in the second half of this version. The first half of the movie is true to the book.  Once Anne arrives in Bath, the story strays away from Jane Austen's novel. Anne's friend Mrs. Smith and her vital role is completely diminished and you barely even realize who she is, since she isn't an invalid in this movie either. Also one of my favorite parts of this whole story is skipped, Wentworth doesn't ever write Anne a hurried letter containing his true feelings. I don't understand why they couldn't have tacked on 20 more minutes and made this version live up to Austen's novel. Very poor adaptation!
B00006LI4S|5.0|Attention, Floydians: This album is a MUST HAVE. It's one of the best-produced concert videos I've ever seen. The feeling is one of an intimate performance - you are there. It must have been filmed by a musician, because attention is paid to the finger mechanics and gives a feeling of the production as a whole. Nice variety of camera angles and orientation toward the performers. The sound quality is excellent. And, of course, Gilmour is awesome. If this video doesn't raise goosebumps, have your pulse checked.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I only just discovered Jane Austen's novel Persuasion. After reading it I watched  the '08 movie version of Persuasion first and was supremely disappointed with that adaptation. I was delighted to see that this '95 version got it right! It followed Austen's novel and flowed very well. While I think Amanda Root and Ciran Hinds acted beautifully (along with the rest of the cast) I think they were a little old for the roles which could be my only criticism. Other than that I was delighted that a version true to the book was out there. The costumes and the scenery were just as I imagined as well. I would much rather have this Persuasion in my DVD collection than the '08 version.
0393324818|5.0|I thought this was going to be a rant about how free agency killed the game of baseball, but it ended up surprising me by pretty much being just the opposite: how free agency has opened the door for innovative leaders who leverage technology and analytics to capitalize on market bias to beat the other teams. It completely changed the way I watch and assess baseball. I only wish there were updates available on what ultimately happened to all the people who played a role in the story. Highly recommended for anyone with an open mind and a love of baseball and/or markets.

I knew that his new CD wouldn't be like his last CD. But wait, maybe he will release another CD in 4 months with more cuts. LOL     This CD reminds me of traveling on the road. It's very laid back. It's a mature side of Usher. I'm still a fan, but this CD was lacking excitement.
055380457X|1.0|The Google Story is not written well at all.  It is a poorly written ad for Google, Standford, and a couple other people.  All you get from the book is that you should do your doctoral studies at Stanford since they are all about capital gain there, and are willing to pay for your patents.<br />The Google guys were not normal in the slightest.  They raised $900,000 from family and friends in a matter of months.  Normal people couldn't get money like that in a lifetime.<br /><br />Persuading the venture capitalists to let them maintain power is rather interesting though.  I will give them an credit for that.<br /><br />The book just has a bunch of random, vague events that anyone could find on Google is they searched.  Wikipedia probably has a better description of Google than David Vise.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this book.  Get online and read about Google if you want to learn more about them.

I applaud him for this one, it was well worth the wait.

My mom used to read this book to me when I was a child and I loved it.  The part that I loved the best was short poem that is repeated.  As a child I even began repeating the poem to my cat, whom I loved deeply.  I was never creeped out by the book, nor did it leave me with any childhood trauma.    When I became a parent I purchased the book for my son.  I am glad to be able to share this book with him as my mother shared it with me.  And now that I am pregnant with my second child I will be purchasing a book for her as well.    I think this book is a lovely story about the love of a mother (and later on father) towards her child.  You must not over-analyze the book or view it from an adult's point of view (honestly, if you analyzed Green Eggs and Ham the same way it would be seen as creepy as well).  If you view this book as it is, a children's book, you will see the love and beauty of it.
B00003CWPL|4.0|This movie is what \\"WTF?\\" was invented for.  When I first saw this film 25 years ago I was at the age and stage of my life in which I was willing to romanticize something just because it was odd.  Someone might take a dump on fine dinnerware and I'd be inclined to consider it \\"edgy\\" or \\"Freudio-sculpturally brilliant.\\"  I don't have that kind of energy any longer and I see the world differently.<br /><br />So it was with interest and forty-eight year old eyes and ears that I sat through my second viewing of Lynch's most famous art film.<br /><br />And I liked it very much.<br /><br />I still don't understand the movie (and I think people work too hard trying to impose meaning upon it), but it kept my interest and I loved Lynch's use of black and white, light, nightmare noises, dialogue. . . everything.  This is the Twilight Zone on 'shrooms, a sort of \\"Lynch's Inferno\\" with an odd protagonist named Henry.  Well, \\"protagonist\\" is too strong a word.  More like a subject-victim moving through the sad experiment of his own existence, an experiment in which no one's in charge and everything is grinding to some sort of unknowable, nothingesqe end.  Mr. X is an oddity; a little spash of congenial personality with his own quirks in an otherwise dark gray world.  \\"The Woman Across The Hall\\" seemed to represent that which might remove us or distract us from our responsibilities/duties/things that bind us (the baby).  Who knows?  Oh, and this film might very well put people off on the whole \\"having kids\\" thing.<br /><br />I may even watch it again sometime, if I live long enough.
B00005JPNZ|2.0|Overall, this movie was a disappointment in the Indiana Jones' saga. The whole alien space ship at the end was hokey. Lucas, yet again, destroys another potentially great movie (see the latest Star Wars movies if you don't know what I'm referring to) with his corny writing. Additionally, the prairie dogs and monkeys also were completely unnecessary. I love the first three, but this will not be a dvd I purchase.
0143038419|5.0|I give it as presents.  Ive highlighted passages.  It is my FAVORITE new book. totally worth the time!
0743496736|5.0|One thing I had no interest in this summer was reading three long books and than having to write 3, 5 page essays.  Fourteen year olds should go out and have fun!  The first book I read was Nineteen Minutes.  I finished the book in two days!  I fell in love with this book, with the title of my favorite.  It made me feel as if no matter what book I read, I would never enjoy it as much.  This book made me feel as if I was in it, as if they were my tears being shed.  I wanted it to go one and I couldn't get through this book fast enough.  The book had a teenage aspect to it as well as an adult one.  It had the parental point of view and the teenage one.  They crossed the lines with sex and I cannot say enough about this book.  It has impacted me for the rest of my life.  Please do not second think this book, read it, enjoy it, and now that I have done that... Live life.  It made it clear how short and precious life is.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Awesome CD.  She is very political but talented musically.  That's what makes the CD so good.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD even though I don't like exercise videos that much. But Jillian's fame preceeds her and I love the Biggest Looser show, so I decided to give it a try. I absolutely love this program. The exercises are difficult at first, but like she says, if we want to exercise for 20 minutes only and get results, we have to work out hard.     My DVD came with a free 30 day trial to her website which has different circuits to choose from. This combined with the exercises from the DVD gave me a plan for an exercise routine and even though my free trial is up, now I know what to do. I have lost weight, I have more endurance (I can do 2 minutes of jumping jacks now!), and have lots more energy.     The only thing I don't like about the DVD is that we can't fastforward to the main menu. Gotta listen to all the previews and other stuff first. I usually start the DVD and go get ready to work out. Also, as someone as mentioned before, some exercises are difficult if you have weak knees so you'll have to modify some of the them, including jumping jacks.    I strongly recommend it :)
B000Y179KO|5.0|This is the best of the Eagles, by far! I saw the video for No More Cloudy Days on AOL and waited an entire year for the CD to come out.  It was worth the wait!  This CD is...is...oh, to find a word that describes it...Eagles, all of the way. Timothy at his best, especially \\"Do Something\\"..wow! This is one of the few CDs that I play over and over again. If you're an Eagles fan, you'll love this one.
0060527986|5.0|Powerful collection of advice and insight that doesn't follow any single line of religious dogma, but instead borrows from all of them to create a universal code of higher wisdom.  This is one of those books (like [[ASIN:0452275644 Napoleon Hill's Positive Action Plan: 365 Meditations For Making Each Day a Success]]) that I will never finish reading -- I'll read it for the rest of my life.
B0014I4KIK|2.0|Duffy's voice is not very well integrated. She has a \\"squeezed\\" timbre on her mid and lower range and her upper tessitura sounds a little unfocused. She has adopted a number of vocal affectations, which I am sure she supposes bestow some sort of historical style on her interpretations.<br /><br />The song arrangements are frequently cluttered and slightly over-wrought - the title track is an example of these things.<br /><br />The songs have been made to sound vaguely like 1960s Brit-Pop/Rock. I wondered why? I guess that the answer is: \\"Why not!?\\". However, after repeated listens to \\"Rockferry\\" - I've been a captive, someone keeps playing it in my workplace - I can only say that Ms Duffy has worn out her welcome with me.<br /><br />I've been told that Duffy is \\"this year's Amy Winehouse\\". Maybe that is so. She has some talent, even though her voice has some problems, and she is far more likely to be alive in five years time than her tacky tattooed terror of a compatriot, who seems to be headed straight for an early demise.
B0018CA996|4.0|They have accomplished there goal of being the same yet different.  It is not a clone of previous works at all, but it is still Portishead in being avant garde electronica.  Before deciding, listen to it at least twice.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Without a doubt, Shelter is one of my favorite gay-themed movies. The director called it the \\"anti-Brokeback\\" and I would have to agree. It's a beautifully written love story that just happens to revolve around two guys, one of whom is on a journey to discover his affectional orientation.    What I loved:      * A new gay image. Both of the main characters, Zach and Shaun, are completely non-stereotypical. They just happen to be gay.      * Happy ending. I'm a sucker for a happy ending and it's good to see that Zach and Shaun live happily ever after. Too many gay movies make it look like gay = drama and heartbreak.      * Sex is kept to a minimum. What little they show is done tastefully. We see nothing below the waist.      * The eye contact they share provides a level of non-sexual intimacy never before seen in a gay movie. These characters are in love. They don't have to say it, because you can see it.      * No fag hag! Zach has an on-and-off girlfriend (Tori) at the beginning of the movie. When she starts to suspect his confusion, she backs off and gives him time to come to terms with himself. She's very much not a gay groupie.    What I disliked:      * Too short. The movie was only 90 minutes, including credits. Some parts felt rushed. Everything was fully fleshed, but I felt it could have gone on another half hour.      * Casting quirks. Tina Holmes' (Jeanne) performance was slightly under-par, compared to everybody else's.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|The first time I put this disc in the player, I was driving home after work (I purchased this album on my lunch break). I had no idea what was in store for me.    The climax of Glosoli brought me to tears.     It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I'd ever heard, and a mix of the intensity of the playing and the brilliance of the arrangement was simply too much for me to handle -- I couldn't help but cry.    It was the first time a song outside of the classical music realm actually made me cry because of the music alone -- certain lyrics have been known to affect me that way emotionally, but not a raw musical performance by a traditional guitar, bass, keys, drums band.     As I continued to listen to the entire disc, I discovered that it was one of the most amazingly performed, musically diverse and well produced albums ever created. And I hold that opinion to this very day.    It's essential.
B000005JA8|5.0|Oh my...what can one say about this one...nothing like had been done before and nothing really since. Brilliant and not for the faint at heart. Like a soundtrack to a surrealistic movie..just pure genius.
B0012E2HRC|5.0|I love this movie so much the chemistry is surprisingly amazing.  This movie was one of my first Meryl Streep movies and after i saw this movie i got hooked.  It shows how excellent both Streep's, and Clint Eastwood's acting are as well as show how amazing Clint Eastwood's directing can be. Set in a town in Iowa where Clint Eastwood's character, Robert Kinkaid meets Francesca(Meryl Streep), on his way to taking pictures of the beautiful bridges for National Geographic magazine.
B0015519VS|3.0|As I listen to the songs on this compact disc, I think to myself the man has grown dramatically over his five year hiatus and the growth shows in a way that it leaves a different feel than what most are use to when they think of Usher.<br /><br />When I first started listening I wanted to solely pay attention to it for the sheer enjoyment but after going, back to listen to it for the second time I found that I enjoyed his Prayer for You (Interlude), Something Special, and Best Thing the most.  Truthfully, it was expected from me for him to put his son on the piece somewhere as well as when you listen to \\"Something Special\\" you could tell he was showing love to his wife, which I thought, was unique.<br /><br />With him teaming up with Jay-Z on \\"Best Thing,\\" I think the beat caught my attention but the song was one of the songs that had a nice musical background to it.  To say that he opened up with his hit \\"Love in This Club\\" I can defiantly say he's back and he's going to give his fan what he always gives them a show to remember.<br /><br />As a fan of Usher's this is not my favorite compilation but it is an appreciated piece and I definitely look forward to the next complication and as always Mr. Raymond will always have my support.
0446530573|3.0|The product was stated as to be in almost perfect condition but when we received it, it really was not. There was writing on the inside of the cover, scratches, and i actually had to wipe it off because of something sticky on it. Not very impressed.
B0015519VS|3.0|This cd is for sure different but i embrace that. Cant be talking about little kid stuff forever. His voice is flawless on this cd. I like it. Few songs i don't care for but all and all. It will be in my cd case. I think Love in a club was a for sure mistake. But i can just skip over that song every time. Real fans will buy it.
0894803123|5.0|I bought this book with my Cuisinart 1 1/2-qt ice cream maker. I highly suggest doing this as well. All the full recipes fit perfectly and they can easily be halved to make just a small amount of ice cream. The only drawback for me is that they don't have frozen yogurt recipes in this book so I'll have to figure it out some other way. However, the ice cream is amazing, just like from the store, and the sorbets are good, too.
0446402389|4.0|I enjoyed the book. Part thriller, part history on Russia and the 50s. I will try his next effort to see how he progresses.
B000HEYVD6|3.0|This is my first Baldacci read, and Camel Club was enjoyable enough to pick up more of his books. One of my favorite genres is the political/espionage/thriller, and this has a good balance of technical info, action, and character development. You do engage with the characters and that allows you to get past some of the wordy or improbable parts.     Unfortunately this book suffers from a common fault of many writers in that Baldacci rolls out a lot of the worn out political talking points for texture rather than actually creating real back story. One character is angry because his army unit was decimated by Agent Orange; another character loved \\"Ronnie\\" Reagan but thought Jimmy Carter was the best president ever; the American invasion of Iraq turned Baghdad into a \\"constant fireball,\\" etc.     Just skip over the political commercials and you will enjoy this book. It's a great beach read.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|An easy version of the movie well worth watching. This version cuts the gore that is really meaningless. The directors cut is the one to get and enjoy. The music is wonderful as well. Stays with you. Movie insights to read the book. Well acted by all. A look at life from a tender aspect, this topsy turvy movie is reality meeting reality head on. Jake Gyllenhaal's dark personality shows through again.
0061245097|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. I loved this series and I can't wait for the next book. If you like Patricia Briggs's Blood Bound you will like these books....
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I was so impressed with this movie!  I am a huge Beatles fan, have been forever and this movie really delivers.  It has a great way of using the great Beatles songs we know and love and putting them in the movie in a different way that still allows us to remember the original, but not feel cheated that it wasn't exactly how we first heard them.  The characters names are great to remember the songs and so are some references.  It is placed in the sixties and doesn't seem to really preach or take sides, but show what was going on at the time.  I totally and highly recommend this movie!!!!
B0014I4KIK|4.0|I also heard Duffy on the radio and immediately loved Mercy.  I pre-ordered it from Amazon and couldn't wait to receive it.  I love her voice and I must say as much of a fan I am/was of Amy Winehouse...I Duffy just has a better sound for me.  I pray she does not go down the same path as poor Amy.  Or as I said to my husband the other day when I couldn't remember Amy's name...that drug addict singer.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Great film, tasteful, classic.  No cheezy acting or story lines.  Great story prob mainly because it's some what based on author's own exp.  Great actors/actress, great camera works, music and locations.  Very heart moving and true to self type of film. Must see, and I certainly going to buy one now that I've rented it.
B000ZBPQEO|5.0|The complete set also included Karajan rehearsal extracts for  Bartók Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta (CD24 mono)  Mozart Symphony No.39      (CD63 stereo)  Mozart Symphony No.40, 41   (CD64 stereo)  The last two have been released before.
B000ELJBAA|3.0|David Gilmour's second solo effort, About Face, leaves something to be desired. It's nowhere as interesting as his first release. About Face peaked at #32 on the charts. There weren't any singles from the album that cracked Billboard's Top 200.     The album opens with \\"Until We Sleep\\", easily the best song on the album. It's really the only song that rises above the average. There's a kind of urgency within the song that makes it a dynamic effort.\\"Murder\\", among almost every song here with the exception of \\"Cruise\\", is an average effort; Gilmour does present us with a decent lead. It's the tempo change in the last third of this song that saves it. \\"Love on the Air\\" is co-written with Pete Townshend (The Who) that's a mellow song. It sounds like it could have been an outtake from The Wall. \\"Blue Light\\" could be the next best song. It has horns in it which gives it a sort of feel of being mainstream or R & B. A very unusual effort by him. \\"Out of the Blue\\" is a slow song that has some good lyrics. \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\" is also co-written with Pete Townshend. It's got some decent lead passages but not what we normally expect from him. \\"You Know I'm Right\\" has some lyrics that will make you stop & think a little bit. This song is probably among the three best on the album. It sounds a little more like what we've come to expect from him. It has some horn sections in it that eventually gives it a little bit of a jazz tone. \\"Cruise\\" is easily the weakest song of the album. It's the closest thing to pop on the album; the last fourth of it turns to reggae. This just doesn't fit very well into the Gilmour song catalog. \\"Let's Get Metaphysical\\" is an instrumental. Is it a statement from Gilmour toward Olivia Newton-John who had a hit two years previously titled \\"Physical\\"? I don't know, there's nothing similar about them, my guess would be that Gilmour is telling us that there's a higher plane that we can reach. The album closes with \\"Near the End\\" . Gilmour treats us toa very good acoustical lead in the final section of the song, he then switches to an electric lead that's very subtle production switch.     The remastering is excellent, a vast improvement from the original. The booklet doesn't have any liner notes but lyrics to the songs are included. The band he uses is completely different from his first solo project. Jeff Porcaro (drums) was a highly respected drummer & was in Toto. Pino Palladino (bass) played with many artists. Ian Kewley (keyboards) performed with Samson. Guest artists abound & include Steve Winwood (piano & organ), Anne Dudley (synthesizer)(Art of Noise), Bob Ezrin (keyboards co-producer), Louis Jardine (percussion), Ray Cooper (percussion) & Jon Lord (synthesizer) (Deep Purple).
B000GIWS7E|5.0|This has to be the best musical performance by a rock band ever.  After you watch it about 20 times and become familiar with it you will be stunned at how talented these guys are.  The sound and video are top notch. Each member is incredible.  Raise the Knife is so good.
B0016B6ZKG|2.0|This CD is nothing like the albums that Donna Summer made at the peak of her career. Now, the singing is flat, uninspiring. She often takes the background, behind hip-hop/rap vocalists. Not one track on this CD holds any drama. Compare these tracks to, say, \\"Dim All The Lights,\\" or \\"Macarthur Park.\\"
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just finished my third work out on this DVD and I can ALREADY feel a difference.  As someone who has taken an extended break from working out and exercising, I needed something that would motivate me to keep going after one week.  Jillian keeps you motivated with no-nonsense commentary, and a fast paced work out with no breaks.  If you are looking for a way to jump back into working out after taking a break this is the perfect DVD for you.
0440237688|4.0|This book is, at least in part, a cautionary tale, in the tradition of Brave New World and 1984, about the danger of allowing ourselves and our government to continue slouching toward paternalistic statism.  The difference between it and those older and better known stories of dystopic societies is that this one is written for kids.      I found the book to be well written, well paced, and of a length that won't scare off tweens and teens.  The development of Jonah was quite well done within the constraints of such a short book (171 pages in  the paperback edition I read); he was likable and sufficiently flawed so as to be believable.  As for the other characters (excepting The Giver), their lack of development is one of the points.      The Giver does a fine job of giving the reader food for thought and discussion about the inverse relationship between individual liberty and the imposition of outcomes by governments and communities.  It's not a one-sided account on that score, however.  I often found myself being seduced by the security, safety, and civility that accompanied the depicted totalitarian society.  As is typical of good fiction that tells some significant truth, that balance allows the reader to come to a conclusion through seeking and thinking as opposed to having it thrust down his throat; that makes the The Giver's case against soft fascism a strong one.    I do find it a delicious irony that the education establishment, a great friend to the statist movement, has embraced this book.      Some have complained that the book contains some logical inconsistencies.  I thought those were minor and they didn't significantly detract from my enjoyment of the book.    There are some mature themes that some parents won't be comfortable with their kids reading about.  These include infanticide and senicide, capital punishment for crimes far short of murder and rape, and some fairly oblique sexual themes.
0143038419|5.0|I can't say enough great things about this book.  I am recently divorced and could completely relate to her situation, her fears, her journey overall.  Not only that, I think Gilbert is an amazing writer!  She's not afraid to just put it out there and she's hysterical while doing it!      I had a hard time beleiving that people actually did not like this book, but maybe you need to have a certain sense of humor and sarcasm to full enjoy it.      I recommend it to everyone I know...haven't had anyone come back dissapointed...yet!
B00169XU8I|5.0|Pure pop fun...contemporary without losing her identity on this recording. Another must have for Madonna fans. Best songs are Give It 2 Me and Miles Away....
B0000062FL|5.0|Santana-Abraxas ****1/2<br /><br />When some people think of the Gibson SG guitar they think of Angus Young of AC/DC or Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath or sometimes even Pete Townsend of The Who, and while all of those are great guitarists, None of them was able to make that baby cry like Carlos Santana was on the groups first two albums. Weaving his guitar lines through hit singles like their reading of the (original) Fleetwood Macs 'Black Magic Women' and 'Oye Como Va' for the mainstream to hear that the guitar could be played more than just one way....with passion.<br /><br />Passion is what fueled Abraxas, the passion to make a better album than their first. This certainly did become a bigger album, and even to this day is the bands signature release, and while I myself am partial to the debut, I must give this the recognition it deserves.<br /><br />Songs like the Aretha Franklin meets Miles Davis 'Incident At Nesbar' and the rocking 'Hope Your Feeling Better' are straight up rockers. The former contains a fantastic organ solo from Rolie, and the latter has amazing production and a catchy chorus, not to mention some amazing wha-wha pedal work from Carlos. The Carlos original 'Samba Pa Ti' transcends beauty with power to create one of the most sublime recordings in all of rock, rivaled only by his own 'Europa' which would come a few albums later. 'Se A Cabo' 'Mothers Daughter' and 'El Nicoya' show the percussion of the band as heard on the debut, and that is my only complaint with Abraxas is that the Latin and African rhythm has almost all but disappeared.<br /><br />Santana set out to make a great rock n' roll record with Abraxas and ultimately that is what they did. I loved the debut because of it's variety and instrumental prowess into multiple genres and worldly music, some of that was lost here, but this still remains a great rock album, and one of the all time best in fact.<br /><br />Now some releases of Abraxas come with three bonus tracks. 'Se A Cabo' and 'Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen' are both here live recorded at The Royal Albert Hall in 1970, but 'Toussaint L'Overture' is also included live from that same show, and it is one hell of a performance. So if you have the choice of either the original version or with the bonus tracks go for the extra as it costs the same and is way worth it.here live recorded at The Royal Albert Hall in 1970, but 'Toussaint L'Overture' is also included live from that same show, and it is one hell of a performance.

B00005JPNZ|2.0|Indiana Jones is back and those who love [[ASIN:B00003CXC5 the original films]], especially [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Raiders of the Lost Ark]], will be placed under the spell of nostalgic bliss until you realize the following:  That Harrison Ford is just a cranky old man punching-in for one last paycheck; John Hurt is Raspberry Award destined every single time without proper directorial guidance; Ray Winstone's character was seemingly forced into the screenplay, no one cares who he is or why he is there; the hype about how Shia LaBeouf is entirely undeserving of any and all kinds of hype is spot on; George Lucas is fat-headed and out of touch with what made the original films great, and really, after Jar-Jar how are we surprised?; and Karen Allen smiles in every scene as if she can't believe for one second that she is in a  $185 million dollar movie, and neither could I.  I will say in all fairness that Cate Blanchett is as professional as to be expected.  There are scenes in this film that capture the excitement and unlikely humorous action of the original three, but where [[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 Temple of Doom]] and [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 Last Crusade]] at times teetered on pushing the degree to which I will suspend disbelief in exchange for a laugh, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls doesn't assume I want to believe any of its shenanigans.  I don't want to be critical of the fundamental science fiction/historical fiction story, because it could've worked in the right hands and with actors and filmmakers who knew the magic they had with the original films.  Surprise! They're cashing in this time around kids, so don't be fooled.<br /><br />Harrison Ford has bits of that same presence but his effort is clearly lacking.  He plays Dr. Jones as if he just doesn't seem impressed with discovering these artifacts anymore.  His performances in the earlier films expressed that of a passionate archeologist, someone who cares tremendously about the artifact he must recover and preserve.  He wanted to stop the Nazis from getting the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail because they were arrogant enough to think they were actually worthy of such power.  They were plunderers. There was a lesson in there and even though it was just an action film, the message was a little more than just \\"Nazis, I hate these guys\\".  None of that exists here in the fourth installment.  The passion behind discovering history's most provoking questions seems to have been lost and that is after all why Indy would do absolutely anything, including jump from a horse into a moving jeep with eight armed men, to recover an item and ensure that it is kept from those who would abuse its power.  Besides, Han Solo and Indy are two great heroes but with all due respect, in interviews Harrison Ford gives me the creeps.  He has that creepy earring and that subtle and cold arrogance.  I hate criticizing celebrities but he just doesn't come off as a likeable guy and there are times during this film that he isn't really acting at all, so it is kind of relevant to mention.<br /><br />I want to explain what completely ruined this film for me.  I was actually prepared to give this three or four stars and a slight recommendation until the film started to climax and the unbelievable happened.  Even among scenes of CGI dancing, landing on rocks as if they were pillows, cheesy and rushed written dialogue etc., I could not believe it when one character was knocked from a cavalry of moving vehicles in the jungle and into some vines above.  Somehow this character miraculously obtained the ability to telepathically communicate to the monkeys in the same way that Aquaman communicates with fish, and so they followed as he made his through the jungle via vine-swinging like Tarzan.  Perhaps this was because the scorpion that bit him earlier was radioactive?  It is the kind of scene the skews everything for me.  I began to realize I was watching a bad movie and I grew quite sad.<br /><br />I would listen to anyone who says that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the greatest adventure film ever made, so my realization halfway through Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls was profoundly disheartening.  I loved these movies but as with any sequel, there are too many powers banking on the idea that the success of the original can be equaled.  Unfortunately for us, $311 million dollars later and they are still right.Raiders of the Lost Ark is the greatest adventure film ever made, so my realization halfway through Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls was profoundly disheartening.

B00013UTUM|4.0|The \\"Hullabaloo Soundtrack\\" is a mixed bag. Aside \\"[[ASIN:B0001LJC2K Absolution]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B000FVQYYK Black Holes and Revelations]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000AMPZF8 Origin of Symmetry]],\\" the studio Hullabaloo disc offers little comparison. This disc is what it is . . . a collection of leftovers that weren't good enough to be released on a regular LP. I suppose that we should be grateful that the material has been released since there are some highlights. The instrumentals stand out as both compelling and especially unusual in the Muse pantheon. If you're a Muse fanatic like me, you'll find these tunes interesting, but the material will never resonate like the songs on their more contemporary releases. The selling point for \\"Hullabaloo Soundtrack\\" is the live disc. It's a great snap shot at what can now be regarded as an earlier time period for Muse. The recording and performance quality is fantastic. I'd describe it as having a harder edge than other Muse shows that I've experienced. 'Citizen Erased' and 'Space Dementia' are highlights. While interesting, the show falls short of [[ASIN:B000XTLUW0 Haarp]], the ultimate live Muse release. While the first CD is only for the faithful, the second disc can be appreciated by the casual listener with an interest in the band's live show. After acquiring all of the band's 'A' list albums, \\"Hullabaloo Soundtrack\\" will nicely fill out any Muse collection.
0143112724|1.0|I could've done without the illustrations in this edition of the Elements of Style. Also, they've put the page numbers on the inside margins of the pages. So if you look up a reference in the index, you then have to open the book wide to find the page number, which should be placed on the outer margin where it's easy to spot as you flip through.<br /><br />All I wanted was the Elements of Style, which is a great book. I'll buy the normal edition. This one is irritating.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|This dvd box set was more than I ever dreamed it could be. It has each of the four films in both the theatrical release and the Directors cut, eight full films in all. In addition there is a disc of background info for each of the four, and a final disc that relates to the entire Alien Quadrilogy. I found it difficult maneuver through menu on the special effects disc's, as apparently the Alien orginazational philosophy was byond me.    If you are an Alien Fan this is a MUST HAVE set.    I am giving my four VHS versions of the Alien series to my Son. I loved them, but they can't hold a candle to this set.

B0018RBN8C|3.0|I had a hard time paying attention to this album.  'Mercy' and 'Distant Dreamer' were the only songs I was able to listen to in their entirety and not skip to the next song halfway through.  It's the type of music you'll hear playing in the background at a coffee shop.  Easy on the ears but not enough to catch your attention and distract ya from whatever else you may be doing.  'Mercy' is the only tune that'll make you notice that the album is still even playing. She's got a great voice, just needs more work.  All in all I guess not too bad for a debut album, but nothing great either.  I would prefer to hear more tunes from her along the lines as 'Mercy'.  IMO
B000P12LWY|4.0|\\"The Tudors\\" is a highly entertaining, decadent, sumptuous, R-rated soap opera. As you can tell right from the sudsy opening credits, this is not a \\"period piece\\" like you would see on the BBC or in a Merchant & Ivory film. Despite its setting in 16th century England, it really has more in common with other modern cable dramas. It uses the setting of the Court of Henry VIII as a way to explore the relationships between politics, religion, sex, power and overindulgence.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Henry VIII as an unapologetic alpha male who truly seems to feel that the world around him is obliged to indulge his every whim and desire. Excessive, melodramatic, impulsive and passionate, the smartest and most cunning people around him use flattery and subtle manipulation in order to follow through with their own agendas. Some of the characters who inhabit the first season include his best friend Charles, who uses his position to live like a promiscuous rock star, Cardinal Wolsey, who runs Henry's political affairs while positioning himself to be Pope, Ann Boleyn, who seduces Henry as a calculated move to gain power and position for her family, and Henry's wife Queen Katherine, who, although dignified and virtuous, will not gotten out of the way easily.<br /><br />I've never studied the actual history of Henry VIII, so I really can't speak to the historical accuracy of the show. I can say that the show seems to be speaking as much about modern politics through its storylines as the issues of the day. The show is at its best when the characters have to face the consequences for their opportunistic, self-indulgent behavior, and at it's work when, like so many other cable dramas, it feels the need for excessive use of simulated, soft-core porn style sex scenes.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|Within the first 5 seconds of the first song on the first listen - I was hooked - Didn't matter what was to come - I KNEW I'd love it.  I've always admired Mike Oldfield's works.  Sometimes they are great and sometimes they are outstanding.  This falls in the later.  Absolutely an exceptional piece of music.  You cannot possibly go wrong with this one.
B0000A118M|5.0|I have the deluxe edition that includes the Antibes performance of A Love Supreme as well as that \\"lost\\" recording with Archie Shepp and Art Davis.  I don't think this additional material is all that necessary unless you are  a student of this man's music.<br /><br />The actual release \\"A Love Supreme\\" is a recording that belongs in every serious music collection.  This is wonderful, inspired music.  It is the pinnacle of Coltrane's career, no question.  Everything about Trane's music changed from this point forward.  A Love Supreme is a summation of all his previous work and an introduction to the music to come.  It is probably the most sincere, heartfelt work ever release by a \\"jazz\\" musician, perhaps any musician.<br /><br />There are two recordings in post-bop jazz that transcend everything else.  1. Kind of Blue<br />2. A Love Supreme<br /><br />If you are a musician, the Lewis Porter biography is an essential companion to A Love Supreme.  It contains detailed analysis of Trane's approach to improvisation on this masterwork.<br /><br />One amazing fact about this release is that it was put together with very little rehearsal and preparation. The music was not fully written out for that matter.  Given this information, it's amazing how PERFECT this recording and the performances of all of the musicians, both collectively and individually really is.<br /><br />In summary, A Love Supreme is one of America's finest contributions to world culture and a high point in the creative spirit of humanity.  What more can be said?

B0015519VS|4.0|After taking two spins through this cd I am hooked.  Usher has been away growing up for the past few years and it is quite evident in his music.  For those that are into the music that is hot right now...ie R Kelly's single about braiding hair...or all the Crank dat songs...you probably won't be impressed with this cd.  However, for those true music fans that are TIRED of all the so called music that is out now, this is worth adding to your collection.      Usher made sure to include enough of the old ingredients that have made him successful in the past which is seen on \\"Love in this Club\\".  But true music fans will surely appreicate his maturity on cuts like \\"Before I Met You\\" and \\"Appetite\\" where Usher is crooning about changing his creeping ways and being a man.  \\"Moving Mountains\\" and \\"Love You Gently\\" showcase his vocal abilities.      People do not sleep on this one.  It is not a club burner like Confessions was...but it is a great cd in its own rights.

1596061308|5.0|I kept hearing about this book...  sometimes people are right when they recommend something.  I don't know why it took me so long to get around to this, but whenever it happens, it's a very good thing!<br /><br />Sometime in the future, earth is much like it was but is really a distant back-water as all the action is happening in space.  There, the Colonial Defense Forces are fighting battles to secure mankind's foothold amongst the stars.  They control all access to space-travel and the only way off-planet is to volunteer in the CDF at the age of 65 and join the forces at 75.  No one knows what happens after that--no CDF members have ever returned.  John Perry's wife has died 8 years previously and he's ready to go.  Like others, Perry and his fellow group of recruites are curious about what may be ahead.  They expect to somehow be rejuvenated.  Earth-side tech has only extended life minimally--to around 100 years--so old age still looms as much as ever.<br /><br />What actually happens to these volunteers who give up everything when they leave Earth is an incredible tale.  It's a sort of rites of passage for the elderly as we follow Perry and the new friends he makes through their voyage off-world and into testing and the \\"physical improvement regimen\\" and training/boot-camp and into battle and beyond.  It's life-affirming that it is never too late to teach old dogs new tricks (well, most of the time, anyway), and that these people look forward to the future and wish to serve.  Soldiering on endless battlefields is not so life-affirming, but perhaps it's necessary?  At least they hope so, although at times it all seems senseless.  There are so many cool notes hit in this book while the action and adventure never ends.  Perry is a special sort of everyman, easy to relate to and yet has that bit of good sense and intelligence and quick-thinking that enables him to excel in this strange new world.<br /><br />It's an engrossing journey from small-town America to the aliens and technology of the stars.  How will humanity fare, with changes and enhancements and seemingly endless warfare on a galactic scale?  Watching this all through the eyes of John Perry, one is caught up easily and so willingly.  The characters are well-drawn and sympathetic, the plot gripping and filled with mind-boggling concepts and military action.  It's a novel very worthy of the praise it has been receiving.of the stars.  How will humanity fare, with changes and enhancements and seemingly endless warfare on a galactic scale?

B0016A2FFG|5.0|Al Green has definitely been on a row in recent years, returning to his soulful roots.  I CAN'T STOP was widely anticipated by Green fans who were happy just to hear Al Green return to his R&B roots after a long stint singing merely gospel music. I CAN'T STOP wasn't a complete triumph, but it was good starting place.  What might've been even more surprising was the fact that after 2003's Grammy-nominated I CAN'T STOP, Rev. Green went on to release 2005's EVERYTHING'S OK, again reunited with producer Willie Mitchell.  While EVERYTHING'S OK felt a bit more authentic than I CAN'T STOP, hardcore Green fans couldn't help but feel that Green needed something more to make an authentic return to soul.  While the contemporary R&B stylings by such modern producers as Bryan-Michael Cox or even the old school songwriting by Tank or Shaffer \\"Ne-Yo\\" Smith would've corrupted Green's authenticity, it was certainly agreed that Green should try something new to give him back his seamless southern-soul sound.  That person turned out to surprisingly be Ahmir \\"?uestlove\\" Thompson from the Roots.<br /><br />?uestlove could've styled Green in Roots laden production with samples and ultimately perplexing production work, but rather than be self-indulgent, ?uestlove produces perhaps the best soul album of the decade, and certainly Green's best album of his trio of modern albums. LAY IT DOWN is perfect in nearly every way.  Not only is Green top-notch, so is the production, as well as collaborators Anthony Hamilton, Corinne Bailey Rae, and John Legend.  And don't think that the \\"sound\\" of classic Al Green albums are replaced - they aren't.  ?uestlove merely updates Green and still utilizes the live settings that made him so popular on tracks such as \\"Love and Happiness\\" or the ubiquitous \\"Let's Stay Together\\".<br /><br />I won't bore you praising every track, as every track here is nearly 100%, honestly, But I'll leave you with a top five, something I usually don't do.<br /><br />1. Lay It Down (feat. Anthony Hamilton)<br />2. Take Your Time (feat. Corinne Bailey Rae)<br />3. Just Me<br />4. Too Much<br />5. You Got That Luv I Need (feat. Anthony Hamilton)<br /><br />4 ½ stars Al.amilton)  2. Take Your Time (feat. Corinne Bailey Rae)  3. Just Me   4. Too Much  5. You Got That Luv I Need (feat. Anthony Hamilton)    4 ½ stars Al.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This album literally made me go WHOA. David Lee Roth proves why he's an entertainer. Michael Anthony proves why he's a great background vocalist, and bassist. Everyone on this record proves who they really are. Feel your love tonight really stands out to me out of all of them. Your question, why so? Because, when I play it in the car, the party emotions kick it. Dave sings it in that great way. Great album folks.
B0015519VS|4.0|Any fan of Usher's who had bought CONFESSIONS surely didn't expect Usher to release an album that sounded like CONFESSIONS.  After a four-year hiatus between CONFESSIONS and 2008's HERE I STAND, a lot has changed in R&B/Hip-Hop. The \\"sound\\" of an R&B album has definitely changed since Usher's ubiquitous \\"Yeah\\" boomed from the speakers of every club and high-school dance. Producer/Songwriter The-Dream has invented the \\"new\\" sound of R&B while hip-hop producers the likes of Danja and will.i.am have replaced the \\"southern-tastic\\" productions of Lil' Jon, whom helmed \\"Yeah\\".  With that said, HERE I STAND isn't as good as CONFESSIONS, but that is to be expected.  Who can top an album that sold ten million copies in the U.S.? Aside from that though, HERE I STAND is a good, solid album.  It updates the sounds of 2004's CONFESSIONS, even if you feel some of Usher's \\"playboy\\" appeal has been replaced with a more manly, \\"matured\\" Usher.  Where his voice is concerned, he's even better here than CONFESSIONS, which definitely shows he has taken care of his distinctive tenor vocals and his definitive falsetto.<br /><br />The album opens with one of the year's better Intros, in which anyone can instantly see that Usher's vocals are still at the top.  \\"Love In This Club\\" is one of his few concessions to his clubby past, synonymous with 2004's \\"Yeah\\", only more refined.  Polow Da Don's production is searing and excited with a killer beat, and cold-hard synths. Jeezy's verse even shows growth on his part as a rapper (well at least he isn't rapping about cocaine...) Again, \\"Love In This Club\\" was destined to give Usher another #1.  \\"This Ain't Sex\\" is reminiscent of the production work on Mary J. Blige's \\"Just Fine\\" or the more obscure \\"Til The Morning\\" from her GROWING PAINS album.  It took a bit for this one to grow on me, like it did Blige's \\"Just Fine\\", but now it is one of my favorites. The sound is reminiscent of 1980s/early 90's R&B, which may be why there's a vintage aspect to this track.  Sure, it isn't \\"Caught Up\\", but it is fresh and a different, more \\"grown\\" sound for Usher, without isolating those girls who love him (even if he's married and a daddy).<br /><br />For those fearing Usher had swore off of his sexual persona, the kinky \\"Trading Places\\" could've been well at home on any R. Kelly album.  It is both odd, yet somehow endearing to the listener. Here, Usher boast about being \\"on the bottom\\" (if you know what I mean) hence \\"trading places\\". Better though may be the big ballad of HERE I STAND, the brilliant \\"Moving Mountains\\", in which Usher has never sounded better.  It's not \\"Burn\\" per say, but it is certainly top notch in my opinion.  Will.i.am lends a hand on \\"What's Your Name\\" which is solid by all means, if a bit underwhelming compared to the first portion of the album.  \\"Prayer for You (Interlude)\\", Usher sings to his newborn son, Usher Raymond V, in perhaps one of his most sincere, heartfelt performances.  Just as genuine is Usher's soulful turn on \\"Something Special\\" in which Raymond rocks out to a soulful guitar and a spare drum groove.<br /><br />\\"Love You Gently\\" returns Usher back to 2008 with it's \\"icy\\" drum programming and bright sounding synths.  This is another personal favorite of mine, though it does seem like it takes this track a while to warm up. \\"Best Thing\\" featuring Jay-Z is good, if average, while \\"Before I Met You\\" features production work by master producer Bryan Michael Cox.  It is solid if a bit lengthy, an issue with HERE I STAND in general. \\"His Mistakes\\" truly shows Usher's maturity as a man and artist, backed by great production work from Stargate and the taut lyrics of none other than Shaffer \\"Ne-Yo\\" Smith (Also to be noted is that Usher co-writes all the tracks on HERE I STAND). \\"Appetite\\" is hip, and a nice departure from such adult R&B oriented numbers like \\"His Mistakes\\" or \\"Something Special\\".<br /><br />\\"What's A Man To Do\\" also proves to be solid, though i personally enjoyed \\"His Mistakes\\", the other Stargate helmed production, the best.  \\"Lifetime\\" is an exceptional track, while \\"Love In This Club, Part II\\" doesn't trump \\"Love In this Club\\", even with vocoder savvy Lil' Wayne or coy Beyonce adding there great talents.  \\"Here I Stand\\" itself is a nice closure, though there is a hidden track within the 9:30 duration, which I'll let all you savvy buyers evaluate for yourself.<br /><br />Overall, HERE I STAND is a solid, modern R&B album. It could never eclipse CONFESSIONS, but it is consistent for the most part.  The biggest detraction is there is too much material to absorb and some of the songs are too long.  There is no outright miss here in the least, which is phenomenal for an album this \\"bloated\\" with material. 4 stars in my eyes. I highly recommend this one for all R&B enthusiasts and Usher fans.ed production, the best.  \\"Lifetime\\" is an exceptional track, while \\"Love In This Club, Part II\\" doesn't trump \\"Love In this Club\\", even with vocoder savvy Lil' Wayne or coy Beyonce adding there great talents.  \\"Here I Stand\\" itself is a nice closure, though there is a hidden track within the 9:30 duration, which I'll let all you savvy buyers evaluate for yourself.

B0001611DI|5.0|There's something about \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" that makes it so captivating. Sure, there are plenty of great zombie movies out there, but this classic is one not to be missed. In case you're unfamiliar with it, it's kind of like a non-sequential continuation of \\"Night of the Living Dead\\". Set in Philadelphia, this tells of four SWAT-team members that hide out in a mall from the living dead, while taking advantage of the mall and getting kicks outta it, too.  That alone should let you know that this movie is awesome. Imagine what it would be like to shoot down the flesh-eating undead in a massive mall! This movie has everything from the zombie horror of blood-splattering and flesh-eating to thrilling action to slapstick comedy. The movie goes from scary to funny to sociopolitical all in its two-hour run.  \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is, in case I didn't state it enough, an extraordinary movie. What other zombie flick offers shooting zombies down in an open field at the break of dawn, a blue-skinned Hare Krsna zombie and makeup artist legend Tom Savini in a leather-clad biker gang riding their motorcycles in the dead of night?  Yep, this movie goes from the slaying of the undead to genuinely ironically funny moments, such as slapping a whipped cream pie in a zombie's face, or the scene where two of the guys take the money from a register and smile for the security camera (that one's a good laugh!).  And just to prove that this zombie movie doesn't disappoint, there's plenty of the red stuff getting splattered from zombies and victims alike, alongside their consumption of flesh! And yeah, I'm sure you're aware of the social commentaries on the buyer's consumption at the mall. George A. Romero's good at the double-entendres in the plot like that, he's quite an intelligent film-maker.  \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is definitely a special movie, and isn't necessarily one of those movies that you'd pop in every week or so. It's an experiece, and a stunning one at that, both visually and at timesintellectually. So kudos to Mr. Romero, who knew what he was doing and never sold out, you made a great movie! All fans of zombie films MUST watch this classic! You won't be disappointed! Thanks for the time, and peace.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This is the culmination of a wonderful seven year history.  Gilmore Girls is not \\"just\\" a TV show.  It is phenomenon with a cult following.  The people who made this show great will continue to be missed.    Now that my gushing is over lets get down to business.  Season seven had some interesting moments and for most fans it is not a favorite season due to certain story lines.  Keep in mind that the writers of this season had to play out what was left in their laps by Amy.  I do believe the final episode was worth the entire thing, and it ended as it began which is classic.      The DVD set itself was great and for those who, like myself, need captions will be happy to see they are back, but the DVD's are still in the overlapping case which can be a nuisance to get into.  The extras include things like a day in the life of Keiko Agena or Kirk's tour which does have a small disappointer after Kirk mentioning going to the Dragonfly repeatedly later on in the tour we never get there.  However it is a small annoyance, and I highly recommend getting the DVD's.  No I did not get into detail regarding the season because do not want to ruin it for anyone.
0316067601|5.0|This is a real life thriller, a page turning action story.  Because it promises so much gut wrenching, life endangering drama later on, it can be easy to get bored by the earlier chapters where the author takes you through the ropes, training to be a Navy Seal.  But if one is patient, all of that makes the characters come to life later and makes the losses more poingant and meaningful.  If you want to cut right to the action, go to page 211 and it is non stop from there to the last page.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|3.1 out of 5 stars?????? Have the trolls taken over??? Oh I get it, A bunch of people are resorting to their \\"OMG TEH CAMERA IZ TEH SHAXZERZ IT MAYKEZ ME DIZZY!!!!!!!11!\\" bullcrap. Well guess what? NOBODY CARES.<br /><br />This film was meant to be shaky. You think you can run down a street and hold a camera straight??? If so, you're an idiot. I saw this on opening day and I'll never forget how much tension was going through me. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.<br /><br />The story is: A group of people are throwing a goodbye party for their friend going away to Japan. On the night of the party, a monster attacks and terrorizes the city, and 5 people must fight to stay alive. The movie was taken from the point of Hud and the video camera, and this film is done in the very interesting style of filming an account of the attack.<br /><br />This movie was amazing. Fantastic acting, straight and to-the-point action, wastes no time on character development, and has one of the most chilling apocalyptic endings since The Birds. The ending is rather left open, and that's a good thing, because I'd rather that type of ending than an ending where the monster dies and people celebrate like nothing ever happened.<br /><br />Another thing I like was how there were NO cliches- there is no scene where the scientist steps into the frame and delivers a boring, 5 minute Shakespearian monologue about the origin of the Monster. You don't know where the monster came from... and that's a good thing.<br /><br />So overall, in the time of cliche'd and stupid movies like Sex And The City, Shutter, Meet The Spartans, and 27 Dresses, we get a very tight and fast paced film that is very No-BS, has your heart racing, your adrenaline pumping, and your blood rushing. Overall, a very profound movie. And please kick yourself in the nuts if you didn't see this in the theater. I saw it in the theater on opening day and loved it. I own it on DVD. That very day I saw it, I was on the edge of my seat and felt like I was on a nonstop rollercoaster.top rollercoaster.

0671027344|5.0|As THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER begins it appears to be yet another in the long line of coming of age stories.  The story is told from the perspective of an adolescent who is a bit of an outcast and has suffered a trauma.  The story is even told through a series of letters very much in the style of Anne Frank's diary.  After the first few pages though it becomes apparent that there is something more going on here.  The hero, Charlie, was just beginning his first year in high school as the novel opens.  A few months earlier a friend had committed suicide which had shocked and depressed Charlie to the point his parents sent him to therapy.      Gradually as the school year progresses Charlie begins to carve out a space for himself.  He even begins to find acceptence with a new group of friends and experience the usual teenage traumas, the experimentation with drugs and alcohol and sex but it also becomes increasingly apparent that something more is going on with Charlie.  Charlie seems to take things much harder than everyone else, whether it is the recent death of his friend or the long ago one of his beloved aunt he continues to grieve long after others have recovered.  He passes through life more as an observer than a participant, much as if he really doesn't understand the rules.  Eventually the reasons for his odd behavior are explained in a twist that will probably take the reader by surprise.    The reading level of this book is about 5th or 6th grade but the subject matter is too mature for anyone much younger than 13 or 14.  Like the best examples of 'coming of age' books, CATCHER IN THE RYE, THE OUTSIDERS, HUCKLEBERRY FINN etc. THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER will appeal even to those who have long since left adolescence behind.  It is a book that should be read, then shared with others and discussed at length.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I feel in love with Sky Blue Sky one song at a time. Over the past year each song has been a favorite at least for a few days. I love this band. The US may never have produced the \\"great American novel\\" but we have several \\"great American song writers\\". Count Jeff Tweedy among them.    Down with the talkers!!
B000FVRACK|5.0|There's not much to add to what others have said about this DVD -- it's superb.
B000OT6V00|4.0|While not one of my favorite movies I do like the movie and story line (although the whole good guy against an occult infatuated nazi bad guy is quite re-used in hollywood) and find it fun to watch from time to time therefore a good addition to the blu collection.  I had the DVD and have to say the transfer to Blu is SOOO much sharper and crisper then the DVD.<br /><br />Quick reply to the donk who claimed blu-ray wouldn't be around much longer... (Blue ray to bad, Updated, December 26, 2007 By  Robert J. Talbot) I saw a Betamax player on Craigslist that you might be interested in...

B0018QCXGY|3.0|Well I will start off that the movie is fairly decent story wise but really dissappointed me with the hand held camera perspective.  I know blair witch was an initial success due to some really smart marketing (which by the way seemed to be the exact strategy they used for cloverfield) but seriously the movie sucked the showing I went to everyone demanded their money back and they couldn't give away the DVD's where I was at overseas.  While I know I am not reviewing that regurgitated bile of a movie the escence of cloverfield just reeks of blairwitch to me.  From marketing to filming to not leaving any type of explanation to anything even the fate of the characters mirror the witch (possible blessing in disguise??? I mean if there is a sequel it would be pretty difficult to cast them again).  Rent this one, that is unless you liked godzilla (the one with matthew brodderick or however you spell his name) truth be told I actually prefer godzilla over this heap of monster poo.<br /><br />On a side note, noting that J.J. Abrams is also directing the latest installment in Star Trek franchise I know a number of trekkies that if gives us a movie from spock's perspective via \\"handy-cam\\" or what the heck ever they will use in the future to give it that blair witch witch feel... I am fairly confident that they will without hesitation \\"blair witch\\" him.<br /><br />*If it wasn't for the action sequences and effects that made this watchable I wouldn't have given this any stars.<br /><br />** Also NOT saying I am getting dizzy or virtigo from the \\"shaky cam\\" just don't care for it.  If I want to see a monster flick via handy cam I would record the ex-wife with mine.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian does a great job of motivating you through her fat scorching workout, and offers alternative movements for most levels of fitness. My wife has enjoyed everything about this workout, and has mixed the DVD with Jillian's book, \\"Making The Cut\\" and has been seeing results.    Our only BIG complaint is the authoring of the DVD. The ads at the beginning are easy to fast forward/skip through, but then, the Jillian \\"first time watching this DVD\\" introduction cannot be skipped. It is over five minutes long, and in a rush to squeeze in a workout in the morning before heading off to work, you have to remember to start the DVD long before you are ready to work out. I know it sounds minor, but suffer through the welcome intro a few times when you are in a rush and just want to get to your workout, and you may begin to realize how annoying it is.    Love Jillian and the workout, but PLEASE author the DVD to be easier to use with the next one!
B000J4QWMC|5.0|This movie is a crime drama, not an action movie.  Once you understand that I believe you will really like the movie.  For fans of the TV show, I think if you liked the first season, which was flashy, but had a really good and serious storyline, this is for you.  They both have the fast cars, boats, nice houses, etc.  But I actually like the characters in the movie better.  The special features are a nice addition as well.

0316010669|5.0|Sometimes decisions need to be made quickly.  All of our knowledge, education, experience, reasoning, intuition, common sense and confidence must come together rapidly.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell calls quick decision making thin slicing in his book: Blink.  Thin slicing is the ability to focus on a small set of critical variables to make a quick decision rather than consciously considering every possible variable.<br /><br />Many decisions are time dependent.  Weighing the amount of information needed before making a decision, against the time available is a challenge.<br /><br />Examples of when thin slicing is needed: combat, avoiding a car accident, or anything requiring an immediate decision.  Another common name for thin slicing is thinking on your feet.<br /><br />Gladwell does an excellent job of explaining what happens in these situations.  For example:<br /><br />\\"...in interviews with police officers who have been involved with shootings, these same details appear again and again: extreme visual clarity, tunnel vision, diminished sound, and the sense that time is slowing down.  This is how the human body reacts to extreme stress...\\"<br /><br />Besides the excellent examples given in the book, here is a classic example of using thin slicing.<br /><br />Thin slicing was used on multiple occasions during the US space program.  Gene Kranz (a flight controller on the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space programs) writes about the need for quick accurate decisions in his book: Failure is not an Option.<br /><br />Endless intensive simulations were run with the controllers, flight crew and others before every launch.  Everyone's skills had to be razor sharp during the actual missions.  Decisions had to be accurate and made in real time.  There was little, and sometimes no room for error.  Lives were at stake.  Risk was part of their business.<br /><br />Gene Kranz sums up how he gained his skills to be a top flight director when he said:<br /><br />\\"The flight director's ultimate training comes at the console, working real problems, facing the risks, making irrevocable decisions.\\"<br /><br />Although we may not be faced with life and death decisions, we will (on occasions) have to make quick decisions.  The better our skills and Critical Thinking are, coupled with training and quickness, the more prepared we will be to make sound decisions in the blink of an eye!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0595437087 The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking]]g the risks, making irrevocable decisions.\\"    Although we may not be faced with life and death decisions, we will (on occasions) have to make quick decisions.

0671027344|5.0|Although I am a 24 years old male, Yes, this is a very touching book indeed.  I finished it in a whooping 6 hours.  Why? I honestly don't know but all I have to say is I couldn't put it down.        The story is about a boy going through freshman year with no significant moments or things really occur during the entire story.  BUT the things that happened were told by a very beautiful and honest voice (I had a monotone-like voice by the narrator in my head throughout the book).  The boy is a bit weird but I have to say I loved him! I mean you can't not love him!  In the end you'd get a glimps of a part which made him the way he is.  Sam and Patrick are two great charactors which I can't take them out of my mind at all.      This is an ordinary story told in a very touching way.  It might not change your life but it will probably stay with you forever (without really being able to explain why).  Try it!, then sign and smile when you finish it, because that's what I did.      ***If you read and loved Mark Haddon's Curios Incident....then I think you'll love this.  As good as that book was for me, now I rated this book way better though!!!***
B000AP04OM|5.0|Whether young or old, it's a film that captures you right from the very beginning. The songs are sung and performed well, woven into the story almost effortlessly it seems. You'll want to sing and watch it over & over again.    Maria (wonderfully played by Julie Andrews) arrives at the Von Trapp family mansion to be governess to Captain Von Trapp's 7 children. However, what the children want is their father's love & attention, & the only way to get his attention is by playing tricks on the governesses, which has caused them to leave. Not so Maria. She weathers the tricks & reaches out to them with love & teaches them to sing.    Since the death of his wife Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) has grieved deeply, & won't allow the house with singing & laughter - anything that reminds him of her, & he runs his house like he would a ship, certain whistles mean certain things. However, during one of his frequent long absences, Maria has won over the children & brought singing back into his house. Gradually his heart is softened as Maria encourages him to get to know his children, & as music & laughter & love re-enter his life, something else he thought was long dead has come to life...loving another woman.    A great film filled with the sound of children...the sound of laughter...the sound of romance...& the sound of music!
1423101464|5.0|My son has read each book in this series from Rick Riordan. He has loved each one. We pre-ordered this book because he loved the other ones so much and it arrived the day it was released -- my son was thrilled. This series has been instrumental in keeping his interest in read alive and well. When it comes to elementary school boys, I believe you have to do whatever it takes to keep them interested and excited about reading.
0743289692|3.0|This remarkable woman has traveled the world, in time, space, and cultural dimensions in an epic journey worthy of Odysseus. Her memoir sheds much light on some of the central issues of today. Her journey commenced in one of the world's poorest non-states, Somalia, where allegiance to the tribe is paramount. The cruel rule of Siad Barre, an adherent of the communist ideology, eventually disintegrated into tribal civil war, the worst kind of war, and she wisely fled the country with her family, seeking refuge first in Saudi Arabia, to avoid the war with Ethiopia, later in Kenya to avoid the civil war. Her father was very active politically, in opposition to Barre, and as so many in that role, clearly neglected his familial obligations. She honestly discusses her tumultuous relationship with her mother. Her culture affected her profoundly, both with the anti-female dogma that imprisons a woman in her mind, and physically -- she was subjected to female sexual mutilation.<br /><br />I found Chapter 6, \\"Doubt and Defiance\\" powerful as she first begins to question some the dogma that she has been fed since birth. She is drawn to the fundamentalist message espoused by Boqol Sawm, and a milder version espoused by Sister Aziza. She identifies one of the basic causes for the appeal of fundamentalism - the social network, and their honest behavior that serves as a stark counterpoint to the corrupt Westernized elite. She was able to personally experience the hypocrisy of so many preachers (be they religious or secular) when her friend Abshir would preach his sermons of sin, and then proceed to kiss her afterwards. The section on rescuing some refugees from the Somalia-Kenya border was heartbreaking.<br /><br />Almost certainly the most critical decision she made in her life was to flee a forced marriage, and seek refuge in the Netherlands. She undertook this courageous decision, and implemented it essentially without any support. She is stunned by the orderliness and functionality of this \\"infidel\\" country, and broadens her outlook first as an interpreter, latter, she graduates from the prestigious Univ. of Leiden. In the end she rejects the faith of her birth, and makes a short movie, entitled Submission I, with the anti-female verses in the Koran painted on the bodies of semi-clad women. This lead to the brutal murder of Theo van Gogh by a Muslim fanatic. She is the target of numerous death threats herself, receives heavy security from the Dutch police, and in a sad ironic twist to her life, is stripped of her Dutch citizenship, and must seek refuge in America.<br /><br />Whew!  An incredible journey, with enough transitions to exhaust several lifetimes of \\"future shock.\\" It is only natural that alter boys who have been sexually abused by Catholic priests, or Mormons who have fled the strictures of their religion, and are labeled \\"apostates,\\" to reserve their primary animus for the religion that has abused them.  So too in Ms. Ali's case.  She reserves much anger for those who say: \\"but on the other hand.....\\", for example, p270, \\"Infuriatingly stupid analysts--especially people who called themselves Arabists, yet who seemed to know next to nothing about the reality of the Islamic world--wrote reams of commentary. Their articles were all about Islam saving Aristotle and the zero.....  These were fairy tales, nothing to do with the real world I knew.\\"<br /><br />As she finds herself in yet another world, with her critical intellect, might it be possible that she do a \\"Submission II\\"?  Imagine the verses of the Bible that are both despicably cruel and anti-female painted on female bodies.  There is no shortage of them: Leviticus 21:9, on the requirement to burn prostitutes; Deuteronomy 22:23, on stoning a virgin who was \\"in town\\" and had sex; Leviticus 20:18 on the exiling of a married couple for having sex during her period.  That is a very short list, all believed to be the absolute word of God, by fundamentalist Christians and Jews. She might also realize that religion is only one mechanism for keeping \\"women in their place.\\"  She might read Susan Faludi's seminal book, \\"Backlash--The Undeclared War Against American Women.\\"  \\"Islam\\" is not in the index to this book. Most of what Ms. Faludi painfully documents has nothing to do with any religion--mainly it is secular actions that have been taken to keep the women down--in America, certainly including removing the Equal Rights Amendment from American political discourse.<br /><br />In terms of those \\"Infuriatingly stupid analysts,\\" who raise inconvenient questions like:  Why have Muslim countries such as Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia all had women in the number one political leadership position, yet the United States and France never have?; she might articulate an answer other than we are stupid.<br /><br />She concludes her book with: \\"But to me, there is far worse moral corruption in Islamic countries. In those societies, cruelty is implacable and inequality is the law of the land. Dissidents are tortured (!)...  (Exclamation point added) p350. She might want to read Robert Sheer's \\"Cri de Coeur\\" on America's open adoption of torture, and endless imprisonment without charge as published on TruthDig. She now works for the American Enterprise Institute, the very heartland of the neocon ideology of the promotion of endless war (see the excellent BBC documentary, \\"The Power of Nightmares.\\")  The AEI has some of the most prominent neocons on their staff: Irving Kristol, Richard Pearle, Paul Wolfowitz and perhaps most infamously, John Yoo, who is the principal architect of providing the legal basis, and absolution from prosecution, for torture.<br /><br />I'm rooting for her.  The journey is not complete. She can revisit her Chapter 6, \\"Doubt and Defiance,\\" with the neocon tribe, and realize their own \\"black and white\\" ideology of cruel, endless war against the other to be, in large measure, the flip side of those Islamic fanatics that she so rightly detests. I might even suggest a title for her next book:  \\"What I discussed around the water cooler with John Yoo?\\"gion is only one mechanism for keeping \\"women in their place.\\"  She might read Susan Faludi's seminal book, \\"Backlash--The Undeclared War Against American Women.\\"  \\"Islam\\" is not in the index to this book.

B000QCQ9O8|5.0|Ian McEwan's novel, Atonement, is a story of chance encounters that disrupt even the most carefully controlled lives.  Set in England during the period between the two World Wars with a leap to the present, the plans of members of a wealthy family are changed because of the conscious misperceptions of a creative child, Briony.  Because of her disingenuous account of an assault that takes place on the family's estate, irreversible life paths are set for  the characters, and the reader is aware of the novelist's deliberate plot decisions.<br /><br />The beautifully written story follows the lives of the characters most affected by Briony's embellishment of her observations and her desire to tell stories, to become a novelist.  McEwan presents a novel within a novel and surprises the reader on many occasions with plot twists. He has a very good ability to give the reader insight into the characters' motivations, describing reasons for their life changing choices.<br /><br />The most impressive aspect of Atonement is McEwan's illustration of the power of a life review, the revisiting of personal history by a person as she gains wisdom through aging. In Brionys' life review, initiated both consciously and by chance encounters with people and cues from the environment, a resolution of her life is achieved.  The task of aging is atonement through memories, a unity of the story of the self and a personal history with others. The most difficult conclusion to reach is that upon looking back, it all makes sense.

Everyone we teach it to seems extremely bored with the list of rules at first, but once they play it once, they are begging to come over and play it more. The rules are somewhat complicated in the beginning, but after playing the game several times, everything makes perfect sense. A great game that actually requires some strategy and thinking.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna delighted me with Confessions and I still enjoy watching the concert DVD.  Hard Candy is quite a bit different but is not a hip hop cd like some say.  It is still Madonna just some new twists to her music.    DO NOT think that 4 minutes is how the entire CD will sound.  I like 4 minutes but you get more of Madonna once you hear the entire CD.    Incredible is one of my favorite songs on the CD.  Very uplifting!    I love the new cd and cannot wait for the Hard Candy tour.    DJ,  Gaypartyblog.com
038533348X|5.0|This book is full of whimsical humor. It's one of the few books that made me laugh out loud. Ironically, it's also incredibly pessimistic. Humanity is doomed by its own depraved nature to a farcical apocalypse. For Vonnegut, the main culprits are scientists who show no concern for the destructive applications of their inventions. Their scientific method is the only road to knowledge but (more pessimism) cannot yield moral knowledge or wisdom. Nothing can, including religion, which is 'all lies'.

B00169XU8I|5.0|This album is perfect to celebrate 25 years of career. It has a lot of her R&B roots. The Special Edition package is beautiful and tasteful. Once she was asked: \\"what do you hope for the future?\\" and the anwer was \\"to rule the world\\". 25 years later we have no doubt she made it!  My only complaint in this album is Spanish Lesson... Well, it's Madonna... I don't mind

B000WTNCYA|5.0|Through the first 5 months of 2008, the most remarkable thing about this year to date, in the field of vocal jazz, is the plethora of really promising young singers, mining the field of jazz-pop.  (Though actually, this trend dates back earlier than that; it's just that it's really prominent this year).  Raya Yarbrough, Hope Waits, and now Melody Gardot have all put out first-rate debut c.d.'s, all excellently produced, in this sub-genre.<br /><br />What separates Ms. Gardot from the rest (including other jazz-pop chanteusses such as Erin Bode, Sara Gazarek, Judith Owens, Jackie Allen and the like), however, is that all of these tunes are originals - and, incidentally,  all are really, really good.  Melody does \\"melody\\" very well.  She has great promise, just as a songwriter.<br /><br />According to what I can read into the liner notes, a good chunk of this c.d. was recorded in the dead of night, 2 years after her near-fatal auto accident.  I well believe it.  The songs seem to range between whimsy (e.g., track #2, \\"All That I Need to Love\\") and atmospheric (e.g., track #8, \\"Love Me Like a River Does,\\" my favorite here), and have that close examination and clarity of time that only the middle of the night on a second wind can bring.<br /><br />With songs this well written, it's tempting to compare Ms. Gardot with Joni Mitchell.  But really, I think a more apt comparison is with Paul Simon.  In songs like the above, as well as \\"Sweet Memory,\\" \\"Quiet Fire,\\" and \\"Goodnite,\\" I hear echoes of \\"59th Street Bridge Song,\\" \\"Punky's Dilemma\\" and \\"El Condor Pasa.\\"<br /><br />As I mentioned above, this is an excellently produced c.d.  The sound is clean and in tune, and the addition of violin, clarinet, trumpet, lap steel guitar and dobro make for most arresting arrangements.<br /><br />I could see some jazz artist in the distant future redoing these songs in a completely different vein, and turning it into an equally impressive recording.  Such is the case with great songs.  Here's hoping that Melody Gardot becomes that good and that prominent as to inspire such future recordings.  RC<br /><br />P.s. - 11/26/08:  This is my favorite c.d. for 2008.  Rarely have I heard a c.d. that has so much depth to it, that is so simple and so complex at the same time.  Listening to this is like having a ribeye steak and Ruth-Chris':  it sticks with you, long after the meal is over.  RCthat good and that prominent as to inspire such future recordings.

B00102F5WK|3.0|Watched this movie a few nights ago. Good acting on all counts by actors with so-so storyline. A man is suspected of terrorism and kidnapped to foreign soil to be held in a prisoner in a jail while they torture him in order to get a confession...    In the meantime, the prisoner's wife, an American citizen, is worried sick about the disappearance of her husband and goes about trying to find out why he never made it home from a business trip overseas.    Once her husband returns home, things are the same. He has witnesses brutality and trauma that an ordinary person never encounters and she wonders if he was ever involved in terrorism or not. How life changes on a dime that changes the way one sees things forever.
B0013GUKDC|5.0|I read Diary of a Wimpy Kid for my class book report.  It was hilarious.  I really liked how Greg Heffley was friends with Rowley, who was sort of a nerd.  Greg didn't have a lot of friends but he was a good friend to Rowley.  My favorite part was when their school had a comics contest to see which student could draw the best comic.  Greg won but then the school math teacher changed his comic and made it awkward and about math.  The pictures were an important part of the book because it was a diary and Greg drew pictures about what he did.  I learned that keeping a diary a secret can be dangerous, in case somebody looks at it.  I would change some of the words in the book that my mom said are bad and used better words.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|This movie is too long and too slow.... I think that it could have been made into a much shorter length movie and made its point in much less time then the 2.5 hours it took to do so.    The acting on all counts by all cast members was magnificent. Daniel Day Lewis is perfect for the role of Daniel Plainview, the single-minded individual whose sole purpose in life is to get rich through mining oil.... Daniel Plainview is an entirely ruthless individual whom isn't above lying and using any other devious means necessary to obtain what he wants.... Primarily money, wealth, success and power. Plainview doesn't have friends and hates humanity at large and is unwavering in his behavior throughout the entire movie. It is a bit difficult to believe anyone could be this callous, ruthless, and downright mean as Daniel Plainview.... He's almost one dimensional because he is so one sided in his callousness.    This movie seems to represent what one will do out of greed/hunger for money and conquest. It is as if the ends justify the means no matter what the cost is.

B0013527I4|4.0|Season 3 of the Muppet Show is one I have been waiting for a long time.  Most of these episodes are one I haven't seen, and I enjoying watching them for the first time.  I love the Harry Belafonte episode more that ever before.    A few things make me rate this set 4 out of 5 stars.    First, as others have noticed, no Muppet Morsels.  The First season DVD was awesome because it gave some behind the scenes information that Muppet fans really want to know about.  And I thought that since it was in the first season it would continue through the rest of the series.  Sadly, it's missing in Seasons 2 AND 3.    Second, the 10 minute mini-documentary \\"Company of Players\\" is just too short!  It looked like there was a lot of footage taken from the old Muppet performers in interviews, and I could easily see that this could have stretched out at least an hour.  Again, Muppet fans want to see and hear what it was like during the zany times on the show.    And thirdly - and this is technical issue - It seems that on my copy of the DVD, that the second disk was authored incorrectly.  Anytime I go the \\"Episode Selection\\" screen and choose Helen Reddy's episode, Alice Cooper's starts instead.  The only way I could watch the Helen Reddy episode is to \\"Play All\\" and skip all the scenes until her episode started.    Overall, this season of the Muppet is the best in video and audio quality, and is definitely worth picking up.  If a few things could be added, this would have been a 5 star pick.      But because of the aforementioned concerns, I give it 4 out 5 stars.
B00005JPO1|1.0|I know many like this movie and many are on on the fence. I mean no disrespect to any body with this review as we all have our own opinions and the world would be a boring placed if we all liked the same things...     ....But this time you're all wrong...it sucked!!! ;0)     ****SPOILERS*****    Indy movies should be in the realm of the semi-believable, and as soon as I knew we were in Area 51 looking for an alien body my heart sank!     The Ark is fabulous McGuffin and the Stones in Temple of Doom where so understated they worked a treat and the Holy Grail was an inspired choice. Crystal Skulls on the other hand turned this fourth installment into a cheap, National Treasure meets Tomb Raider meets X-Files and the whole aliens teaching the Mayan's how to plow a field plotline and draw pictures on mountains does the Mayan's an incredible injustice.     Add to all this some terrible and stupidly conceived comedy moments. CGI Prarie Dogs with cartoon emotions, Mutt turning into Tarzan, CGI monkeys that are magnetically attracted to Russian baddies. The whole Atomic bomb testing and hiding in a fridge nonesense, the constant jabbering about the Skulls every 15 minutes just in case we've forgotten what this was all about. Even the action scenes felt so over-the-top with too much crammed in there just because we can in these CGI infested days. Mutt's sword fight was just laughable, as he manages to balance between two jeeps, perry and attack and get hit in the nuts by plants while travelling at 90mph. The falling down Niagra Falls there times and everyone survives and the Skull is still in one piece. Then there's the whole space ship taking off at the end? I was just clutching my head saying to myself \\"Please don't let this be a big flying saucer, Please don't let this be a big flying saucer\\" but alas it was!     For the past few years we were told this would be a film for Indy fans, 30-40 year olds would be the people that this movie was aimed at. How could Lucas' and Spielberg's aim be as bad as the gun totting Russian's in this movie. Lucas has treaded this ground before with his absimal attemp at reviving the Star War franchise, which he admits he wrote for himself and not the fans, and this all smacks of the same badly written, poor dialogue and non-essential craziness he had in those films. Is Spielberg responsible for the alien angle, as he does seems to have soft spot for the bug eyed other worlders?     I can't put into words how dissapointed I was when I left the theatre last night. I had a mix of emotions from stunned to anger. I'd love to see the rejected scripts and hope that these were as bad as the Lucas/Koepp's. After reading a few non-spoiler reviews of this movie before I saw it I was open minded and wanted to love this movie as much as I did the previous outings but as I now read more and more reviews I get the feeling there is some brainwashing going on out there. I can't believe true Indy fans would look at this film and say \\"Yeah it has a real Indy feel\\" because it fails almost everywhere. I say almost because I thought Mr Ford was brilliant and his age wasn't a factor or distraction at all. Shia also performed well when not swinging on vines, fencing or combing his hair. On the other hand Karen Allen felt like she'd been out of the acting loop for a while and her character wasn't in keeping with her gutsy, head strong performance as Marion in the first movie. Ray Winstone was a charicature and yeah Indy movies have these but they've been done better. Cate Blanchett's Irina Spalko was very one dimensional compared to previous villains, Belloq or Walter Donovan. There were a few glimmers of true Indy during the search for the Skull but not enough to make this a film I would happily watch again let alone multiple times.     Like the new Star Wars movies this fourth Indy outing will never have room on my DVD shelf and is another poor second-cousin-twice-removed to a series of classic movies I still love to watch over and over.     Lucas and Spielberg sould be ashamed...very ashamed!     Oly

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|As an ardent Summer fan I have been waiting for years for this CD. It hasnt been officially released over here yet but thanks to AMAZON I now have a copy of the US (albeit without the bonus track 'it's only love) release, and it hasnt left my CD player yet.    What to make of this 'colourful Summer' - like her 1987 release All Systems Go and 1991's Mistaken Identity at first listen it sounds strange and unlike anything she has recorded previously. But like those two releases which  have divided camps (those that love them and those that dont) Crayons grows on you each time you listen to it and is destined again like the aforementioned CDS to become one of my all time favourite Donna Summer recordings.    It's interesting that many people still perceive Summer as a 'disco artist' when in fact she has been anything but since 1980's The Wanderer (which was pure Rock), Summer as an artist has never been afraid to experiment and refuses to be pigeonholed into one particular category. Crayons allows her to really let her creative juices flow from the rousing anthem Stamp Your Feet, to the Bluesy Slide Over Backwards (another voice in her already Chameleonlike range - just awesome) to the retro disco of I'm A Fire. The title track Crayons featuring Ziggy Marley is catchy and should be a sure fire Summer Hit. Whilst Science Of Love with its excellent vocals could be another pop hit single - to me it has a throwback feel to the 80's (and could easily fit on All Systems Go).    My favourite has to be the acoustic sounding ballad Sand On My feet and the spine tingling Be Myself again.     Donna Summer is an icon, a legend and a True Talent that has endured, all hail the return of THE QUEEN. Do not miss the opportunity to rediscover the many colours of Summer.    One minor gripe is with the 'marketing' of the CD and the emphasis on the '17 years' which makes it sound as if Summer has been idle all those years...yes it has been 17 years since Mistaken Identity but Summer has released many quality singles including: I Got Your Love, I will Go With You, You're So Beautiful, Hits Compilations A Christmas CD, a Live album and dvd, and an autobiography which have kept her in the public eye.

B0007ZEO4G|5.0|I have hundreds of CD's, tapes, records and downloads.    Burn is?    BEST.ALBUM.EVER.    The remaster really brings out the music of the bass and clarifies all the instruments perfectly. Vocals (David & Glenn) are amazing, Blackmore was at his peak on guitar, Lord was loving the organ and synths, Paicey's work on the title track and You Fool No One is as good as anything you're likely to hear and above all the songs, music and melodies sing to me more than any other offering in HISTORY.     I can't say anything more than just BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0015519VS|3.0|His CD can best be compared to a Napoleon Dynamite or Anchorman, you must listen to it a second time to really appreciate it.  I'm going to be honest, the first time I listened to it I was like this is a 2.5 at best.  Half way through the cd, I'm thinking to myself \\"are you serious\\" and then the second half came and he redeemed himself.  So the first listen it was a tale of two halves, then I listened to it again all the way through rating each song and i would say my thoughts on the cd jumped a star to 3.5.  It takes awhile to get used to Usher in a true R&B role rather than his usual hybrid R&B/Pop style.    Standouts (In my opinion):  What's Your Name  Before I Met You (Favorite)  Lifetime    Good Songs (ditto):  Love You Gently  Best Thing  His Mistakes  Here I Stand (kinda sounds like a track by Musiq)    All in all, like everybody has said...Grown up ish...not for high schoolers or college aged kids really.  Still a good listen though, just be patient and let it soak in!!!
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Russel Crowe is excellent in this adventure movie.  It is well done and acted all around.  I'd watch it again and again.  j
6305313687|5.0|Hands down, this is an amazing movie.  There is very little to find wrong with this movie.<br /><br />The acting is by far the highlight of this film.  While not his breakout role, this is the first movie where Norton really showed he was a star.  He goes from downright scary to completely likable through the movie.  More importantly, its a transition you really believe.<br /><br />Furlong, who bothers me a lot, mostly it's his voice, also puts in a good performance.  The rest of the cast also adds a lot to the movie.  I am a fan of Ethan Suplee, and this is role is one of the reasons.  Also Fairuza Balk puts in a sold performance.  And Avery Brooks, always a winner, really comes through.  I think Brooks puts in the second best performance, next to Norton, of the whole film.  In a movie with the caliber of acting, thats saying something.<br /><br />The story itself is uplifting in it's own way, but still very dark.  This is definitely a drama, so anyone looking for lighter fair should steer clear.  Normally I am not a fan of flashbacks, but they are handled very well.  The pacing is dead on, and the viewer is not left wondering how much time is left until the movie is over.<br /><br />This is a quality flick, one of my all time favorites, and a must see for any moviegoer.
0061537934|5.0|I just finished both a master's degree and National Board Certification and I chose this to be my first pleasure reading book after all of that. I chose wisely. I admit it. I'm a dog person. And this book was recommended from one of many websites I visited one day. When I read the summary on amazon I pre-ordered both the book and the audio CDs. The CDs came first and I started listening to Christopher Evan Welch's exquisite performance of Enzo and all of the other characters. But listening on the way to and from work is slow going so when the book arrived I quickly read through it to the end in one night. I loved it. But I was so disappointed it was finished. So...I've continued to listen to the CDs even though I've finished reading the book. I don't re-read that many books but I will be keeping this one to re-read. I've already started recommending this book to others. If I have a chance to form a book-club, this will be the first book I recommend. You don't have to be a fan of race cars or dogs to enjoy this book. There is plenty in this book to relate to what we all know. \\"The car goes where the eye goes.\\"
B0011HOEY4|4.0|This was a decent bio-pic that I for the most part really enjoyed.  While it has it's problems, it is worth a watch.<br /><br />The performances are good, but not outstanding.  Washington gave his now standard hard-nosed straight shooter performance we have seen from him many times.  While I like him, it would be nice to see some range.  Crow also stayed with his normal performance, which has never had range.  He managed to take a conflicted character and make him fairly run-of-the-mill.  Both men held their role together and didn't negetively affect the movie, but also didn't shine.  The only performance I really had a problem with was Brolin.  I am of mixed opinions whether the dumbed down, one shade crocked cop was his doing, or the writing.  I actually liked Cuba Gooding Jr. in his role.  He took an obnoxious character and ran with it, playing it to the hilt.  I also really liked Ric Young's performance.  He and Washington really played off each other, and you could sense the characters general affection for each other.<br /><br />The writing itself is passable, but again, doesn't shine.  The Brolin sub-plot is down right boring, the crocked ex-partner is un-interesting, and most everything not directly connected to Washington's character feels like a different movie.<br /><br />What makes this movie more then just a three start run of the mill bio-pic is the story of Bumpy Johnson. The man was interesting, and it is what carries everything.  Also, the rise of the Harlem drug trade and the dynamics of the gang control of the area is also fascinating.<br /><br />As a straight up film, this movie is run of the mill.  If you are interested in bio-pics or crime drama, pick this up, otherwise watch it when you have a chance, but don't go out of your way.
193355021X|5.0|Hazlitt's short book outlines a simple, yet devastating case for voluntary co-operation and the free market. This is a classic expansion of Bastiat's \\"what is seen and what is not seen\\" analysis applied to a modern industrial economy. Should be the introductory text for anyone interested in economics and govt.
B00003CXMG|4.0|This is a movie I really enjoyed.  While it is definitely in Crowe's voice, it is a fairly unique movie and has a lot of charm.  This is essentially a film about family, both actual families and adopted families of friends, with all the problems this entails.<br /><br />The performances range from really good, to decent.  Fugit does a passable job, although he still comes off as a kind of annoying kid.  While this doesn't kill the movie or anything, it does let him get overshadowed by much of the rest of the case.  MCDormand and Deschanel both put in great performances, and are really likable.  You feel that this is the guys family with them.  Hoffman of course steals the scenes he is in, but this is to be expected.  Jason Lee, who before this movie was know for comedy, also really carries his scenes, and it is easy to see how he keeps getting work and increasing notoriety.  The two real standouts for me were Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson.  Both delivered very real performances, showing a huge range of emotion though the film and really portraying broken people.<br /><br />The writing itself is for the most part good.  The story is very believable.  Since this is somewhat autobiographical, this is to be expected.  A problem this film does have is pacing.  It really drags in some parts and could have had a better flow.  It is a nice looking film, but not so to the point you will think about the visuals later.<br /><br />The music should also be mentioned.  There are some really good performances and some just good music scattered throughout.  The performance of Tiny Dancer in particular is spectacular.<br /><br />This is a good, if somewhat slow movie.  For someone who loves drama, this is a must see.
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|I'm glad I bought this album.  That said it wasn't quite what I expected from Portishead.  P3 is less melodic and often electronic elements disrupt the experience.  Perhaps that is the point but for me the album Dummy created spaces where you could lose yourself in the music.  Anytime you start to do that in P3 your abruptly brought back to the surface.  Very happy to get to listen to new Portishead.
1552091090|1.0|The lesson is to prescreen any children's book prior to reading it to my grandchildren. No matter who it comes from. As this came from a good friend who I thought was reasonably intact upstairs. From first opening the package, I wasn't certain what I would think. I love a beautifully illustrated children's book. This is far from beautifully illustrated, even prior to reaching the ick factor.   The song the mother sings is very sweet and certainly a testimony to love. Had I sung that to my babies and they had loved it, I would not hesitate to sing it to them as they were older or include the lyrics in a card or letter.   In spite of my disatisfaction with the cover and because my friend had raved about the book so much, I eagerly placed my grandson in my lap and rocked him as I read. I stopped and said \\"the end\\" as I reached the rather perverse page depicting the mother crawling across the floor to her sleeping teenage son's bed, staring at him and then lifting him into her lap. When I finished looking through the book later, I pondered what my own three grown sons reaction would have been to waking up to that in the dead of night as teens. When I got to the part of her taking a ladder across town to climb up his house and crawl through his window in the dead of night, I pondered my husband doing that to our two grown daughters. Explain that one to a passing law enforcement officer. Although as a middle aged woman myself, I must admire the strength the mom possesses. I would not be capable of lifting my adult sons into my lap without waking them.  I realize the intent of this book is to be a shining example of the unconditional love of a mother and child through the years. Surely there is a way to communicate that without being perverse. Considering the author is a man, I worry for his mother to son relationship growing up. It's amazing what one can think is normal if it's all they ever knew.
B000058B2W|5.0|I saw the band playing this album at the Colston Hall in Bristol and it was unusual to be so moved by songs not heard before. PH is probably the most under-rated band in the world: this is a superb album.     Stand-outs are Strong as Sampson, The Idol (Mick Grabham's finest hour with PH), Beyond the Pale - in fact, all of it. The playing is, as ever, first-class, world class, and Brooker's straining urgent vocals never sounded better. Strong as Sampson even has BJ Cole on pedal steel, whom I had the pleasure of meeting when my old mate Mike Wedgwood was playing in Kiki Dee's band with him. This is majestic, well thought out, brilliantly played and important music. I cannot recommend highly enough, even if you loathe PH. B J Wilson was one of rock's best and most underrrated drummer, along with Rod De'Ath from Rory Gallagher's brilliant band, and here he gives a lesson in economical brilliance and power, not to mention timing.    And they're still at it. The Well's On Fire is another excellent album recorded only a few years back. And they're still fantastic live.    File under indispensible. As important as Air Cut by Curved Air (see my review).

B0015519VS|1.0|I have to give him at least one star for trying after four years. I have to say that if this was the last album of his career, then he has lost his luster.      I purchased this yesterday (5/28) and was very excited and almost hesitant at the same time because I hadn't heard anything good or bad, and so I thought I'd hear it for myself. I would really like my money back (I don't understand why there isn't a better return policy on music like other software :)). Every song was \\"uneventful\\" and I heard nothing new and fresh. My friend and I looked at each other after every song and we could only sigh, we were very disapointed. He wouldn't even take it to load to his IPOD.      Here is my problem with this album: It's all over the place! He is singing about the same things as before however, he is also including his new family,and in fact has an interlude to his son, yet 2 or 3 songs bfore he is talking about \\"sex\\" and other inuendos and it just seems odd considering he is now \\"married\\" to someone that adds no luster to his persona. Usher sings about the ladies, dancing and inuendos...Mr.Raymond is married with a son, he shouldn't mingle the two as it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and speechless.       SEcondly, the beats, with the exception of \\"What's your Name\\" with Will.I.Am is hot, but that's it, the beat..not the lyrics or the music. If you haven't already purchased \\"Confessions\\", purchase that instead of this one.      Sorry, Usher, but this one will not make it to my IPOD!

B00005JPNZ|2.0|***Contains Spoilers***<br /><br />I just went to see the new Indiana Jones film yesterday evening, and I've got to say that I found the movie disappointing. I have been a big fan of the Indiana Jones series (including the Young Indiana Jones movies), and was wowed by Raiders of the Lost Ark when it came out three decades ago (four stars). I was much less impressed by its unworthy sequel, Temple of Doom (two stars), and relieved by the excellent recovery of the series in Last Crusade (three and a half stars). My rating of two and a half stars for the current, and hopefully last, iteration of the Indiana Jones saga is based on comparisons with its three illustrious predecessors. My bottom line: Lucas and Spielberg should have quite while they were ahead.<br /><br />One of the great selling points for \\"Raiders\\" and \\"Crusade\\" was that while there was plenty in each of these movies that was inexplicable, such as the powers of the Ark or the Grail, if you accepted the premise that the Ark or the Grail did exist and had magical powers, the rest of the story held together quite well. You could suspend disbelief a little bit and actually convince yourself that Harrison Ford/Indiana Jones really could get out of all those tight situations with nothing more than slightly mussed hair and a thoroughly dented fedora.<br /><br />Try that approach with \\"Crystal Skull\\" and you get nowhere. The Roswell/ El Dorado mythology is obscure and unbelievable, with enough plot holes to drive a pyramid-sized flying saucer through. Most comic books have a better thought-out plot. Worse still, the situations Indiana Jones gets into are clearly not survivable, unless he has morphed into a combination of Superman and the Hulk, and this detracts significantly from the entertainment value of the film. For example, surviving a nuclear blast by jumping into a nearby lead-lined refrigerator is a non-starter in every sense, as is the survival of all of our heroes through serial descents over three waterfalls. In addition, the marksmanship of AK-47 bearing Soviet troopers has to be truly execrable not to hit Indiana Jones or his compadres even once. This is not the 1930's, when one could reasonably evade a pistol shot here and there. An AK will cut through the jungle, and metal, like it wasn't there and kill everything in range. Indiana should have been killed a hundred times over by this alone,and, in any case, his old man running style didn't help me believe that he could somehow dodge all those bullets.<br /><br />I also have a few quibbles with the general storyline and casting choices. Nazis in the Middle East in the 1930s is one thing, but an entire Soviet army unit trundling around the Nevada desert and taking over the equivalent of Area 51 is not. It makes you think that those 1950s FBI guys who saw a commie under every bed might have been on to something. In addition, although Cate Blanchett is definitely nice to look at, she is miscast as the KGB villain of the piece. Her attempts at Russian were admirable, but still had my native-Russian speaking girlfriend in stitches. Somebody should have checked a Russian grammar text once in awhile.<br /><br />I also felt that the transition between the Area 51 warehouse and the nuclear test site was a bit inexplicable. What were those rogue Soviet soldiers doing driving around the test site, and what happened to the rest of them, including Cate Blanchett? The car chase scene through the University was sort of fun, but let's face it: there really would be no such thing as a race between a Harley and a Buick with portholes: it would be over in the first three seconds, with the Harley disappearing rapidly over the horizon. I also found myself scratching my head a little bit over the role played by Ray Winstone as the double/triple agent. His character was totally predictable and entirely superfluous. Shia LaBoeuf's performance as Indiana's long-lost son had some entertainment value, but, once again, I found that he seemed to be something of a fifth wheel at times, whether it was swinging through the jungle with a troupe of CGI monkeys, or engaging in thoroughly ridiculous swordplay with Cate Blanchett. It was great to see Karen Allen reprise her role as Marion Ravenwood, and the sparks that flew between her and Indiana were real and believable, although she did overact at times. I always like to see John Hurt, but his great talents as an actor were wasted in a role where he spent most of his time either spaced out or semi-comatose.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes was at the beginning of the film, when Indy was in his office looking fondly at the pictures of his recently departed father (Sean Connery) and his professorial colleague (Denholm Elliott). Unfortunately, it reminded me of how good \\"Last Crusade\\" was in comparison to the current film. Connery must be thanking his lucky stars that he was written out of this \\"Alien City of Gold\\" fiasco. Lucas and Spielberg will probably make a ton of money on this movie, but it will do nothing for their reputations. They should have quit while they were ahead.times, whether it was swinging through the jungle with a troupe of CGI monkeys, or engaging in thoroughly ridiculous swordplay with Cate Blanchett.

0563486430|4.0|One of the many reasons I love this novel is I happen to love Roman history.  I also happen to love Doctor Who, science fiction, and the tenth Doctor.  I also like Rose and found their visit to ancient Rome a delight.  It seems that they have found a statue of Rose in a modern museum, a 2000 year old statue, and they realize that the TARDIS will soon be making a stop there, so why not go now?  So off they go.  But, of course, they find themselves in a trap of their own design.  For the Doctor tumbles across a hideous truth, a truth that could screw up history and maybe, just maybe, get Rose killed.
0735619670|5.0|When I bought this book, I couldn't believe all the 5 star ratings in the reviews.  But, now that I've finished it, I have to agree with them.  Simply put, this is probably the best computer-related book I've read.  In the book's 850 pages, I found a grand total of five minor problems:  one was grammatical, two were typographical and two were minor disagreements with how some things were presented.  All trivial.  Content-wise, if the universities would teach this material and if programmers would follow the methodologies contained in the book, the world of software would be far, far better off.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book and rate it an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.

B000FGGERM|5.0|Let me just start off by saying that I agree with some of my fellow reviewers in that I usually don't care much for the black metal style vocals. Usually that style vocal can really take away from an otherwise great metal song.  Opeth is something different entirely. Mikael Akerfelt, the singer/songwriter for Opeth is in my opinion the most talented man in music today. Everything, I mean everything he writes into his music has a purpose, even the black metal style vocals. Its obvious that he is influenced by so many styles of music. (I've heard that he likes prog masters Camel just much as Bathory.) Akerfelt's guitar tones are superb as are both his singing and screaming vocals. Every part of an epic Opeth tune has meaning. Give yourself a break and just go ahead and buy everything Opeth has every recorded. You won't be sorry. If you like good music and you are willing to have an open mind you WILL be impressed. Remember to have an open mind. Just let the music wash over you and blow your mind!
B000069KE0|5.0|I agree with others that this \\"early Chicago\\" is their best. Great instrumentalists (particularly Terry Kath's guitar and Danny Seraphine's drums) and very musically interesting songs with long-lined atypical (but still singable) melodic lines and song structures -- not your usual pop Verse Chorus Verse Chorus Bridge Chorus Chorus pattern.     \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" is famous of course, and very catchy, in a more conventional mode (but with a fabulous instrumental section). \\"In the Country\\" is equally good, especially with Terry Kath's lead vocals, assisted ably by Peter Cetera. The two long suites (Better End Soon and the Wake Up Sunshine \\"Ballet\\") provide a stimulating different path from conventional \\"songs\\" at all.  In that sense, some of it is almost \\"classical\\" in form.     The instrumental jams pack a lot of power, and though they have a lot of dissonance, it isn't painful to listen to.     The political \\"down with the system\\" message sounds earnest, though I wonder what ever happened to that anger as Chicago evolved into the poppy ballad-oriented band later in their career (I forget exactly when, but in Chicago V they were still pretty protest-oriented in songs like Dialogue).     Whether you agree with or care about their lyrics, though, it's the musical energy that carries this album to excellence.
B00005JPNY|2.0|The graphics are wonderful but the screen writer should be drawn and quartered. If you haven't read the book, or even read it recently there is no way to follow the story. I'm extremely disappointed in the movie but it did make me go back and read the book again after quite a few years. Again, the graphics are amazing and that is why I will watch it once more but from there it may go on the shelf to gather \\"DUST\\".
0756404746|5.0|This is an exceptionally well written book. While the story slows a bit at some points, overall the plot pacing is excellent. This is a great read.
B000EDWL82|2.0|...ever since bands like Interpol popped up there have been so many bands that wish to redo the post punk sound that Joy Division generated before passing on (R.I.P Ian Curtis) and of course Editor are not only not an exception to this rule...but they were actually later than the other bands which makes them seem like they're trying to resuscitate a corpse that has already been paraded around the land and then left in a pool of brine.    ...I will describe the sound of Editors very simply this way:    1. Blatant imitation of Ian Curtis' vocals.    2. Guitars are always high up the fret board just alternate picking to four times the original pulse.    3. Bass is surprisingly melodic...but very low in the mix.    4. Drums...well...simple a word? You can judge the drums...    ...if you've heard the songs \\"All Sparks\\", \\"Blood\\", and \\"Munich\\" you will notice all of these traits...and of course it's what you should expect from this album...    ...my advice is that if you're a fan of the post-post-punk sound and you are a completist of all eras then you should get this...however; if you've listened to bands like Interpol and have had enough of this era already...then give it a miss and allow Joy Division to rest with the dignity that it deserves(?)...

You feel sorry for the parents of the shooter and how painful it must be to question everything you did or did not do in raising your child that grew up to do something so horrific.<br />I thought it was an easy read and did not get lost like some reviewers. I thought the characters were well developed. I could not put it down but when I did I was dreaming about it.

B0013URJTG|5.0|This is a Re-issue/Re-master of Porcupine Tree's ~ Lightbulb Sun, which was originally released in 2000. Most of the songs are unchanged. The bass and kick drum are more present in the 2008 mix than the 2000 mix and \\"Rest will flow\\" is slowed down just a bit, that is it.    The album delivers a wide variety of music, from the harder riffs in \\"Hatesong\\" and \\"Russia on Ice\\" to a softer edge with \\"Last Chance....\\" and \\"Rest Will Flow\\". This album is very diverse and well rounded. While I personally do not consider it to be one of Porcupine Tree's strongest works, it is by no means weak. Any fan of PT should purchase this album, it is fantastic!    The re-master also comes with a 5.1 DVD-A mix of the album. Which also contains 5.1 mixes of the original 2000 recording. As well as several bonus tracks only in 5.1    The double CD set comes housed in a very nice and durable Super Jewel Case with a cardboard sleeve and booklet.

B00005JPNZ|5.0|So, based on some reviews I've read and comments I've seen from viewers on TV...apparently INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDON OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is supposed to have been a life-changing movie.  At least a groundbreaking film sure to vault to \\"all-time classic\\" status.  Because there sure are a lot of disappointed viewers around.    If, however, you have the more reasonable expectation of a highly-entertaining, highly-implausible action film that hearkens back to the \\"cliff-hanger\\" brand of old-school adventure...but gussied up with all the modern technology can bring...then you'll be fairly well satisfied.    Let me get to the \\"bad\\" stuff first...the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  Without giving too much away, let me just say that the quest Indiana Jones finds himself on is not terribly interesting on its own.  The bad-guys are Soviets (led by a hugely over-the-top Cate Blanchett as Irina) are in the US to snag a crystal skull from the same storage warehouse that the \\"Lost Ark\\" was hidden at the end of that film.  This unusual artifact can apparently bestow some great powers when it is returned to its home in a lost kingdom in the Amazon.  Naturally, the Soviets want to do that.  Indiana, for various reasons, is compelled to thwart their efforts.  At the end, when all the key characters are assembled in this hidden temple...the payoff is actually unexciting.  You just don't quite understand what is happening, and it feels, quite frankly, like the final scenes of either NATIONAL TREASURE movie.  Overblown sets and not much excitement.  I was disappointed that these scenes were all the movie was leading up to.    Here's the good stuff:  the movie has several truly outstanding action sequences...including a lengthy chase scene through the jungles of the Amazon.  It involves trucks, jeeps, machine guns, fistfights on the backs of these vehicles, much leaping from jeep to another, giant ants, playful monkeys, wild rivers, waterfalls and more.  It is wildly unbelievable yetI found myself laughing in delight, cringing in anxiety and marveling at the technical skill.  All the while, Harrison Ford served as the droll centerpiece...agile yet admitting his age.  I was so delighted by this long scene that I nearly burst into applause...but I was certainly smiling in gratitude for such a breathless good time.    A motorcycle chase is loads of fun too, as is Indy's initial brush with the Soviets, which leads to a very funny scene involving an atomic explosion (don't ask...just see for yourself).      Harrison Ford is certainly older, but he's as wiry as ever and if anything, the age has made his world-weary irony fit him even better.  Shia LaBeouff is Mutt, a young man who enlists Indy's aid is funny and makes a nice foil for Ford.  Blanchett is probably a little broad with her characterization, but it fits the tone of these movies.  Ray Winstone is Indiana's long-time friend and partner...and he's adequate but the script isn't really all the interested in him either.  John Hurt is fun, and even Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood...and she and Ford have instant and convincing chemistry.    RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was a classic because it melded so well the cheesy action movies of the `40s with modern filmmaking technology and a well-conceived central character.  Subsequent entries in the series are merely extensions or enhancements of the original amazing achievement.  They are loads of fun too (some more than others), but only RAIDERS will ever have classic status.  CRYSTAL SKULL is a worthy partner to the original three films, and I hope you'll set your expectations at the correct level and just go enjoy the heck out of the film!
B0010VD7EO|4.0|This duo formed in CT of all places (now out of Brooklyn, NY) shares with us an even 10 tracks which are quite catchy for garage psych. The duos' vocals can sometimes be a touch unrefined, but other times evoke visions of a long career for their uniqueness. At times they conjure images of Bowie, and others warbling like Prince or Mick Jagger. After all, these guys don't take themselves too seriously. And with Dave Fridmann (Flaming Lips) as their big-name producer, it's easy to see why this spaced out album is shaping up to be a cult hit.<br /><br />Kicking off the album, the pair share the rockstar dream anthem 'Time to Pretend'. The catchiness of this song would make even the most settled suburbanite wish he had forsaken his college career \\"To live fast and die young\\". After all, who hasn't wanted to \\"Move to Paris, shoot some heroin, and fu*k with the stars.\\"?<br /><br />Tracks like '4th Dimensional Transition' echo sentiments of Clap Your Hands Say Yeah in their playful but driving rhythms. The pace changes are sometimes a bit sketchy, but the synth tones mixed with light strings seem a fitting match for the vocals, which range from tenuous to Floyd-esque. Some feel there's an abuse of the falsetto stylings in the vocals, but I don't ever feel they detract from the alternate universe created here by MGMT.<br /><br />Another rocker is 'Of Moons, Birds & Monsters', which exemplifies the duo's willingness to blend pop, psych, and rockabilly into a delicious smoothie that might leave you with a coffee buzz, as it winds down with a thick soundscape<br /><br />Album highlights are the radio friendly 'Time To Pretend' and 'Electric Feel' with its disco influences. Several great tracks for keeping you in a good mood while riding on the bus, or walking along Portland's hip Hawthorne Street. The heavy bass lines will have you bopping your head or strutting to these tracks, which I could also hear in a hipster night club with partiers dancing with vodka and red bulls in hand.<br /><br />I gotta rank this this is 3.5 stars out of 5!<br /><br />-thanks for reading!-3.5 stars out of 5!    -thanks for reading!-

B00011CZRE|4.0|More than a decade old, this film still has appeal because of the artistry of Morgan Freeman and the enduring intrigue of the struggle between good and evil. For each of the Seven Deadly Sins, there is a victim who symbolizes that evil. Traditionally, the seven sins have counterpart virtues that overcome the sin and balance the individual. The killer begins with GLUTTONY and works his way through SLOTH, ENVY, GREED, and PRIDE. The older detective (Freeman) is self-disciplined and holds his anger in check when the killer becomes the symbol of LUST while the younger Man (Pitt) gives in to WRATH.  With this film as many others, the investigators become the targets, and even though the bad guy gets his, he gets in a big blow on the young and inexperienced detective.  This film has too much gratuitous f-word, but the grossness of some of the symbolic individuals seems justified because the murders are a \\"living sermon\\" that the phsychotic killer intends to use to change mankind.  Memorable and thought provoking.
B0010X745K|3.0|It's been said that there are three impossible things to pull off in the world of film making.<br /><br />#1. Get Sean Penn to believably play the leading man in a romantic comedy.<br /><br />#2. Get Kevin Costner the actor to play a role that even slightly differentiates from him being the real life Kevin Costner.<br /><br />#3. Successfully adapt a Stephen King horror film into a movie without completely sabotaging the script (see Kubrick's The Shining).<br /><br />Frank Darabont, while having formerly been able to adapt The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile with great success, and while Meathead (Rob Reiner) managed to do the same with King's The Body (which was adapted into Reiner's Stand By Me), the horror aspect of King's writing has provided many director's with very little success. A quick glance at past failures read likes a Who's Who of pathetic filmography:<br /><br />Cujo (1983)<br />Silver Bullet (1985) - I actually like this one<br />Maximum Overdrive (1986)<br />Needful Things (1993)<br />The Dark Half (1993)<br />Thinner (1996)<br /><br />1990's Misery and the pre 1980 King films notwithstanding, seldom has a director managed to pull of a successful adaptation, especially those King films that had dealt with the supernatural like 1983's The Dead Zone or 1989's Pet Sematary. It's not a knock on King, just a telling fact that his style of writing doesn't always translate well to modern film.<br /><br />Then came The Mist. Darabont sinks his teeth into this one and the result is a very entertaining film that will keep the viewer entrenched for the long run. If ever someone was capable of taking a King book and translating it to the big screen, Frank is the man; however, The Mist at times seems a little too forced and many of the characters simply seem hollow throughout, which contrasted with Darabont's former King films, is a bizarre observation to make considering Shawshank and The Green Mile were heavily inter-laden with character development. Here, however, the story is the main character, and the principle players seem nothing short of h'orderves for an ending that Darabont no doubt put together as the measuring stick for the entire film. I have to say, the ending of this film will stay with you and is as powerful a horror finale as I've ever seen.<br /><br />This ending is the result of a plot that deals with a tiny town in Maine, where perhaps fifty townsfolk, including a father (played by Thomas Jane) and his son, find themselves trapped in a grocery store when an ominous mist rips through town, bringing with it dangerous, unseen creatures that proceed to rip a number of the doubting townsfolk to pieces. It is classic King, and when it's all said and done, Darabont stands to have almost pulled off the impossible, and that is something to be commended.rs seem nothing short of h'orderves for an ending that Darabont no doubt put together as the measuring stick for the entire film.

B0015KO52S|4.0|Jack White and friends are back with another jam-packed album, and it is packed full of jams! Yes barely 2 years after the release of Broken Boy Soldiers they give us fourteen full length tracks with nary a runt in the bunch. Their second album brings back the rock born on BBS and they appear to be more confident, shedding the pop-hooks that made Steady as She Goes such a mainstream hit.<br /><br />While the first two songs could have come right off of a White Stripes album, Songs like `Old Enough' and `Top Yourself' demonstrate how a slide guitars and violins fit into a rock album really exemplifying the groups ability to bring country elements together with White's rock sensibilities in a way that doesn't sound overdone or out of place.<br /><br />While the third cut is a bit slower in pace, you have to get pretty deep into the album for `Many Shades of Black' which is a bit of a crooner. That said, the horns bring in a depth not found on many of the bare-bones tracks by this minimalist quartet. Even a throwback to the Doors phrase \\"Take it as it comes\\" kicks off in the chorus, as the victim of the song pleas to get out of the roller coaster that he's been riding on lamenting that \\"Everybody sees, and everyone agrees, that you and I are wrong, and it's been that way too long.\\"<br /><br />Not a gang to stay blue too long, the very next track is one of the fastest rockers on the album. The song, `Five on the Five', brings a bit more grunge than most of the material found here, and it's followed by another straight out rocker `Attention' which will make you forget that 5 minutes ago you were crying the blues.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great taste of neuvo-vintage rock that seems to find JW steadily in control as usual, but with so many songs, there's plenty of spotlight for the other main man, Brendan Benson to share. I think this album is equally good as their first, which is a major achievement for any band.<br /><br />-thanks for reading!-

B00005JKG9|4.0|Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin, Jack Lemmon star in this hugely memorable film. Oh, and some guy named Al Pacino as well. Glengarry Glen Ross has become the type of film that slowly has sprung forth legend and arguably some of the most memorable lines in movie history, most notably Alec Baldwin's, \\"Put that coffee DOWN! Coffee's for closers!\\"<br /><br />The plot (based on David Mamet's award winning play) deals with a number of real estate salesman and a day at the office that acts as a microcosm of what drives them. With pressure from the higher-ups downtown to close some deals, some will rise to the challenge while others will crumble under its avalanche.<br /><br />Aside from the sub-two hundred f-bombs throughout the film, I enjoyed GGR, and honestly, found the film to suffice all my \\"angst against The Man\\" needs when I saw it a few years ago on TV. Al Pacino shines brightly as his character's lines flow with ferocious splendor throughout the film, with particular emphasis on the last fifteen minutes of the film when he proceeds to needle Ed Harris' character with a systematic verbal bout that made me stand up and applaud with cathartic approval. A very powerful film that will doubtlessly make your day a little more fun for having watched it.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album,  both on a lyrically and instrumentation level,  is my favorite album to date.  Not just Madonna's efforts, but the ENTIRE pop music industry.  This LP has the elements of great pop with sprinklings of rock, country, trip and simply every faction of my mind wraps around this sucker.  I love it,  from the cover to the final tune,  \\"Easy Ride\\".  This LP truly raises the hair on the back of my neck.  Perfect pop once again.  I've loved this one from the first listen, which is unusual.  If you truly listen,  you'll adore this LP as much as I do.  If you've heard it and hate it,  listen again,  with your true ear,  and you'll hear the world.

It reminds me of the catchy, well written Pop music of the Seventies, with a spare clean sound.<br /><br />Lead-off single \\"I'm yours\\" is a nice folky guitar driven song with Ska influences and some skat singing. Opening cut \\"Make it mine\\" is a sunny upbeat song with a great horn section which just makes me feel good.<br /><br />\\"Lucky\\" is another outstanding Beatles-esque guitar ballad and it is a duet with Colbie Caillat. Their voices harmonize so well together. The albums other duet features UK soulful crooner James Morrison; the spare acoustic \\"Details in the fabric\\" with lovely strings. Beautiful!<br /><br />Other standouts are the upbeat and groovy \\"Butterfly\\", the lovely and groovy \\"Coyote\\" (with a nice children's backing choir and some operatic flourishes adding to the drama - my favourite), the soulful/jazzy ballad \\"Only human\\", the disco/funk-tinged \\"The dynamo of volition\\" (with a spitfire vocal delivery, it wouldn't sound out of place on a Jamiroquai CD), the Beatles/Elton John sounding piano ballad \\"If it kills me\\", and the tender soulful closing ballad \\"A beautiful mess\\".<br /><br />This is such a catchy and classy CD. I would heartily recommend it to anyone who appreciates good music.
B000CNESU8|5.0|I saw \\"Network\\" when it was released in 1977.  I'd just graduated from college and was still pretty wet behind the ears.  Now, with thirty years' worth of experience in the world, I've watched the film again, and am stunned by how prescient it is.  Screenplay author Paddy Chayefsky nailed it on both counts when he suggested that the world of television addicts us to artifice, and that money, not nationhood, is the new basic international unit.  Incredible that he could've predicted all this a full generation ago.<br /><br />As a culture brought up on television and films, we're more comfortable with virtual reality than with reality.  We want TV shows with formulaic plots (parodied in \\"Network\\" by a hilarious meeting of producers in which every pitch for a new show has a similar \\"crusty but benign\\" character).  We want titillation, outrageousness, and splendor more than truth (think about today's talk shows).  And even when given a dose of reality on the screen (today's misnamed \\"reality shows\\" come immediately to mind), we want it directed, choreographed, and offered in a convenient timeslot.  This is precisely the kind of entertainment that poor Howard Beale (brilliantly played by Peter Finch) offers, and that the network predators want to cash in on.  Bread and circuses:  that's what the people want, that's what the network gives 'em.<br /><br />Corporate chief Arthur Jensen's (played equally brilliantly by Ned Beatty) \\"corporate cosmology\\" soliloquy toward the end of the movie perfectly captures the dark side of globalization, the film's second major theme.  \\"The world is a business!\\" thunders Jensen.  The only important international players are the huge multinationals, not national governments.  The entire social structure of the planet has shifted, propelling us into an entirely new world.  And the media, increasingly bought up by the multinationals, become more homogeneous in their programming, news becomes infomercial, and corporate cosmology becomes a reality.<br /><br />It's as if Chayefsky wrote \\"Network\\" while gazing at a crystal ball.<br /><br />The film's not perfect.  Chayefsky crams too much into the plot and so their are some loose ends (the death of Edward George Ruddy, for example, seems comes across as rather contrived), and Faye Dunaway tends to overact (although she won an Academy Award for her performance).  But all in all, \\"Network\\" truly is one of the greatest American films ever made.if Chayefsky wrote \\"Network\\" while gazing at a crystal ball.    The film's not perfect.

078324228X|5.0|Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter had been a nonstop hurricane in the racist world of white police, disrupting the white police for more than 20 years. The Hurricane, directed by Norman Jewison in 1999, was a well made docudrama that was based on Carter's autobiography, 'The 16th Round', which was published in 1974. It was also based upon a book, 'Lazarus and the Hurricane', written by Chaiton and Swinton's, Carter's Canadian friends, published in 1991. This film, or a docudrama, tells the story of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, an African-American middle-weight boxer. Rubin Carter spent quite a troubled youth, mostly in prison, but he made it through to become a champion. However, Rubin Carter was accused of a murder, in 1966, and was convicted to three life prison terms. He tried very hard to prove his innocence, but his efforts were no good for 19 years. In November 8, 1985, Rubin Carter had another trial and finally won with the help of an African American boy and his Canadian friends, who read the autobiography written by Carter.       The moive, Hurricane, is a successful Hollywood film. The different scenes of the movies combine together and tells a great story of an unfortunate black boxer. However, the movie does not do a good job on accurately conveying the truth of the Rubin Carter case. It misses some important information of the case and it does not present other cases, which might have connections with the Rubin Carter case, that has also involved racism.       The movie is very well made. Rubin Carter is played by Denzel Washington, and he delivers Carter to the audience in a way that helps the audience to feel the character. This is shown especially in a scene where Carter is put in a cell for 90 days after he gets arrested as a 1966 murder. Denzel Washington performs Carter in three different moods, including anger, fear, and hopelessness. The movie itself is hightly praiseworthy with actors' realistic and excellent acting.       The movie goes back and forth in time. The very first scene is about boxing championship tournament that happened in 1963. Then it shows the scene in Trenton State Prison in 1973 with Carter being mad at the news of the police's search of his cell without particular reasons. The scene changes between these two events twice and then comes the key incident of the movie, which is the murder at the Lafayette Bar and Grill in Paterson, New Jersey. This raises the audience an interest of what happens to the main character, since it requires the audience to see the whole movie to get a sense of what the beginning scenes are all about.       The movie does not show all of Carter's early lives through himself but through another person named Lesra, an African American boy studying in Canada. Lesra reads Carter's autobiography and decides to meet Carter in prison. Carter's early life, including the reason why he goes to the Jamesburg State Home for Boys as a 12 year-old boy, his love life, and his life as a boxer, is shown as flashbacks with Denzel Washington's narrations. This is a time saving technique, because two different stories are told at the same time, the story of Carter and Lesra. It also shows the difference between Lesra and Rubin effectively; Rubin's life is full of hardships and troubles, but Lesra has a gifted life as an African American in Canada.       The movie does not have enough information of Rubin Carter case. The name, Leroy Holloway, is never mentioned in the movie, but he is considered as a person to be deeply related to the case. He was an African American owner of the Waltz Inn in Paterson. He was murdered by a white man, who had sold the Walztz Inn to Holloway, came to Holloway and murdered him because Holloway had been behind his payments. This incident only happened eight hours before the murder at 2:30 a.m. that Rubin Carter was wrongly accused of. The police assumed that it was hightly possible that the black men might had committed the second murder for the revenge.The movie does not show the whilte police's clear reasons for Carter's arrest, but rather shows the police's act as racist. In actual history, the police had enough evidence to support their arrest of Rubin. They not only faked some of the testimony, but also found some weapons, which looked similar to the actual weapons that were used in the murder, in Rubin's car.       Although the film is not perfect as a docudrama, it is a successful Hollywood movie. The movie uses the historical facts well enough to let the audience not being aware of the incident's historical accuracy. All the scenes and the acting blend very well to produce a one great piece of art. The Hurricane could have been a great docudrama, but its failure as a docudrama makes it a praiseworthy film.

B000002UVX|3.0|Growing up, I loved Jimi Hendrix's Experience.  I had never tried his Band of Gypsies vinyl back in the day.  I bought this on sale to add to the Hendrix collection and I'm not sure if it will stay.  This album is the first after his breakup with them and it's a live recording from 1969.      Some say it's the beginning of the end,  I cannot say that.  It's good, solid blues, but I prefer hearing Hendrix rocking.     This is a six song collection, that is almost 46 minutes long.  You get a lot of live jamming on this CD, which is mostly worth hearing.  Vocals on \\"Who Knows\\" just annoy me; however, \\"Machine Gun\\" is excellent--good strong playing and one of my favorites of all his work.      I don't regret hearing this CD, but I think I'd rather remember Jimi rocking with the Experience than bluesing with the Gypsies.       Rebecca Kyle, May 2008

B0012K1ILW|5.0|For those who have written that they didnt understand Erykah on this album, need to really sit and rethink thier position. This album is a classic, just like the others she has put out. She is the true epitome of an artist. What first got you onto listening to Erykah Badu? More than likely it was because she brought a breath of fresh air, and creativity to a music industry that had lost its way.      So when Baduizm first dropped, you heard the songs on there and said, \\"Wow, this is different, and I like this\\" So what is the problem now?    \\"Me\\" This song is deep. Remember Erykah Badu has now been aquainted with the teachings of the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad as taught by the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan. So this song reflects alot of that. The fact she said that she was born on Saviours Day (which is a convention of the Nation of Islam celebrating the birth of Master Fard Muhammad), then she even calls out to our leader, teacher and Guide by name, Min. Louis Farrakhan. It dont get no better than that    \\"Soldier\\" This song is raising Black conscience again. Revolution, she says \\"baptized when the levy broke\\" then she again makes reference to the \\"Bow ties and the Final Calls, and if you thinking bout turnin back, I got the shotgun on your back\\" Like Harriet Tubman who would make the slaves go on to freedom.    \\"Master Teacher\\" Nation time to the fullest. What if there were no niggas only Master Teachers? DEEP. The Master Teacher came in July 1930 and taught one who was among us face to face for 3 years. This is what we all strive to become, teachers, part of the 5%.    Hump this is a song to all those who are dealing with substance abuse. She wrote it from thier perspective. Then what was so clean about it is that she broke it down with a Switch interpolation right in the middle    Telephone was a RIP track, remembering some of those who passed away, and HONEY is the cut, self explanatory.

B000YAA68C|3.0|I bought this for my wife for mother's day. She saw it in the theater and really loved it. So, I sat down to watch it with her and was passed out cold on the couch within 5 minutes. I woke up refreshed as the end credits were rolling. That's the only way to enjoy a sappy chick flick! Guys, I highly reccomend it if you're tired.
067003830X|5.0|Norman Doidge , zelf psychoanalist, psychiater, onderzoeker, schrijver en dichter beschrijft in The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science de laatste inzichten uit de school van neuro or brain plasticity . Met deterministische en Darwinistische inzichten over de hard wired aard van onze hersenen wordt afgerekend met veel praktijkvoorbeelden, gekoppeld aan spraakmakende onderzoeken. De jarenlang gepropageerde paradigma's rondom de stricte indeling van de hersenen in gebieden die vastomlijnde taken (gehoor, spraak, visueel geheugen, motoriek, plezier, etc.) uitvoeren of 'waarnemen', blijken niet langer houdbaar. Het boek brengt je bij vrouwen met verstoorde evenwichtsorganen, kwieke senioren, een schaakspelede Nathan Sharansky in Russische gevangenissen, sexuele aantrekkingskracht en liefde. Uitgebreid staat Doidge stil bij hoe een pornografische verslaving echt werkt, en waarom cold turkey afkicken daarvan helpt. Mensen die na uitvalsverschijnselen, hersenbloedingen of verlammingen weer leren spreken en bewegen. Wonderen, verricht door de neuronen, zenuwbanen en elektrische circuits in ons lichaam en voornamelijk hersenen, daarbij geholpen door bijzondere therapieën met spiegels, alternatieve toediening van elektrische pulsen. Het blijkt mogelijk zorgen, obsessies, dwangmatige handelingen en slechte gewoonten te verminderen of geheel opzij te zetten zonder magie of repressie.<br /><br />Pijn, ons voorstellingsvermogen, maar ook leervermogen en een bijzondere vrouw die opgroeide met slechts haar rechterhersenhelft. Twee appendices beschrijven de wederkerigheid tussen cultuur en hersenen en plasticiteit versus de vooruitgangsleer. The Brain that Changes itself heeft terecht veel lovende kritieken gekregen en nodigt uit tot hernieuwd lezen.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill Vol. 1 sets the bar for the genre of violent, action films. Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, David Carradine and others did a spectacular job in their roles. And a special appearance by 1960's J-Pop band the 5678's was really part of the films best moments. Quentin Tarantino should have won an Oscar for best director for Kill Bill Vol 1. I love it and I am look forward to buying Vol. 2.
0307265730|5.0|(Note: I'm not Indian but have had plenty of Indian students, colleagues,  and friends.)  Interpreter of Maladies was probably the best short story collection I  have ever read.  With The Namesake, Lahiri tried the novel form and  it just didn't fit her.  Now she has found the perfect form for her.  I'd call these \\"short stories\\" because of the format but they have  the length of a (short) novella.  This allows them to be meatier,  and yet she retains that wonderful sense of detail which makes her  such a joy to read.  Again it is the quintessential American story,  the first and (more often) second generation Americans balancing (in her  case) Indian roots and American styles.  Again it is the successful  parents worrying (with or without cause) about their Americanized  children.  For the first time there is a story (about a young  woman named Sang, but I won't give it away) that was in parts  very amusing.  Lahiri is a treasure -- and she's back!
B000002HJR|5.0|One of the best albums I own. Maybe THE BEST! An essential lesson in Doom/Stoner metal. Sounds like it was influenced by Ozzy-era Black Sabbath and Trouble. The sum of the parts (Pepper Keenan, Phil Anselmo) is greater than their previous bands (C.O.C, Pantera). Super Heavy, but bluesy and melodic. Even the lighter songs (Stone the Crow) are heavy, and the other trippy stuff (Jail) is great too. Will not dissapoint.
B000VAQX0A|5.0|Preordered this CD the minute I possibly could, and was not disappointed! I have all the other MoFi Rush CD's as well and another awesome product. Geddy's bass sounds more lifelike and that Ricky sound really comes through. Alex's guitars sound more spacious and up front, Neil's percussion is cleaner with a wider soundstage. Geddy's vocals also sound like he's in the room with you, the most lifelike I have ever heard. I would love it if MoFi also remastered Caress of Steel and A Farewell to Kings.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|If you're a Michael Jackson fan, you probably have at least two or more greatest hits compilations, but this one is truly a must have.  Packed with all the amazing hits including many from the Jackson 5 and Jacksons era, also delivering a good number of previously unreleased tracks and original demos that any fan would more than appreciate (The demo from 'We Are the World' it's impossible to find and simply brilliant).    The booklet itself is amazing, superb pictures and lots of info. Plus the Bucharest concert, if you don't have it already then here it is.   Just LOVE IT.
140120306X|3.0|I have read it and re - read it, and I think it's good, really, and Moore put a great effort to make his world even richer of allusions, quotations and homages to the mid twentieth century literature, with a great framework taken from a \\"post - Orwellian\\" society. the prose experiment is also good even if it has some part well constructed and other a bit repetitive. so if you love Moore works and the League, you've read Nevins commentary and you are amused by the game of quotations, puns and allusions hidden in the text, buy it, it's probably written precisely for you, but if you won't, it's not half as good as the other league volumes and the author tends to be a little too much enthralled by his own creation and in some points the \\"Black dossier\\" is a bit self referential.
B0012GVKW8|5.0|It's great on my 1080p.... but it's old pictures but overall its bit better than you seen on DVD.
B00154GEFU|1.0|I am a HUGE Asia fan, ever since the first album.  I've followed these guys through the years, seen many of their concerts (even the Alpha tour in Rochester NY in 1983, just before the tour cancelled).    But I have to say this album is a major disappointment, as I suspected it would be.  Ther are about 3 songs too many (throw away songs) on this CD.  The only tune I really like is \\"Wish I'd Known\\" ... great tune!  But the rest is dribble.    Gone is that big Asia sound.  No muscle in this album.  Too refined.  Digital sucks, analog rules.  I really miss that heavy synth sound of the 80's and of Asia.    I still love this band, but this project is disappointing.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|1080p HDTV with my PS3 playing this movie is so freaking awesome!  Looking way better than the VHS and DVD with the standard TV.
B0016B6ZKG|2.0|After Donna Summer making numerous claims over the years that she was working on a new album (as far as back 1994), it's finally happened ... and so this is what we've been waiting for 17 years? Of course you can't expect Donna to make another \\"Once Upon a Time\\" or \\"Bad Girls\\" but \\"Crayons\\" is simply so focussed on being hip, versatile and trendy that the strong melodies that Summer has always been a guarantee for have gone down the drain. Neither does her fantastic voice (which is still as strong and vibrant as ever) get a chance to shine. I wonder whatever happened to excellent new tracks like \\"Valley Of The Moon\\", \\"Adonai\\" and others that were featured on her website last year. I'd much rather have had an album with tunes like \\"I Got Your Love\\" and \\"You're So Beautiful\\".    I have now listened to \\"Crayons\\" several times and I'm still unable to recall many of the tunes except for \\"I'm a Fire\\" which I do like a lot and the single \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" which is catchy but not a sensational single by any means. The album cover artwork looks amazing but overall it grieves me deeply to report that \\"Crayons\\" is even more overblown, erratic and soulless than my least favourite DS album \\"Donna Summer\\" (1982). What a disappointment.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|My grandmother is a Tom Selleck fan and now she's a big Stone Cold fan too.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Read my review on the second season...i forgot to tell that the quality of the picture/sound and the packaging of the set is excellent, and many shows/dvds for sets ad more value.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I was channel surfing a few years ago when I stumbled across Austin City Limits, featuring some unknown (to me) singing and playing the guitar. I was instantly hooked. Who is this Jason Mraz, I wondered? Never heard of him. How could I never have heard of someone this good?? I watched the rest of the show, spellbound, and went out and bought Mr A-Z immediately. I was just blown away: such clever, self-aware, intelligent lyrics! catchy melodies! a pure and beautiful voice!  Everyone I played it for fell in love with it instantly.    Fast forward to today.    When I looked at the cover of \\"We Sing...\\", I thought, what kind of a title is that, \\"... We Steal Things?\\" Is that a message, like \\"Steal This Book?\\" I knew absolutely nothing about the CD or the songs on it. Surely it could not be as good as Mr A-Z? Then I listened to it. After the third song (Lucky), I was awed to realized that he was \\"stealing\\" patterns - of brilliant songs - and molding them into equally brilliant but fresh songs. The extremely (and deservedly) popular \\"I'm Yours\\" reminds me a little of Bob Marley's \\"One Love\\". Other songs on the CD also bring to mind music I have heard before, but I'm not quite sure what and where. The CD seems to distill the \\"special sauce\\" inherent in great songs into something that is both new and strangely familiar. Tributes and the like have been done before, but rarely as well as this.    To me, the best singer-songwriters are poets that set their words to music. Jason Mraz is most certainly a poet, a great singer, and a marvelous songwriter. His music has been called \\"radio-friendly pop\\" but it's much more than that - it's truly exceptional. I really, really hope that he receives the recognition that he deserves.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I bought the first season on sale long ago, only cause it was a great price...I always like Cold Case, Without a Trace kind of shows, as well as comedy and a bit of drama...I regreted buying VERONICA MARS cause I thought it was just another teens boring drama...one day I play it cause I didnt have anything else to watch...OMG!!! I watched the whole first season at once, I couldnt stop, every episode is so good, and the end is so unexpected and thrilling...I couldnt wait get my second and third season on the mail, although, I thought the might not been able to match such a great first season...I WAS WRONG AGAIN!!! It just got better...I don't understand why they stopped after the third season, maybe because they gave it all on these 3 seasons...I have recomend Veronica Mars to everybody i know, from teens to grand parents, very enjoyable.
032147404X|5.0|This is one the best books I've ever read on Photography. Scott cuts through the crap and give the reader clear easily understood directions on how to take great photos with a digital camera. Once I've mastered what's in book I, I'll certainly move on to book II.
B000E1MTZE|4.0|I must be the only adult that didnt watch this movie when they first came out...now it might have lost the novelty cause many other movies follow the same tricks...I didnt enjoyed much as i think I would have back when first released...great to have it in HD.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|There are some catchy tunes on this enjoyable album. It really is pop music with a bite to it. Check out A-Punk..hey, hey, hey...or M-79. This is a fun album.
B000GTLQXU|4.0|Can't top the original, they try to improve but loss some of the best original scenes...like Shelley Winters great part almost at the end of the movie.
0312360266|2.0|I couldn't believe this was written for teenagers. Oral Sex and so much fowl language. I know sailors who don't cuss as much as was in this book. It was ridiculous. I have to say the story did keep me rivited, but it was too hard to get through the sex and the language. Just Awful. I won't recommend it to anyone I know.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|My nephew like it, but didnt drive him crazy as the original made so many years ago
0399213015|4.0|It's a book full of fun. But the size might be too small for a little baby.
B000Q6GXW2|3.0|I guess it was so heavily promoted that I expected more...I dont think is worth to have it on HD, the picture and colors in general doesnt look so natural,  probably because all the computer FXs used on the movie.
B0015FHDRW|5.0|Yep it's easy to hear it's Green day. I love it but being an old dude I love garage rock.  Some hardcore younger folks might not get into this pseudo Green Day effort.  For me and this is a cliche...I  dig it the most.<br />The Alligator tune is my fav.  If you kind of like Green Day and garage rock, I say buy it.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|A must have on your collection, great to share at home with friends/familly, great for a gift....read my review on the second season.
B000WS4QJG|2.0|Someone once told me this is the biggest selling album ever.<br /><br />The sequencing is pretty screwy.  The song \\"Thriller\\" should have ended side 2.<br /><br />I believe Billie Jean's side of the story.<br /><br />Why didn't they include \\"Stranger in Moscow\\"?
B0015519VS|2.0|This long awaited project missed the mark.  What were you thinking? Here I Stand clearly caters to this arbitrary \\"older\\" fan base that you don't have.  This CD lacks the hip-hop funkiness and familiarity enojyed with the  \\"Confessions\\" CD.   Except for the potential of \\"Moving Mountains\\" I don't get this at all.  Not a fan...sorry!
B000002UAI|5.0|First, the album cover itself is probably my favorite image of the Beatles.  Very impressionistic, it reveals the first concentrated inkling of maturity.  Image-wise, it's as big a leap from the A HARD DAY'S NIGHT album cover as the WHITE ALBUM'S \\"blankness\\" was from the density of the more iconic SGT. PEPPER cover.<br /><br />This is important, given the image-consciousness of the Beatles.  They really were making a definitive statement of what it meant to be a Beatle, a year or so into full-blown Beatlemania.  It was their first declarative turn away from the youthful vigor of their first mass-marketed image.  Pretty daring.<br /><br />The originally-penned songs on the album sonically express the exhaustion and disillusionment displayed visually.  Both Lennon's and McCartney's songs are profoundly confessional, in a way I think that matches the similar subjects and sensibilities of RUBBER SOUL a year later.  One of the major revelations regarding the depth of the Beatles I've ever had was when I discovered just how dark an album RUBBER SOUL truly is (nearly every song is pessimistic about romance and relationships), while the second great revelation was to discover just how dark BEATLES FOR SALE is.  Critics tend to position the Beatles as naive idealists (especially McCartney...get over it..wrong!), but these two albums reveal otherwise (okay, \\"Eight Days A Week\\" is relatively cheery).<br /><br />Perhaps the one minor drawback is the reliance on cover versions, of which there are several.  Nothing wrong with them, but the original tunes would make for an exceptional 9-song EP on their own (if EPs could run that long).  Is \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" a joke?  I've been listening for 30 years, and I still can't tell, which is at least partially what makes it so interesting.<br /><br />Best song?  \\"I'll Follow the Sun.\\"  Second best?  \\"No Reply.\\"
B000WCBPOG|5.0|this product arrived in perfect time and the songs are wonderful!  I love the movie and wanted to have the cd!
B000001ELR|5.0|My first taste of KISS music was in the late 70s with the release of Double Platinum. They made such a clear impression at the time that I remember it today as though I were a kid again. My musical interests changed and KISS became more a part of my listening past than it did its present, but that all changed upon hearing this album. This album is in fact a defining moment as a KISS fan, and drummer in particular. In my humble opinion, this is KISS best album. The production has a somewhat dark and ominous quality while be perfectly suited to the music, and Eric Carr is superb. Not before or since has a drummer excelled within this style of music. Perfect form, terrific function and in short, the very best rock drummer to entertain my ears. Safe to say, Mr. Carr became a musical influence almost immediately. This is an album that grabs you immediately. A pure example of cutting-to-the-chase... From the double-bass introduction of the title track, to the faded guitar/vibrato of the closing track War Machine. This album made it clear and evident to me that KISS was in fact a force to be reckoned within the time and moment. Sadly, rock music would become somewhat of a shadow, making this album just that much more of a pleasure. This album does KISS and its fans proud. Just as it does the meaning of rock music at its finest level.
0345501292|5.0|I am a huge fan of the \\"Indiana Jones\\" series, even though I was slightly disappointed with the most recent film.  However, this `coffee-table' style book is a classic keeper!  Authors J. W. Rinzler and Laurent Bouzereau piece together all the information any fan could want.  From the inception where George Lucas and Steven Spielberg first start the process to the final sequel, there's a ton of information here.  It's almost comical the way the storyboards are so carefully and accurately drawn and then filmed.  The chronicling of the initial three films is a lesson in production where you get the inside scoop from Spielberg, Lucas and the cast and crew, especially the last (\\"Crystal Skull\\") film.  I particularly liked the section on \\"deleted scenes\\" as some seemed like a good idea and others were just plain silly.  This book would make a great present as well.
B000002KHH|4.0|This is classic Black Sabbath right here.  It doesn't get any better than this.  While the mini jam-sessions get a little overplayed, the songs are great from beginning to end.  This album contains all the classics such as the title track, \\"War Pigs\\", and \\"Iron Man.\\"  If you like Ozzy & Black Sabbath, definitely get this.
B000NA28I4|4.0|The young boy comes of age while learning to fly his own dragon.<br />Sometimes foolish and sometimes over brave, he helps the resistance<br />defeat the kings army. He just barely saves both his girl and his dragon...<br />He is a healthy, handsome blond kid and the king and his evil magician are<br />are as usually just plain bad to worse in black and pale white faces.<br />I like it, but the dragon special effects are really too good here.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This is probably one of the best albums of the 70's.  Every song is good; particularly \\"More Than a Feeling\\" and \\"Foreplay/Long Time.\\"  If you don't own this album, you need to pick it up.
0575081384|3.0|A richly imagined story.  Patrick Rothfuss takes little in conventional fantasy for granted, and this first novel in the \\"Kingkiller\\" series reflects that.  If you're looking for a fantastical world so realistic and thoroughly designed that you'll even understand its currency system in full by the time you're done reading, this is it.    I would like to have seen all of the characters as richly imagined.  A few of their actions are difficult to understand (though necessary for advancing the plot).  These incongruities were sometimes jarring.    I wonder if this novel faces the same challenge Frank McCourt's _Angela's Ashes_ did:  the story, in telling, becomes longer than the author expected, causing the book to end at a point in the narrative not originally planned.  I felt that the end was missing an element or two, which may have been due to the foreshadowing at the beginning of the story that wasn't fulfilled within the book.  Yes, this is the first volume of a trilogy -- there should still be balance within the book itself.    However, Rothfuss's storytelling style is fascinating enough that I'll look for more of his work.  This was an enjoyable book.
B00005JPTI|1.0|I read Matheson's book prior to seeing the movie.  Watching the movie, I felt like \\"what story am I watching here?!\\"  The ending, the girl's role, the whole thing was changed. There was a tiny bit of the essence of Matheson's book, but the stunning quality of I AM LEGEND is it's ending.  Why is he legend. Will Smith was awesome and he carried me through the movie. But what a disappointment overall.
B000002KHH|5.0|It was on Friday the 13th of February 1970 when Sabbath unleashed the beast known as metal with their debut. Seven months later, Tony, Ozzy, Bill and Geezer defined and perfected the genre with this record. No metal or hard rock music collection would be complete without this masterpiece. All hail the almighty Sabbath!
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This unique comedy seems like it has to have been written by a bunch of Buddhists (a friend told me it was, it seems believable to me, but I haven't actually verified that).

0060899190|5.0|I found this book fantastic on a number of different levels.  First, it was artistic...people sending in postcards that were original and/or altered to fit their mood.  Second, it was truth...or at least something close to it.  People sharing their deepest secrets, expunging their soul and saying what they really think.  The collection goes from high drama to low comedy from page to page, and kept me enthralled from dust jacket to dust jacket.
B00005JMJG|5.0|is that this is my favorite movie of all time. It has a significant meaning to me. Its a good movie to watch if your just out of a long relationship. Jim carrey is great. He is far more than just a good comic actor. He is a great overall actor period. His dramatic performances are pretty over looked. he did great in this movie. I recommend this to pretty much everyone. its a movie you will want to watch more than once so you catch more of whats going on.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought the Planet Earth, set of 5 DVD's for myself and my grandson, who is 4, but loves nature and animal life DVD's as much as I do.  Each DVD held our interest to the end and not only was it very educational, but the scenery shots were magnificent.  I felt that I got this set at a really good price, compared to Best Buy, etc. and the set came in perfect order and within a week of my placing the order.  I would recommend this set to anyone.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|THEE BEST!! AMAZON is SO GREAT in service, price, communication...EVERYTHING!! I ordered this DVD for my daughter and Grandson and they are SOOOOOOOO HAPPY!! FAST SHIPMENT...PERFECT in EVERY way!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, AMAZON!!!
B0013FXWU6|2.0|There Will Be Blood in a nutshell; he worked hard, he cheated people, he was as mean as a cobra and enjoyed killing people. Make no mistake, Daniel Day Lewis renders a tour-de-force performance; unfortunately, unless you're a Texas wildcatter, this movie will come across as a bit too slow and maybe a tad too long.
B0015AARJI|5.0|this was for a playstatation3 wireless controller. I find it works well with fine. It is a great prodruct for the plystation 3.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|When I first heard the song \\"Apologize\\" I was watching the video on VH1.  This might sound a bit crazy, but while I was listening to Ryan Tedder's beautiful and highly expressive voice, I also noticed that he had the most perfect teeth. (don't you all laugh at me.)  \\"Apologize\\" is a wonderful song, but there are a few other songs on the CD that I enjoy more: \\"Say (All I Need), \\"Stop and Stare,\\" \\"All Fall Down,\\" and \\"Come Home.\\"  Actually, I think the entire CD is well worth the listen, and I have listened to it many many times.  A few of the songs remind me of Coldplay, but the difference is that I think Tedder has a better voice than Chris Martin.  I would suggest that anyone that likes bands like, Coldplay, Travis, Keane, and even R.E.M., will probably find great pleasure in listening to One Republic and their debut CD \\"Dreaming Out Loud.\\"  Buy it.
1401216676|3.0|First off I love the stroy it just seems like it was lacking something. I dont like it when a story makes me feel that way because then there is almost no reason in reading again. That is just my personal view. I appreciate the joker being brutal but like I said, there was something missing. I guess I had certain expectations seeing as so many people swear by this story. It was good it isnt great. Plus, when I get my books, I want them to be in awesome condition. There are many little flaws on the slip cover and on the actual hard cover, there are pencile marks!!! Pencile marks!! What, did thet use it as a clip board before they shipped it??? WTF?!?! I dont live with mommy and daddy and I work for my money so when you say its new thats how I expect to get it. When I bought this book I also purchaced the Weapon X story arch and that book to was damaged when I was told that it was new. I dont know just not a good experience in general.... :(
B00006DEFA|5.0|Having always liked the movie Amadeus...I foung the directors cut to be better than the theater version. There is about 20 minutes of additional footage that explains a bit more of the movie.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|As a longtime Pearl Jam fan, these guys never fail to disappoint me. Eddie Vedder's vocal range is simply breathtaking, and Mike McCready and Stone Gossard are among the best lead guitar-rhythm guitar duos in the history of rock.    But 2006's self-titled release is simply amazing. Whether you bought it because of the radio hit 'Life Wasted' or because you're a huge Pearl Jam fan, it doesn't matter.     This is, by a long shot, their best since 'Vitalogy.' 'Army Reserve,' 'Life Wasted,' 'Comatose,' 'World Wide Suicide' and even the 'Wasted Reprise' are among Pearl Jam's best songs, as well as the soft (for Pearl Jam) rocker 'Gone.'    I have always enjoyed Pearl Jam. And this record is just amazing. And having seen them in concert, they are among the bset live acts I've ever seen. Vedder is quite the showman and quite the entertainer, as this one and 'Live At the Gorge 05/06' both document.    Overall, this is highly recommended for any Pearl Jam fan. It's one of their finest releases to date. You would have to be crazy to not love Pearl Jam.    Highly recommended. A classic record from PJ. ENJOY!!!
B000VXLC3K|4.0|If you were alive in 1970-71 what's to say? It's classic Carole King at her finest!!!!! BUY IT!!!
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin's second record 'Led Zeppelin II' was released in 1969, just a few months after their debut 'Led Zeppelin I' came out. The record was apparently written and recorded in just three days. Most bands need up to six months to write a record full of decent material.    But not Zeppelin. Three days was all it took. Songs like 'Whole Lotta Love,' 'Heartbreaker,' and even 'What Is And Should Never Be' are classic rock radio staples.    And, in 1994, Atlantic digitally remastered this. The sound quality is superb!    If you are a fan of the blues, listen in for songs like 'The Lemon Song' and 'Bring It On Home.' Those songs were heavily influenced by Delta Blues. Plant's vocals are mighty fine.    Overall, this remains my all-time favorite Zeppelin record. They are all great, but this one really stands out, in my opinion.    Highly recommended for any Zep fan. A classic masterpiece. ENJOY!!!
B000001FS6|5.0|This album is one of their best. A great LIVE cut for this band. Bono's passion for what he sings ignites the audience. The Edge and the rest of the band putting forth extraordinary energy in every note. Buy this and enjoy it for years.
B00007KWI9|5.0|Take yourself back to 1967 in a nightclub in London. Jon Anderson is an employee when he meets Chris Squire, a customer at this nightclub. The two begin talking, and within the next day, they both begin to make music.    While Squire was already a member of the short-lived '60s group The Syn at the time, he carved out time to work with Anderson. The project eventually became known as Yes. The group eventually came to add The Syn's guitarist, Peter Banks and Bill Bruford, who posted an advertisement in the musical newspaper 'Melody Maker' looking for work.    The group also added Tony Kaye. And the band got their big break in 1968 when Cream could not make their farewell concert in London. At the last minute, Yes was called upon to replace Cream.    And the rest is history. Yes was signed to Atlantic later that year, and in 1969 turned out a great debut album. Songs like 'Beyond And Before' and 'Survival' became instant fan favorites, while their covers of songs like The Beatles' 'Every Little Thing' and The Byrds' 'I See You' also became fan favorites eventually.    Of course, this is just a small piece of the puzzle for Yes. They would produce numerous masterpieces during the 1970s. The group cut one other album with this lineup, 'Time And A Word,' which featured a 30-piece orchestra. Banks was fired within days of that albums release in 1970.    Overall, this is highly recommended for any Yes fan who wants to hear what their sound was like in the beginning. It is a classic album from a legendary band.    Highly recommended. An underrated classic.     ENJOY!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I guess I'm one of the fans that helped make this show a cult hit after the fact, because I had never even heard of it while it was after on the air.  I was a sci-fi fan and was referred to it by a friend, and I found myself mourning the cancellation of the show years after the fact.  The only complaint I have of the show is that it was not given sufficient time to fully flesh out off of it's intricacies, and so the studio wasted great potential when it was cut loose.  Make sure to check out Serenity as well, because it at least brings some degree of closure, but I still would have preferred a few seasons between the end of this show and the movie finale.
0887307280|5.0|I read this book from the perspective of one has not only pastored in the church for 40 years, but also as one who has consulted with numerous leaders about their churches.  The insights from small business easily carry over into the business of establishing a church community.  It's not about money, it's about really understanding what you're all about, building a system to make it happen in the best possible way, and maintaining your joy in doing what you really love to do.  I am passionate about urging other church leaders to read this book.  It's a gem!
B0013UN9DQ|5.0|As I write this, I am listening to the original LP on Source, made in france. I bought it used shortly after it came out, it was a little scratched, but the vibe that immediately came through on \\"La Femme D'Argent\\" blew me away. Totally captivated I played it at least twice before letting the LP go through. In fact Side A (first four tracks) is a musical masterpiece that effortlessly captures the best elements of funk, electronic-downtempo, avant-garde and pop! This was an instant classic that has not diminished, only grown stronger with the passage of time. BTW G.O.A.T. stands for \\"Greatest Of All Time\\".

0452289963|4.0|The book is definately worth the read if you are seeking a different point of view of your life. It makes you think in a new way. The author guides you towards changing your focus from seeing the world through yourself to seeing it through God's eyes. This book is good but a little out there. It takes concentration and rereading to grasp some of the ideas. It has made an impact on me and I will be reading it again.
B00133KHCY|4.0|[[ASIN:B00133KHCY August Rush [Blu-ray]]]  The blu-ray version of August Rush is definitely worth the investment especially if you have a good sound system. The high definition sound track is crisp, clear and adds another dimension to the film. I thought the dvd was excellent but the blu-ray is so much better. Highly recommended, even essential to your collection.
B00138CYD4|1.0|YUK!  I just recently started downloading mp3s and really screwed up when I bought this thinking it would be the Carlos Santana music I knew in the 60s.  What else would \\"Ulitmate Santana\\" mean?  Instead most of the album is just Santana accompanying some bozo singing stupid disco type songs.  My bad.  Remember, when it says \\"featuring so-and-so\\" it usually means you better like so-and-so and not care too much about who the titled performer is.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|Thankfully Harrison Ford's age had nothing to do with it. He's just fine. In 19 years we've all become more jaded & a lot harder to impress with obvious but great special effects. Even so I recommend seeing this on the big screen because those special effects are that good. However, seeking out crystal skulls that may or may not have existed are not as compelling as the Ark of the Covenant & the Holy Grail. As we have changed so has Indy. He is no longer a treasure hunter plundering other countries antiquities, for $$$ & his favorite museum's glory. He is seeking to return a crystal skull, gain knowledge & prevent the greedy commies from getting it. Bringing back his old girlfriend, Marion, was a really nice touch. In a minor plot she also had a son that is Indy's. He becomes Indy's sidekick & you could see that coming a mile off. Cate Blanchett is somewhat miscast vamping it up as a Garboesque villian. That had to be done deliberately. A great summer movie & it should win the season unless the ladies rally around the ultimate chick flick, Sex & the City.
0061122416|5.0|This book has had an amazing impact on my life.  I'm at a place where I'm searching for my purpose in life (Personal Legend if you will :)) and I have been reading self-help book after self-help book.  I love The Secret, was even on Oprah for the follow up show.  What makes this book so refreshing is the story.  It takes you away from the typical self-help-how-to book and speaks in this beautiful story.  I read the whole book in 4 hours!    Paulo is a brilliant author and I am currently reading his first book The Pilgrimage & By The River Piedra I Sat Down And Wept.    Happy Reading everyone ;)
B0015FHDRW|5.0|I have listened to this album over and over and can't give it past four stars.  There is something about the music that I love and can't get away from, but its also missing something.  I just listened to Rikki Rockett's new album called \\"Glitter 4 Your Soul\\" and I think it has all the elements that this CD has plus a little more which is way it is the first album I have rated a 5 in over a year.  It is definately a must hear for anyone who is wanting perfection.
B0013527I4|5.0|his set marks the third of five seasons that will hopefully all come to DVD soon. After watching the first three seasons, it only serves to remind me how great this show was and how today's families are fortunate for the opportunity to see this kind of quality and creativity today.<br /><br />Genius is a word commonly attributed to Jim Henson, as well as some of his longtime collaborators, such as Frank Oz and Jerry Nelson, but the show itself is an ingenious concoction as well. Under the guise of constant self-deprecation, it is actually a meticulously crafted blend of vaudeville, TV variety and satire that constantly reflects within itself with a sharp irony much like that which is attributed to David Letterman and Conan O'Brien. It's a variety show that sends up variety shows.<br /><br />In the first season DVD set, you could trace the development of the characters, particularly Miss Piggy. She went from being a chorus girl (often with differing voices) to a major international star. I'll never forget when Siskel and Ebert went into a lengthy debate about her performance in The Great Muppet Caper, before catching themselves in the absurdity of it all (\\"Can you believe we're talking about a piece of foam with more depth than many flesh and blood actors performing today?\\")<br /><br />By season three, the show had found its identity and gained the kind of clout and chic that attracted the \\"in\\" celebrities of the day (Gilda Radner, for example). Ironically, some of these guest stars are the most dated aspects of the series. The bizarre, unpredictable style of a series at its peak is very much in evidence. The Loretta Lynn episode takes place in a railroad station, the Marisa Berenson show features the \\"wedding\\" of Kermit and Piggy, and the Lynn Redgrave show is an original musical version of \\"Robin Hood.\\"<br /><br />For fans of \\"Muppet*Vision 3-D\\" at the Disney parks, there are echoes in the Spike Milligan episode (which has a \\"Small World\\" finale) and the masterful show with Pearl Bailey that randomly combines Broadway show tunes with reckless abandon.<br /><br />Not much in the way of extras, though the \\"Muppets on Puppets,\\" a black and white documentary created for public TV in 1968, is a treat. A sweet new documentary short, \\"The Making of The Muppets,\\" is just that, sweet but short. It would have been nice to have more of those pop-ups that added so much inside info to the Season One set -- not that I'm complaining, though, I'm just glad to have this show on DVD and love sharing it with the kids.omly combines Broadway show tunes with reckless abandon.

B000028U0Y|5.0|I have to say, I have come to realize this is one of my favorite albums of TIME tied with Houston Marchman's - Naked The Best of Houston Marchman.  Both are soooo good and I can listen to their voices over and over again and never get tired.  Houston Marchman is special in that his music is filled with soul, passion, and solid lyrics.  He truley has THE best singing vioce I have ever heard in my entire life.  You should check out the cd if you enjoy j CASH.  Both have the best songs EVER!
B00169XU8I|3.0|i am an old Madonna fan (before ray of light album)and kind of dis-like the new Madonna because i used to love each song that Madonna sing in one album but since ray of light she became degrading and loosing her power of enjoyment as she reached to some none Madonna to please the audience.   in this album the songs that deserve to be listen too are Voices, Miles away, 4 minutes, & beat goes on with little bit of candy shop but the rest is almost good. and if you are a FAN of Madonna then don't miss this limited edition. it's a black box, tiny booklet of Madonna's photo session, with sweet candy inside. and i guess you'll like it.

0312323859|5.0|I loved Something Borrowed and I admit, I was a bit skeptical of Something Blue because it was all about Darcy (instead of Rachel and Dex).  The first half of Something Blue was more of Darcy and her self-absorbed self, but when she finally is forced to face the truth about herself the rest of the story is wonderful & sweet.  I found myself rooting for Darcy and I loved the ending!  Don't hesitate to buy this set, but definitely get both of the books together so you can read them right after each other!
B0015XASFS|5.0|Great album indeed.  Very original.  I just listened to Chris Hericho though, who is the lead singer of Fozzy.  Their new album LALL that remains Reloaded it probably one of the best of the year.  Man, I really didn't expect such good music coming from a wrestler.  It really exceeded my expectations.  Chris Jericho is truley a talented man and a great singer as well as image for Fozzy...quite simply the best band EVER.  To put it this way I have recommended this album to 6 of my friends and all 6 listened to the CD and immediately purchased it.  SO ladies and gentlemen I will say this ... it will not disappoint  GET FOZZY!
B000002WPI|5.0|I should not have to write a review for this album For this album compares to the Beetles White album or Mozart. what fans (and Non Fans) of the Wu-tang Clan do not really realize is this album was a necessity for the east coast during this time. a lot of artist and albums after Enter the 36 pretty much copied this formula of lyrics, Beat making, and even group affiliation. back then it was unheard of to have Nine Emcee's (who all had an exceptional level of skill) in a group. but since this album, you had the boot camp clique, Flipmode squad, terror squad, and the dirty dozen (commonly known as D 12). Lyrics took a dramatic turn to be way more metaphorical. Rhyme schemas were influenced, story telling became more dramatic, Beats became more raw & more complexed. Alot of producers today are Directly or indirectly influenced by the Rza. The rza was the first beat maker who put a singing samples over lyrics. He was also the first to infuse far eastern samples and sounds with raw hip hop drums and bass. I can go on for days about this album but for the people who have not heard this album it is O.K . because this is one of the great albums of the 20th cenutry that will be studied in furture years to come.
B000084T18|5.0|This was a great album by 50.  His lyrics touch me on so many different levels.  It kind of reminds me of the new album Sparkplug by Bmoc and DJ Shan.  It's all great stuff.
B0000047CX|5.0|Wonderful and relaxing music.  Very soft, wonderful sound tracks.  There are two soundtracks of \\"The Girl From Ipanema,\\" with the first being the ultimate recording.  I would highly recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys cool jazz or any relaxing International-style music.
B000000OPQ|5.0|Maybe,it were not a very good film, although is acceptable.   It's worth just to listen to his music while the kid is on training in Spokane.   The soundtrack is really good, from start to end.   Great rock, Journey, Dio, Red Rider, Foreigner,Don Henley and the masterpiece SHOUT TO THE TOP, one of the best songs by Weller (The Style Council).   Play this CD on your car, you'll kill the road under your wheels!   This CD is great. Don't hesitate, buy it.

I can listen to the whole album without skipping a single song. That is rare for me. My favorites are Love in this Club(Part I and II), Trading Places, Love You Gently, Before I Met You, Appetite, and Lifetime. Thank you Usher!!!!!!
B00005JPTK|5.0|I Am Legend is one of my all time favorite films. The story line keeps a good pace and it follows a path that is unpredictable and engaging. I strongly recommend this movie, but I was disappointed in the special features of the second disc in this set. The alternate version was almost exactly the same as the theatrical version with only a couple of inserted scenes, and the \\"controversial alternate ending\\" was just odd and didn't fit with rest of the movie at all. There were no deleted scenes, \\"making of\\" features, outtakes or any of the normal special features. Oh, and the digital copy the you get with this version... doesn't work with Macs or iPods by the way... so what are you going to do with it? Load up you hard drive with the data of a complete movie? Why would you do that when you have the DVD? My advice is to save your money and by the regular version of this movie or wait until the film makers come to their senses and make a real special edition.
B00005JLZN|5.0|So this movie is well directed and nicely acted in, but the biting part is the social commentary that is involved here.<br />The plot involves the imprisonment of a college professor for murder and he is facing death row.  The ironic part is that he was one of the leading anti-death penalty advocates while he was still working.  Now, the problem come because he swears his innocence and wants a reported to attempt to find the true killer for him.<br />This is a beautifully played out story that teaches people the horrors and problems with the death penalty in America, but does not preach to us.  I had nothing but good things to say after seeing this movie and it summed up a lot of my feelings in it as well.
0060005696|5.0|Very good book. Highly recommended. Especially for those out there who have a tough time making decisions.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|\\"Posterity! You will never know how much it cost us to preserve your freedom. I hope you will make a good use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in Heaven that I ever took half the pains to preserve it.\\"<br />- John Adams 1777<br /><br />HBO did a fine job with the John Adams miniseries and took great pains to get \\"most\\" of the historical details correct.  It aptly showed how both John and Abigail sacrificed so much in terms of their marriage and their family to help create and foster the birth of this fine nation.  There was also somewhat of a more balanced storyline perspective as to fault: Colonists versus the British monarchy.  It also portrayed the great love that most of the colonists had for Britain and their former roots and the great reluctance that faced many of them.<br /><br />There are seven segments in the saga which spans from 1770 until John Adams' death in 1826.  Much of the  storyline is based upon David McCullough's exceptional book on John Adams by the same name..<br /><br />The seven segments are as follows:<br />Part I: Join or Die (1770 - 1774)<br />Part II: Independence (1774 - 1776)<br />Part III: Don't Tread on Me (1776 - 1781)<br />Part IV:  Reunion (1781 - 1789)<br />Part V: Unite or Die (1789 - 1797)<br />Part VI:  Unnecessary War (1797 - 1801)<br />Part VII:  Peacefield (1801 - 1826)<br /><br />What is nice about the miniseries is that it can be divided up into manageable blocks which can be watched and discussed or debated with family and friends.  There are so many issues discussed which will sound very familiar even to us today.  To think that it took thirty six ballots to elect Thomas Jefferson because there was a tie in the number of votes for each of two candidates is absolutely amazing.  The founding fathers were willing to let elections and the nomination process take its course and they allowed a lot of discussion to take place and \\"compromise\\".  I have to say that there were some historical liberties taken with the miniseries but it did not detract from the story itself or the core of the story's fabric: John and Abigail Adams' life of service to their country.  In fact the entire Adams family paid a price in one way or another for this dedication and devotion without which our country may have floundered and not survived.  Adams was extremely instrumental in this country's creation, nurturing and survival.<br /><br />To own this series is a very wise investment especially if you are a history buff.  The starkness of the surroundings and how they were portrayed in the film seemed on target to me.  The background seemed to match the moods of the Adams themselves and what the characters had to go through to endure and not give up.<br /><br />Laura Linney and Paul Giamatti as the Adams couple were superb.  But I had to say that once again I was very impressed with Stephen Dillane and his portrayal.  I appreciated his rendition of  Jefferson as much as I liked Dillane in Anna Karenina (another surprise performance).<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson had some fine moments as Ben Franklin and David Morse was superb as George Washington.  Rufus Sewell played Alexander Hamilton and I have to say after Sewell's performance I disliked Hamilton as much as I disliked the character he played in the movie \\"The Holiday\\".  His performance was also spot on as the \\"insensitive and manipulative\\" Hamilton.<br /><br />What impressed me was the intimate look at the dynamics of these perilous times when our country was born.  So much could have gone wrong and did; and without great sacrifices from great men; everything could have been different.  Very different.<br /><br />Posterity has a lot to be grateful for.  You have to wonder whether we are capable of the sacrifices that so many had to make to preserve and keep our freedoms.  Our forefathers were made of the right stuff as were those who fought in all of our wars to protect us back home.  It just seemed to me at the conclusion of this very moving dramatizationthat there is a recurring theme which reminded me of a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 and the resulting poster which read: \\"Never was so much owed by so many to so few.\\"<br /><br />Recommended: A-<br /><br />Bentley/2008<br />[[ASIN:B000WGWQG8 John Adams (HBO Miniseries)]]urchill in 1940 and the resulting poster which read: \\"Never was so much owed by so many to so few.\\"    Recommended: A-    Bentley/2008  [[ASIN:B000WGWQG8 John Adams (HBO Miniseries)]]

B00133KFGW|5.0|So there are many parts of this movie that you know could never happen, as many reviewers point out. My biggest, if I would allow myself to scrutinize this movie, is why would a cute 11 year old be in an orphanage from day one? Would not happen here in NY. But so what?? It was a beautiful story all the way around. Truly a beautiful story. I would not change one thing. I felt the ending was a good fit and understood the way it all came together, they found him through the music as he intended.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Honestly, does it get any funnier than Sean Connery yelling out, \\"You're the man now, dog!\\"  That's priceless.  Not only is it funny because it's Connery using modern day slang, it's also because the usage of the word \\"dog\\" went out of style faster than...well, it never was cool to say.  The saying, however, is as timeless as \\"more cowbell\\" and \\"My name is Inigo Montoya...\\" - it just gets better each time it's heard.<br /><br />Another classic line is when Connery belts out, \\"PUNCH the keys for God's sake!\\"  It's not quite up to YTMND standards, but PTKFGS is nonetheless hilarious.<br /><br />The movie itself is highly inspirational and entertaining.  William Forrester (Connery) is a reclusive, agoraphobic, Pulitzer Prize winning author living in Harlem.  He's somewhat of a neighborhood boogeyman, and one day a prodigous yet troubled talent named Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) dares to sneak into the apartment.  Forrester scares him away, and in his haste, Wallace drops his backpack with his writings.  Some time later the work is returned, but all the papers are edited and reviewed.  In no time at all, the two are friends, Forrester is reviewing all of Wallace's work, and the two famous lines are uttered.<br /><br />The struggle and relationship between student and teacher is truly fabulous to watch in this movie.  And when Wallace attempts to help his teacher, or to coax out any sort of information, there is a palpable tension.  The true battle eventually unfolds between Wallace, his school, and his professor, where someone must sacrifice in order to help the other.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie in every circumstance.  It's a feel good movie with true life-lessons.
B0000633T6|3.0|This is one Robert Redford performance I really enjoy.  He has created a number of memorable characters during his long career but this role is so intelligently crafted and played with utter sincerity that it is for me a standout.  Redford is a CIA employee at the end of his career and the film shows his career over a number of years as it interacts with Brad Pitt, who is an idealistic assassin.  Redford's bosses want information on Pitt and are questioning Redford and the mind games commence.  It is unusual to find a Hollywood movie with intelligent writing and I appreciated the convincing script here.  The one major factor that undermines the film is a sappy music score by Harry Gregson which is a distraction just when it needs to be supportive of the action.  But if you can get around the annoying boy soprano who shows up singing the same theme several times during the story you will see a superior performance from Robert Redford in a story that makes you think.
B0014DFCMS|4.0|This is a great movie, and I recently purchased a Blu-ray player so I decided to purchase the Blu-ray format.  Although I was not as impressed with the high defintion of this movie as I was with other Blu-ray movies (in particular CGI movies and movies with special effects), some of the scenes still do show spectacular imaging and colors that you would not find in a normal definition DVD.  So I wouldn't say that this is a must have Blu-ray DVD, but it's not necessarily a waste of money for the upgrade either.  No matter what you are getting a great movie.
0385338724|4.0|I always look forward to a good Sophie Kinsella book, though I have to admit a strong preference for the Shopaholic series.  The standalones have all been good, this one included, but I just don't enjoy the narrators as much as I do Becky.    With all of that said, I did find this book to be another very amusing offering.  The gimmick of the loss of memory was a good trick for launching the story and Sophie Kinsella is so good at making life seem amusing.      I really did enjoy this book a lot, but it wasn't quite up to the level of the Shopaholic books.  Still, it is very much worth the read, especially if you're a fan.  By the way, has anyone else read any of the Madeleine Wickham books?  I just found out that she IS Sophie Kinsella!

0425220931|5.0|I've read and reviewed a book by another musician, Kenny Werner, called 'Effortless Mastery'. Some of the things covered in that book are touched upon in Victor's book, The Music Lesson. However, I must say that Victor has certainly found a way to show us the intangibles of music while demystifying so much of what holds we musicians back from really playing. His treatise on music brings to the fore important elements not usually emphasized in a practicing musician's learning. I found the book to be extremely practical while completely engrossing. Victor's decided approach to the subject at hand is unique, clever, and enjoyable. Much like his character in the book (Victor Wooten), I can't remember the last time I had so much fun learning the 'abc's' of music and more to the point, life itself!     One last comment about the book which I am surprised no one else has mentioned (at least if they did I missed it), and that is the proximity of one Jaco Pastorius to the Michael character. I find myself wanting to ask, is Michael Jaco? I am amazed that that question doesn't seem to be answered at all in the book's pages (again, unless I missed it). Then again, maybe it is so obvious, it is I who am a fool for bringing it up.     Either way, I highly recommend this book for a really great read.

0439882826|5.0|I just write to say that my son is four years old and he is already a very big Star Wars fan and that he just love this book. That book covers about everything for episodes 4-5-6. The pop-ups are very imaginatives and ingenious but I would recommend not to let you kid manipulate it especially if he or she is as young as my son. Some of the pop-ups are so complex that even I have to be carefull when I unfold them.      The last pop-up has definetly a very nice touch to it with the two light-up caracters poping up (Luke and darth Vader).  A must for every Star wars fan!
B00005JPNZ|4.0|Harrison Ford is amazing in \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\".  His physical acting ability has always impressed me.  But now that he's much older than he was in the first film (difficult to believe the first film came out 27 years ago!), he astounds!  Sadly, I didn't detect the chemistry between Ford and Karen Allen that was present in \\"Raiders\\", but his scenes with Shia LaBoeuf were magical.  The story was fair, but true to the \\"Indy\\" franchise, the roller coaster began when the lights came up on the screen.  I absolutely LOVED how they incorporated the Paramount mountain into the opening sequence.  These are some very talented movie-makers.  I will own this DVD and watch it over and over, noticing something new each time, I'm sure.
0446402389|5.0|The beginning of CHILD 44, Oxford graduate Tom Rob Smith's debut novel, is unrelentingly grim. It is a double-time, stiff-legged forced march through the forbidding and unforgiving landscape of Soviet Ukraine in 1933, featuring a description of two brothers who are trying to catch a stray cat. They are, you see, very, very hungry.    Most of CHILD 44 takes place over the course of a stark four months some two decades after the boys chase that unfortunate cat, in the Stalin-era, post-World War II Soviet Union. The State is god, and its enforcer is the State Security Force (MGB), which rules with an Orwellian terror. Owning the wrong book or saying the wrong thing can earn a one-way ticket to the Gulag for 20 years. As Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn so famously pointed out, if you did nothing, you only received a seven-year sentence.    Leo Demidov is one of the best MGB officers, a war hero and an idealist who has reaped the rewards of his position, not the least of which are his beautiful wife and their relatively comfortable apartment in Moscow. But his world is turned upside down when he is targeted by an underling and abruptly demoted. Shipped with his wife to a grim industrial city in the Russian wilderness, Demidov suffers the ultimate humiliation, serving as the equivalent of a small-town cop in a country where there officially is no crime. He is horrified when he investigates the murder of a young boy in the area that has dark but unmistakable similarities to an earlier slaying that supposedly had been solved and, worse, bears an unsettling resemblance to the death of a child in Moscow that Demidov, with implicit pressure from his superiors, had classified as an accident.    Demidov is sure that a monster prowls throughout Russia, killing youngsters at will, and feels duty-bound to investigate. But how can he investigate a crime that does not exist? The State has decreed itself a paradise, and to declare otherwise is tantamount to treason. Having already lost everything, Demidov does not have much farther to fall, yet he feels he has a duty to stop the evil soul that roams the nation seemingly invisible and at will. To do so, however, he will have to confront not only his past but also the truth about his life, his marriage and his very existence, even as the investigation leads to a surprising and shocking climax.    Tom Rob Smith's subject matter is the stuff of waking nightmares. While comparisons to GORKY PARK are probably inevitable, such are appropriate only with regard to locale and to time period (and then, only roughly). Smith manages to infuse the story with unique twists and turns that will catch even long-time thriller readers by surprise. Exquisitely plotted and wonderfully but fearfully told, CHILD 44 is one of this year's wonders.        --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
0439813786|5.0|My grandson and I read this book together.  He would read a chapter and I would read a chapter.  He often would beg me to let him read two or three chapters each evening.    Hugo is a boy who was resilient and clever.  This made him interesting for my grandson and for me as well.  The graphics were beautiful and told as much of the story as the written words.      This is clearly my grandson's favorite book.  Move over Magic Tree House Series, there is some serious reading going on here.
B00009W0U4|4.0|Written, directed, edited, and photographed by the Argentinian-born French Gaspar Noe and released in 2002. Irreversible starts from where Noe's previous work (Seul Contre Tous) left us, and with the same character: the butcher; only to diverge shortly after into a separate entity.<br />\\"Irreversible\\" is not by any mean a linear continuum to \\"Seul Contre Tous\\" but the initial (and only) sequence featuring the previous protagonist would emphasize the fact that Irreversible will deal with a similar territoire: nihilism, absurdism, existentialism.<br /><br />Noe's cinematography is strikingly remarkable for computer-edited long sequences (merging into very few long scenes). The camera is so shaky initially, and continuously rotating giving the feeling of confusion and loss (adding the smart voice sound effect). As the movie progresses folding back in time (retrospective), things will make more sense and at the same time the camera would become less and less lost, more focused, and more light would dissipate into the picture. The movie reaches a climax after what the picture becomes intensely (and unrealistically) monochromatic, only to reach complete blurriness.<br /><br />Irreversible is not a movie for everybody at all, it needs a lot of \\"open-mindness\\", it contains one of the most violent scenes I've ever scene. Noe's camera is as intrusive and as rude as the horror and the violence it captures, and refuses to drive away from an ugly scene.<br /><br />Compared to his previous (Seul Contre Tous), I see Irreversible as more shocking and more confident. Bellucci gives a remarkable performance (only surpassed by her performance in Tornatore's Malena)

B00140PK6O|5.0|Help, I'm stuck in a small, Victorian town being pleasantly spied on by a bunch of sweet, proper, opinionated, gossipy, nosey, and at times, crazy Cranford women!  I'm due for a timely visit from two elderly sisters who know everything about everyone.    This is not Jane Austen, although there are similarities.  There are groups of women, lots of relationships, humor and romance; however,  death, disease and disaster also rear up and are more prevalent, and exposed here.      The author, Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) lived after Austen, and wrote the great novels to PBS movies of 'North and South', Wives and Daughters' and was friends with Charlotte 'don't call me Jane Ayre' Bronte.  Gaskell penned Bronte's Biography after her demise, and it was in Charles Dicken's mag, 'Household Words' that Cranford appeared in 1853.    Bringing this enchanting place to a 5-hour period piece is an immense undertaking, and BBC does a great job at it.  After the recent downpour of Jane Austen/Jane Ayre re-do's, one wonders if there are any towns left to film in England not seen, any English actors not used, any costumes, music, directors, etc., etc., not indulged.  Well, it's a different time period than Austen's, and one can't ever get enough English countryside or actors, such as Judi Dench and Eileen Atkins, who portray the sisters and are simply marvelous.  Their characters compliment and confront each other perfectly.  Atkins plays the crusty one but with a good heart.  Dench is sweet and knowing, and through their eyes, Cranford unfolds.  On the higher, social spectrum, Lady Ludlow(Francesca Annis) reigns solo, gripping tightly onto her fading world and aplomb.     It's not just a world of older matriarchs, but of young love and misunderstandings, professional clashes between generations, and the ever dominating class struggles.  The movie hops and interacts between all the storylines in potpourri fashion, sometimes outrageously funny, other times sad but not morose.  Amazingthat the editing flows so well.      Although it's not as light and frisky as the BBC/A&E 'Pride and Prejudice' (a tough comparison!), it merits it own applause as a very fine, very 'proper' comedy/drama.  And apparently a sequel is planned.  I guess I'll never get out of this town.  Enjoy.

I found this to be superb. It was so amazing and awe inspiring the picture Brooks paints in this book.It is full of so much heartache and so much horror, yet you have to keep going to see how it ends up. If you have any sort of interest in zombies, or anything of the fiction genre, check this out.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|2.5 stars.  Love, actually is a cute mindless movie-an anthology of short stories crammed into one screenplay and the results is a paint-by-numbers un-authentic pot-luck soup of emotions.  Nighy is hilarious as an aging rocker desperate for a number one hit, but everyone else seemed to phone in their performance on a script that clearly didn't seem worth their time.  Still, the movie can help pass the time but so can scrubbing the bathroom tile.
1582701709|3.0|This book was overall very informative. You have to wade through the book and decipher what you want to believe and what you don't. The information on the law of attraction is very informative. What you place in your mind is what you will receive. However, there is some information that you have to take with a grain of salt such as, if you associate with fat people you will be fat. That just isn't so. Also it says if your sick it's because you want to be sick. Do infants want to be sick too? Do the people dieing miserable deaths decide thats how they wanted to die? I think not. Before reading the book keep in mind some information is worth attaining and some is not.

The cons: well some pictures and stories were entertaining but not inspirational.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was not the greatest story I have ever read, but it was definitely the most inspiring. This book, by Mitch Albom, is a story about two people, both with the same views on life, except one needs help realizing it. The main point of view character is Mitch himself. He is a well known sports writer who's life revolves around his job. The other character, Morrie, is an old professor of Mitch's who he lost touch with who is now dying of ALS. Mitch sees his old professor on TV & decides to visit him after 10 years of no contact. Starting then, Mitch flies to Morrie's house every day just to talk. The book has practically no action & may be boring for some people. Basically the whole story takes place in one room with just two guys talking. But excitement isn't the point of the story. The words that come out of Morrie's mouth are philosophical & inspiring. He speaks words about the meaning of life that are enough to open almost anyones eyes about their main priorities. But not only are his words brilliant, but his actions are even more, & we all know actions speak louder than words. Throughout his whole struggle with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis he is positive & brave & not once does he make a pessimistic statement or complain about his state. His body was slowly breaking down, for Christ's sake, & throughout the whole book he hardly let it get to him. His main priorities throughout the whole book were passing his perspectives on to Mitch & visiting with old family & friends to see how they are. If that is not selflessness than I don't know what is. I think that this book is a wonderful read for anyone who needs just a little guidance & probably interesting for anyone else who has life all figured out. It has a much bigger point than a book about someone else's life that is oh so much greater than yours. It's realistic, it's original, & I definitley recommend it.

B00005LIN0|1.0|I read your reviews of P&B productions and settled on this one because of a glowing report by someone.  I was very disappointed.  First, it was at least 30 minutes too long.  It could easily have been an hour shorter with nothing important left out.  Good photography and sound, good singing and acting for the most part, but \\"Summertime\\" was far too slow in tempo.  Maddeningly slow.  George would never have allowed that.  But the worst was the ending, with Porgy suddenly able to walk, just like Amahl!  How corny can you get???  What made the producers think they could improve the story?  And why a cane instead of a wheeled cart?  What makes modern fools think they can improve on a classic?  A fatal delusion.  I'll have to keep looking for a better production.  Any suggestions?  Richard
0061015725|3.0|Crichton tells a moderately good story, but this book needs editing.  The text is too wordy, yet there is little character development. The dialogue is unnatural .  Scientific information about nanotechnology is blended into tales of dishonest, scheming employers; medical risks and technology-gone-wrong, and extramarital affairs.  Crichton should correct his many grammatical errors, or hire an editor to do so.

If you love silent movies like I do, or are looking for the penultimate vampire movie, look no further.

0143038419|4.0|I ordered this book after watching the Oprah show, which I found revitalizing and was curious about the book.  I also sent it to my daughter in England.  I am due to retire after 25 years working at a school and looking for ideas to start my new life.    I found the book very interesting, but not as revalational as I expected.  I was waiting until the end for the true meaning of life, but felt rather let down as it was more like a love story with a lovely happy ending.  The book merely said what I already knew that happiness comes from within and you have to work at living.    My daughter also enjoyed the book and passed it on to a friend.      Well worth a read as a nice book, but not very inspiring.    Janet Edwards
B000URDEB0|3.0|It was a decent album.  Certainly no where near as good as Once but still decent.  With out Tarja NW just doesnt seem to be able to project like they once did.  The band also seems to be trying to over due it.  While initially  they would work with their singer they now seem to be trying to overplay their music and making the singing a backdrop.  All together there is nothing wrong with the music it just seems to run on in a lot of places where they should be switching over to letting the singer lead.    Again I say its a decent album.. one which I hope NW certainly take as a learning experience with their new singer and try to evolve more.
B000M341QE|1.0|From such a good cast and director I expected much better than this. Its unbelievable, poor dialogue, bad acting, and way too long. The movie doesnt explain what motivates an intelligent, highly motivated character (Damon) to be drawn into being a mob insider. There was a good story here but its lost in the poor dialogue and unbelievable characters. (Also the overuse of the fword does not come across well in this movie as in say a Tarantino flick.)

B000UJCALI|3.0|Without Jack Nicholson, this so-so movie wouldn't be worth the effort.  But Jack really shines through (as he often does) and makes this flick almost work.  The script and storyline fall short of representing this great Stephen King novel.  The true explanation of what is happening is never given in the movie.  You're left wondering what the whole thing was about.  Scatman Crothers was a wonderful choice in the role of Halloran, the cook who tells Danny about 'the shining'.  The boy who played Danny did a good job as the kid.  Shelley Duvall is supurb at acting scared, but otherwise fails to carry the role of Jack's wife Wendy.  For the most part, the acting, script, pacing and overall effect fell short of its target.  Too many short cuts were taken, such as having a hedge maze instead of hedge animals, and the cheesy ending that was cheaper to shoot than it would have been if they had ended the movie properly according to the novel.  Decent special effects...occasionally almost scary.  Jack Nicholson does a great job of saving this movie, but there is such a drag factor in so many of the movie's downfalls, it's still only worth 3 stars.  If you're a big Jack N. fan, get it.  Otherwise, I can't highly recommend this so-so flick.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|I'd heard good things about this movie before I saw it but i went with an open mind cos I know how movies can get over-hyped.  WOW, when my friends and I left the cinema we were all raving about what an amazing film it was.    The storyline is very simple, a monster attacks NY and people are trying to get away from it - End of! What more do you need to know?  The fact that there aren't any really famous actors in it definitely works in the movies' favour cos it seems much more believable.    To be honest, i was so engrossed in the movie, i didn't really notice the shakey camerawork that lots of people are complaining about.  This movie deserves to be seen on the biggest screen you can find.  I can't wait for it to be released in England so that i can watch it on my   50\\" screen tv.  Definitely one of the best films I have seen in many years (and i see at least 2 new movies every week!)

B0015519VS|3.0|Its been awhile since we've gotten a new Usher cd.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Usher since his debut effort years ago and have watched his career go through the roof.  But with Here i Stand, its different for him because he's married and has a kid.  So a lot of what applied to him and worked on other cds probably wouldnt fit right for him now.<br /><br />I did enjoy several songs off the cd without question.  Like \\"Love in This Club (Part I and II w/Beyonce and Lil Wayne), \\"Moving Mountains\\", \\"Best Thing\\" w/Jay-Z, \\"What's Your Name\\" w/will.i.am, \\"Appetite\\", \\"His Mistakes\\" and \\"Before I Met You\\".  Normally that would be enough for me to warrant at least giving this one 4 stars at least.<br /><br />But this time around it just feels like something's left out or missing.  I'm not quite sure what.  There are more slower ballad style songs on here for one while not a bad thing at all.  It seems to slow the cd down a bit too much even for my tastes and i love a slow jam just like the next person.<br /><br />Usher writes on every song on \\"Here I Stand\\" and comes through with his personal feelings and thoughts on life throughout the cd itself and working with some all star producers won't hurt the sales at all for the cd.  Which will probably debut at number 1 on the next billboard chart and sell loads which i really look forward to seeing.<br /><br />Overall though \\"Here I Stand\\" just leaves me wondering for the most part.

However, for those who have an interest in the growth and maturing of an iconic musician McCartney is a must have. The rawness of the production and individuality of this one man show (with the exception of Linda's vocals) perhaps was what Paul needed to continue musically post-Beatles.     For you younger listeners, with no interest in the growth of Paul's talent, get the three tracks at the very least.

0618918248|2.0|Richard Dawkins let out his naturalistic primal scream \\"God is a fairytale\\" in a disappointing 420 pages.  He breezes through philosophy, theology and history with scarcely a serious argument.  He cherry-picks sociological data and uses (endlessly) every well-known (or is it shop worn?) atheistic quip from the last 100 years.   He is in his best form when he is speaking of natural selection (chapter 4).  His handling of details shows a great depth of specialization in evolutionary biology.  However, his \\"proof\\" of God's non-existence is puzzling in the end, almost sophomoric.     Chapters 5 and 6 are interesting in exploring the proposed answers a strictly naturalistic understanding of religion presents.  But unless one assumes this is no God to begin with these explainations do not make the Deity any less likely to exist.    The rest of the book is rather lame and poorly thought out.  Dawkins is very good at letting us know he is angry and that he literally despises theists of any stripe.  A critical reader can see that Dawkins simply assumes his conclusion (atheism, or more precisely naturalism) from the outset and does not seriously interact with any theistic ideas or arguments (except as caricatures).  And then HE is upset that Christians are so \\"stupid\\"!    Dawkins is funny at times and occasionally eloquent for his implicit humanistic/naturalistic creed.  But mostly he is just angry, and in the end has presented us with just a polemic (bordering on a harangue).  Dawkins does not abide any \\"truth\\" that can't be contained or expounded upon via a tightly controlled scientific experiment.  It is this constained notion of \\"truth\\" more than anything else that explains Dawkins and this mis-named book.
B0015519VS|2.0|Based on the first single \\"Love In This Club\\", I thought this Usher release was going to be great and exciting. After listening to the entire CD, this was, for me, a rather weak release. My problems with it are mainly that it lacks spirit and variety, all the songs at first listening pretty much sounding similar and few chances being taken to show that Usher's grown as an artist. Another problem is that Usher seems to have suffered the same fate that many married artists do; the songs seem to be written about his relationship or he's attempting to debunk the rumors of the media and tabloids through song. For me, it didn't work.<br /><br />What I did like were those songs like \\"Love In This Club\\" on the album that really stand out and have feeling matched with great production value. \\"Moving Mountains\\" and \\"His Mistakes\\" both speak of being burned by love and having a few missteps in a relationship. These songs give you chills and manage to make you a bit misty and teary eyed with how relatable they are. I also enjoyed \\"Trading Places\\" which is about sex but sets up a curious and playful situation lyrically with some great vocal work. \\"Love in this Club, Part II\\" is also fun simply because it features Beyonc&eacute; and is a total reworking of the song. The Lil Wayne part of the song is weak, but still, I appreciate that for once instead of just having two artist singing over the regular track, someone took the time to totally revamp the song and the feel of it.<br /><br />Then, the other songs fall flat. The production value isn't great, making some of the songs sound as if they are mix tape quality and in need of more mixing. Usher goes on to sing about women and sex, his two main subject matters, but at this point in his career they simply sound tired and overdone. The other songs on the CD compete with one another due to the sound and lack of excitement put into it. It makes me wonder if some of these songs were rushed through and shows you that an abundance of songs on a cd isn't always a necessarily good thing. It loses my attention and many of these track have 'b-side' quality to them making them fluff and skip-worthy.<br /><br />In all, let down by this release and feel it was or has been over-hyped and weak.

B001437DMA|4.0|Going through others reviews I can see the mixed feelings.  I, too, am a devoted fan of the man who redefined instrumental rock forever.  I found 6 excellent tracks in this new album, although none matches the greatest of his past songs.  But for these 6 songs (the first 4 and the last 2) it is well worth listening to Satchafunkilus every day.    Music is all a matter of feeling really.  If a song speaks to your guts, then you can't explain it, it just rocks your world and you love it.  Too many reviewers are trying to rationalize why this CD is good but not great for their taste.  Stop your erudition guys.  If Joe wants to make the guitar the dominant instrument, then so be it.  With all due respect, this is why we became a fan in the first place.  The same is true if Joe wants to ask his musician to strictly adhere to his composition.  I think Joe is a MASTER COMPOSER and you have to respect his musical choice.  He earned that much.  When Mozart composed a symphony he did not ask his musicians to add their own part to it, and no critique would ever criticize Mozart for being insistent that his musicians respect his music.  And yes, I dare to compare Joe to Mozart, regardless of the difference of style and music culture, they both are true to their musical inspiration and have earned our respect.    And so, I am actually disappointed at some of the reviews.  If you don't like certain songs that's fine, say so, but spend more time sharing what you like rather than what you don't like and please, please, please, stop telling Joe what he should do, or which musicians he should play with and where he should record his next album.  What is your purpose?    As I said in my intro, I found 6 excellent songs on this album.  Musterion has a subtle ethereal intro and I find the \\"voice\\" of that song very gutsy.  The solo is magnificent.  Next comes Overdriver, a pure rock song with once again a distinctive \\"voice\\" that seems to speak to us, and superb changes in rhythm with underlying echoes.  I Just Wanna Rock is almost ACDC-esque.  To those who do not want any more crowd song, I object vigorously: I love this song - thank you Joe.  It starts with a very apropos question: What is your Purpose?  And I ask myself that every day.  The answer can be as simple as I Just Wanna Rock.  No need to make it too complicated.  Perhaps life has no purpose but to simply be.  I agree with one other review out there, the solo on this song is outstanding and ferocious.  Then comes Professor Satchafunkilus, the most difficult song to appreciate on this album.  It defies the traditional Satch's song with intro-rhythm-voice-solos-chorus etc.  The song seems to go on smoothly at its own pace without solo and major crescendo, yet it will seduce you if you continue to let your soul transported by the many layers of the guitars.  Listen to it with a headphone and you will see what I mean.  It is as if many voices are screaming their little part from every direction.  It is an AWESOME song.  I do not care for the next 4 songs, and I skip straight to Asik Veysel, which is a sort of balad similar in creative foundation to Searching from the album Is There Love Into Space.  I like the journey the song inspires and the beautiful extended solo.  The more I listen to the song the more I am getting impatient to see it live.  Finally, Andalusia.  This one also requires many listen.  It has a force that I can't fathom.  It is like a group of three tenors in an opera taking turn for their part.  Mesmerizing!    Satchafunkilus overall is better than Super Colossal and just below Is There Love Into Space.  My favorite albums remain Strange Beautiful Music, Engines, Blue Dream and Crystal Planet.  Joe has so much in his repertoire it is becoming totally IMPRESSIVE.    What-is-your-purpose?  Listen and enjoy.
0312360266|4.0|If you buy this book, don't just put it down after reading the first few chapters. It really does have a bit of an \\"amature\\" feeling start. It's as if the Casts were trying to get a feel for story telling. The book gets much better about 6 or 7 chapters in! The ending is a bit abrupt, so I reccomend having the second book handy to get right into. I ended up liking it, and trust me, even if it's not your favorite series, you'll want to read the next books.

B000MCH5P4|3.0|I loved Inarritu's first film, \\"Amor es Perros,\\" not so much his second film, \\"21 Grams\\" which seemed overly contrived and relied too much on the non-linear narrative technique derivative of Quentin Tarantino.  \\"Babel\\" is his third film and continues the downward spiral into ever-greater style-over-substance.  It is all about grandiose intentions, gorgeous cinematography and soundtrack, a mediocre mega-star lead actor (Brad Pitt) cast mainly to create more of a mainstream/mass-appeal box office draw, and a generally cliched, heavy-handed and cornily predictable plot built upon a host of mostly two-dimensional characters.<br /><br />Pitt and Blanchett are the generic spoiled, narcissistic and miserable yuppy Americans who are helpless when calamity strikes them overseas, with two angelic-looking innocent and helpless little kids left back home under the care of an equally angelic and helpless illegal-immigrant Mexican nanny, who stupidly takes them to a wedding party in Tijuana with her crazy nephew (Gabriel Garcia Bernal, whose talent is wasted in a stock role here) driving.  Rinko Kikuchi plays a miserably lonely, isolated, and helpless deaf-mute teenager flailing around haplessly in the surreal and soulless landscape of urban Japan.  The only truly interesting, authentic, and emotionally involving characters were the Moroccans, in particular the Berber goatherding family whose two young sons initiate the whole movie's plot development through a series of stupid actions that have totally unforseen consequences.<br /><br />And that, for all the movie's sound and fury, is all that drives this work: the (gasp!) presentation of human life as the outcome of human folly and frailty which, due to our innate interconnectedness on a global and karmic level, like a hair-trigger can set off a flurry of tragic and destructive events, i.e. human suffering.  I suppose this might be a GINORMOUS revelation if one spends one's life glued to the boob tube watching \\"reality TV\\" shows (perhaps true for the legions of Brad Pitt fans that the casting company was hoping to reel in), but otherwise it's hardly earthshaking news.<br /><br />However, there are many films with prosaic themes, predictable plotlines and inflated pretentions that can still hold the viewer's interest.  \\"Babel\\" is not one of those, because it fails to follow the first rule of decent storytelling: create involving CHARACTERS that move the plot, rather than having the PLOT (especially one as didactic as this) move the characters as though in a puppet theater.<br /><br />It's still not as tedious as \\"Crash\\" though, thanks to the cinematography and score.  There are clear flashes of Inarritu's considerable directorial talents here and there; let's hope that his next (fourth) film will be worthy of it.for the legions of Brad Pitt fans that the casting company was hoping to reel in), but otherwise it's hardly earthshaking news.

B000X1Z0BU|2.0|The characters in this movie and the setting give it the makings of a wistful little movie well worth seeing, in particular,Markéta Irglováe, as the girl is truly a revelation.    BUT MAKE SURE YOU CAN LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC    The first time the guy and girl sit down to do a song together, it seems pleasant enough.  It's a bit histrionic and repetitious, but there is one good section of lyrics.  But, at least for my wife and me, thereafter, the music was all but intolerable.  It struck us as tedious, with lyrics that are juvenile at best.  You hear much of the same song over and over and worse, every other song employs the same tortured singing.    Well, the moral of the story here is that if you like small movies with not entirely predictable plots points and utterly decent folk as characters, this is a wonderful, four-star movie    IF YOU CAN STAND THE MUSIC.    Neither my wife nor I could and we have widely divergent tastes in music.  Listen to the first song on the soundtrack at least three times.  If you still like the song after that -- and like small movies, you will likely join the significant list of critics who raved about this movie.    But if you can't listen to that song three times in a row.  Watch this entire movie at your own risk.   It may rank among the least pleasant experiences of this year for you.
B0015519VS|4.0|Admittedly this is not \\"confessions.\\" But I already have that one. This is new and bit more mature and cultivated.  YOu might say mellow. I like seeing artists change and try different things. Some people don't like that. To each his own. I can't say its better than his last but I like it.
B00069YE0W|4.0|There are 3 great songs on here and the rest is ho hum.  John Fruscianti seems like he first writes lyrics (which are great), then attaches a vocal melody, then follows the vocal melody with guitar notes that match the vocal.  The few songs that break out of this furmula are great though.
B000002UDB|5.0|Yep, I'd heard plenty of Beatles' songs.  But when my brother gave me the LP (vinyl) of this album after it had come out, this was my first Beatles' recording. I wore it out playing it on my cheap record players and too-long-used needles. But it was a lot of fun while it lasted!<br /><br />The sound is a lot different from the early Beatles albums. There are some glorious songs on this CD--as well as a few idiosyncratic items.<br /><br />The CD begins with the title song, \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\"  A pleasing composition, with repetitive (almost hypnotic) lines.  A sampling:<br /><br />\\"Roll up--Roll up for the Magical Mystery Tour,<br />Roll up Roll up for the Mystery Tour.<br />I've got an invitation to make a reservation.\\"<br /><br />Psychedelic music that is still musical!<br /><br />This is followed by \\"The Fool on the Hill,\\" a simple tune with good keyboard work. Some lines:<br /><br />\\"And nobody seems to like him they can tell what he wants to do.<br />And he never shows his feelings but the Fool on the hill<br />Sees the sun going down. . . .\\"<br /><br />Then, the late Beatles' classic, \\"I Am the Walrus.\\"<br /><br />Remember the tag line?<br /><br />\\"I am the eggman, they are the eggmen<br />I am the walrus goo goo ga joo.\\"<br /><br />The CD closes out with a series of neat songs, one after the other--\\"Hello Goodbye,\\" \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" (I really like that song!), \\"Penny Lane (Another neat tune), \\"Baby You're A Rich Man,\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\" (a classic Beatles' work).<br /><br />Maybe not as well known or as well reputed as works recorded at about the same time (think Sgt. Pepper. . .), but an estimable work nonetheless.
B00104QSOM|3.0|Melville's THE CONFIDENCE MAN gets my vote for Great American Novel.  We Americans love our confidence men & women & when we are not busy giving them our money we love to watch news stories about them on TV.  This movie has 2 confidence men both oil salesmen:  One selling crude & the other snake.  Fortunately for us one of them (crude) is played by Daniel Day-Lewis who has been staring us down since scratching his way along the side of a car in SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY.  Here he gives us orotund John Huston vocals with cadences & pauses that would make Christopher Walken stomp with envy.  Paul Dano as the snake oil salesman has a few fine moments when he conveys his character's astonishment over how much money can be made off people whose unthinking & greed for 'pie in the sky' make them an easy source.  The supposed tension in the movie is the war these 2 have to best the other & to prevail.  There are big confrontations like those in Verdi's IL TROVATORE where the brothers (here the characters are brothers 'under the skin') act out their hate toward each other.  Paul Thomas Anderson, the director, doesn't seem to be interested in character or narrative.  He's all professionalism.  He has the mechanics of movie making down pat & his movies are often exciting & impressive.  But all his characters are just that--- characters bordering on grotesques.  And he confuses insight with confrontation.  After a while you realize almost none of his characters are likeable & all the ranting is just noise.  It's like going to a recital of scales by a gifted musician.  At first you're dazzled by the finger dexterity, the legato & the evenness of tone but after 5 minutes you want some real music.

B000OQF6N6|5.0|I really wish people would (inevitably) stop comparing it to their older material.. in my opinion it was a different era of (far, far better) music, which i'm not sure the Pumpkins would fit into if they released it now. Zeitgeist is, to me, an amazing and diverse album, and while it doesn't give the same 'feel' as previous albums, if you give it a chance without throwing it off as a sub-par CD and let it grow, it will be one of your favorite albums for a while to come in a time of fairly tragic music everywhere else.     People forget your bias to the 'older' Pumpkins and pick up a copy, you won't regret it.
B000JBWWRY|1.0|The Peter Pan cartoon is a classic, but the problem with this DVD is that Disney put about two hours of previews on this DVD set that you are forced to sit through before the actual movie comes on.

B0013FNC38|5.0|What goes up must come down, right?  Well no-one has told that to Mr A-Z, cos his albums deliver every single time.    Stand outs on this album for me are: I'm yours, Lucky, Butterfly, Love for a Child & Beautiful Mess.  And yet put each song on repeat for a couple of times and you'll see what a true masterpiece each is in its own right.  Mraz really is a lyrical genius, and scats better than anyone else I can name.    This album differs a bit from previous ones by being injected with constant energy (less of the ballads from previous albums), and a bigger sound with more of a Cat Empire style big band sound.  Jason's rose coloured world is infectious and if this album doesn't cheer you up when you are feeling down, seek medical advice!    I was a bit of a fan of Jason Mraz before this album, and I am a committed fan since buying it.  Can't seem to take it off repeat mode, and no-one at work seems to mind in the slightest. =o)

I commend them for trying something different with Foxboro Hot Tubs (garage rock) and The Network (Devoesque rock). Both efforts are worth your time and money.

B00005JPS7|5.0|Before I say anything, I have to say that I reluctantly saw this film. I was mildly curious about it (especially considering it's RD Jr's first big film in a while), but not really enough to want to pay to see it in the theaters. However, my father wanted to see it & I went. Boy was I glad that I did.<br /><br />The movie starts off with an action scene as well as a  bit of an info dump about Tony Stark for the newcomers like me. It doesn't last too overly long, so as not to bore the fans who are well versed in the lore of Iron Man. From there the movie can honestly be divided into three parts. The first concerns Stark's time as a prisoner of war and how he frees himself with the help of another prisoner (the birth of the first suit). The second concerns Stark's improvements of the suit as well as on the technology that is keeping him alive & how Stark tests out the suit. This is easily the most light hearted and thrilling part of the movie. The third is when Stark begins to discover who is behind the sale of his weapons to terrorists & the final showdown with the big baddie. All of these parts flow seamlessly into each other and overall the film is very cohesive. The ending had to have been one of the most awesome I've ever seen, although I must admit that I missed the bonus at the end of Nick Fury (I had to look for it on the net to see it afterwards).<br /><br />The acting was all first rate and I thoroughly enjoyed that the director & crew decided to bring out Paltrow's natural beauty rather than slather her face with makeup. It really lent an edge of \\"realism\\" to her character. The soundtrack was also incredibly good and it all fit the movie well. All in all, I'd give this film a 5/5. It deserves it. I may rate it lower after rewatching it at home, but at the moment I have to say that I really enjoyed it.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Alright so I love this movie.  I'm a dude an this stuff is dark, synical, and just damn funny.  You have to see it at least once.  The ending is enough of a jaw dropper.  If you don't buy this at least rent it... and if you don't rent this; then little elves will poke you while you sleep.... no seriously.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|As my father says, \\"Never anticipate any movie. View it as something to watch for enjoyment only and you will rarely be dissapointed.\\" This movie is pretty much the epitome of that statement. I'd already been familiar with the plotline of this movie before I saw it since I'd read the comic book. I have to admit that I was somewhat dissapointed by what the mystery of the skull was since at the time I didn't think it really fit in with the whole theme of IJ. I still sort of don't think it entirely fits in, but I have to admit that after I had my initial expectations crushed by the comic I was able to actually enjoy the film when I saw it.<br /><br />The movie is honestly pretty good and while it is a bit difficult to see Indy battling Russians (it lacks the zing of the Nazis), Cate Blanchett makes a formidable villain in this film. She is both fun to watch and fun to listen to. The only truly weak points in this film is Shia Lebouff and the romance between Marion and Indy. (Once I got over the shock of the crystal skull mystery, the whole thing wasn't really that bad for an IJ film.) Shia Lebouff's acting ranges from decent to terrible throughout this film and ultimately his best scenes are when he doesn't say anything and lets the more seasoned actors lead him through his scenes. It's painfully obvious that he was hired for his looks more than his actual acting skills.<br /><br />The romance... that honestly was my least favorite part. While I liked the idea of an old flame returning, the whole thing seemed incredibly rushed. Marion's character wasn't introduced until the 2nd half of the film, so there wasn't time for the romantic development that there was in the other films. Try as hard as I could, I just couldn't see the character forgiving IJ for jilting her while she was pregnant (he didn't know that she was, though) within the span of mere hours (in movie time) and falling back in love with him. In fact, the lines IJ spouted seemed more like cheezy pickup lines than heartfelt emotions. The chemistry just wasn't there and it wasn't given enough time to develop.<br /><br />The resulting bond between Mutt & Indy just didn't seem as likely either. He discovers that Indy is his father and almost instantly accepts him after learning that all his life he's been lied to? Lebouff's character never really gets angry at anyone over this, least of all his mother. Granted the three are going through other things in the movie, but I just can't understand why his character wouldn't be angry over this. It's just too easily accepted and dismissed for the sake of moving the plot along.<br /><br />Still, even with these flaws the movie is still enjoyable. Maybe it does pander to our nostalgia, but it's still an enjoyable romp with a fantastic soundtrack. It may not satisfy everyone (not even all of the Indiana Jones fans), but it's sure to satisfy most... as long as you leave your expectations at the door.<br /><br />All in all, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars.t emotions.

B0013FXWU6|2.0|I did not like this movie at all.  It is slow and the musical score is so over-powering that it interferes with the movie.  I cannot imagine why the Oscars cared for it so much.  It was not a pleasant movie experience.  I couldn't wait until it was finally over.

On the other hand, I have friends, especially one, in particular, who was born in Liverpool and refuses to even discuss them....he despises everything about The Beatles.<br />I was given the movie as a gift, so I been and gone and done it and I was blown away, tears and all.

B00005JPUN|2.0|The Invasion (Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2007)<br /><br />News flash: yet another amazing director is imported to Hollywood and crushed by the system. Film at 11.<br /><br />Hirschbiegel, whose previous films Das Experiment and Der Untergang are two of the best films Germany's managed to come up with since the death of F. W. Murnau, took a quick plane ride to Hollywood to direct yet another film version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Because we didn't already have enough. Better yet, they saddled him with a first-time scriptwriter, David Kajganich, who has since gone on to write the screenplay for the next surefire bomb delivered by Joel Schumacher, who in the past fifteen years has stamped himself repeatedly as the worst professional director in America. Even with so many handicaps, Hirschbiegel managed to deliver something the studio didn't like, so they brought in the Wachowski Brothers and James McTeigue (who was a pretty fine assistant director before coming under the Wachowski banner) to reshoot a good deal of the movie. So how much of this can actually be blamed on Oliver Hirschbiegel is subject to debate. And given the quality of his earlier output compared to that of the Wachowski Brothers, I'm very much inclined to give Hirschbiegel the benefit of the doubt, even if he didn't stick an Alan Smithee on the movie.<br /><br />If you've been living in a cave since 1955, the plot: pod people are taking over the planet. Someone (in this case, Nicole Kidman) notices. As the rest of the world is taken over, our fearless heroine has to find some way to combat the invasion. Here, she's helped by her pal Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) and his (very convenient) acquaintance, a researcher named Galeano (Jeffrey Wright), who happens to have an entire army base at his disposal to do research. It's tough to be scared by the pods when the army is working on the problem. Okay, wait a minute. Maybe I should have been much more scared by this movie than I actually was.<br /><br />It doesn't help that I've already seen the movie many times, done by three other directors, but with Hirschbiegel's name stamped on it, I couldn't resist. I only found out about the Wachowski connection later. I would have avoided it, and rightly so, had I known. It's trite and predictable, with not a convincing emotion to be found anywhere. (Kind of telling when the main difference between the good guys and the bad guys is the inability to show emotion.) It's just another useless Hollywood remake; the only difference is they're cannibalizing their own instead of heading to Asia to get source material. **seen the movie many times, done by three other directors, but with Hirschbiegel's name stamped on it, I couldn't resist.

B000YABYLA|3.0|I think all the media stories, Oscar buzz, interviews, and hype set the bar on this movie so high I couldn't help but be disappointed.  When I saw previews and commercials for it, my first thought was \\"they put all the funny clips into those spots\\".  And I wasn't completely wrong.  There were a few other funny scenes, most notably with Allison Janney, but the rest of the movie was kinda slow.<br /><br />After one night of unprotected sex, Juno discovers she's pregnant.  She goes for an abortion, but can't bring herself to go through with it.  She finds an ad in the paper for adoptive parents and decides to give the baby up.  From that point, viewers jump from scene to scene as Juno's pregnancy progresses.  Kids at school stare; she has an ultrasound (a very good scene wherein Janney tells the technician off for being judgmental); she visits the adoptive parents; she hangs out; etc.  Unfortunately, with the notable exception of Juno herself, all the other characters are VERY two-dimensional.  The boyfriend is a bit of a nerd who doesn't have a lot to say.  Juno's best friend is a ditz who's got a crush on a teacher.  And ALL the kids speak with the  stereotypical \\"these are teens, they have their own jargon\\" crap.  At one point I was tempted to start the movie over just so I could count the number of times they say \\"dude.\\"  I know that teens do have a lot of common idioms they use, but this felt like I was watching \\"That 70's Show.\\" (the visual art direction of the film reinforced this as well). I think Juno was supposed to come off as very mature (or wise) in her worldview, but at the same time she had unprotected sex and chose adoptive parents out of the newspaper.  JK Simmons was wasted in his part and could've offered more to the movie as a supportive but disappointed dad.  Same for Allison Janney.  Of course, the perfect couple who wants to adopt is only perfect on paper. I think this was meant to be a source of conflict for the movie, but just didn't measure up.  Viewers are supposed to feel some pity, I think, for the husband who obviously has no common interests with his wife, is being rushed into fatherhood, and never got to pursue his dreams.  All I could do was agree with his wife, \\"grow up.\\"  She wasn't even two-dimensional - successful business woman who wants a baby, that's it.  Since the couple is a such minor piece of the movie, it didn't matter that much.<br /><br />However, the film wasn't all bad.  It had a good message, showing the very real and negative side of teen pregnancy, physical as well as psychological.  And I like how they emphasized how many people are desperate to adopt because they can't have children of their own.  Yet, the film managed to avoid being a moral indictment.  She made a mistake, but dealt with the consequences as best she could.  Juno is a very likeable and spunky character that made this movie better than it would've been.  Ellen Paige deserves kudos for her acting, but the screenplay didn't deserve all those accolades.  There were some very funny scenes and the ending was well done.  Yet, this didn't succeed as a comedy. And, I don't think it succeeded as a look into a teen's life (like [[ASIN:B00013RC2K Thirteen]]).  Overall, I think it would have been better as a made-for-tv movie.  It was worth seeing, but I'm glad I didn't buy it.ewers are supposed to feel some pity, I think, for the husband who obviously has no common interests with his wife, is being rushed into fatherhood, and never got to pursue his dreams.

B000QQFKYE|4.0|Inland Empire (David Lynch, 2006)<br /><br />If a David Lynch movie doesn't have me sitting in the theater muttering \\"WTF?\\" under my breath at least once, it's not doing its job. On the other hand, when I spend more time than not sitting there muttering \\"WTF?\\" under my breath to myself, maybe it's doing its job a bit too well (and people have a tendency to move away from you at times like that. Except the creepy ones. And you really don't want to have anything to do with them).<br /><br />Here's what I've got for you, and I warn you my perception of the plot may be way, way off: Nikki Grace (Laura Dern) and Devon Berk (Justin Theroux) are cast as the lead actors in a remake of a never-finished Polish film that's supposedly cursed. We alternate between scenes of \\"reality\\" (as much as anything can be reality in Hollywoodland), scenes of the production itself, scenes of the original Polish film, and scenes of Nikki Grace losing her grip on reality and seeing the world as if she is Susan Blue, the character she portrays in the film. A Lynchian exploration of the Stanislavsky Method? As time goes on, Lynch ensures that our perceptions of the division between Nikki Grace and Susan Blue are similarly distorted-- though it must be said that there would have been a much sharper dividing line had the \\"reality\\" of the first hour or so of the film felt a lot less unreal. (When your second scene involves a sitcom starring a family of rabbits, \\"unreal\\" is only one of the many, many words that comes to mind.)<br /><br />As is to be expected from any film put out by David Lynch, there's an entire parade of familiar faces, both from earlier Lynch movies (Dern has been a favorite of his for twenty years, while Theroux is a newer acquisition, but has popped up in Lynch's films before) and from the wider world of film (Harry Dean Stanton, Jeremy Irons, Cameron Daddo, Julia Ormond, William H. Macy, and Mary Steenburgen are only a small sampling). In a production like this, ironically, the raft of familiar faces serves to anchor the viewer in reality-- you know these people, you've seen them scores of times over the past few decades. One wonders if Lynch would have been able to cast reality completely to the winds had he used a cast of unknowns.<br /><br />Oddly, this put me in mind of John Carpenter's short Cigarette Burns. I'm not entirely sure why, other than the obsession with filmmaking and the cursed-film-within-a-film conceit. Maybe it's because Norman Reedus and Justin Theroux are always getting mixed up in my head for whatever reason (with Michael J. Fox lurking on the edges like one of those people who doesn't move away from me in theaters). Maybe it's because Carpenter's finally back on his game, at least judging by Cigarette Burns. (Lynch, of course, hasn't been off his game in thirty years.) Whatever. In any case, Inland Empire is a movie you'll need to watch multiple times to get any sense of what's going on, but as with most of David Lynch's films, it's well worth the time you'll spend puzzling it out. I know I'll be putting in another three viewings just to make sure I've got the plot right. *** ½s serves to anchor the viewer in reality-- you know these people, you've seen them scores of times over the past few decades.

B00008976Y|4.0|Blue (Krzystof Kieslowski, 1993)<br /><br />I'm not sure who wrote the cover copy for the Miramax release of Blue, but whoever it was should have lost his job. To describe a Kieslowski film in the terms of a traditional, and derivative, Hollywood mystery is a crime of monstrous proportions. And yet that's exactly what they did.<br /><br />If you have any experience with Kieslowski (and if you don't, I strongly suggest getting your hands on Dekalog immediately, if not sooner), you've got a better idea of what to expect here-- a spare, moving portrait of someone in distress. That someone is Julie Vignon de Courcy (Juliette Binoche), who awakens from a coma after a car accident to find that her husband and daughter were both killed. She flees her old life, setting herself up anonymously in Paris, but pieces of her old life-- including some she didn't know existed-- keep cropping up to stall her flight at every turn.<br /><br />If you've never seen a Kieslowski film, it's very difficult to explain what it is that makes him, as some have said, the best European filmmaker of the twentieth century; it has to do with the attention to detail, the subtleties of his movies, as opposed to the larger constructions of plot, setting, or theme. Granted, he uses all these things masterfully. It would be difficult to focus on a filmmaker's wonderful attention to detail if the movie holding those details up is a travesty (cf. every film M. Night Shyamalan has made since Unbreakable). But whereas some filmmakers are capable of producing wonderful set pieces that one can watch over and over again without remembering much of anything about them-- think, for example, about the cult hit Tremors-- scenes from Kieslowski flicks will haunt you for years after you first see them. A close-up of a face, say. An awkward telephone conversation. Juliette Binoche running her hand along a wall, so lost in thought that she doesn't realize she's drawing blood. (Yes, that's really Juliette Binoche's hand, and her blood.) It's these little things that separate the Kieslowskis of the world from the guys who are almost, but not quite, that good. A Kieslowski film isn't something you simply watch, it's something you experience. ****these little things that separate the Kieslowskis of the world from the guys who are almost, but not quite, that good.

B000WCBPOG|4.0|My favorite track on this compilation is by far Come Together, which is an excellent track when Aerosmith did about a thousand years ago. The entire package is a nice well rounded mix of artists and more artists, each arrangement is a thoughtful, compelling performance that for uplifts the presentation and shines a very good light on the performer that is presenting. If you like the movie and would like to carry some of the memories along with you, then take a listen to this disc.
B0010X745K|2.0|The Mist (Frank Darabont, 2007)<br /><br />Wait, this is Frank Darabont? The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile Frank Darabont? The guy who actually managed to make two of the four half-decent feature-length Stephen King film adaptations in existence (Misery and 'Salem's Lot are the others-- don't you dare bring up The Shining) made... this? To be fair, though, the first hour and change is pretty good. But man, I can't remember the last time a Stephen King adaptation blew the ending so badly. I probably should have known what I was getting into when I saw the cast was led by Thomas Jane, who has a string of awful movies behind this one (including the should-have-been-stillborn King adaptation Dreamcatcher), but I still held out hope. How terribly wrong I was.<br /><br />Jane plays David Drayton, the successful artist who, the morning after a big storm, goes into town with his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) to get some food and supplies to fix the picture window, through which a tree crashed. While they're in the store, a thick mist rolls into town, and brings nasties with it. Drayton and his neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), who aren't entirely fond of each other, are trapped in the store with a number of other refugees, including the demented Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a religious nut who slowly begins to convince the people that the mist is a plague from God, and requires human sacrifice. Some army folks from the top-secret base up the hill, however, might have a different explanation-- if anyone can get them to talk.<br /><br />Like I said, the first hour isn't bad, even if Darabont does break one of the cardinal rules of a good monster movie (don't show the bad guy too much). After that, it goes way, way downhill, turning first into a mindless action movie and then into... I'm not sure I have the words to describe what it becomes next. Imagine the cheapest, most suck-out ending you can think of, and then multiply it by three. I mean, it doesn't even work within the context of the scene that came just before it, for heaven's sake. And King actually liked it? This is the guy who wrote \\"Survivor Type\\"? I weep.<br /><br />Turn it off after the first hour, and it's fine. **of the scene that came just before it, for heaven's sake. And King actually liked it? This is the guy who wrote \\"Survivor Type\\"? I weep.    Turn it off after the first hour, and it's fine. **
0743289692|4.0|I liked this book very much, it provided a very clean look into the inner workings of Islam, and provided a great deal of insight into several other subject areas, for instance what is happening to Europe with the steady influx of refugees as governments collapse and reshape in both Africa and the Middle East. What seemed to really happen with the Somali government and why the situation has not repaired itself to date. This book is fun to read, I could see illustrations of good over evil. How she came about finding herself, and the rift that she had with her father, who was absent for a fair part of her life, her relationship with her mother and her attempts to save her sister from amongst other things, herself. This book is very much about a lady who overcame obstacles, both  internal and external to become herself, an politician and a reasonable human being. She has done good things by writing this book and many of us who are not Muslim would do well to read this.
0140067477|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I thought the guy who told me about it was being funny. He said that a book on Taoism, explained via Winnie the Pooh had changed his life. I laughed, but decided to get it anyways.    This book turned out to be way better than I had imagined. In a way it seems contrary to common sense, but in all the best ways. It challenged me to re-think how I thought of myself and life.    The more I read about Taoism, the more impressed I get with anyone who is able to explain it in an intelligible form. Benjamin Hoff did an amazing job, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone. So much so that I have already bought 3 books for family and friends already.     The best description I have seen of Taosim so far, and all with a cuddly little teddy bear... Um... A manly cuddly little teddy bear *caugh*

B0018CWEYY|5.0|Last night, the season finale of the fourth season of Lost ended.  The fourth season was cut down in size from the 16 episodes that were supposed to have been made from the writer's strike.  I can say that it was hard to top this season.    Lost continues to be the best television show ever to grace television screens.  Twists and turns in every direction.  People who complain about not getting answers should watch the season finale, \\"There's no Place Like Home.\\"    Performances:  Michael Emerson continues to be the best character on the show, reaching his acting peak in,\\"The Shape of Things to Come.\\"  Severel new characters were introduced this season, the standouts being Jeremy Davies as Daniel Faraday, Jeff Fahey as Frank Lapidus, and Kevin Durand as Martin Keamy.  Henry Ian Cusick, Terry O'Quinn, Matthew Fox, Naveen Andrews.  Ther list goes on and on.    Plot: The main plot of this season was the rescue of the Oceanic 6 from the Island.  We learned through flashforwards the things that occured to the Oceanic 6 when they returned to the real world.  This plot is ended by the end of the season, although now they have another mission: return to the Island.  The other plot arc this season was a freighter that supposedly came to rescue the Islanders.  Over time, they learn the true mission of the Freighter people: kill everyone on the Island.    Music: The music continues to be breathtaking.  Michael Giachinno is a genius when it comes to emotional scores.  I have to give a shout out to the \\"Dharmacide\\" piece.  It plays when Ben goes to tell his daughter goodbye in this season's episode, \\"The Shape of Things to Come.\\"  another new theme was introduced in the season finale, it plays when the Oceanic 6 return to the real world and see their family memebers.    Overall, this is one of the greatest seasons of television ever.

B000OV170W|4.0|The weirdest feeling of all is when you are reading a book, you like it and you don't want it to end... Thats the feeling I got while reading Jodi Picault's 'My Sister's Keeper'... Having never read her before, I took up the book based solely on the topic. This is a story about a family with 3 children - one, Jesse, completely ignored because he has no role to play with the crux of the family's crisis, his sister Kate's leukemia which leads to his being entirely 'given up upon'; Kate the subject of the entire book, plagued with all sorts of medical emergencies one hopes no one has to undergo and her sister, Anna who is genetically conceived with the idea of being a great donor match for her sick sister. The poor child is constantly at the hospitals all the time her sister battles for her life... leading her to make one difficult choice - a need for medical emancipation fueled by her sister's desparation to give up the life that she has so fraily clung on to, with Anna's help. While the dad can seem to empathize with his healthier daughter's choices, the mother is torn between feeling sorry for Anna who can afford to help Kate and the latter who is bound to die without it.    The book is narrated from the points of views of everyone involved and makes one see the difficulties of choices and the frames of minds as seen by different characters in the drama. While it is aching to see young Anna take a stand, quite literally against her family, its also difficult to see a mother try to balance the best interests of both her daughters. And just like that, when you thought that you had the story figured out and the end was inevitable, Picault brings in a totally unexpected ending that completely wrenches your heart out. Do I think the ending is completely unnecessary or uncalled for? I actually think its totally anticlimactic and perhaps few would've imagined what it is..    A definite page-turner, I would certainly recommend this book to the adult reader with just a wordof caution - Approach with care.
B000VNMMRA|3.0|Ok, the description on this DVD definitely said it came with a DTS track, and yet there is no track.  I am highly dissapointed and angry.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is a GREAT new bond film, gritty, edge-of-your seat, with a shift of the genre, toward hard, tough stuff, instead of the glitz of the Brosnan films (which I did like, by the way, but this is completely different).  This one is breathing new life into the Bond franchise, and it should live well into the future!
B00005JGAB|4.0|Historically significant? Yeah, I guess.  It did usher in the New Testament era of rock `n' roll (that metaphor goes a surprisingly long way), opening the floodgates for a thousand billion hungry freaks to chew away at the foundation of crusty old geezer rock and express themselves however they damn well pleased. It did make way for the Clash and the Sex Pistols and Black Flag and, aesthetically speaking, R.E.M. and the Replacements and just about every other musical underground (and, often, above ground) movement there is, while simultaneously fulfilling the prophecies of the Stooges and the Velvet Underground and the Monks and the Green Fuz. Yeah, the Ramones' first album is one of rock's greatest touchstones. Elvis and Chuck and Mick, recharged.    But history is for books. I don't mean that disparagingly- it's really fun to read about- I'm just saying that when you're shopping for music, you want something that's fun to, you know, listen to. Something that sounds good, that you can dance to, or relax to, or play air guitar to, or drive to, or make out to, or write to, or whatever other sick things you do when you think that nobody's watching. Ultimately, by that standard, I think that the Ramones' first album deserves only four stars.    Why? Well, here's the thing: It's a lot of fun, but it gets old. Even over the course of its compact running length, the sound gets monotonous. The best songs- \\"Blitzkrieg Bop,\\" \\"Chainsaw,\\" \\"Loudmouth,\\" \\"Listen To My Heart,\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna Go Down To The Basement,\\" by my measure- are blistering classics that I'll be more than willing to blast every day `til I kick the bucket. But after a listen or two, it all starts sounding the freaking same! Same guitar chords, vocal inflection, same feel, same everything. Hating Peter Frampton is cool, but that doesn't net you five stars. Influence or not, future classics like Leave Home and Rocket To Russia were more fun, and therefore they pick up the five star ratings. Still, this is an incredibly fun record to listen to, and a great historical artifact for nerds such as myself. Rock out, friends.
B00004X10B|4.0|I bought (and then returned) four bags before staying with this one.  Is it perfect?  Of course not, there's no such perfect camera bag.  Backpack?  Sling?  Rolling?  Shoulder?  I wish there was one that had the benefits of all of these, but it doesn't exist.  The backpack I had been using is wonderful for having both hands free, but it doesn't hold enough and when the \\"Kodak moment\\" came along, I had to wriggle out of it, put it on the ground (regardless of how messy the ground might be) and then zip it open to get the camera out.  Whoops - my subject was gone.  The 5612 is heavy when full of my gear, but I don't have to leave anything out and I can get my camera out quickly when I need it.  Like all Tamrac products, it's made of strong materials and can take a beating.

0142410373|5.0|Wonderfully written of a child, Matilda, who is a ferocious reader with special ability and great human perceptions. It may inspire children to read more, imagine and discover the treasures of what books can offer. Happens to be a favourite of my 3 and 5 year old daughters.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Delighted that the movie kept up the quality of the TV show. Joss Whedon is a genius, and the ideas were great as were the effects, the costumes, the music, the videography. But for me the most important part of drama of any sort is how the players work together, 'ensemble'. The Firefly/Serenity cast are magical, the chemistry of the troupe is just remarkable. My favorite scene is the one where River dances with the Reivers. I got a real kick out of Mal's learning that although he had been flying with the hottest pilot in the 'Verse, now he'd be flying with the hottest pilot in the 'Verse.
B00004RFFS|4.0|This was a great movie but it's missing a lot of key elements from the book. It's been a while since I've read the book so one of the only things I can remember is that when Lestat turns Louis in the movie it was Fast and on the docks. In the book Louis was dying from some sort of sickness. Lestat showed up in his room and asked \\"I can make it all go away.\\" Lestat planned it out because he watched Louis and knew that he'd have a safe place to stay during the night if he turned Louis into a creature of the night. One other was when they got the Nanny in the movie she died within 1 or 2 nights. In the book it was like 1 or 2 weeks. All in all it's a good movie. But it lacks the intense story of the book.

B000VNMMR0|2.0|There are certain movies in Hollywood where the self-consciousness is so obvious, you can practically see what's going on in the filmmakers' heads.  \\"We'll talk about terrorism, but we'll put an Arabic-looking guy in command, just so the 9-11 watchdogs don't get us.

Reality should be left at home as injured men jump out of speeding cars onto concrete pavements before limping off for 24 more hours of punishment.  Angles switch at a jarring pace between every 3-4 seconds, though Bruce Willis is among the lucky few who actually gets more handsome as he ages.<br /><br />I was actually quite entertained, finding I was able to suspend my anticipation of what may happen next.

I know I wouldn't.<br /><br />All I'm saying is, if you're going to to through all that trouble to create a pretty rainbow across the cast, why rain on the parade by not going a few more little steps?<br /><br />So after that, I found it took increasing effort to suspend my imagination, implicitly knowing the movie was going to follow a stringent script that will grovel to appease the expectations of old men who frequent Thailand for you know...computer programmers.

1878424114|5.0|I have to admit. I read this book many years ago and just didn't get it... it simply didn't resonate with me at the time. About 2 weeks ago I was looking for something to read before bedtime and for some reason, this book seemed to jump off of my bookshelf... so I figured I'd give it a second chance.<br /><br />Now I'm guessing that you've probably heard the saying that when the student is ready, the teacher will appear... holy cow... this was my experience with this book! This time around, I got it... big time! I found myself studying it like a manual for my life. Consciously focusing on one of the spiritual laws each day of the week... as the author suggests at the end of the book.<br /><br />So without spoiling the book for you by revealing all that I've gotten and continue to get from it, let me just highly suggest that you pick this book up and give it a shot. And if it doesn't resonate with you yet, that's okay... just continue on your path to enlightenment and who knows, maybe somewhere down the road you'll pick it up again and it will impact you like it has me.
0743298039|4.0|This book has some positive virtues but also some flaws. On the plus side, the writing is often quite beautiful.

Of course, it is totally unrealistic and melodramatic but that's part of the charm.<br /><br />The big flaw I think lies in the plot \\"surprises\\" the author unveils from time to time, especially toward the end. Each one takes us another steps away from reality. They become a little like cheap conjuring tricks.

B0016B6ZKG|1.0|When I found out Donna was releasing a new album, I was beside myself; I don't know anyone personally that loves her talent more than I.  I believe I have nearly every album she produced, or close to it.  I received the cd May 20th, inserted it in my car cd and could not wait to hear the incredible voice once again.    Alack alas, I was so disappointed..............hated every track.........Donna still has the incredible voice, but the selected songs suck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I played the cd through three times,,,,,,,,,,still hated every track............ended up throwing it in the recycle bin..............still love Donna,,,,,,,,,,just hate this album...........

B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I listened to my first Donna Summer Album in 1975.  It's been quite a ride.  With \\"Crayons\\" one has to admit that Donna is back.  This album has done for Ms. Summer what \\"Believe\\" did for Cher.  It is not a re-hash of seventies disco, but a current and contemporary collection of great songs and superb delivery.  None of her original talent or energy has diminished.  In a phrase...She still got it!
B0000025DT|5.0|Listened to the LP over and over again as a kid. Definitely one of my favorite records at the time. It sounds just as good now and I feel unfortunate to have been missing out.  I have no idea what happened to my original but I don't have anything to play it with anyway.  I've purchased some of the other ELO CD's but haven't yet listened to them. I also owned \\"Out of the Blue\\" back then and again now, but alas it is just OK in my opinion, not nearly as good as \\"A New World Record\\". Jeff Lynne really is a talent, and I believe this was his best effort.

B000000993|5.0|Undertow begs for the listener to see, hear and especially FEEL what it is all about. From the lyrics, art and the music itself you receive an explaination on what Tool thinks about life, isolation, love disguised as sex, sex disguised as an oulet to understanding oneself, politics and disorder.        In the begining of the album you hear what sounds like someone hitting a bong (hookah for our eastern friends) ironic huh, the first track is intolerance and you hear that sound when in actuality it is a scuba divers lungs filling up with water and suffocating. But I digress eveyone has an opinion on Tools music and regardless if I agree with what people think or not opinions are useful. I happen to have a tatoo of the minds eylet from aenema on my forarm... and I could go on and on about how it represents a minds eye and not a \\"regular\\" eye.       That's the thing about Tool you think you know what your getting from them and they surpass expectations in a vast majority.

While other novels I have read have been great, this one was phenominal.  Not only is it a great crime story, but it is glimpse of a world that I never new before.  Stalinist Russia.  Wow.  I am not going to give away any of the details, I just want to tell everyone about this book, so the aurthor, who is a young writer, can keep writing.  I want to read more by this guy.  I encourage all to read this book and tell their friends to read this book, and have them tell their friends, etc.  Enjoy.... you will not be dissappointed.
1416563156|2.0|This book is pure movie tie-in... nothing more, nothing less. The book doesn't stick to just drawings made during different Indy adventures... oh no. It has incongruous images of items Indy has come across (like the Shankara Stone fabric) which kinda throws off the whole look. Maybe if the publisher had incorporated this ephemera in actial pieces it might have worked better.<br /><br />Unless you're a real hard-core fan I wouldn't spend this kind of money on this book. At least if the publisher had left blank space it might have done duty as a personal journal.
0307387151|5.0|I have more or less stopped reading modern fiction, but my wife pushed this one with the argument that I'd appreciate the section on Dunkirk. Come to find out, I thought that was the weakest part of the book--amusing, but not terribly convincing. But Briony Tallis! She is one of the great female characters in all fiction, right up there with Natasha Rostov. (And almost as dangerous.)    Read it. Good book. And if you don't enjoy it, at least go and rent the DVD, because the movie's pretty good as well. - CDB

0061245097|5.0|I have to say upon first opening this book my favorit feature for about 30 mins was just being able to look at Bones. Ah! Probably one of my all-time favorite heroes. Very jealous of Cat. The only tiny little thing that annoys me about her would have to be how little she trusts Bones-after he fully commits himself and his life to her over and over again, not to mention his major sexiness!-but I got over that through the course of the novel. Also Cat's new career, and relationships with her colleagues are throughouly explored, closed and changed; never a dull moment. Yes, the sex is still explicit, but it fits nicely.  Obviously, from above, you know that Bones returns, but Cat has truly grown up now. Yes there is still some kinks-world's largest understatement-to be worked out with her mom, but the book never slows.  Jeaniene Frost has once again created a romantic and action thriller worth buying with only 1 chapter read in Hastings, like myself. I cannot wait for At Grave's End to come out; and don't let the title worry you, there are at least 2 more books after that. Cat and Bones won't be gone anytime soon!

0452289963|5.0|Whether it accomplishes its purpose or not, this is an exceedingly rare book. By attempting to operate in that very narrow clearing in the \\"untapped\\" region of human awareness -- that sliver of mental space between spirituality and religion, between perception an interpretation, between symbolization and pure unassisted and unadulterated consciousness, between ego identification and the essence of universal wholeness, the author sets the bar of understanding and for accomplishing any demonstrable goals, very high indeed.<br /><br />The purpose of the book is to show humans how to use personal awareness to rise above the dysfunctions of ego, or, as the author puts its so elegantly: \\"to escape the gravitational pull of materialism and rise above identification [and] with form that keeps the ego in place.\\" This is a noble and a worthy goal indeed.<br /><br />The culprit of all known worldly evil of course, according to the author's thesis, it seems, is all ego related attachments and the form (or psychic structure) that carries them: that is, the culprit is personal ego-identification per se. Following this line of thought to its logical conclusion implies that universal remediation takes place in the very act of stripping away this injurious layer from consciousness. This act of remediation alone, also sweeps away with it all of the moral and psychological baggage that has been the cause of the individual's -- and by extension -- the world's miseries, since time immemorial.<br /><br />It is an exceedingly seductive meta-hypothesis, but certainly not without a few obvious flaws of its own.<br /><br />First and foremost, it neglects to factor into account that the mind and the consciousness that we have, the very fear and greed-based one that we have come pre-equipped with, has evolved out of existential necessity in tandem with the brain architecture and as an accompaniment to survival. In short, the mind that we have is little more than a response to the kind of worldwe have found, or have created, and not the other way around. The number of degrees of freedom that we have to play around with is very limited indeed. In fact, arguably, it makes little evolutionary sense to create a \\"new consciousness\\" on the spot, out of whole cloth, as it were, without an accompanying change in brain architecture that will support it, and that is also summoned up by survival needs.<br /><br />The author's thought: that it can be done on the spur of the moment, with incredible and earth-shaking positive results is a novel one, but one very much out of sync with any reality with which our human species is familiar.<br /><br />Second, and as the author notes, throughout history (and throughout this book), there are no societal elements, except a few cults of the \\"enlightened few,\\" who are prepared to accept this new outlook and mental worldview. And in cases where it has been grafted onto a few societal elements, that is to say, a few cults here and there, the result has been that those cults themselves have simply replicated on a smaller scale the same paranoia that exists in the larger society: To wit, becoming insular, scared, often perverse and defensive enclaves, having little or no impact on the course of the societies they are a part of, or on the course of history. Jesus, and Bhudda, of course may be the single exceptions that prove the rule. However, we still do not know the \\"ins\\" and \\"outs\\" of their respective cult lives. For instance, the Bhudda's history is shrouded in mythology, and we still do not know whether Jesus was an \\"Essenes,\\" a \\"Zealot,\\" or something else? The history of how they each came to their respective enlightenment remains obscured in heavily censored religious mythology.<br /><br />Third, and perhaps less weighty is the fact that identification per se, the \\"I\\" and the \\"ego\\" are neutral instrumentalities, peculiar to how our own brain architecture and to the way our species assigns representations to specific aspectsof its reality. There is nothing inherently evil about ego identification, per se. Having the \\"I\\" as an anchor for our being is mostly an artifact of how our mental world was constructed and has come into being. It is a necessary prop for understanding complicated mental phenomena that in any case must have alternative representations. For instance, it is quite obvious that the author's use of the term \\"essences\\" is little more than an attempt to get around this requirement and fill the gap left by the term \\"I.\\"<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, the author has forgotten about reality testing. Just as lower animals use their instincts to reality test their environment, so too do humans. Reality testing remains the primary job of our creativity, and of our greed and defensiveness: all animals, whether evolved or not are just trying to make the world safe for themselves, fear and greed are necessary byproducts.<br /><br />Navigating around this axiom of nature as this book tries to do is exceedingly difficult. But five stars for an interesting and challenging intellectual ride.
B00005RIKI|5.0|I'm southern and this music speaks to my soul, always has. I grew up on this stuff. I love these boys and I miss them terribly. I still LOVE Gary and Billy, who are with the new \\"Skynyrd\\", but I don't think anyone would disagree that we lost the real Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1977.  \\"Pronounced\\" is their first album and it has that feel from the road, playing gigs all over the country, driving miles and miles. You can hear that they live what they play.   I hope you will buy this album, kick back with a beer (or a coke a cola), turn it up loud and get to know these extrordinary musicians.  I love RVZ 4ever!!!!
B0000C9JFO|1.0|This is an Audrey Tautou film, not a Marion Cotillard film.  Cotillard is not listed in the full cast list.  Could someone explain?
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I've heard about this movie for quite a few years and never decided to watch it until now becuase i heard so much hype about it, all i knew was it was about \\"drug abuse\\". Well the movie is about 4 people, everything seems fine at the beginning and the movie is slow to start but a half hour later it starts to pick up pace, thier drug use turns into drug abuse and obsession, thier dreams take a turn for the worse when it gets out of control and the movie gets darker and darker as it progresses.    the movie is filmed very well as the director does an amazing job, the performences are amazing especially from Ellen Burstyn which i rememeber from the exorcist and i havent watched much of jennifer Connelly's work apart from dark water which was an ok horror film but here she is also great. when the whole movie ended i was left out of breath and in shock!, the ending was pretty messed up and sad but i wasnt that depressed from watching it but i guess everyone's different, if your squeamish i suggest watching it with someone else because it definatly deserves at least one viewing and it is definatly one of those movies you will never forget. put the dvd in and get ready for a shocking/breathtaking ride.
0446677450|5.0|This book is amazing. I would recommend this to any at any age. I read this in High School and it changed my life. I now own a successful startup company and it is all thanks to the rich dad series for inspiring me to NOT GET A JOB! I recently bought this for my 13 year old brother in law as well. It is not a HOW TO but rather a THINK ABOUT how to!
B00004RFCM|4.0|I love Sex & the City.  Recently, I have been reading the original articles from the Observer to see how this show came about.<br /><br />The first season is quite a good translation of ideas from Bushnell's articles into parts of each episode.  The \\"interview\\" portions where people look directly into the camera and comment on the episode's topic is very much like Bushnell's journalistic questioning.<br /><br />Although season one is not my favorite season as a whole, there are so many great episodes and quotes that it is a must have for fans.<br /><br />I find the comedy fresh and inspiring: written by women, for women, and portrayed by women.  It discusses things that were not too common before this show existed on television.  And it broke free of the old television mold for women, no longer is it a virgin v. slut conflict, it is a story about real complex women that seem to inhabit a fantasy world of shoes, cocktails, and fast lives.<br /><br />But remember, above all things, it is a show meant for entertainment.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I love this movie!! I also bought the 2 CD soundtrack. The cast does a great job of acting and singing. I've had the songs from the movie dancing in my head since I purchased my first copy in February. I also bought a copy for my sister who lives in another state because I wanted her to see it. AAAAA+++++!
B000784WMW|5.0|I've seen many different adaptations of this book, but I feel this one is the best, by far.  It captures the true feelings of the book, from the depths of despair to the heights of joy and passion.  A must see.
B0015AARJI|4.0|If you've owned either a Playstation or PS2 you are already familiar with the Dualshock 3. The design is basically the same as the Dualshock and Dualshock 2, except it is wireless and has the much maligned SixAxis tilt feature. It also feels a bit lighter. There is nothing revolutionary here as some reviews suggests, but that is okay, the Dualshock has been probably one of the most reliable controllers in console history.     I give it four stars for two reasons: The Dualshock 3 should've been available at launch and bundled with every Playstation 3, instead Sony tried to cheap out and saddled everyone with the dog that was the SixAxis. The second reason is that while the Dualshock design is \\"OK\\", it could be better. Compared to the Xbox 360 controller the Ergonomics are behind the times.    Still a good controller. Even though you are sort of getting double-dipped on every PS3 owner should have a Dualshock 3
B00005ASGG|5.0|Critically panned on it's release, this John Ford film is now considered a classic.  John Wayne, James Stewart and a really vicious performance by Lee Marvin.  The cornerstone of any western/John Ford collection.

B000O599WG|5.0|A decade after RED RIVER, Wayne and Hawks reteam on this powerhouse western (which Wayne and Hawks remake nearly a decade later with EL DORADO -- when Leigh Brackett (scripter on both) told Wayne and Hawks it was the same story Wayne responded, \\"It worked once, it'll work again.\\" Dean Martin as the alcoholic \\"Dude\\", Ricky Nelson as fast-draw Colorado and Walter Brennan as \\"Stumpy\\".  Hawks opens the movie without a word of dialogue in the first five minutes.  Note: the man Claude Akins shoots dead in the bar in the beginning is Bing Russell, father of Kurt Russell!  A very young Angie Dickinson, John Russell as Burdette, fun fair for all.  Also constant Wayne co-star Ward Bond.
B0012Q732O|4.0|sure it aint a great movie  but come on  seriously wat did everyone expect?  it was entertaining and i guess it served that purpose well  just ignore the inane lines and cliche storyline  enjoy the effects and action
B0015RB72W|5.0|I found Mercy on Youtube and got sucked into listening to all her songs there.  She has a fantastic voice and the backing music is great.  It's so nice to see a new artist do the kind of music I love.  Especially when she is truly talented.  Her live performances are even better vocally than the album.  Her physical presence on stage isn't great yet, but I am sure that will improve as she gets more experienced.  I think a better comparison would probably be a female version of Joe Cocker.  It's also nice to see someone else with the cute welsh button nose!
B0018CWEZ8|4.0|Lost Season 4 finally gave us some answers as to who gets off the island, and some clues as to what the island is all about.  During the first 3 seasons we learned about each character.  Season 4 ties many of these characters together and develops the characters even further.  This series has been pretty incredible since the 1st season.  Watching Lost gives you the feeling you are watching a full length movie rather than a TV series.  The money spent on the set alone (ie. the airplane wreckage) was more than was spent on many other feature movies.      Lost season 4 leaves you wanting more.  Season 3 was difficult for viewers because it felt sporadic.  There was not a smooth flow week to week and the weekly schedule was affected.  Although there was a writer's strike, Season 4 began and was more consistent week to week.  It is nice that there is finally a plan to end the series with 16 episodes each year trough season 6.  I empathize with another reviewer that it may seem like a rip-off since there are only 16 episodes instead of 24, but I think the episodes are better and there is obviously some inflation over last year  :)      I own the first 3 seasons season 3 on Blu-ray.  I am excited to get this  season 4 on blu-ray as well.  Satellite and Cable TV HD Programming do not do this series justice.  They are only broadcast in 1080i and are compressed smaller so they can fit the data down the pipeline.  This ultimately degrades the picture significantly.  Blu-ray allows the viewer to view this series in 1080p (Through HDMI) and there is a significant difference in the quality of video and sound.  Plus it is much more fun to watch the series without interruptions and ads on the screen.  I am on the reserve list for this series and as a blu-ray lover, I recommend making the switch to blu-ray, especially with your favorite TV Series LOST!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble is the modern-day Sinatra--a smooth, pleasant voice and a good delivery.  I enjoyed the CD very much.

0756404746|5.0|One of the best fantasy novels I've read in a very long time, and I've read quite a few.  Although it is long, I was left wanting more.  The foreshadowing is only slightly irritating.  Overall, a spectacular book.  My only disappointment is that I have to wait for the next one.
0802136834|5.0|If you want to read about Henry VIII's six wives, there are more titles out there that you can ever read.  A lot of the material is a combination of guesses and conjecture, with a slant toward the prurient.  This book, however, is very different.  Alison Weir spent a lot of time looking at primary sources from the Tudor period.  She obviously did her homework, and her fictionalized historical accounts are likely the closest to the truth that we will ever find.<br /><br />Unlike most accounts that paint Henry as a man driven by lust, Ms. Weir paints him as a deeply religious man driven by a combination of duty and fear.  He truly believes that the fate of the Tudor dynasty depends entirely on the appearance of a legitimate son.  Henry had at least one illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy, whose last name is a sly poke at his bastard status.  (FitzRoy = Son of the King, get it?)  As time passed, Henry's sense of duty became magnified and overwhelmed by fear that he would die before a legitimate Tudor prince was born.  His son Edward was sick and weak from the beginning, and it was apparent to Henry that he needed a healthy, strong son to take on the mantle of leadership should Edward die. He himself only became king because of the untimely death of his sickly brother, Arthur. His treatment of his wives was based on these twin factors.<br /><br />Alison Weir takes the dry facts and weaves them into a compelling and interesting narrative, and the tragedy of Henry's relationships with all of the women he encountered becomes stunningly clear.  I found the book impossible to put down, and although I knew the bare bones of what happened from history books, I had to keep reading to see what might happen next. This is a wonderful introduction to Ms. Weir's books, and if you read this one, be sure to have the others in your shopping cart.  You won't want to waste any time getting your hands on them.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Great and economomical product.  Solved our problem with our Volo Stroller.  Room for keys, sunglasses, a bottle, a few little toys and my soft drink. It was easy to install and looks like it came with the stroller.  I would recommend this product.  Seems compatable to any stroller.
037571457X|5.0|Our local community college is using this book as a common book experience for all incoming freshmen.  It's a good choice for three reasons:  1) the subject matter (a young girl's experiences in revolutionary Iran) is timely and meaningful for coming-of-age college freshmen trying \\"to find themselves\\" 2) the graphic novel format is immediately engaging and easy to digest, and 3) the protagonist's story lends itself to myriad thematic explorations.  In all, I was interested in and satisfied with this book.  In fact, I couldn't put it down--I read it in an hour and a half.  Apparently, there's a movie, too.  That's next on my list.
0446679089|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a co-worker, who is coincidentally from New York.  One of New York's finest, John Corey, is convalescing at his uncle's place on Long Island when his two neighbors (who are research biologists) are shot dead.  Corey becomes involved when his friend Max offers him $1 to help with the case.  The book is wordy but the dialogue is crisp and the twisty plot chugs along like a train.  I would definitely seek out this author's other books.

B00164KYS2|2.0|Sex and the City is quite possibly the longest film ever made. Or at least it feels that way, because the creators realize that its astounding popularity amongst its fans transcends the necessity to please all audiences. It is an uber-chick-flick with only a few threads of interest for male viewers unfamiliar with the long-running HBO TV show that spawned this highly anticipated feature adaptation. But it doesn't waste its time trying to appeal in areas it wasn't designed for - it faithfully reunites the personas of the four New York women who constantly struggle with meaningful relationships, surrounded by designer clothes, fluorescent cocktails, colorful characters and occasional nudity.<br /><br />The plot picks up several years after the series ends, detailing how the happy endings each of the stars received managed to last for awhile before all becoming embittered. Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) whimsically narrates as she tries writing yet another book on love - this time not about obtaining it, but what to do with it once found. Her dream man Mr. Big (Chris Noth) buys the two of them a luxuriously paradisaical apartment (and builds her an unimaginably massive closet) and so the two decide it's finally time to tie the knot. But as Carrie gets overly preoccupied with fashioning an extravagant Hollywood wedding, Big begins to feel saturnine about yet another marriage.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the nymphomaniacal Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) realizes she needs more sex and more attention from her Hollywood beau Jerry (Jason Lewis) than he could possibly offer, and so unearths various deleterious vices to satiate her needs. Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) struggles in her relationship with Steve after he admits to cheating on her due to her gradual disinclination with sex. Charlotte York (Kristin Davis) is the only one who doesn't seem affected by the other girls' relationship mishaps, and remains rather uneventfully unscathed within love's good graces.<br /><br />Frequently the film becomes an excuse to show off fashion, which is not far removed from many of the series' episodes. The difference is that the original show more nonchalantly showcased fashion while telling the characters' stories - the repetitious montages in the feature insinuate that we might miss the designer clothes if not for the lengthy Vogue wedding shoot or Carrie's apartment moving session in which she models nearly all of the outfits in her closet. Despite the main foursome's noticeable aging, most of the fashion merely reinforces the idea that if you have a nice body, everything looks good.<br /><br />The plentiful drinks, upscale nightclubs, exotic parties, and beautiful people are still present, but much of the film tries too hard to tack events onto a story that was already satisfactorily resolute. Unlike the show which had a beginning and end to every half-hour episode, the film only has one beginning and one end to a monstrous 148 minute marathon (approximately 5 episodes), which results in the feeling that this isn't several episodes tied together, but one excruciatingly long show.<br /><br />While there is plenty of comedy and risqu&eacute; humor spread throughout, the romance is realistically gritty - this is not the fantasy of Pretty Woman. Love apparently is never easy in New York (although wealth allows for expensive ways to cope with rejection), but friends go a long way to heal the pains of heartache. Perhaps that too is part of the fiction, as this inseparable group goes to dubitable lengths to aid in each other's sorrows.<br /><br />Sex and the City, like so many of the sequels and adaptations to hit the big screen in recent years, proves that certain ideas are destined to make money - and whether or not the continuation of these ideas are beneficial or entertaining for the fans who made them famous in the first place, the thought of making money always triumphs.<br /><br />- Mike Massielm becomes an excuse to show off fashion, which is not far removed from many of the series' episodes.

B0011ZNAIC|4.0|Which is all that really matters! But there are certainly points in the movie that are enjoyable for adults. Overall though, there are better dreamworks movies and pretty much everything from Pixar.
B00001OH7Y|4.0|Eno's out, and bizarre new-wave pop is today's special. The enjoyable failed single \\"Up the Hill Backwards\\" even sounds like something Talking Heads would do sometime around Speaking in Tongues. The record was a pretty big success, spawning three massive singles: the guitar hero title track; the weird, funky, great \\"Space Oddity\\" sequel \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", one of Bowie's most famous songs; and the fantastic, sarcastic disco-rocker \\"Fashion\\" all made large impacts on the charts and the radio and the whatever else. The singles aren't as timeless as something like \\"Jean Genie\\", but they're great period pieces, and Bowie's a creative enough gentleman to keep them from sounding like period caricatures. Besides, \\"Fashion\\" might even be catchier than \\"Golden Years\\", and I haven't been able to get \\"Golden Years\\" out of my head for the past week. Oh, don't forget the ominous, angry \\"Scream Like a Baby\\" or the paranoid fun of \\"Because You're Young\\". But sadly, it's not all that good. There's no way around it: \\"Teenage Wildlife\\" is an inferior rewrite of \\"Heroes\\", and whatever \\"It's No Game\\" is, it isn't good. Plenty weird, but not well-written or anything. I can't really get into the Television cover \\"Kingdom Come\\", either. And it hasn't endured as well as Bowie's best work, good as it may be.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|The whole movie was bad.  I kept thinking we were watching something besides the movie.  The presentation was terrible and the first 20 min. were slow and dull.  It certainly was not scary as, even where the monster bit the girl, didn't look like a real injury.  My daughter gave the DVD to me for Mother's Day.  Boy, was I disappointed in it.  My husband and I both agreed on how bad it was.  I wouldn't even give it one star if I didn't have to.
0393039765|5.0|Having watched the movie before reading the book, I found two things fairly interesting:    1.) The movie is 85% exactly the same as the book. However, the other 15% makes something of a difference.    2.) Already knowing the major plot twist, I was able to better appreciate the foreshadowing throughout the narrative.    If you've neither seen the film nor read the book, I honestly couldn't tell you which to experience first; however, if you've seen the film, don't write the book off as \\"ruined.\\" I still enjoyed it a lot.
0440243661|3.0|I loved many of Lee Child's previous books, but this one just bored me.  The story never took off for me.  I was waiting for the \\"action\\" but it never came.  I would avoid this one, even if you like Lee Child!
