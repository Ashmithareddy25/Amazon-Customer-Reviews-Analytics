6305313687|3.0|I watched the film expecting something powerful and thought provoking but with the exception of some very hard scenes indeed, the story was predictable. It's true that Edward Norton gives a superb performance as a skinhead Nazi admirer and there are some arguments pro and against racism in the US, but the film didn't impress me. I found it too much 2-dimensional, with no adequate depth. I'm afraid that very soon we will see a \\"European History X\\" version, if the confrontation of civilizations continue on its current path.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Was there ever a more gorgeous hunk of guy than Errol in his prime?  Throw in the beauiful Elizabeth Taylor for amazing set dressing.  A good old fashioned adventure with good guys to root for, villians to hiss, and your basic happy ending.  A thoroughly entertaining escapist movie, and suitable for the whole family.  The probably overworked phrase definitely applies here; THEY DON'T MAKE 'EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE.
B000BT97AO|3.0|This movie is, like others have said, visually stunning. The plot is very simple, and yeah, it would have been nice if it was more developed, but it was beautiful to watch. The story is a bit like Alice in Wonderland or Spirited Away (Which by the way is a fantastic film itself) in that the heroine experiences a journey into a kind of dream or spirit world, which provides them a kind of self discovery. The real story is underneath all the creatures and mysterious scenery, and is about the young whiny girl who become a stronger and more confident in herself. An adult. <br /> <br />The one thing I will say, is that if I had seen this movie as a kid, it probably would have scared the pants off me. The imagery can be a little 'scary' and I would not recommend it for children under 10, even though it is a pg13 movie. Othwerise, you may like it. Think of it as watching a comic book come to life. If you like Neil Gaimen's art, you will appreciate the effects.
B0008F113W|5.0|This happens to be one of my favorite releases from 1995 (it's hard to believe it's been 11 years). This packaging to this version is nice, it's been remastered (you can't tell a difference like you can with the Soul of a New Machine remastered version) but this sounds a little better than the original. I'm basing this review and rating on Demanufacture only because I thought Remanufacture was crap, it's FF songs but it wasn't mixed by them, others did it. Anyway this is worth having even if you have the originals.
B00004U2GH|5.0|A great live recording, catches the raw sound but is still developed enough to give that \\"I was there\\" feeling.  Has not only Johnny but also June, The Statler Bros and other.  This is a must have for anyone who grew up listening to the Grand Ole Oprey and the musical shows of Johnny.
B000002KLG|5.0|Well I bought this CD several weeks ago and I just rave to the mountaintop.  \\"What's On Your Mind\\" and \\"Star of the Story\\" has got to be the jamming songs on this record.  I highly recommend buying this for \\"Star...\\" cause it is moving, emotional and stunning from start to finish.  Quincy did a wonderful job in getting Benson to showcase his chops and I think it is a job well done.  Hell, look at the reviews. Did you read them. The people just praise Quincy and Benson up and down from right to left. We don't hear this type of music anymore mainly because things are so visual and corporate. There aren't any young black males out there giving you this type of music. And it is sad indeed.
B000000H3W|5.0|I first heard \\"Dead Embryonic Cells\\" when I saw the video on MTV, when I was in the military. At the time everyone was hailing the brilliance of Metallica's black album. Even though I enjoyed \\"Enter Sandman\\", I felt that Metallica had lost their fire and abandoned the path of producing sweet, crunchy riffs behind. Unfortunately I was right. *sigh* <br /> <br />Upon hearing the adreneline-pumping riffs of Sepultura's \\"Dead Embryonic Cells\\" I immediately sensed that I'd found a successor to the killer riff throne. I quickly purchased \\"Arise\\" and it didn't dissappoint.  <br /> <br />First, my only criticism is that some of the solos are too piercing and played too fast for my taste, but that is the thrash influence on the band (see: early Slayer). <br /> <br />Otherwise, every other aspect of this album is amazing. You will never hear better drumming - particularly double bass drums - than you'll hear on on this album. They are tight, crisp, complex, groovy, and devastating. <br /> <br />The riffs on this album chug, churn, burn, slay, thud, and crush. Remember how we learned about the density of black stars in school? That's how heavy these riffs are. Word to the wanna-be-wise metal guitarists out there: Riffs need not be played at top speed to hit you like a ton of bricks. That's the genius of Sepultura.  <br /> <br />Then there's the lyrics. They don't always rhyme, but you know that Sepultura means everything they say. They're telling it like it is because Brazil was being enslaved by \\"globalization\\" long before it started impacting us here in America. And by globalization I mean the reality of it, not what its promoters would have us believe it is. <br /> <br />In short, if you like Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, etc., this is a recording you must have. And if there's a revolution going on somewhere, this album must be played right alongside Rage Against the Machine's first disc.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The series is absolutely wonderful. I was so hooked i went and bought Serenity the day after I finished watching Firefly. Good features included in the dvd set as well.
B000094HMU|4.0|An excellent early production. Domingo at his young best. Top costuming, and a more than adequate supporting cast, especially Marton. This early production however does lose a little in the sound quality when compared to operas recorded using later technology.
B000301YY8|1.0|You know that something's gone a bit 'Pete Tong' when this 'James Blunt' can sell 2 million records.
156895963X|5.0|This is definately one of my favorite books. Although it can be depressing, there is a lot of heart to all of the stories and a lot of humor as well. I got the large-print version for my grandfather and he said he laughed every time he turned a page. This is a great book for people of all ages: I first read it when I was 14 and my grandfather is 90!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Make no mistake, this is a fantastic collection, of all the number one songs which have all been digitally remastered. <br /> <br />But it fails to do justice against The Beatles' albums, becuase all of them are gems. It is great to hear them in remastered quality, but there is one song that has been butchered. That song is Let it Be. The original one had my favorite Harrison guitar solo, but it was bascially axed on this one. I never really understood why it was done like that, becuase the solo was very impressive. <br /> <br />Another song which has been hampered is perhaps A Hard Day's Night. The most recognizable Beatles' intro, is actually been smoothed out. But I preferred the original intro sound. And the instrumnetal on that song is also lacking, and it just focuses much more on the vocals. <br /> <br />Like I said before this is a great collection, but I'm going to have to suggest getting all of their albums to truly get a sense of how they changed the world of music. This album is only the tip of the iceberg.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Very soothing, incredible voices. It helped that I saw the commercial and watched them perform on PBS. That motivated me to buy this CD. I am normally not a Celtic kinda guy.
0385338082|5.0|Very entertaining -- an \\"easy reader\\".  Very relaxing, funny book.  Great for vacations!  It's similar to Kinsella's other books.
B0002P18GI|2.0|The most amazing thing about this film is that it is called \\"Romantic Comedy\\".  If extreme sexual and emotional repression, along with mediocre intelligence is considered romantic, then there is a point.  Perhaps it makes some smile or laugh, since it's supposed to be a comedy, but probably it's laughter through tears -  the story is the most helpless and pathetic, of a totally passive guy, with no energy, no imagination, with brain ability borderline with a mammal, who is being captured by an extravagant girl full of passions and ambitions.  It is nerve-racking to see how she is trying to wake up his lethargic mind, but his grey matter is indeed so spotless and clean, just as Forrest Gump's, who must be a relative of this imbecilic patient.  Perhaps he had a lobotomy before?  Is love and romance really about poor dialogs, with vocabulary of 20 words, of constant grumpiness and quarreling, hopelessly, miserably?  They reunite, but for what - there cannot be any bright future as they cannot create it.  This is probably the most neurotic and depressing version of a love story I've ever seen,  in a way it's even gruesome in a sense of total emotional disconnect between two lovers,  but I still give it 2 stars for cinematography.
B000E1155E|2.0|After getting into british music over the past couple of years, I've come to love Oasis, coldplay, blur, the verve, kaiser chiefs, but the arctic monkeys arent even close to those guys. I heard that the arctic monkeys had the fastest selling debut album in the UK ever. Thats a lot of hype, and I eagerly waited to get this cd when it came out in the US. I've been listening to it for a couple of days now, and honestly, they are catchy and upbeat, but the songs are just unmemorable. I prefer Franz, the strokes, even the hives over these guys. The songs are too short and sweet. The music is average. The lyrics are good, but the lead singer is weak, and sounds bored singing the songs. Overall, I expected more. This album goes by fast, with no really stand out tracks. Even the ultra hit, \\"I bet you look good on the dancefloor isnt that great. After it was all done, I said to myself, \\"thats it?\\"
0307276902|5.0|I am not an avid reader, but I devoured this book in two weeks (my personal best time).  During lunch one day at work, a colleague had left her copy on the table and I opened to the first page.  That was it - I was hooked. She let me borrow her copy when she was done and I couldn't put it down.  My world had to come to a stop for two hours a day, for the next two week-ends.  James Frey's unique writing style spoke to me and drew me into his life and the story.  I started the book prior to the media uproar.  I wasn't aware it was on a prefered book club list.  I don't care if the events were autobiographical or memories from a haunted mind and life.  This book speaks frankly about the effects of addictions at all levels.  Raw, emotional, depressing, insightful, disturbing, heartwarming, enlightening, hopeful, you name it - it's in there.  I have never, never, NEVER cried while reading a book...until I read \\"A Million Little Pieces\\".   Love, Love, Loved the book.  After reading it I needed to read \\"My Friend Leonard\\" ASAP.  The story contines in that book which is similarly written, again, I couldn't put it down.  I think I'm addicted to James Frey and will connect with my higer power and ask for patience for his next release.  Can't wait for the MOVIE!
0399152717|4.0|Clive Cussler always comes through with an exciting, fast-paced, thriller.  His stories have some basis in fact and they always leave you thinking that this could really be true.
0553801503|3.0|I love Martin and the first 3 books were near perfect.  In fact the blistering pace only seemed to get faster and tension tighter all the way through the series straight through till the end of the 3rd book.  Then here we hit book 4 and its like we ran into a roadblock at mach 3.  I could even handle the occasionally Brienne chapters as minor roadblocks if it ever amounted to anything.   <br /> <br />*SPOILERS* <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it is a tie between Cersei and Brienne on who seems to be the primary focus of the book and lets face it Brienne is boring and nobody likes Cersei.  Now arguably Cersei can still be entertaining at times, but you still never like her. <br /> <br />Jaime pops up here and there, but so what, the guy as lost his edge and is now just a random stooge with apparently nothing meaningful to offer. <br /> <br />Arya the persistent survivor is tooling around Bravosi trying the ignore and forget her previous life, which was infinitely more interesting than the life of a borderline street urchin selling clams. <br /> <br />Sam the Slayer continues to be a pansy even though he's proven himself, oh but he gets laid, so what, he still doesn't know how to man up.  After attacking Dareon I had hopes that he might of finally broken out, but it was a short lived experience. <br /> <br />The ironborn offer some excitment, but honestly after several kings and factions already vying for power, a group of random raiders screwing with the system is just tedious. <br /> <br />I was very interested in the multiple Dorne factions who were rightfully angry about Oberne dying, but the moron running the place has shutdown everyone willing to get some revenge.  Lame, give me a war! <br /> <br />So we have no Jon, no Daenerys, no Catelyn, no Tyrion and no action from the  rest of the lot.  In fact the only people interesting in this book are the secondary characters such as the Tyrells. <br /> <br />end *SPOILERS* <br /> <br />My main problem with the this book is the lack of plot movement.  People can throw around excuses of the book is one of two, the book was split in half, the publishers didn't want a 2000 page book, that's BS!!!!  This travesty is squarely on George RR Martin, he's the one who thought we cared to read this needless detail, about needless characters, and their needless missions in life.  At this point in the series he makes the calls because he is big money and if he is adamant about publishing this stuff for whatever reason, then the editor's can cry all they want and it will fall on deaf ears. <br /> <br />Let's all just hope that Mr. Martin was under some sort of misunderstanding about what the readers really want, because if that's not the case then the only other alternative is that he is selling out and we have another Robert Jordan on our hands (Wheel of Time books 1-6 fantastic, 7-11 mostly crap).
B0006SNK9E|5.0|I've always thought of Sweet as being Capitol Records answer to Elektra/Asylum's Queen.  However, ever since Sweet ditched their bubblegum sound, they became a much more rebellious rock band.  Sadly, this didn't last.  With later albums, such as Level Headed, they fell back into late-70's pop, complete with pseudo-disco and even *gasp* the occasional ballad. <br />But Sweet Fanny Adams (and Desolation Boulevard, for that matter) were the culmination of the best of Sweet.  (I've never heard Give Us A Wink, but I understand that it, too, belongs as one of the best.)  If you're not familiar with the (no pun intended) Sweet sound, start here.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I have heard comments on With Teeth ranging from \\"brilliant\\" to \\"it sucks\\".  A perusal of Amazon reviews shows a similar range of opinions.  But I have a slightly different take from those I've read here: Trent Reznor and I are almost the same age, and I can tell you unequivicolly that the the things you think about when you are 30 are not always the same things you think about when you're 40.  Does the anger go away, as some have suggested?  Heck no; it just gets more refined.  Tempered.  Expressive.<br /><br />Listen to \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" and understand it as a political statement.  Then tell me Reznor's not angry any more.  Like hell he's not; it's just that his anger has become more focused and purposeful. His voice has become softer, but his wit that much sharper.  Instead of the sophomoric, pimply-faced-teenager quality of metaphors like \\"Big Man With a Big Gun\\", we get something more oblique, sophisticated, and cutting.<br /><br />And he has not lost his touch with the more melodic, poignent side of his muse, either, as the brilliant \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" demonstrates.  I actually found it more moving, in its own way, than \\"Hurt\\" - which, while powerful, was still very self-absorbed.  \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" looks outward, at the listener, and it's a welcome new perspective.<br /><br />Perspective: something that comes with age and maturity, and which NIN gains with this CD.
B00006ADFL|5.0|i happened upon this film late one night, on bravo or Fx, some channel like that. i wasn't planning on staying up or watching it, but i found myself constantly pulled back to this film that i had  no idea what the title was.  i just felt myself sucked into it. so i gave up and watched the rest of it.  i have never been so spellbound, and not in a happy pastoral way, but nonetheless hypnotized, by a film as i was with this. <br />  the actresses are perfect for their roles.  you get a defeinite sense of the altered realities, of being claustraphobially close in the minds of two teenage girls that are a bit 'off' to put it mildly.  graphic, horrifying in its realities...just amazing.  once the film was over, and i caught the end where it said it was a true story and the names, i immediatly had to go to the computer and read everything about this case.  i was horrified by the trip i had just been on... <br />   peter jackson is brilliant.  there's no other way around it.  a friend of mine sat me down to watch dead alive to show me the work of the 'guy who was doing LOTR.' and in all honesty i was a little frightened for LOTR.  but then when i saw this, my fears were instantly calmed and i knew he'd be perfect... <br />   this is a fantastic film.  a masterpiece certainly...
B0002OERI0|1.0|What a crock of **** this is , its meaningless wailing of the sort you guys seem to lap up at present. As a lover of GOOD ROCK MUSIC from the land that invented it. I can honestly say any one from the UK buying this is a fool. Come on, whats your problem ?? <br />sort it out . There are enough of you over there in the US to stop this crap turning up over here. Stick a few more volts through IGGY THE GOD , and maybe we can get another true good rock music album. Train your youth NOW to learn MUSIC before you start producing WILL YOUNGS all over the place .You must revolt, as this is revolting dire rubbish. I have harder rock in my toothpaste!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />UK TED.
0060594888|5.0|I was so grateful to have Jack Canfield's book, The Success Principles, that I often found myself kissing the cover as a spontaneous expression of appreciation.  It is chock full of practical, concrete, and inspiring information about how to make a change in your life.  Of course, Canfield offers more recommendations than any one person would probably use, but that said, you can easily pick and choose which directives make the most sense to you.  I particularly enjoyed his chapter about creating a personal goals book, and now have one which I refer to all the time.  A big read, but ohsoworth it!
B00000JGOJ|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites!!  I happened upon it while channel surfing with a cold.  I couldn't stop watching it!  The cast alone blew me away.  Totally stellar, top notch cast.   <br />The movie is basically about five love stories.  And they all share a common thread via this one family in which the parents are played by Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands.  They have great chemistry together!  You can actually see and feel their 40 yrs. together.  Ellen Burstyn is equally excellent as a mother of a dying son.  The remaining three love stories are built around the three sisters/daughters of Connery and Rowlands characters.  And they are quite unique and at some points just a bit over the top.  But it works. <br />I am reluctant to say any more, except that this movie mainly takes place at night.  And it's all the better for the effect.   <br />Everything about it is beautiful!  The lighting, the way the scenes are shot, etc., just add to a great story with a good, but realistic ending.  So stop reading these reviews and buy this movie!  Because once you see it, you won't be able to order it fast enough!!
B000AY3KN0|4.0|The original KING KONG has great SFX for it day. I love it for its movie historical value.

B00005JO9J|5.0|This DVD set is great! I actually forgot how funny some of the things that happened in the first season were until I watched it again. They have such a chemistry together. I highly recommend this DVD set. I can't believe I have to wait a whole year for Season 2 to be released on video.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|An excellent DVD collection and I am glad to have this complete series in my collection
B00000JNJ1|5.0|What we have here are the standout tracks from one of the better UK bands that graced the world of rock.<br /><br />As a unit the post Steve Marriott Faces were very cohesive in the studio with  a unique recklessness that remained true to the spirit of rebellion while never being sloppy.<br /><br />The gorgeous elegance of the ballads, the primal emotion of the rock and roll,the heartfelt blues were structured in the vein of looseness but always remained solid in their great musicianship..Their sound flowed not like many others..They sounded like musicians at play but great playing is what they created.<br /><br />This CD is one great sampler, one excellent play list of tracks..The Stones comparison is not valid...Rod Stewart, upon leaving Jeff Beck sang with that continuous raspy swagger but not so much as the front man but as a member of the band,Ronnie Woods guitar playing is and was reckless abandon and remains a key element of greatness and was a great fit with his style of play and his persona to the Stones ,Ronnie Lane's voice bass playing and compositions that touch of UK nostalgia casts him into history as one great rock ballader,as the drummer Kenny Jones whose talent was recognized by The Who as he became their drummer after the death of Keith Moon..and the naturally good-time dance hall rock and funky wizardry of keyboardsist Ian McLagan glued the faces as one heck of a great band..The tracks cover their 5 studio albums,their Best Of CD and an unreleased track from 1975 that is unmistakable Faces.<br /><br />The very loose and patchy Coast To Coast Live album is not represented but some great live cuts are found on their box set which is a must as well...
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Reminds me of when I was in my 20's.  It takes me back to a great time in my life when music was pure and raw at the same time.  These guys are great.  I love ALL the songs.  Too bad there aren't a bunch more tunes on this CD.  Thanks for the great music.
B000002P2W|5.0|Considered a modest undertaking after the brilliance of the thematic Who's Next(Lifehouse) Tommy and Quadrophenia, this album came out prior to Keith moon's death when the Who were at odds with their record company,each other,the press ushering in a turning point in these honest songs laden with anger and self analysis none lacking the Who's magic..there is a real intimacy throughout the songs sharing all elements of emotion with a question of what to do next..The historical booklet and notes as the sound are superb and the bonus tracks, 3 live songs... 2 unreleased and 1 released on the box,Thirty Years Of Rock and Roll, are an addition.<br /><br />All The Who remasters are great...
B000AMJDHY|1.0|Look out, folks - the floodgates have been opened.  Whenever there's a sound that catches on with the mass populace, you know what that means ... send in the clones! <br /> <br />Fall Out Boy are not even remotely close to being original, but there's no doubt that due to their combination of sugary pop/punk and verbose self-absorbed lyrics catching on like wildfire, we're going to see many bands also attempt to take that same formula to the bank.  Enter one Panic! At The Disco, a group of teenagers that probably were playing ska or post-grunge just a short time ago. <br /> <br />Pete Wentz of FOB claimed that no major label would take a chance on these guys (Yeah, because they're so hardcore and indie!  Right.), so he signed them to his own label imprint, Decaydance, affiliated with the kiddie pseudo-punk factory known as Fueled By Ramen.  Decaydance, huh?  That proves it - Pete Wentz is obsessed with dancing!  Hey Pete - I heard that the producers of Dancing With The Stars are looking for celebrities to compete on the show's third season - are you in?  Go for it, and do us all a favor - take a break from the music industry for a while, our ears can only take so much of your band's sugary pop junk as well as all the sound-alikes that I'm sure you would sign to your label. <br /> <br />Well, let's give P!ATD some credit - they aren't just Fall Out Boy clones ... why, they also throw in some synths as well.  That's right, showing some Killers influence - the other big commercial sound of the moment!  I'll tell you, these guys prove just how calculated they are by hopping on two popular bandwagons at once!  And the synths never really dominate any of the tracks on this album, never distracting you enough from how much these guys sound like Fall Out Boy - from the singing, the overwrought and cheesy lyrics, and the glossy, overproduced corporate pop/rock sound. <br /> <br />In summary: Perhaps there is reason to panic, because of the influx of generic pop acts like Panic! At The Disco.  Basically, this is the band that former Fall Out Boy fans are listening to for the simple reason that \\"dude, Fall Out Boy used to be, like, so edgy and hardcore before my mom started liking them, but now there's another rad new punk rawk act out there called Panic! At The Disco.  These guys are so indie!  Nobody listens to them but me, because they're on an indie instead of a stupid major label like Island.  Fall Out Boy sold out, man!\\".  Note to this type of fan: Panic! At The Disco's label is receiving some major label funds that you don't know about (probably for distribution), and Fall Out Boy were never \\"indie\\" - they were actually signed to Island before they released an album, and put their first album out on Fueled By Ramen to give them \\"indie cred\\".  I don't see why they were so concerned with that - both of these bands sold out at their very inception by recording such safe, sugary sweet pop/rock.  This is not punk rock, it's just corporate tripe.  Heck, I'll bet the members of both of these bands were huge 'N Sync fans back in the day - that seems to be much more of an influence than any punk rock band I can think of.
B000002UAR|5.0|The only thing to say about Revolver, is that it is a brilliant album.  This album is a great succession to Rubber Soul, it marks the first time a band recorded in the studio for the sole purpose of making an album.  This is definitely recommended, and should be a part of everyone's music collection.
B000301YY8|1.0|...there are few artists out there that have received as much unwarranted hype and mass hysteria as James Blunt. <br /> <br />This guy has blown up around the world - even in the U.S., where most British bands and artists are unjustly ignored.  But Blunt actually cracked the Top Ten and already sold 500,000 copies - you want to know how he did it?  By recording a safe, syrupy, and shallow collection of maudlin soft rock ballads designed for \\"power rotation\\" on all the Adult Contemporary stations in the country.  He basically took the Coldplay formula and simplified it even more - is this what music has come to, where we are exalting ordinary pop pablum such as this? <br /> <br />On his debut album Back To Bedlam, Blunt doesn't so much sing as he does bawl his way throughout the entire album.  Sad and depressing music can be both powerful and moving in the right hands, but in the case of a hack like Blunt, every single song is a long, drawn-out weepfest.  This guy can make winning the lottery and falling in love sound as if they were the most miserable, depressing experiences a person could ever have.  Here's an idea of what Blunt's unintelligible caterwauling sounds like: <br /> <br />\\"WAAAAAAHHHHHH - my girlfriend is leaving me!  WAAAAAAHHHHHH - the school bully took my football away!  WAAAAAAHHHHHH - my parents sent me to bed without my milk and cookies!  LIFE ... IS NOT WORTH LIVING ANYMORE!!!\\"  Awwwwwww, what's poor little Jimmy gonna do?  Don't you worry, you poor baby - all that money coming your way will help you buy a house, some milk and cookies, a football ... and a new girlfriend. <br /> <br />There's easily enough hand-wringing, tearjerking, cry-yourself-to-sleep themes on this album to make this a chick flick lover's dream come true.  But everything here is delivered in such a simplistic, trite and inarticulate manner, that you have to ask yourself what people see in this guy.  Look at the guy, he's got so much going for him between his having the goodlooks of an actor and a label willing to make him a big star at any cost - what does he have to be all sad and despondent about anyway?  He's nothing special at all - get over it. <br /> <br />In summary: Bland, mundane and completely irrelevant, the best use for James Blunt's debut album would be either as a frisbee, a beverage coaster, or a substitute for a box of tissues.  Instead of buying the album, why not donate the money to the owner of the studio that Back To Bedlam was recorded in - I'll bet Blunt cried so much that it flooded the building and caused equipment damage to the tune of thousands of pounds.  Why embrace bland fluff like this when there's much better music coming out of the UK - check out Kasabian, The Music, Gomez, Arctic Monkeys, Art Brut, Nine Black Alps, Elbow, Embrace, Hard-Fi, Bloc Party, etc.  None of these bands have broken the U.S. mainstream yet, but these bands have put out albums that are far more intelligent and interesting than what you'll hear on Back To Bedlam.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Most movies you only need to see once because after that the plot twists grow stale or the jokes grow tired but the great thing about Rent is it holds up in repeated viewings so it's a perfect film to have on dvd.The reason it stands up so well is that it has a great energetic likable cast from sexy newcomer Rosario Dawson to vet Jesse L. Martin who you might only know from Law and Order and the terrific songs.Verging from the thrilling Out Tonight to the emotional powerhouse I'll Cover You the music takes you on a rollercoaster ride of feelings.It doesn't have the visual invention of Moulin Rouge or the razzle dazzle and fancy footwork of Chicago but director Chris Columbus's straightforward approach lets the cast and songs shine.There's a misconception among some people that this is a film about a bunch of people dying from AIDS.True,sevral characters do have the disease but the movie is actually about love and friendship and the power of music to move you which is why Rent despite it's failure at the box office will stand the test of time as one of the best rock musicals of this century.
B000E1155E|4.0|This album is all they say it is, I read all the great reviews before it was released in the US and it's really good. If you like Franz Ferdinand and the like you'll enjoy this album. Great beats and frenetic guitar riffs. Good stuff, very happy with the purchase. Hope they continue making albums.
B000002NJS|4.0|This is  a great music dance cd and Madonna is great.
B0000028SU|5.0|We're approaching 14 years now since this album was released.  I can still remember the day I unwrapped it.  I was a freshman in high school, timidly trying to straddle the line between the various musical factions of the day: R&B and Grunge.  I knew there had to be something better, it just took a \\"Leap of Faith\\" to reach it. <br /> <br />I like to think my musical taste got better.  These days, sorting my iPod by play count yields a pretty eclectic mix: The Shins, The White Stripes, DELTRON3030, Liz Phair, and Marty Robbins are all at or near the top.  And, of course, the entire track list of Lucky Town is right up there with them. <br /> <br />I venture to say that I've listened to this album at least once every month in the last fourteen years, and often many more times.  Every time I do, I'm 15 again, dreaming about a life yet to be lived with the kind of optimism and naivete that we adults take drugs to experience again. <br /> <br />Without gushing on and on about this album, I would like to thank The Boss for this often-overlooked gift.  Four short months ago, my wife and I spent just under three minutes stumbling over each other in front of all our friends and family.  Since the day I first heard it 14 years ago, \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\" was forever linked in my mind with what a marriage should be.  In my mind, no other song has come close to pairing such a plaintive request with such a heartfelt assurance, intertwining them in a way that no one--even the coldest-footed groom--could misunderstand. <br /> <br />Buy this album.  I promise you won't be sorry. <br /> <br />ME.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|I thought the movie was done very well.  Assuming there were really people with such gifts, I can believe that they would experience life in much the same way.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a great SciFi series.  I am a big Joss Whedon fan as well and this series doesn't disappoint.  I am just sorry I didn't watch it when it originally ran on TV.
B000E1155E|5.0|At leat in this case the hype that the NME has done is not without merit. Very good Rock record.
B000002INR|3.0|it's a good album, I love two songs: I remember you and 18 and life.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|If you have never seen the show, this movie will change your life.  If you have seen the show, trust me- you will NOT be disappointed!  Anyone who does not love Jesse L. Martin after viewing this DVD is either dead inside or suffering from severe mental trauma. <br /> <br />Hard as it may be to believe, some numbers work better in the film than they did on stage.  \\"Santa Fe,\\" \\"I'll Cover You,\\" and \\"Tango Maureen\\" are all superior to any of the stage productions I've seen. <br /> <br />The extras alone are worth the price of the set.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Most people would recommend that you view BEFORE SUNRISE first.  Having seen this film first, and then BEFORE SUNRISE, you get a total feeling for the retrospective aspect.  You can totally appreciate this film without having seen the prequel.  You will more than appreciate BEFORE SUNRISE knowing what is going to happen to this lovely and real couple some nine years down the road.  These films are wonderful entertainment for the middle-aged who have let their chances at happiness slip away, and who can only hope for a second chance.
0307276902|4.0|Whether the book be real or fiction, alot of what Mr. Frey stated is the truth of the life of a addict. I was a 7 year Herion addict, then to everything else I could turn too, now I drink..nothing else, trying to struggle with that one too. <br />I am 32 years old with the insides of a 60 year old because of my addictions. <br />The book helped me to reinerate why I quit using, it is a daily struggle and as long as I can know that there are real people out there fighting the same struggles as me, it makes life easier to deal with. <br />I praise James Frey and writing the book. Thanks
B000A59PMO|5.0|My husband and I purchased this set after getting hooked on Season 2 of Veronica Mars.  This first season of Veronica is so good we left a New Years Party to come home and watch 6 episodes in a row -- Happy 2006!  My grandmother who is 84 came to visit and we watched 4 episodes every night she was here.  She loved every minute of it and we loved it even the second time a round.  It is an excellent show and I would recommend it to anyone who likes detective stories with a strong female lead.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|This is the closest to Bob as I've seen from his seeds in a long time. It's not too dancehall or rap but brings respect to both with firey but inspiringly truthful lyrics with true island (JAMAICAN) vibes, riddum, and da patois comming strong fe keep it real reggae. Jr. Gong keep this formula and lead the way for more reggae, dancehall, and rap artists as well!!!
B0000070QS|5.0|With the release of A-ha's first album, 'Hunting High And Low' back in '85 lead vocalist Morten Harket displayed one of the most amazing male voices on the contemporary world scene. While A-ha's popularity remained high in Europe in the years to follow, it was only their first album that made a dent in the American musical consciousness.<br /><br />Morten's obscure solo effort 'Wild Seed' was recorded in Gernamy in '95 and is available only as a very expensive CD import. Containing -12 original tracks- (words by Havard Rem and music by Morten Harket), we discover a very mature, mellow Morten who has seen and done it all while remaining true to his music and to himself.<br /><br />His voice is a little deeper now with a slight, raspy tone emerging now and then. I doubt if he could still hit that high note like he could in the '80's, but he really doesn't need to. If he has lost something in his vocals he more than makes up for it in his heartfelt emotional delivery of each and every song. For Morten there's definitely a life in music to be had after A-ha. I hope he pursues it.<br /><br />My Highest Recommendation!
B000BFH2S2|5.0|This is so good. Packed with Buble's musical sensibility his stage presence and 'as good as being there' videotography I loved every minute. Add the extra's that include him with Chris Botti and his band it's an instant hit.

Smooth song stylist Michael Buble has injected so much fun and feeling into this cd that it has moved into my gotta have on all the time rotation! As a fan of dancing with the stars I was so happy to see him sing for the dancers and judging by the audiences ovation and the dancers looks, it made that great show even greater.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|I did like KoRn alot more in the 90's but then they started getting worse and worse until this album came out. I put it in my CD player and love it. I am currently listening to Souvenir (which is awsome by the way) and I hope more and more people will come to review this album and recognize what it is worth. This album is more than amazing. Right when I gave upon SliPKnoT I thought to myself 'hmm...I wonder how Korn is doing...' and so i listened to this album, loved, it, and then bought it. <br />COME TO YOUR SENSES PEOPLE THIS IS A GRET ALBUM AND DESERVES A CHANCE!
B0000AMRJC|1.0|Everything about this movie is dated: the clothes are dated, the hair is dated, the music is dated, and the dialogue is dated.  Al Pacino screams and screams and screams screams and screams and screams screams and screams and screams screams and screams and screams in this movie.  No subtlety at all.  In this day in age, people are now into watching Quentin Tarantino movies.  See \\"Kill Bill\\" instead.

0060899190|5.0|<br />\\"Hello. My name is Becky and I'm a PostSecret-aholic.\\" <br /> <br />For those of you who haven't yet been initiated into the  voyeuristic pleasure of PostSecret, \\"PostSecret is an ongoing community art project where people mail in their secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard.\\" (As described on the website [...]) Some of the postcards are funny; some are painful; some are angry, or sad, or joyous. I've tried to explain PostSecret to people and it is hard to express what makes it so irresistible. Part of the attraction is simply getting a glimpse into other people's lives. A big part of the draw also is seeing a part of your own life reflected there. Sometimes a person writes in to share their secret and it is also your own, and you know you are not alone. And sometimes you just realize that you don't have it that bad after all. <br /> <br />The PostSecret book contains a broad selection of postcards that have been sent to Frank Warren. Many have been posted on his website in the past and some haven't. I admit I am addicted to checking out the PostSecret website every week. Sometimes I even check back later in the week to re-read the postcards and read the updated comments that people send in about them. The next week when I go back, those postcards are gone and a whole new bunch appears. I welcome the new ones, but sometimes mourn the loss of the ones that have faded into cyber-oblivion. This book preserves some of the postcards permanently, allowing me to go back and reflect on them all over again. While the book couldn't ever replace the website for me, but it is a good companion to it. It provides the essence of PostSecret in a tangible format that makes it easy to share with friends.  <br />

0440214041|4.0|Grisham writes suspense stories, and this one certainly qualifies.  The plot involves a 24-year old girl who figures out a shocking double-murder and as a result is being threatened by Bad Guys.  That certainly does lead to suspense!  Of course, much of what happens in the story is illogical, but that's okay as long as the book works on its own terms.<br /><br />And the book often does work on its own terms.  For example, at one point our Heroine witnesses an explosion.  Shortly thereafter, a person identifying himself as a policeman comes over to her.  But he's not really a policeman!  That's clever, it's imaginative, it's masterful, and it increases the suspense.<br /><br />On the other hand, Grisham simply omits the part where the Heroine figures out who is behind the murders.  That detracts only mildly from the suspense, but it displays quite a bit of laziness on the author's part, and it contributes significantly to the overall shallowness of the entire work.<br /><br />More surprising to me was the mishandling of a typical suspenseful situation.  At one point, Our Heroine thinks she's doing okay.  But she isn't: a Bad Guy is trying to kill her and a Good Guy is trying to save her.  Well, what do most folks do with this sort of situation?  They write about the race between these two people and that adds enormously to the suspense.  Or, they could write about it from the Heroine's point of view, which is almost as good an option.  Grisham, to his discredit, tells about the Heroine and the Bad Guy and omits the Good Guy.  In theory, I guess this could work sometimes, but it sure doesn't in this case.<br /><br />This book is plenty of fun for the two or three hours it takes to read it.  And it makes me wonder just how long Grisham took to write it.
B000065BPB|5.0|The only glitch I had in ordering these headphones is that the first set disappeared in transit -- UPSs fault not Amazon's.  Amazon shipped me a replacement package immediately and refunded my overnight shipping charge.  So far so good!  <br /> <br />The headphones themselves are the best that I have ever used.  They are comfortable and sound great!  I use them when I have to work in our noisy (very!!) server room and drive them with an IPod.  The droning fan noise is almost gone and the sound quality from the IPod is excellent.  I'm not an audiophile, but I feel that the Sennheisers are worth every penny.  I have worn them for 8 hours at a time and the only discomfort I have is my ears get a little sweaty.  Other than that, they are extremely comfortable.
B000E1155E|4.0|Yes, NME ranked The Arctic Monkeys' debut CD as the fifth greatest album EVER MADE. Beating out, among others, The Beatles' \\"Revolver.\\" This is in keeping with the typically hyperbolic English press. However, PLEASE do not let that dissuade you from checking out this band. They play tight, fast, rock songs, tinged with enough punk and reggae flavor to make things interesting.<br /><br />Of course, this is an album for the youth in the UK, and many words, like \\"sommat,\\" will require a Brit-to-American Dictionary for some, but overall, the band sings about having fun with no remorse. They have a swagger not seen in rock since Oasis, but The Arctic Monkeys are far more entertaining.<br /><br />Do as the band themselves suggest, and don't believe the hype. Just listen to them, and take them for the solid rock band they are.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I seen in a long time.  Has alittle of everything!  Ya wanna know how well I like it?  I bought the DVD after seeing it and loaned it out - as so often happens - never got it back.  Had to order another!  I wanted THE NOTEBOOK in my library!
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|I loved the movie and I think it's because I enjoyed the music so much.  I love music that makes you feel and this soundtrack does that for me.
0143036556|5.0|A major exercise in thinking about human activities and the lack of foresight concerning consequences. Scary.
0060899190|5.0|I've been a long time fan of the website and the book doesn't disappoint.  All the postcards are excellent, and it shows the range of human emotions that we all can go through.  I genuinely felt like a better person after looking through this.  It even inspired me to write a post card of my own...
B000ATQYT2|4.0|The movie is as beautiful, funny, clever and emotional as the first time we watched it. The DVD is like watching the original VHS version wich has some intentional softening of the images. It does not appear to have been re-mastered or enhanced. It is flawless throughout with the benefits of digital sound. It is now secure from VHS degredation and will re-surface every XMas.
B0000A118M|5.0|At #47 on Rolling Stone's top 500 rock albums, this is one of those records that everyone simply has to have.  But it is great stuff, and worthy of it's postion.  A bit challenging, not just \\"silly love songs\\", but worth the investment of your time.  The editorial review here sums it up well: \\"A Love Supreme heralded Coltrane's search for spiritual and musical freedom, as expressed through polyrhythms, modalities, and purely vertical forms that seemed strange to some jazz purists, but which captivated more adventurous listeners...\\"
B00001U0DP|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in my 68 years.  Inspiring.
B000059T1E|5.0|With JOHN BARLEYCORN MUST DIE, Traffic put aside their psychedelic style, replacing it with jazz and soul influences, and come up with their most lucid album ever. Their early albums are very good (5 stars apiece except for LAST EXIT, which I've never heard in its entirety), but were a bit druggy-sounding for my tastes being that I don't even drink wine for religious purposes, let alone use drugs or smoke. This album fits my lifestyle much better than some songs on the early albums (the less said about the pro-LSD \\"Medicated Goo\\", the better). All of the songs are great, even the two bonus cuts, althought this CD would have been even better if \\"I Just Want You To Know\\" had been place at the end, instead of in the middle. This CD's jazz/soul feel is broken up, without sounding jarring or disjointed, by the title song, which is an English folk ballad. The running order of this CD is only a minor quibble, as everything here is first-rate. This and THE LOW SPARK OF HIGH-HEELED BOYS are the first Traffic CDs you should buy.

0711986746|4.0|I enjoyed reading the life of Freddie Mercury on the stage and in his personal life.  He was very generous to those who were close to him.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Back in 2000, my high school religion teacher had our class write a paper that we had to base on one of a few movies with religious themes. On his recommendation, I chose to watch \\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" and since then, it has turned into my favorite movie of all time. <br /> <br />I am not usually a big Tim Robbins fan, but he does a fantastic job playing Andy Dufresne, a banker who has to adjust to life in prison after being wrongfully convicted in the deaths of his wife and her lover. In my opinion, his portrayal of Andy is easily his greatest performance to date. The movie also features Morgan Freeman, who may be one of the greatest actors of his generation, as the felon named Red who is serving a life sentence and quickly becomes enamored with Andy and his easy-going, stoic lifestyle. Perhaps the best part of the movie is that they also manage to use Freeman as the narrator, and he has a deep, calming voice that I could listen to all day. He and James Earl Jones are in a tight race for best voice ever (although Kiefer Sutherland is catching up). The supporting characters are also expertly cast and well performed, as the viewer feels the perfect amount of affection or hatred for each of them. <br /> <br />This classic story of (you guessed it) redemption will have you wishing for more time with Red and Andy, despite the fact that Shawshank is a fairly long film to begin with. It has some fantastic quotes (\\"I had to go to prison to be a crook\\") some menacing villains (the warden) and some chilling scenes that are unforgettable. In the end, this is a movie about friendship and loyalty that I think all people should see and are sure to appreciate. It is no coincidence that of the over 700 people to have rated this movie so far, 99% of them have given it 5 stars. Go out and watch it now if you haven't done so already, because \\"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\\" <br />
B00000F169|1.0|This movie is bad on every level. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad storyline (freakin boring).  I love the scifi/horror/comedy medium, but this film is just a straight up bomb.  It's not like, so bad it's funny. It's just, so lame and uneventful that I fell asleep faster that my friend who floated a keg full of NyQuil. I'm telling you, PLEASE, watch ANYTHING else.<br /><br />  From the very first scene you will be able to tell the quality of film that you are getting yourself into,(crap) and it never gets better from there. Froget about the big names like John Carpenter & Dan O'Bannon.  This was a school project of theirs! How many school projects have you ever done that were even remotely interesting? That's right, NONE! There is an alien in the movie, prepared to be scared, oh wait no, prepare to laugh, oh wait no, try neither. The alien is just a beach ball with feet. I'm serious,a beach ball, and our heroic characters are deathly afraid of it. What's worse is that more than a 3rd of the film is dedicated to this inflatable menace. I just can't go on, reliving anymore of this film is bringing back the desire to play russian roulette. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one, you'll thank me.<br /><br />Tom in San Antonio
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is an excellent movie, and I cannot imagine watching it in a shorter version; and I hope no one decides to make an ill-advised sequel.  I still have to watch it again (for the ? time) to catch more of the layered storyline.
0062502182|5.0|I have had a couple friends tell me this was one of their favorite books, so I thought I would give it a try. I really enjoyed it. Simple to read, with an enjoyable story. A reminder of how to live life to the fullest.
0142000655|4.0|This is certainly a great book to read. Very well written. The reader should know going in that it is very consuming, that it takes more than one afternoon to read. If willing to invest a little bit more time in one book, it is well worth it.
B000AWYOGE|3.0|When this movie came out on DVD, I was anxious to see it. After a couple of weeks of always being rented out at my local video store, I finally got my hands on it. The whole movie centers around a woman ( played by Jennifer Connelly ) and her daughter who move to a old, run down apartment because that is all they can afford. Dahlia's soon to be ex-husband is not happy with this idea for it will interfere with his visitations with his daughter. After moving into the building, the roof in the bedroom starts constantly dripping dark water, when faucets are turned on, out comes dark water. At times, this movie can get boring. However, there are some tense, suspenseful moments in the film. We all know that Dahlia's daughter is seeing the ghost of a little girl who once lived and died there. The ending of the film was the best part with us seeing the sacrafice a mother will make for her child. It was quite sad at the end. Overall, not a bad movie to watch. The acting was good and it's worth the money to rent it.
B00009P1O2|5.0|This was an absolutely amazing concert video.  I was reluctant to buy it because sound quality on live concerts is normally pretty disappointing, but that was not the case here at all.  This is the best purchase I've made in a long time!
B0000844M8|5.0|As old of a movie as Born Free is, it will always be a true classic. Based on the true story of Joy and George Adamson and their experiences raising the lioness named Elsa, Born Free is a heartwarming story of unconditional love. When George is called upon to kill a male lion that was known for killing and mauling local people in Kenya, he stumbles across 3 small helpless lion cubs which he brings home. Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers, who play Joy and George Adamson deliver a wonderful performance. Joy and George sucessfully rear these 3 cubs with 2 of them eventually going off to zoos. All 3 cubs were loved and well taken care of but because of Joy's love and fondness  of the 3rd cub she named Elsa, the Adamson's decided to keep Elsa and raise her themselves with the intention of one day teaching her to hunt on her own and eventually releasing her to be free and survive on her own in the wild. We see the love that can be shared between people and yes, even a lioness. There are many touching moments in this film. Being filmed in Africa, we get to see the beauty of the areas that Elsa roamed and shared with the Adamsons. We experience the heartbreak that Joy endured when it was time to set Elsa free to be on her own. Elsa never forgot her adopted parents and visited them often. The Adamson's hard work paid off as Elsa returned to the wild and survived on her own and eventually found a mate and gave birth to 3 cubs of her own. There is a part 2 and 3 to Born Free and they are Living Free and Forever Free. Both are great movies as we follow Elsa's 3 cubs after her death. There are also books written by Joy Adamson with the same titles. This movie will truly touch your heart in many ways. The song Born Free will forever remind me of Elsa and what a special lioness she was along with the Adamsons who succeeded at doing something that no one else had ever done.... raise a lion cub and return it to the wild to survive and thrive on her own. A must have movie that will always remain a Classic in every way.
0307276902|5.0|I started reading the book one day before all the James Frey controversy started.  I read the book anyway and loved it.  I think James Frey is a very talented artist and I will read his books in the future.  Loved it, for a few days this book was my addiction!!

0393327655|1.0|I was ok with what the book had to offer in the beginning, however after a couple of chapters the book became very strange in the thoughts that were being conveyed.  I finished the book and probably won't look at it again. Parts of the book were very disturbing and others were very interesting to say the least.
B00006RJ59|2.0|I think this was one of Dolph's better movies. It does a pretty good job of representing the factions in Angola. It has a solid plot. Red Scorpion does what its supposed to do, which is make Dolph the savior of the people in Angola while showing off his body. Its unrealistic that one man is going to come along and single handedly end a war thats been going on for years (especially in Africa) but thats why its only a movie.  <br /> <br />
B000003S5H|5.0|I think the strength of the album rests very much on the two songs that are sung by Beth Hirsch. Those of us over 40 cannot fail to respond to the subtle 70s feel these evoke. I've listened to the solo material that Beth has released and her voice sounds very unlike what it is here. Seeing how Air have failed to match the quality of 'Moon Safari' in their subsequent releases (except, maybe, for the main theme in 'The Virgin Suicides'), I think it would have been wise of them to collaborate with Beth more often.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is awesome; there is hardly anything else like it. Linkin Park and Green Day are both stupid as hell and have no reason to be listed with this CD.

0312263120|3.0|Since so much has already been stated about this book (and most of it seems pretty darn acurate) I'll make my review brief.If you are not overly concerned with technical accuracies or well-drawn believeable characters but like lots of action than this book is for you! However if you are a tad more discrminating in your taste for techno-thrillers try some of the Douglas Preston or Lincoln Child novels. (Or any other authors who factually research their books.)

B0000CDL93|5.0|I was only in the 7th grade when JFK was shot and I still remember the announcement coming over the intercom lettting us know. I remember my teacher crying and at that time I wasn't really sure what it was really all about. <br />I have seen this movie a few times and still to this day I beleive that there was a coverup. I also have the same questions reguarding how one man could have shot the rifle that day. I also beleive in the \\"One Miracle Bullet\\" theory that there had to be more than one person and or persons doing the shooting.One bullet could not have possible done the damage they say it did. <br />Too many questions and not enough answers and I in my lifetime will not be able to find out exactly all the details of what could have happened that day. Like so many others I think that Oswald was used as a pawn. I also beleive it was made too easy for one gun man to come down to the jail when Oswald was being moved and was able to shoot him without one person stopping the event. All of which was caught on camera for the nation to see. <br />The movie brings up so many issues of events that took place that day and too many minor details that could have saved his life had they been implamented especially after all the warnings being told before he even made the trip to Dallas. <br />   Now that almost if not all of the people involved in this are dead I see no reason why the documents can not be made public. His daughter had to be way too young to remember that day as his son said he never really rememberred his father. True there are still family members of the Kennedy's alive but I am sure that they as well would want to know all that was found that day. To know the truth is what the Nation really wants to know. Which is something I doubt we will ever really find out.
B000AL730O|5.0|It's been a long, long time since I've been captivated by an album as I have been with this one.  It's been a long time since I've found particular tunes playing in my head, drawing me to play the album over and over again.  Songs like \\"Jenny Wren,\\" \\"At the Mercy,\\" \\"Friends to Go,\\" \\"A Certain Softness,\\" \\"This Never Happened Before\\" and \\"Anyway\\" feature beautiful melodies. No one is better at such melodies as Paul.  These are songs that are as good as many that he wrote with the Beatles.  And \\"Fine Line\\" reminds us that this is the guy who wrote \\"Lady Madonna,\\" so he's able to rock, too.    I grew up with the Beatles, but had stopped paying much attention to Paul around the time of \\"Band on the Run.\\"  He was just getting too cute for my taste, and the cuteness became silliness on his next albums, it seems to me.  But reading Bob Spitz's biography of The Beatles made me ask, \\"I wonder what Paul's been up to lately?\\"  \\"Chaos and Creation\\" has led me to discover \\"Flaming Pie,\\" \\"Run Devil Run\\" and \\"Driving Rain.\\"  His work over the past 10 years or so exhibits the depth of a mature man who has encountered tragedy as well as happiness, and who knows what it's like to struggle to keep a joyful perspective.  It's very fine stuff!
0385503954|4.0|When the novel begins with Briony Tallis's writing a play to celebrate the return of her cousin, one might not be able to identify the immediate, or most conspicuous connection to the book's title. She might be all contentedly wrapped up in her musing and bathed in oblivious daydreaming. Propelled from the depth of her ignorance, or innocence some sympathetic readers deem, the 13-years-old witnessed flirtation between her sister Cecilia and Robbie, the son of the charlady. Bearing with an exhilaration to protect her sister, Briony perpetrated a crime that not only changed all their lives but also enmeshed the family into an estrangement fixed in the unchangeable past. This crime is serious enough to qualify for a redemption. <br /> <br />As a result of this misdemeanor, the most affectionate memories of the Tallis were bleached colorless through burning bridges. Briony's perpetration was obviously in the wrong but what about her motive? Once she was finally able to reveal that Robbie was the incarnation of evil and that she could never forgive him his disgusting mind, Briony embarked on this proxy-Pride-and-Prejudice justification to vindicate her view. The Atonement follows the repercussions of her crime through the public upheaval of World War II. The carnage and chaos of war that once seemed distant to her private anguish now compounded the severity of her misconduct. <br /> <br />The Atonement explores the ineluctable consequence of this misconduct prompted by a child's incomplete grasp of adult relationships. In following Briony's secret purge of her wrongdoing, McEwan delivers a story redolent of the nuances of love, guilt, and forgiveness. The unfettered objectivity of the prose provokes one's sympathy with the vulnerability of human heart.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I liked Bill Perez's harshing on the \\"critics.\\"  And I think he has it (mostly) right when he says that you'll be \\"pleasantly hypnotized.\\"<br /><br />I might go a little farther.<br /><br />For some weeks now, I have been hearing \\"Svefn G Englar\\" on the radio.  (Now I know why the DJs here in the US are hesitant to tell me what song just played.)<br /><br />It took me until the song came up at the top of an hour, so that I could check the online playlist without ambiguity.  And then I find that Amazon is providing the song as a free download.  And then I find that they're also offering the title track, \\"Agaetis Byrjun,\\" for free.  Man, I can't even *type* that correctly --  the first A is supposed to have a mark over it, and the second A is supposed to be jammed against the ensuing E.<br /><br />But enough fretting about typography and pronunciation.  I think its kind of cool to have new favorite songs that I can't even mention. Well . . . until now, of course.<br /><br />All right.  Before you read any further, do this:  Go up to the top of this page, click the first search box's down arrow, change it to \\"Music Downloads,\\" type SIGUR ROS into the second box, and click \\"Go.\\"  Even if you're still on dial-up, download these two songs.  Do this now.  You'll get to judge for yourself.<br /><br />Done?  Good.  Aren't these songs cool?<br /><br />OK.  They might not be to your taste.  Initially.  Hear me out.<br /><br />When I first heard music like this, I sniffingly dismissed it as \\"heroin music.\\"  But then I outgrew my intolerance, and just let it wash over me.  And now I find it strangely invigorating.  In fact, I now play it loud.<br /><br />Not only is it the perfect chill music, it also works for drive time tunes, too.<br /><br />With Sigur Ros on, road rage seems almost incomprehensible.  It seems beneath one's dignity.  You listen to music like this, and you think, we might just be on a higher plane.
B000BNI90O|5.0|The \\"Complete Recordings\\" edition of the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack is a true delight for any serious fan of the Lord of the Rings compositions. The cost of ownership, of course, is substantial, and less-committed listeners would do well to buy the  standard-edition sountrack released a few years ago. But for those with the money and the inclination, every piece on this three-CD/one-DVD set is a winner.<br /><br />Having grown accustomed to the standard-edition sountrack, I was surprised to see how many musical themes that I had thought were introduced in the second or third episode of the trilogy were actually present in the first. Musically, the three films are far more integrated than I had originally realized.<br /><br />The set includes additional material created for the extended DVD version of the film, and the packaging is very tasteful and well-done. There is little about the set that begs improvement.
B000BWI9U0|5.0|This is an outstanding album. Every track is well written, and the music is excellent. I would certainly recommend this to any fan of The Strokes, or any fan of punk/rock music, you won't be disappointed. I found myself especially drawn to the track \\"Ask me anything\\". It is hauntingly beautiful and simplistic.
B000301YY8|5.0|\\"You're Beautiful\\" may be getting a bit over-played on the air these days, but this album features quality songs beginning to end.  Highly recommended!
B000002LCX|5.0|My impression is that the Smiths is one of those bands that has fans that love it/them so much that even their \\"worst\\" album is a deep pleasure. I could empathize with someone saying that about Strangeways, but there is still that magic that touches us, that makes us feel there music is more than music to us. I feel this way about R.E.M, up to a point (and I'm sure you know it's a point out of time), Elliott Smith, Radiohead. There are thankfully some recording artists out there who you can depend on never to release total, disappointing crap. The Smiths were one of those artists.
0688170528|5.0|I have read several books by Jodi Picoult.  I have really liked them all. The Pact, however, touched me in a way none of her books have. I couldn't put it down. I felt anger, grief and such a heavy sorrow. I could *feel* this book.  I haven't been touched like this since I read The Dogs of Babel. At any rate, I highly, HIGHLY recommend this book. I don't want to go into much detail as I don't want to give anything away. I am still carrying the emotions brought forward because of this story.  Read it. You will not be disappointed.
0553801503|5.0|George Martins latest book \\"A feast for Crows\\" is superbly entertaining. It allows the readers a chance to linger and listen to the gossip of Martins world. In a way, the writing style reminds me of the more classic fantasy authors like Arthur Machen or James Branch Cabel, who definately were not in a hurry to finish the tale or insert \\"hooks\\" which is so prevelant in much of todays blockbuster fiction writers.<br /><br />I too was a bit irritated at the beginning with the abundance of old and new characters and the assumption that we would remember who they were and there lineage after the years that have lapsed since the last installment.<br /><br />However, once I got my old bearings and recalled the story, I found myself enjoying the ruminatings and recaps. I say, tone it down and give it a chance.
0140177396|5.0|Short enough to be considered a must read for everyone but still a compelling story. Another steinbeck instant classic every bit as good as Cannery Row or The Pearl
0440238609|4.0|As a longtime devotee of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I was eager to read Pullman's books after a review in Tne New Yorker hailed the <br />His Dark Materials trilogy as its successor.  I can see why; Pullman adds the dimension of time travel to his plot; there are the strange beasts, the heroic small people (children in this case, not hobbits or dwarves), and some concerns - child abuse and rotten parenting being the main ones - that were not issues in Tolkien. <br /> <br />But the sweeping philosophical and historical background of Lord of the Rings is just absent in His Dark Materials, and therefore much of the characters' motivations doesn't make sense.  Sure, you've got your \\"good-vs.-evil,\\" but the evil seems arbitrary; Lyra's parents are just not nice people, and there's no backstory that would explain why.  Her mother's blithe murder of children, and possible willingness to do the same to Lyra, doesn't sit well with the indication toward the end of the last book that there was maternal love there after all. <br /> <br />Nope, I think Tolkien has nothing to fear from Philip Pullman.  He's still the King.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Having watched the 1940 Pride and Prejudice (Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier) and BBC's TV version (Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle), it is simply a must for me to see this remake and compare with its predecessors.    In the first 30 minutes, I have to adjust to Keira Knightley's relatively modern face and giggles. She has given such an impressive performance in Bend it Like Beckham and Love Actually that it took time to envisage her in the classic role of Elizabeth. Fortunately, the last hour of the movie saw her adding greater depth to her character, making her and Mr. Darcy a charming couple to watch.    While the 1940 version revealed a more comical side of the story (such as performances of Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine de Bourg) and the BBC version was graced by the beautiful landscape and the handesome Colin Firth, I would say this one is a well balanced remake. Maybe Elizabeth (Knightley)and Darcy(Matthew MacFaydyen) on their own do not steal the scenes. Yet together they look such an attractive couple. A 20-year-old Knightley has made Elizabeth come alive on screen, intelligent and beautiful. MacFaydyen has also portrayed a handsome and vulnerable Mr. Darcy. Jane was convincingly sweet and uncalculating whereas Donald Sutherland, as the father, gave her daughter away in tears of joy.     The superb cinematography, a sense of tension and urgency when Elizabeth discovered how she had wronged Darcy, a quickening of pace made possible by rearranging and rewriting (Alas, a big risk!)of some scenes have all made the movie a delight to watch. Credits must also be given to a more realistic portrayal of the Bennet family. The Bennet sisters' costumes were conspicously plainer than the Bingley's and Darcy's. The extravagant interior design of the grand mansion (Chatsworth) at Pemberly is simply awesome.     As a big fan of the previous versions, to be able to finish the movie and still feel good about it, I would say this movie is a successful remake. Even for fans mesmerized by the other remakes, this movie is worth watching for including new elements which complements nicely to its predecessors.

0060723513|5.0|Actually, this is about the 6th time I have purchased this book. It is a great little book that invites us into the humble and inspiring spirituality of the Aboriginal tribe of Austrailia. There is much food for reflection in an easy read. I keep sharing my copy and each time the person asks if they can give it to someone else and eventually it is gone.... and I buy another for another read.... enjoy, CR
1400043662|5.0|I think Murakami has become the best magic realists of our time.  While not as great as Garcia Marquez when he was at the height of his powers, Murakami is nonetheless fabulous.  His ability to introduce the surreal in ways that feel real is at the heart of his storytelling gift.  He also has a precious ability to guide us into the pain and joys of his primary characters.  Young Kafka is so typical of many, many young people today---lost and looking for context to their lives.  I hope they can go on a search for meaning as rewarding as the one Kafka travels.
1591391105|5.0|I found this book very useful and informative. I used it more as a reference book as I navigated the first few weeks on a new, high profile job in a recently formed department in a growing company. I especially found useful the topics covering five different types of discussion to engage your superiors in during your first 90 days. A great book in my opinion.

0440419514|3.0|I read the trilogy after reading glowing reviews.  The first book lived up to the hype, but from the midpoint of The Subtle Knife through the end of Amber Spyglass I became increasingly disappointed. I finished the trilogy only because I'd already invested so much time, and hoped for improvement.  Pullman is a master of imagery and phrase, but certainly not of plot development.  There seems to be no internal consistency or coherence to the story, and at the end I'm left wondering why they were written:  there is a battle, yes, but for what?  The resolution of the conflict leads the characters back to where they were at the start of the story, with no real change in their lives. I get the impression that Pullman set out to rival Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings and Lewis' Narnia Chronicles.  He fails miserably.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I must say that when I purchased this movie, I was aware of the intense assault scene, but no amount of caution can prepare you for the realism and the horror that you view on the screen. <br /> <br />I give credit to all of the individuals who had a role in making this movie.  But the majority of my praise must go to Ms. Bellucci and her \\"assailant.\\"   <br /> <br />With the dizzying camera work and the passionate acting, I would highly reccommend this movie to anyone who is willing to tough out what has to be the most gut-wrenching scene in any movie I have ever seen.
0446310786|5.0|This book is set in the 1930's when the country was in the Great Depression. This book deals with the intense racism of the time. Good book for required reading in school.
B0002O7XWC|5.0|I know over the years that reviewers always tend to mock this movie and stating that the best part of the movie is the soundtrack. They are correct about a great soundtrack. But the reviewers usually miss one important message this movie portrays. That is the feeling one gets when heading out on a long ride with somebody you want to share the experiences with. If you haven't been on a motorcycle or taken a ride longer than the local pub, you still can't understand what I'm talking about. Leaving all that you know as your daily routine, your family, friends and the daily expectations of others. Then hitting the road with a very distant point as the target. The freedom of the road with all of it's experiences, good or bad, will change your life. It can give it meaning in a form that you could never find taking that minute by minute planned vacation. Watch this movie with the attitude of going along with it, experiencing it all for the first time just like Captain America and Billy do.

B000084T18|5.0|This album was probably one of my favourites of all the ones I own. It is consistent. There was only probably two songs I didn't really listen to, and even they weren't that bad. This was the introduction to 50 Cent, and he did it good, in my opinion. 11 million in sales, I mean, wow. Even though The Massacre didn't come near GRODT, doesn't mean you shouldn't give up on him, this CD is really good. Try giving it a listen.
B000063DHL|5.0|Somewhere in time is one of the best albums of the 80's. In describing this album it is that easily said. For those of you who are interested in Iron Maiden, or this album, just buy it. For those who are already fans but don't own the album, SHAME ON YOU! Just kidding, but really this should be in every Maiden/Metal fan's collection. Every song here is great and this is probably their heaviest or \\"thickest\\" sounding album overall, yet they don't lose any of their great harmony or the incredible style that we expect from them, especially at this point in their career. The only new thing here is that there are some synth guitars and they really add to the sound of this album and make songs such as Somewhere in Time and Alexander the great even better in their epic glory. <br /> <br />I believe I have said enough, one could go on and on about this album, so JUST BUY IT!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Had a pasta party with clams and friends, everyone was raving about Serenity? Then a good friend turned me on to this show when she promised to let me borrow it and then failed to do so for three months. Finally xmas rolls round' and I wished it into gift wrap form from the folks. Since Christmas day I have watched the series sideways and back loving, truly loving the characters and story lines. Jaynestown and the ensuing folk hero song bit, TV magic!  The collection has been away from me for months now, everyone, I MEAN EVERYONE who I lend Firefly to goes bananas and buys the DVD collection and Serenity. FOX what were you thinking? Tsk tsk.
0307276902|4.0|I assume that Oprah Winfrey is an intelligent woman. If that is true, she couldn't have possibly read James Frey's book. As I read it, I knew that so much was fictionalized, exaggerated, and embellished. If Oprah believed everything she read, she needs to get a little street smarts. <br />It's an excellent book, easy read and I highly recommend it. However, in my humble opinion, it's about 85% fiction. Nothing wrong with fiction. Buy it, read it, and enjoy it. But rest assured Oprah never read the book. James Frey's writing style is unique and entertaining.
B00003CXAW|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  The special effects, for the time, were amazing.  The  story is different from almost anything else.  This ranks right up there with classic horror fiction.  Long live King Kong!
B00005JLRT|4.0|While the story tends to feel a bit small, the acting, special effects, and several of the scenes are exciting and original! The movie really feels like a two hour episode from the series, undoubtedly because there was not a huge budget. For me, I count this as one of the decent Star Trek films from the series.<br /><br />The DVD looks and sounds great. Most of the CGI effects of the ships and outer space look outstanding.
014305760X|5.0|I'd never read any of Hornby's books before.  This one is certainly engrossing, entertaining, and thought provoking.   <br /> <br />The initial introduction of the characters is clever, creating a curiosity that makes you want to stay with them and find out more.  The very personal, conversational tone reminded me of overhearing conversations from an adjoining table at a restaurant.  The kind of conversations that you end up tuning in to at the expense of your own dinner companion.  <br /> <br />The situations of each character unfold one by one through personal narrative - in pieces.  Like a puzzle that won't let you go.  The need to pull the pieces together yanks you right into the story.  <br /> <br />The characters are real, vibrant, and full of pathos, if a little absurd at times.  In a real, vibrant, and pathetic way. ;-) <br /> <br />The book explores the meaning of life, under the guise of relentless attacks and glib retorts between the characters.  Each character searches for the meaning in their own life, struggling to find truth, yet fighting to avoid really seeing it too clearly, afraid to face the pain.  <br /> <br />As each character starts to see beneath the denial, they slowly discover that while the truth may be painful, it can also set you free.  The listener/reader may start to see some glimmers of truth and meaning in their own life.  <br /> <br />The characters are wildly different from each other, yet each, it seems, is not hard to identify with.  <br /> <br />It's a great story, well acted in the audio version.  There are some good laughs, some very touching scenes, and a sense in the end that life is just - what it is.  It's the people that are trying to sell you something that keep telling you it has to BIGGER THAN LIFE.
B00005JOFO|4.0|We can't help who we love. It has little to do with gender & everything to do with society's taboos. Especially in the 1960's in the macho, western United States. Some of our political leaders today (dinosaurs really) still live in that time. They should step down from office like they promised in 1994. Anyway, two western guys shepherding high in the mountians alone one summer experience physical love. Guilty, at first, they part & go on to assume tradtional married with children lives. They meet years later & it's obvious the attraction is still strong. What follows is a bittersweet affair spanning many years. Ennis is the silent stoic type, apparently emotional empty & ambivalent if not for Jack. He's alive & willing it seems, to chuck everything & pursue a permenant life with Ennis. It seems that their love is only fully realized with the background of the mountain where they first fell in love. They visit it as often as they can get away from their familes. There they can love without fear or guilt in the vast, quiet beauty of the that place. It ends like a tragic, Shakeperean play. Heath Ledger as Ennis & Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack may never be better than they are in this movie. The real winner is the spectacular beauty of the mountain. This is an Academy Award caliber movie, in small part because of the time we are in now. It's a fashionable topic. Aside from that, it is time well spent.

0375422889|4.0|The second book of Marjane Satrapi's memoir is not quite as riveting as the first (just like teenagers are not as fascinating as children), but it is still excellent reading and a necessary companion to Persepolis I. Satrapi's insight and sensibility on Iran, Europe and the lot of the immigrant - never to be at home anywhere - is remarquable. Like Persepolis I, I could not put it down before I had finished it.

B000B8IA2G|5.0|Anubis has been defeated (again), and a team of scientists flocks to the Antarctica base that was discovered in episodes of Stargate SG1. Daniel Jackson (of course Daniel would be there, since it's the archeological find of the century) and Dr. Elizabeth Weir ((seen in episodes of SG1 as a harried woman being shoved around by the odious Senator Kinsey. This Weir is played by Torri  Higginson of \\"The Englsh Patient\\" fame, not the washed-out blond featured on SG1. IMHO, a great improvement. Higginson plays Dr. Weir as strong, bold, and driven)) scour the base for what they hope will be there: the Stargate coordinates for the famed lost city of the Ancients: Atlantis. <br /> <br />Assissting the exploration team are Dr. Rodney McKay (already seen several times in SG1; no, he hasn't gotten any humbler), played by David Hewlett, who has truly brought McKay to real life instead of being a once-in-a-while guest character on SG1, and Dr. Carson Beckett, played by Paul McGillian, who's really been given the chance to fly in this role, instead of being a bit player in small budget movies. Beckett is the chief medical officer. <br /> <br />McKay and Beckett are sort of the 'Laurel and Hardy' of the team. They play off wonderfully to each other, creating a comic relief pair. Anyhow, in the first episode, at Antarctica base, McKay is hounding Beckett to sit in The Chair ((previously used by Jack O'Neill to release and direct the torpedo-like weapons that ultimately destroyed Anubis' fleet)). Only people who have the 'ATA' ((Ancient Technology Activation)) gene in their DNA can operate the Chair ((O'Neill was practically the first person to be discovered as having the gene)). Beckett has the gene, but he's very reluctant to use or activate Ancient technology. McKay, who'd kill have the gene, doesn't. ((\\"Rodney, I break things like this!\\")) <br /> <br />A few hairy scenes occur, then General Jack O'Neill's helicopter lands at the base, flown by one Major John Sheppard, a protege of O'Neill and brilliantly played by Joe Flanigan. At first, Sheppard is a spacey kinda guy, all grins and quips ((he's a lot more serious later)). Sheppard has no idea that the Stargate Program exists, until he's swept up and given a tour by the enthusiastic Lieutenant Aiden Ford ((Rainbow Sun Francks, and I have to wonder if his parents were hippies or just really weird/mental)). (-apologies to Rainbow if that sounded offensive; it's just that I'm extremely curious about the story behind his name). <br /> <br />In the course of events, Sheppard sits on the edge of The Chair and the device instantly responds to him ((as opposed to Beckett, who is slow to use the gene, and the technology is slow to respond to)), proving that he has the ATA gene, and is swept up by Dr. Weir to be a part of the Atlantis team. ((O'Neill: \\"I thought I told you not to touch anything!\\")). <br /> <br />Of course, it's Jackson that discovers the key to get to Atlantis, and the Atlantis expedition is given the green light to go. Atlantis is dark and silent ((and underwater)), as the team exits the Stargate. <br /> <br />More hairy times, then the Athosians are found, people willing to be allies of the people from Earth. ((I'm being oblique because I don't want to spoil the action for you)). <br /> <br />Teyla Emmagen ((played by the lovely Rachel Luttrell)), the nominal leader of the Athosians, is the one who gives the bad news to Sheppard and the others. Her galaxy is plagued by an  enemy even more terrifying than the Goa'uld or the Replicators: the Wraith. <br /> <br />This series is packed with mystery, adventure, and fast action. What I loved most about the collective DVDs is that they feature two episodes that had \\"cliffhanger\\" endings, and the second episodes to the cliffhangers are included. The episode \\"Thirty-eight Minutes\\" is poignant enough to bring tears to anyone's eyes, while \\"Hide and Seek\\" brings hilarity and bone-chilling fear. <br /> <br />Is this series a spinoff truly worthy to have the word \\"Stargate\\" in its title? <br /> <br />Oooooooh yeeeeeaaaaah.

B0006399FS|1.0|Personaly, I was livid that U2 won five Grammys this year.  Mariah Carey was poised to win ALL 8 awards but she walked away with only three.  How can U2 win 5 Grammys for an album that wasn't even released in 2005?  I'm sorry, but this is robbery.  U2 have cheated their way to the top with an album of mediocre songs like \\"Vertigo,\\" \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own,\\" and the silly \\"A Man and a Woman.\\"  A stupid album for gullible people.  U2 did NOT deserve to win anything at the Grammys!
B000002LMM|5.0|This soundtrack is an interesting addition to any eccetic music collection, even if you are not a Twin Peaks' fanatic. David Lynch has incorporated an innovative and alternative soundtrack to his hit TV show. Fans will love the delicate yet erie sounds that are familiar to them from the show. Music lovers will enjoy the alternative jazz and blues-inspired tracks that are reminiscent of an evening lounge.
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"brokeback Mountain\\" is a love story that reduced me to tears.  It's up for 8 Oscars including Best Picture, and it's getting great reviews everywhere.  Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenthal tear up the screen as two men who start a forbidden romance unbeknownst to their wives.  I think this movie will soon be remembered as a classic.  Ignore those who won't see this movie, for they don't know what they're missing.  \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is great!  I can't wait for the DVD!
0446577383|4.0|It was imaginative and well 'put together'.  Real world characters. He kept you interested.
B000BGH22W|4.0|Being a die-hard fan of John Williams, I was astonished at how much I loved the new score for Goblet of Fire.  The music is well-suited to the characters and events and adds that extra push on our emotions that draws us in to the story.  The themes for Harry's various adventures are perfect, making us tense, laugh, wince, or cry along with him.  The Wyrd Sisters rock songs are a fun bonus; those of us who went to school dances anytime in the past twenty years will suddenly feel like we're back there. <br /> <br />Well done, very well done.
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator is one of the most important films of our time. James Cameron is a genius. I knew it then. And, of course, it's apparent to everyone now. James makes flawless films. Even taking into account the lack of high-tech special effects in the first Terminator compared to the wizardry we have today, you have to realize this is an all time great! This movie never loses it's punch or appeal---even twenty years later! James gives us a gutsy female heroine (Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor) long before they became popular. (Look at ''Charlie's Angels''.) But Cameron writes characters who are REAL. Who doesn't identify with Sarah Connor? The always underrated Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese is as superb as he is darling and appealing. Check out Bill Paxton (who would go on to be featured in and eventually star in more of Cameron's films) in the opening sequence as an unfortunate ''punk'' and his punk friends who meet the Terminator! And wonderful Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as the single minded killing machine. Arnold and James make wonderful movies together. Who doesn't enjoy an Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi flick? As James Cameron has said about Arnold, (not exact quote)-He takes direction very well and can physically and emotionally do exactly as the director envisions. Arnold is just great and just keeps getting better. When I first saw this film, I told friends I thought that was funny when Arnold said ''I'll be back.'' It is a truly captivating line....I was right! That line became Arnold's most famous ''catch phrase''! You cannot miss seeing this movie and no home DVD/Video library should be without it! Yes, this movie is A#1 in my book-----exciting, frightening, riveting, romantic and unforgettable. If you don't love it, you're simply not a sci-fi movie lover. This one is the best of them all.<br /><br />Also Recommended: Alien; Predator;  of course T2-Judgement Day; Time After Time; The Time Machine (original and remake); Soldier
B00005JLT5|5.0|\\"The Pianist\\" is incredibly moving. This movie is historically accurate, and the plot is easy to follow. It shows what it was like for the Jews and those that helped them during the Nazis' reign of terror in Europe. All of the actors are amazing, especially Adrien Brody. A phenomenal soundtrack is the icing on the cake. \\"The Pianist\\" is a a true masterpiece.
B00004RJ74|4.0|Great Movie. One of the Best \\"B\\" movies of the 90s <br /> <br />Great Dvd with many extras. The only bad thing about the dvd transfer is that it's not enhanced for widescreen Tvs, so if you own one, it will not play in widescreen mode. <br /> <br />JPD
B00000K31Q|3.0|Loosely based on the shakespeare play. But really just a teen movie.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I was hooked into watching \\"Veronica Mars\\" on the recommendation of Joss Whedon, creator of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Firefly\\" and the feature film \\"Serenity\\". When someone of Whedon's credentials proclaims that watching \\"Veronica Mars\\" makes him feel like an incompetent hack, it's the sort of thing that makes me sit up and take notice. And while I think Whedon was a bit too hard on himself, he was right about one thing: \\"Veronica Mars\\" is an amazing show.<br /><br />For starters, it has a plot that is rooted in an elegant and satisfying mystery -- which is a good thing, given that this is essentially a mystery series blended with a high school drama. The essential premise is simple -- Veronica is the daughter of a private detective who helps her classmates solve their problems while trying to figure out who killed her best friend. From this straightforward beginning, however, \\"Veronica\\" leads us through a twisting web of secrets and lies in which nothing and no one is ever quite what it seems to be in the beginning.<br /><br />On the way to the season's shocking finale, Veronica makes both friends and enemies with her brash, hit-me-with-your-best-shot approach to the treacherous world of the modern high school, and the often-complicated relationships between her and the other principal members of the cast are what gives this series its emotional impact and deep, abiding charm. Kristen Bell is adorable, sassy and delightfully snarky as Veronica, taking no guff from her classmates but also capable of heart-breaking vulnerability when she lets her guard down. Her voiceover narration runs as a near-constant companion throughout the series, and for all the world it feels like a teenaged, female Philip Marlowe has opened up her head to us, confessing the things that she can say to no one else. When we see the glittering, beautiful, treacherous and deceitful community of Neptune, it is primarily through her cynical, jaded eyes. The rest of the cast is just as strong; of particular note are Enrico Colantoni (\\"Just Shoot Me\\", \\"Galaxy Quest\\") as Veronica's tough, witty and charmingly quirky father; Francis Capra (\\"Pledge of Allegiance\\", \\"A Simple Wish\\") as Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro, the head of a Hispanic motorcycle gang from the poor side of town; and Jason Dohring (\\"Boston Public\\", \\"Once and Again\\") as Logan Echolls, the sarcastic and troubled son of a multimillion-dollar action movie hero. Characters in this series do not fit in to easy categories of \\"hero\\" and \\"villain\\", and these three actors in particular showcase the complex character traits and conflicting motives that are a major highlight of the show.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Veronica Mars\\" to fans of good TV, ages 16 and up. The themes it deals with are often serious, involving violence, racism, adultery and other fare typical of the mystery genre. Its deep and interesting characters should draw in fans of everything from \\"Buffy\\" to \\"The Practice\\" to \\"Everwood\\", while its twisty ongoing story and Mysteries of the Week will satisfy the fans of mysteries and crime procedurals. Much more than \\"just\\" a teen drama, \\"Veronica\\" will capture your heart and draw you deeply into the lives of a group of complex, wounded, and flawed people -- and before the season is done, you will recognize at least a little of the nobility of the human spirit in each of them.t as strong; of particular note are Enrico Colantoni (\\"Just Shoot Me\\", \\"Galaxy Quest\\") as Veronica's tough, witty and charmingly quirky father; Francis Capra (\\"Pledge of Allegiance\\", \\"A Simple Wish\\") as Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro, the head of a Hispanic motorcycle gang from the poor side of town; and Jason Dohring (\\"Boston Public\\", \\"Once and Again\\") as Logan Echolls, the sarcastic and troubled son of a multimillion-dollar action movie hero.

0553579908|5.0|A Clash of Kings is a great sequel to A Game of Thrones.  The story lines are engrossing, pulling you through war, intrigue, and personal struggle.  Highly Recommended.
0393327655|4.0|This book is a non-politically correct attempt to simply call the present world situation as it is. Many will be offended as the author \\"calls out\\" the dominant global faiths, but he backs up what he says with poignant eloquence. This is a definite wake up call that had me thinking for days on end about its central themes. A must read for independent thinkers. (The last part of the book gets a little long-winded)
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Leave it all behind at the door. I expected this to be a quick fix SAW type movie directed by the interesting Eli Roth and what we get is a 21st century rendition of something like \\"Last House on the Left\\" multiplied by \\"I spit on your Grave\\" plus a bit of Hitchcock in the mix and some Jap horror and we got ourselves an impressive movie that was a hell of a lot better than what it should have been. In fact, next to \\"The Descent\\", this is one of the best horrors I have seen in a long long time, another genre reviver and a lot more than just the popcorn fodder that SAW dished up. Memorable scenes include the goofy accountant type sadist, an eye scene, messy heels, a train and some choky vomit. I highly recommend that anyone who has the stomach for it, go watch it, and certainly those who have a taste for the aforementioned type of splatter masterpieces, well what more can we say than Roth knows how to do it right... and with two severed fingers... I mean... a cherry on top. It even had loads of high suspense towards the end. Yeah, I dig this one like I would a grave for an airhead hooker who just got her cap bust for my giggles. This indie movie is all like that kind of sensibility. Not for the masses. Oh the joy!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is an absolutely delightful package! I cannot think of a more appropriate and tasteful way to commemorate George Harrison's great personality and music. Eric Clapton did a wonderful thing in pulling this whole thing off. Great thanks also to Ravi Shankar whose composition is setting the mood for the occasion. If you liked George's 'Concert For Bangladesh', you will love to see and hear many of the performers again, like Billy Preston, Jim Keltner, Klaus Vormann, Ringo Starr... Preston's version of 'My Sweet Lord' might be the definite version of this great song. The Monty Pythons provide the evening with a bit of their irreverent fun. Unfortunately, one of George's musical friends is absent: Bob Dylan, where were you that night?
B00004WLXZ|3.0|I think I can't tell that it's a must see...But still interesting..Especially youth camps, everybody's support, the will of the people...I wonder if any politician can fulfill a stadium today with people all supporting him very eagerly and devoted....That was the most striking point in my opinion
B00003CXIY|5.0|Great DVD.  Very funny I enjoy watching this one over and over
630469654X|5.0|I really haven't watched the movie yet but it is definitely one of my favorites
B00005JNX0|5.0|This movie was great in just about every way. It has enough subtlety to keep an adult interested, combined with enough slapstick fun to keep my 5-1/2 yr. old daughter laughing for most of the movie. We have now watched it about 100 times.
B0000942HV|2.0|Mike Oldfield reaches back to the past to rehash his \\"Bells\\" for the n-th time. When Glenn Gould re-recorded the Goldberg Variations, he breathed so much new soul and new ideas into the new version.  For Oldfield, the Bells have been such a cash cow that he can't let go of milking it. It speaks for the evolution of modern music that with digital precision the spirit of the music vanishes and all you get is perfect sound, polished like a Britney Spears dancedoll without much individuality or meaningful musical contribution.  Had Mike truly revived his Bells with new artistic ideas, it would be different.  Even naming them TB 2003 (like Windows 2000) shows the bad taste in this marketing stint. Empty and disappointing.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Great humor, great irony, great cast.  It gives a good overview of the 60s concern with mass distruction in ways that point out our blind obedance to the preservation of our way even if it means the distruction of everything.
B00003CX8N|4.0|This quiet, early 1900's movie is a sweet story of friendships that are forged over a lifetime through correspondence from one side of the pond to the other built on the love of common things--books.  The sweetness is in the ordinary people and their ordinary lives adding richness and kindness to the places that all of us find ourselves living and working.  It is a case for \\"goodness and kindness matter.\\"
B0008GNJZY|5.0|Coach Carter is an exemplary movie about values and character amid any circumstances.  It shows that with great character and and indomitable will to establish the values that will make us trascend, anything is possible.  Great movie!
0880796863|2.0|This is a defective product by the publisher, otherwise it would rec a 5 of 5 stars.  The publisher repeated pg 145 twice missing pg 147.  Amazon replaced the first order only to receive a second order that was also defective and this is an essential part of the book in interpretating the last four cards.<br /><br />Until the publisher recalls the entire lot and fixes this I would not recommend purchasing the book.
0553573403|5.0|Game of Thrones is a fantastic book.  When I first opened it, there was a map and in the back there was an index with a HUGE list of names of people.  My first thought was \\"Oh no, Ill never be able to keep up.\\" However I was plesantly surprised at how easy it was to follow the story.  George Martin did a fantastic job.  The character developement, the in-depth plot and the twists make this one of the best books I've ever read, if you like Fantasy Novels I highly reccomend this book.
0684824906|5.0|Outstanding work.  Most interesting book on the Lincoln era in many years.  Give me more reasons to lionize Abraham Lincoln.
0790729628|5.0|This is the best SF. movie i ever seen.Watch it,because is worth it.
B0000524CY|5.0|I cannot think of a single movie that is more frightening than the Exorcist! The acting in this movie was simply phenomenal, and the story of an innocent child being taken over by diabolical forces is so unsettling. This version of the film is definitely better than the original, with only one caveat: The ending for the original was better than the one that is in this version. Other than that, the added scenes really give more substance to this film.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I got this DVD set for Xmas and love every second of it. It's great seeing Bono and Paul Mccartney kick off SPLHCB together, and then a great performance by U2 themselves. Velvet Revolver put on a great show and I never lost interest in their performance. And I FINALLY got to watch the magic of the Floyd live. It was the 1st time I've ever seen them live, and I loved every minute of it(and I now hve it on DVD to charish!). It was great watching The Killers, and seeing them play makes me want to go to one of their concerts. The finale with Sir Mccartney and other famous music stars is truly a great performance and one not to be ignored.<br /><br /> The only thing that I don't like about the DVD is that only one song from Green Day's performance was included. American Idiot was great seeing live, but I also wanted to hear Minority and their cover of Queen's We Are The Champions like in the original Live 8. Still, this is a great DVD and belongs in every music lover's collection.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I rented all the episodes of the show after reading about it having such a cult following.  I was impressed with the show.  It was original, funny, corny at times, and it was a different take on Sci Fi, especially by TV standards.  (No aliens, fairly low-tech) <br /> <br />Those who say the movie is just a long episode are essentially correct. But, it's a well funded long episode with a bit more polish than the series. <br /> <br />You don't need to see the series to enjoy the movie, but I would recommend it.  You'll go into the movie already knowing the characters and the setting.
B00004XONN|5.0|A perfect follow-up to Ok Computer Kid A is, it explores more of the crunchy guitars that were somewhat explored on Pablo Honey. Radiohead explored the electronic scene a little on this record, with hints of electronic bands like Autechre and Aphex Twin. This is further explored on Amnesiac(their most underrated). One thing that really caught my attention on Kid A is that-as people have said before-it has some Pink Floyd vibes in it, which are greatly explored on Everything In It's Right Place and How To Dissapear Completely. The electronic vibes are greatly explored on Kid A and Idioteque.<br /><br /> One thing that's really interesting about Kid A is how it seems to be a sort of conceot album. This was somewhat explored on The Bends, more explored on Ok Computer(in my opinion), and GREATLY explored here. The concept is very blurry, and it's hard for me to try and indentify at times, but it just makes me want to listen to the record more and more.<br /><br /> I highly reccomend this to any fan of Pink Floyd, electronic music, and of course, fans of Radiohead. Kid A is an epic rollercoaster of emotions that will take you on it's shakey journey. And make sure you check out Amnesiac, the follow-up to Kid A. It's really underrated, but I think it rocks.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|I liked this movie better than the original Toy Story (which was great too).  Oh, my kids liked it too - ha ha
B000E1YVZU|5.0|One of the best movies [musicals] ever made!!! I received it today and am watching it for the 5th time.  What a shame that it did not receive the attention it deserved with respect to the movie awards.  I've already got the soundtrack which is equally amazing.  A definite must for musical lovers
B000BTGY1O|5.0|\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's is an excellent and entertaining film. Audrey Hepbrun is charming and sophistocated as Holly.   <br />George Peppard is great in it too.  Great costumes, Audrey certainly has a beautiful style about her.  Also the great scenes of New York city and entertaining story line.  I think she sings \\"Moon River\\" beautifully and adds a lot of style and class to it.  It's a film I think people would really enjoy, definitly entertaining.   Also it's wonderful with the documentary parts of the extra features you learn a lot about the film.  Really neat extra features on this. <br />The cat in here is really cute too.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|This DVD is the best concert production of Eric Clapton (and Cream) that will EVER exist. It is a must have for any fan of Cream in the 1960's - 70's.  It has all the great songs they produced along with great interviews with each member on getting back together after 37 years.  The songs are not only better but longer with incredible improvisational qualities. Once seeing and listening to this you will no longer question why many great artists make claim that Eric Clapton is the greatest guitar player ever.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Let's see, Baddest Critic(a/k/a Cranky) is wrong. He said Brian DePalma made no other movies(chuckles). Let's see, DePalma made many movies like The Phantom of the Paradise, the horrror classic Carrie and The Untouchables(which won Sean Connery an Oscar) are all examples. DePalma's most famous movie is Scarface. This movie was ahead of its time and is a great movie to watch. Al Pacino's character Tony Montana is now story of legend and people still recite quotes from this movie moreso than any flavor of the month trash Tarantino made. Watch now or you will be eaten like bird feed.
B000BWI9U0|2.0|their first album was still the best.  This ones seems to have one catchy song and a bunch of filler.  Seemed to be produced just to put something out there
B0006399FS|5.0|This album from U2 is one of my favorites. Songs like Vertigo and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own are awesome. I was happy to see these guys upset Hoeriah Scary. This album, like Pink Floyd's Animals(Baddest Critic, I dare you trash that album which tanked but is great), is a must own. Bono, The Edge, CONGRATS ON GRAMMY SWEEP! Hoeriah lost because she s*cks!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Bought this becausei had watched the series(Firefly) well worth a purchase  <br />Good all round action pic with a good plot you don't need to have seen the series to enjoy characters meld well and the acting is very good WELL WORTH BUYING <br /> <br />Never understood why the series was shelved should be brought back immediatly
B000AM4PBS|5.0|GREAT GREAT ITEM. I WAS LOOKING FOR IT ALL OVER INTERNET, EBAY, AMAZON, OVERSTOCK, EVERYTHING. AND THIS IS THE PLACE TO GET IT RIGHT!!! THANKS AMAZON. AND FAST SHIPMENT.
B000065V3H|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in my younger days and, I enjoyed it then.  I ordered it for my daughter and I find that not only did my daughter enjoy it, but I still enjoy it as well!  It is a very good and amusing story.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I won't go into any details regarding \\"Serenity\\" the movie. All those familiar with the \\"Firefly\\" verse will already be quite familiar with it. Those that aren't really should get acquainted first. <br /> <br />Instead, I'll just focus on the DVD release itself. Seems much more useful to me ^_^ <br /> <br />* AV quality is good. Everything's nice and crisp. <br />* The menus are laid out quite nicely and look good. <br />* There's bunches of extras on the DVD! Well worth your money! <br /> <br />All in all, it's an essential purchase for the Firefly/Serenity fanatic.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If I could give this product six stars I would.  I never watched the show when it was on fox.  I never even saw the movie based on the series until several weeks after it had been on DVD and I got around to picking it up. <br /> <br />This show is quite simply the best show that has ever been on FOX.  This is coming from someone who has been a big fan of Fox programming: 24, The Simpson's and many others have been among my favorites.  I have fond memories of even some of the lesser known Fox shows like: Herman's Head, In Living Color, Get a Life and Sledgehammer.  So when I say that Firefly is the Best Show Fox has ever made, please know from where I'm coming from. <br /> <br />The DVDs have all eleven of the episodes made and aired in the order Joss wanted them seen in.  It makes a lot more sense than the Fox Execs. showing the pilot last.  The DVDs are loaded with extras including several disks with commentary.  I will watch an entire episode with the commentary turned on just to get a better connection with the 'verse.   <br /> <br />The characters are original and well done, humor is everywhere but not to the point where it's \\"campy\\".  The visual effects are stunning and the music (especially in \\"The Message\\") is hauntingly beautiful.   <br /> <br />There is a reason there are so many die hard fans out there.  When you pop in your first DVD and see what Joss Whedon created for us, you'll be as blown away as I was.
0393035158|5.0|If you read nothing but the first chapter, it's a must read for anyone who is concerned about what religion is doing to this world.  Anyone who is not concerned about the effects of religion on this world should especially read this book.  My question is why aren't books like this on the best-seller racks instead of the many mindless ditties currently taking up so much shelf space?  Because people are mostly complacent when it comes to serious issues.  After all, what can WE do?  Here's one thing to start with. Read something a little outside your normal comfy zone.  Read this.  Wake yourself up.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Jack Black is surprisingly good as Carl Denham. Even though he reminds me more of filmmaker/actor legend Orson Wells than original KK's Bob Armstrong I was impressed with his satisfying take of Carl Denham. As for comely Naomi Watts she is effective as Ann Darrow as well. Personally I liked her best when she conveyed more meaning with body language than the spoken word (like in her dialogue-free scenes in the end in NYC). Adrian Brody is not well cast at all as Jack Driscoll (now a playwright rather than first mate as he was in the original to give the new film a more showbiz feel). Brody isn't much of an action hero or that good at romance with Watts ----too bad Bruce Willis wasn't interested in this part.
0307276902|5.0|In spite of the recent negative publicity surrounding the authenticity of the story, it still remained a gripping, can't put it down book.  The insight into the life and thinking of an addict was informational and inspirational whether real or otherwise.
B00002E224|5.0|Although I love movies I own very few DVD's or VCR's. There just aren't that many movies I want to watch enough to make it worth while buying them. But \\"Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset' pass the test - I can watch them again and again. <br /> <br />All the best love stories have a lot of fun and joy in them. Before Sunrise (and Before Sunset) are full of the fun and joy of being in love. Both movies have three characters - Jesse, Celine and the city - Vienna in 'Before Sunrise' and Paris in 'Before Sunset. <br /> <br />Nothing much happens in either movie, so if you like movies with action and plot these may not be for you. Maybe that's why they can be watched many times - because you don't watch for the plot, knowing what happens doesn't spoil the movie.  <br /> <br />If you like great dialog, great acting, and beautiful photography these are movies to own.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I've always loved the movie, but the interview with the grown up kids was especially interesting.  Watch the interviews first and then the movie.  You'll see it through new eyes.  Fun!
B000E1155E|4.0|The jury is still out on whether the Arctic Monkeys are one of the five best bands ever (God save the NME), but their debut album is a solid, engaging offering that heralds good things from the band.    Arctic Monkeys combine the dancey rhythms of Franz Ferdinand with a big dose of hard rock bluster circa early Oasis. The meat-and-potatoes production emphasizes guitar and drums (the keyboard flourishes that characterize other modern postpunk bands are entirely absent), keeping the sound raw and aggressive. Nearly every track features multiple memorable riffs to ensure that they get permanently stuck in your head.    But what really sets the band apart is frontman Alex Turner. His heavily accented rasp and literary lyrical bent strongly recall a young Paul Weller. He's got an eye for telling details and a knack for sketching indelible characters and situations with very few words that serve the band very well. The only shortcoming apparent is Turner's relentless focus on clubbing and scenesters. After several lyrically similar songs in a row early in the album, you start to really wish he'd sing about something else. Thankfully, the album's second half opens up a bit. The record also hurts for the exclusion of \\"Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts,\\" a b-side to \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" and one of the band's very best songs. Subbing it in for one of the lesser tracks like \\"You Probably Couldn't See for the Lights...\\" would have improved the album considerably.    All in all, \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\" is an impressive achievement that puts the Arctic Monkeys alongside such promising new British bands as Maximo Park and Art Brut. Hopefully their sophomore record will be even better!
0743539478|5.0|Great book, I listened to the CD's, it keeps you guessing all thru the book, the plot has twists and turns and every time you think you have it all figured out it changes again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This T.V. series has an interesting, fun and original storyline.  The casting was great.  The person who cancelled the show must be an idiot.

B000AWYOGE|2.0|I should have stayed home that day. Or hell, popped the tires in my damn car for that matter. But no. Something gave me an urge to go to Best Buy. Something made me go to the horror section. I was actually looking for the classic When A Stranger Calls but could not find it. Then I saw it. Something that critics claimed \\"was as thrilling as Psycho.\\" Could that be possible? Now that I actually sat through the two hour dud, maybe I should send the critics a bag of crap in regards to their bluffing. Or maybe I should have gotten the Japanese version.  <br />The story here is about a single mother who is at her wits with her ex husband. The two are in a dead lock over the child, as the father wants to move and have his ex wife and daughter relocate close by. Good so far. We feel sympathy for the characters. But unfortunately, it was so unforgettable that a name can't even come to mind.  <br />Somewhere in the poverty stricken area, Jennifer Connelly lands an apartment. At first, she isn't too thrilled about it. Lackluster paint job, bizarre people...weird salesman...you name it, it had it wrong. Her daughter finds a Hello Kitty backpack (the first indication something is going wrong?) and that's where the story is supposed to build. In the bedroom the cieling starts to leak. It is believed to be done by two brothers who always break in. Instead, it is some psycho Russian girl who fell in the water tank on the roof and is now haunting the place. Our heroine shares a similarity with the lead character, in the fact that both of their mother's were neglegant towards their child. Fine, I will buy that. But where is the \\"jumping out of your seat\\" bullcrap that this was hyped about?! The only reason anyone would jump out of their seat is to either take a long cigarette break or to turn the damn DVD off. The ending had a twist where Connelly sacrificed her life for her daughters and ended it on a positive note, but not even God himself would resurrect a movie like this or a sequel. You think after The Grudge America would learn to start writing their own movies rather than hacking originals!
B00000IQC8|5.0|No matter how many times I watch Clerks, it is just as funny and good as it was the first time. The movie is fun and foul-mouthed, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It shows that life isn't always an easy street, but it is full of struggle. No one has learned this in one day more than Dante Hicks, a store clerk who isn't even supposed to work today, and who doesn't let his buddy Randal or the audience forget it.<br /><br />The acting in this brilliant film is fantastic, everyone takes to their role and are very believable people. Being 22 years old, the story sadly relates to my life in more ways than one. Jay and Silent Bob were spawned from this flick, they are quite possibly the greatest duo to grace the silver screen, call it fanboyism but I don't care. This movie just speaks to everyone and it's something everyone can relate to, that's why this film will be around forever and will gain new fans every day. Bravo Kevin, this was worth temporarily losing your comic book collection because this film rocks
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you like Joss Whedon's work, you'll like Serenity.  I bought Serenity because it is by Joss Whedon.  I had not seen the Firefly TV series, but am a fan of Buffy and Angel.  Serenity offers Joss Whedon's wit in a \\"realistic\\" sci-fi world.  The repartee among the ensemble cast is so enjoyable, I've watched it multiple times just for the dialogue and the laughs it brings.  Then I bought the Firefly series.  More wit; more laughs.  Hopefully, there's a TV channel with enough sense to get Firefly back on the air . . . or a film producer to bring us a Serenity sequel.

B00000DFSK|5.0|Este disco compilatorio que recorre la carrera de U2 desde 1980 hasta 1990 (1988, en realidad). Estan casi todos los exitos principales del grupo como \\"Pride\\", \\"With or without you\\", \\"I will follow\\", \\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for\\", entre muchos temas. Quizas las grandes ausencias sean \\"Gloria\\", \\"Two hearts beat as one\\", \\"Bullet the blue sky\\" y quizas \\"A sort of homecoming\\". Quizas tambien \\"When love comes to town\\", podria no haber estado en este compilario. Pero de todas maneras, una gran compilacion, principalmente para los que quieren conocer a U2.
B0000025YW|5.0|This album hammers. Buy it as soon as you can.<br /><br />My reasons for the above simple statement are;<br /><br />1) The title track - with copies of this album available for a mere half a dozen dollars - the title track alone is worth this much.<br /><br />2) The fun doesn't stop there. Track after track of dead on, no holds barred hard rock. This album, like a bunch of Accept discs, is a little bit like listening to a best of collection of AC/DC albums. Sure the humour isn't there as much, but then you do get a slightly different attitude. Where AC/DC aspire to come across as dumb (hey, they're Australian - it's a national trait of ours), Accept don't bother with the affectations and deliver a slightly more metal take on things.<br /><br />3) Further, this album is a stripped back blast, nothing too fancy, just awesome tracks like Guardian of the Night and Love child and the excellent and visceral Fight it Back. The solos are excellent throughout and there is genuine feeling in the slower numbers. The 'ballads' are quite able to take the listener to deep dark places just as much as the rockers.<br /><br />All in all a top achievement by a band who were at the top of their game.
B000AP04L0|5.0|I have watched this so many times that it is scary. Like many others I'm sure, I am absolutely convinced that Mike Judge had some intel on MY employers when he developed this film. There are just WAY too many coincidences! :) ANYone who works in a cubicle will see something in this film that they recognize from their own experience. The really cool thing is that after seeing Office Space, you will view these experiences from a completely different perspective. You may just find yourself smiling at something in the workplace that used to drive you absolutely nuts.
1567184855|5.0|This book and its followup, Destiny of Souls, provides insight into the structure of the spiritual realm that is derived from deep hypnosis sessions.  Journey is a good introduction to the process and basic info on life between lives.  Destiny is much more indepth and provides more cases and analysis by Newton.  My husband and I were intriqued enough by these books to each do a past life regression and a sprititual (life between lives regression) with Nancy Canning  who was trained by Newton.  Our experiences were pretty much consistent with the sessions in the book.  It was and continues to be a profound experience with a great deal of insight that is still unfolding.  We both hope to do future spiritual regressions to further explore the purpose of our current lives and our lives in the spirit realm. If you have a fear of death or a curiosity about what exists after death, I would highly recommend these books.
B00005MP58|5.0|I bought this at my mom's request. She told me that she watched the whole series in one setting. SAhe could not stop watching.
0887307280|3.0|E-Myth Revisited actually takes place in the E-Myth series prior to E-Myth Mastery. This one again uses the example of Sarah and her business of all about pies. Much of my initial reaction to this book was largely negative compared to the E-Myth Mastery, but after getting through with it, there was a large amount of good information. My major gripe with it was that it seemed as if Michael Gerber was pushing the idea of the Franchise Prototype on to the reader as the only way for one to truly be successful in a business, but later on that message seems to soften. The end of the book focuses on the right things of a franchise, which involves creating a business system that makes the business run without YOU, which leads to much less stressful business. In the end though, I would not buy both books, but instead just buy E-Myth Mastery as it seems to set up a much better framework for a business and how to focus one's energies.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|I'll just be brief and get straight to the point. These guys are boring and generic. The ablum \\"Faceless\\" is boring and repetive, with a lack of depth. In general, its not much different from Godsmack's first two releases,...all they did was change the lyrics and mixed the songs around. Gosh, these guys are rip offs,... trying to be like \\"Alice In Chains\\" and everything. Give me a break they named their band after Alice In Chains's \\"God smack\\", all they did was push the word into a compound word and came up with Godsmack. <br />  <br /> Godsmack, are just like Elvis(except they copy Alice In Chains) impersonators I swear to God. They have alot in common.... they love a band/artist,... and to honor them they try to be just like them. As a musician I will tell you that is bulls*it!!! Music is about making your own style of music, not copying an artist. Every band should be original, not be a bunch of boring and generic Alice In Chains wanna bes. They should also add more innovation to their ablum and make each performance special.  <br /> <br /> This ablum plainly is a medicore piece of garabage, with 1-2 good songs 2-3 more average, and the rest being crap. Listen to rock with meaning. This band is not fun to listen too, I'm sorry people have your opinion, but gosh these guys suck. If you happen to like some of Godsmack music,....for the love of (whatever you believe in) pick up an \\"ALice In Chains\\" ablum instead. <br />  <br /> <br />Overall, I give this a 1/5 for being the crap it is.

B000ASDFJU|5.0|Very impressive.  A package with great detail.  Beginning with the hard plastic shell incasement, felt book interface and beautifully presented discs, this complete series is a great, compact- yet fully loaded way to own the complete series.
0307276902|1.0|I knew even before the Oprah scandal that a root canal without pain relief (solely because of a drug addiction) was unreasonable and absolutely untrue.  Many forms of pain relief are non-narcotic.  This book insults all recovering addicts working a 12-step program.  Too bad I wasted my money.
0307276902|2.0|Starts off okay, but as you continue to read this book, it keeps repeating itself.  Anyone who has had drug problems would not want to read this book as it is very depressing and shows no hope.  Most of the people in the book ends up dying except for the author who makes money off it.  Also can't believe most of the book because if you broke as many rules as this person, they would have thrown you out of re-hap.  Would not reconmend this book to anyone.
B000DZIGDU|2.0|Sam Mendes' account of the Gulf War, based on the memoirs of the same title, is as hollow and empty as his much overrated `American Beauty.' By the word `hollow' I am not trying to describe its content or story which avoids the clichs of the war films. The biggest and fatal flaw is that the sneering attitudes of `Jarhead' about the characters it describes. <br /> <br />You don't need any minute summery of the film. It is about one soldier's look on the war, which could be different from the other soldiers', or could be just the same. Though I haven't read the book, it is clear that the film thinks it important to keep the touch of the first-person account of the Gulf War written by former Marine Anthony Swofford. At least I thought so in the first half of the film, which is devoted to the descriptions of the marines' boring and almost aimless life in the desert, just waiting for the war. Well, I have never been in the Marines, but it looks real.  <br /> <br />But as the film goes on, I started to doubt. I do not hate the film because few things happen in the film (because that is exactly the point of the film). On the contrary, too many things happen in it, all of which attempt to give an emphasis upon the emptiness of the war and the life of the Marines. If marines would hate the film because of the negative images of them with crude and immature behaviors, it is understandable. You would keep thinking, either amused or disguised, \\"Is this reality?\\" You never know, because this is after all the first-person account, but the film's real problem lies behind that. <br /> <br />In spite of the strong acting (I agree reluctantly) from Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford, the characters in the film look like amalgam of many exaggerated traits of the Marines. Look at Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) the `spotter,' who can keep cool at various trying experiences in the desert, but suddenly blows it at the moment when he is denied one thing - killing. Look at Staff Sgt, Sykes (Jamie Foxx),mouthy stereotype who suddenly speaks (briefly, as usual) of his background before the burning oil well. Mendes means something profound in these scenes, but what we see is typical war film formula that could have been more effectively done with better hands like Samuel Fuller who really went to war. And behind all of the negative images you can see the sneer of the director who really doesn't believe in anything, who doesn't care the characters even if they are based on t the real-life people. <br /> <br />But after all, what kind of film, whether it is about war or suburbia, can we expect from Sam Mendes, who is a master of cynicism? It is beautifully shot cynicism, but cynicism never believes in anything good in humans. And it is always afraid of finding some merit in what it is sneering at.
B000089RVR|5.0|Entire album, every track is great, even better than her \\"No Angel\\" debut,   positively guaranteed to put you in a cheerful mood.  A glance at the album cover itself get me to smile everytime.  My favorite tracks, and there are soo many:  - White Flag -- fabulous !!  - Life for Rent  - Mary's in India  - See You When You're 40  - Don't Leave Home  - Sand in My Shoes  - Do You Have a Little Time  - This Land is Mine  - See the Sun  A real gem! Highly recommended.
0307276902|5.0|I was introduced to this book by a very close friend who was struggling with a drug addiction.  I read the book nearly two years ago.  If it were not for this book and James' personal message to my friend, I don't think she could have come as far as she has with her recovery.  The fact that some parts of the book may have been embellished do not matter to me or my friend.  The message of James' experience as detailed in this book are still profound and still worth reading and re-reading.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Ya, Biggies better NYC style rap with battle rhymes, but 2pac is easily the better artist. This album is good MUSIC, no matter what you're into you can get into this album. <br /> <br />Method Man and Redman (even INS at the end lol) appear on \\"Got My Mind Made Up\\" (my favorite) and Pac uses Meth's \\"Bring da Pain\\" chorus on \\"No More Pain\\" which is pretty cool. <br /> <br />I like \\"Me Against the World\\" more, but \\"All Eyez on Me\\" is just as deserving of the 5 mic rating it gets and if you give it any less you should stick to all that emo music or whatever the fad is.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I love Gilmore Girls! <br />It's such a funny, heart-warming and intelligent tv show! <br />As I live in Germany, I only get the dubbed versions on tv, which is why I have ordered the DVD's to watch the original version of each episode. <br />Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel are amazing actresses, they make a wonderful mother-daughter team. Their conversations are hilarious and when they're sad I want to cry with them... <br />I don't know why anyone should not like the Gilmore Girls!
0743454537|5.0|This book was great from beginning to end.  It had a grip on my heart on the first page, and tore it out on the last.  I don't ever think I have ever cried so hard as I did when I finished this book.
0060899190|5.0|Nothing much to say, it's exactly like the site but with a very beautiful layout. <br />If you like the site, you will LOVE the book. If you love the site, you will worship this book ;)
B000001F7R|4.0|I bought this album when it first came out.  I was stationed in England at the time.  The only reason I don't give it a big five is that the lead vocals, at the time, just sounded a little too young to have the rock voice edge to make me believe Joe Elliot had experienced it.  Maybe my way of saying you can't really sing the blues until you experience them.  Everthing else about this album is just about perfect.  I kept thinking, at the time, give this group a bit more on the road experience, and they have the potential to be HUGE.  This is a quick snapshot of my thoughts in 1980.  Original album had a cool sound when turntable arm was tracking before it picked up.
B000AARKW6|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. IT HAS LOVE, CRIME AND AL PACINO. A WINNING COMBO.
B000E1YW0E|4.0|I rented this movie at first then I fell in love with this movie and bought the DVD! Love some of the songs,Seasons of Love,One Song Glory,Will I,I'll cover for you (REPRISE), and Without you. Love all of these songs except the movie was alittle boring in some ways.Colorful, Romantic, Powerful and Sad in some ways.Jesse L Martin was a wonderful powerful singer!
0307276902|4.0|THIS BOOK WAS VERY GOOD. IT HAD ME ROOTING FOR THE MAIN chacter TO MAKE IT. IT HAD IT'S LOW POINTS LIKE THE CONSTANT REPEATING OF THINGS. OVER ALL I WAS Pleased with the book.
B00005ATZT|5.0|I've always enjoyed Harrison Ford as an actor and this movie is one of his finest works. There is an excellent build to the climax of the story. Tommy Lee Jones also shines in this with his quick wit & solid values.
B0000027RL|5.0|They are still making quality albums today, and sound just as good live. This album is their first and probably best. Amazing songs like Alive, Jeremy (awesome video) and Black. Check out their other albums too, this band never seems to dissapoint. Oh yeah and that mary person... Go see a doctor.
0780622553|4.0|It won't light up your life but if you like dark sci-fi this is worth the cheap price. The effects aren't bad and the storyline is interesting, if not very plausable. More could have been done to increase the menace level of the bad guys - they just din't seem scary enough, more because of scripting I think and not the acting or make-up which were both adequate and more. <br />Worth seeing.
0060776579|5.0|This book really changes your thinking about money. It helps you to get to the next level of success in life. I already have started a new business and reviewing this author's key points on a daily basis. In 2 years I should be close to becoming a millionaire! Also goto the website that is a part of the book as well.
0783225482|3.0|Not laugh out loud humor but has its funny moments. I had seen this years ago and I just had to see it again. I remembered the ending when the two woman fall apart from the potion they took which was for eternal youth. Worth seeing once and then not again for a while.
B000002I7H|5.0|This is my absolute favorite recording by Albert King. I had the album for years and literally wore it out playing it. I finally got the CD to replace my album and was pleasantly surprised to find it included some additional material not on the LP. Any collection of blues material is not complete without this.  <br /> <br />Albert King's \\"Personal Manager\\" is one of the best examples of why he was such a genious. The soft, syncopated piano, the delayed introduction of horns, the gradual build of energy in his voice and the blazing guitar lead send chills up my spine. I love this CD.
0671027387|4.0|The book club at my work suggested this book a few months ago. I had heard such great things about Dan Brown I decided to make this my first Dan Brown book. I loved it! It had me on the edge of my seat every chapter. He has a habit of writing short chapters and jumping around from one scene to another. Drove me nuts, yet made me keep reading until I found the conclusion I was looking for. The twists of the book were great, and just when I thought I knew what was going on or who the \\"bad guy\\" was... I WAS WRONG! Great book, highly suggested.
B000AWYOGE|3.0|The movie, as the title describes, was dark. I personally don't like these types. However, I thought the acting was good and the suspense also good. For those who like The Ring, this will come as a welcomed movie. As I am not a fan of this genre I just watched it to the end to find out what the mystery was!!!
630587493X|4.0|Great movie, Robin Williams at his best.  Great price on the DVD and fast delivery..
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|If you love comic books, Kids in the Hall, or Super Troopers...you must watch this movie.  I've got 4 words why you need to own this movie: <br />Ron Wilson...BUS DRIVER! <br />Forget Kurt Russell! <br />Look for great supporting roles filled by Kids in the Hall veterans Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald, as well as Kevin Heffernan of Super Troopers/Broken Lizard fame, and don't forget THE MAN HIMSELF...Bruce Campbell!...MUCH better than Bruce's one-minute cameos in Spiderman 1 & 2! (take note Sam Raimi!)   <br />P.S. Watch the Special Features and look for outtakes of young Will Stronghold...this actor is so weird that you feel embarrased to watch his \\"screw-ups\\", and I can't believe they didn't cut it out of the DVD Special Features. <br />P.P.S. Almost as good as The Incredibles and that's a bold statement. <br />P.P.P.S. Look for a tribute to The Toxic Avenger!
B00001OH82|5.0|This is a very underrated album,so what if he changed horses in the middle of the stream going from whatever to whatever.This is Bowie being Bowie.CHANGES !IT's a great album that reflects the period of time in which it was released.It's a little loud,and has a lot of feedback but where would rock and roll be without feedback anyway.Gone was the days of the polished songs and slick productions.Bowie had to do something different, something stripped down.I really like the lyrics (they are kinda dark at times).You could say this was a METAL album,and you'd be right.Personally I thought it was the most exciting thing he'd done since \\"Let's Dance\\" or \\"Scary Monsters\\" and I'm being nice about that!CHANGES,is what makes an artist an artist,and David Bowie is the Frank Sinatra of my generation!
B00025ETIW|4.0|Howdy, I am in my late twenties. I listen to everything from Godflesh/jesu to Converge to Minor Threat/Fugazi to Wu-Tang to Today is the Day to Neurosis. No, I don't like much radio pop music. Infact I cant stand most of it. SO, now you know I'm not a teenybopper and have lived long enough to develop a decent ear for good music.  <br />     <br />I think the teenybopper crowd has shredded this bands credibility to pieces, but that's a different topic. Hypothetically speaking, If you were the first person to hear this record hot off the press I think many of you haters would be floored by it. It's a heavy pop-rock record. It isnt totally original, but holds up well on its own because of the sincerity and catchiness. This sound has been around for at least 15 years. Remembering back to bands like Samiam, Texas is the Reason, Jawbreaker, Afi, Sunny Day Real Estate, Boy Sets Fire, etc. MCR has finally ushered it into the mainstream. They do it well, so why not them? If you listen closely they do not sound very generic at all. The stuff flat out ROCKS. Plain and simple. IT rocks. These dudes are the real deal. Gerard is a great natural born performer. He lives and looks the part of a rock star much like Billy Corgan or Freddie Mercury. He even looks like Billy Corgan. A lot like Corgan actually. It's kinda weird.  <br />     <br />Overall this record is fun and catchy. I feel like they really care about making art.. not just radio hits. The vocals don't bother me at all. They are sincere and passionate. To me they don't seem fake or contrived. The true test of this band will be the next record. If they can top this one I think many heads will turn in their direction. To do that they will need to reinvent themselves a little bit. Hopefully they won't get too sappy or radio friendly. We'll see won't we.
B000A6T262|5.0|I had forgotten how much I love these movies, and the special features make this a GREAT buy for the price.  The only suggestion that I have if you only like sequential series is to get past the first movie.  The first one may be strange (and not really fit into the plot line of the rest of the movies) but it only gets better after that.
B000001ED1|4.0|Mostly got this album for the famed 'Joan of Arcadia' song.  The CD is filled with a good spectrum of Rock & Roll, some blues and mostly Joan Osbournes beautiful character.  I wasn't familiar with her before, though I knew she was famous.  Now I know why.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|When I first read the book in high school, I was less than thrilled and couldn't pick out the wit, but the 2005 movie has done a great job at that! I encourage anyone to watch this movie to appreciate a heart warming romance. A great girls night out movie.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Her smooth sexy voice returns with remakes of classic songs with an uptempo and modern flip, and yet without altering the original flavor. This is by far my favorite live album and Sade cemented her position as my favorite artist. <br /> <br />You don't find this level poise, grace and class in popular artists anymore! The live vocals are astounding  especially in tracks such as: Is it a Crime, No Ordinary Love and Flow. <br /> <br />A must have in any collection!!!!
0446677450|4.0|This book was an eye opener for me and made me want to learn more!  I am currently reading Cashflow Quadrant and will move on to the ABC's of purchasing real estate.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a great series, with alot of action. The actors were great and you could beleive what they were doing. I loved the way they all got along in there own weired way. It is a must see and a great addition to any collection.
B00008J2PG|5.0|I'm Protestant ... and some may think this is only a movie for Catholics ... but this movie transcends 'religion'.   It is a movie for anyone facing adverse times and the difficult choices one must make (the choice between protecting self, or risking all for someone who cannot give anything in return).   Because of this, it has always been one of my favorites.    <br /> <br />Based on a real events, is shows what one man can do, in the face of fear, uncertainty, hatred and unspeakable cruelty ... and demonstrates that one can face these things victoriously without being turned into the very thing you're resisting.   <br /> <br />When you look at world events today ... you see that so often, hatred and cruelty is responded too by hatred and cruelty.  This movie is a powerful reminder that you do not have to turn into the very evil that is confronting you.   The footnote at the end of the movie is particularly significant ... because it shows the power of love and forgiveness.   It demonstrates in real life what it means to practice true Christian love. <br /> <br />Gregory Peck wonderfully portrays a man struggling with his natural hot temper and the call to humility.  He's a man of action and he shows that you can ALWAYS do something when confronted with evil.  He also struggles with matching his actions with the dictates of his faith ... and being sure that they do not contradict each other.  In his inner struggles, he always chooses to do for someone who can do nothing in return ... and chooses not to protect himself. <br /> <br />Christopher Plumber wonderfully portrays someone who has been indoctrinated with power of hate; and the desire to impress his superiors; and he shows the odd way someone can justify one's actions and yet be so loving to his family; and shows his hidden desire to believe that this world really isn't the cruel place he has found it to be ... and the wishful thinking that the teachings of Christianity COULD be true ... even when all the evidence he has seen in his life, tells him there is no truth in any of this.   It kind of reminds you of Pilates statement to Christ ... \\"What is Truth?\\"   All his decisions in life center on protecting himself, and his family.  Not bad things in themselves.   But given the times he lived in, the choice between doing the right thing, and protecting self ... was the difference between death and life.   It was easier to 'go with the flow' than stand up for what was right.  Yet something in his conscience wanted to hold on to the hope that there was something better out there. <br /> <br />All in all ... a very powerful telling of how people face the difficult choices they are faced with in life.   Hard times always bring these things into greater focus.   In good times, it is easy to say you believe in things.  It is only under pressure, when you are faced with life and death choices, that you find out what you really believe. <br />
1416905014|5.0|After finishing a 'Cinderella-thon' with all 9 of my first grade classes, I shared the Cinderella PopUp Book.  They were enthralled in its contents!  Even the boys were entriqued by the designs!  A must have for your Cinderella collection in a school Media Center.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Errol Morris, with greater artistry than anyone I know, consistenly sheds light on the complex without trying to simplify.  \\"Fog of War\\" is a nuanced examination, through the self-narrative of one of its principal architects, of the processes that led to the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.  The attempt at a deeper understanding does not come at the cost of moral laxity, but rather left me with a deeper understanding of what went wrong and what was wrong with the conflict in Vietnam -- and not any caricatures in my head of McNamara or the other participants.
B0002STNQ2|4.0|My father had bought this book for me a few months after it had come out, I being a farly big Cricthon fan claimed to him I was going to read it but never did, It manged to collect a thin layer of dust over the year I had kept it in my wooden blue shelf. Then fineally I picked it up, I read the first few pages thought to myself \\"hmm...seems alright\\" and then flipped threw it over a period of a week or so. And Micheal Circhton's Prey is a enjoyable, Interesting and At times suspenfull novel. Though it is not exactly what I would personally call Mr. Crichtons Best, but all in all a farly good and thought provoking read. I Liked Prey. <br /> <br />I didn't love it, nor did I hate it. I Simply Liked it. <br /> <br />The plot is good, the characters are what is to be expected in an average thriller novel (Yet there are a few that are actually quite beyond this kind of genre) and It has what Crichton is famous for, his cutting edge science. It was a easy read, though at times the scientific terms and technological ramblings can get a little confusing, yet its not like you need a encyclopedia next to you. As the book progessed I found my self turning the pages vigoursly, wanting to figure out the mysteries that begin at the start of the novel. Some would say that he was slow to get to the point, but i thought it was this that made it Interesting. <br /> <br />The whole drive of wanting to find out why and how the bizzare occurances are happening in Jacks (The Main Chracter Of the Story)Home. I strongly recomend this book for people who are interested in computer technology and the typical man makes monster, monster tries to destroy man stories. But I think Crichton fanactics will be a little disapointed as the way the sotry is told from a first person view seems to lessen the suspense as you know he's goin to be all right in the end, because after all if its from his view and he dies then how would he tell the story? And I also felt it lacked Mr.Crichton's keen descriptivetouch. In my opinion this well derived and famous author is slipping, this was defineatly not his best writing. Oh well, perhaps next time Micheal Crichton will write better...if he even writes at all.
0790733226|5.0|This is not your typical sci-fi movie, simply because the book on which this was based was written by the late Dr. Carl Sagan, Ph.D., a world-renowned professor of astronomy.   <br /> <br />Don't expect green women seducing the captain of a starship, nor fist-fights with aliens (which is a bit ridiculous when you really think about it), nor aliens that are simply 'human in every way' except (for example): a) they have pointy ears and suppress their emotions, or b) they have a violent streak and have interesting foreheads, or c) they are short, have large ears, and are incredibly greedy.  Remove the ears, the unusual foreheads and the big ears and what do you have?  Just a variety of human beings -- those seeking emotional self-control and spiritual development, violent warrior-types and unethical, money-grubbing businessmen.   <br /> <br />As much as I truly TRULY love other sci-fi series, virtually all the above aliens are bi-peds (two-legged) and are about as technologically advanced as humans are at that point in the future.   <br /> <br />If another race of aliens were only a couple hundred years ahead of us militarily and technologically, they could blow humans out of the water if they chose to do so.  Why?  Because scientific knowledge increases exponentially and therefore with an ever-increasing increasing speed.  (Just look at what we human beings have learned in the last 50 years.) <br /> <br />Several people that I know that saw Contact did not understand beforehand that Carl Sagan was trying to depict how First Contact might REALLY happen with a far more advanced, non-violent species that wished to communicate with us, with as little trauma as possible.  Some of my acquaintances were disappointed that there were very little special effects. <br /> <br />The bottom line:  This is an absolutely wonderful movie for those who have the patience and intelligence to appreciate a believable, insightful film which: a) thoughtfully depicts the individual characterswho make the discovery, and b) also explores how different groups of people throughout the world might react to a First Contact that the entire planet suddenly becomes aware of. <br /> <br />Expect outstanding, \\"slower-paced-yet-fascinating!\\", subtle, insightful writing and first-class acting.  Expect realism, not computer-generated aliens, nor an excessive reliance on special effects, nor a predictable, canned Hollywood script, nor a predictable Hollywood ending.   <br /> <br />Human reality is rarely predictable and is often both 'tumultous and disappointing' on the one hand, but also 'amazing and beautiful beyond words' on the other.  Definitely 5 stars!!!

B000CNESU8|5.0|'Network' is unquestionably one major cinematographic achievement of the 70's, but it is also well known among die-hard movie buffs as one of the very few movies allowing for a nice glimpse of Ms Dunaway's anatomy (in the bed scene with William Holden). Now, although this new release is technically much better than Warner's previous release, it is widescreen only whereas the older version offered both widescreen and pan & scan versions - and the P & S version, although heavily cropped on the sides, was slightly less matted on top and bottom, thus offering a better view of the above mentioned treat. <br />So, gentlemen, although this new release is definitely worth buying, maybe the old one is worth keeping on your shelf as well...
B00008RH3L|3.0|The single most important thing to me about a movie, or any other form of entertainment, is that it holds my interest.  This one did, most of the time, with a few exceptions.<br /><br />Another thing I'm looking for in a movie is that it has a satisfying ending.  This one doesn't, which is a shame.  It leaves you feeling blah.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like a well made movie, worth a look.  Don't expect anything that will lift your spirits.  The ending is really pretty pointless, just a dud.
B000ASDFEU|5.0|I am a major history buff and have a large library of war movies in my basement and I can say that is one of my favorites. When I found out that they had come out with a special addition with behind the scenes features I was willing to spend around 34 dollars and have sent over from England. I would like to point out some things that my fellow reviewers discussed about the movies. First off, Elliot Gould is perfectly fine in his portrayl of an Airbrone officer, and he adds some comic relief to the film. The battle scenes are well done, ESPECIALLY THE SCENE WHEN THE BRITISH PARATROOPERS AT THE BRIDGE DEFEAT THE GERMAN RECON FORCE, which was nicely done and showed how the British troops that were really there didn't go down without a fight and inflicting heavy casualties. The acting is amazing, an all star cast with each actor bringing his own unique effect on the movie. Mr. Attenbourough really makes you care about the soldiers and makes you see just how close the operation was to succeeding. The battle scenes are well done, and while not all the machinery in the movie is exactly authentic, people complaining about that should just get over it becuase Im sure the crew looked as hard as they could to find as much surplus as they could and also tanks don't make a good war, its the soldiers and their realtionships and hardships. This is a wonderful movie that should be viewed by any war movie buff not only for your own sake but also to help remember those men who fought in those desperate days in September.
0307276902|1.0|This book is an absolute fraud and I feel cheated in buying this book!!! I have worked as an RN for thirty years and I have worked in the area of drug and alcohol abuse. After the first 100 pages which I fought to read, I knew this was not an accurate account. The dentist visit as it was reported could not have happened. Hospitals/Rehab are governed by laws and patient safety is not compromised under any condition. If this book had been written and been truthful it might have been used to help others instead it puts an abuser in a poor light again.  <br />

B0009X7664|1.0|Nothing to do with the film itself, just the product packaging.  This is advertised as a special collectors' package that was supposed to include extras inside, but after two shipments of the item both turned up empty, I gave up.<br /><br />Amazon.com promised to issue credit in the form of a gift card, but never did.  I will be shopping at Barnes & Noble's site in the future.
B0000C7PQK|4.0|I was reluctant to get this CD because I never heard anything from it.  I'm glad I purchased this one.  Michael Cretu still has that driving force in him and still produces a fantastic set of music.  He not only stays with the typical Enigma style but he also incorporates some up to date modern music.  Baum Baum is the worst song and the only bad one on this album.  I didn't care for that one so much.  This track is good for a club dance song.  Despite one bad song, that still keeps this CD in the fantastic, awesome category.  What can I say?  Not every song on every CD is going to be great.  But with 5 albums and one bad song out of the lot, three cheers for Michael Cretu and crew.  And by the way, whoever the female singer is on Enigmas CDs, she is out of this world and makes me melt with that beautiful sensual voice of hers.

B00005OMTT|5.0|Fantastic set of songs.  This compilation includes two new songs.  I have a hard time trying to pick wich Enigma CD to listen to because they're all great.  This CD covers it all.  So this is my choice whenever I want to listen to Enigma because it covers their first 4 albums.  I've read that Enigma is not a band but a Project.  Well, this is one of the best projects I've heard since Alan Parsons Project.  If you're like me and have a hard time choosing an Enigma, then get this one and you'll have them all.
0385486804|5.0|I just re-read this book, which I first came across while on a camping trip in Alaska in 2001.  <br />While the impact of the book is stronger when read with the prospect (however remote) of an Alaskan Grizzly ripping through your tent, it remains an amazing story when read in an urban setting. <br />I'm not giving anything away in telling you that it is about a young man who died alone in the Alaskan wilderness. Krakauer (Into thin Air, Eiger Dreams, Outback Magazine writer)tells you the ending in the first few pages.  Even so, it is a tough book to put down.   <br />Krakauer, who in my view tells an adventure story as well as anyone, struck pay-dirt when he came across a subject with the character strength of Christopher McCandless, a young idealist with all the markings of genius who goes to extreme lengths to reject materialism.  Krakauer pieces together the last years of McCandless' life, including several \\"tramping\\" adventures, the last of which is a plan to subsist independently for months in the Alaskan wilderness.   The story is told through McCandless' diaries, his family and - most interesting in my view - the people who McCandless met while roaming through the states. <br />This story had to be told by someone who could relate to McCandless (many people have expressed the view that McCandless' exploits were - to put it delicately - foolhardy). Krakauer empathizes with McCandless to the point of drawing very direct parallels between his own life and McCandless'.   <br />I suspect this story will only appeal to those who, like Krakauer, have some  admiration for McCandless. If you are an adventurer at heart, you will likely find McCandless' idealism and bravery inspirational.  Even if you don't sell everything and hit the open road, you may enjoy this book enough to read it more than once and to recommend it to your friends (as I did). <br />Those who lean towards cocooning and materialism will find McCandless weird (at best), and will probably find this book pointless.

1400034205|5.0|I'm not going to go into depth on the book since others have already done so in a very complete and interesting way, but I just want to note that I read this book (the first time I've read W. Somerset Maugham)as the result of seeing the movie starring Bill Murray. Although I really liked the movie, the book has an incredible depth and more fully explores the entire concept of seeking your inner truth. I found the book considerably different than the movie in both storyline and completeness. A very fulfilling read.

B0009PM5ZY|1.0|Bootleg alert! I am also a collector and trader of Led Zeppelin and other live concerts.  It is not worth it to buy this. In some countries, it is in fact illegal to buy these. If you want it, you should seek out traders and make deals with them. It should never be any cost to you, and the traders will trade you for a bootleg you have, or for blank CD's and postage (B & P trading). Do not buy bootlegs, ever, when you can trade them for free.

B000B7HZXM|5.0|As always, The Great American Songbook IV was wonderful.  However, number II and III are still my favorites.  The difference is just that I personally liked the song selections on those two the most. <br /> <br />This new one is just a great.

B000BJS4OY|4.0|The bonus DVDs were riveting.  I am a Springsteen fan, I have listened to many of his albums and have seen him in concert several times over 30+ years. I believe he is a unique talent, much more introspective and articulate than most - and his music is generally quite solid and enjoyable.  I bought this set in order to get the 2 bonus DVDs and I have to say that they have provided me with hours of quality entertainment.  Watching the \\"Wings for Wheels\\" DVD gave me a deeper appreciation of Springsteen as an artist, particularly in his early years.  I think it should be used in school to help people understand not just how an artist works his craft, but also to understand many of the difficulties a team and a leader have to work through to accomplish a complex but ultimately rewarding - in this case life-changing - achievement.  The second DVD of Springsteen's 1975 London concert was also quite good, showing a young, very tight, confident band performing Bruce's early classics.  There is much more to a Springsteen live performance than to simply listening to the great music, hopefully you've had the pleasure of catching him in concert - but not many of his current fans saw him in 1975 so here's your chance to experience that.
B00003CXAW|5.0|i really thought it was great, i still have not got my dracula dvd. an i am not pleased thank you,
B000AADYYO|5.0|first of all, the \\"child\\" who continuously posts nonsensical reviews here (and I see he now has taken to being a racist and pretending to be black) should simply go back to listening to the bands he likes--he likes bands whose singers have not hit puberty yet and whose definition of music is the sound of people shoving guitar's up their butt. Fine, that's wonderful for him. He's had his say. Now he should bugger off..or at the very least learn basic spelling, punctuation, and grammar before he's allowed to review on this site again.  <br />   On to the real music. Admittedly, i only have four Opeth albums, but their music is diverse, transcendent, hypnotic, lush, rhythmic, and masterful. Yes, it's a bit depressing and melancholic, but by employing this, Opeth reaches heights of beauty and talent that are nearly unparalleled. Opeth is truly amazing and Mikael Akerfeldt (sp?) is on par musically with vocalists such as Maynard James Keenan. Following is a short review of each song. <br /> <br />Ghost of Perdition: ---10/10. This song sets the stage for all that follows it. If you're not prepared, the sonic blast of sound that erupts after the 8 seconds of quiet, melodic strumming will knock you senseless. After the hellacious fury of the first segment of the song, the clean vocals come in with a very rousing melody, after which the heaviness dies out for a few moments, and a serene, almost choir-sounding segment comes in before re-working up to a fury-filled climax.  <br /> <br />Baying of the Hounds: --- 9/10 A blast of pure hell-breathing fury straight from the mouth of the hounds of hell. Yes, there is a mellow segment, but even then it still has a raging intensity to it.  <br /> <br />Beneath the Mire: --- 9/10 Almost a classic-rock feel to it. This is a good song, except for the very end of it, which just peters out and is a bit boring.  <br /> <br />Atonement: --- 10/10 The middle eastern guitars that sound throughout the song are truly quite beautiful, creatinga soothing, hypnotic song that is the first chance to catch your breath after having your brain loosened from its hold in your skull. Akerfeldt's voice shines.  <br /> <br />Reverie/ Harlequin Forest: --- 15/10.  In my opinion, the best song on this album. A great melody. The first half is superior, but the entire song explodes in rapturous fire.  <br /> <br />Hours of Wealth: --- 10/10.  This song is slow and quiet, another \\"resting period.\\" A little odd, as it is infused with an undeniable tinge of jazz. But again, Akerfeldt's voice is haunting and the guitar work is very serene and creates a nice mood.  <br /> <br />The Grand Conjuration: --- 6/10.  Some people adore this song. Personally, I don't like it. The musical complexity just isn't there like it is in all of the other songs. It's straightforward intensity, but it lacks the driving ambition and musical taste that, say, \\"Baying of the Hounds\\" has.  <br /> <br />Isolation Years: --- 9/10. I really enjoyed this song, much to my surprise. Akerfeldt's voice is a little high, but he manages it well. This song is a bit depressing, but it makes up for it in beauty.  <br />
0596007124|4.0|This book is one of the best books on Patterns. I recommend everyone interested in improving their design skill to read it.

B000AY74OG|5.0|Witty, fun, delightful entertainment for adults and kids. My 3 year old's favorite movie so far. But watch out! The signature song in the movie \\"I Like to Move It\\" will be played a million times a day by your kids!
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|The first time I watched it the first scenes of the movie quickly grasped my attention and didn't let me go until the last scene of the movie during the 'Passing Parade'. Truly riveting, the watcher is taken through the lives of three friends torn apart by one event that changed them forever. Brought back together by the murder of Jimmy's (Sean Penn) eldest daughter, Sean (Keven Beacon) struggles against time to solve the case before Dave (Tim Robbins) is wrongly accused. Winner of two academy awards, Mystic River is the one movie to see, and to appreciate for the true artistic composition of Clint Eastwood as he weaves together yet another classic for the ages.
0060989157|5.0|I found The Dirt to be a riveting read, but it is not for the faint of heart. It is vulgar, filled with decadent stories about sex, drugs and rock and roll. It is a powerful story taking you to the deepest darkest parts of rock and roll. I wouldn't recommend it for kids - it is for mature audiences only. Despite all of that, I enjoyed every bit of it.
B000E1YVZU|2.0|For someone who has never seen the musical performed live, I watched this movie and couldn't help thinking that something, and something VERY IMPORTANT was missing. The personality. The depth of the characters.<br /><br />The movie jumped from song to song and there was no character building. The jist of RENT is to show the year in the life of Bohemians in the East Village of New York City struggling with life, love and AIDS, and the impacts they have on America. Yet, I couldn't help thinking that we really and truly didn't get to know these people. And... IMPACT on AMERICA?? I haven't the slightest clue.<br /><br />Is it the filmmakers fault? Not sure. Probably not. I just think that there is SO MUCH MATERIAL HERE that gets portrayed in a stage play that was absolutely impossible to portray in a 2 hour movie.<br /><br />The music is phenominal. The spirit of the film is there. The film opens up with the cast singing the wonderful song SEASON OF LOVE, and to me, from that point on, it became a hyperactive jump from one plot point to the next and never slowed down to actually let you know these people.<br /><br />Adam Pascal plays Roger Davis, a former rocker, that is scarred because a former love of his life killed herself with drugs, which we see in brief flashbacks. Rosario Dawson plays Mimi Marquez who sings one of the coolest songs in the movie OUT TONIGHT. She, apparently has a problem with drugs too, but I never got the gist of that until they found her on the street dieing. Apparently, they all have AIDS, but I didn't understand that Roger and Mimi did until they went to the meeting, which they had been avoiding.<br /><br />Wilson Jermaine Heredia plays a convincing drag queen named Angel Dumott Schunard. His funeral, which is supposed to be a big emotional moment of the movie, went right over my head. The reason? There was just too much ground to cover, too many stories to tell, too many characters to get to know, that we didn't get to know ANY OF THEM.<br /><br />I could go on about the things in this movie, but it's just that everything was too vague and unexplored. Later in the movie, Roger decides he's leaving to go to Sante Fe. Apparently, a big deal. Everyone is sad and depressed because of this... they show about a 5 minute MTV clip of him walking through a desert singing and he's back home and everybody is SO EXCITED!<br /><br />The movie wasn't bad for me because the music was bad, the music was awesome... in fact, just buy the CD... the movie was bad for me because all of the emotional impact things, the moments that will make you understand the characters and understand the troubles that they are going through are so VAGUE and UNEXPLORED, I had little to no interest in the film at all.OF THEM. <br /> <br />I could go on about the things in this movie, but it's just that everything was too vague and unexplored.

0800141660|5.0|Emma Thompson continues to astound me with her talent. Not only is she one of the greatest actresses working today, the woman can also write! And write well she does. Jane Austen is a frightfully difficult mountain to tackle for even the most experienced of screewriters, and Thompson conquers this feat with the adroitness of an learned professional. (Her Academy Award shows others thought so too)  <br /> <br />Emma Thompson plays Elinor Dashwood, a practical-minded young lady who spends most of her energy looking after her two sisters and mother, which unfortunately gets in the way of her marrying. Kate Winslet plays Marianne Dashwood, a passionate lively young woman who isn't afraid of showing her love to anyone. Alan Rickman also delights as the staid Colonel Brandon (oh my god, his voice...) and Hugh Grant is appropriately 'English' as the bumbling Mr. Ferrars with whom Elinor falls in love.  <br /> <br />Particularly dazzingly performances from Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet, though their youngest sister, little Margaret, also gives a memorable performance as a spunky, geography-minded girl. All in all, a remarkable film and one to purchase and watch over and over again.

0142401668|5.0|Fourteen-year old Alex Rider knows something bad has happened when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  He soon learns that his caretaker uncle, Ian Rider, was killed in an automobile accident on his way home.  A banker who works for Royal & General, Alex's uncle was a fine man who wasn't home much--but he's still devastated by his death.  Except the appearance of some strange people who claim to be his uncle's co-workers, a gun-toting man at his uncle's funeral, and the findings of his uncle's bullet-ridden car make Alex think that there's more than meets the eye to the \\"automobile accident\\" story.<br /><br />Alex soons find out that his Uncle Ian's life, at least where he himself was concerned, was based on a lie.  Ian Rider was a spy, employed by the Special Operations Divison of MI6.  And the last case he was working on, concerning multi-millionaire Herod Sayle, was a case that got Ian Rider killed.  Now Mr. Blunt and Mrs. Jones, head of SOD, want Alex to pick up where his uncle, their operative, left off--infiltrate the compound where Herod Sayle is building his new Stormbreaker computers, and find out what Ian Rider had to die for.<br /><br />What follows is an action-packed story of danger, bullets, viruses, and out-and-out excitement.  At fourteen, Alex is savvy, trained in martial arts, can speak multiple languages, and is, in fact, a truly bliddy good spy!<br /><br />Anthony Horowitz has devised a real winner with Alex Rider and his new career (although he was actually forced into working for MI6), and I can't wait to read the next book in the series and see what mission Alex will be sent on next!
B000BKVQTS|1.0|The Brothers Grim <br /> This was truly a bad movie.  I don't know how anybody could give this anything more than two stars.  I was expecting a dark story that somehow integrated some of the Grimm fairytales in an interesting manner.  I got a ridiculous plot that had no point and made no sense.  The comedy was stupid at best.  At many times during the movie I found myself wondering what the heck was even going on.  I was starting to warm up to the movie because it seemed to start to embrace it absurdity.  Then they threw in some scenes that were supposed to be dramatic and serious and I once again lost all interest.  I am still not sure what the brothers actually did to stop the evil curse?  What was the significance of anything that happened in the final sequence?  I am shocked that one experienced reviewer commented on how the story provoked thought about the legends and what they said about history.  I feel that the movie didn't hold true to any of the wonder of the Grimm fairytales.  I loved these stories when I was younger, and this movie used their popularity to create interest in a horrible movie.  At the end Angelika is kissing both brothers.  What the heck is up with that?  The ending was all very confusing to me.  I would not recommend this movie to anybody.  Most of the time if I see a movie that I don't like I will still tell people to watch it and form their own opinion.  With this one I am just going to say, \\"don't waste your time.\\"  After watching it I thought that nobody could have found any redeeming qualities in this movie.  That is why I was so surprised that The Brothers Grimm actually got some good reviews.  This movie lacks any substance, which is why I was surprised that the script was able to attract actors like Damon and Ledger.    This was definitely a fluff piece for both of them, that they should probably be ashamed of in my opinion.   <br />
B000002HAJ|5.0|Alright, I've heard alot of people say that they don't like this album, purely because of the song 'Friday I'm In Love'. Well, this is quite possibly one of my most favorite albums ever recorded. The song 'Cut' is a great song. The quiet tone of the album makes it a great album to fall asleep to. In my opinion, a must for any Cure fan.
B00068CVJ4|5.0|In my opinion, this is ATDI's greatest piece of work and am sad that it was their last. But they have gone on to create great music with The Mars Volta so I guess its all good. Anyways, the album is terrific and I feel like rating them song by song: <br /> <br />Arcarsenal (9/10) Great opener shouting Beware! and thats right, the listener should beware of what they are about to embark on. <br /> <br />Pattern Against User (9.5/10) I love that part in the beginning where he goes \\"Hey\\". One of my fav on the CD. <br /> <br />One Armed Scissor (9.5/10) of course everyones favorite, this is the song that introduced me to ATDI. Terrific song. <br /> <br />Sleepwalk Capsules (10/10) GReat song, very fast and energetic. My favorite song. <br /> <br />Invalid Litter Dept (7/10) I never really liked this song. I just dont like how the lyrics are spoken through most of the song but it gets better at the end of the song. <br /> <br />Manneqin Republic (9.5/10) yess, I love the screaming on this song, very awesome song. Second best song. <br /> <br />Enfilade (8.5/10) Besides from that annoying part in the beginning of the song with the phone I like this song, has a nice beat to it \\"Sacrifice on railroad tracks!\\" <br /> <br />Rolodex Propaganda (8/10) Even though Iggy Pop sings backup vocals on this song, I just find it kind of annoying, pretty good song. <br /> <br />Quarantined (9/10) A bit slower of a song but still great, nice bass in this song and I like the thunderstorm sounds. <br /> <br />Cosmonaut (9/10) Real fast paced song with the guitars. \\"Is it heavier than air?\\" <br /> <br />Non-Zero Possibility (8/10) Slow song with piano, pretty good. \\"Bitten on the entrance\\". <br /> <br />Bonus songs: <br />Extracurricular (8.5/10) has probably the most screaming of all songs, but it just isnt too great. <br /> <br />Catacombs (9.5/10) Great beggining to this song with the clapping and guitars. Also the ending has very powerful vocals screaming \\"This gravitys a quadraplegic horse and carriage\\". Very good song and nice ender. <br /> <br />So overall this CD kicks butt and should be owned by everybody. I love Cedric and Omar with a passion.
B00008G9JN|4.0|Hadn't heard this one in 25 years, and it had been a guilty pleasure when last I heard it, because I was leaving the prog world at that time.  Hearing it again, Anderson wrote some fine melodies on this record.  I always liked the Solstice Bells song and Jack in the Green but some of the others were better than I remembered.  Many fine instrumental sections, too, although the guitar had gotten very stylized by this time.  And the production is way over the top as usual when Robin Black had the knobs.  I think he also did Passion Play and Benefit.  I dislike the splice jobs that the Jethros resorted to so often in this period because sudden, wrenching changes of instrumentation kind of break the flow.  The lyrics can be a bit crude, but it's an entertaining spin.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Untill last week I thought the Beach Boys were all Surfin and fast cars. But I bought this album because of what I heard about it being a total 180 from what the Beach Boys originally did, and it's true...This is an outstanding piece of work, and I can see why it is so hihgly thought of.  Brian Wilson was definatly at his best w/ Pet Sounds...Is this the greatest album of all time? Well my opinion there are a couple that I might consider \\"the best\\" (Oddesey and Oracle for one) but thats only my opinion.  But this definatly is a classic...it's a shame that the public couldn't appreciate Pet Sounds then as much as now because it spoke about the life back in 1966.  But it's great that people like it even more now and keep it alive.  I highly suggest this album for anyone who might think that the Beach Boys are nothing but surf music.  You will be pleasently suprised
1416905014|5.0|After reading (well, there is a lot more than just read!) \\"the wonderful wizard of oz\\" and \\"a winter tale\\" of the same author, I could not resist Cinderella and Alice in wonderland. I haven't yet opened Alice so I won't comment on it, but I know I won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />This is one of the most beautiful pop-up books I have ever seen. It is just magical and so clever in the way things do not just pop-up, but morph into something else (I am sorry, my vocabulary is a bit poor, but I do not want to spoil anybody else's surprise!). Of course, I bought these books for my 6 year old daughter - convenient excuse - but they stay on the living room table where we can pick them up anytime and marvel at the animated pictures. Every one of these books is a real piece of art!  <br />
B000005YZM|5.0|Before this I was not all that fond of The Zombies, thinking that all they did was R&B style stuff, but I thought I'd try this CD out and I was blown away.  This is better than Sgt. Pepper to be honest with you...it just is outstanding collection of works.  It suprising that The Zombies didn't make this a huge smash when it came out.  But I can definatly see why this was rated one of the top 100 albums of all time.  Now I'm way more into the Zombies and am out to find more of their later stuff.  This is a definate buy.

0307263118|5.0|This is the ninth book by Banville I've read (and reviewed here); while others have told you about the basic plot, I'd like to share a few thoughts on how this novel differs from as well as continues with the author's characteristic concerns.<br /><br />I usually cite a few of my favorite phrases from each of his novels. Here, I instead refer you to turn to--when you open a copy--pg. 87; the long paragraph captures life's evanescence more movingly than perhaps any prose outside of a religious text has done, in my reading experience. Banville at his best (\\"Book of Evidence,\\" \\"Shroud,\\" \\"The Untouchable\\") offers in his later novels shrewd, middle-aged or elderly, male, narrators from society's margins who finagle their way into power--however fleetingly, and then fall from grace with a thud. They manage nonetheless to dust themselves off and go on calmly telling you their sad story with lots of self-justification, at times honestly earned! So, Max seems in \\"The Sea\\" to match this pattern, although he's less eminent than many of Banville's typical protagonists.<br /><br />What's evident here, and what may have gained Banville the prize and a boost in long-deserved but previously elusive wider acclaim, is compression. In even his strongest works, I felt that the controlling voice could have been edited a bit with no loss. I know every author would disagree, but as a reader, even Banville's most gregarious or sinister tale-tellers can weary their listener with so much eloquence so eloquently recondite.<br /><br />Max's tale, by comparison, runs only two hundred pages. Where in most of his other novels I felt Banville could have cut at least 50 pages, here the length fits for the first time. The revelations saved for the epiphany--of the reader and not the protagonist in Banville's usual construction--do arrive as late in the book as customarily. But, given the relative brevity of \\"The Sea,\\" they arrive when the reader's less wearied to fully appreciate their impact.<br /><br />Many readers, I know, feel rather intimidated by Banville. He demands attention. With this care, his craft rewards you subtly and lingeringly. Perhaps as much as to Nabokov, Beckett, and Joyce, he's indebted to James, Woolf, and even Faulkner--none among the latter trio who I've been able to enjoy as I have the first three authors. Still, in this novel, the skill with which Max's tale is rendered shows well that Banville, as he matures into his sixth decade himself, has arrived at a place where (post?)modernist pyrotechnics have faded, and where more intricately assembled paragraphs constructed as if kaleidoscopes expand.el rather intimidated by Banville.

6305212112|3.0|Nothing to do on a Wednesday night, I watched Fried Green Tomaotoes on TV.  The movie has an intriguing beginning, great acting, and a positive message.   <br /> <br />Dumpy housewife Evelyn Couch befriends Ninny Threadgoode on her visit to see her husband's Aunt Vespa.  While waiting for her husband, Evelyn converses with Ninny and the two become friends.  Throughout three quarters of the movie, the audience is told of the life of Idgie Threadgoode and her frienship with Ruth Jamison.  Ruth is a victim of an unfortunate marriage.  After the death of her mother, Ruth decides to leave her husband.  She is also pregnant with their child.  After leaving her husband, Ruth and Idgie open the Whistle Top cafe that soon becomes famous for its Green Fried Tomato recipe and bar-b-que. <br /> <br />A murder pulls the events in the story forward followed by the search for the killer and Idgie's blame for the victim's death.  We are also shown the change of Evelyn Couch from dumpy housewife to don't-push-me-around-I-love-my-feminie-organ power woman.  At times her new found feminity may seem overboard but it is not without a personal triumph that is shared by the viewer (the grocery store parking lot incident). <br /> <br />My pet peeve with the movie is its feminist message, especially through Evelyn Couch's transformation.  Granted, I was most convinced by Idgie and Ninny's portrayl, but there is this evident lack of respect for men, namely Evelyn's husband.  Perhaps the man is incapable of change, but in this day and age, men have made progress and have learned to co-exist (if you will) with their female significant others.  There is power in being assertive and making up your own mind, granted, but not at the expense of making the jerk look even more like a jerk and somehow making him incapable of change.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Many reviews compare this version of the movie to the television mini-series.  I would encourage audiences to take the film on its own merits, though as a Colin Firth fan, I will admit that can be a difficult thing to do.  Give Matthew Macfadyen a chance.  I like this role and other work he's done.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable film.  While some of the locations are changed, and it doesn't use the exact language of the book, I think it keeps very closely to the spirit and plot of the book. The Mr. Wickham story is severly compressed, but I think that they get the point across.  Besides, with the shorter time allotment, I would rather that was clipped than some other sections.  Especially enjoyable was the treatment of Mrs. Bennett.  Some versions make her so vapid and silly one wonders how she functions in society at all.  This Mrs. Bennett was more balanced while still fiting the character of the novel.<br /><br />Also memorable is the look of the film.  The sets, scenery, and costumes all feel realistic, and yet they are not so real and gritty that they lose their beauty.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine film and well worth watching.
0393317552|5.0|It's a great study of how geography has played a crucial role on the development of human societies.  Jared Diamond provides a credible theory, pertaining to the greatness of many otherwise politically indistinct cultures and explains how their development relates to the modernized Western world. Furthermore, particularly early, it's a captivating, mind expanding read.
0757302661|4.0|Although I did not finish the book before having my baby, what I read was helpful.  I was able to relax during labor and have my baby without an epidural which was my goal.  The breathing exercises were helpful.  I managed to stay home until my contractions were 2 minutes apart and I was dilated 8 cm!  I honestly think it was because of the breathing techniques given in the book.  I only wish I had the opportunity to take the class and/or finish the book.
0525948023|5.0|This book is profound, timely, practical and inspiring. Think of it as a guide to awakening for humanity. Without getting religeous, this book provides a roadmap for those called to seek Truth. If you feel the need to go beyond the surface life, this book is designed as a pointer to ease your way. Excellent.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|After seeing the movie 4 times and playing the soundtrack quite a few times I realized the last two songs (Willie Nelson's I knew a man\\" and Rufus Wainwrights \\"the maker makes\\") continue the story of what Ennis would be feeling as moved forward through his life.   First off, he and Jack always called each other \\"friend\\" and their relationship began as friends first, also the song tells about his friend who died 1000 miles from home on a road, never hurt anyone, etc.   then the haunting Wainwright song (if you look at it as Ennis thinking) talks about what he has gone through to move on with his life.  In the movie he always talks very gently to his animals, you can see him thinking these various thoughts while he is working, later in his life, come along little dogies, etc.   Very beautiful if you can see it that way, which is how I believe it's intended.
6303020089|5.0|I might be extremely sarcastic about the role of the U.S. in the world, but I admit many American actors are unbelievably talented.  Harrison Ford is a brilliant performer, together with Roger Moore he's my favourite actor. A great movie, that's all I want to say.
6304806418|5.0|What can I tell? A number of my previous \\"moderately positive\\" stereotypes were smashed by this remarkable work. I loved Andrew L. Webber, though may be not all of his works equally ... I respected Alan Parker since \\"The Wall\\". I thought Madonna was \\"just a popstar\\", though - certainly - a very talented one... I thought that Antonio Banderas is just a good \\"action\\" actor... Yet with all due credits - I did not expect this... Personally, I \\"had a crash\\" on this movie... <br /> <br />Together, they made an Epic, a classic work going far beyond a specific (however important) page in Argentinian history, straight into the heart of someone born (like me) far away from this country. The scene, the script / lyrics, the music, the acting and voices of Madonna and Banderas - are really admirable. And together, they make you feel - wherever you are born & live - this story is (or at least may become) about YOUR OWN country, your own nation and people, your own love for it, your own part  in the Century XXth... This movie cannot be just \\"watched\\" on \\"enjoyed\\"- you really have to live through it... <br />  <br />My sinsere thanks to all who made this work of High Art.

B000AYEI5Y|5.0|This is the best CD I have bought in the past 15 years!  James Blunt is incredibly talented and so different than any other artist out there right now.  Every song is well written, deeply moving, and heart felt.  His voice has an edge to it that conveys intense emotions during the love songs and a fun-loving, playfulness during the more upbeat songs.  From the first song on this CD, you'll be hooked.  I definitely was.  The song YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL has to be the one of the best love songs (unrecuited love) of all times.  A \\"must-have\\" in your CD collection.
B000003S0I|5.0|What kind of guy would give this cd 1 star, he must be deaf. Im a 15 year old kid and i know more about music and art then he does, king crimson and yes and other early progbands are an inspiration to new great progbands, how dare anyone to disrespect music history. This album is great along with in the court of the crimson king, and in the wake poseidon, i highly recomend king crimson to music enthusiests and artists and people who love good creative music. King crimson is a great band, and if you havent listened to them or bought a cd yet i highly recomend them to anyone. Thanks for taking the time to read my review.
0894803123|4.0|This is an excellent ice cream cookbook for Ben & Jerry's lovers.  My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the ice cream bases feature uncooked eggs very often.  If you can find a very clean source of fresh local eggs that is fine, but for the rest of us, cooked bases are safer even though they lose an important element of flavor that the uncooked bases give a recipe.  There are even recipes for the 'mixins' that come in many of their ice creams.  Yum!
B000784WMW|4.0|I have seen several versions of this movie and this one goes along with the book the best.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I saw Johnny Cash bio pic Walk the Line a while ago and marveled how good Reese Witherspoon and particularly Joaquin Phoenix were singing the songs made famous by the man in black. I quickly purchased the soundtrack album, but after the first playing, I realized without their phenomenal acting to go along with it, their voices just didn't have the depth and quality of the originals. I went out and bought -Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison- and did some side by side comparisons. The contest was over after the first song - Folsom Prison Blues. Simply, Johnny can bring it! Full, rich, textured vocals, that pull a lot out of that song that an actor never could. I've probably listened to the complete album 10 times in the last months - it's pretty hard to get tired of.<br /><br />Lesson learned. See the movie, buy the man in black's cds!
B000003N8R|5.0|Just great jazz, and it's enough to tell about that. Coltarne, Tyner, Garrison & Jones give you a piece of music you cannot forget. You love jazz, you love it.
B000002KB8|5.0|Black Sabbath is cool, but I hesitated for a while to buy this album because the cover looks like a paint by numbers done by Satan. Still, the music is great if you can get past the pure evil of the album art. The second track, \\"The Wizard,\\" explodes out of your stereo. But back to the cover.... I think the Salem witches got together and designed it after a long night of eating children and casting spells over ye olde townes people. I mean, I know Ozzy was in on the joke (I think), but the cover of BS totally f***ing creeps me out!!!! I didn't buy this album for a while for the same reason I don't own the Exorcist. I think the Exorcist is the scariest movie ever, but if I have it in my home, strange things might happen. I feared the same might become of me were I to own this album. One minute I'm hitting the repeat button on N.I.B., the next minute I'm spewing pea green vomit all over the walls and my divorced alcoholic mom is calling a young Jesuit over for coffee and a free consultation. There's too much evil in the world as it is. I don't need it on my turntable, too. The Paranoid cover with the guy with the sword isn't quite as spooky. I own that one. And Ozzy's solo covers were kind of scary when I was, like, 10. But now they look like what they were: carnival hamming by a circus geek. Rob Zombie, are you listening?
B00005S6K6|5.0|This film apparently went completely un-noticed at the time it was made.  To watch it now obviously done early in their careers is such a confirmation of their amazing talent (both Robert DeNiro and Meryl Street).  Their ability to \\"inhabit\\" the characters is truly miraculous.  So much is communicated by them to each other with few words that it is absolutely fascinating. <br />As artists they both seem to know each other so well and \\"play off\\" of one another with such \\"ease\\" that it is truly unbelievable that they didn't make more films together. <br />Everytime I watch this film and it has been many; I am completely caught up in it again like I'm seeing it for the first time.  That's why it's a complete \\"treasure\\" for anyone's DVD library.
0393327655|5.0|I've just finished reading this book and there is little that I can add to all of the positive reviews that have come before me. I agree with Mr. Harris on a good 90% of his arguments.  <br /> <br />What I really want to comment on are some of the negative reviews that I've read on this site. It appears to me that most of those who have taken exception to this book have not read it, despite their assertions to the contrary. For instance, there is the fellow who claims that because Sam Harris is a Jew he has gone lightly on the Jews. I do not know anything about Harris' background, but after reading this book I can assure you that he is as critical of the Old Testament as he is of any faith-based dogma or tribal religion. His criticisms of myth and superstition and wishful thinking masquerading as truth knows no boundaries. He takes equal aim at End-Time yearning Christians, paradise-seeking Moslems, knife-wielding, pantheistic Hindus, as well as Jews who believe that the Bible is a legally binding document with a land title appended to it.   <br /> <br />As for the other critics, their 'arguments' all boil to one thing: they don't like having their beliefs attacked and they resent the fact that such a book even exists.  <br /> <br />Harris' overriding concern is for the survival of civilization, and to a lesser extent the human species. I couldn't agree more with his analysis of the danger. Those of us who believe in reason, logic and proof have been slow to realize one chilling fact: we are considered the Enemy by all of those \\"good' people with holy books tucked under their arms. It doesn't matter if they are fundies or moderates, in the end they want us all to become believers and they will punish us for resisting. We need to respond to their coercive tactics with a call to arms, both figuritively, and perhaps literally, before we find ourselves blamed for all that is wrong with the world.   <br /> <br />This may be the 21st century, but all you have to do is flip the digits to know what century most of these people are living in. They seem to believe that if you hold up a Bible you can stop a hurricane. We've seen how much good that kind of thinking has gotten us.  <br /> <br />
1416905014|5.0|I bought this book for my 3 year old, and she absolutely loves it. It's a great book, because it's easy to read, and doesn't have a lot of text for 3-4 year olds.  My daughter loves looking at the pop ups when we read it.  It's so different from all the regular pop-ups, because of how much detail is included in this book.  We loved this book so much, that we got it as a birthday gift for her friends who are turning 4.  They are all into cinderella and princess parties now.
B000784WMW|5.0|I really liked this movie because it pretty much follows the plot of the book. I didn't really like how they de-emphasized Jane's relationship with Helen Burns or that it was more like a play in some aspects than a dramatic movie. Although, it is 5 hours long, it does follow the plot more than any other movie I've seen and was a great representation of Jane Eyre. Also, the actors and actresses looked and acted like Bronte described. I think Charlette Bronte would be proud of this film!
B0000074NU|4.0|As I listened to this 16 track compilation, I noticed at just how many of these tunes I didn't know by name, but I recognized them by their riffs. 'Best Of UFO: Gold Collection' gathers some of the British metal band's better known material from (I'm guessing) 1974-83. Cuts I was digging the most were \\"Doctor Doctor\\", \\"Only You Can Rock Me\\" (so they're the ones who originally did this song) \\"Shoot Shoot\\", \\"Rock Bottom\\", \\"Hot 'N Ready\\" and \\"Young Blood\\". Worthy of many repeated plays and a true keeper. Recommended.
B00005YU1O|5.0|It is great for instructional purposes-- a nice overview of various philosophical standpoints.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Come on people Pink Floyd is the greatest psycedelic rock band in history, so just quit your whining and wait a couple of months. Besides seriously folks \\"Pulse\\" is a great concert but come on no Roger Waters? Even that was the closest they could muster for their fans. Gilmour and Waters should just get wasted some night, get over there differences and realize that there music is about their fans. And for gods sake either tour soon again or fans like myself will have never gotten the chance to see a living legend. But if another tour really is out of the question, how about one of those DVDs of all live footage live Zeppelin's How the West Was One, that sounds comperable.
B00000IL1K|5.0|This is a stunning, stunning cd.  I love Sarah Brightman and she is amazing in this cd especially.  I love Eden the best out of all her music.  Her voice is unique and beautiful and the songs are stunning and haunting.  There are some fantastic songs here, but my stand out favourite ones are So Many Things, Dust In The Wind and the haunting Deliver Me.  Even if you aren't a fan of operetic voices, she is one of a kind.  This is not normally my type of music, but like I said, you have to hear this to beleive it.  You might surprise yourself and finding yourself liking this too.
6304696566|5.0|This movie, one of John Ford's favorites, encompasses all of the grandeur of the west.  It has been transposed to the DVD in a grand style, losing nothing of the screen version.  The cast was well chosen and captures the flavor of the times.  If you are a John Wayne fan you will recognize the cast with some new additions... many who went on to stardom in other arenas.  Jeffery Hunter and Natalie Wood are especially appealing and Ford regulars are right on the money.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have been waiting for an album like this for a long time.  It is nice to get away from all the stream-line pop music that is out there right now.  I wouldn't consider this disco at all--when I think of disco I think of the Bee-gee's, this is not a long those lines at all.  This is up-beat club dancing music--which again I say that I have been waiting for.  You can turn this on and just start dancing.  I really liked everyone song--I could do with out \\"I love New York\\"  Definately an album to buy, I don't think anyone that loves the club-type music could go with out this album in their collection. <br /> <br />
B000059HB7|5.0|I love this movie.  It has been made many other times, with some of the same people (cast) but this cast is by far, in my opinion, the best.  My husband can watch a John Wayne movie every night and not tire of them.  This is one I do not mind joining him for.  Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin are the twist's that are not uncommon in the 1950's westerns.  They work and so do the rest of the cast. The Martin/Nelson music is a nice addition... at least from my standpoint.
B00006D295|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies ever made!!!<br /><br />It's funny, creative, and the songs kick ass!!

B00005JO20|5.0|And Lo, The beast looked into the eyes of beauty, and Beauty stayed his hand.And from that day forward, he was as one dead. <br /> <br />this was the BEST movie i have EVER seen! i was very surprised. after seeing the first King Kong i doubted that this would be good. but boy how wrong i was. I found my self crying and applauding at the end. The actors all do very well and the graphics are great. the music is also something to look forward to. i was disappointed that the soundtrack did NOT have all of the songs on it! I do not know if there will be an extended coming out, but if it does it will  be December 31. one scene in the movie, the insect scene was said to be cut out in the old version because it made test audiences vomit. just think of what would happen if they saw this one! In the theater i remember watching many people race out of the theater and hide in the bathroom for that scene. I do not find it that bad and most movie fans will not. but if you hate bugs, skip the scene. one thing that i do love about the movie is that Kong has a heart. And anne does too. in the old one, all you saw was a large monster and a screaming girl. not in this one. the Central Park scene, for some reason made me cry. yep. mainly because people like me get attached to movie characters and are sad to see them go. I DO know that there are some scenes cut. they will probally make an extended to put them in, because i see that on the special features there ARE no deleted scenes. the Piranadohn and some other movie making scenes are NOT there.  this version is cheaper so if you dont really care about that then ok.  Andy Serkis is a GREAT character in it. he plays Kong and the cook Lumpy, who regrettably has a bad death, both i mean not just Lumpy. so i would say, if you are debating what to buy, get this! it is the best and i am sad that there are only 5 stars because it needs a 10. music and all. the music is the best part though. but, Carl's eyebrows are pretty cool too. lol.
B000002UAR|5.0|I purchased this album after borrowing a friends copy, and it is a must have. I always hear of the praise that people give to the Beatles White Album and Sgt. Peppers, however I have both of those albums also and I do not think that as a whole they are as good as the Revolver album. There is not a bad song on this album, It is just excelent song after excelent song. I just do not think that Yellow Submarine belongs on this particular album. This is an absolute must have.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|One of the best albums your gonna find out on the market. 100 times better than Mezmorize which was flat and honestly kind of boring. \\"Attack\\" sets the tone for this amazing piece of work which continues right along with the \\"Arials\\" like \\"Holy Mountains\\". A beautiful song which truly represents what makes SOAD so great. \\"Lonely Day\\" is an underrated sad song which almost brought me to tears first time i heard it. Daron obviously does not have the vocal strength of Serj, few do, but on \\"Lonely Day\\" he really stands out. When Mezmorize came out i was so bummed because i figured Hypnotize would be pretty much the same outing. Boy was i wrong, again this is SOADs second best behind Toxicity and slightly ahead of thier self titled Debut.
0060930349|5.0|I had to read this book for my college US history class. This is the most interesting history book I have ever read. Besides making a good college text, this book would also be a fun read as it is written like good literature. True he does go on and on about how good the North American weather is, but I say this is only natural for a British Chap :) It is this incredible insight and depth that never gets bogged down that is one of the strong points of the book.  <br /> <br />A History of the American People reads a bit like Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America in that it is a European that is just fascinated by our experiment in republican self-government.
B00007E8V4|5.0|First off I am a huge SOAD fan and have loved every one of their albums with one big exception. That being Mezmorize, which I thought lacked everything that makes these guys what they are. Now Steal this Album is not B-sides as some claim it to be. In fact it has two of SOADs best songs. Those being \\"Mr. Jack\\" and the amazing \\"Streamline\\". Any song that shows off Serj's godlike voice like these two do is a winner in my opinion. The last part of \\"Mr. Jack\\" is absolutely brilliant. Now there are just a few rather forgettable songs on this album as there are on almost any album, except for Toxicity where every song was a gem. But overall if you are even the slightest SOAD fan you must have this album in your collection. I only hope SOAD keeps on pumping out the albums and that Serj keeps it strong on the vocals instead of the underrated yet overmatched Daron.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|The film is fantastic on many levels- King Kong looks amazing. I am not so sure about the casting especially Jack Black who I normally love. Kept feeling like he was on the verge of being comical. But what lost me were the long chase scenes with the dinosaurs. Too much too long.
1565114205|3.0|A lot of good thought provoking information is presented in this book.  Old ideas are studied and evaluated for their effectiveness when selling big ticket items.  Even if you are in a small ticket market you will pick up something that may be useful in your next sales call. <br /> <br />I like the book on CD because it makes \\"productive use\\" of drive and fly time.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I was so thrilled with this movie. I actually knew nothing about Mr. Cash's life before the film and was rivited at the story. The acting is sensation. I can't believe how well they both sang their parts. Excellent!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|O.K. technicaly its a chick flick. But wow what a film.  It was released in theaters around the same time as Sense and Sensibility.  As a result it was over looked when it came out. Amazing acting. An  interpersonal subtlety rarely seen in films.  We're too buisy with special  affects extravaganzas. This is packed with psychological action! I think it is the best Jane Austin adaptation out there. Its very physicaly realistic to the time period. If you liked other Jane Austin Adaptations you should love this.
B00005JM02|5.0|This film was a complete 10 on every level. I loved it! And Ellen was hysterical.

B0000AYL17|3.0|i ve just been listening to my copy of gaucho on dvd audio for the first time on a proper kick off 5.1 system, and jeez what a shock, reading how  everybody seems to think this is one of the best 5,1 mixes they have heard. well unless saud is a different mix to the dvd, then i must say it is shocking , ok the stereo mix sounds excellent but the 5.1 remix has decided to remove the brecker brothers horns and all manner of backing vocals and odds and sods, on the brilliant hey nineteen donald fagens vocal is so exposed he sounds like a out of tune neil young on helium. for goodness sake what the hell were they thinking. .FACT.. the original vinyl mastering is by far the best sounding version i have ever heard, warm clean , fat loud crisp every thing music should sound like, so stop kidding yourselves, just because something you are familiar with,but maybe a little bored of suddenly sounds open and fresh it don t mean it sounds better.........i give this item 3 stars for the warm stereo mix only.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This movie catches you at the first moment and it lasts the whole film. The singing is excellent and the artistic direction is great. Loved the actors as well. I was much more enthralled with the film than with the actual live production.
B000003TAW|5.0|Sure, the blue album was only Weezer's first album, but who says the first album cannot be the best? It was my first Weezer album and it opened my eyes to just how much I was missing. I realize that I may sound a bit obssesive, but i already know this about myself. Getting back to the album, it is full of gems, from its hits like Buddy Holly to songs that are just plain classic such as Surf Wax America. I cannot explain to you the total greatnes of this album, so all I have left to say is buy it to see for yourself.
0486408434|5.0|This is the must have classic of card magic. I bought this book in 1978 and studied it religiously. This is the book to have if you are serious about mastering the skills of card magic that will make others beleive that you have real powers. This book takes you through all the basics of card control and helps you apply them to the tricks that will astound your audience and make them believe that you are a real master of the art of card magic. This is the book to get and master.
B000002KDM|2.0|I purchased this CD for a friend that does not have or know how to use a computer. After receiving this CD I did listen to it and did not care for it but it does not matter if I liked it or not since it was for somone else.
B00005221M|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this movie is one of the greatest pieces of cinematography. That being said, I won't give a synopsis of this movie.  There are numerous other reviews that go into that. What I would like to comment on is the Director's Expanded Edition versus the Original Theatrical Release. Like other reviewers here, I too at first was disappointed with the Expanded Edition, simply because of some material cut from the original, most notable for me, the Clannad's, \\"I Will Find You\\" song that accompanies Hawkeye, Chingachgook & Uncas as they begin their journey to rescue the Munro sisters. And yes some of Hawkeye's most quoted lines are also gone, \\"Nothing better to do on the lake today, Major?\\" \\" Clear it up any?\\" \\"Just dropped in to see how you boys is doing!\\" \\"Someday you & I are going to have a serious disagreement!\\", all have been edited out.    On the positive side though, I found that the Expanded Edition is not nearly as bad as other people have made it out to be.  In fact, after you watch it a couple times you really don't miss what was edited out all that much. Other reviewers have said that the additional footage does not add anything to the movie, or that this new edition destroys the flow & continuity of the original. I do not agree. On the contrary,these subtle changes and additions make for a more complete and fleshed out version of  LOTM's. This in turn ADDS to the flow & continuity of the original. Take for instance the diversionary scene made by Major Heyward to enable the courier to flee to safety under the cover of Hawkeye and Uncas.This additional footage to me adds much to the movie, it not only shows us how the diversion was made for the courier to escape, but also adds another dimension to Major Heyward by portraying  him as a brave warrior. Some new scenes of the siege on Fort William Henry are also added, which are not only spectacular to watch, (especially if you're viewing them on a big screen home theater system as I am),but also shows that the group trying to enter the fort takes more time to do so then just simply arriving and walking in. In the end, Chingachgook's added words poignantly foreseeing  the future, is something that many Native American Indians were thinking at that time. It was fitting that this additional footage was edited back in. Even the Clannad's \\"I Will Find You\\" scene is not that bad if given half a chance. With almost thirty seconds of additional footage here, we get more of a sense of desperation as we hear pants of exhaustion from Hawkeye, Chingachgook & Uncas as they pursue the Huron War party.   This scene by the way is accompanied by the Trevor Jones/Randy Edelman score and does not come across as an awkward scene added in with  no musical score, as noted by another reviewer.   In fact, I found no additional scenes that were out of place for lack of an accompanying musical score.     Aside from the above mentioned, there are at least a dozen more scenes with additional footage not seen in the orginal theatrical release. If you're interested, you can view them at the \\"The Internet Movie Database\\" found on Amazon's website. Just click on alternate versions.    So what do we get with this Expanded Edition DVD? Well, aside from a stunning anamorphic widescreen transfer that renders crystal clear clarity and deep rich colors, accompanied by DTS Surround Sound that will simply amaze you, we get  Michael Mann's true vision of how his movie was meant to be. And who would be more qualified to do this than the man responsible for giving us this gem of a movie in the first place?  But don't take somebody else's word for it, go out and pick up a copy of the Expanded Edition and check it out for yourself.  If you love this movie as much as I do, the $7.47 price tag from Amazon is a small price to pay (actually a steal!), and in the end you may find that it's not as bad as you have been led to believe. I know it wasn't for me.    I would also like to note as a previous reviewer has, you can obtain the original version on DVD simply by ordering it from Amazon.Co.UK. But you will need a regionless player to view it.  If you no not have a regionless DVD player you may still be able to view it on your computer. My computer automatically recognized it as a Region 2 DVD and played it no problem. This way you can have both versions on DVD and the best of both worlds.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best price that I could find!!!  I received it sooner than expected and have been enjoying it!  THanks!
0393317552|5.0|I'll try not to be a blowhard by unnecessarily recapitulating the views expressed by other reviewers.  In short, the book presents a logical and reasonable thesis and backs it up very well.  The objections of other reviewers are nothing more than quibbles; yes, there may be some situations where other variables take precedence over those listed as primary in the book, but the conceptual framework laid out by Dr. Diamond is an extremely useful model that successful explains most of the large scale variation seen.  An old scientific adage is \\"All models are wrong, but some are more useful than others.\\"  While Dr. Diamond's model certainly isn't infallible, it seems to be the best model availible by a wide margin.
0739313126|4.0|In general, I liked this audio book very much.  I began listening to it on my way back home from a trip to vegas.  However, I was only about 1/2 done when I arrived.  So, I found myself driving the long route back and forth to work so that I got to listen to more of it on the drive.<br /><br />About the time I got back home, there was an online news story about Opus Dei, and how that organization wasn't terribly happy about this book because it talks about them in a way I guess they feel was unflattering.  I found this interesting, since prior to that I didn't even know Opus Dei was real!  This only increased my eagerness to listen to the book, since I like stories that have roots in reality.  I have absolutely no knowledge of biblical figures or stories, so until this point, I had no inkling that the story was anything other than total fantasy.  I guess that it still could be.  I do know, however, that as I described the plot to a good friend who is very religious, he scoffed at the storyline.  I wonder if people who are heavy into Christianity and biblical lore will be able to listen to (or read) this book and enjoy it for the fictional story that it is?<br /><br />There were a few twists that I didn't see coming, and a few that I did.  The ending was OK but left a few minor details, in my opionion, unfinished.  And Dan Brown obviously knows nothing about firearms, because if he did, he'd know that Glock pistols do not have a safety lever.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to others.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I remember hearing Johnny Cash's sad, aching voice often during my childhood but hadn't bothered to seek him out in my adult years.  Until, while waiting for an appointment, I heard his remake of NIN's \\"I Hurt.\\"  I sat and listened to this painfully sad song while trying to remember its original incarnation as a Nine Inch Nails shoutfest.  The two could not be compared!<br /><br />After seeing \\"Man In Black\\" and singing along to most of the songs in the movie, I was inspired to purchase several Cash CD's including this one.  I cannot even begin to articulate how incredibly moving it is.  Although the man is a legend and has produced a mass of hits, this may well be his siren song; one that should rekindle that strange appreciation for a storyteller with a pain-filled voice that breaks your heart and brings a tear to your eye.<br /><br />Every song surprises the listener with a newfound perspective!  Classics that were accepted at face value suddenly begin to resonate with a proufound sadness that they'd only touched on when previously recorded by other artists.<br /><br />The man in black pulled off a final coup immediately before his death by reminding the world that a beautiful and perfectly pitched voice is not required to produce something exceptional.  The man himself was something exceptional.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|I've always wondered why a band, who took their cue from the 80's rock group The Jesus and Mary Chain, would name themselves after Marlon Brando's gang in the 1953 film The Wild One. I don't recommend judging a book by its cover but judging by B.R.M.C.'s name I would have expected something along the lines of The Raveonettes. If they're going to name their group after a fictitious gang I would suggest The Lords of Hell (on a side note, you have to give props to a family film that keeps the line, \\"Don't f*** with the Lords of Hell). On B.R.M.C.'s latest they take their sound back to the roots of rock and up the folk and country influences, but at its heart it sounds like 1950's rock `n roll-well, with 50 years of musical evolution having more than a little influence. <br /> <br />B.R.M.C. came out of the gates with a ridiculous amount of hype (it was probably New Music Express). They were just asking for a smack down. When their solid debut album came out plenty of critics dismissed them as Jesus and Mary Chain rip-offs (fair enough) and then declared B.R.M.C. were juvenile delinquents who would amount to nothing (a little harsh I thought). When B.R.M.C.'s follow up, Take Them On, On Your Own, was a little sophomore slumpish you could hear bones splintering around the world as critics collectively broke their arms while patting themselves on the back. Things only got worse when B.R.M.C. were dropped from their label. To top it all off an ex-girlfriend stole their dog and showed up at a show only to make out with every guy there. <br /> <br />Down but not out, the B.R.M.C. have return with a triumphant left hook. Howl isn't a return to form, it's a complete reinvention. The Jesus and Mary Chain posturing is downplayed while folk, country, and gospel are embraced. The sounds conjure up the dustbowl west complete with lone churches set against a flat landscape. It's hard to tell whether the incantations of religion are sincere or merely dressing for the new sound, but in the end I don't think it matters much. Even if the album is style over substance, they have enough style so that it doesn't matter. For a band to do a complete overhaul like this is impressive to say the least. I hope the attention Howl is getting will force those critics who dismissed B.R.M.C. to take another look. <br /> <br />I read that the title of the album, Howl, is a reference to the Allen Ginsburg poem of the same name. I don't really see much of a connection. \\"Howl\\" the poem is loaded with urban imagery that Ginsburg seems so intent on railing against. At one point he intones \\"Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets,\\" likening the urban landscape to the Old Testament idol the unfaithful worshiped. Despite Ginsburg's distaste for concrete surroundings, his poem has its feet firmly planted in a city if only to condemn it. Ginsburg's \\"Howl\\" strikes me as a Jeremiad pointing to a new way of life in an increasingly conservative America. B.R.M.C. are much closer to On the Road, the novel that follows Kerouac's persona as he crisscrosses the country as if he was running from his Bible-black Catholic roots. It has the same grand sense of movement and a tortured sense of religion that would ultimately consume Kerouac just like his alcoholism. <br /> <br />My three favorite tracks: \\"Howl,\\" \\"Ain't No Easy Way,\\" and \\"Sympathetic Noose.\\" Despite the organ, the title track sounds as if it has one foot dipped in B.M.R.C.'s last two albums (come to think of it, \\"Salvation\\" could probably have gone on this album with no problems). \\"Ain't No Easy Way\\"-the obvious single-is a taunt song that ruminates on how it's much easier to fall into love than to completely escape it. \\"Sympathetic Noose\\" makes great use of studio trickery. The song starts with the strumming of a raw sounding acoustic guitar only to have it backed by a percussion section that can only be produced by modern day electronics. It's a great dichotomy, and in my opinion the best moment on the CD. <br /> <br />The B.M.R.C. have tossed off their leather jackets, gave their old label the finger, and completely revamped their sound. After listening to this album you might be asking yourself, \\"What are they rebelling against?\\" B.R.M.C. would pointedly shoot back, \\"Whaddya got?\\"  <br />
B0000AQS0F|3.0|Buffy the Vampire Slayer is my favorite show ever made. Despite that, I never watched Firefly when it was on TV. I just didn't want to get into another bunch of characters. Now that I'm finally \\"over\\" Buffy, I rented Serenity after hearing such good things about it. I absolutely loved it, so then I bought this set so I could see what the show was all about.  <br /> <br />I have to say the series itself isn't all that great. Some of the stories are very weak, and a lot of it is downright embarrassing to watch with other people around. That said, I love the characters, and the movie Serenity showed the kind of potential this show had. The idea of a western sci-fi is pretty silly, but Joss pulled it off in the best fashion possible and somehow made it easy to suspend belief enough to enjoy the concept.  <br /> <br />I know that if Joss had the time he needed to really develop the characters and come up with some more interesting storylines, the show could've been up there with Buffy in terms of quality. Buffy was often silly and trivial during its first season; it wasn't until season 2 that it really became interesting.  <br /> <br />Even though it's not great, I'm happy I bought this set and would recommend it to anyone who liked Serenity and is interested in seeing where these characters came from. I know that I hardly got what any of the characters were about just from the movie - Kaylee meant nothing to me, I had no idea Zoe and Wash were married, Shephard was just a random guy on a planet that they cared about, Inara was a random woman on another planet, and River was the star.  <br /> <br />It's interesting that most of the characters are of completely opposite importance in the show - River barely has a chance to do anything but babble crazily for a couple brief scenes every episode. I can imagine what Joss had in mind for her if he'd had more chance for the series; instead of having her suddenly start kicking butt for two hours, her powers would've been revealed more subtlely. Ah, well. <br /> <br />It's a shame this show didn't get more time to mature. But I'd love to see a Serenity 2.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The music in this soundtrack is almost beyond description.  <br />It takes me back to times way before I was born. Yet, it grabs hold and I can feel how those days were. It takes me there.  <br /> <br />Absolutely one of America's South lands wonderful contributions to folk music!
B00005MKA3|5.0|As u can tell by my handle I like Marley's \\"Uprising\\" alot, but i've listened to each one of his albums so many times, it's hard to pick a favorite, so my favorite Wailers album changes often.   <br /> <br />     I really like this one because the album starts off with two heavy hitters back to back.  I like Marley's use of ska in \\"top rankin'\\" and \\"survival.\\"  \\"Babylon System\\" once again shows Marley's ingenious lyrical prowess which brilliantly sheds light on greed and decadence in contemporary society.  <br /> <br />     And Bob Marley wouldn't be Bob Marley without using his lyrical ability to lift the spirits of the downtrodden in songs like \\"survival,\\" \\"one drop,\\" \\"ride natty ride\\" and \\"wake up and live.\\"  The fact that so many songs exude a confident perseverance leaves you feeling at peace with yourself and the world around you despite the corruption of some.  In the latest remaster of \\"Survival,\\" the producers made a fantastic decision by putting a longer alternate version of \\"ride natty ride.\\"  This song is one of the most spiritually uplifting tracks in all of Marley's repertiore.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw Phantom live a couple weeks before I watched the movie and I think anyone who enjoyed the live show will enjoy the movie.
B000001E18|5.0|This album just barely edges out \\"unforgettable fire\\" for the best u2 album.  U2 has been known to create conspicuous anthem-rockers like \\"where the streets have no name,\\" \\"sunday bloody sunday,\\" and \\"pride (in the name of love).\\"  This album flies under the radar.  If you are looking for an album containing alot of ambiguity, ambivalence and beauty, you must check this album out. In a nutshell \\"lemon\\" encompasses all of the adjectives i used to describe this album, most of all the beauty.  This song is one of my all-time favorites.  I prefer lyrics by bono that are less preachy and more subtle which allows for more lyrical play (like \\"babyface\\").        <br /> <br />     Musically, this album is really hard to classify.  It has an industrial feel in \\"numb\\" and \\"daddy's gonna pay...\\"; a dance floor feel in \\"lemon\\"; a classical feel in \\"the first time\\"; and an otherworldly feel in \\"zooropa\\" and \\"the wanderer.\\"  But this inability to classify it musically matches the ambiguous lyrical themes throughout the album.  Checka check it out.
0060578793|5.0|I purchased this book to go into my family's emergency preparedness kit. This is a reference book to have when you consider the fact that the earth is now 9 degrees off its normal axis, recent climate change, and other natural disasters. Let's not forget the man maid disasters as well.<br /><br />I am also planning a camping trip. After reading ths book, I am now more confident that I can take survive in the wilderness alone.<br /><br />This book covers 1st aid, shelter, fire starting, food and water needs also. This book reminds me of a 1950's Boy Scout Handbook I once owned.Good Stuff
B00003CWLF|5.0|Anna and the King is a colorful and generally touching version of the English teacher's unusual relationship with the King of Siam.  Chow Yun-Fat is superb and very credible as the King.  Comparisons to the older version with Yul Brinner and Deborah Kerr are difficult to make, since this interpretation seems like a different story entirely.
B0001I562I|5.0|This movie left such a positive impression on my daughter when she was little that now even though she is 23 years old she asked for the dvd as a Christmas gift!
B0001I55OC|5.0|I loved watching this movie.  The setting started in the archeological dig of a 14th century castle and then the characters, through a scientific experiment,(not given away the plot) move through time and come face to face with the same castle and all the problems that faced the people of long ago.  The characters think that because their from the future it will be easy to overcome the middle ages. WRONG!  It still takes team work and know how to develop a plan that gets them out of some hot and sometimes 'tight' spots.  The love theme of finding your place with someone you love was excellent as two people, each from a different time, come together and make their own history.  Evidence is discovered that unlocks these two peoples history near the end of the movie as the other characters realize their devotion to each other. Over all, one character Chris Johnston played by Paul Walker is searching for his father Professor Edward Johsnton, while seeking the affections of a perticular young lady and trying to keep her safe.  The character of Marek also finds a cause that he champions and knowing what history has written decides to change it.  Will he succeed?  The Assistant Professor Andra Marek played by Gerard Butler also provides a wonderful performance as he guides them through history and shows Paul's character that we can make our own history.

B0007TKNII|5.0|Widescreen is so much better than the full screen.  It's like viewing it in the theatre.  You miss none of the subtle nuisances found in the background.   <br />    The 2 disc version is the best.  Loved the cut musical number and the behind scenes of this beautiful movie.
B000002AZ8|4.0|This is an essential Pearl Jam. If you want to see the bridge between the old Pearl Jam and the new Pearl Jam, this is it. This is when their sound began to get more lo-fi and punky. Not quite as loud and rockin' as Ten, but a little bit better than Vs. Still makes you want to get up and revolt.
B00000GAIW|5.0|This was Ian Anderson's finest hour.  Tull has certainly recorded some great songs besides the ones on Aqualung but this concept album was the best compilation that they achieved.  It had a perfect flow.  I became a huge fan and bought all of their music after hearing the words and feeling the energy on this album back in the day.  I have been to just about every one of their live appearances in my area and they are still one of the greatest, underappreciated music makers out there.  The only problem that I have had for years was that on the original Chrysalis album, they end the music with Wind Up.  That was where it should have always ended!  I would love to see a CD that mirrored the original album.  The additional songs are good songs but do not fit in with the flow of the album. They are just add-ons that accomplish nothing but destroying the experience of what the genius of Ian Anderson provided in the original format.  Wind Up completed the theme of that great work and Wind Up meant what it said.  Whoever the marketing knucklehead was that added songs after that missed the point.

0060755598|4.0|E-Myth Revisited CD is a great audio book.  For those of you that have a small business that is in trouble, this book is for you.  Gerber gives some real insight into what it takes to successfuly grow a business.  You have to put together systems that work every time.  Run your small business like a large business.  Spend time working on your business rather than in it.  An important concept that Gerber talks about is this:  The product of your business is not what you sell, it's how your customers feel after doing business with you.  I really enjoyed this book and have recommended it to others.  It could have been a little shorter, but still very good.
0393327655|5.0|This book was brilliant, just brilliant and incredibly brave. As for the clowns who whined that it was written by a jew, (unbelievable) or that it was \\"fascist\\", or that the author didn't take into account the difference twixt Lutheran and Baptist or what have you: Shut up. (...) (...)Spirituality is a necessary aspect of the human condition, at least for most. (Read 'The Power of Now', that takes a brain and some courage, too). But organized religion is a viral poison of the human psyche. Got a bible? From ANY religion? Use those silky, onion-skin pages as a reason to skip the toilet-paper this month. This is a BRAVE book, written by a very courageous writer at a time when the world seems to be losing it's collective mind. Da-da's not up in the sky, peeping at you and pulling strings, you sad, stupid, destructive morons. Stop being afraid of your own pee-pees and so concerned with what poorly written legends & folklore say and WAKE UP and take some f-ing responsibility for your lives. The worst thing about this book? It might be too late. Watch the evening news and count the pinheads currently affecting our lives with their ridiculous CRAP.      Organized, dogmatic religion is for the frightened and the WEAK. Time to grow up, or hand the reins to those of us who aren't dangerously deluded, you frightened, foolish goons.

B00006RCNW|5.0|I like cop shows in general. I have been watching them since I was a kid. This one is by far the best I have seen. I have watched seasons 1-3 so far and cannot wait for the rest. This is not just another cop show. You get attached to the characters quickly, despite their many moral flaws. Also, the storyline changes in unexpected ways so each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat. Highly addictive. <br /> <br />One word of caution, this is for adults only. Watch only when the kids (even teens) are not around. This is vulgar, violent and sexually explicit.
1592400876|5.0|Ah, geez, I loved it.  If you can't identify with the following quote (and find the humor in it), don't torment yourself by reading this book.  \\"If [this] satanic sprinkling of redundant apostrophes causes no little gasp of horror or quickening of the pulse, you should probably put down this book at once.\\"  So, of course I loved it.  In the first few lines of the Introduction, she hit upon one of my pet peeves - the idiotic tendency of 'some people' to create plurals by adding an apostrophe-s.<br /><br />My punctuation instincts are pretty good already, but did I learn anything?  Absolutely!  And I laughed all the while.

6303257801|3.0|I agree on most Black and White movies Colorization is a bad idea. But in the case of Kong I make a exception. In many cases the color enhances the wonderful \\"matte backrounds\\" of Skull Island and of New York City. Still I do believe that is not the best \\"Colorization\\" that could have been done. I do take two rating points away because of the use of pastel Colors and a slightly less sharp focus. Viewing it you will notice small details that you would never see in the original.  I do want to make clear I see this as \\"only a supplement\\" to the Black and White film rather than a replacement. And prehaps as a versions of the film that those who \\"hate\\" Black and White images can enjoy.

B0009ZHJ7S|3.0|Robots, taking the cue from the current animation trend, is yet another 3D animated feature from Dreamworks, who also made Ice Age. And, like trends, this style of animation is starting to get old, already. Though it's possible to do anything with this type of animation (see the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Advent Children) this movie was just the same old. While the story was fun, and the voice-acting excellent, little in this movie is unique.<br /><br />The story itself follows a young Robot named Rodney who has a dream of becoming a great robot inventor. Though he wants to do this for himself, he also wants to make his parents proud at the same time. Problem is, he's a spare-parts kind of robot, and can't get into the place where his dreams can be obtained, and where shiny, new-age robots dwell. He isn't deterred, and goes on a quest to find his mentor who Rodney believes can help him. Along for the ride is a cast of rusty robots, led by Fender, voiced by Robin Williams, definitely the comic relief.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of funny moments in it, and a few stabs at pop-culture, but beyond that nothing in this movie needs to be seen. Robots should have taken the cue from Shrek or The Incredibles and attempted to make something more than just the average, 3D animated feature.
B000683VI4|5.0|Everybody said it is a very good movie, I bought it, I watch it and I totally agreed. It is one of the greatest love story ever told, simple yet romantic. It is hard to say it has a sad ending or a happy ending. It depends on one's points of view. It is sad that at the end she didn't even recognize him, it is happy that they were together till the end. DVD's picture and sound quality are excellent.
0345349571|5.0|Tuchman's command of the English language was legendary, and earned.  The tenor she holds from page 1 to the end is clear, distinct, and objective to a fault.  I first became aware of Tuchman from \\"The Guns of August\\"; this is only the second of her works that I've read thus far.  This book is so rich it almost floods your thoughts with images of the terrain, the various duchies, estates, and the primitive cities.  The machinations and intrigues executed by the nobles of the time, the arrogance and hubris of the so-called knights, and the struggles of the bourgeois class to thrive in spite of all the mishaps of the 14th century, are often so complex as to become bewildering.  When I finally finished the book, I felt as though I'd been through a wringer.  A classic story, told well, by a true master.
B0009QTS1M|3.0|i bought more than  $140 of dvd's movies from amazon and i buy them for my collections. all movies arrived well except two. one was \\"avant\\" that  dvd was not burned right, and the second one was gladiator that the dvd's inside the package were intact but the pacckage was busted in one corner like some one droped it or hit it, basically looked dammaged. For acollector that is disapointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. i hope amazon rectifies this.
0790729407|3.0|This is an educational film for todays youth who are not famliar with Michael Collins. A piece of Irish history worth watching
B0002XNSY0|5.0|A classic - the DVD extras are interesting, too bad we will never have a director's commentary that will run with the picture.
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden was the paragon of heavy metal in the 1980's. And this album, \\"Powerslave,\\" is generally regarded as their best work. \\"Powerslave\\" has the same complexity and richness as Maiden's previous album, \\"Piece of Mind.\\" And the songs cover a wide variety of topics, just like \\"Piece of Mind.\\" Both of these albums represented a huge departure from cliche satanic themes that were so prevalent at the time. but I believe \\"Powerslave\\" is an even better album than its predecessor because the melodies of the songs throughout the album are so varied. Some tunes, like \\"Aces High,\\" are loud and in your face. Others, such as \\"Powerslave,\\" are more subdued and haunting. \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" is similar to the Beatles' \\"A Day in the Life\\" with it's various tempo changes, broad range of sound, and dark subject matter.  <br /> <br />The albums that came after this seemed to try to imitate the complexity of \\"Powerslave\\" without the same soul behind them. The albums before it, while classic in their own right, can't compare to the musical ability demonstrated in this album.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album for any fan of 80's metal.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|When I went to see Pride and Prejudice, I fell in love with the music. It told the whole story itself and I had to buy it. \\"Liz on top of the world\\" is one of my favorite tracks. The beautiful music on the soundtrack really adds to the entire essence of the film.
B000002MJR|5.0|A lot of people seem to tend to shy away from live shows for a variety of reasons including lack of ambience (listening to it is nothing like being there), the band doesn't sound that great live (see ambience comment), too much crowd noise, missing a favorite song etc...This album, thankfully, fails in none of these categories.<br /><br />While the ambience of a cd will never match that of actually being there for the show, the producer of this live effort took the time to carefully bring the crowd in but not too much to take away from the music giving you a small feeling of being there.  The sound quality of the instruments and Mark Knopfler's voice is incredible.  They can just flat out play and this cd shows it.  Finally, the song line up is great and show cases much - if not all - of their best work.  I can't say this cd has everything for everyone but the line up of songs shouldn't leave anyone disappointed.<br /><br />Over all I highly this recommend this amazing cd and would also recommend the DVD version that goes along with it.
B00008DDHZ|2.0|I was dissapointed with this film, I bought it hoping to watch a very powerful movie about a piece of Irish history worth noting.
0345357116|5.0|For all who are genuinely interested in either mythology, Tolkein, or both, this provides another conversation with Professor Tolkein; another avenue for continuing the friendship which begun in reading his other works. Although he would not necessarily agree with the following statement, the more works one reads of an author, the more he understands him. This book is probably best for those who are truly seeking more of the world of Tolkein's Middle Earth, and all other readers will find it unsympathetic to passing whims of fast fantasy.

You DO have to persist to develop the new habits, though; it isn't magic.  I gave the book to several friends, one of whom is a perfectionist so wouldn't tackle anything she couldn't finish properly.  She had become so overwhelmed that depression was setting in; she says that the book \\"saved her life.\\"
067144901X|5.0|This book has been a favorite of my twins.  They started learning their animals and the sounds with this book.  It is easy to recite and fun.  We have read it so much, I can recite it without the book when things get touchy in the car or when we are out...it quiets them down immediately.  This is a must for anyone w/ soon to be toddlers.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|The version of this CD now being sold does NOT contain Darling Pretty anymore. <br />For some reason they removed that track, put Brothers in Arms on CD 2, and added Skateaway on CD 1. <br />Which sucks, because I really like Darling Pretty, and Skateaway isnt that great in my opinion.
1932100385|5.0|There is so much written on diet, one might be skeptical about another book on the subject, but the data gathered by the author in his own reseach as well as that of other highly respected scientists and medical doctors and the writing style make The China Study a compelling read. I have bought copies for family and dear friends; most have shifted their diets from animal products to plants products. You owe it to yourself and loved ones to seriously consider the information T. Colin Campbell provides.
B00097DX3U|4.0|I had to play this album a few times before I really appreciated it.  I guess I was looking for something more along the lines of their last album, and, while this one has music like that, it also has its own texture and feel to it that took me by surprise.  In the end, however, this album really grew on me.  \\"Be Yourself\\" is probably the most recognizable song on the CD as it was the only one to get much radio play (at least, where I live) and it's a good, catchy song.  As with their last CD, each song bleeds into the next, so that they're more like chapters in a book.  I appreciate this a lot more than CDs where each song is wildly different.  All in all, a good album that I'm happy with.
0671449028|5.0|This is a wonderful bedtime book.  My girls must read it almost every night and now are helping me recite it.  It is a must for any family that wants bedtime to be fun.
B0002B15XI|2.0|Maybe I just didn't see it when I purchased the movie, but I wasn't aware of the director's commentary throughout the movie.  It really detracted from the presentation.  Also his comments seemed almost off the cuff and didn't ahve a lot of forethought in them.  At anyrate, it might have been my error, but whatever, the commentary was bad.
B000002GYR|4.0|Tom Waits has always seemed an eclectic choice at best; his approach to life and to music always appeared a bit retro beatnik, but Closing Time has changed all that for me. These thoughtfully rendered songs come off as wistful and melancholy, and together this makes for fine listening. \\"Martha\\" is a touching song in particular, and for a man just beyond mid-life, I was moved by the regret so evident in Waits' voice. For that moment late at night, sitting at the computer and writing, no album can better this one.
B0006L16N8|4.0|This is pretty much more of the same from Coldplay - which is good or bad depending on what you were expecting.  It's not a new or different sound, but I wasn't looking for one here, so I'm happy with the CD.  If you're expecting something new, you'll probably be disappointed with this album.  If you just want something else to follow \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" then you'll love this.
B00005JKG9|5.0|What can I say? One of the best movies ever filmed in maybe one or two locations only. It's all dialogue, with a great cast. Alec Boldwin who? Oh my goodness! You see this movie and you tell yourself:\\"Where has this guy been?\\". His quasi-monologue it's a MUST see! I review it back and forth, I can never stop! I'll say no more! Just wacth it!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Easy transaction, quick shipping. Would definitely buy from again.  Thanks!!
B000AM6MKU|5.0|I will refrain from expressing how wonderful this movie is to watch because it is obvious. It has become a Christmas tradition for my family to see this film at the IMAX theater in 3-D (Highly Recommended). My little boy, however, was taken to a newer level with this film when I purchased this special gift set and let Santa deliver it to him on Christmas morning! He absolutely loved getting the movie, but what was indeed the icing on the cake was having the snow globe and wood train added to the DVD. Even after Christmas season was over and the movie was put away until next year, the snow globe and train remain by his bedside and he always looks at it before he goes to bed. <br /> <br />This gift set is just what Santa should be getting for all little boys and girls who are not only facinated with this movie but have a love for trains in general. If there could have been an improvement done for next year, it would be to replace either the snow globe or train with an actual replica of the silver bell that was on Santa's sleigh. Perhaps if this ends up being sold separately, I would purchase it. <br /> <br />Overall, this gift is a keeper!

It offers nothing less than a proven and documented way to fully immerse yourself in your chosen activity. Use of the princpals outlined in this classic book will make work more rewarding, art more passionate and interpersonal relationships more fulfilling. The author's name is the most challenging part of reading this book. His style is easy to read, but not condescending. I've read lots and lots of books and this one is unequalled. Csikszentmihalyi is not only a genius, but the more rare type of genius who can share what he knows, and what he knows can make a day and night difference in a person's life regardless of what that person's occupation is. Flow will turbocharge your life!

B000BB14YY|5.0|I was one of those unfortunates who actually purchased the \\"Masterworks Edition\\" DVD of \\"Ran.\\"  When the menu came up showing a scene from the movie, I thought perhaps I was seeing things.  \\"What happened to the grass?\\"  I asked myself.  I had remembered lush green grass in the film, but here the grass looked like a weak greenish brown.  I remember Kurosawa in a film once talking about how he always wanted his grass in his films to look lush and green.  I asked myself, \\"I wonder what Kurosawa would thing of this DVD?\\" <br />Looking through the film I realized that this was a poor transfer.  Perhaps the worst part of the DVD was the \\"restoration\\" demo, showing before and after shots.  The picture was notably sharper in the \\"after\\" shots, this is true, but also with a profound shift in the color and an overall desaturation.  Thus, the \\"before\\" shots showed blurred but lush green grass, which became sharply-focused but brownish grass.  In other shots, a blue sky was \\"restored\\" to a sort of rusty hue, while bright red banners were so desaturated they almost disappeared from view.  I even tried to tweak the picture with the settings on my television, but to no avail. <br />The \\"Masterworks Edition\\" restoration demo, as brief as it may have been, has to be one of the most irritating viewing experiences I have ever had. <br />When I recently came across \\"Ran\\" listed here on amazon.com, I read the reviews and realized that many people agreed with me.  I also realized I needed to get the Criterion Collection version.  I love Criterion and they have very high standards.  What a joy it was to pop my new DVD in the player and see \\"Ran\\" the way it was meant to be seen. <br />The Criterion Collection version of \\"Ran\\" is excellent.  It is a beautiful sharp transfer with proper color saturation.  There is a commentary by Stephen Price and a film appreciation by Sidney Lumet.  Disc Two has some great supplements, including a documentary on Kurosawa, another documentary on the makingof \\"Ran,\\" an absolutely ravishing tour through Kurosawa's paintings and sketches for the film (which, by the way, clearly indicate Kurosawa's color preferences!), and an interview with actor Tatsuya Nakadai.  There is also a wonderful 28-page booklet stuffed with interesting reviews and interviews. <br />\\"Ran\\" is one of Kurosawa's greatest films, and perhaps one of the greatest Japanese films ever made.  It is not surprising that Criterion has given this film the stellar treatment.  It is a splendid film and Criterion's version is a splendid addition to your DVD collection.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I am re-reading the book, and I am just thrilled at how the script follows it so well.

6305907145|4.0|This movie adresses the harsh realities of the times, such as marrying for love and ending up in poverty with a houseful of children and bug infested living quarters.  also adresses the horrors of slavery in a subtle way.   <br />love story wise, it's still the jane austin we women like. <br />there's a tad of nudity parents might want to be warned about. <br />this isn't a warm and fuzzy movie, but literature wise i think it can be appreciated.
B0000048CP|5.0|I am 32 old years now, and I remember I hear this album for the first time when I was in high school... I can tell you I have not stopped listening 'til now. This is the best Black Metal Album so far. The atmosphere is unbelievable from the first intro and the classic anthem A FINE DAY TO DIE, then the records takes you to a journey of speed, really fantastic, a lesson on how to play fast and heavy but with endless variants, special mention to GOLDEN WALLS OF HEAVEN amd PACE TIL DEATH that will make you sweat just by listening... and the journey ends with another masterpiece of melancholic roughness with BLOOD FIRE DEATH that ends as the record begins, so by the time it ends, you start feeling addicted to speed and will push play again and again and again. The album is consistent and intense, hard to pick just one song, definitely you have to listen the journey from the beginning to the end every time you play it.
3832790810|5.0|Out of all of the photography books that I have or seen, this one is definitely in my top five favorites. <br /> <br />The layout of the book is very nice. It has a velvety cover under the dust cover and is a very good size for viewing.  <br /> <br />The photography is great. Silvereye wasn't really to my personal preference but Private Rooms is. They are images from shoots throughout the years in one collection taken in different hotel rooms, apartments, etc. The photographer seems to mostly use ambient light - a mix between tungsten and window light. Probably a somehwat high ISO, the images are still very low grain and are very clear with nice colors and tones. Very nice compositians, nice lighting, sexy poses,... all very tasteful. <br /> <br />The models are some of the most beautiful models I've seen in just about any book - there isn't a medeocre looking girl in the whole book - all are just phenomenally gorgeous. Most images are partial nude, some with latex gloves, high heels, elegant jewelry,... a lot of accessories, etc.  <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this one.
0684824906|5.0|Kudos to Doris Kearns Goodwin for doing the impossible: bringing Abraham Lincoln to life so we get to know him as a person. I've read other sources on Lincoln and they failed by large margin. This book allows the reader not only to get a sense for how great a man Lincoln was, but it superbly describes his era and the immense challenges he faced. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone - especially to our current President.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Rod Stewart since Maggie May but for whatever reason (age?) I find listening to this totally different genre incredibly relaxing and enjoyable.
0670034711|5.0|This is a wonderful story of self-discovery. Gilbert gives a frank, humorous and self-deprecating account of her year's travel through Italy, India, and Bali. Its upbeat pace and conversational tone make it a wonderfully absorbing read. Enjoyable for anyone who has questioned where they are in life and whether starting anew ever really works.  <br /> <br />I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN and I can't wait to read her other books. <br />
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi was an excellent read. Yann Martel has the talent to put intersting characters, setting, and plot into one extrodinary story. I definitely recomend this book to any reader ready for an amazing story.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I'm a fan from way back. I've noticed that most reviews compare the cast of this film with this Original London Cast Rercording (the most popular recording of the show). This bothers me for several reasons: I think things should be based on their own merit and comparing this to one recording ignore the hundreds of other performers who have played these roles. It also ignores the fact that film and stage are different mediums for which different things are appropriate.     So what does that mean for this film and this cast? Well I hate to say it but Gerard Butler knocks a star off my rating. He is very probably the worst Phantom I've ever seen/heard. Oh what this film could have been with a different leading man! The story dictates that the Phantom is two things: deformed and a supernaturally brilliant singer. Why the young, good looking yet vocally challenged Butler was cast is beyond me. Andrew Lloyd Webber says in the DVD extras that he liked the \\"rock n' roll\\" edge that Butler's voice had. Well, I say you can find good singers with the same \\"edge\\". Butler not only has a weak voice and poor control of it, he also tries to express emotion by alternating volumes: he yells and whispers to indicate anger and sadness. His notes are  kept as short as possible and when he has to hold one he sounds as if he's on the point of breaking. If he were in an amateur production or singing karaoke I'd say he's alright. Here he falls amazingly short. As a character he is not the darkly romantic figure or the genius tormented by madness: he's a boring guy who lives in a basement and whines when he doesn't get his way. And the Phantom is not meant to be young or physically attractive- he represents a twisted father figure to Christine.  It's more of a challenge for an actor to draw sympathy from an audience based on his voice, his small emotional gestures, and in spite of hideous makeup. Butler's voice isn't enought to draw emotion on it's own. His looks are marred by a sunburn and his age is young enough to make him more of a romantic prospect for Christine in the eyes of the audience. I give Butler credit for making the attempt but his Phantom is the weak point in this production.    People claim that Raoul is a boring character which I understand to a certain extent but he's a necessary one. He loves Christine in a healthy way while the Phantom's love is a dangerous obsession. He's stable where the Phantom isn't. Vocally Patrick Wilson is everything that Gerard Butler is not.  He sings with a strong, polished tenor voice that's well suited to his character: a handsome young nobleman. Physically he is well suited to his role (though I could have lived without the Fabio inspired hairdo).     At 16 Emmy Rossum was a full 10 years younger than most stage Christines when she took on the role. Vocally speaking that's a lot, and she sounds young. Her voice is breathy and with a few more years of training it would have been much stronger on the higher notes. While it might not get by on stage it's just right for film: it has a pure, sweet sound that's suited to the character. Rossum allows it to grow with the film. In her opening sequence \\"Think of Me\\" it's soft but as the character goes though emotional trials her voice gains it's footing and some more strength. It takes on a haunting quality in the mournful ballad \\"Wishing You Where Somehow Here Again\\" and shows some rich darker colors in the title song and the \\"Point of No Return\\". Rossum is also a good actress: she's been criticized for using too few facial expressions but I felt that she conveyed what she had to when she had to (how many facial expressions are meant to be employed when one's character is hypnotized?). Her Christine has an innocent, melancholy allure.    As for the direction  it's alternately wonderful and absurd. I loved Joel Shumaker's visual references to Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, and his reimagining of The Point of No Return which is quite different from the stage version. But he seems too intent on making the film \\"sexy\\" by putting the women in lowcut dresses and casting a sexy but utterly inappropriate Phantom. The story, the music and the lyrics have a dark sensuality but Schumaker underestimates the intelligence of his audience by beating them over the head with it. Also he seems unsure of what to do with his camera during solos. In \\"Think of Me\\" we watch Christine standing still onstage, in \\"Music of the Night\\" we watch the Phantom lead Christine aimlessly around his lair and in \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" we see Christine walk through a cemetary. I can't help but think all 3 could have been more interesting in more able hands.     If I could give this 3 and 1/2 stars I would but as it is I have to subtract one star due to Gerard Butler's performance and another for Schumaker's overbearing direction (though if I could I'd only take way 1/2 a star for that)

B0007KTBIU|4.0|In the special features on the Lion King DVD, they were quasi-lamenting that their film was kind of the B team and that Pocahontas was going to be the next big release like Beauty and the Beast. How odd and by how far the underdog team won. Lion King became to be one of the most successful animated films ever, in theatres and home video. Pocahontas on the other hand didn't get favorable reviews and only a respectable box office return. The film isn't Pinocchio or Bambi status by any means but it's sure better than what they've been doing lately, even if it was 10 years ago. <br /> <br />The story centers around Pocahontas living in her village. All is fine until ships from England appear looking for gold. Each group is curious and cautious about the other until Pocahontas meets John Smith, one of the more well-known settlers. So it's a love story set against the backdrop of natives not wanting their land changed and settlers hunting for gold with Pocahontas and John Smith caught in the middle. <br /> <br />What the film has going for it is a rich color palette, quite simply it looks great. It doesn't have that sharpness or finesse like Lion King but it's certainly a colorful film to look at. The songs aren't quite as exciting. What made previous songs work is that they worked independently of the film as well. Under the Sea or Prince Ali works just as fine without the film in front of you. The 2 big songs from here are Around the River Bend and Colors of the Wind and only the latter is memorable without seeing the movie. <br /> <br />We can look at the historical changes that Disney made(which you can research, tons of sites) and say they were done for storytelling purposes(apparently Pocahontas was much older than 16 for real, would've been creepy on screen, no?), or say it's pure Disney manipulative trife that messes with things to better suit the story on a $ front. To me it doesn't matter as long as the version they're telling isn't blatantly manipulative. The villain doesn't get a big comeuppance on the likes of Ursula or Shan Yu and the film doesn't end with a big smooch like Aladdin or Hercules but at least it ends properly given the changes. <br /> <br />Pocahontas is part of what is most likely going to be a series of what I call \\"Gold Editions\\" even though those kind of exist. The big classics like Lion King, Cinderella and Lady and the Tramp got Platinum while Pocahontas, Tarzan, Mulan and most likely Hercules get just a 2 disc edition. It's still nice to own them and Pocahontas is worthy of being included in the Disney shelf, it just may not be your favorite. <br /> <br />
B00000583F|3.0|\\"Sleep's Holy Mountain\\" sounds like it must be a land of perpetually harshed mellow.  I can only imagine that its occupants must constantly be at odds with themselves as to how they should spend their time away from sobriety.  They could OD on potato chips or Chex mix.  Maybe they could watch some bad TV or check out a magnificent yellow sunset.  Or, they could knock someone out.  Up until this album, I didn't think you could really lace weed with rage. <br /> <br />Sleep manage to construct a somewhat spiritual, yet brutal, hybrid of 70s THC-induced sludge and the more danceable aspects of metalcore.  Loud, slow and highly rhythm driven, \\"Sleep's Holy Mountain\\" rarely jacks up the speed, allowing for the songs to slowly carry you off into some sort of magic mushroom-encumbered Neverland where people can apparently get trapped \\"under leagues of ocean\\".  In the case of \\"Dragonaut\\" and \\"Aquarian\\", the songs are slowed down even more by the second verse like the band are either playing around with the songs' rhythm in a subtle way, or they're just too blazed to know the difference.   <br /> <br />Despite, the heavily applied drug aspects of this record though, you really don't have to be high to appreciate it.  Al Cisneros powers this unit ably, providing a low end that more or less stars as the album's main attraction.  Highly droning guitar at the hands of Matt Pike only enhance the rhythm, while Chris Hakius brings a beating upon his drum kit like he's mad at it.  From start to finish though, the dynamic doesn't really break routine and comes dangerously close to getting old.  Even Cisneros' vocals, which are heavily aided with the help of some cheap ethereal studio effect, grow tired and start interfering with the songs as opposed to giving them meaning and direction.  It isn't until \\"From Beyond\\" that the band fully demonstrates how capable they are of playing with the formula and taking advantage of the infinite possibilities granted them by their many influences. <br /> <br />Overall, Sleep proves to be a powerful trio, taking stoner rock to an interesting place and letting us join the ride.  \\"Sleep's Holy Mountain\\" seems like a great place to visit, but I don't think I'd want to live there.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|If you are a Hitchcock fan, this is the film to see.  I like Carey's films in the late 50s and 60s.  The cast is excellent and Carey is is at his best and my all time favorite film.  If you are looking for a Friday night suspence thriller classic with some popcorn, this is the movie!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have to say that I was very impressed with this mini-series. If you are a fan of period drama you must see this! It has a beautiful storyline and the acting is superb. I have heard other people say that this was better than Pride & Prejudice, I can not honestly agree with that. The overall feel of both stories are so very different that I wouldn't even compare the two. They are each in a class of their own, both wonderful from beginning to end. I would highly recommend either of the two.
B000065BPB|5.0|Incredibly comfortable headphones, even when used for a long period of time. Headphones fit snugly, but comfortably over the ears with soft cushioning ear cups.  Its passive noise cancellation does a great job of filtering out background noise.  I used them on a recent flight and was amazed by the amount of noise cancellation of the plane's engines.  The music reproduction is first-class, with tight bass and clean highs. I highly recommend these headphones.
0763611883|5.0|My daughter absolutely adores Charlie and Lola and this book only lets that love grow. She runs around the house reciting all the vegetables that she won't eat adding a few of her own. Then after she has informed of what she will not eat, she actually wants to try everything on the list. Thanks for opening my daughter's eyes to a new vegetable, tomatoe, which she wouldn't touch before this book.
B00005JJX8|5.0|This film with Carey Grant and Grace Kelly will make you want to travel to the French Rivera.  I was a child when I first saw this film and thought it was awesome and kept my attention.  Hitchcock was at his best and he used the right cast and characters to perfection.  This is a good Saturday night film for a married or a couple getting ready to get married.
0805028846|5.0|This book has beautiful examples and wonderful instructions  It gave me the confidence to copy and create.
0440419514|5.0|If you liked the Narnia Books, but felt they lacked depth, or if you liked the Tolkein Ring Books, but felt lost in the labyrinth of battles and characters, then this trilogy will satisfy! It takes a bit of patience to understand the set-up of the story at first, but once you get it, it's an exciting ride. The characters are magnificent, complicated, heroic. The sub-text is profound and touches many aspects of humanity including greed, loyalty, bravery and the passage from childhood to adulthood.<br /><br />In the first book \\"The Golden Compass\\" we are introduced to Lyra Belacqua, the noble young heroin of all three books, and her shape-shifting daemon/familiar Pan. Longing for adventure, she gets more than she bargains for as she journeys north to face witches, armored polar bears, the deceptions of her own parents and an evil plot to harm children. Her plucky heroism and quick thinking save the day but each of the first two books finishes with the steps into the next story. The three books could have been written as one, and should be read in order.<br /><br />This otherwordly tale will inspire and delight. Parents, read these books aloud with your children. You will all have a great adventure together, and find yourself immersed in a vast world peopled with exciting and fascinating creatures.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|This movie was a horrible remake and an embarassement to the H.G. Wells and the original movie in 1960 starting Rod Taylor.  Guy Pierce is bored with the role and the movie does not resemble the novel at all.  Eveything takes place in America instead of England.  I really thought it was a total joke, boring, and had a horrible ending.  He never goes back to see his friend Filby to tell him good bye.  I thought that Simon Wells was a horrible director and should be ashame of taking such a classic and tearing it to pieces.  Don't even purchase this movie, waist of money and time. Amazon is making me give this move 1 start and it doesn't even deserve that!!!!
020530902X|5.0|This book offers a concise guide to writing that covers the basic things that you wouldn't normally consider while writing a paper.  Though it doesn't deal with citation, it does cover tricky grammar notes and the things people normally mess up in their writing.  It is a great, cheap tool to enhance your writing!
B000059XUO|5.0|the crow is definently a perfect comic book adaptation, it had everything that the comic book had and delivered a great film. i thought the way it was shot was impresive, giving a dark color to it makeing it seem black and white and the lead role of brandon lee, well done. the film is basiclly about a crow that brings back a dead rocker to avenge the people who murdered him and his fiance, the day before there wedding. so, simple story but then you had some action, stand out characters, and capture the essence of urban decay and you've got a winner. i really thought brandon lee could have become big if he hadn't died. so nice flick, i recomend seeing.<br /><br />P.S. don't see the sequels, they suck
B000BEZQ18|4.0|I've found a new product, which here in Italy may be I'll never be able to find, with a good price and easy to buy and pay. I've received the CD fastly, even if anybody say to me that I've to pay another tax (5.50 ) directly to the post.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|With this fantastic album, Madonna has offered confessions that are very ear-pleasing and butt-shaking. Because of her, I have sweated on numerous occasions. Check it out today!
B000001G5A|5.0|I can only review Bohm's interpretation of the requiem in the context of the only other version I have -- the weak Karajan version recorded in 1987.  In contrast to Karajan who rushes through this piece in an unseemly and bizarre manner, Bohm adopts a majestic pace much more suitable, in my view, to this sort of music.  Some think the pace too slow but I find Bohm's reading delicately nuanced yet crisp and quite vigorous when it needs to be.  Bohm's take on the requiem feels flexible, mature, confident, whereas Karajan feels like he is trying much too hard for reasons that are entirely inapparent.  Moreover, the singing on the Bohm recording is much better than that on the Karajan.  The soloists in particular sound far superior and the chorus is wonderful.  Interestingly, both Karajan and Bohm recorded with the Wiener Philharmoniker -- except Bohm clocks in at 64:26 (mins: secs) versus Karajan at 52:10.  Unless you are in a hurry for some strange reason, you should buy this version and smell the flowers, as it were.
B000AYQLX6|4.0|A lovely CD restored to sonic clarity... from John's 'lost weekeend' period.  He's Sooo <br />honest, melodic and inventive.  Lyrically he's emotionally generous (\\"Bless You\\") <br />resigned (\\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out\\"\\") self aware the 'Hatred and jealousy' section of \\"Scared\\") and what was a bit of a dull, murky original mix and pressing is now pristine.  Bless Yoko for her stewardship of his aural catalogue but both of my thumbs down for her repackaging -- losing John's orignal cover of childhood drawings, and the disk graphics are maybe a bit misleading/self serving (John and Yoko's faces morphing, originally from the Sometime In NYC record; but <br />this was the lost weekend, and May Pang was in the picture as well.)
B00005JNBQ|5.0|You'll either love this movie or hate it.  I love it.  Very quirky, extremely enjoyable, often very funny.  The kind of movie where you'll walk away remembering the lines and scenes.  Nevermind all the negative reviews - just see it for yourself!!<br /><br />As far as the DVD extra material goes, it's not too loaded, but does have some good stuff.
0060839872|3.0|Good book but you have to engage your mind to keep up with it.
0307276902|2.0|Kept turning the pages as if I was going to get it!! on the next page.....Can't always believe OPRA, can we??
0440419514|5.0|I read these books a few years ago and they were AWESOME. Everybody that I recommended them to winds up reading them and loving them. I just bought myself a new boxed set and I lent it to my father. He read the Golden Compass and loved it and he is now on the second book in the series. I have told so many people about these books. I read a LOT. I work for a book publisher so I get tons of free books and this series remains one of my all-time favorites. I told my sister-in-law about these books, she read them and now she rants and raves to everyone about them too.<br /><br />What makes them so good? A combination of things: the characters are really strong - you either love them or love to hate them; the story is tight, well-paced and imaginative and it makes you want to keep reading; the setting is a world like ours but different and special - like a dream, but not too weird that you can't picture it. I can't say enough about how great these books are. And although these books can be found in the young readers section of the bookstore, I personally think they are pretty complex and adult in nature. There are some rather mature undertones throughout the series. So don't let the fact that they are placed in various sections in a bookstore throw you off. It's just that they are very enjoyable for a wide range of ages.<br /><br />Buy these books!! You will love them!!
B00003CX6P|5.0|There are some homosexual themes.  However, this is an unequivocal five star movie.<br /><br />Outstanding in every respect.
B0006L0LOS|4.0|This is probably one of the classiest pulp films of recent.  I think it got a bad rap from the film industry for ignoring the Batman tie-in.  It's an extremely enjoyable movie ride.  It has all the elements of revenge, love, regret, etc. (and for love movies I like \\"la 'Alante\\", so I am no rube).  Go for it & you will enjoy it, as we do occasionally.  It's a shame that the \\"critic industry\\" would deprive anyone of the enjoyment this film has to offer.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This movie will enhance your understanding of the Vietnam conflict and the office of the Secretary of Defense.
B00015YVD6|3.0|It is funny indeed, but, John Candy is a lot funnier than the key characters.  He deserved Hank's role.
B000001EXR|4.0|Its really too bad that Paul Stanley/Gene Simmons had to be so money hungry and kick Bruce Kulick/Eric Singer out so they could make even more millions off a reunion tour.To top it off they released Psycho Circus which was no better than anything they released with Kulick except maybe Crazy Nights.Some reviewers say how Carnival of Souls isnt Kiss,but that to me is what makes this album so great is that is doesnt sound like the same old Kiss.Kiss have always been a realtively perverted band and that is almost completely absent on this album,which provides for a more mature sound and a very plesant listen.How many times can you really say youll screw anything that walks before it wears thin?I feel Kiss had beaten that horse senseless and it was time for a change,but it didnt have to be bringing back flakes Frehley/Criss.Hopefully Simmons/Stanley will get a hair up their butt to maybe try a Kulick/Singer reunion.I really am tired of the touring this group is doing without new music.Anyways step outside the box for one album Kiss fans and enjoy something Different,but actually GOOD unlike previous attempts at different.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I recieved the \\"BAD\\" cassette tape when I was in the 10th grade!  Burned it out!!  I used to \\"fast-forward\\" over the songs that weren't on the radio.  I don't \\"FF\\" anymore!  I love all the songs and fell in love with the additional ones.  It was interesting to hear Quincy Jones talk about the making of this album.  I must admit, the Spanish version of \\"I just can't stop loving you\\" threw me for a loop.  Once I caught on to what was going on, I had to laugh!...I never knew Michael sang in Spanish.  My new favorites are \\"Streetwalker\\" and \\"Fly Away\\"!  True entertainment, true talent, and true dedication to his art.
B000E1155E|1.0|If this is what passes now for purportedly inventive and original rock music, then Lester Bangs was right and rock is and remains dead.  <br /> <br />However, the U.K. and U.S. music industry marketing and media machine remains very alive, finely tuned and oiled, and is doing better than ever to separate the less-than-selective masses from their pounds and sense. If mediocrity is what we reward, then that's what we'll get.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I have been having this album on VHS for a long time and I am really happy that it is now available on DVD format as well.This is really good and you can get this with the pulse dvd from the same band as well.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|I finally saw this movie that was much raved about by friends.<br /><br />Now I understand the stupid and inane \\"Lucky\\" and \\"Yessss\\" that they have been spouting randomly during normal conversations.<br /><br />I must say I approached this film with an open mind. I wanted to see just what was so special about this movie. Best I can say after watching the whole thing is....Huh? This movie seems to be one of those \\"If you don't like it, you are just too un-cool\\". Hence, all the kids at school are jumping on the bandwagon since they want to be cool for seeing ND. I wish all of the praisers of this film would quit making it out to be something it isn't. There is NO deeper meaning or abstract message to be gleaned from it.<br /><br />This has to be probably THE stupidest movie I have ever seen!  It is completely void of ANY redeeming qualities. Brainless dialog, disgusting food and bizarre situations abound. I kept waiting for the \\"funny part\\". It never came.  Unless you're on serious drugs or your brain is comatose or extremely unexercised, I recommend you NOT waste your time or money on this MTV hyped film.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 is one of the finest groups and their latest album is almost as good as JOSHUA TREE.highly recommended.I was happy that they got 5 grammys.
078322737X|2.0|American Graffiti is really the sort of film that can be regarded as a classic, without its actually being particularly great. It's entertaining, and it makes you laugh, but it's very corny at times, none of the elements are particularly well done, in fact the only reason it's so famous is that it's a clear sign of the times both in which it was made and in which it is set.<br /><br />The various stories it tells about four friends at life's crossroads in the sixties, and the events that befall them on one particular night, are all really quite good.<br /><br />So overall, despite occasional hammy acting or corny line, American Graffiti is definitely worth a look. A sign of the times though it is, it still gives you a good time and a good feeling all these years later
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scaface is a great flick very similar to movies like the sicilian and godfather.This movie has some great performances from AL PACINO.WORTH A WATCH.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00003CWPL|5.0|First off, Eraserhead it is not a movie. It is not a film. It is a piece of art.  Having said that, this movie will not be enjoyed by those who enjoy movies that are mainstream and only made for those not used to watching movies with an open mind.  The movie you are watching here is like 'a piece of art that has to be viewed to be understood'.  This movie is like taking drugs, without taking drugs.  It's a drug in itself.  In fact, I can't even imagine taking drugs with this movie (your head or eraserhead might explode).  This is a movie like no other (written in 1977), but looks like a movie from 2005.  I would compare this movie to Brazil, Naked Lunch or even The Order (Cremaster Series) in the fact that it forces you to watch this movie in almost a stand still (it's like your stunned and not sure what or why your watching this movie).  At the end of the movie, you turn to yourself and say \\"Wow, what did I just watch?\\" <br /> <br />Eraserhead is the other film that excels in sound. A frankly disturbing concoction of industrial score and white noise with undercurrents of musical hall and sonorous church organ, it is almost an extra character in the film, and easily it's most prominent factor.  <br /> <br />Yet Eraserhead is to be recommended for more than its incidentals. An impenetrable and gloomy work, what is it actually about? Who is the credited `man in the planet' who pulls levers that control giant spermatozoa? Many questions like this permeate a film which perhaps has to be seen several times to get over the initial shock of it's avant gardism. Lynch extracts the everyday and supplants it with the exceptionally bizarre. The experience of meeting a girlfriend's parents for the first time is never worse than here, where the parents in question gyrate spasmodically to the animated legs of a blood-spitting chicken. It's these scenes - along with the deformed mutant baby - that could lend the film the air of an abortion debate. Birth and repressed sexuality thrive throughout the film, from suckling puppies to the seductive appeal of the `beautiful girl across the hall' and a mother-in-law that gets too close for comfort. I guess the entire film could be a man's mental breakdown when faced with the premature responsibilities of marriage and fatherhood. Though to be honest I couldn't even begin to imagine what it's really all about. <br /> <br />Encroaching blackness fills every scene, where lights are intermittent at best, and at worse fail completely. Often sets - particularly the bedroom when `Mary X' is feeding the child - are like prison cells. Two of the most eerie segments involve a title-explaining dream (?) where Henry's (Nance's) head is carved into pencil rubbers and an unsettling musical number from the `lady in the radiator'. This is the same lady with two candyfloss-like lumps on her cheeks that alternates her stage appearances between stamping on giant sperm to singing with religious convictions. <br /> <br />Direction and cinematography are brilliant throughout, though the climax is the ultimate extension of a film that borders on darker, extremely unpleasant aspects of reality. Folks, if you want to impress your friends that think they have seen it all (and haven't seen Eraserhead, then my friends, this film is a film for anyone who enjoys to go to the 3rd world for a dreamlike, drug indused moment).  I'm still in augh over this film and I've seen it at least 5 times. Must buy for all movie collector's of the abnormal (yet mindblowing movies).  I'm shocked this is Lynch's first movie (he did many shorts prior to this, but for a first movie 'KUDOS' Lynch).  You must see his other great films also... The Shorts Of David Lynch, Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, Hotel Room, Wild At Heart, Lumiere And Company, The Elephant Man, Dune and of course Twin Peaks (The Series) and Twin Peaks - Fire Walk With Me (2 of my favorites).  I'm still patiently waiting for Twin Peaks the 2nd Series and Lost Highway, to come out on DVD (my VHS copies are getting worn out). <br /> <br />People if you are still reading this review, stop and click on the 'Purchase ASAP' button.  I own 'Eraserhead 2000', it has been cleaned and remastered and has an extra long interview with Lynch himself (talking about filming Eraserhead). <br /> <br />\\"In Heaven Everything Is Fine\\" - Quoted from the movie.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|This CD should come with a WARNING: <br />This is prescription strength Chicago Blues and is not for use by those on medication for high blood pressure, heart disease, or if you've recently been shot by the vice-president of the United States.   <br /> <br />Transparent platform pumps and stripper pole sold separately.  (But recommended) <br /> <br />With a vocal range that would make Al Green turn green, guitar licks that inspired Jimi Hendrix, Clapton, and Page -- this CD is the Chicago legend's crown jewel.  He doesn't make any attempt to recap his career here -- he just cranks out funky mo-town rockin blues like he has for 50 years in a 'grab-your baby and hold on tight' groove that doesn't let up from beginning to end.   <br /> <br />Turn on the disco ball, break out the leather, the lingerie, the blindfolds and scarves -- and baby take off your clothes but put on this CD first and you will instantly be 20 years younger and 20 pounds lighter and you will blow your man's mind. <br /> <br />Buddy even out-funks himself with 'What Kind of Woman is This' and puts a whole new hue to blue on 'Somebody's Been Sleeping in My Bed'. <br /> <br />I've been playing for 20+ years and when I hear guys like Buddy play I want to play until I die and hope that day never comes.  Pay no attention to the nay-sayers and haters... this CD rocks, grooves, swings, sings, and bleeds blue. <br /> <br />Life is good. <br />
0385510454|5.0|I could not put this Book down it is a very compelling spy thriller
B00006YXOX|5.0|Like the previous reviewer, Mr. Modee, I regard this DG set as the \\"classic\\" statement of Bruckner on disc and prefer it to Jochum's later EMI set for its \\"purer\\" style, finer orchestral execution, and leaner sound.  What makes Jochum's Bruckner \\"classic\\" is its inspirational, personal, and spontaneous quality.  It always sounds right.  Jochum is not afraid to vary tempos and emphasize attacks to suit the mood of the moment while preserving forward motion and structural cohesion.  His Bruckner is the antithesis of the single-tempo, ultra-slow, monumental Bruckner represented, for example, by the absurdly over-rated George Tintner on Naxos.  With Tintner, a Bruckner symphony sounds as if it will never end; with Jochum you don't want it to.
0894803123|5.0|I purchased this book for the recipes.  Not only does it have delicious recipes for ice cream; this book explains the science behind making ice cream and the interesting history of Ben and Jerry's.
B000001F9E|5.0|So well produced and engineered that it still sounds good on today's stereo gear.  Early and influential \\"two guitars in unison\\" playing, much like Lynyrd Skynyrd, but no doubt this is rock, not country rock.

B000BJS4TO|4.0|An incredibly beautiful piece of work.  One of those rare soundtracks that actually surpasses the movie it's from and easily one of John Williams' best non-Star Wars works ever.  Sayouri's Theme is worth the price of the CD alone.
B000CSUYFQ|1.0|Pitchfork gave it a 9.  I give it a 2.  It's like a jam-band version of chopsticks fighting with a washing machine inside an empty oil drum.   <br /> <br />That being said, I LOVED their earlier stuff so I might just be bitter.  Maybe it'll grow on me.
0307276902|4.0|It was a very good story.  You have to go into it with the understanding that it is not a true story.  I believe that the things that he details in his book could be a compleation of many different peoples experiences.  Well worth the read.
0792163710|1.0|Anyone who knows the American West, as I do, knows full well that Ranching made these lands, not farmable except for a truck farm here and there, what they are today. The people behind this movie, and for ought I know the book which I have not read, have made a direct attack on ranchers, who have historically been manly and forceful men, but not immoral or lawless, as this movie Shane would have you believe. Why they choose to portray us this way, I do not know, but I do know that Hollywood was always full of Communists and I think it is possible that this circumstance has something to do with the false picture of a way of life that nobody needs to be ashamed of.
0553456350|5.0|This novel offers you travel-adventure and court-room drama. It explores addiction, greed and spirituality in a materialistic world. And all this is delivered to you in the form of a wholesome story (in the end at least) that carries you along at just the right pace (it slowes down here and there but never really gets bogged down).
B000E97Y6K|1.0|This movie is absolute garbage. I know coming of LOTR, the next film was going to be an up hill battle for Jackson, but I had some faith. When I heard he was going to Kong, I thought why waste your time, Kong is a classic case closed. This film confirms that. There is nothing, NOTHING good about it. The acting is bad, the screenplay was horrible, the FX shots were lame, the directing was too frantic at times , and the action was overbearing and LONG at times. Don't get me wrong, the first half with the characters' background being established is good, the big inside joke/reference of the first film's director (whose name escapes me) and Fay Wray, it gave me hope that from what I saw in the previews that the movie wasn't going to be that bad. I was wrong, once they get to Skull Island, meet Kong, and get back to NY... from that on out TRASH! <br />If anything could have saved this, it would have been the prospect of the film being turned into a 2 or 3 part movie. The first could have been how the map gets into Jack Black's chubby fingers (which Black is still a HORRIBLE ACTOR), the second could have been about Kong and the other dealings of Skull Island, and if they were to have done a 3 parter, the last could have been about Kong in NY,  <br />The absolute worst thing is the FX! Just trash. The effect shot with Brody and Black between the running dinosuars' legs is so bad, but not as bad as Kong himself.  <br />Kong looked as fake in the previews as he did in the final film. <br />And the prize for worst FX shot in this trash goes to when Kong falls and hits the ground, there is NO IMAPCT SITE! NO CARS OVER TURNED, NO DUST IN THE AIR OR ON PEOPLE, THE CITY STREET IS NOT BROKEN UP AT ALL, NO WINDOWS IN STORE FRONTS OR CARS BUSTED OUT FROM THE IMPACT OF A WHAT 30 FOOT TALL APE WEIGHING WHAT 2 MAYBE 3 TONS! <br />All in all this was one of the worst times at the movies I have had in a long time. The best part was the previews for Miami Vice, and The Inside Man. <br />And I know some people might say: \\"Why did I go then?\\" I just didn't feel like sitting through Harry Potter again with my mom and sister.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|Masterful Direction, Masterful Performances, Masterful Photography, Masterful Use of Music. One word to describe this film? BEAUTIFUL.

B00005KB9T|5.0|Get this cd if -: <br />a) you appreciate Bob <br />b) you appreciate raw guitar sound <br />c) you know where the volume button is <br />d) all the above applies  <br /> <br />I run into this cd as a fluke. I was browsing thru guitar music, and this cd talked about the early Bob Marley music and the extended version of Stir it up, Concrete Jungle guitar section. Given that I have 10 cd's of Bob, I decided to give this one a go, since I can never seem to have enough of Bob. I am not a rasta, or a ganja smoker...I just happen to have grown up around uncles who listened to Bob, and as it came to be, I appreciate his works. <br /> <br />Long story short, I put this cd in my car stereo, and boy does it stir some raw emotions. The kicker was I took my wife on a date and just when she got into the car, I tuned the cd to \\"Baby we've got a date\\", and she was hooked!! I also use this cd to make her feel good with my attempt to sing along the \\"High Tide or Low Tide\\" song. <br /> <br />In summary, this is the best $16 I have spent on a cd in a long, long, loooooonnnnnnnggggg! time.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|<br /> With all of the albums that Neil Young has turned out over the years, this may be his best.From the soulful tunes that we have come to expect from him to his use of words which is unexcelled, I found this to be a totally satisfying experience. Very reminiscent of \\"Harvest Moon\\"
B000E1YVZU|4.0|Set on some of New York's meanest streets and very loosely based on Puccini's LA BOHEME with the AIDS epidemic substituted for tuberculosis, Jonathan Larson's RENT is an unexpected collage of stark visuals, memorable music and lyrics, and on-the-edge characters--and it was more than enough for the play to win a host of critical accolades, including the 1996 Pulitzer Price for Dramatic literature, an honor only rarely awarded to musical fare.  But stage excitement seldom translates undiluted to the screen, and in this RENT is no exception.<br /><br />The basic story remains the same, and in general concerns the various artistic ambitions and romantic complications of several men and women whose savage rebellion against the status quo has led them to hand-to-mouth lives in New York.  But even as they come together to protest the impending commercialization of the dilapidated district they call home, their relationships with each other begin to spiral out of control--and the lifestyle of casual sex and drug abuse begins to take a serious toll, with several HIV-positive characters forced to face mortality in increasingly direct ways.<br /><br />With two exceptions, the cast consists of those who originated the roles in the 1996 Broadway show.  To my mind, the big noise here is Wilson Jermaine Heredia, who repeats his Tony award-winning performance as Angel, a street musician and drag queen who acts as the emotional center of the group; that said, however, the overall cast is quite fine and plays at full throttle, even if Anthony Rapp and Idina Menzel do seem a bit too old for this story of youthful angst some ten years after they originated their roles on the New York stage.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film stumbles in a visual sense.  Certainly there is considerable urban decay on the screen, but it is also very much a Hollywood-ized concept of it; instead of going with a rawly gritty quality, which would have benefited the material, the designers have elected to sweeten everything where possible, and the end result has a slightly \\"sanitized for your protection\\" quality.

B00005RHGK|1.0|This is just an awful movie. The only sequence that \\"scares\\" is at the police station. Don't waste your time and money watching this C-R-A-P with terrible actors!!!
B000002LOE|5.0|This is R.E.M.'s most blatantly commercial work but that doesn't make this a bad album.  In fact, some of my favourite tracks are on this disc and \\"Losing My Religion\\" will always be remembered as one of their best ever tracks.  What people seem to overlook though is the importance of Peter Buck to the band.<br /><br />The guitarist comes up with the most brilliant string arrangements on all their albums and especially so on the brilliant next album \\"Automatic for the People.\\"  Buck not only plays great appeggios on my favourite track from this album, (composed and sung by the bass player!) \\"Near Wild Heaven\\", great riffs on my next favourite, \\"Shiny Happy People\\" but also excellent mandolin arrangements on \\"Losing My Religion.\\"<br /><br />This is clearly not their best album as that honour belongs to the album released just after this one and does have a few filler tracks but this is still very enjoyable to listen to and is probably the happiest R.E.M. album, that is, as happy as R.E.M. albums can ever get.  This album has also been very well produced and mastered and so the sound quality is very good.<br /><br />Recommended.

0140187863|4.0|I was first introduced to D.H. Lawrence in a Brit Lit class when I was in college.  We read SONS AND LOVERS, and I was totally blown away by Lawrence's verdant prose and by the novel's brutal, uncomfortable beauty.  My professor mentioned LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER frequently while we were studying Lawrence, and since then I've wanted to read this later, more well-known, more controversial work.  Finally, two years after that class, I got around to it. <br /> <br />LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER tells the story of a young woman named Constance Reid, who marries Sir Clifford Chatterley when he's home on leave for a month from the battlefields of World War I.  After a month of honeymooning, Clifford must return to the war; and sadly, when he returns six months later, he comes home \\"more or less in bits,\\" paralyzed from the waist down. The newlyweds settle at Clifford's family home, Wragby, near the industrialized town of Tevershall. <br /> <br />Although Clifford cannot please Constance sexually, he and his wife are intellectually connected; they make love with words, and at first this is enough for Constance.  However, a brief affair with one of Clifford's colleagues makes Connie aware of her more carnal needs, of her desire for physical pleasure. <br /> <br />Enter Oliver Mellors, the Chatterleys' groundskeeper who lives a life of solitude in a secluded wooded cabin.  In Mellors, Connie is awakened to a higher consciousness, to the power of sexual pleasure and mutual satisfaction.  Her relationship with Mellors helps her emerge from her cocoon of prudishness to become a highly sexualized being.  The affair continues under Clifford's nose, and he is either too inattentive to notice or just pretends not to. <br /> <br />As a baronet, Clifford is in a position of power, but he finds himself completely powerless.  The mines of Tevershall, which he controls, are dying; and not only is his industry dead, so is his sexuality.  He, and his business, are impotent.  What makes him so interesting is the almost tender way in which Lawrence portrays him.  The scene in which he tries desperately to force his wheelchair's dying motor to roll uphill while Connie and Mellors look on is particularly heartbreaking.  Clifford is vain, and he has no use for sex or other things of a physical nature, but he also knows that the only way he can produce an heir is if Connie has sex with another man and allows Clifford to claim the child as his own.  His lack of power, and his reaction to the knowledge of it, make him compelling. <br /> <br />Unlike Clifford, Connie's other love interest, Oliver Mellors, is confident and unashamed and almost pagan in his celebration of physicality. He's a surprisingly endearing character, a common man with some very intelligent things to say, who isn't intimidated by class boundaries, who doesn't chastise himself for ravishing a married woman. <br /> <br />Constance Chatterley is a woman awakening to her sexual self, and Lawrence chronicles her metamorphosis in explicit, sensitive detail.  It's suprising how well Lawrence was able to write from a woman's perspective.  However, Connie's perception of her ideal relationship near the end of the novel probably didn't quite ring true for many female readers of the time (at least, not that they would admit):  \\"Complete intimacy!  She supposed that meant revealing everything concerning yourself to the other person, and his revealing everything concerning himself.  But that was a bore.  All that weary self-consciousness between a man and a woman!  a disease!\\"  It's observations like this that made LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER so controversial. <br /> <br />LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER has probably remained so popular for 80 years because of its sexual content, which was undoubtedly completely immoral for the time period in which is was written.  But of course the content is not anything too shocking in today's world of pay-per-view pornography and busty women on the covers of erotic fiction sold in supermarkets everywhere.  However, this book shouldn't be bunched into that category, by today's standards or any other age's; I would like to think LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER is still popular today because of Lawrence's incredibly brave writing. <br /> <br />Lawrence expounds on many controversial ideas in this, his last major novel before his death in 1930.  The novel is rife with criticism of post-WWI England and the failures of industrialization to support a growing economy.  Lawrence believes sensuality should be the means of connecting with environment, not through the workings of iron and gritty coal.  In LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER, industry is impotent; but men and women are sexually alive. <br /> <br />My only issue with the novel is that some of the sex scenes are absolutely ridiculous, and read like Lawrence was writing them merely for the shock factor.  His language is often unnecessarily crude, and the whole \\"John Thomas\\" and \\"Lady Jane\\" thing is just silly.  However, this ridiculousness is balanced nicely with some beautiful, sensual descriptions:  Connie's first orgasm, the use of twined flowers to symbolize purity in love, the beautiful language Mellors uses in his letter to Connie at the end of the novel:  \\"I love the chastity now that it flows between us.  It is like fresh water and rain...like a river of cool water in my soul.\\"   <br /> <br />It's undeniable that Lawrence's prose is absolutely intoxicating and exciting, and he proves it again and again in the pages of this novel, written even as his life was ending.  And that's what makes LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER memorable: not the sex, but the words used to describe the sex.  LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER is an intimate look at love and sex, a novel whose popularity has remained for 80 years--and probably will remain far into the future, and rightfully so.
0440238609|5.0|His Dark Materials are a well thought out trilogy which can be enjoyed by adults and adolescents. The parallels to organized religion and Paradise Lost woven together with the elegant journey of children through adolescence and self awareness is unmatched. A must read.
0140135154|3.0|I read this book in college and enjoyed it very much . I returned to it recently and found it to be interesting, but a bit sophmoric. I realize that it's meant for a general audeince, but it still felt that I was being talked down to. With that being said, it still has some value for those needing an introduction to general theories of how we read art.

1400049628|5.0|Everything you ever needed to know about zombies is covered here. I am a self proclaimed lover of zombie lore, but this book answers all of my questions; even the ones I didn't know I wanted to ask. What makes zombies? Why do they \\"live\\" for so long when they are technically decomposing? How long have they been a threat? What is the best way to kill zombies when they are at the bottom of a lake or pond? <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this book enough. To zombie lovers and to the casual reader, there is enough intriguing information in here to keep you entertained AND prepared for the coming zoombie apocalyse (were it to happen).
B00013RC8O|2.0|Unless you are of the select few who experienced the late 60's drug revolution, you may not enjoy this flick.  I bought it just for the car and the chase scenes, which is the only thing that gave it the 2-star rating.  I almost didn't finish watching it.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|Well i just finished the book Christine last week.  I was determined to find the movie.  After searching for the last week, i finally bout it.  I had seen it a few years ago when i was 10 or 11.  Somehow i remember it being much better.  But nonetheless, it was great.  I do have a few problems though. Generally i dont mind things being rearranged or changed, but they cut out wayyy too much, and completly changed the ending.  They practically swtiched Roland LeBays role and George Lebays role, but only partically, i was quite confused when i got to that scene.  They also completely cut out the Lebay possession sub-plot, thus changing Arnies character.  I was dissapointed in Micheal cunninghams role in this movie, first off, he didnt look like a thing like i pictured him, and his whole sub-plot with Arnie and Dennis was completely cut, and he only have about 10 lines in the entire movie. The biggest dissapointment for me had to be the cutting of the Dennis/Leigh subplot.  THe ending was changed totally, also a disappointment. <br /> <br />However, i do like the rearranging of certain things, it helps the flow of the movie much better, the actors for Arnie and Dennis were perfect, too bad Dennis role was minimized as much as it was.  The effects are AMAZING! even now, i cant imagine them being any better, and this if from way back in 83.  The music is wonderful and perfectly fitting, Regina cunningham is just as i imagined her, her role isnt cut down too much though.  Overall, i stil recommened the movie, one of the better movies based on a stephen king novel, i only say read the novel first. <br /> <br />BTW, their are 20 deleted scenes that i am about to go check out right now, therefore, their should be a good chunck of missing footage in it.
B00006NSGX|5.0|This album is between the  \\"very best\\" of Clapton!There are just 2songs \\"weaks\\", Tears in Heaven and change the world, but all the other 18 songs......are powerful and superb!One more car, one more rider....is a must for a eric Clapton fan!
B000AYEI5Y|4.0|I feel a little shortchanged at only ten tracks.  I liked the first two tracks very much (Beautiful Dawn and You're Beautiful), but the rest of the album not so much.
B0001I561E|5.0|I think that this movie can teach us how to live our lives without fear of a little excitement. It also shows us that it doesent mater if your rich or powerful or what race are you or what religion are you, the only thing that maters are your actions that you do to make the world a better place to live and the all time chliche \\"you are not measured by the size of your wallet but by the size of your heart.\\" God how I like to hear that frase. The songs are entertaining and easy to listen. The song i would like to separate from the reast is the song when Aladin becames a princ. I dont know the name of the song but i cant get the melodies of my mind. It is so easy to remember. The graphic deatails and animation is  very good, just like a cartoon should look like. all in all, two thumbs up for this timless animated movie cartoon, witch will entertain our children and adults for many years to come.
B0000256KE|5.0|When I was 26 in 1986 I bought this, my first Roxy Music album after hearing alot about them.  I swallowed 2 hits of window pane and listened to it and it absolutely blew my mind.  The strange swirling overdubbed vocals of In Every Dream Home, the dramatic arrangements, the pure emotion, the rhythm and instrumentation of Bogus Man, the strange oboe, the guitar... I had never heard anything like it.  I was hooked.  Alas, there were no other Roxy albums that captured the spirit of this one.  The first and third ones came close and I recommend those too, but For Your Pleasure... man.  My interest has recently been renewed by dubbing my old albums onto cd, and finding Reflection, a live recording with a cd rom of some early live performances.  To actually see them on stage at that time was truly a great treat.  Get that too.  I don't know what generation your from, but this is definitely worth checking out.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|\\"Wow.\\"  Those were my exact words as the tears poured out of my eyes at the end of this movie.  My parents had had to basically drag me into the movie theater to see this.  I had kept saying it was stupid and I didn't want to see a movie with a giant monkey running around.  I entered the theater pretty much pissed that I wasn't going to be able to go see Rent a second time.  I left it feeling totally different.  That movie changed me in so many ways.  I felt compassion for a CGI monkey.  Kong became almost like your best friend and you wanted to fight for him.  The acting performances given by Naomi Watts, Adrien Brody, and Jack Black were amazing.  I have so much respect for Naomi Watts.  It was truly an AMAZING acting job.  For most of the film she is acting with a green screen and men in costumes poking her with giant sticks, yet she doesn't let that stop her from giving a great, tear-drawing performance.  Even actors in some of the smaller parts such as Preston (Colin Hanks) and Jimmy (Jamie Bell) give an awesome performance.<br /><br />Peter Jackson is a genius!  This movie has definately set the standard for many motion pictures to come!  Don't miss out on one of the greatest films of the 21st century!!
B0000C8AVM|5.0|Bob Dylan goes back to an earlier acoustic style on this 1974 release and it works like a charm. Every song is excellent with standouts such as \\"Tangled up in Blue\\", \\"Lily Rosemary\\" \\"Shelter from the Storm\\". He has  made many great records prior to this but none this direct or emotionally powerful. To be the best Dylan record, it goes without saying that this is one of rock's greatest acheivements. His next record \\"Desire\\" was much in this style but the songs on \\"Desire\\" are not the equal of this bunch.
B00006J9OT|4.0|I absolutely love this CD and I am so glad I bought it. I first heard this CD when dogsitting for a family I know socially. The father of the family was really into Jazz and \\"Live in Paris\\" was my first attempt at listening to his collection. I was instantly impressed with the songs on this CD and found myself addicted to Diana Krall's rendition of \\"Let's fall in love.\\" In fact, I would like to say I bought the CD for this song alone but there are other musical treasures within this CD.  <br />I don't believe I will see her play anytime soon but it's nice to know that I can hear her play Live in my living room anytime.
B000002J23|4.0|The most overlooked piece in the Yes catalogue.  For many fans, the absence of both Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman make this unworthy of the Yes moniker, but the Buggles (Trevor Horn and Geoff Downs) do a great job of filling in.  This CD showcases a harder edged Yes.  Steve Howe goes for an almost heavy metal feel in his playing on this album.  The opeing bars of Machine Messiah set the tone.  It is funny, but in some ways this CD sets the tone for the next evolution of Yes wherin Jon Anderson returned and Trevor Rabin took over the guitar duties.  Rabin's harder edged guitar playing is more like Howe on this album than any other YES CD.  One minus on this is that the CD clocks in at under 40 minutes. The amount of music you get, but the quality is excellent.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I have no problem with the presence of 'The Director's Cut' on this DVD, as many previous reviewers do.  The one hour original film is included also, so \\"the more the merrier\\" I say.  Looks to me like the producer had his hands on some studio snippits and interviews from the 'Dark Side of the Moon' sessions that he didn't know what to do with, so he spliced them into the only film catalog of Pink Floyd from the same era.  Aside from the similiarity of 'Echoes' with the texture of 'Dark Side of the Moon' there is a disconnect between the two source materials, yet I found the DSOTM material entertaining and enlightening in its own right. <br /> <br />The original concert film is the prime draw, however, and there are very few like it from circa-1970.  While Monterey Pop, Woodstock, and the Isle of Wight festivals were filmed for posterity, very few bands engaged in productions such as we have here from the Floyd.  Fortunately, from my personal perspective, Pink Floyd is being captured at the absolute zenith of their appeal, having just released their masterpiece, 'Meddle'.  Four tracks are drawn from that disc (the 20+ minutes of 'Echoes' being split to form the opening and closing tracks, 'One of These Days' and 'Seamus', here titled 'Mademoiselle Nob').  Two tracks are drawn from 1968's 'A Saucerful of Secrets' (the title track and 'Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun'), and 'Careful With That Axe Eugene' from 1968's 'Ummagumma'.   <br /> <br />The concert is, of course, filmed in an ancient open-air arena in Pompeii, with only the film and sound crew and whatever undeparted spirits remaining as witnesses.  The surreal setting is a stark contrast to the futuristic sounds produced by Pink Floyd.  'The Director's Cut' supplants some of the images of the band with outer space imagery that, in itself, is in sharp contrast to the images of molten lava and steam seething from the ground that graced the original film.  These images also reinforce the '2001: A Space Odessey' connection played upon in Pink Floyd's compositions, vividly portrayed visually in the barren landscapes and the use of speaker towers as symbolic monoliths.  The filming alternates between day and night for the first three tracks, then settles in darkness for the remainder  of the film until 'Echoes Pt. 2' closes the set in sunlight.  The cinematography is comparable to other period pieces, such as Traffic's 1972 epic, 'Live In Santa Monica', with lengthy views of guitar fretwork from Gilmour and Waters, Nick Mason drumming, and Richard Wright keyboarding.  At times the approach is too one-dimensional, such as on 'One Of These Days' where Mason is the singular focus of the camera.  Teeming images of ancient Pompeii at times serve as the backdrop. <br /> <br />The music is the central focus, though at times the visual record demands attention.  Such is the case with Water's whispering screams on 'Careful With That Axe Eugene', and his assault on the cymbals and gong on 'Saucerful of Secrets'.  'Set the Controls...' augments its ancient Egyptian sounds some intriguing views of Richard Wright creating surreal sound effects from his keyboard, and the visual of the howling dog makes the unbearable CD version of 'Seamus' thoroughly enjoyable. <br /> <br />The best track on the disc is the unforgettable 'Echoes Pt. 1', with David Gilmour offering up scintillating lead guitar excursions over pulsing, rhythmic backing hooks.  'Careful With That Axe Eugene' and 'Saucerful..' extend the psychedelic, spacy, experimental feel, while 'One of These Days' returns one more time to the hard rock mantra introduced by 'Echoes'.  All in all, the song selection is about as diverse as the band's collected works at the time could produce.  'Fearless' may have worked well in this setting, and 'Saint Tropez' could have provided even deeper contrasts to Pompeii, though both possess Mediterranean allusions. <br /> <br />'Pink Floyd ' Live at Pompeii', with its rich mix of source materials and generous add-ons, such as printed lyrics, maps of Pompeii, and images of albums related to the tracks performed (even bootleg editions), is a true time capsule for adventurers into the psychedelic era of rock music.  Beyond entertainment, 'Live at Pompeii' is a serious work of art, and an expose on the mindset that fueled production of some of the most progressive music of the modern age.  Like '2001: A Space Odessey', this disc is worthy of shelf space and an occasional revisit into the DVD tray.  A must-see, if not a must-own.
B0000524CY|5.0|Im 14 years old and i watched this about 6 months ago with a couple of friends and my girlfriend and if they wouldnt have been there i would have been so scared its not human.the only reason im writing this is because i decided to search the web for the exorcist and found some disturbing pictures which refreshed my fear.There are 3 main reasons why this film is the scariest of all time:- <br />1.Possession to many people is not impossible and this film outlines how possible it could be which send chills up your spine. <br />2.The makeup and overall goreyness of regan's face scares you and she provides constant shocks <br />3.The crab/Spider walk the single most frightening thing in a horror movie in the world.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|It was such a tragedy when the plug got pulled on the Firefly series, but this film fills the void that the premature halt of the series caused.

0805079076|4.0|\\"Unfolding of Language\\" is excellent in part.  The author's description of \\"lazy\\" language speakers who tend to shorten and simplify words was excellent.  Thus, languages like French and Chinese have evolved toward the monosyllabic over time. The section on the \\"p\\" to \\"f\\" shift in many languages was also illuminating and seemed based on the same tendency toward laziness of speakers.   <br /> <br />These outstanding discussions were balanced by others which became a bit tedious -- and not enhanced by the author's sense of humor and fun.  He spends a lot of time analyzing how sentences are put together in many different languages.  That's interesting if not carried too far.  Similarly, the examination of the parts of speech were carried on at a length that exceeded my attention span. The \\"evolutionary tour\\" the author proposes means to me more or a world, macro outlook on the development of languages rather than the micro approach the author often uses. I thought his chapter on \\"me Tarzan, you Jane\\" development of languages by primitive peoples to be on the impoverished side of good.    <br /> <br />Still, everybody will find many parts of this well-informed analysis interesting.  Those interested in Semitic languages, for example, will find detailed discussions of the evolution of the Semitic verbs. There's also a lot of material here about Turkish.  For the general reader and speaker of English, however, this book doesn't measure up to \\"Empires of the Word : A Language History of the World\\" by Nicholas Ostler.   <br /> <br />Smallchief
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw the movie, Serenity, and loved the story and the cast of characters.     I didn't know the movie was a continuation of a T.V. series and decided to check out Firefly.   I was absolutely blown away with all of the episodes.   I loved the all the actors, the stories, the writing, and twists and turns that only Joss Whedon can provide.  The cast worked so well together and became their characters so seamlessly in the original pilot Serenity.    I've watched every episode and listened to the audio commentary more times than I can remember.   The FOX network must have been out of their minds to cancel such an excellent series midway into its run.    Buy these DVDs.   You won't be disappointed.  You will become a Browncoat.
B000008EXZ|4.0|i orignially told myself i would never listen to this album considering it didn't have ritchie blackmore on it but i finally did get it and i was wrong. tommy bolin is indeed a worthy replacement. this is defintiely my favorite out of the david coverdale albums as this is almost completely composed of rockers except for the last track(stormbringer had too many ballads that didn't go anywhere). this isn't by any means as good as \\"in rock\\" or \\"machine head\\" but if you are a hardcore deep purple fan i would definitely check this out.

B000641ZA4|4.0|There have been few complaints so far about some of the rather drab videos of the band just sitting and pretending to play their instruments. But if you really want boring videos (though charming is a strange way), check out The Police.  <br />Overall this is a very solid collection of music videos, well worth the money and there are more than enough visually artistic pieces in there to warrant many repeat viewings. However, they could have done a lot more with this. As has been mentioned many times before, there aren't any bonus features, which isn't a huge deal. My problem with this collection is the lack of Peter Gabriel. Sure, I understand they probably didn't shoot any videos during his time but why not just sync a studio cut over some live videos like they did with a few in this collection? The inclusion of THREE Ray Wilson-Genesis videos causes the whole deal to make even less sense. I know they were videos, I know it was \\"Genesis\\", but they're just unecessary, especially when you completely leave off the greatest era of the band. <br />All that ranting aside, this is worth the purchase, very entertaining.
0307276902|4.0|I bought this AFTER the \\"expose' \\". Knowing many people who have gone thru rehab or need to, I found it rang true in respect to what an addict is, how he views treatment,and how the treatment works. Part of addiction in the people I personally know, is they have honed the skill of lying....so why are we so surprised by this book? AND I daresay that those in the know re:publishers or whoever it is who figures out what constitutes a memoir should have picked up on it as well.I heard that he actually tried to sell it as fiction initially and was turned down. I would love to know if that is true. I liked Mr. Frey's style of writing. It was very different from anything else I have read. For that reason I will buy his next book and hope that he continues to write. This was a satisfying read no matter the hoopla. It is a real life look at what addiction does to not only the addict but all those who surround him. I truly hope Mr. Frey does not allow this to set him back....he has truly come far. Buy this book.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|We had grown used to Ridley Scott missing in action when it came to story concept, plotline and story elements.  He seems to have gotten away with these shortcomings because his taste for visual aesthetics is peerless.  He is one of the few working directors whose grasp of visual beauty is constant and always gratifying. <br /> <br />In Gladiator, we are once again surprised because the grapevine said that the script was not really finished at the start and it kept changing with more than one writer in the pot mix.  Indeed, the Gladiator story is superficial and the concept as old as the hills of Rome, but one can hear an old song once more beautifully rendered.  Unquestionably, this is a beautifully realized film.  It has all the elements, including a great lead player and solid supporting cast.  Here, we bid good-bye to Oliver Reed, who died with three scenes left undone.   The scenes are not missed, but some of us will miss Reed.  <br /> <br />This DVD, especially the Extended Edition with lots of background features, is a keeper, thanks to an extraordinary filmmaker and company. <br />
044024157X|5.0|I started reading The Last Juror knowing only that it was the latest Grisham book and with that I had certain assumptions of what the book would be. Boy did I under setimate this book. Sure it is about a trail. Sure the \\"Last Juror\\" is in peril of some sort. That is where all my pre conceptions stop.  <br /> <br />This book is filled with such colorful small town southern characters all written with such admiration, devotion and love that I couldn't help fall in love with every character and this small fictional town. <br /> <br />The last page had me in tears, which I REALLY did not expect coming in to it. If you are looking for the suspense and pace of The Firm, this is not your book. But if you like great characters and not too worried about when you get to the 'meat\\" of the story, then this book is for you.  <br /> <br />I really loved this book and can not recommend it enough.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Since the late 19th Century film paralleled the development of the comic strip in the United States generally conceded to be The Yellow Kid then The Katzenjammer Kids quickly following (originating in Germany and arguably the first true comic strip since it entailed sequential frames).  <br /> <br />It has taken over the past one century for filmmakers to closely emulate the comic strip, here, the work of Frank Miller.  Although the script(s) here are shallow, melodramatic and outrageously exaggerated (specifically in violence) this film is well worth viewing beyond its surprising entertainment value.  The work here is startling and highly original.
B00000AFHM|4.0|Belle & Sebastian are completely unique but not at all radical. When I first heard them, I thought of them as a combination of Nick Drake and Love. I was obviously not the first person to make such comparisons, but it sells the band very short to think of their sound as simply a pastiche. Their music and lyrics can be painfully melancholic or joyously inspiring, usually in effect rather than intent. Leader Stuart Murdoch can't possibly be oblivious to the effect of his songs on listeners, but he doesn't come across as forcing emotions onto them.<br /><br />The Boy With the Arab Strap is the 1998 follow-up to If You're Feeling Sinister, which is generally regarded as the band's masterpiece. I personally think this is unfortunate, because it has become the standard by which all of their subsequent releases have been judged. Yes, it is a Great (capital G) record, but I do not think that its immediate successor or their 2003 return to form (Dear Catastrophe Waitress) are any less appealing.  But it was for many the first impression of the band spreading its patented sound over the length of a whole record, so perhaps the other releases brought with them a sense of diminishing returns. Nevertheless, The Boy With the Arab Strap is as good of a place as either of the two aforementioned records to begin to appreciate this wonderful Scottish group.<br /><br />The opening track on this album picks up where If You're Feeling Sinister left off. It is a representative B&S tale of a young life gone horribly wrong: \\"He had a stroke at the age of 24/It could have been a brilliant career\\". If that doesn't hit you where it hurts, you will soon be wishing that Murdoch weren't so sincere when he sings lyrics like \\"he is dribbling spit tonight\\" and \\"he wets himself for the final time\\". These lines might sound gimmicky or corny when read, but Murdoch's voice is too honest for one to not take him seriously. (These things happen when one has a stroke, right?) \\"A Summer Wasting\\", on the other hand, is a cautionary tale of how, as George Bernard Shaw would say, youth is wasted on the young, or by the young, as the case may be. Clearly, there is little on this record to boost one's spirits, except maybe the fathomless truth and bittersweet beauty of the songs.<br /><br />Most of The Boy With the Arab Strap is made up of what fans expect from B&S, and love them for, represented nicely by the hat trick of tracks that close the disc: the lovelorn melancholy of \\"Chickfactor\\", the guitar-driven \\"Simple Things\\", and \\"The Rollarcoaster Ride\\", which continues the story of the Judy, whose dream of horses closed out the previous record. One could say that this CD starts and ends where the other left off.  However, they are not afraid to pull a few tricks to keep their sound fresh. Thus, this is not really a holding pattern for the band, but even if it were, it would be a hell of a pattern to hold. One particular standout is the spoken-word \\"A Space Boy Dream\\". Not only is there the wonderful, Scottish-accented narration, but also the staccato, Bitches Brew-like trumpets. (Decorative trumpets also adorn the uptempo ode to nocturnal emissions - ? - \\"Dirty Dream Number 2\\".) But the more important addition are the female vocals, which in hindsight are conspicuously absent from If You're Feeling Sinister. Although Stuart Murdoch is the main songwriter and is thus the best interpreter of his own lyrics, his songs lend themselves nicely to female vocals, be they lead (\\"Is It Wicked Not To Care?\\") or backing (\\"Sleep the Clock Around\\"). In short, TBWTAS isn't simply more of the same.<br /><br />Few musical treats are as enjoyable, wholesome, and ultimately life-affirming as Belle & Sebastian at their best.  B&S is not the type of group for whom failure to break new ground is a shortcoming.  Music doesn't need to be groundbreaking when it is as damn near perfect as this.  In fact, the best compliment that can be made about any of their CDs is that it sounds like all the other ones.  That is what fans count on Belle & Sebastian for: to deliver a full serving of invincibly delicate, childlike pop treasures that wouldn't exist but for the fact that they create them for us.  And even if IYFS is a \\"better\\" album, there are things on this record that can't be found on that one.

B00015YVDG|5.0|I have seen this movie before, a few years age and liked it very much.  I seen it again on a channel on TV however it was edited quite abit. <br /> <br />Therefore I decided to buy my own copy from Amazon.com, however, when I recieved it it would not play in either one of my DVD player (I have two).  I looked at the DVD to see if there was any scratchs or dust on but could not see any (but my eye sight is not as good as it us to be).  So I put it with my other DVD's that I don't watch and forgot about it.  I would realy like to have a copy that played, I paid for it, but I guess sometimes you get faulty items it the mail. <br /> <br />If you can help me with this I would apreciate it very much. I have't beem able to view the DVD since I bought it. <br /> <br />Thank You, and if you need further information you may contact me at my E-Mail address or call me at 775-289-4893. <br /> <br />Thank You,  <br />Garry Beckwith
B00008R9M0|5.0|Anyone trying to bash this movie is wrong. If you are considering buying or watching the movie... DO IT!  They could make 10 Men in Blacks and as long as Tommy Lee and Will Smith are paired together, you'd find me at the theater.  They ar fantastic together.  I was a huge fan on the first and am not at all dissapointed with the second. I might even like it more.  So ignore the negative reviews and make a move on MIIB.  Get the superbit edition, it looks amazing!
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Can't get enought knopfler; wish he would do more compilations with guitarists (like the late chet atkins, nottingham hillbillies, etc).  Just can't get enough.  One of the truely great guitarists out there today.
0525948023|5.0|This is an absolutely fascinating book!  I gained some perspectives that made a big difference in how I experience my life, today.
B00006WUWQ|5.0|The Autsin Powers Collection is a very good buy.  If you enjoyed the first, second, or third and have not seen the others, than you are missing out.  I highly recomend if you like comedy than you should buy these three movies.
0451526015|4.0|I had to read this book for english class i wasn't sure if it was going to be that good but i went and read it anyways. Ahead of the chapters that i was suppose to read in class but that didnt stop me. I really enjoyed this book Wilde is a very great writer. The only thing that bothered me was too many gay refrences but that made the book strong somehow. weird. As i got into the book i came to conclude that Dorian was nothing but a sponge sucking in everything he could know.<br /><br />Dont read chapter 11 it would bore you to sleep. But the rest was good. What got me into this book was the fact that im an artist too and it made me think alot.<br /><br />Pick it up it's worth a try.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I'll try to keep this short, but bottom line is this: Patrick Doyle is a GENIOUS!!!<br /><br />I've been a Harry Potter fan since it all began, so I have a set imagination of how things will be.  The Goblet of Fire soundtrack by far exceeded all expectations and weaves beautifully with my imagination of the wizarding world!!!<br /><br />I loved John Williams' first three soundtracks, but Patrick Doyle passed him right up!<br /><br />From the eccentric beginning in \\"Story Continues\\" when the title shows on screen, to the fun and life presented in \\"Quidditch World Cup\\", to the fun and way-to-go additude of \\"Neville's Waltz\\", the magical and adventurous end of \\"The Maze\\", the heart wrenching music of \\"Death of Cedric\\", and the tender and bitter-sweet emotion conveyed by \\"Another Year Ends\\" that we can all relate with so well when saying good-byes, Doyle's work is AMAZING.<br /><br />Let's not forget my favorite track \\"Harry In Winter\\", which plays not only when he's going to run into his love interest, but also plays during the credits.  I remember leaving the theatre at 2am on a freezing night with that song echoing outside, and the stir of emotions it brings to me everytime I hear it.  It's BEAUTIFUL piece, and the strings deliver it so well.<br /><br />Overall, I am SO pleased with this soundtrack.  It has brought to life emotions inside of me that have been asleep for years and years.  I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0743487583|1.0|this book was soo boring i stopped reading it because the book took forever to get somewhere. WASTE OF TIME!
B000AY74OG|4.0|The movie itself was forgetable and didn't seem to have a very solid story line. The 'I like to Move It' song was very catchy. Too much thinly disguised adult language.  The 'Penguin Christmas Caper' extra is very funny and gives it an extra star in my rating, otherwise I would have gave the movie only 3 stars.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Excellent movie!  Bought for my daughter (21) and she loved it too!  Sent in a timely manner and would buy similar item (Shimamoto)again.  Thanks!
1593072937|5.0|As far as Marv's story goes, this adds just a few more points to the character!  Just as good as it was in the movie if not better.  Once ya read though it, you'll understand.
B000001DQI|5.0|This is an excellent copy. I am very please with the product and the delivery time that I received the CD.
0385486804|5.0|I enjoy the way timeline set up in the story.  The mystery of why McCandles went into the wild attracted my curiosity and tried to finish reading the book in no time.
B00005LANG|5.0|This album is simply perfect. The tempo and mood flows throughout the album at an excellent pace. Every song has a messeage or meaning that is universal, anybody could and should be able to relate to it. I recommend everyone to listen to it, even if you have declared that you hate reggae give this a listen. Bob Marley was one of those unique artists who never recorded a bad song, and this is one of those rare albums where everysong is a classic in every sense of the word.  <br />One Love
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Once you have had the opportunity to watch the 6 fantastic documentaries that accompany the film version of RENT, you'll soon see why this movie was a \\"great tribute to a great artist.\\"  That artist is, or more aptly \\"was,\\" Jonathan Larson - the writer and composer of this wonderful musical, which is one of the biggest hits in Broadway history.   <br /> <br />I've been a big RENT fan for years now, and I was eagerly awaiting the film version's arrival.  When I walked out of the theater after seeing it, I was so hyped about what I had just witnessed on screen.  It was a beautiful portrayal of Jonathan Larson's vision of his life and times in New York City as a struggling, but very talented artist.   <br /> <br />Chris Columbus did a very admirable job adapting this musical to the screen, and although some RENT fans have voiced their displeasure in the movie, I must disagree.  Sure, there are some things that have been either left out or altered from the stage version, but this has happened in every movie version of a musical.  Plus, it happens whenever a movie is spawned from a book - as so many are.   <br /> <br />People always complain that they aren't seeing every little moment, character, or line of dialogue up there on screen.  Oh well!  In my opinion, I think they are being a little too critical.  They should take the movie for what it is.  As long as it's plenty entertaining, and the things that are left out don't diminish the overall story too much, then the director has done a good enough job.  Chris Columbus respects Jonathan Larson and his work greatly, and if you watch the documentaries, you'll see that Jonathan's parents and sister are very pleased with the film version.  If it's good enough for them, then it's good enough for me. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this to any fan of musicals, and especially those fellow \\"RENTHEADS\\" out there.  You know who you are!!!  Thank you Chris Columbus, and more importantly, thank you Jonathan Larson.  You brought the world a great musical story and gift when you brought us RENT!
B00008WG3U|5.0|it is way to good. Every single song (except Decomposeur) is amazing. Songs like Seperation of Church and Skate and Regaining Unconsciousness are the best because A. they are fast and energetic and B. the political lyrics are outstanding. Any song on this album could easily have been a single. One of the only NOFX albums you can listen to from start to finish. In my opinion NOFX just keeps getting better and this is definately no exception.
B000007R1M|5.0|This is an absolute perfect album from one of the most influential groups in the world. Everything from techno to rap to synth pop comes from here.  But let's take it a song at a time.<br /><br />1. The Robots-Kraftwerk's best song. A salute to the world of industry without actually being industrial. When Kraftwerk play this song live, they have mechanical robots made in their image play it \\"for them\\".<br /><br />2.Spacelab-This one doesn't work so well. The cheesey special effects sound like a dated sci fi movie.<br /><br />3. Metropolis-Good but not quite that interesting.<br /><br />4. The Model-Hands down classic made even better by Big Black's cover of it.<br /><br />5. Neon Lights-Kraftwerk's studio was in a seedy red light district so what did they chose to write about? The neon lights of course (what else?). The vocals are too over the top but the music captures a shimmering portrait of a lighted city landscape.<br /><br />6. The Man Machine-Perhaps their most minimalist song and it works. Turns Philip Glass' Music in Similar Motion into a pop song with teutonic tendencies.<br /><br />I've heard that reissues are on the way so we'll get to hear even more. Can't wait.
B000000OQF|5.0|this is, by far, one of the greatest albums ever! it rocks the whole way through in that hand pumping, headbanging kind of way. from beginning to end this is awesome! actually, there's no point in writing a review. if you don't own this you're either 8 - 10 and can't afford CD's and your parents suck (cause anyone that age should have parents that own this) OR you're a retard.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Wow!!!  I expected this to be yet another attempt to grab onto the medical drama boot straps of ER, but boy was I wrong.  People, this can stand on its own.  Don't hesitate you won't be sorry.  If your not sure, catch it on ABC Sunday nights at 10.  It'll speak for itself.  I'm fairly addicted.
B000002H97|2.0|this album is not good. enough said.
B000000XB9|5.0|These must have all been #1 hits. They bring back so many good memories.
B000002H6C|1.0|cliff burton is dead and it shows. don't buy this.
B000000XBC|5.0|Great sequel to volume #1. If you get #1 this is a must have.
B000002H2H|5.0|this is the best thing that has ever come into existence. this is the album that really got me into heavy music more than anything else. it starts off brutal as hell and just slams down a path of pure energy (vodka) soaked aggression. this came out over 20 years ago and is still better than everything since. i mean, there are some things that come close to being as good, or better, and i tend to forget that sometimes. then i'll put this on and remember why i used to call metallica my favorite band. this is definately a desert island disc in the truest sense. i could listen to this one album for the rest of my life and be completely pleased.  <br /> <br />if you're smart you'll buy the first three metallica albums and never even think about purchasing a single thing that they made after cliff died. everything else is a waste of money.  <br /> <br />people that still like the current incarnation of this band are either super super super stupid, took way to much acid at one point and don't even know what's going on, or they suck. plain and simple, this band isn't good anymore, but this album is. buy it.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|With the movie still fresh in my mind, the sound track brings back each scene with clarity. Gustavo Santaolalla's original score and songs are exceptional. I had never heard any of his music prior to this, but now I am certainly going to buy more.The cd's was delivered promptly and is everything I expected from Amazon. Thanks
0307276902|5.0|If you read this as fiction, it is a great book. Who knows what is true or not in this account. This is surprisingly like watching Fox \\"News.\\" <br /> <br />
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is a favorite movie, a gift for a loved one.  Very pleased.
B0009MWEN0|4.0|yes!!! i review the starship troopers umd mini for psp.
B000E1155E|1.0|Arctic Monkeys are playing to a full house because bands preceeding them have managed to fill the stadium. <br /> <br />It's already said and done. This seemingly great band owes its success to an already established buzzing sound. Just one of a handful of scavenger bands (late in the game) that will strip the meat clean off the musical bone, before the trend\fashion dies out.  <br /> <br />So before you believe the \\"best album\\" announcements, ask yourself, how could such an insignificant, uninspiring, lacklustre, non-influential album be so.
B000068OCS|5.0|We saw K when it first came out in ~1984, and clearly remember leaving the theater feeling like we had withstood a firehose on full for over an hour. The relentless barrage of images and intense musical structure left us emotionally and physically drained, but fully satisfied at having seen one of the most amazing movies ever created. I could not have been more excited to see it finally out on DVD, and find it as exhilarating but poignant now as in 1984.
B00005QFE5|5.0|I love this movie.  Die (Zhang ZIYI)is a simple, innosent persant.  Yet, she's got a strong will when she fell in love with the newly arrived teacher.  The red papercuts that she made meant a lot.  It showed how earnest and serious she was about his return.  And ending was very touching.  This is a movie I would like to recommend to everyone (especially Asians).
B0000TB01Y|4.0|The music is great and came from a great show.  Purchase transaction was, simple, efficient and delivered promptly.
B000BRBA8S|3.0|Well, I did't really get the meaning of the story.  Zhang ZIYI looked pretty.  But it's a bit too long.  Infernal Affairs was much better than this.
B00003CY6M|4.0|Do you like meeting people in unusual circumstances?  If so, you will like this film!  John Cusack is at his finest.  Will tug at your heart strings........Loved it!
B000002U82|5.0|there was no precedent for this album and nothing like it since. the mix of ambience, melancholy, beauty, longing, intelligent lyrics and tight playing is almost unparalleled. a thousand shoe-gazer and psychedelic bands have tried but never matched it.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|When first purchasing this cd, I was a little skeptical, but after the first listen, I was hooked! Great driving music, and although there may not be a lot of substance to this cd, it is a great listen, and well worth the purchase. Goes back to \\"old\\" Madonna, without all of the kaballah/spiritual crap...just great music, that  you can listen to on your car on the way to work....mindless fun!
B000006TRV|4.0|the best rock opera ever (yes, better than Tommy), this complex tale weaves elements of syd barrett's life with elements from Roger Waters' past (plus of course imagination). More often than not the writing and playing is inspired. Not as tight as Dark Side' shimmering but opaque surface but more approachable and human.
B00006LHYC|5.0|I like this CD is her first in english and she did really good, the translation of some songs she already had in spanish to english are pretty good It's not goodbye my favorite
B00004BZ16|5.0|the clash overreach with this album that shows them moving way beyond the stark punk of their first album, but who cares! way more hits than misses with songs like crooked beats, charlie don't surf, guns of brixton, lost in the supermarket and on and on. few bands could play so many genres (punk, rockabilly, reggae) with such genuine passion and authority. <br /> <br />classic!
074322454X|5.0|I purchased this book after seeing the mini series about 4 times.  Usually one expects more from the book as the shows are never quite the same. <br />I fell in love with this book, so much as though I read it straight from start to finish, I just could not put it down. <br />This book should be text for all high school students around the world and I know that I will be introducing my children to it one day. <br />Definately worth the money.
B0000CDL93|5.0|this set is so much better than the 2 vhs tape collection that was available in the early 90s.  the picture quality is superb and it also contains a bonus dvd.  the bonus dvd contains commentaires by kevin costner, oliver stone, the real jim garrison, jim marrs, and fletcher prouty aka x.  there's also secret photos and documentaries surrounding the jfk assassination...so if you love history or movies that uncover real facts then this dvd set is something you should get!  i am thoroughly pleased with this set and highly recommend it to anyone!!
B0000524CY|5.0|Being a huge horror movie fan, I've seen hundreds of horror movies but not one of them, besides this movie, ever made me say \\" I will never watch this movie again!!\\". I give this movie 5 stars only because no other movie has ever come close to the horror The Exorcist portrays. I've seen other \\"possession\\" movies but none hold a candle to the horror of this film. I must admit that for a 1973 film, the special effects are outstanding. Linda Blair, as young as she was, actually did a wonderful job portraying Reagan, a young girl possessed by the devil. The beginning of the movie is quite boring until we see Reagan's bed start jumping all around. From that point on, we see her go through a battery of tests trying to figure out what is wrong with her. You really feel for her mother who has to witness the terrible things happening to her daughter. There are scenes from this movie that are forever sketched in my mind unfortunately! From her head spinning around, the awful devil voice she speaks in, the green eyes with the scariest face I've ever seen, spitting up pea soup in a priest's face, her levitating above her bed, her bedroom being so cold that \\"smoke\\" actually comes out of your mouth, her taunting of the priests, her throwing a priest out of her bedroom window, and the worst to me being the part where she is sitting there covering her mouth and laughing at it all. The exorcism ritual is awful to watch when the priest throws holy water on her and her flesh opens up. The language also in the film is horrific. With her speaking in different languages, it adds to the creepiness of the movie. Another awful memory is when she sits up in her bed and we see the devil behind her. Ewwww[...] I'm getting the creeps just writing about this. The only good thing about the movie is that the exorcism is sucessful and she has no memory of what happened to her yet she hugs a priest at the end of the movie when she and her mother leave the home. Of course there have been sequels andprequels to this movie but there will never be another movie that even comes close to scaring the \\"devil\\" out of you like this movie does. Definetly not a movie for children to watch. Talk about nightmares! For anyone who has not seen this classic horror movie, just beware!! It's not a movie for everyone and many people who have not seen this movie might be really effected.... like I was but.......never again!!!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I really thought this is one of the best musical movies I have ever seen. I loved everything about it. It is enjoyable for everyone. I really was surprised by Rosario Dawson. Who knew she could sing so well? Well the only thing I don't like is they cut out \\"goodybye love\\" which is one of my favorite songs. Othere than that, it is so good. Highly recommended.
B00028HBKM|4.0|After hearing so much contraversy about this film, I was anxious to view it for myself to see what all the contraversy was about. I saw The Passion Of The Christ at the movies ( sold out of course ) and left the theater very moved by this film. Mel Gibson really delivers in this film. My hat's off to him for having the courage to make such a film. I own the movie Jesus (2000) staring Jeremy Sisto and think this is a fabulous movie and Jeremy Sisto was the perfect choice to portray Jesus. He gave an outstanding performance! I also own Jesus of Nazereth which is a excellent film staring Robert Powell portraying Jesus. However, Passion starts with the final 12 hours of Jesus' life. The movie starts with him praying in the garden and being tempted by Satan ( who in this film was actually portrayed by a woman ). We see Jesus stomp on the serpent that Satan has let loose..showing Satan that he will not be tempted and will continue to carry on the whole reason he was put on this earth. James Caviezel who portrays Jesus in this film delivers an outstanding performance. Even though the movie is not spoken out in the English language and you have to actually read everything that is said on the screen, it does not take away anything from this movie. Gibson wanted Jesus to speak in his native tongue of Arabic making this film more special to me. I must say that it is hard to watch all the beatings and torture that Jesus had to endure before his crucifixion. This movie really touches you.... especially the scenes between Jesus and his mother Mary. We can see the love Jesus has for his mother in the scenes when he is carrying the cross to the crucifixion site. Every time he sees his mother, it seems to give him more strength to carry on and carry on his purpose. The crucifixion itself is hard to watch for it makes you really realize the suffering Jesus went through for our sins to be forgiven. Some people might not want to watch this movie because of the violence and blood but wemust realize that this actually happened and in my opinion, we should all see what our Savior did for us. This is a well written, well acted account of Jesus' final hours on earth and worth owning in my opinion. No one will ever forget Mel Gibson for giving us this film and for opening our eyes to the real Passion of Christ.

B0001FR3IQ|4.0|What a awesome movie!! Halle Berry gives us a unforgetable performance as Dr. Miranda Grey and Robert Downey Jr.! is excellent in his role as a fellow co-worker of hers. Miranda's life seems perfect until it all comes crashing down around her. Miranda is a criminal psychologist in a psychiatric ward at a penitentiary for women. All is fine in her life until she leaves work one night and has to make a detour due to road closure. When Miranda sees a girl standing in the middle of the road, she crashes her car but is unhurt and concerned about the girl. After rushing over to the girl and speaking to her, Miranda's whole life changes. She awakes to find out that she is being held in the same psych ward she works at accused of brutally murdering her husband. Miranda must now do everything possible to prove her innocence. She herself must try to keep her sanity while being heavily medicated while seeing ghosts and being visited by spirits. This movie is edge of your seat entertainment from the very beginning. An excellent, well written movie with great surprises and twists. For horror fans, thriller fans and suspense fans, this is a movie to own if you haven't seen it yet. Simply a great great movie!!
B000002UB3|5.0|My 21, 14, and 8 year old all love the album. Each has their favorite selections. The 14 year old used a few songs to describe events happening in the book The Tales of Narnia(his own sound track) <br />Need I say more!!!
B00005RHGK|3.0|This movie is pretty good. Two teens are on their way home on an isolated country road when almost run off the road by an old beat up, yet cool, truck. Thinking they have seen the last of this truck and the crazy person driving it, they continue on their journey only to pass in front of an old church where they see the same beat up truck and someone who seems to be throwing a body down a large sewer pipe. They decide to investigate and when one of them falls down the sewer pipe, he discovers a den of horror. Now being seen by the killer, they must run for their lives. This movie delivers in both horror and gore. Not a boring movie and well acted. I recommend any horror movie fan at least rent this movie if you have not seen it yet.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a grown up movie this much since \\"Tie me up tie me down\\" another movie that, on the surface, could easily be seen as porn, but is not.<br /><br />The people are real, their reactions are totaly believable and their confusion is not only faithfuly portrayed, entirely understandable but presented without judgment.<br /><br />I couldn't take my eyes off them. powerful acting by a brilliant and funny cast.<br /><br />If you don't 'get' this movie, check your funny bone.
0316172324|4.0|Even though this book starts off with a bang, I did not find the information conclusive. Based on anecdotes, the book lacks empirical data. Gladwell points out that once we have acquired a significant amount of information in a particular field, then related decisions tend to be more accurate.  His \\"thin slicing\\" concept is worth a read. I recommend the author's previous book, The Tipping Point.
B00007BHOE|5.0|I knew about Slipknot, but never really listened to them.  I recently bought Iowa and liked it.  So I bought this DVD.  I took it home, put it in the DVD player, and when the band started playing, stood in my living room with my mouth open, completely frozen.   <br />     What a show.  Wow!!! <br />     If you are a fan of the band, you'll totally dig this.   <br />     My wife doesn't appreciate Slipknot at all, I showed her about thirty seconds of People = S**t.  She sat there with her mouth open and then said, \\"This is a total spectacle.\\"   <br />     The sound is great.  The video has too many quick edits, but it fits with the music.  <br />     This is excellent. <br />     Buy it. <br />
B00000JHAU|5.0|This band has amazing beats...it reminds me SO much of my childhood  and listening to bands like REO Speedwagon and Toto...it's a great change from anyone's normal music taste...It's very calming and happy...Definitely and must-have for long car rides...One song I can't get enough of is \\"The Blues Are Still Blue\\" this song is great and the lyrics are fun...Definitely buy this cd and others from Belle and Sebastian if you're looking to reminisce of those calm and cool days!
B00005MP58|5.0|Having read the novel, as is usually the case, I've been consistently disappointed by subsequent movies.  That is until now.  This movie version is true to the form and intention of the novel in everyway.  I was visually transported to the era of the characters and very much enjoyed the time travel experience.  Bravo!
B0000696I0|5.0|I've loved the Ninja Turtles since I was old enough to watch TV, so I automatically love anything to do with them.
B0000029PC|5.0|Fantastic set, one of my favorite of a huge pile--the one I seem to go back to most frequently.    If you buy this and the CDs are in non-removable cardboard sleeves inside the packaging (they should be), CAREFULLY take the discs out and put them in jewel cases for the remainder of their (or your) lives. The idiotically designed packaging actually scratches up the discs--primarily the second one (the glued inside (!!) seam rubs up against the surface). I'm meticulous with my CD handling and discovered, to my horror, that this has happened with nearly every set I own in this series!    I've encountered worse elsewhere--trendy avant-garde labels are the worst, they might as well package CDs in sandpaper or include a crowbar [If the moron who designed the breathtakingly idiotic packaging for the KAIROS Morton Feldman disc ever reads this, be warned, I will track you down someday and ruin your career as a designer]; it's amazing that at this late date in the evolution of the CD packaging designers still haven't developed the right sensitivities or simply yielded wholly to the imperfect but better-than-anything-else stock jewel box. Why that ingenius package that would actually automatically lift and free the disc when opened never caught on (despite the added 10 cent per unit cost, that I, for one, would gladly have absorbed) is anybody's guess.    [Post note: Amazing, I publish this solely to cue people that there's a problem with the packaging on this and I get a \\"not helpful\\" vote! What a putz!]
630460291X|5.0|I have a bone to pick with you!!  I paid $14.99 (RobinHood: Price of Thieves) for this movie and it has sub-titles on the whole movie.  I tried to remove them and no soap.  So whatever vendor you have in your list that sent this moive to me should make this moive good and send me another one without sub- titles.  I also have two others I purchased from you with the same problem.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|When I went to see this movie, I really did not expect to like it.  And you know what, I didnt like it - I Loved it.  I thought it was hilarious, as well as a wonderfully animated.  Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy have not been this good for a while.  I loved the fact that it brought in all the story book characters for my childhood and made them all a little kookie to boot.  When they said they were going to make a second part, I had to admit, I was sceptical, but that was just as great as the first, maybe even a little better thanks to Antonio Banderas and Puss in Boots.  Don't knock the movie becuase you think animation is only for kids.  This is a movie that an entire family, from a 5 year old to a 50 year old can sit down and enjoy together.

B0001BKAEY|2.0|When I first saw The Matrix, I was just blown away with the story.  I thought it was original and compelling.  The action was just fantastic to watch, so I was excited that they were going to make 2 more parts to the movie because the first one doesnt really explain what happens to Neo.  The second one, all though not as good as the first, had some really great action in it which made the movie for me and right then I just knew that while they had a really good story to develop, they were in it soley for the money and I knew the third was not going to live up to what could have been.  But of course, I went to go see it, along with all the other Matrix fans (who probably also new this was going to suck as well).  What a major let down.  This movie easily is in the top 10 of the worst movies ever made.  While I liked the whole Anderson duplicating thing, everything else was just junk (except for the fights, which are still pretty good even though the special effects went down a notch).  And what a disappointing last fight.  It was taken straight out of the DragonBall Z cartoons (which I really dislike).  Again, what a let down.  What could have been a great trilogy because a joke in my eyes.  Spare yourself the frustration that comes with watching the death of the orginal Matrix movie.
1881273156|5.0|Gary Chapman hit the nail on the head with this book.  You will find you true love language and your spouse's in this easy read book.  I suggest this self help book to every couple married or thinking about marriage. Communication is the only true way to a relationship's survival.
076790592X|5.0|As a student at a small engineering school, sometimes the important things in life are put aside as dreams of making money, getting good grades, and being successful are being followed.  This book was given to me by my best friend.  She said it was a reminder of what is important to me.  All I can say is I didn't put down the book in the two hours that it was started and was in tears as I realized how much I had let the little things go in my family and close friends in the last year.  I remember now why I choose this top engineering school, and why being a resident assistant was so important to me.  I am truly inspired by this story and will be giving copies to my family and all of my friends.  Give this to a friend and they will thank-you for life.
B00097DX3U|1.0|I dont like listening to to Chris Cornell sing on Out of Exile because it reminds me of Soundgarden.  I dont like listening to Tom Morello play guitar on Out of Exile because it reminds me of Rage Against the Machine.  I dont like Chris Cornell telling me he likes breaking guitars because it doenst remind him of anything because its BS just like this band, as though he's never seen The Who.  The whole damn thing reminds me of how gutless musicians are, to make bland, predictable pointless music thats totally similar to what they've already done over and over for ten years.  Audioslave doesnt remind me of anything creative or original.

2070518426|5.0|I need to learn French really well for school, but reading scholarly articles and dull books gets boring after a while.  A friend recommended I check out the Harry Potter books in another language and enjoy reading something that helps build my vocabulary, particularly in more common communication patterns, and offers a fun way of getting used to medium grammar.  And she was right!  What a fabulous idea!  I love Harry Potter, need to speed up my reading in French, and see new things about both the language and the plots that I wouldn't have otherwise seen. <br /> <br />I do have a few cautions, however.  The wizarding/witchcraft vocabulary that abounds in the books will be of little obvious value in the real world.  But looking them up in the first quarter or half of the first book will get rather frustrating unless you know the books forward and backward and don't need to look them up.  But the vocab is surprisingly varied and difficult and will help anyone not fluent in French.  The vocabulary is, on the other hand, generally pretty straightforward.  So anyone with a semester of college study or a year of high school study will be fine.  Even this may not be necessary, but I find my patience tested in looking up vocab all the time, and I've taken 5 semesters of French and have read much more for research.   <br /> <br />Still, anyone looking for a fun and challenging way to practice their French should look into buying them in another language.
1401307450|4.0|Anthony Kiedis accounts for the major events in his life, from conception to present-day and isn't afraid to sugar-coat any of his experiences.  Anyone who enjoys the Chili Peppers and would like to get a little background on some of their songs as well as a glimpse into the soul and feeling of the band will enjoy this read.  It takes you on a roller-coaster ride, from the highs of being high to the gut-wrenching lows of having to get high no matter the cost. <br /> <br />Overall, Scar Tissue presents a stunningly fresh, honest view of the hard-partying lifestyle of rock music as seen through the eyes of Red Hot Chili Peppers wild frontman Anthony Kiedis.  The only drawback is that certain aspects of Anthony's life aren't filled in; some events tend to jump from one to the other with little transition, but overall it is a very interesting read and well-worth the 400+ pages.
074325144X|5.0|I stumbled on this book by accident while researching Tai Chi books.  I am so glad that I did!  It's a well organized and fun to read book. It opened up a whole new realm of running to me.  I ran for years and competed in small five and ten mile races and my longest event was a half marathon.  I hurt my knee chasing my dog and was then reduced to walking and thought I wouldn't be able to run again. I missed running horribly, the world doesn't go by fast enough when you walk, if you are used to running.  But the chi running book teaches a technique which utilizes different muscles, a different stance which is easier on the body and does not consist of pounding.  The author has carefully enumerated an excellent technique to alleviate and prevent injury.  Not only does it make sense to me as a long time runner, but it feels right when I do it and it's fun!  The other day I was able to run 2.7 miles, it felt great and the next day I had no soreness, no knee pain, nothing but exhiliration and anticipation of my next wonderful run. I am slowly working back up to five mile runs. I would recommend this book to experienced runners who want to improve their techniques and spare their bodies injury, and I would recommend it to new runners who could start out with good form and minimize their lifetime chance of running injuries. I would also highly recommend it to injured runners like me and older runners (also like me.)  You wouldn't think there could be anything new in running, I was pleasantly surprised, delighted even!
0670033375|5.0|It's really multiple books in one; a history of 5 or 6 ancient civilizations; a history of 3 or 4 modern civilizations; a \\"state of the world\\" (circa 2003) on what the (12) major issues are facing the world in the next 50 years; an overview of the mining, timber and marine fishery industries (history, problems, solutions, future); a fascinating narrative of life in modern Montana; a highly focused and up to date annotated bibliography (best bibliography I've seen). All tied together with the common theme that people today are little different than people of yesterday and the lessons of the past are applicable to our future, specifically focused on environmental issues and the fate of human societies. That's it, not a complicated book, no grand theories like in GGS, it's a better book - the lessons are timeless and nothing new, just presented in the language and framework of the problems of our time. Diamond is a wise sage with unique life experiences whose insights are a treasure.
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|The first thing you notice after listening to this album is what a god awful vocalist julian casablancas is. He no longer has the clever production to muffle his voice on this one. He ends up sounding like some depressed karaoke singer after a few too many drinks on some of these songs. His wailing becomes unlistenable at times (\\"on the other side\\"). Of the 14 tracks here there's maybe 3 good ones (the first 3), another 3 or 4 decent ones and the rest being b-sides at best. They can still keep a good rhythm i'll give them that, but the vocals, lyrics and guitarwork on a whole is uninspiring.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|This movie, although well made, was a little too liberal with the emotions of the characters. I went in to see the movie feeling that I would not like Kiera Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet. I didn't think she could pull it off as intelligent and composed Lizzy and I was right! This movie is still watchable since I am big fan of anything  of Jane Austen's. Stay away from the movie unless you are a Pride and Prejudice devotee.
0783226845|5.0|I remember when I visited New York City for my birthday in March,1992 that I had the opportunity to catch the film crew from this movie shooting a scene with the Ferrari down Fifth Avenue. When this movie came out I went to see it and enjoyed the film tremendously. Al Pacino delivered in his role of Lt. Col. Frank Slade. The same can be said about Chris O'Donnell as a caretaker college student, Charlie Simms. The relationship between these two get off to a shaky start but as the movie progresses things get better. The big surprise is a Thanksgiving weekend in New York unknown to Simms.A weekend at the Waldorf Astoria, a visit to Frank's estranged brother and of course the tango scene. I saw this movie again recently and it gets better every time. This is the movie that will make you say \\"Hoo-hah\\" at the end! You'll enjoy this!
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I've always loved Mariah Carey,  ever since she stepped out onto the music seen in 1989 with her very album,  self titled<br /><br />\\"MARIAH CAREY\\",  I've followed her career from then till now & I've got to say that this album is her best work yet,  especially the song \\"We Belong Togather \\" & \\"Don;t Forget About Us\\"... I've got a feeling that shes going to be around for a very longtime & I just hope that her music just gets better & better.  If your thinking about purchasing this album or any other album or even movies that shes starred in,  then I recommend that you do,  you won't be sorry,  especially with this album, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is all that & then some!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was an Emmy-winning 2002 science-fiction TV show that only lasted 11 episodes, followed by a major motion picture sequel,  Serenity. It is more \\"pure\\" sci-fi, much more realistic and gritty than Trek or Wars. It's adult, edgy, violent, and sexual, with lots of cool science-fiction themes and special effects. There are no cute kids, except one in the movie, and he gets slaughtered. But the show is not dark like Battlestar Galactica and has life-as-value as its central theme. It's got a minor Western theme going on some planets (diminished severely in the movie,) but also a frontierish, John Wayne-style sense of morality, including independence, free-thought, self-sufficiency, and right-to-live-freely. It's basically the Star Trek  formula, but so highly advanced in terms of presentation (characterization, plot, sets, science, politics, effects, etc.) as to be a revolutionary rather than evolutionary advance.  <br /> <br />Did I mention it's great?
B000E2AZ2C|5.0|They say there are at least seven different versions of Blade Runner out there.  I have seen at least four of them.  SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />1) Original theatrical version with Harrison Ford voiceover narration and \\"happy\\" ending which featured landscape footage that Stanley Kubrick cut from the credits of \\"The Shining.\\"  This was shown at the end when Deckard and Rachael made their escape and he said there was hope that she would live.  They say they showed the film to test audiences who didn't \\"get it,\\" so they made Ford come back to the studio to narrate it.  He didn't want to, so he delivered it in the flat, deadpan voice on purpose.<br /><br />2) This version, which \\"contains scenes of graphic violence edited from the theatrical version.\\"  THIS IS THE VERSION YOU WANT!  Aside from the \\"director's cut\\" this is the best.  It has the same as the theatrical and MORE.  It shows an extended version of Harrison Ford gunning down the first female replicant, a longer and more brutal fight between him and Pris, and Roy Batty kills Tyrell and we get to see his thumbs poke out the man's eyes. That's about it, but it is worth it if you watch the narrated version.<br /><br />3) A 10 Year Anniversary which is not much different than the above two.<br /><br />4) The director's cut which trims the \\"graphic violence\\" footage, removes the voiceover narration, adds a unicorn scene (taken from footage of Ridley Scott's movie \\"Legend\\") which suggests Deckard might be a replicant (as does the original Philip K Dick book), and trims the landscape footage at the end, stopping the movie where Deckard and Rachael flee.<br /><br />Rumor has it that there will be a special edition in 2007 which includes the original version (which of the two I'm not certain), the director's cut, and a new director's edition which nobody seems to know what it will contain.  They've been talking about this for years so I'm not holding my breath. Still, this remains one of my favorites.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|This series is a wonderfully written, cleverly scripted enjoyable experience.  The casting is superb, the clever dialogue is great and the story lines - simple, pure, but compelling.  Love all the years.

B0001907DA|5.0|I seen Police Academy a hundred times it is one of my favorite films of all times.  Police Academy is compared to the movie Stripes and An Officer and a Genteman.  These cadets are the real cops on the police force, because they care about the people and don't care about what people think.  Mahoney and Hightower did a great job in this film, they are like Eddie Murphy from Beverly Hills Cop, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence from Bad Boys and Mel Gibson from Lethal Weapon 3 and 4.

B0000029GA|4.0|Nas has made music that tells the story of the streets, a story he tells better than most men with camera's and actors.  Unfortunately, the attention span required to go from recognizing this as an album of tracks to appreciating Illmatic as the ill-crafted masterpiece that it is doesn't grow on trees.  Take the third track, for example, who's closing muted trumpet moans the theme of \\"Life's a B****\\", but which leads the attentive listener to understand why knowing that life's a b*t*h will let a man find that the world is his.  There's an order to this album, no doubt about it ; Nas had studied his lessons, and knew the science when he put it together.  But on the other hand a true review of this album should not ignore the fact that Nas was already torn : <br /> <br />I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive <br />When I was young, I was a fan of the Jackson 5 <br />I drop jewels, wear jewels hope to never run it <br />Wit more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach <br />Nasty Nas has to rise, kid, surprise <br />This is exercise til the microphone dies <br />Back in '83, I was an MC sparking <br />But I was too scared to grab the mics in the park and <br />Kick my little raps cuz I thought niggaz wouldn't understand <br />And now in every jam I'm the f***in man <br />I rap in front of more niggaz than in the slave ships <br />I used to watch C.H.i.P.S, now I load glock clips <br /> <br />Any literary scholar would have a field day respecting and detecting the images, metaphors, and memories that Nas has woven through this verse, but when he starts by saying that all he does is relax and strive, and finishes by saying that now he loads glock clips ... This is a problem that Nas has never resolved in his career, and one wonders if he couldn't have made an album just as true without pretending he still needs heat to survive.  Case in point, check the brilliance on the first verse from One Love, where Nas breaks down prison life and relating to heads behind bars with the stroke of a pen and smithing of a syllable, while at the same time leaving that same past behind : <br /> <br />its not funney <br />what up kid? i know s*** is rough doing your bid <br />when the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib <br />but f*** it black, no time for looking back it's done <br />plus congratulations you know you got a son <br />i heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you? <br />told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper <br />flippin, talk about he acts too rough <br />he didn't listen he be riffin' while i'm telling him stuff <br />i was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too <br />f***ing with the niggaz from that fake crew that hate you <br />but yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece? <br />jeromes niece, on her way home from jones beach, its bugged <br />plus little rob is selling drugs all the time <br />hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9's <br />and night time is more trife than ever <br />Whattup with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together? <br />if so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest <br />say whassup to herb, ice and bullet <br />I left a half a hundred in your commisary <br />You was my nigga when push came to shove <br />One what? one love <br /> <br />Prescription?

B000002UJQ|5.0|To say you don't like this album out of spite is ridiculous. Even if you don't like the genre of music you can't deny that this album is if nothing less, very interesting musically and lyrically. It may not be completely original but that does not make it any less good.  <br />When I first purchased this album in 1997 I hated it, no joke. It took 10-15 listens before it started to grow on me. This is probably the experience of many who listened to this record. But of the thousands of albums I have listend to in their 'entierty' none have sounded sounded so good, or have captivated me as much as Ok Computer has in the past 7 years.  <br />pretentious, overated......come on, did you actually listen to the record? <br />Any music fan would agree that Radiohead did something special with OK computer, and although it may not be 'everyone's favorite record, it is nonetheless a damn good album deserving of a few listens!

B000002AGN|5.0|If you do not own this wonderful CD, Buy It Now.  Dave Brubeck's Time Out is absolutely timeless, light-hearted, melodic classic jazz that goes as well with a Martini as it does with red wine or even 12-year old single malt scotch.  It is, in short, good times waiting to be unleashed.   <br /> <br />The signature song, Time Out, is still a such a vibrant piece of music today, nearly 50 years after its initial 1959 release, that it remains a frequent request on college campuses, old school piano bars such as San Francisco's Top of the Mark, and was recently featured as the background music at a White House reception on TV's West Wing.   <br /> <br />This dazzling, tantalizing collection of music is a must for jazz aficionados, and for anyone who wants to add a little spice to their music collection...
1878424505|5.0|This book has influenced me greatly in the months since I have tried to apply the Four Agreements in my life. The four agreements are simple in nature, but hard to implement.  <br /> <br />For example, the first agreement: Be Impeccable with Your Word, encourages us not to speak badly of others or ourselves. How easy is it to talk about someone at the water cooler at work, or to get angry at a driver who cuts us off. However, if you think about it...who are we hurting? The person we talk about? Or ourselves? This agreement is somewhat common sense if you think about it. If we are known to gossip or talk behind others' backs, people will not trust us, which will hurt our ability to reach our own goals. <br /> <br />The other agreements contain a similar logic and simplistic beauty: Second Agreement - Take nothing personally; Third Agreement - Make no assumptions; Fourth Agreement - Do you best. Simple to understand, but hard to apply. However, the effort will be worth it. <br /> <br />The Four Agreements can be applied and used by people of almost any religion, philosophy, or creed. Whether you believe the Toltec philosophies within this book or not, the Four Agreements themselves are self-evident in their wisdom and utility in improving our lives and helping to increase happiness and peace while reducing stress and pain within our minds and hearts. <br /> <br />My only small criticism is that the writing is sometimes difficult to read at times, as at times I found Ruiz's writing to be rambling. However, the message contained within the words is important and this observation should not take away from the power of this book. <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly.
0316172324|2.0|To start with the positive, this book is very well-written and hooks you in.  The author makes great use of interesting stories to highlight points or lead into new discussions.  Unfortunately, the stories end up being told to lead you down a very specific path.<br /><br />This book is marketed and touted as being an interesting psychological and science-based discussion of the power of first impressions, gut reactions, and/or intuitive thought.  However, the book fails miserably in the credibility department once the reader realizes the author's social/political agenda.  After spending the better part of half the book making the case that snap judgments and shoot from the hip decisions are the key to a better life and more efficient workplace, Gladwell then plays the cards of racism and sexism to suggest, that these sole areas are reserved for careful thought and reason.  Gladwell acknowledges at the end of the book in the acknowledgments that one of his motivations for writing the book was his concern for racial stereotypes.  He is half black apparently, and was razzed by the police a couple of times in New York city because of his afro.  Seriously, he talks about this at the end of the book.<br /><br />If Gladwell wants to write a book about race relations, that is fine.  But this book is really a load of pseudoscience laid out to make the case that people need to watch their stereotypes.  That last argument is a valid one, but after reading this book I felt that the presentation and marketing of the book was very misleading.  In the end, \\"blink\\" does not make the case or provide any real evidence for the proposition that initial impressions are consistently better than logic and thoughtful decision making.  In fact, with all the discussion of racism and sexism, Gladwell shoots himself in the foot and explains just how unfair, foolish, and even dangerous it can be to try and analyze a situation in the \\"blink of an eye.\\"

This is an incredible instrumental with one of the best rythm sections in music, proving Carl Palmer is one of, if not, the best percussionists of all time.<br /><br />Then, we have Still... You Turn Me On, another one of Greg Lake's ballads.  Greg Lake always wrote incredible acoustic ballads, but this most definitely falls as his best.<br /><br />Next comes Benny the Bouncer.  This is a very wierd track, but I've always been a sucker for wierd  songs, so I love this one.<br /><br />And now, the masterpiece.  My second favorite ELP song and my third favorite song, Karn Evil 9 is...  This monolithic composition is one of the most incredible, most daring pieces of music in Rock history.  It flows through insrumentals and sung stories, and includes the classic line \\"welcome back my friends to the show that never ends.\\"  This alone is worth anything at all.<br /><br />Emerson, Lake, and Palmer were genius's of their time and still are today, and this album is a testament to that fact.
B000AP04L0|5.0|Rather than comment on the film, I'll comment in the disc itself.  Worthwhile set of extra features, but it's not an action film so the widescreen doesn't add much.  A note on the 'Digital Locker' content: 1.you may not be able to view it. 2.it may lock up your browser. 3.the deleted scene is on the disc anyway. Summary:  Buy it if you like Office Space, not because of the widescreen and Digital Locker content.  BTW although it's zone 1 NTSC it played just fine on my zone 4 PAL DVD player.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|I completely concur with, the other positive reviews of this film.  It may appear to start slowly, but in time it develops as an intelligent and measured film.  There is a bit of manipulations at work in the beginning, but by the time the gig is up the viewer will be deeply engrossed in the plot. <br />  Stunning cinematography, and a wonderfully paced adult thriller.
B00D6QUJ6U|4.0|What exactly is this new SD-BluRay format from Eagle Rock Entertainment? That was my question as I waited four weeks for the release of an old concert- the Bee Gee's One Night Only- billed as such. In this case the concert, which was originally released in beautiful standard definition video with imperfect audio, (the complaints were about the center channel audio) would do well to be reissued with improved audio.<br /><br />What a disappointment. The only reason you should buy this so called SD Blu-ray is if you must have the concert in 16:9 aspect ratio to fill your large TV in the right proportion. Eagle Rock did not bother to improve the audio in the center channel and the picture quality of this disc is inferior to that of the standard definition DVD. The well performed concert deserves much better treatment.<br /><br />Hold on to your SD-DVD if you still have it. If Eagle Rock has more concerts in the pipeline in this format they can forget about issuing them for I won't bother to buy any more. Good thing I did not order this disk for express delivery.<br /><br />A note: I had to delete an earlier review in order to post this one, hence the date of February 2006 above. Today is August 3, 2013.<br /><br />UPDATE, February 2015: It turns out the audio is mislabeled on the disc. For DTS, all speakers audio select the 2 channel LPCM option on the disc instead plus LPCM audio on your amplifier. This error was on the DVD release and it was not corrected on the \\"Blu-ray\\" edition.  You'll like the concert much better when you do.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|The idea is not exactly original, there have been several film versions of the story, even the fictional plot line of the ill fated lovers seems to be a virtual copy of the 1937 Jeanette MacDonald, Nelson Eddy film \\"Maytime\\" (right down to the ghostly re-union),yet director James Cameron has succeeded in creating one of the true \\"Hollywood\\" entertainments of the past decade, a film which will become part of the human mythology as films such as \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and \\"The Sound of Music\\" have done.This latest Special Edition DVD transfer finally does justice to that achievement, with stunning picture (in 16x9) and sound transfers (in both Dolby and dts) and, depending on the which version you buy - the 2 disc, 3 disc or 4 disc version, a wealth of fascinating and sometimes amusing extras. This truly is the version that should be in the collection of any serious DVD collector or movie fan and certainly preferable than the original DVD release.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This movie is and utter waste of time. I am usually a big fan of comic book adaptions, but this is mind-bogglingly bad. The plot is either A. utter incomprehensible, or B. so bad you wish it was A. If you want quality entertainment, then Teen Titans, an ANIMATED CHILDREN'S CARTOON, is better than this.

B00005JO1R|4.0|Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix shine in an otherwise typical biopic. While similar to the extrodinary Ray, Walk the Line never rises above movie adequacy. The cuts are too frequent to connect you with Johnny Cash's problem or his recovery. Witherspoon gives the performance of a lifetime as June Carter (Cash). She lights up the screen whenever she arrives and the movie is more than worth watching just to see how talented she actually is. <br /> <br />The music is great too, and Phoenix does a terrific job of nailing Cash's warbling, toned voice and his unmistakable swagger.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love the series, and hope it will come back to the small screen, but this movie did manage to fill a void for a little while.  But mostly, it made me miss the series more.  Again, the writing, the characters, the story line, all superb.  The only thing missing was the theme song.
6304712499|2.0|What trips me out is that most of the principle charecters were black in the comic book and cartoon.  This is what you call covering their bases and to make it a PG-13 movie was the wrong move.  That why a lot of people went to see Blade because it wasn't a PC type movie.  Spawn lacks the level of violence and taboo storytelling that the previous efforts have.  I wasn't impressed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a shame there were only 14 episodes; 14 of the best written, most well developed characters of a first season EVER!  That must be why Fox canceled the show, it was too intelligent for them.  Guess they best stick to the real money makers, like Skating with Celebrities and American Idol.  (I think I just threw up a little bit).   <br />Anyway, best series ever.  It has left me wanting more, and empty inside!

B000002H97|3.0|Don't get me wrong I love Metallica, and I am really into them as a band. I also, like the \\"Black Ablum\\", which shows a lighter side of Metallica....will I ever love it NO! The \\"Black Ablum\\" is obviously the most popular and is loved by millions of people around the world. Yet, in an esscence it just doesn't seem like Metallica as it was back in the early Thrash Metal days,... tearing it up with ablums like \\"Kill em' All\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Ride The Lightning\\", and \\"...And Justice For All\\",.. the golden years of Metallica.  <br /> <br /> The \\"Black Ablum\\" as some people call it is a masterpiece in it's own way,... Metallica is and always is Metallica no matter what they do...but in this ablum they play focused more on song writing, production fundumentals, and being more mature than less raw. So basically they traded in one style to try out another. True they did become a bunch or corprate basket cases,...sueing fans and possibly changing their style to be more popular, but past that its a good piece of work a little soft fo my and alot of metal fans tastes, but I love sheer craftsmanship of the ablum and how nicely it flows. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the ablum include the super smash hits \\"Enter Sandman\\",\\"Sad But True\\", and \\"Wherever I May Roam\\"... with the masterful ballads \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\". I also admire the song \\"The God That Failed\\" which was a pretty good jam with a nice solo. The rest is around and mostly above average. They could have done more with some of the songs, but overall it's a rather strong \\"Hard Rock\\" ablum.  <br /> <br /> Yeah, folks I said \\"Hard Rock\\"...true Metallica are mostly known as \\"The Metal Gods\\"...which refers to their early stuff... \\"The Black Ablum\\" is an hard rock ablum... just compare one of their earlier thing to this. They do go back to metal with the release of \\"Load\\" which in fact was a very good ablum, not old school, but still great. <br /> <br /> This record in general is bittersweet, the\\"Beginning of The End\\", being the first major milestone... which led to the abomination \\"St. Anger\\" which was a mess. Yet, some of their stuff like \\"Load\\", \\"Reload\\", and \\"Garage Inc.\\" weren't totally bad, but \\"St. Anger just popped in the mix and screwed it all up. No mattter what your opinion this ablum changed Metallica forever,...whether for the better or for the worse. It's all opion based, yet all reviews are I'm just telling you the facts...! <br /> <br /> Overall, I give this a 3/5 good ablum, yet just not the same as the Metallica I know.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|These are my favorite songs on the CD:     Jump - Beautiful song about taking risks and believing in yourself. This should have been the lead single, or at least an upcoming single.     Isaac - This is probably my favorite song on the CD because it is so meaningful and has a wonderful sound. This song has lovely background music, with a Middle Eastern flair. I am certain Madonna had to fight like hell to get this on the CD.         Some of my least favorite tracks on this CD:     Hung Up - This is such a dead-end song that doesn't have any substance and should not have been the \\"lead\\" song. - What happened to lead Madonna singles such as \\"Live To Tell\\" \\"Like A Prayer\\" \\"Erotica\\" or \\"Music\\"...?     Sorry - This is another song that lacks any substance. Some of her accents in the beginning of the track are just plain laughable.     I Love New York - She doesn't love NY, she just knows this song will fit in with all the other deadbeat tracks. Instead of being provocative and taking the high-road Madonna has decided to write songs like this?

She \\"goes to Tiffany's\\" whenever she feels herself getting depressed, which can be seen as a metaphor for the way she lives her life-- she surrounds herself with what she can't have to convince herself that she is worth the unattainable. I won't give away the two major twists in the novel, because i want you to read it, cheer for her, and cry with her, without knowing what will happen.  If you enjoyed or identified at all with Catcher in the Rye, you will love Breakfast at Tiffany's.
0790731452|5.0|Mars Attacks is one of the most underrated movies ever. Critics gave it a thumbs down (what do they know?), but as a satire of Sci-Fi invader movies it was pure genius as well as an introduction to future star Natalie Portman. Stars, former screen, sports, and music stars (Jack Nicholson seemed to revel in his duel roles and Martin Short was an obvious parody of George Stephanopoulis) shared the screen with hilarious little aliens with evil intentions and a sick sense of humor. P.S. If you hate politicians you can laugh along with Grandma at the Congressional session scene.
B0006399FS|1.0|first, i would to say this is a terrible, terrible, terrible album ever! U2 always shout like mad ppl in some of their song, i hate it much! They should not get 5 grammy this year b'coz there's a lot of quite good album and song deserves to get the awards. I think some who give five-stars to this album are the same person!

B00005JNQA|3.0|\\"The Interpreter\\" has an interesting story: an interpreter for the United Nations, played by Nicole Kidman, overhears an assassination plot spoken in a language she and very few other people understand.  Sean Penn plays the U.S. Secret Service agent assigned to investigate the interpreter and see if she did hear what she says she did. <br /> <br />\\"The Interpreter\\" is Sydney Pollack's first film since 1999's flop \\"Random Hearts\\".  Pollack's directing is one of the two high points of the film.  The other is the cast.  Kidman and Penn are both very good and, paired with Pollack's directing, they keep the film going. <br /> <br />Other than those points mentioned above, the film has little going for it.  About fifty minutes through the film I was sick of it.  There's very little originality in the film; it's cliched and predictable.  I felt like I was watching another dumb thriller. <br /> <br />I don't have much to say about this film.  I thought it was a dull, cliched thriller, simple as that.
0312995423|2.0|I have read other books by this author in record time, but I honestly could not finish this book. It does not have the level of suspense of the other books and is not as well written.  Read this book of his last (if at all).
B0000DDAU9|4.0|Lord Chimp cites Thomas Hobbes below when he philosophizes about Mastodon's \\"nasty, brutish, and short\\" primitivism here.  This is definitely complicated by _Leviathan_, the album after this one, with its thirteen-minute magnum opus \\"Hearts Alive.\\"  Still, Lord Chimp is on to something.  Leviathan is thinking person's metal; I will bring up Schopenhauer: \\"Deviation from the arithmetical correctness of the intervals, through some temperament, or induced by the key selected, is analogous to the individual's departure from the type of the species; indeed, the impure discords which give no definite interval may be compared to the misbegotten offspring of the union of animals of two different species, or of the union of man with animal\\" (_World as Will and Idea_).<br /><br />That's Mastodon in a nutshell, taking [...] time signatures and notes and melding them together into some ungodly sort of uber-beast.  The terrifying union between the prehistoric mammoth that is the mastodon and the raging horse on the cover of _Remission_ creates an awful mean spawn, one that cracks your skull on first contact with a vicious slab of sound like \\"Crusher Destroyer.\\"  Just monolithic riffage and head-spinning discords that emerge at the drop of a dime with the kinds of grunts that hover in the low-end of the scale, right there near the death-metal edge of what Schopenhauer would call the mineral world of bass harmony.  Since there is the intimation of melody and some excursions (not so many!) into high-end with the guitars, this brings Mastodon into the animal world.  The carcass of the mastodon always threatening to revivify to crush destroy anomie, always caught between the mineral and the animal world, shaking off the calcified remains.<br /><br />The musicianship here sets them well apart from their nu-metal and otherwise compeers, Brann Dailor's frantic drumming giving them an unbridgeable gap ahead of the competition.  While this extremely visceral experience is great for many daily activities (cleaning the house, pumping weights, beating your chest like Tarzan), it isn't 'til the more cerebral bells and whistles of _Leviathan_, where the mastodon mates with the white whale, that Brann Dailor turns into the Tony Williams of metal and puts the unsettling celestial chimes in motion that makes the coupling of earth and beasts take off to metaphysical reaches.  Still, _Remission_ remains an unremitting document of a metal behemoth that rose from the South to make sure that extreme music would not be the sole domains of those who do not know the true nature of the extremes of the earth's core and the farthest pulses of Cygnus X-9.(cleaning the house, pumping weights, beating your chest like Tarzan), it isn't 'til the more cerebral bells and whistles of _Leviathan_, where the mastodon mates with the white whale, that Brann Dailor turns into the Tony Williams of metal and puts the unsettling celestial chimes in motion that makes the coupling of earth and beasts take off to metaphysical reaches.

B000002UJQ|5.0|The where will always be those who bash a true work of art. The previous reviewer mentioned, a rating of 5 stars being given to one of Lavigne's CDs. Although I agree that OK Computer deserves 5 stars, but such a rating will likely be given only to meaningless albums such as Lavigne's. Songs about \\"sk8r bois\\" do not mean enough to draw criticism of any kind. <br /> <br />OK Computer, is one of my all time favorite albums. It never gets old. Usually with a CD I will feel the need to skip some tracks, but every single track on this disc is superb. Every single song serves a distinct purpose in the album--there is no superflous material here. No one song could be sacraficed without doing damage to the album. <br />There is a distinct progression in Radiohead's albums. Kid A was a reaction to OK Computer, and Amnesiac to Kid A. However, aut of Radiohead's albums, this one is perhaps the most balanced and easy to appreciate.  <br /> <br />Although these songs are easy to appreciate, they are by no means simple. These are some of most complex songs in modern rock, yet not overdone. There is no Malmsteen-esque shredding of guitars, no pretentious overuse of electronic elements. <br /> <br />This music is not driven by instrumentation. Much radio music would be nothing if one took away the crunching electric guitar riffs, or synth bass line. Not so with OK Computer-- these songs are beautiful played on piano, or just acoustic guitar, as Thom Yorke and Johnny Greenwood have proved repeatedly in live performances. Being such, they bear the test of time. <br /> <br />The sound quality of this disc is great. The songs are flawlessly recorded, and made exactly what they were written to be. This disc is obviously a perfectionistic work, not a sloppy recording at all. <br /> <br />Whatever critics may say, this disc is not an attempt to be cool, artsy, or hip. OK Computer is  merely an attempt to make good music, and it succeeds.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00097A5HW|5.0|I liked this CD better than anything else that came out in 2005.  That's really saying a  lot since I didn't understand a word of it.  But what I did understand was that Shakira is not just another pretty face with no talent.  She is light years beyond all of the Ashlee Simpsons and Christina Aguellieras that fill the airwaves.  Shakira could hold her own with anyone.<br /><br />What Rick Rubin has so wisely done,  as he often does,  is strip away all of the over the top production and just let the pure talent shine.  He did the same thing with Johnny Cash a few years back and gave him his best music in years.  I highly recommend this CD to people of all ages.  This CD reminded me of the great music of Sergio Mendes and Brazil 66 in the mid 60s.
B000001FSU|5.0|I bought State Of Euphoria the night of FuMaR's inevitable last show.  When I popped that sucker in, I was instantly hooked by that awesome cello intro on Be All, End All.  That celloist, without a doubt, must be on the top 10 list or something, it is that good.  Anyway, Anthrax's SOE is my favorite album by them or anybody, and it will remain so for years to come. I will give you a rundown of all 10 amazing tracks right now. <br /> <br />Be All, End All  - A catchy tune that will leave you begging for more cello. <br /> <br />Out of Sight, Out of Mind - This song proves that Scott Ian is metals worst, and yet best, rythm guitarist out there. <br /> <br />Make me Laugh - my second least favorite track on SOE <br /> <br />Antisocial - my least favorite track on SOE <br /> <br />Who Cares Wins - this song contains Dan Spitz's best solo in his entire career, I am listening to it right now and it is good. <br /> <br />Now It's Dark - Incredible.  This song has an outright addictive shout-a-long chorus and a sort of off tempo verse. <br /> <br />Schism - my favorite song on this Cd and by Anthrax in general. Spitz's breaks out the arsenal on this one. <br /> <br />Misery Loves Company - This song showcases Charlie Benante's best drumming performance in Anthrax.  He really knows how to use a china. <br /> <br />13 - A funny little break from the madness until... <br /> <br />Finale - Anthrax's best closer to date.  Scott Ian craps it up with the best rythm in the land.  Guitar virtuoso Spitz's whips up some big cheese.  Charlie pounds his bass drum of doom.  Frank Bello thumps his bottom of steel.  Joe Belladonna tears his vocal chords of chasmatic chaos.  I love Anthrax. <br /> <br />In short - This is Anthrax's BEST album.  If anyone wants to talk about how bad it is compared to Among The Living, I dare you to listen to this album twice for everytime you listen to ATL. This is Dan Spitz's and Charlie Benante's best musicianship ever and I love it.  Over, finished, gone,done, out. <br /> <br />The JMAN

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This is a wonderful adaptation of the Jane Austen classic.  It really does a nice job of not going too far over two hours, because with certain movies that don't move as quickly as others, it is very difficult to sit through them when they are too long.  The acting is very wonderful in this, but I am disappointed that the Academy did not consider Donald Sutherland for the supporting actor category instead of maybe Paul Giamatti.  I like Paul Giamatti, but I have a feeling that the Academy wanted to make up for not nominating him for his better role last year in Sideways.  Sutherland does not have many fiery scenes, but his mild manners and his modesty in this film just made me very excited to watch him in this role.  The rest of the acting is pretty good for this remake.  Kiera Knightley does not extremely impress me in this, at least as much as in Domino, but her acting suffices for this.  I shouldn't expect to see her accepting the Academy Award for Best Actress, but we should see her cheer Reese Witherspoon on.  The story is fantastic, and if you enjoy Jane Austen, then you will no doubt love this remake of one of the most popular novels in English Literature.  Very well done. (4 1/2 stars)
B00005JOFO|5.0|The sight of nature's landscape shows that undisturbed country exists.  Brokeback Mountain is the film shows this example.  Indeed, the landscape speaks to the viewer that this is God's country, which is untouched and uncontaminated.  The film differentiates between natural landscape and one that is defined outside of human nature.  The characters of Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) blend with the natural landscape where there are little or no boundaries except the boundaries they create between themselves.  However, once they leave the backcountry, they have to live with society's boundaries.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain is worthy of any high accolades because it follows in the similar footsteps as other legendary Hollywood films that possess epic qualities.  John Huston could have made this film, and John Steinbeck could have written the narrative.  But Ang Lee directed, Larry McMurtry, Diana Ossana wrote the screenplay adaption from E. Annie Proulux's narrative. It appears that most of the controversies in society tend to be overlooked in the heartland where the film takes place, Wyoming and Texas, but Hollywood tends to use the heartland as a backdrop to macro impose a difficult issue in order to see the big picture.  In this case, sexual orientation is depicted with its historical complexities that existed from the 1960s to the 1980s.<br /><br />The film's photography and soundtrack is effective throughout the film.  Rodrigo Prieto should be commended for the exceptional pictureresque mountainous scenes that took place at Brokeback Mountain, and Gustavo Santaolalla's score for the film.  The soundtrack is one to be considered for future listening.  The main themes as well as the piece \\"Snow\\" shows the tranquility of each scene in which it is played (the opening chords and melody plays similar to The Beatles' \\"Blackbird\\").<br /><br />Disregard controversy and preconceived perceptions.

This is what makes the film, and the reason why it is highly recommendable.he relationship between two people that spans twenty years.

0316172324|5.0|Many great books are ones that provide information and insights, but can be read quickly.  \\"Blink\\" accomplishes both, and more.  It's not a research book, and it's not a self-help, or awareness book.  It can, help a reader perceive things they experience in life in a better way, which can help both personally and professionally.  <br /> <br />Many concepts we are latently aware of but don't consciously think about and discuss are in \\"Blink.\\"   <br /> <br />As we progress technologically, scientifically, and medically, we humans seem to have an urge and necessity to explain, analyze, investigate, and search for the reasons \\"why.\\"  We categorize many of decisions we make, actions we perform.  We even try to elucidate our our likes and dislikes.  <br /> <br />Numerous real-life examples are noted, and they're examples most  readers will relate to. <br /> <br />An art expert can often see a sculpture and know almost instantaneously that it's a fake.  How does he/she know specifically?  Sometimes it can be explained; sometimes it can't.  \\"it just isn't right,\\" is the knowledge, but analyzing and dissecting it and then trying to verbalize an explanation, proves difficult if not impossible.  Author Gladwell notes that this is fine.  The concept of \\"thin-slicing\\" can remind one of the graduated steps of unconscious-incompetence to unconscious competence in work tasks and skills.   <br /> <br />Another example is the expert tennis coach that can accurately predict in a fraction of a second when a tennis player will fault on a serve.  He just knows.  In military campaigns, the Pentagon has long attempted to study how Generals make instinctive decisions in what's called \\"The fog of war,\\" where constant, unexpected changes,  chaos, and lack of information coincide.  Other research noted how doctors diagnose whether or not a patient is having a \\"real\\" heart attack or just suffering from chest pain.  The Docs often have too much information and this leads to mis-diagnosing.  ThinSlicing is also used in advertising, with some packaging tactics by companies noted.  <br /> <br />The psychological studies about our unconscious attitude towards race and first impressions were intriguing, relevant, and also disturbing.  Even if our conscious minds tell us to treat everyone the same, do we actually do this, 100% of the time?  Even when it adversely affects our income (costs us money)?  Most of us aren't aware, when we do this.  What lies behind the locked door of our sub-conscious has subtle yet influential ways of influencing our attitudes and actions in ways that we do not even know.  <br /> <br />The height factor: people that are tall comprise a very small portion of the US population.  But the percentage of CEOs and those in upper management that are tall is overwhelmingly high.  For every inch a person has they earn an $789 more per month.  Add a few inches that the average tall person can earn several hundred thousand dollars more over the course of ones career/working years.  <br /> <br />One study revealed that car salesmen consistently treated people extremely differently because of their age, clothes, and gender  even though these subjects reported the same income, residence, and education, and preferences on make, model, and price.  The salesmen were unconscious of their unequal treatment, and were genuinely surprised that they were even doing so.  It was actually costing them to lose money.   <br /> <br />Gladwell also points at the negative effects of \\"thin-slicing.\\"  The negative effects of incorrectly acting upon our brief thin slices and instincts.  (To me this is all-mighty \\"assumption.\\"  And \\"assumptions are the mother of all f-ups.\\")  Gladwell referred to this as 'negative Thin Slicing.'  The Pepsi Challenge: how it motivated Coke to actually change it's recipe.  But the \\"Pepsi Challenge wasn't valid, and wasn't relevant.  We usually drink more than just small a sip of cola, and we also do it without our eyes being covered.  Nevertheless it caused a dramatic and disastrous change in one of the largest companies in the world.   <br /> <br />Another negative to improper thin-slicing is the \\"Warren Harding\\" effect.  Warren Harding: a handsome man facial features, stature, and physical charisma that gave the 'impression' of power, strength, assurance and fortitude.  was likely they major factor for his nomination and election to president.  And he's rated as the worst ever. There are lots of anecdotes and few research studies.  This is OK by me, and even preferred.     <br /> <br />
0060599847|5.0|I must say that these CD's have been my daily dose of the postitive pill.  I listen to this repetively going and coming from work and have applied all the principles.  I have advanced my company, increased my gross, changed my outlook on life, attracted new friends of influence and have also turned others on to this CD.  This is a must buy and yea this was all done within 3 months timeframe.  If you are trying to attain that next level in life, than you should get this.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|My husband and I LOVE this CD. We love his music. He has such a unique voice. You just can't help but dance when you hear him sing. This is the best CD we've bought in years. We love it!!! (especially \\"Save the Last Dance fo me\\" - Awesome!)
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|My God!  I dont't know how else to describe Buddy Guy other than My God!  In order to put my review in context, I am 41 years old. I grew up listening to what is now called classic rock (we just called it rock at the time).  I always considered Buddy Guy a blues player, and when it comes to blues, I could never tell the difference between Robert Johnson and other blues players of the time.  That said, I listen to Buddy Guy and all I can think of is My God - the guy (no pun intended) is amazing.  If you appreciate music with a guitar base - then this is the album for you.
0380715430|2.0|Sorry for not being as enthusiastic as the other readers but I have many doubts about the reliability of this book. I agree there are many interesting and funny anecdotes, that the story of the English language described is captivating and so on. But as a native French speaker, I noticed that almost each time he writes about the French language that's absolute rubbish ! <br />Let's have an overview : <br />p3 : '[...]The French for instance, cannot distinguish between house and home, between mind and brain, between man and gentleman [...]'. <br />Hey Bill, if it's too hard for you to check in a dictionary I can tell you the difference between 'une maison, une residence, un btiment' and 'un foyer, un chez-soi' or between 'esprit' and 'cerveau' or between 'un homme' and 'monsieur, or even gentleman'. <br /> <br />p5/6 : '[...]French must manage with 'je chante', we can say 'I sing', or 'I do sing', or 'I am singing'. <br />Even if I prefer the English way of saying that I can also say 'je chante vraiment', 'je suis en train de chanter'... <br /> <br />p7 : [...] while the French call lice 'Spaniards [...]'. <br />Where have you found this stupidity ? I've never heard that before ! <br />p7 : [...] To be bored to death in French is 'tre de Birmingham' literally 'to be from Birmingham' [...] <br />Once again where have you found this idiocy ?! I've asked to all the Frenchmen around me and no one knew it. Perhaps you got it from the only Frenchman you know who has been bored to death in Birmingham for 10 years....  <br /> <br />p67 : [...] For instance , the French do not use [...] or R.S.V.P. for rpondez s'il vous plat. (Instead they write :'Prire de rpondre.'). <br />Hum, let me check my paperwork R.S.V.P, R.S.V.P., R.S.V.P.,... Damn I cannot find any 'Prire de rpondre'. Did you invent that one also ? <br /> <br />p179 : [...] in France [...] an alloman is a switchboard operator [...] <br />Hang on man, you're on the wrong line. I can invent a new one for you if you want : 'fantasyman'. <br />p179 : [...] so that in France a jerk is an accomplished dancer. <br />I've been dancing for years now and never used or heard that one !  <br /> <br />p210 : In French it is a grave insult to call someone a cow or a camel and the effect is considerably intensified if you precede it with espce de ('kind of') [...] <br />I wouldn't say it's a GRAVE insult ! Even less preceded by 'espce de'. Espce de menteur ! <br /> <br /> <br />So here are the examples I picked up, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same for the other languages and even for the English language. Imagine now my feeling as I was reading this book. Each time I learnt a point of history, grammar or vocabulary or I was amused by an anecdote I thought \\"hang on, is it again something Bill invented to sell his book, is it again a non-verified piece of information ?\\".  Despite all the books he wrote I think this guy should go (back ?) to a school of journalism... <br />  <br />Franck
0634049011|5.0|Been playing for over 1.5 years now.  Been taking lessons for over one year, but teaching the fretboard isn't my teachers strength.  He has been playing for 30+ years and has written numerous albums and over 240 songs.  He is actually the featured artist under review on ragmagazine.com this month. He knows scales and chords very well, but teaching the fretboard layout in general he claims is too difficult.  He wants me to learn it over time just through playing.  Well, I am not that patient so I tried this book.  After several months it's great.  I knew some information already, but learning the 5 patterns by which scales are grouped really makes the fretboard so much eaiser to navigate now.  I can find single notes or scales anywhere on the neck very quick.  If you don't already have the fretboard memorized I highly suggest this book.

B000BISBDY|5.0|Up until my purchase of this CD (for a measly 6 or 7 dollars first week at Circuit City) I had only heard about 2 Cash songs \\"Ring of Fire\\" and his NIN cover \\"Hurt\\". When I saw this on sale for such a good price I figured why not, it might introduce me to something good. I normally listen to a lot of rock and some other genres but mostly rock, I like country but I'm not like it's biggest fans. That changed once I heard this CD. Sorry to bugger on about my story, basically I'll just say this, you have two choices: if you want a \\"basics\\" compilation that has a majority of the tracks from \\"Walk The Line\\" on it, then pick up this disc. If you really want to delve into the Cash collection I also highly recommend \\"The Legend\\" box set. You get your money's worth with that one, only negative about that is it doesn't feature the American Recordings songs that he did, which is ok because I already had some of the good ones on this CD. That's my opinion take it or leave it folks.
B000002J09|5.0|tha stright up classic, Led zeppelin's fourth album is in my opinion the greatest hard rock album ever recorded along with PARANOID from BLACK SABBATH.This album is excellent value for money due to classics like BLACK DOG,ROCK AND ROLL,STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN and WHEN THE LEEVEE BREAKS.Very highly recommended.A MUST BUY. <br />
B00004XPPE|5.0|This is a classic and is very relevant to the current climate in America. The characters were reasonable men, with the exception of Walter Mattau's part as the academic special advisor to the dept. of defense.
6305205639|2.0|Metallica did this specific show to film for a video, so did they choke or what? Most of the renditions on this video are lackluster and butchered. And what the is the deal with them only play two and a half minutes of \\"Master of Puppets\\". The band does do better on the second have of the show, but 50%, even 60% effort is unacceptable, especially for a video.<br /><br />Pros: The second half of the show is much better than the first. It is still Metallica live.<br /><br />Cons: They sure did choke or something because some of the songs are brutal and almost painful to watch.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Save your money and buy \\"Live Sh*t Binge and Purge\\" or \\"Cliff 'Em All\\", both of which feature far better performances unless you need to have all of Metallica's videos.
1573223085|5.0|Daniel Pink is to be commended for this insightful and intellectually compelling look at the enigma and change surrounding our current technological and global predicament. The concepts found in the book are both profound and life changing. Daniel Pink has given us significant data and insight to support the next trend -- \\"big thing\\" in our society and workplace. Failure to read this book is failure to take responsibility for yourself and your future.
B0007ACVHI|5.0|I bought this on a whim and because I wanted the cello suites on a single release without spending an arm and a leg. Wow, what a great performance. Maria Kliegel is excellent on this, as is the quality of sound. A great cellist, great Bach, great CD set. This is worth every penny and then some.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Two words are enough for this product: horrible, terrible. The worst CD I've ever heard (at a friend of mine). You can give me 100 Dollars and I would not take the album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Dont forget to watch Serenity at the end, then write the network a letter asking them to Bring Back the Series!!!!
B00005JKNF|4.0|Gosford Park is one of those movies that were made for those who enjoy sketches of Britain's high society, this particular one during the 30's. It shows people with different social status and with a wide range of backgrounds, all gathered and Sir William McCordle's mansion for a grouse shooting party (during the weekend). <br />Among the the servants, gossip flows wildly, whilst the guests go on with their affairs and their rumping. After all the charming mumbling and dribble, Sir William is murdered. Not that anyone misses him, except Elsie, the maid, with whom he had an affair. Sir William's wife patters after one of the servants who, in the end, turned out to be an actor, who was just \\"learning the tricks\\" to play a butler in a movie. <br />Charming film for people like me, who love samples of best thing in Britain: high society mumbling. <br />This film is not one of Agatha Christie's \\"whodunnit\\" sort, it is more like something that began in that way, but it got \\"twisted\\", in Altman's so caractheristic way. <br />Its a good film, on the whole, although it can become a bit depressive, especially the end.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|Man I wish they would bring back the Series....   Hopefully not the last movie!
B000JSI7AI|1.0|I am so sick of studios releasing these so called \\"special editions\\" DVD Sets right after they release the original version. The Original DVD release of Brokeback isnt even a year old and this so called special edition really doesnt have that much extra from the first version. Where are thr deleted scenes and the commentary from all the stars? and the Postcards? many people are not aware of this but these so called collectors postcards were originally available for FREE during the 2006 Oscar Season when the Studio included the postcards in a Daily Variety Magazine during the Oscar Campaign Season! These postcard are LEFTOVERS! Dont waste your money on this blatant attempt to rip off people like me who truly love this film! Save your money and wait until they release the 5TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, THE 15TH ANIVERSARY EDITION, THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, ETC ETC!and to the Makers of this DVD Set, I CAN QUIT YOU!
0679805273|5.0|I've been told this is a popular gift for graduating seniors from high school and college, as well as children. Makes perfect sense to me. At any age we can identify with wanting to move mountains, and Dr. Seuss tries to give the child in all of us words of inspiration. We can also identify with getting caught in a slump, and Lord knows, 'unslumping' oneself is not easily done!

B000BJS4SU|5.0|The music scene has been seriuosly lacking any explosive debut CDs for a long time.  The John Mayer Trio's TRY! CD turned my head instantly, we really need someone to at least TRY! to carry the \\"music from the soul\\" torch (the other greats passed before their time).  Buy this CD!  It will be a tragedy for us all if John Mayer has to quit the Trio gig to bust out radio-friendly pop songs so his people can make a gazillion dollars.  Encourage the man!  Brilliant CD John thank you!
0671319809|5.0|I am huge fan of David Weber. This is the 3rd copy of this book that I have bought as I re-read the series often enough paperbacks eventually start to fall apart in my hands. #5 keeps up the high octane pace and give a reader a different cultural point of view in the Honorverse.
0783225547|4.0|You know I was thinking there's that scene in \\"War of the Worlds,\\" no, not Cruise-o-matic but the original with Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, where three or four townspeople want to make friends with the alien monsters. Everyone in the theater knows they're about to be turned into ash. And they are. Now that's just moronic . . . . but it must work because it's in every disaster movie since they began. Let's make friends with the ebola carrying monkeys, with the raptors, with the great white sharks, with the blood thirsty natives. Doesn't matter.<br /><br />But it plays into the \\"greedy businessman\\" genre that's so common in disaster flicks. It's like Mayor Murray Hamilton in Jaws, \\"let's let the kids play in the water with the 18 foot white because we need the concession business.\\"<br /><br />So it's really expected that the townspeople will get upset with Pierce Brosnan when he tells them, \\"bad news, life as you know it is going to change real soon.\\" It's a formula story, reluctant love, boiled teenagers, some mercenary chopper pilots and obstinate geriatrics, and redemption of sorts. As one young reviewer said, it's a great volcano movie. But it ain't \\"War and Peace.\\" 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B000001ELP|4.0|\\"Music From 'The Elder'\\" is the most maligned KISS album ever, even by Stanley and Simmons.  Their biased (but, hey, it's their work) opinion reflects the poor sales and response to the highly experimental album, but with the passage of time that usually gives a more fair shake at old albums without the press buzz that surrounds it at the time of release, we often find that attitudes change and works are judged more on their individual merits, not expectations.<br /><br />  Metal music is and always has been the most restrictive form of rock.  If a group did not display a willingness to branch out early on, then, in most cases, such musical evolution has not been tolerated, which is unfair, but nonetheless the nature of the beast.  Blue Oyster Cult is one of the few heavy bands that successfully worked jazzy tunes and ballads into their integral sound, thus paving the way for great tunes like \\"Astronomy\\" and \\"I Love The Night\\".  KISS, however, had a tougher road to hoe.<br /><br />  \\"The Elder\\" opens with a orchestral fanfare and the introduction to the theme of the album, a young kid selected to fight evil, yadda yadda yadda.  \\"Odyssey\\" may come off as a little pompous, but the album takes off from that point and rocks.<br /><br />  \\"Only You\\" and Ace Frehley's sole contribution \\"Dark Light\\" inject the punch to keep the music from drowning in its own pretentiousness.  \\"A World Without Heroes\\", co-written by Lou Reed, stands by itself as a great ballad, tenderly sung by Gene (!)and the only \\"Elder\\" cut that has made it onto recent KISS compilation CD's.  \\"Mr. Blackwell\\" reminds us of \\"God Of Thunder\\" and the album closes with a nifty hard rocking instrumental, \\"Escape From the Island\\" and \\"I\\".<br /><br />  All in all, KISS were a talented and smart outfit.  Had this album beared somebody else's name, chances are it would have fared much better.  The same can be said for \\"Carnival Of Souls\\", KISS' ultra heavy underrated gem.<br /><br />  Taken as a single work and not compared to other bands or previous albums, \\"Music From 'The Elder'\\" is actually a pretty darn good CD, and far better than you may be led to believe.as a single work and not compared to other bands or previous albums, \\"Music From 'The Elder'\\" is actually a pretty darn good CD, and far better than you may be led to believe. <br />      <br />

B00000DHZJ|4.0|Like many others, I firmly disagree with bix lang's commentary on the civil rights movement being \\"unnecessary\\". Here's the message I get: You're a conservative racist, which in my book is a grave insult.<br />ZEPPELINISGOD is totally clueless. He/she lacks the ability to review objectivally, and seems to have jumped on the fashionable \\"I LOVE LED ZEPPELIN!!!\\" bandwagon. But what he/she fails to realize is that Jimmy Page has cited both Hendrix and Eric Clapton (two guitarists who are leagues better, by the way) as influences. In other words, we wouldn't HAVE the Jimmy Page we know today without Hendrix. (But then, Jimmy Page is the most overrated guitarist in history that I can tolerate, so hey).<br />All right, I'm done arguing. Onto the music. Yes, there are PLENTY of good songs on this disc, and yes you should take Amazon.com's advice and buy it along with The Best of Cream, another good album especially for Hendrix fans. But after you have it, you should buy all of Hendrix's studio albums so that way you can have the several good songs that missed this disc (3rd Stone from the Sun, Are You Experienced?, Up From the Skies, Spanish Castle Magic, about half of the Electric Ladyland album) as well as Band of Gypsies. And when you're done, buy all of Cream's studio albums as well as their BBC Sessions. And give Led Zeppelin a look too, I suppose, although they're overhyped they did make some good music.
B0000A4GAK|4.0|Derek Trucks continues to blur the lines between jazz, blues, and world music.  His slide playing, always among the best around gives several standards a new twist and the bands playing is first rate.<br /><br />The record starts with a sweet taste of King Curtis' Soul Serenade seguing into Rasta Man Chant.  Bock to Bock slides into cool jazz and afro Blue is a trip to the heart of Coltrane country.  the two are sandwiched around an outstanding take on Ray Charles' Drown in My Own Tears featuring Gregg Allman doing some of his best singing in years.<br /><br />As the disc moves toward conclusion it takes some interesting turns.  The band plays (pun intended) tribute to Elvin Jones in the original Elvin.  A sweet turn on Wayne Shorter's Oriental Folk Song leads to the acoustic Sierra Leone which takes the band out with the same mood altering dubro turn that Duane Allman lent to Eat A Peach with Little Martha.<br /><br />Definately a record for those who love good playing on good songs.
B0000067L4|4.0|While it's unfortunate that Cream had to break up, at least they went out with a bang and not with a Led Zeppelin-style fizzle. In fact, I'd have to say it's my second-favorite Cream album, behind only Wheels of Fire.<br /><br />Similar to Wheels, Goodbye is half-studio, half-live. But unlike Wheels, the live material outweighs the studio stuff (Badge being the exception). First, they take I'm So Glad, which was already Clapton's jam vechile on Fresh Cream, and turn it into Clapton's Guitar Showcase. However, Jack Bruce's work with the four-stringer does rival Clapton's here. They also make Politician into a guitar jam, as they do with Sitting on Top of the World, my favorite out of the live side.<br /><br />Next, enter the studio half, starting with alltime classic Badge, cowritten by George Harrison. Like so many other Cream fans, I believe that Badge is the best song on Goodbye's studio side. The next two songs (Doing That Scrapyard Thing and What A Bringdown) are two of the strangest songs in the Cream canon. The former seems to be Jack Bruce giving his musical autobiography, while the latter is a very dark piece from Ginger Baker. These are both OK songs, but they don't match up to Badge and the live stuff.<br /><br />Overall, if you can find Goodbye then pick it up! Good luck finding it, though.

B000E1155O|4.0|Sibylle Baier was primarily an actress, born in Germany, and these songs-she was living in the States by then-are the result of the inspiration she drew from a certain road trip with a friend, which led her to write and sing this low-fi and quite private set of recordings between 1970 and 1973.<br /><br />The first thing that might strike about these songs is the consistent sadness of their melodies, akin to the mood she had been in at the time, and the hushed yet expressive phrasing of these lyrics.<br /><br />More than anybody else, this album may remind you of Vashti Bunyan, particularly her debut \\"A Diamond Day.\\" Although the Bunyan's songs were less imbued of somberness, they share a certain melancholy with these tunes. Also, you may think of what Sylvia Plath might have sound like if she chose to sing rather than poetry, more through its mood than the nature of its words.<br /><br />Still, the important thing is that this album, which had never been released before, presents a singer/songwriter of exquisite sensibility, sharing a very personal batch of songs that were never intended for \\"the public\\" and, perhaps due to that, conjure up an intimate and gorgeous portrait of a woman's inner life.<br /><br />If you are a friend of brave and intimate Folk, you will not be disappointed with this purchase.
006056251X|4.0|This is the third installment to the \\"Wallflower Series,\\" in which the most socially-inept member of the group, Evangeline Jenner, is paired with \\"rakish\\" bachelor, Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent. These two individuals would likely never have been attracted to each other had it not been for the intensity of their needs:  hers for protection by marriage (from evil family members) and his for money (her father's).   <br />     Luckily, Evangeline discovers that her husband is not totally selfish and promiscuous and Sebastian discovers that his wife is not a total doormat.  Evangeline can and does take up for herself, although at times it is difficult for her.  Her father is owner of a wealthy gaming club in London, which Sebastian and Evangeline will inherit upon his death.  The happy couple elopes to Gretna Green and returns to London, where Sebastian begins to manage the Club.  Evie's selfish relatives attempt to kidnap her and force a marriage with her worthless cousin, but that is quickly foiled (they were to annul the marriage).   <br />     There is more danger for the couple, though, from an unknown source.  This carries the plot through the second half of the book, which was the most emotionally intense.  Both of the main characters are fearful of commitment:  she due to her past treatment by relatives (and a physical rejection of sorts by her father)and Sebastian's due to the loss of his sisters and mother.  This was an enjoyable sequel that is highly-recommended.  Looking forward to Book # 4!
B000EOTAM6|3.0|Back in the day...or if you prefer the Star Wars style intro \\"a long time ago in a galaxy far far away\\", MTV used to show almost nothing but music videos. Occasionally, they would put something incredibly progressive that was also quite popular (see Bevis and Butthead, for example). Aeon Flux was one such animated series.<br /><br />The problem was, true to Asian style anime, the stories were so disjointed you had no freaking clue what the heck was going on. You just sort of sat back and watched and said \\"cool\\" a lot when something happened.<br /><br />Flash forward to this movie, and you get the \\"cool\\" factor of old, and you finally get what the heck is going on in this world. Alas, the 'ho-hum' of the story makes it so you don't really even care. Check this out for the great special effects and enjoy the style and action. Pass if you're looking for a true nod to Aeon.

Some groups struggle to make a 40 minute CD, but The Smashing Pumpkins manage to release 2 CDs in one full of a great variety of music. Plus it includes their best songs: Bullet with butterfly wings, Zero, 1979, 33, Jellybelly, etc. I higly recommend this for anyone just starting to listen to the Smashing Pumpkins or for some reason you are a fan but dont own this yet. I was very pleased with my purchase of this, every song is awesome, and you get 28 tracks! Some slow and melodic and others fast and angry, great for whatever mood youre in. I miss the Smashing Pumpkins and wish they were still around, one of the best bands of the 90's.
0061020710|5.0|I listened to this book on unabridged MP3 through Audible and my review pertains to the audio edition. <br /> <br />I've meant to tackle Terry Pratchett's massive Discworld series for years, ever since reading and loving Good Omens, his collaboration with Neil Gaiman.  I finally began with the unabridged audio edition of the first novel in the series, The Color of Magic. <br /> <br />The Discworld is a strange flat world perched on the back of four elephants and the great space turtle Atuan, who slowly makes his way through space with his burden.  The opening of the book provides a good orientation to the Disc, where directions are hubward and edgeward and with or against the spin of the disc, and magic works, and the world is surrounded by a sea that spills over the edge.  Within this world is the potential for dozens of stories, as the 30+ books in the series attest. <br /> <br />This first book centers around the barely-a-wizard Rincewind and his adventures shepherding the eager tourist Twoflower around the wonders of Discworld.  Pratchett plays happily with all the cliches of fantasy, sometimes stopping the plot for a discourse on magic or the background of a city or being, sometimes resolving a tight spot by the blatant intervention of gods in the characters' lives, none of which is met with complete surprise by the characters themselves. <br /> <br />The reader on this audio edition was absolutely wonderful.  In a plummy British accent and a semi-serious tone reminiscent of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, he tells the story and uses a variety of voices in the dialogue.  Even so it was occasionally difficult to keep the many characters straight, but I never got too lost.  I very much enjoyed listening to this book and hope to continue to listen to the series on audio.  I believe that Audible.com has most or all of the series available in unabridged editions, and Audible books can often be purchased through Amazon.com <br /> <br />I will definitely continue reading this series, and plan next to divert to the young adult novel The Wee Free Men before going back to the main series.

Plus it includes their best songs: Bullet with butterfly wings, Zero, 1979, 33, Jellybelly, etc. I higly recommend this for anyone just starting to listen to the Smashing Pumpkins or for some reason you are a fan but dont own this yet. I was very pleased with my purchase of this, every song is awesome, and you get 28 tracks! Some slow and melodic and others fast and angry, great for whatever mood youre in. I miss the Smashing Pumpkins and wish they were still around, one of the best bands of the 90's.

6304779356|5.0|The Lost Boys is a great movie overall. It provides the viewer with the thrills of a vampire movie combined with a good mixture of humor and suspense. The character casting is great, every role contibutes something to the film.
0375507256|5.0|An excellent book.  Just as you were engrossed in a story it stopped and a new very different story begins.  The cuts were similar to a director cutting to a commercial to make you stay with the story.  Since the author stopped when he did I obeyed and read the book from front to back.  I'm not sure I had to be such a slave to convention here.  I'd suggest coming to a stop in the story where you are comfortable.  The only weak portion of the book is the mystery thriller - I suggest speed reading.  People are killed by their own stupidity.  The change in writing syle is fasinating.
B00009NHC5|5.0|I was very happy to find \\"Wait Until Dark\\" on DVD at Amazon. I saw this movie as a kid when it first was released in the theatre and I can still remember the screams from the audience in the last minutes of the film. <br /> <br />Audrey Hepburn gives an incredible performance as a recently blinded woman who is terrorized by three men who concoct an elaborate scheme to retrieve a heroin stuffed doll they believe she has in her posession. The cast of characters is small but extremely talented and effective. Alan Arkin's performance as Audrey's tormentor is superb and their interaction brings this movie to an unforgettable climax. <br /> <br />This is an edge of the seat, nail biting thriller suitable for teens to adult; and the perfect addition to any video library.
1573223026|5.0|I've read a few of Nick Hornby's books, but I must admit it took me awhile to get to this one.  I just wasn't sure how entertaining a book could be when it focuses on the accidental meeting of four suicidal people....  But once I started reading I discovered it is great!<br /><br />On New Year's Eve four complete strangers meet at the top of a building with the purpose of killing themselves.  Instead of jumping off, though, they make a pact to wait a few weeks and meet again to see if life has improved.  The book is about what happens in their lives over the course of those weeks.<br /><br />One of the things I liked most about the book is that Hornby avoids an overly sappy happily-ever-after ending.  While it is a sweet book with a good ending, it is also about real people with real problems, and Hornby acknowledges that their problems will not be solved in 330 pages.<br /><br />I recommed this book - you won't be disappointed!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|With very little budget, a no-star cast and very little publicity, Joss Weddon has produced a great film with strong characters, cool SFX and a quick and whitty script.  It makes The Phantom Menace look weak and over hyped.  Buy It!!!!!!!!!
0440237688|1.0|I read this book in about fourth grade, and I absolutely loathed it. I decided to give it another shot, and once again, found it lacking. Definetely not reccomended.
0307276902|1.0|I began reading this book the day I received it, as I had gotten so many recommendation from friends that enjoyed it.  Upon reading it, my first thought was how in the world was a bloody mess of a person allowed to board an airplane.  Then of course the next day the scandal about the books truthfulness erupted.  That turned me off enough to quit reading.  I wished I would have returned the book.
B00005JLZN|5.0|Under-The-Radar film that I put off watching for awhile, and finally, almost grudgingly watched. You think it's a journey into the mind of a seriel-killer or something, no. It's actually a brilliant movie as well as a 'taut' thriller.<br /><br />Not what I expected at ALL. And it's just a Blow-you-away (with a brain) movie. We're lucky that solid people like Alan Parker don't care about political crap and just do what they love to do, make a good effing movie that makes you think a little. And even though it's totally gone by un-noticed, I'm glad he did it. And thankyou to the writer who gave a special gift in the writing.<br /><br />Extremely well written by Charles Randolph (?-I think that's his last name) who brought a realistic acedemia feel to the Professor and brilliance to The Life of David Gale.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away, seriously just go rent it, buy it, or whatever, just see it. You won't be disappointed.
0441009425|4.0|As humans finally reach to the stars in the 23rd century, they find more puzzling enigmas than answers as to why they seem to be alone. At first there seems to be no sign of other intelligent life, but the ruins of technological civilizations on the brink of space flight are discovered and studied.<br /><br />As Dan Sylveste, an archaeologist, struggles against time on Resurgam - the planet of the Amarantin who were wiped out nearly one million years ago on the verge of their spacefaring age by an external force - to discover the origin of the planet's fate and what it means for the future of humankind, a lighthugger interstellar ship is on its way from the Yellowstone system to find Sylveste. Its crew of cyborg Ultras wants him as he may hold the key to curing their captain who has been infected by the Melding Plague - a plague that uses nanotechnology for its own grotesque artist purposes. Also onboard is Ana Khouri who the Ultras kidnapped to be the new gunner for a cache of mysterious, semi-sentient weapons of awesome power and an unknown origin; unbeknownst to the Ultra crew, Khouri is an assassin who maneuvered her way into this position as she has been assigned to kill Sylveste.<br /><br />Reynolds masterly assembles a cast of characters across interstellar space and the extended timeframes involved in travel between the stars and brings them together for the climax. Along the way we learn, we learn of the Pattern Jugglers, the Inhibitors, and Revelation Space. This is the first book in a trilogy (not counting the related novel Chasm City) that will ultimately decide the fate humankind and the Milky Way galaxy.<br /><br />>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />A Guide to my Book Rating System:<br /><br />1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.<br />2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.<br />3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.<br />4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.<br />5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way.
B000000OAN|5.0|Phenomenal! This is an incredible rock album by any musical standards. While the excellent hit \\"Bhohemian Rhapsody\\" is great, it is not even close to the best song on the album.  <br /> <br />It is \\"The Prophet Song\\", which may be the best song ever written by ANY BAND EVER!!! This hard rockin' epic is a true masterpiece with fantastic lyrics. You should hear this loud on the headphones for maximum impact. You'll be blown away!! This is Queen's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"!! INCREDIBLE!!! <br /> <br />The songs \\"Death on Two Legs\\", \\"39\\" and \\"Love of My Life\\" are  also FANTASTIC along with the great hit \\"My Best Friend\\". Every other song is very good. Queen displays their incredible diversity and talent on this album which is a MUST BUY!! Again, \\"The Prophet Song\\" is a epic rock masterpiece that is a hidden jewel. <br />
B00005JKEZ|5.0|very pleased with the quality of the film as well as the extras.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite, I think, is one of those movies you either get, or you don't.  Getting or not getting it has more to do, I think, with where you come from and your own life experiences than any measurement on the \\"hipness scale.\\"<br /><br />Some people will laugh because they think the characters are pathetic and stupid and, well...it's fun to laugh at people so we can feel better about ourselves, isn't it?  For people like that, it is probably important to pay attention to Don, the \\"cool\\" guy at Preston High who laughs increduously at Napoleon and his friends...but who is also unaware that he's the most pathetic character in the film.<br /><br />Anyway, I think the genius of this movie is partly in its deadly accurate portrayal of small-town American life for teenagers.  I grew up in rural Maine (another potato farming state) and I identified very strongly with many of the seemingly absurd situations in the movie...the wacky characters are not so wacky, really.  The way some shots are set up say so much about what a struggle it can be to fit in in a place where the both minds and cliques are pretty closed.<br /><br />Most of the movie's charm is in its examination of the power of true friendship.  Anyone who doesn't think there is a deeper meaning to this somewhat pointless, plotless, random collection of bizarre situations doesn't understand what it means to be willing to do anything for people you care about.<br /><br />In the end, this is a highly original movie(with a very good soundtrack)that will be enjoyed by the Dons of the world who like to laugh at the geeks (unfortunately) and enjoyed more by those who can see pieces of their own humanity in Napoleon and his family and friends.
B000BRBA8S|3.0|Visually very stylish and good music, but where is storytelling?  Am I just too blind to read it?
B000000WJZ|5.0|this album is one of my all time favourites. first time I listened to that was like 10-11 years ago and still I get thrilled whenever I listen to... if you like smashing pumpkins and by any chance haven't listen to that album, that is a MUST!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|man whoever said you can't dance to rock hasn't listened to this band. they're just great. i forgot how good their debut album was. now their second album hasn't brought a sophomore slump but it's in no way as creative or well balanced as the first. right from the start with jacqueline this album gives off nothing but brilliance. I can't say enough about these guys and how underrated they are. They get a bad rep simply because of their invasion of the american airwaves when take me out came out. though that's a great song and gives a good example of the type of progressions a lot of their songs take, franz has so much more to offer. buy this album. do it now
B00007JVBI|5.0|Own it. Now. By far my favorite Cat Power album.
B000E1155E|5.0|these guys are pretty damn good. very solid album. i like this new wave of brit rock that's coming out with the kaiser chiefs franz ferdinand and arctic monkeys. i wish the US had promising bands on the horizon. the last good bands to come out of the US are the white stripes and system of a down and both are going into the second half of their carreers. i envy the british music scene right now. why do we have to be stuck with bands like mcr, green day, and hawthorne height?
0684824906|5.0|One of the best biographies I have ever read.  Though not a very spiritual person, I truly believe that Abraham Lincoln was put here for a reason.  Ms. Goodwin brings him to life more than anyone else I have read....even Mr. Donald.  I read his book and it came and went.  Ms. Goodwin's will never leave me.  He is what a president should be.  He was a one in a million kind of person.  Her book is genius.  He is unforgettable.
0790733226|4.0|On the surface it is just another sci-fi about the possible existence of extraterrestrial life, but on a deeper level it raises a lot of interesting questions. Can an experience that a persons has prove the existence of something even if nobody else shares that experience? This movie, ironically, in contrast to Carl Sagan, seems to make an argument for the existence of God, in that some people seem to have experiences of God that are as real to them as this contact was.
B000002HHB|5.0|This cd should be in your collection....<br /><br />a masterpiece
B000A59PMO|5.0|I caught a couple of episodes of Veronica Mars 2 on UPN and was interested but watched them kind of spaced out and got confused b/c of all of the back story woven into each episode.  I bought the Season 1 DVD and was hooked right away.  The writing is so sharp and witty and Kristin Bell and the rest of the cast do an amazing job translating it.  I was a huge fan of Buffy and I find many parallels in both shows, not least of which are the strong female leads.  I think the best thing about buying the DVD was being able to see the huge season mystery in a continuous arc.  I highly recommend this DVD.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Perhaps it's the glory involved with releasing a double disc set. But, sometimes, no...most of the time - less is more. I think this is the case, because there isn't any changes in theme come the second disc- more of a continuation of uncertain love songs. That having been said- the first 9 tracks are solid, with a great part in each of them, which is rare- I wouldn't be quick to dismiss any of them- often with the hook coming later than sooner. Namely- Meadowlake Street, the best track on the album. Let it Ride, If I Am A Stranger, Dance All Night, Life is Beautiful, Friends, and Tonight keep the consistency of great melodies. Overall, this isn't a overt rock album- people like the alternative country tag- fairly accurate. I really like the album- it's more lay-back and that produces a genuine delight.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I bought this for my neice and her sons. I had a tough time letting it go because I ended up watching it and loved it so much.  I couldn't part with it so I bought her another copy! Egads. This is good for kids and big kids(like way). Really genius stuff.
006056251X|4.0|This romantic pairing -- the shy wallflower and the irredeemable rake -- is traditional in historical romance, but Kleypas manages to make it fresh and have her characters stand out from the crowd.  Evie's home life is so horrid that one can understand why she'd approach Sebastian with her proposition (and one can even understand, if not condone, why her family might treat her that way).  Sebastian has more of a transformation over the course of the novel than does Evie, but it seems a reasonable one, as his restless energy finds an outlet and a focus.  With only one book in Kleypas' \\"Wallflower\\" series left to go, I'm eager to see what happens next.
B000002J2F|5.0|1979 was a difficult year for all so-called prog rock bands. 'Prog' became a dirty word (think of Dave Marsh or Robert Christgau still) - and critics rallied behind the political 'correctness' of punk and...uhm...disco. <br /> <br />Duke was renounced by Genesis' own hardcore fans as a confirmation of 'selling out', already hinted by its previous release, And Then There Were Three (1978), which signalled a peculiar stagnation within the band, overtly attempting to write short concise songs made worse by the overall production that lacked a certain punch and edge.  <br /> <br />Duke is evidently a pooling of harmonic and arrangement ideas developed throughout the interim solo hiatus of Tony Banks (A Curious Feeling) and Rutherford (Smallcreep's Day) after Genesis completed their 1978 world tour. Collins, after sorting out - and eventually breaking up - his marriage,  returned from Vancouver a changed man - and with a new songwriting arsenal inspired by his personal turmoil...and inside his baggage - the notorious Roland CR78 Rhythm Machine. <br /> <br />Duke was in a way a return to form in a different format. Recorded by David Hentschel at ABBA's Polar Studios in Stockholm, the production of Duke pointed towards a more 'live' feel - a perfect approach to focus on Collins' more groovier jazz-rock rhythms developed during his stints with Brand X. Duke's only setback is the rather uneven mood of the song list - majestic suites and passionate instrumentals just don't mix too well with overtly quiet ballads - and neither did the band's decision to split and disperse the originally intended Duke suite (Behind The Lines - Duchess - Turn It On again - Duke's Travels - Duke's End) help much. <br /> <br />Many observers have pointed to Duke as the band's first blatant change of direction into pop. While this holds true when one analyzes the songwriting (e.g. Misunderstanding, Behind the Lines, Turn It On again, Please Don't Ask, Alone Tonight) - many tend to overlook that theexecution of arrangements and playing on Duke (as well as its harmonic complexities) sits closer with the 1976-78 Genesis period compared to the following Abacab-Mama period. Many may find the execution being actually very dense (the Duke suite, Man of Our Times, Cul-De-Sac) - something that would be totally abandoned on it's subsequent 1981 release Abacab.  <br /> <br />So in a way, Duke is a critical transition album that may offer much to both old guard and post-1981 Genesis fans - and a perfect introduction to those showing an initial interest in the band - akin to a strategically placed road sign offering all the clues and directions to the entire musical output of the band. Choose prog or (good) pop.
B000BYA5G4|2.0|The first few scenes from this film were very interesting and will make you want to keep watching, but you will be quickly dissapointed with a predictable and unoriginal story that is full of plot holes. Mediocre at best. Much better films in the same vein are \\"Goodfellas\\" and \\"Blow\\" with Johnny Depp. Nicolas Cage was much better in \\"Matchstick Men\\".
0307120007|2.0|This is a really charming book.  You can read the editorial reviews and other reader reviews for a plot precis.  But, while the text is pitched at 18-24 months, and is full of much more interesting things to do than \\"lift the flap\\", the physical construction of the book is too fragile for little hands.  So unless you have a very well-behaved, gentle little boo, this book will get torn to shreds in five minutes.  I recommend more traditional, hardy, lift the flap books instead.
020530902X|5.0|Strunk & White's 105 page  \\"Elements of Style\\" deserves to sit on your desk right next to your computer. Strunk laid down the bedrock almost 100 years ago, and E.B. White - one of the 20th Century masters of clear writing gently overhauled the work to bring it up to date. In 2006 it still stands as a beacon of clear, concise guidance.<br /><br />What distinguishes this book (compared to the somewhat frantic \\"Eats Shoots & Leaves\\" by Lynn Truss) is that it offers a philosophy that steers us towards clarity above all else. Adopt this as a writing attitude and all else tends to fall into place. You might consider a companion book if your writing is specialized.<br /><br />- If you are writing detailed technical or academic texts, then the more comprehensive \\"Chicago Manual of Style\\" is recommended for you.<br /><br />- If you are writing fiction, then I would add Stephen King's wonderful rumination: \\"On Writing\\" as another companion volume to Strunk & White.<br /><br />This volume is a classic for a reason. It gives us principles, not just rules, and it does so with utmost clarity. It leads by example. With these guys by your side, writing can be enjoyable.

0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult has made a career of writing novels that tackle the human and moral implications of contemporary issues. Here she takes on a family afflicted by their middle child's leukemia. After 2 year old Katie is diagnosed, her parents vow to do anything to keep her alive. They concieve, Anna, a third child who will serve as a donor for Katie, since their other child, Jesse, is not a genetic match and cannot be a donor. 13 years later Anna is strugging with the fact that her existance is due to her sister's illness. With Katie going through kidney failure, Anna faces another invasive procedure. In desperation she sues her parents for medical emancipation.     I felt Katie's supportivess of her sister in this is remarkable. The book highlights that Anna does not act as she does maliciously: she loves her sister deeply. But she feels that her parents cannot keep her medical intersts at heart when they are so concerned with Katie. The family is remarkable in it's love for each other, and the theme of sisterhood versus motherhood yields some interesting thoughts. The parents  obviously love Anna but they can't mentally seperate her from Katie. They go from emergency to emergency always waiting for the other shoe to drop with Katie's health.     And now for the oh so controversal ending. I thought it was perfect. Obviously there was no way for this story to have a happily ever after. The novel prepares the reader for Katie's death: she's been slowly dying throughout her life. But in life things happen that you don't expect. Just like her family didn't expect Katie's cancer, life is thrown at us from left field.  We can prepare for something for years but there are no guarentees that things will go the way we expect. Because the family has been preparing for the eventuality of Katie's death, the treasure every moment with her, to the extent of ignoring other members. Without giving anything away I can safely  say that every family member will regret doing that for the rest of their lives. If there is a \\"moral\\" to the story (I think there are several- after all it's purpose is to explore moral issues) it is to appriciate the here and now: who knows what the future wil bring?
B00011F5DK|5.0|Not your typical game.  It really takes some thinking and strategy.  Fun for the whole family.
0553801503|3.0|As others have noted, this is a step back from the first three in the series. Most of the characters this book focused upon are awash in a sea of vapidity. The story would have been more enjoyable if several of these characters had ridden to oblivion (eg, the wrong female was pushed and made to \\"fly\\"). Thankfully, Brienne and Arya are still around to give the book some depth and excitement. I hope Mr Martin returns to what made the first three such an enjoyable read: urgency.
0060005696|4.0|This book paints just one example of how our thoughts and our behavior on the same subjects differ greatly.  We all think we like the massive number of choices, and we want to go to the shop with the greatest selection and most flexibility.      However, Schwartz gives us evidence, through impeccable research, how the act of choosing between a large number of goods can lead us to be unsatisfied with our ultimate choice and regretful of our decisions.    The only reason that I don't give this a five star review is because his suggestions on how to reduce dissatisfaction when it comes to choosing are un-implamentable.  And given his clear research oriented critical thinking skills, Schwartz should have known better.
0736063684|4.0|I recently bought this book at Borders, because I planned to write my own routine, so as to cater to my own needs. I wished to use this book as a reference. I think the pictures in the book are excellent, and the exercise instructions/descriptions are concise. A very very good reference book so far... until I found something very annoying. <br /> <br />Each of the exercises are color-coded. Different color-codes refers to different muscle groups being worked by the exercise. The back flap of the book shows the full color codings to each muscle groups. However, for the chest section, the color contradicts to what is shown on the picture of the exercises. The pectorals area is supposed to be coded Reddish-orange (from back-flap). However, if you refer to the chest exercises, they coded it with dark brown (and the dark brown is supposed to refer to the Thigh Flexor). The dumbbell flyes is supposed to work the pectorals & front shoulders , but it is coded dark blue ONLY (refers to the triceps, yes, I know the fly does work the triceps a little. But, doesn't it work ,mostly, the pectorals?) The incline dumbbell chest press is coded ONLY to work the pectorals(reddish-orange- but then that color is for shoulders!). Furthermore, shouldn't the incline dmbell chest press work the triceps too?.  <br /> <br />Those are just few of the flaws I care to point out. There are many many more if you look through it carefully. Especially the 'Chest' section. Totally flawed.  <br /> <br />I don't know about you, but for me, considering that this is supposed to be a reference book, failing to correctly point out the related muscle trained, is simply unacceptable. It really annoyed me. The publisher should thoroughly revise it and, oh gosh, pleaseeee calibrate the damn printer to show the right color! Hey, considering that this book is in its new 2006 second edition, It just annoys me more!  <br /> <br />But, overall it is a great reference book for how your muscles respond to different stressors, but, if you're rather paranoid on those little flaws I mentioned above, I'd suggest you wait for the next edition (if there is going to be any). If not, go ahead and buy.  <br /> <br />Hope this has been helpful.
B0001XALTG|5.0|I bought this film last year and I have watched it so many times that I'm going to have to get a new copy. I loved everything about this film. The cast has this amazing chemistry and each actor really becomes their character. The story is so much more than hopeless drug addicts. It tells the stories of friends lost in time, so stuck in their comfort zone that venturing out of it causes complete chaos. This group is trying so desparately to hold on to what was, but eventually time has to catch up and force them to either change or die trying to resist. Everything in this movie stands out: the pain, the misery, the happiness, the comedy, the confusion, fear etc. The opening lines are classic: \\"I chose not to choose life...I chose something different.\\" The other thing about this film is the use of music to shift time. There's none of those subtitles saying \\"three years later\\" or \\"1979\\". What the film uses instead is a brilliant soundtrack in which each track helps shift the movie to new year or a new decade. I have yet to read the book, but if books are better than films that I'm sure to be impressed. This film is not just a must see, its a must own and must see over and over again.
0446310786|1.0|Picked up this book from the library due to the reviews, plus heard from the coversation between 2 colleagues that it is a page-turner. <br />However, it is to my disappointment from page 1 till page 40. I could not drag myself to wade through page 40. It seems like a book  with no clear objective to convey, it might have one, it failed to grap my attention. The first 40 pages talked about childhood memories of 3 kids, again without even any indication to the main story of whatsoever. <br />It might be the greatest literature book as it claimed, it is just not my kind of book.

0143036556|4.0|Some readers of \\"Collapse\\" can be tempted to dismiss Jared Diamond's new book as a recollection of the fall of obscure, outlier human communities throughout history that are considered irrelevant to the management of today's environment.  This assessment is clearly a misrepresentation of \\"Collapse.\\"  After examining large and small ancient human communities such as the Mayas and tiny Easter Island, Diamond takes an in-depth look at contemporary human communities such as Communist China, Hispaniola, and Rwanda.  Diamond does a great job at looking at the economic, social, and political impacts of some disastrous environmental policies, which can become a drag on the long-term competitiveness of a country in an increasingly global world.  Diamond is a cautious optimist who rightly acknowledges the seriousness of some environmental issues that need to be addressed.  Diamond concludes \\"Collapse\\" by reviewing and rebutting the most important reasons that are commonly advanced to dismiss the importance of environmental problems.  More and more smart companies such as General Electric (GE) and British Petroleum (BP) understand that money can also be made from helping to solve some environmental problems.  To summarize, \\"Collapse\\" clearly does not target readers who have a short attention span, do not acknowledge the importance of the past to peruse the future, lack persistence, or are interested in simplistic answers to complex issues.  Diamond could eventually release a DVD similar to the one he made for \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" to broaden his audience.
0805076476|5.0|I don't even know why I bother writing a review for this book.  Especially since it has already been polished to a shine with the praise from professional critics, amateur critics, and \\"word of mouth\\" readers.  Simply put, I'm writing this review because this book is an inspiration and has easily breached my top 10 favorites. <br /> <br />One of those \\"you have to read it to appreciate it\\" style of books in which Palahniuk delivers a unique story told through a unique prose.  I picked it up, and didn't put it down until I had read the final word on the last page.  Its so short yet, so full of philosophical and rebellious sentiment.  No wonder this has become a cult classic.  Read this book!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Keeps Jane Austin's dialogue and most of the plot. Beautiful to watch and listen to.
0780622553|4.0|3.5 stars.  A strong pre-Matrix film of everything not quite being what it seems.  Rufus Sewell give a decent performance of man trying to figure out where he belongs and questioning why things are the way they seem.  A good antihero who is given the opportunity of a lifetime.  For the me, the strongest thing this film has going for it is it unique setting.  The creatures of Dark City were one of the first to combine old (1940-ish) with the new (future-looking setting) to come out with some thing their own.  Later the same technique is used in such films as The Shadow and Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow.<br /><br />For the most part, the script is strong-again for its time-there are few painful lines.  Plus Keifer Sutherland just looks like he having the time of his life in his role.  Overall, it's a decent movie for a lazy sunday afternoon.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is without a doubt the best film I have ever seen. I am what you would call an ardent film buff owning many DVD titles that I'm proud of, so I consider myself a lttle perceptive when it comes to films. When a movie can make you feel an overabundance of emotions it's doing it's job.<br /><br /> Brokeback Mountain is about 2 men coming to terms with their sexuality in the early '60's when they meet while herding sheep on a ranch. Their time together also makes them realize their fondness for one another and thus a love affair is born. To me  the greatest love story ever told begins at this point.<br /><br /> With beautiful scenery ( the film was shot near Calgary, Alberta, Canada), an excellent script, superb directing by Ang Lee, and wonderful performances especially by Heath Ledger who puts on the greatest performance by an actor I have ever seen, Brokeback Mountain has everything a film should have.<br /><br /> It's been many years since a film from Hollywood has explored the sensitive subject of homosexuality. The last film that I saw that was superb in dealing with this was \\"Making Love\\", and what I like about \\"Brokeback\\" is that gay men are depicted as normal average Americain men. Also, during the 2 hours no one is going to die from AIDS, no one want's a sex change, and the gay leads are not having sex with an overabundance of guys.<br /><br /> Thank you Ang Lee and the other's associated with the making of this film and most of all Heath Ledger; you have made Ennis Del Mar my hero. For the very first time in my life I am proud to be a gay man after viewing your performance.
B000B0WODA|1.0|I love FF and was excited to listen to this CD. The format of it is a Dual Disc CD/DVD therefore it is thicker and will not fit in some players. There is a *very* small warning about this on the back and is something most people won't notice, I know I didn't. I listen to all my CDs on my ipod now, so I tried to load this CD into my laptop. It didn't seem to fit so I gave it a little push (I know, stupid) thinking it would still work. Well, it got stuck, wouldn't play and wouldn't eject. I finally managed to remove it with a pair of tweezers and now it is all scratched up and most likely useless. Should have just gotten it from itunes.

0060589280|5.0|i found this novel readable and entertaining - and more. the presentation of sex as mechanical or instrumental, then sex as intense (s&m), then sex as mutual (tantric) was   convincing. in fact i found in the last part of this book the most compelling depiction of the synergy of sex and love that i've ever read. enlightening.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|My eight-year-old really liked this film.  It is cute and funny.  Amazing how clunky the computers in the movie look today!
B00000295A|5.0|I own all of Jamiroquai's cd's and i think most of them are great. This is absolutely my favorite to listen to straight through. I think the horns are amazing especially on \\"Hooked Up\\", and the percussion always ends up pushing the pace in a subtle way. This album just makes me move and I think JK and co. have so much raw energy. Stuart on Bass is sick sick sick straight through. \\"Revolution 1993\\" has become my favorite song by Jamiroquai -- love the lyrics, the message, the excitement, the tension/release, its just put together so well. \\"Music of the Mind\\" is a great instrumental track and shows off the jazz-rock-funk roots of what became the later disco-enhanced Jamiroquai. Sweet solos too, the keys are great. Also love \\"Too Young To Die\\" and \\"Emergency On Planet Earth\\". Impressive debut from a band, and it stands as one of my favorite discs.

B00007AJF8|4.0|This is a seriously weird movie.  The frustrated puppeteer, Craig, prostitutes himself by becoming a file clerk at a soulless office on floor 7 1/2.  It's straight out of Dilbert.  The weird things Craig finds there seem to me to point up the bizarre things we do in our real offices every day.  (I work in a windowless office myself, where hardly a day goes by without management coming up with some new way of making my job harder.)  The movie only gets stranger from there.  For no apparent reason, Craig falls in love with his heartless co-worker Maxine, a woman whose most striking trait is a willingness to do anything for money. Craig's wife Lotte falls for Maxine as well, and they carry on a love affair by taking trips through the head of John Malkovich.  All the characters in the film are completely off their rockers.The send-up of our society's obsession with celebrities is hilarious.<br /><br />The fact is, in the U.S. today we are living in a society that has gone completely bonkers.  The standard of living in America has declined an amazing amount in the last few decades, yet we still hear lots of rosy figures about economic growth.  We line up to apply for 30 years of debt slavery in exchange for a suburban Colonial with a two-car garage, then drive an hour and a half each way to get there every day.  We sell off our planetary birthright for a cheap toaster from Wal-mart.  Our politicians fall over each other to spend money the country doesn't have for a war we don't need.  Even after New Orleans, people seem to believe that global warming isn't a big deal.  The fact is, the party that cheap oil brought us is coming to an end.  If you think life in the U.S. is crazy now, wait and see what it will be like in ten years when the population has grown by another few million and the resources are running out.  (For more on this, see Kunstler's book \\"The Long Emergency.\\")<br /><br />When I look at America today, I think of the movie Being John Malkovich.  We have invested our country's lifeblood in a suburban lifestyle with no future.  Are we going to wake up, or are we just going to keep on going down this road to nowhere?e have invested our country's lifeblood in a suburban lifestyle with no future.  Are we going to wake up, or are we just going to keep on going down this road to nowhere?
0060899190|5.0|This book is sensational, I always check out the website and for someone to come up with something like this is amazing.  The author has helped people in more ways than anyone could possibly understand, everyday people can relate to each other & realise that they're not alone in the world and that life is really worth living and changes can be made to enjoy it, even without the help of someone near by.  I recommend it to anyone & everyone.
B00005JOFO|2.0|I read all the gay press about this movie and knew that some points would be exaggerated.  So be it.  Then I read all the straight press about this movie and knew that some points would be homophobic and misunderstood.  Then I read the story and thought, okay.  I went to see the movie.  And I kept hitting the button on my Timex Indiglo to see if two hours had about passed yet.  Then I yawned.  Then I almost fell asleep.  Then I kept wondering what the big deal was about this movie.  For all the hype, NO BIG DEAL.  Did it make me think?  No.  About what?  About gay cowboys who may or may not look as yummy as Jake and Heath?  About sheep jokes on the range?  About queers and steers?  Uh, no.  No, no and no.  The big secret sex scene was forgettable and took up maybe ten minutes of the movie.  I wanted to slap Ennis's wife for being so tolerant and stupid for all the years she put up with his infidelities.  And gay or straight, cheating is cheating.  I wonder if she would've been so tight-lipped about his affair if the other man had been a woman.  Hmmm.  Just something to think about.  This is not a movie about unsung gay love.  It's a movie about cheating on your spouse, regardless of the time period it's placed in.  There were a lot of gay figures in history who found a way to be together with the one they loved without hurting a third person.  Did this movie make me cry?  No.  Not even a sniffle.  Did I like anything about this movie?  Yes, the scenery is breaktaking, wherever it was filmed.  Someone told me Northern Canada.  I'm not sure.  And this is why I give it 2 stars.  If it had been filmed in NYC, I would've given it 1 star.  I wish I knew how to quit falling for tripe like this.  (You knew that was coming.)  Save your money and rent the recently re-released on DVD movie from the seventies called \\"Making Love.\\"  It's much better.  And more believable.

0312199066|5.0|If you think the lunar landings were a hollywood extravaganza, then this book is science fiction. However, if you listen to the author, who makes a very detailed, compelling narrative about the attempt to land on the moon, you will realize this is not science fiction. <br /> <br />However, it contains all the great elements of science fiction: personalities crashing, people sacrificing everything in the name of exploration (or ego?), a mad german scientist behind it all, stupid mistakes killing participants, and a number of insanely huge explosions. <br /> <br />If you don't want any plot giveaways, don't read on. <br /> <br /> <br />Gene makes a hilarious account of his space missions, covering his early youth, his early navy flying off of carriers, and then the space program itself. If you enjoy science fiction, I really think you will love this book. It feels like a heinlein novel- except it is the real people behind the scenes, dreaming big dreams. Just getting a feeling for the excitement vicariously of those early days of the space program. He keeps the writing on a very human level- he is just a guy being shot into space, and knows a lot of technical details, but does not get bogged down in them. <br /> <br />Personally, I have always felt the early NASA pilot program was a bit like a eugenics program (even before the movie Gattica). It stank of racism, the self misrepresentation associated with machismo, and of fascist nationalism. And truth be told, all of these are subtexts of the book- if you show any hint of concern about your own self performance- you are yanked from the program immediately. All of the guys are of one race, and one of the main drives of the program is not achievement, but of a political race with the USSR. <br /> <br />However, it is an excellent book, and it truly demonstrates just how fast the technology progressed and how untested it was. The astronauts at numerous times struggled with the just developed technology- unable to get many things to work on many missions, they would gloss over it in the press, and then redesign on the ground to make it work the next time up. Landing on the moon truly was a massive human achievement. <br /> <br />If you reflect on the fact that no human had flown until 1903, then we blasted a human into space in 1961- only 58 years had passed! Since 1961 another 45 years have passed. <br /> <br />The author does an amazing job of capturing the excitement of the early missions, and for this reason alone it is a must read book. Landing a human on the moon is a once in a species adventure, and there is no way to participate in the achievement fully without reading some first hand accounts. Even though you know who ends up being on the moon first, you start rooting for the author to make it onto the mission- he was a hair away from being the first human there.
1586217194|3.0|I have just finished listening to this book.  I enjoyed it.  I found it very interesting and entertaining.  Do NOT, however, buy this book for educational purposes.  The author tells many stories of how other people are able to use their gift of quick thinking, but gives no instruction on how to enhance this ability in oneself.  But, just to reiterate, it was a very enjoyable book.
B000AP04L0|5.0|When I first saw Office Space, I hated this movie. I didn't find it funny, and even though my friends jokingly referred to it as where we would be in 10 years (we were all computer engineering majors), I just hated it. The movie has since grown on me, and I think it's one of the best comedies out there. <br /> <br />I think what really gives Office Space's it's sheer staying power is that every character is twisted. This is not your normal story with fully fleshed out, dynamic characters who seamlessly fit together. Oh, no. This is stereotypes at their best and brightest. If you've ever worked anywhere with more than 5 people, you're going to associate these stereotypes with your current and former co-workers. There's the woman who never varies from her routine, down to saying the same thing the same way EVERY time; the manager that doesn't actually listen, has the annoying facial tick/movement/phrase; the squirrelly looking mumbling guy that no one pays attention to; the stoner chick with no real life plan, and the young obnoxious guy who's sole goal is to get luck. Not every place I've worked has had everyone one of these stereotypes, but I'm sure I can place at least a couple of them at any job I've ever had. <br /> <br />It took me a few viewings to really realize that the movie has two equally entertaining plotlines. The first is Peter, who hates his job, has a girlfriend who's cheating on him, and is always suckered into working on the weekends. We see the movie through his eyes, which has it's ups and downs, including hypnosis, slacking off work, and the new girlfriend that flips off her boss. However, the equally funny, and almost non-sequitor counter story is of Milton, office drone that's stepped on, ignored, made fun of, and worst of all, has his beloved red Swingline stapler stolen. He says so many funny things that it's worth watching the movie a couple times to really get what he's saying. And if you own the More Flair copy, it gets better. <br /> <br/>This copy was a Christmas present from the same person who gave me a red stapler for my birthday last year. While it's not loaded full of hours upon hours of special features, I did enjoy the making of featurette, where they interview the cast.  You get a wider, more in-depth view of all the characters. My favorite sheds new light on Milton's line and I could see the squirrels, and they were married,\\" which is apparently a euphemism for what he actually saw the squirrels doing.  I know it's a funny thing to really gain appreciation for, but it's the bits like that line that make Office Space one of the comedy gems. <br /> <br />Not everyone is going to like this movie. If you're one of those people who saw it once and thought it was stupid, humorless, or pointless, watch it again. You might it's not as bad as you thought it was.

0393327655|4.0|Harris's \\"The End of Faith\\" is an interesting, lively read. I agree with nearly all of what he says, but I am left disagreeing with his conclusions. There is something at the core of this book that is too narrow, and too certain. Harris's arguments against literal, faith-based interpretations of scripture are intellectually unassailable, yet they show a certain unwillingness to play the human game.     It is easy to point to the Garden of Eden and note that it features a talking snake, which is biologically improbable. It is more difficult, and more rewarding, to ask what the story is getting at. One might ask WHY people have such powerful responses to these narratives that they are willing to affirm them, even when they contradict reason and evidence, even at the cost of their lives.     A poem is not diminished when it is translated into literal language; it is killed altogether. Religious parable, too, cannot be articulated in rational form without dying. Harris argues that the time has come for us to kill religious parable, because its particular expression of unreason is leading us to the brink of calamity. What he does not acknowledges in this book is the baby being thrown out with the bath water.     Some arguments are irrational, but some are non-rational. Symbolic forms are non-rational because they are non-propositional. To treat symbolic forms as 'error' is to miss the point. The fact that religious thinkers often confuse symbolic forms of expression with literal statements is hardly the fault of the literature. Those persons will not be made more rational by the rejection of religious narrative.     Is religious material the cause of the kind of uncritical reflection that poses a grave threat to our world, or a SYMPTOM of uncritical thinking? Would G. W. Bush make a better philosopher than theologian?    Many reviewers have pointed out that it is not religious material per se that is the problem, evidencing disasters such as Maoist China, Soviet Russia,and Nazi Germany. Harris's reply is unconvincing. He argues that this is consistent with his analysis, because the true target of his book is dogma, not religion.     Harris cannot have it both ways. One need only leaf through the book to see that he is plainly NOT attacking dogma, he is attacking religion. His argument conveys a sense of vendetta that undermines its persuasiveness through its single-mindedness. His appeal to Buddhism as a possible form of rational exploration of religious issues does not convince us otherwise, because his version of Buddhism is so decontextualized from its own religious, narrative base that it is no longer recognizable.     Two pages of footnote caveats will not persuade any reasonable reader of this book that Harris does not think the problem is religion. He has not effectively made the case that the problem is religion per se, and he has not convincingly come to terms with the unique qualitites of religious narrative. Nor has he accounted for the ubiquity of religious narrative. Surely if Darwin is correct, then there must be an adaptive significance either to religious thinking, or the types of thought that give rise to religious thinking.     Despite my significant disagreement with Harris's interpretation, this is still a fine and worthwhile book by any standard. He is an eloquent, courageous, and entertaining author with considerable intellectual powers. He makes a case that many would hesitate to argue in today's intellectual climate in the US, and he makes it vigorously and well. This book has challenged me and changed my thinking on a number of important topics.
B000008JUM|2.0|I am going to load this CD on my computer so that I can delete half of the tracks.  Whoever had the bright idea of having someone rap out Cole Porter songs must've been on drugs. Cole Porter songs are known for their polished lyrics.  Having hip-hop artists add what they think of as poetry is a travesty.   <br /> <br />Some of the cuts are excellent.  Sinead O'Connor needs to do more standards.  Annie Lennox can sing anything and I'll love it.  Tom Waits, on the other hand, sounds best singing his own music.  Song samples listed on the Amazon web page give the best segments of the songs, not a representative sample.  So, if you enjoy experimenting, or can afford to buy a whole CD for a few good tracks, get this CD.  If you want an album of Porter's standards this is not for you.
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|This is a breath of fresh air.  Sometimes, by the time Christmas rolls around the 24/7 Christmas music has gotten stale.  This album offers a refreshing break from the ordinary.

B000002G23|5.0|I absolutely enjoy a whole lot of great Rock tracks and performers from the 70's and 80's. While so many acts try to deliver today, like Britney Spears, Usher and Beyonce', there just isn't that feeling of influence you's expect to see from the past. That's been the case with Sting and his era with The Police. The music they've conjured was absolutely amazing, and just delivers to each and every way the trip from England had conjured. Now, all the convience of every Police take, can be showcased in a great box set for all who still want to stand close to Stewart, Andy and Sting.<br /><br />Message In A Box: The Complete Recordings, is a four disc set that delievrs everything The Police made out to be successful from the 70's and 80's. The compilation does highlight every studio track nicely, and full of promise. The compilation includes so many great Police classics like the most played radio song to date Every Breath You Take, Don't Stand So Close To Me, the deep and dark Spirits Of The Material World, Can't Stand Losing You and their first chartbuster, Roxanne. The album has does showcase a whole lot, and the music from the group has been restored very nicely in its original sound and feeling.<br /><br />Although many people might feel that Message In A Box might be a waste of money, because Boxed Sets are way too expensive, The Police still are displayed well for die hard fans of Sting, or anybody who still feels the need for every song wrapped around their little finger. I absolutely recommend this collection.<br /><br />Album Cover: A-<br /><br />Songs: A<br /><br />Price: A-<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: A 1/2-
B000005RFQ|5.0|This was my first concert \\"Black Sabbath's Born Again\\", I saw these guys with Quiet Riot. That right, Quiet Riot, ok to the point. Aside from being 14, and never been to a concert, this was one of the best stage performances ever! I have seen all the different versions of Sabbath and Ian was awesome in his own way. The stage was filled with stonehenges and a baby devil at the beginning! Why do you ask is he talking about the concert? Because this is what led to me buying the album which kicks serious ass! I remember my parents trying to throw this away and having teachers sending me to the office because my shirt was not appropriate dress. Please just put all opinions aside and buy this album and realize this is a great album regardless of your love for Dio and Osbourne! They kick ass too, I am just saying Black Sabbath has given us a variety of sounds and style over the years. Rock on Sabbath Fans!!!!!
0679422714|4.0|As a high school history teacher, I always look forward to our annual \\"Who's the most evil of them all?\\" debate.  We try and decide who's the worst among Hitler, Stalin and Mao.  If you go by raw numbers, Mao wins the title, as Jung Chang amply shows in this biography of the Chairman.  You can certainly argue that Mao is the worst mainly because nobody at all was safe from him, not friends, foes or even typical Chinese who never came close to him.  If you were a good Aryan in Germany and kept your tongue bitten, I imagine you had some good times in Nazi Germany.  And good party members (if you weren't purged), probably survived the Soviet Stalin experience.  But Mao------ Bad news for everybody! <br /> <br />This book is first rate at outlining all the events in Mao's career, but I do have one reservation.  The tone.  Chang consistently gives us the facts and then must always editorialize on how bad Mao was just in case we didn't get it.  In her earlier book, Wild Swans, she left the reader free to draw his/her own conclusions from the facts about Mao and I thought this was much preferable.  She's a first rate storyteller and she should let the story tell itself. It seems that she hates Mao so much (and who shouldn't?) that she just writes the whole book in a frenzied hatred.  That's not necessary.  Her facts more than explain how malevolent he was.  Give the reader some credit to \\"get it.\\" <br /> <br />One slight historical error---she cites Nelson Rockefeller as Nixon's Vice President, when he was really Gerald Ford's VP. <br /> <br />But a very interesting page-turner that I breezed through in a week.  Very good quotes throughout and highly recommended.  This is also good to read in tandem with Alan Bullock's great \\"Hitler and Stalin.\\"

B000CSUYFQ|4.0|Having listened to this album first without having heard much about Liars, I didn't know what to expect. This album is certainly not the Gang of Four influenced music that seems popped up on their first album, this is tentative, slow moving music for the most part. It's got an edge to it, an uncertainty that is quite charming. <br />I must say, I wasn't too sure after listening to it once through. However, the last song saved it. \\"The Other Side Of Mt. Heart Attack\\" is, in my eyes, a perfect song. It's mood and implementation just fits so well, with the sighs in the background, the subtle instruments and the unnerving yet sincere lyrics. It's not the most gripping or exciting song ever, but there's something about it that works so well. <br />The album as a whole work less well than this final track, but its a good release nevertheless.

0307276902|3.0|My book group chose to read A Million Little Pieces in light of all the controversy. Knowing that there was some embellishment did make me read every scene through a lens of skepticism.  But overall, I really enjoyed the book.  My younger brother was in and out of rehab throughout his teens until killing himself at nineteen. In reading Frey's memoir, I felt like I was getting a glimpse into my brother's life. A look into what rehab was like for him. To constantly be the family screwup. To feel such hatred toward your parents and not really understand why. It was like reading my brother's journal and for that, I found the book extremely compelling.<br /><br />Likewise, if anyone has dealt with addiction--personally or through a loved one, I think this book will provide some insight into the struggle. No one becomes a raging alcoholic or drug addict by choice. Sometimes looking in from the outside it's hard not to shake the person, and say, \\"Just get it together.\\" Frey shows why that is not such an easy task.<br /><br />I've read the new author's note Frey will be adding to future editions of his memoir and feel satisfied that he has now leveled with his readers. Sadly for him and all the humiliation the controversy has caused, I don't think the embellishments he added to his story would have made much difference to the reader had he left them out.  I found the whole root canal scene so difficult to read--as I hate dental work--that I largely skimmed it anyway.<br /><br />I recommend A Million Little Pieces to those readers who want to know of the struggles of addicts to get clean.  If you're looking for a 100% account of an addict's life and struggles, look elsewhere. But it's worth a read.<br /><br />[...]

0671004107|5.0|I read this book several years ago.  I still think it is the best sci-fi novel I have come across.  Contact is the only novel Carl Sagan ever wrote.  One of the most amusing and powerful plot points in this book was never included in the film version: it involved iterations of pi. <br /> <br />I think that one of the other reviewers here is missing the point when he carps about Carl's atheism.  It's not about God.  We earthlings are way too hidebound by our petty, superstitious and in many ways self-destructive concepts and belief systems of God.  This novel is about intelligence and the triumph of human intelligence as a key to communing with intelligence in the universe. <br /> <br />Drake's equation indicates that there is a high probability of other intelligent life in the universe.  The human species has only been around for a relatively brief time in the chronology of the universe.  Scarcely a blip, actually.  The presumption that we - who have only used our brains for barely 200,000 years, where most of our discovery has taken place in the last 50,000 years, with a concentration of technological achievement in the last 6000 years, where most strides have taken place in the secular societies of the last 200 years - would be superior to other intelligent life is absurd.  LOL!  We'll be lucky if we don't annihilate ourselves before we ever make contact. <br /> <br /> <br />I understand that Carl had some big-time rows with the film studio; I guess it wasn't produced to his satisfaction.  It would be interesting to get the details on that.  Though the film was a powerful drama, the book still blows it away. <br /> <br />Those who like science in their science fiction will be satisfied and entertained by Contact.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I have seen many operas, such as carmen, la boheme, Aida and many others, but no opera can top the phantom of the opera with Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum. The choice of taking Gerard Butler to play the Phantom was absolutely perfect, his bearing, his manliness, his age and certainly his voice. Emmy Rossum was a perfect choice for the role of Christine, sweet, innocent and very beautiful, no wonder that a man who always was so lonely would want her!  Who ever was responsible for choosing these two movie stars, did a perfect job.They could not have chosen anyone better than Gerard and Emmy. I enjoyed this movie so much that I play it over and over again. <br />The music itself, the lyrics, the way this opera was sang, has overwelmed me so much, that I find it hard to describe in words what kind of effect it has had on me. But in short it is one of the best opera ever made, and how can this ever be topped?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The only bad thing about this DVD package is that once you reach the end, there's hardly any hope of their being more to come! Firefly, despite it being a better show than Buffy The Vampire Slayer (Whedon's previous work) never caught on and was cancelled after only a season. The story is based a lot off of the American civil war with the villains holding a strong resemblance to the United States democratic government. Our heroes are a band of goofy space travellers who get by on petty thievery and smuggling (think Han Solo). An interesting twist is that though it is a futuristic sci-fi show, there are no aliens! The comedy, drama and action are wonderful, with of course Whedon's witty, entertaining dialogue in full effect.

It is not only a romance but a life story. It is exciting, inspiring, and fun to read. I couldn't put it down. Zoya faces many problems, but tries her best not to collapse and works to solve them in any way possible. When you fall get up and try again. Zoya is an extraordinary tale of a magnificent woman I highly recommend it.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|I just had to right a review about my favorite movie. When people want to see a Cinderella movie they should watch this one and not the cheap imitations that get released every year. I have watched this movie over 50 times and am not ashamed to say that I have memorized the script. Every time I see it I can't help but shed a tear or more. I know this sounds extreme, but the screen play and actors are marvelous. You understand why the Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Anjelica Huston) hates Danielle De Barbarac (Drew Barrymore), and any woman can't help but fall in love with Prince Henry (Dougray Scott). I won't say more you have to see it to believe how wonderful it is.
B000AP04FG|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.   <br />I usually will see a movie to it's end good or bad,  but this one I just could not sit through.Jolie, in this role, is  not believable in any stretch of the imagination. She just does not come across as   tough enough to fight her way out of a paper bag.  Pitt on the other hand handles the part in his usuall way of handleing this kind of role. The inconsistency in this production was the only thing that made it somewhat laughable. Of course I have to remind myself of the fact that there is a magic formula in Hollywood. All you have to do is put two sexy superstar actors together in the same movie and the rest will take care of itself good or bad. I say no thanks. Nothing to do? Watch paint dry rather than view this movie.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|My close friend had never seen this movie, but it was highly recommended to her, so my friend and I (also with a small group of friends) rented this movie one night. I'd heard of it before, (browsing Jake Gyllenhaal movies) and it seemed interesting but had never pursued it.  <br />After we settled in to watch it, I was completely hooked. It took alot of processing to grasp the plot, but trust me, it was worth all of that thinking! The only downside was that after I viewed this film, for a few nights after, 6 foot tall demonic rabbits began to creep into my peripheral vision.  <br />Jake Gyllenhaal was absolutely stunning in this film, I forgot it was him for most of this movie and he became Donnie Darko- the confused, insane, teenager who wants to get off with pretty much every girl he knows (and then some). His body language, haunting eyes, limp posture, crooked smile, all create Donnie's presence.  <br />I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 12 or so, (I'm 13). It's mainly rated R for <br />violence (not gory though) <br />some drug use (I fail to see the harm in this) <br />sexual references (come on, these are teenagers)  <br />and profanity (and not just the mild ones) <br /> <br />Overall though, it's an excellent movie and I'm dying to see it again.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|This movie had me going for a while. At first I thought that they would base is on the acclaimed capcom resident evil. Thought that they would base it on the frist game in the series. If you really wanna know where it fits in the series, it's sort of like a prequel to the events that unfolded. The mansion in the movie is not the one in the game. It takes place at a different mansion but takes place during the first game. This movie left me shocked most of the time what with the countless surprises and consistant 'have to hurry' flow. It's the perfect begining to kick off the series. The only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is becuase the zombie effects could've been a littl better. But, other than that, that's all. Enjoy!
B0001XLY8S|5.0|OK. Let me begin by saying that I have not read the book which I feel sure  gives me a better ability to review the movie based purely upon conveying its merits without being biased toward the novel. I understand that 99% of the time a movie can't hold a candle stick to the book. Many times the complexities and intracacies do not translate well to the screen, what movies should strive for and are good at doing, however, is conveying the mood and \\"sense\\" of the times. That is what I feel Cold Mountain does very well. Yes, perhaps the story doesn't follow the book and Renee Zellweger, Natalie Portman, and Nicole Kidman are to beautiful for their own good, but they do convey the the feel of the South in the late 1800's even if this is an idealistic tale. The story occurs in period of history when the South is being ripped apart and the graciousness of the people would swiftly be carted off in the succeeding years in favor of more \\"modern\\" principles of individualism instead of commnity and sharing.   Not every Southerner was \\"bad\\"; war hurt everyone as the movie shows, evil knows every race and all sides. On other fronts, the movie's \\"emotional core\\" that was supposedly lacking is completely misjudged by critics. In addition to be idealistic this is a romantic tale, one in which everything does not have to be rational; indeed love is not always rational. Inman is a quiet man -  his feelings are communicated through actions and looks. Is one always compelled to fill up the air with words to innumerate love for another? Many people, especially women, are intuative in this way- just like Ada. In short, I loved this movie, its ebb and flow weave like the poetry of a lost time as Inman meets various characters juxtaposed to each other on his journey home:fallen preachers and kind neighbors; musicians and easy women. Mingehlla leaves us with this poetic sensory overload to work out in our minds many hours after the lights have come up. Yes, it's a blockbuster and all that implies, yet, very occationally, even the blockbusters get it right. It's my firm belief this is one of those times.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|This is the best film of the year. Peter Jackson has outdone himself once again. The special effects are truly amazing, but its Naomi Watts who truly makes this film shine. She is simply beautiful. The story is wonderful and exciting. Everything from the acting to the films score is perfect. This is a film not to be missed. We will perhaps never see a film if this magnitude ever again. Thank You Mr Jackson!!!
0767834739|1.0|I got suckered in, I'll admit it. I kept telling myself that the sequel will be better than the original. But it wasn't. The plot was all over the place and there were just too many predictable moments followed by a useless need to just deliver action without a comprehendable story. It's almost like the filmakers were constantly trying to outdo themselves. Granted, the costumes are very well done, the characters look like the characters, but there are just too many ridiculous searching scenes and dull lines like ' try to shoot em in the head' and the classic ' who the f are you?' It just gets repeatative. What results is a movie that could have been better but failed to even make par. Better luck next time, guys. And if that isn't enough, there's a hint that there might be another sequel. Oh brother is all I have to say. The only thing that saved this movie was the fact that it had a lot of good cinematograpghy and style. Also, the token black guy was hilarious throughout the whole movie. But, trust me on this folks, rent it. Don't buy it.
B000002MU3|5.0|As stated before, Michael Stipe and the boys chucked the mandolin, organ, and string section and made a driven grunge-alt. album. The release of this album has spawned different rxns. Some call it a gutsy move. Others call it trite. I, however, call it a breakout.  <br /> <br />So this album isn't Out Of Time. Get over it. Out of time was really good, yet overproduced and filler ridden. This, al contrario, represents a different side of REM. To avoid making the same album yet again, they stepped out of what may or may not have been expectations of their label, they droned all of the above out with guitar on overdrive. \\"Frequency\\" is one of REM's best songs, \\"Strange Currencies\\" is a happy love song from them for a change, and \\"Bang And Blame\\" is owned by echo-effects. not to mention, \\"let me in\\" is easily the most creative, the most acid-rock recalling REM song to date. I don't think they've ever done anything more creative. So, if you are an REM fan who was disappointed by this album, challenge yourself. Imagine that REM didn't make this, but it was some other band. Your prespective may change. <br />
B000BCKFWK|4.0|It strikes me as funny that the \\"star\\" that this edition of the movie that Amazon.com opts to promote is Jessica Alba.   <br /> <br />Basically, Sin City is an adaptation of Frank Miller's series of graphic novels/comic books, which I haven't read.  What you'll find if you're not a comic/graphic novel geek is a compelling visual experience.  It has the standard Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino level of violence, so be careful.  This is an edgy, engaging journey through a different world.  What Rodriguez/Miller do with color and movement in the movie is really interesting.  The directors end up relying on the Tarantinoesque Pulp Fiction mode of semi-related stories to get through the movie, but the experience seems to me to be more aesthetic than narrative.   <br /> <br />Do the benefits of the \\"Special Edition\\" really add up to the cost?  I don't know.  I could barely tell the extra scenes that were in this addition, but I find that the many bonus features and the multitude of commentary tracks made this edition more worthwhile than the \\"plain jane\\" version.
B0007ORU66|5.0|Contrary to what a previous reviewer said, this cd must have been released on cd format, because i have a copy and am listening to it as I write this. Also, amazon obviously has some used copies. I got mine off allofmp3.com, an online mp3-buying store. So, if you want it, you can probably get it there or right here at amazon. If I'm not mistaken, this one was origionally not too hard to find on LP format, was only released on cd format in Europe. I really can't understand why. Beatles fans, don't overlook this one. It has some of their best and most known songs, not to mention the not-so-radio friendly gem, \\"rain.\\" <br /> <br />
B000E1YVZU|5.0|To say after watching the movie version of \\"Rent\\" that I like the musical more than the movie is a strange comment to make because I have not (yet) seen the award-winning show on stage (ironically, the touring company has been next door in Wisconsin this week, but driving eight hours to see it tonight seems like a big much even to me).  But I know that I like the music more than the characters and fully admit that the fault is in my self more than in Jonathan Larson's creations; I just cannot relate to the people in that time and place the way so many Rentheads have and in my defense will point out I did not relate to the original Bohemians in Puccini's opera either.  I swear that Roger (Adam Pascal) looks like Moebius the Living-Vampire from Marvel comics and I cannot get past that idea.  I should be able to identify with would-be filmmaker Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp), but I like his ability to tango more than his cinematic style.  Mimi (Rosario Dawson) is sexy, but dying, and Joanee (Tracie Thoms) and Maureen (Idina Menzel) cannot wholly commit to the idea that opposites attract.  As for Benjamin (Taye Diggs), the dude is definitely slumming.  The characters that I really care about are Tom (Jesse L. Martin) and Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) because I think they represent the brain and heart of this group of friends, and even when logic dictates that this movie should be rated at 4.5 at best, I think of that final shot in the film of Angel and I have to round up become of its poignancy.  Even with the alternative ending, the smile on Tom's face when Angel walks by and holds his hand for a minute is almost as transcendent.<br /><br />Turning some of the songs into dialogue so it is not wall-to-wall singing was not necessary from my perspective.  I am perfectly willing to listen to musicals or operas that are music and all singing from start to finish, with or without recitatives.  In fact, I think that what is so appealing about the music in \\"Rent\\" are the harmonies, not only of the voices as amply demonstrated by \\"Seasons of Love,\\" but also between the voices and the music.  Ultimately, there is a sense that the emotions matter more than the words.  Is \\"La Boheme\\" any less effective because most of us do not know precisely what they are singing?  After all, one of the most famous arias in the opera is Colline saying goodbye to his coat.  When \\"Life Support,\\" \\"Will I\\" and \\"Another Day\\" combine at the end to make up \\"Finale B,\\" the lyrics are rather simplistic, but the emotional effect is transcendent, even compared to something like the sextet from \\"Lucia di Lammermoor.\\"  In other words, the sound and fury signify a lot in \\"Rent,\\" and if in the end it all comes down to love, then that is not exactly a bad thing.  Plus, with the six voices at the end (eight if you do the alternative version), I think most of us can find a vocal part to sing along with well within our comfort range, not that it stops us from switching parts and trying to be more ambitious.  Larson also provides an impressive range of types of songs, so every couple of songs something in a style you really like comes along.<br /><br />Having been listening to the soundtrack pretty much nonstop since I sent the DVDs back, I have to say that I like it more than the original cast recording.  Of course, six of the original cast are here, so I should point out that not only do I think that those six have brought a decade's worth of experiencing singing these songs to their performances but that the two newbies add something to the mix.  Martin's \\"Santa Fe\\" and reprise of \\"I'll Cover You\\" evidence more depth, and one of the my favorite vocal moments is in \\"Goodbye Love\\" when Dawson and Thoms blend voices and power through, \\"I'd be happy to die for a taste of what Angel had, someone to live for, unafraid to say I love you.\\"  The biggest heresy would be that I like the way \\"Finale B\\" is played straight for the emotional impact of Mimi's revival instead of the mock deusex machina that I hear in the (off) Broadway album.  Again, I realize that those who have seen the musical can hold the exact opposite position and I fully appreciate that seeing the show live, especially songs like \\"Over the Moon,\\" is something different from this film.  Beyond that, producer Rob Cavallo, known for his work with Green Day, did a great job of updating the sound for the 21st century.  As for director Chris Columbus, it taking this particular musical to the streets he did not make it to the sacred heights of \\"West Side Story,\\" but I think \\"Rent\\" works a lot better than the likes of \\"Hair\\" and \\"Godspell.\\"  The bottom line is that my affection for this movie is based more on the ear connected to the heart than the eye linked to the analytical half of my brain, and I will just leave it at that.ck deus ex machina that I hear in the (off) Broadway album.

B000000WA4|5.0|I was a mere 10 years old when this hit the market. It was a stage when I was still extensively listening to country (did I really buy all those Garth Brooks CDs?) So, lucky for me, I missed the grand \\"play out\\" stage of this album. Lucky for me. I bought it in 1998 and became and instant and loyal listener, both to this album and the pumpkins as a whole. Now it's 2005, and if anything, I love it more. In fact, either this or Counting Crows' \\"August And Everything After\\" may be my favorite album of all time. And that says a lot. I listen to anything from the Beatles' \\"Abby Road\\" to Green Day's \\"American Idiot.\\" As a previous reviewer mentioned, this double disc has a lot in common with the Beatles' \\"White Album,\\" not so much as in the way the songs sound, but just how they flow and are arranged. So, w/out further adew, here is the breakdown of the songs:  <br /> <br />DISK ONE: Dawn to dusk  <br />1.Title Track-I might have picked more of a rocker for a beginning, but this is still a beautiful, instrumental piano opening.  <br />2.Tonight, Tonight-Everyone who remembers the 90s remembers this. It's a mainstreem radio-friendly award-winning song that is actually good!  <br />3.Jellybelly-The opening is a little messed up, and it's a typical pumpkins \\"fuzzed out\\" rocker. Not my fav but I listen to it.  <br />4.Zero-big hit for it's time, inspired the \\"zero\\" pumpkins t-shirts. Never cared much for this t-shirt, but this song kicks a**!  <br />5.Here is no why-No idea how they got the title for this. nevertheless, this has always been a favorite. The analogy about \\"sad machines\\" speaks to me, in a way  <br />6.Bullet W/ Butterfly Wings-Classic. Need I say more?  <br />7.To Forgive-Meh. Not the most interesting song on the album, but it's listenable.  <br />8. Ode 2 No-one- or F--- You, as it is sometimes refered to as. The lyrics are a bit cheezy (corgan was obviously pissed as hell about a former love) but fits well as one of the album's heavier rockers.  <br />9.Love-Listen to this song on headphones and you'll feel really tripped out. I think Corgan's idea was to musically recreated this dizzy in-love-for-the-first-time feeling. Always loved this one.  <br />10.Cupid De Locke-Took me a bit to understand this one. It's not really \\"teenager\\" but now that I'm almost 22, I recognize that this is living proof that Pumpkins can be satanic or sweet.  <br />11.Galapagos-BEAUTIFUL more mellow piece about change and nostaligia. Reminds me of my past summers in MI  <br />12.Muzzle-Another hit from the album, I always loved the lyrics to this one. It not too heavy, not too soft. One of my favs.  <br />13.Porcelina of the vast oceans-This should have gotten playtime on the radio, all the way! It's classic. I do wonder how they came up with porcelina, though. Sounds like a toilet.  <br />14.Take Me Down-James Iha-penned slower song to finish off the first half of the show. I usually skip this one. They should just let Corgan write the songs.  <br /> <br />Disk 2:Twilight To Starlight  <br />1.Where Boys Fear To Tread-Complete Hard Rockin' redemption from the first disk's poor closing. The band I used to be in jammed on this song sometimes. Always been a fav.  <br />2.Bodies-Another Fav, same rocking vein as the previous. I remember wondering what was going on between this song and the last. I thought something was wrong with my cd player. How creative!  <br />3.33-Another hit song. Well written, deep, and a good calmer tune after the previous two.  <br />4. In the arms of sleep-If the pumpkins would have made an mtv unplugged (with they should have!), this would have been on it. Great guitar work, and overall, great song.  <br />5.1979-classic hit song and one of my favorite sp songs ever  <br />6.Tales Of A Scorched Earth-can almost feel the heat of it happening too. The pumpkins rip your face off after three slower songs. Rock on!  <br />7.Through The Eyes Of Ruby-This is a really poetic alternative song, followed by a reprise of the titletrack at the end. This is a friend of mine's favorite sp song. It's not mine but it's fab!  <br />8.Stumbeline-I play this on my guitar sometimes. This is prolly the best from Corgan's solo acoustic catalog. \\"Jupiter's Lament,\\" which prolly got bumped by this one, isn't nearly as good.  <br />9.XYU-Jeeze! I would really like to know where Corgan got this title idea AND the lyrics! This giant rocker makes Korn sound like sesame st. music.  <br />10.We Only Come Out @ Night-A song about bats. And who better to write a song about bats than the pumpkins. This is one of the reasons I say that this has similarities with the \\"White Album\\"  <br />11. Beautiful-Title says it. I'll save the wearNtear on my keyboard.  <br />12. Lily, My 1 + Only-This track is genious, and is another potential radio-hit. It's a slower song about a guy who climbs a tree and watches his crush through her window.  <br />13.By Starlight-Straight forward and clean, this could have been from a U2 session. Good sound.  <br />14.Farewell and goodnight-\\"The White Album\\" ended with a track with a similar title. That song is kinda tacky, while this ending is perfection. Nicely done, pumpkins!  <br /> <br />Smashing Pumpkins are one of the 90's best bands, the this album is the reason why. How can u go wrong? <br />
0670033375|1.0|I thought Jared's previous book, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", was outstanding. This book is terrible. His premise that civilizations collapse because they damage the environment is unsubstantiated, and he offers no scientifically valid data to support it. Not worth reading.
B00005B4GU|2.0|Radiohead delivers amnesiac as a follow-up to the much anticipated yet somewhat misunderstood Kid A. From here, it should become clear that leftovers are leftovers for a reason. In Ryan Adam's recent three albums of 2005, his plan was to release all music from one session and make not one album but three. The result. Fillers. Radiohead, however, made a remarkably experimental album in Kid A, and while by no means their best, remains severely underrated. Anesiac is almost the opposite. It was created from unreleased sessions from Kid A, and while a few songs such as \\"I Might Be Wrong,\\" \\"Pact,\\" and \\"Hunting Bears\\" remain true to form, most of these should have remained sessions. Sorry guys, bravo to the max for absolutely everything prior, but I can't really get into this one. I hated Kid A at first, kept retrying until I loved it, but I'm afraid that its just not working with this one. I'll give it an extra star for its three decent songs and for it being made by radiohead. <br /> <br />
B000003CMC|5.0|Released in February 1972, less than four months after Duane Allman's death, EAT A PEACH gathers together the final tracks laid down by the original Allman Brothers Band, the only studio documentation of the short-lived five-man, one-guitar ABB lineup and the remaining performances from the concerts which had yielded the epochal AT FILLMORE EAST album. Far from being a stereotypical posthumous odds and ends collection, however, EAT A PEACH is a treasure trove containing much of the Brothers' best work, and stands right beside FILLMORE at the very apex of their stupendous body of recordings.     Opening with the post-Duane tracks, EAT A PEACH demonstrates from its very first notes that there was - and is - far more to the ABB than one amazing guitarist. Brother Gregg's \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More,\\" though written before Duane's crash, is an effective and all-too-poignant rumination on uprushing mortality with excellent playing from the whole quintet. Dickey Betts, tossed into the unenviable position of sole guitar player in rock's most celebrated two-guitar band, more than holds his own here, contributing top-notch picking on every track - most notably his own thunderstorm instrumental, \\"Les Brers in A Minor,\\" which starts out as a grinding tribute to amplification before morphing into a Santana-esque Latin funk workout liberally spiced with impressive displays of chops all around. \\"Melissa,\\" a beautiful old ballad co-written by Gregg which the Brothers had first recorded with their previous group the Hourglass, is by contrast epitomally delicate and genuinely moving; Dickey's ethereal lead is a dream.     Next up: thirty-three minutes of \\"Mountain Jam,\\" longest of the ABB's many long onstage workouts, the Duane-drenched final third of which is at least the equal of anything on FILLMORE and makes me wonder why that album wasn't simply released as a triple, with this LP-length track included, in the first place. Also recorded during the Fillmore East engagement, \\"One Way Out\\" and \\"Trouble No More,\\" which the Brothers had first tackled on their 1969 debut album, are solid blues jams in the classic Allmans vein.     Finally, there are the last three studio tunes featuring Duane, which with fitting irony point to yet more new directions this band might well have explored had it only had the opportunity. \\"Stand Back,\\" a bouncing number from Gregg, would've been equally at home on IDLEWILD SOUTH; but Dickey's sublime country ballad \\"Blue Sky,\\" with its brilliant solos from both guitarists, and Duane's only ABB composition, the brief dobro/guitar duet \\"Little Martha,\\" mine and master new territory and suggest that a more varied range of material, from an expanded group of songwriters, would have kept this band firmly at the front of the pack through all those gigs that might have been.     More than thirty years later, the original ABB's handful of recordings remain one of the great listening experiences to be had anywhere. EAT A PEACH and AT FILLMORE EAST are the very best of the great, which really leaves nothing to say.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I'm a big fan of Adams, and I think he's a very talented artist. Most people consider this his best. I don't think so, but I do think its good.  <br /> <br />When I first listened to this album, I was quite taken with the first three songs, especially \\"Answering Bell.\\" I thought he was on a roll. If were to compare this to throwing an object off a cliff, this would be where the object soars.  <br /> <br />That being said, the album continues on with \\"La Cienega Just Smiled,\\" \\"Rescue Blues,\\" \\"Somehow Someday,\\" and \\"When the Stars go blue.\\" While not quite as capturing as the first three songs, I love them and listen to them about as much.  <br /> <br />After this point, it become clear that my metaphorical object isn't exactly going to fly. \\"Nobody Girl,\\" SYLVIA PLATH, \\"Enemy Fire,\\" and \\"Gonna Make You Love Me\\" range from the good to the mediocre. \\"Enemy Fire\\" recalls Neil Young's more crazy horse-esque moments, making it my favorite of this batch. SYLVIA PLATH starts out really starts out very strong but seems a bit lackluster towards the end, making it overall a good song. The other two I'm fairly neutral about.  <br /> <br />My flight testing object continues on its downward path, whereby we come to my \\"shady\\" area of the album. \\"Wild Flowers\\" and \\"Harder Now That It's Over\\" are not exactly memorable (i don't remember them very well right now) but I know they're listenable.  <br /> <br />I don't know what Adams was thinking when he layed down the last three tracks. At this point my object crashes into pieces on the rocks below. Better luck next time.  <br /> <br />Overall this another really good album from Adams, but it has flaws. This could have easily been a 10-12 track cd, but instead, it has 16, so the cd kinda drones in places. In other words, the garden is beautiful, it just needs to be weeded. <br />
B00023B1LC|4.0|James Bond take notice.  \\"The Bourne Identity\\" is my new standard for contemporary spy thrillers.<br /><br />I'm not too keen on movies like James Bond and other stuff in this genre, but this one is a lot better. Normally you see the \\"super hero\\" using all kinds of weird gadgets, driving extremely fast sports cars and sleeping with ladies who look more like prostitutes than being normal women.<br /><br />Jason Bourne however doesn't have all this things, which makes this movie a lot more realistic. The fights are fast and very realistic but still entertaining. The action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets, and no incredibly willing women sharing his bed. Our hero even shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competence.  The film is genuinely exciting throughout, which is more than what can be said about many recent action films. Great action-thriller, worth watching for most fans of such. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved in it, and fans of action and thriller.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I've got the original vinyl record that I bought new, and it is censored. This CD is uncensored and is Johnny Cash \\"raw.\\" The individual songs are cut abruptly at the end from the live performance instead of fading. I think it would sound better faded, but otherwise I loved the CD. I give it 5 stars anyway.
0790732203|2.0|Tom Cruise was about to reach super-stardom by 1983 and \\"Risky Business\\" along with \\"Top Gun\\" three years later made him a cinematic icon. Cruise's parents are going out-of-town and the youngster decides that it is time to take his father's porsche out for a spin. Of course disaster strikes and now Cruise needs money and needs it fast. An elaborate plan develops to set up a brothel in his home with the help of sexy prostitute Rebecca De Mornay.  A very entertaining movie...has some dated moments but the music, and performances by Cruise and DeMornay make that a non factor.
0060012358|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The Amazing Maurice\\" and enjoyed every wee last smidgen of it.  I've been a Pratchett fan since \\"Small Gods,\\" which was recommended to me by a bookstore employee (bless him, wherever he is).  Pratchett books take up an inordinate amount of my shelf space, and I'm always keen to snap up the next one; all the same, some are better than others.  (I still can't warm up to the idea of Sam Vimes as a sentimental dad...but that's another story.) \\"Maurice\\" is on a par with \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Equal Rites,\\" and \\"Small Gods,\\" and most like the latter in that the characters are not part of the usual Discworld \\"categories\\" (i.e., the Witches, the Wizards, or the Watch). <br /> <br />Why this novel has been categorized in \\"young adult\\" fiction, I don't know, but it certainly deserved its Carnegie award.  The sentient cat and rats deal with some seriously adult issues as they try to understand their place in the universe and contemplate the fundamental questions of life, death, social order, and whether or not to eat the green wobbly bit.  It's definitely a good read for teens or younger readers, as they deal with these questions themselves, but it's also rewarding for adults who refuse to abandon their imaginations.  There are elements of \\"The Rats of NIMH\\" and \\"Watership Down,\\" but \\"Maurice\\" is definitely its own story. <br /> <br />The characters in this story are wonderfully well-wrought; by the end, Dangerous Beans, Darktan, Hamnpork, Maurice, and others seem like old friends; on the other hand, the Rat King will give you shivers, guaranteed, especially if you go online and check out photos of real rat kings - creepy.  <br /> <br />I give \\"Maurice\\" my highest compliment: I was very sad to see it end, and wish it could have been much, much longer.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|At a point where music is just a marketing search and look for millions of dollars of gainin' points by selling records. This artist is a mold that deserves to be broken, an artist influenced by jazz who sing pop tunes is one of a hell. As I considered all his records are a mixed up into classic songs and new ones who give that special re-inventation to the old dutties. A catchy and flat voice (without high notes or low) that's not so common now on jazz/pop. Kind of Sinatra but still crowd and very special and caughtivatin'voice (I'm messed up I know). <br /> <br />Save The Last Dance For Me it's the ultimate song and Feelin' Good is her back - up song. A beautiful rendition to pop. Unbelievable at any point. As critic pointed his as a wedding singer he's more a bal-room singer or any cabaret singer with calss of course. I'm still itchin' out for Nelly's duo. Nelly Furtado on pop jazz song it's like Madonna singin' Oh Happy Day with the Harlem Choir. No way! but still interesting.  <br /> <br />Still interestin' catchy and aproppiate. Every songs is involved with something that brings you back at 70's. WAY BACK I MEAN IT NICE LISTENING EXPERIENCE Anyway this records is special for those who like the oldies' style. I recomend!!! Don't worry. If you don't like it when you got it, when you have a wed. A Perfect time to put the CD on. Believe it or not!! <br /> <br />
0446525537|5.0|A Walk to Remember is an exquisite story written by an author who is absolutely amazing.  Nicholas Sparks writes from the perspective of Landon Carter, a fifty-seven year old man flashing back to when he was seventeen and met his first true love, Jamie Sullivan.   <br />Landon and Jamie were always in the same classes but never really talked.  Jamie, a Baptist minister's daughter, and Landon is the son of a family rival.  Jamie always carries her Bible with her schoolbooks; she always helps at an orphanage, and takes care of her widowed father.  Landon was always the rebel and the popular kid.  The last person Landon every thought of dating was Jamie Sullivan.  He asks Jamie to the homecoming dance because he is on student council and is required to go to the dance, everyone else already had dates and that is where their story begins.   <br />Landon never thought he would fall in love with someone so different than him, but there is one thing Landon doesn't know about Jamie and that was that she had leukemia and she was dying.  Landon couldn't help but fall in love with Jamie.  They were both seventeen and he asked her to marry him.  Her father approved so they married as soon as possible.  Landon still thinks about his only love and misses her.   <br />Throughout the novel Landon finds himself and realizes what the right things to do are and he falls in love.  He realizes how much he loves Jamie and how amazing she really is.  Like Landon, I fell in love too.  I fell in love with A Walk to Remember and you will too. <br />
B000AAF1U4|4.0|A thought had occured to me after I was watching Atlantis: in many ways, Disney's career is sort of like Metallica's. Now bare with me and I'll explain: Metallica early on developed some really stellar metal music, similar to Disney classics such as Bambi, Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast. Then that fan-imposed slump happened where they produced things that alienated and ticked off many fans(Metallica's Black Album and on records which mirrors Disney films like Home on the Range, Brother Bear and Chicken Little). Granted they're not that great but they still have their charm. Emperor's New Groove is similar to that: it's no classic whatsoever but hey it's enjoyable(I'm one of the few that likes Load/Reload by the way). <br /> <br />Set roughly in the Incan age, Kuzco is an incredibly self-centered emperor. He's not rude or despicable, he just doesn't think of others regardless. That all changes when he fires Yzma, his advisor. Determined for revenge, she creates a plot to kill him, only her sidekick Kronk makes the plan backfire and Kuzco escapes in llama form and ends up with Pacha, a nearby villager. However, it's not a great partnership at first since Kuzco was planning to build a swimming pool/summer house right on Pacha's home. So they have to make it back while avoiding Yzma and Kronk who are on the hunt. <br /> <br />This is probably one of the most unconventional films Disney's done in years. For one thing, the humor is very different, it's almost traditional comedy film-like the way it is. Kuzco narrates the film and at one point tells the audience later on in the film \\"this is where we left off\\". Only Kuzco on the screen ends up talking back so in essence the character is arguing with himself as the narrator. Quite odd. Not to mention later on the film's central villain turns out to be probably the most adorable one. <br /> <br />A film lives and dies by its casting. Many of our favorite characters just couldn't be seen unless certain somebody's playedthem. So we have Kuzco, voiced by David Spade. So basically the film's success is whether you actually like the guy. Personally I find he's funny when he's not on auto-pilot when he comes in now and then but he still sounds like that annoying I'm the man tone. The film really belongs to Patrick Warburton as Kronk who plays the dumb sidekick who happens to be smart at times. The rest are pretty good too with Eartha Kitt and John Goodman delivering their character's lines properly. <br /> <br />I'd say rent it first since no way are you getting another Disney prestige picture. By the way, if you can find it, get the 2nd release, the 2 disc ultimate edition. It has way more stuff than this, even the original first release has almost the exact same stuff. But just like Tarzan, the best release gets undermined by the worst release.

0140157352|4.0|I read this book many years ago, and although most of the information is common sense, I took to heart one strategy,  \\"Soft on people, tough on issues.\\" In my negotiations with others over the years, I have employed this strategy religiously to great advantage.  I recommend this book to employees who take issues personally.
0689853637|5.0|This is another of Robert Sabuda's enchantments.  'Winter's Tale' evokes winter snow and cold with its predominately white, glitter, and icy foil sculptures. If you have seen others of Sabuda's popup books you know they are not for young children to play with.  The delicate and intricate constructions can be easily damaged by careless handling and the text is better enjoyed by older readers. In this one, winter creatures pop out with each turn of the page: deer, fox, a moose, a bear, an owl, and of course there are the smaller creatures who live in the page pockets. The last page delivers an unexpected surprise.  I am a great fan of all of Sabuda's popup books. I enjoy them over and over. One cannot help but be entranced by the beauty he has created and amazed at his artistic vision.  Like his previous books, this one is beautiful!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|They will not allow me enough space to begin to tell how so completely enticed and thrilled I am to have this set. Will never understand how this was passed up as nothing less than a long running series on TV. Thankful that a movie was made to continue but also end this troop (maybe, just at least for now). The players in this will quickly become part of your everyday thought process. They leave lasting impressions as each has their own story, fitting together to become one. The humor, the passion, the compassion, shines through in this group. Our every day stuggles of good and evil, believing good will prevail is what brings this all together. Will never tire of watching this series over and over again. Some of the best Si-Fi on the market. <br />Nathan Fillion make a terrific screen saver too!
B000CNESU8|5.0|Brilliant, prophetic, and savagely funny, \\"Network\\" examines the consequences of a world that is increasingly governed by large corporations and globalization.  In \\"Network\\", this state of affairs is satirized through the machinations of fictional UBS, a multinational media giant.  The growth and survival of this corporate titan transcends all other considerations including humanity and morality. <br /> <br />UBS is aided in its quest for world domination by an unthinking, desensitized audience who are lulled into watching UBS' trashy, sensationalistic primetime lineup.  Their hightest rated show is a quasi \\"news and entertainment\\" program, \\"The Howard Beale Show\\".  Beale is an idealistic, legitimate newsman who suffers a televised nervous breakdown which, as it turns out, scores huge  Nielsen ratings. <br /> <br />The ruthless, opportunistic UBS executives waste no time in exploiting Beale's mental illness by giving him his own television series where his deranged rantings can serve as \\"entertainment\\" for the masses.  The Beale show is initially a big hit.  But the masses prove fickle, and they start to abandon the show when the novelty wears thin and when they no longer like what Beale is telling them.  The network executives are gravely concerned about the ratings descent because it could cost them their jobs.  With calculated efficiency, they devise a plan to get rid of Howard Beale while garnering big ratings in the process.   <br /> <br />\\"Network\\" is an unsparing indictment of corporate greed and corruption and the public's frequent complicity in the activities of big business.  Not that all big business is bad, but we are seeing increased negative effects from tremendous power and wealth concentrated in the hands of a few.  Profits are supplanting ethics.  Look at Enron, Worldcom, or the big oil companies.  The mega-mergering of so many huge corporations crushes competition and results in fewer and less diverse choices to consumers.  It can also damage our environment. <br /> <br />Capitalism is good, but unchecked capitalism without any sense of public responsibility, regulation, or fair play can cause much harm to many. We need a balance. Otherwise, the world as depicted in \\"Network\\", resembles reality more than it should. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />
B0009X766Y|5.0|The Sting is a movie that no collection is complete without. Even though it is 30 years old, it is still a movie to watch today. The plot is excellent, the writing quick and funny, and the acting makes the story come alive. There is no question as to why this won best film for its year. If you haven't seen it, quickly do so.
6305078564|5.0|I really enjoyed this reenactment of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice. I think the story, if you've read it is entertaining and fairly true to the book except for some minor differences. An excellent transition considering most books to movies tend to chop great portions. Colin Firth definitely steals the show with his presence. It's five hours long so unless you're planning a marathon viewing it will need to watched over a few days.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|This movie does for guitar what \\"Bend It Like Beckham\\" did for soccer. A lot of this movie might be called trite wishful thinking, but it's a wonderful fantasy if you're a guitar player. Every time I watch the guitar duel between Macchio and Steve Vai I get a hairy buzz. My fourteen-year-old put the whole movie on his ipod and then cut the duel out and put it under a separate heading. He's got his classmates enthralled, because they somehow missed the movie. Maybe their dads don't play guitar, maybe they didn't see the movie when it came out. It highlights the Malmsteenish possibilities of classical music transformed via electric guitar. Now I'm definitely going to buy a Steve Vai concert dvd and pay more attention to his Favored Nations label.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Hmm what can i say?. except i am sick of hearing appraise for bands such as green day and good charlotte and simple plan. and also i am SICK of there fan base of little 13 year old teenyboppers who think that what they are listening to is in a \\"nutshell\\" punk rock. ok elements of punk rock are definatly in green day. i can ashamedly say that i (was) a fan of nimrod and the bands older material...simply because of its catchyness and how they played with the times. but i would never have considered them a \\"punk\\" band. what disgusts me about green day fans is they (mostly) wouldnt have a clue who great artists such as the DK's are or maybe (shock horror) even the sex pistols. what i am trying to say is that green day are a simple commercially acceptable \\"pop-punk\\" band, and should not be categorised into a punk genre
0060736267|5.0|I read a lot of books... and rarely have I had the experience that I had with this one. Usually I devour the language... gulp at it and after I finish a book I find that, although I enjoyed it, I didn't gain anything from the experience other than a few killed hours.  <br />This book made me slow down. Instead of reading ravenously through the pages I found myself savoring the language. I laughed, and cried, and rolled my eyes at the sarcasm and irony, and gasped, and remembered, and felt attached to the characters. <br />I didn't read this book... I stood beside the characters and lived it with them.
006056251X|5.0|I must admit that this by far is her best work.  I waited impatiently for the third Wallflower book to come out (Devil in Winter) and I finally have a copy.   <br /> <br />The premise is simple.  Sweet and innocent Evie Jenner needs to get married and fast.  She picks Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent, as her means of obtaining a husband and getting away from her evil relatives.  Sebastian is only to happy to help, since he needs the money Evie will obtain when her father dies.  They marry and thus starts a very emotional read into both of them coming to terms with their feelings toward each other. <br /> <br />Evie is wary, but rightfully so since Sebastian is not known for his fidelity.  But what I loved most about this book is how Sebastian evolved into a wonderful person.  I loved Sebastians wit and sarcastic humor from It Happened One Autumn and it continues here.  In this book he tries so hard not to let Evie know that he cares for her.  He even tries to deny it to himself and at times becomes so frustrated and angry at his own vunerability in his relationship with Evie that you just want to hug him to make it better.  And I love the part about Evie's wedding ring toward the end of the book, when Sebastian becomes sick.  I won't tell you what it is, so as not to spoil the moment. <br /> <br />They are truly the perfect match for each other. <br /> <br />I can't wait for Scandal in Spring.  I sense that the hero is going to be just as great as Sebastian.

B000059Z8J|5.0|When i first heard of a Superman movie i remember hearing names like Robert Redford and other A list actors up for the title role.It took an unknown named Chris Reeve and a great supporting cast to bring one of the greatest comicbook heroes to life.It still holds up today to any of the comicbook movie that would follow.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I was directed to Damien Rice by Amazon (which I think is an excellent feature of the website) and bought this album with only hearing the samples on the site. I am so glad that I ordered it - absolutely a wonderful album. The Blower's Daughter is my favorite - and Cheers Darlin' my least favorite (the only song on the album I don't like). If you got to these reviews, it's probably because you like similar music...and if that is the case....go for it!
B000005H4F|5.0|There are a few reissues of this absolutely great Cannonball Adderley recording. The first five cuts on all the reissues are the same 5 cuts that make up the original vinyl LP. A few of the reissued CD's have an additional sixth cut. The sixth cut was discovered by Blue Note and initially released in Japan in 1982 and given the name \\"Allison's Uncle\\" because Nat Adderley's daughter was born on the day it was recorded. Further research revealed that the mystery tune is a Hank Jones composition that the pianist recorded as \\"Rangoon\\" with the Gigi Gryce/Donald Byrd Jazz Lab quintet for a Jubilee label in August 1957. Therefore, please be advised that \\"Allison's Uncle\\" and \\"Rangoon\\" and the same exact cut, just with a different name for the same song. I got this info from the Rudy Van Gelder Edition footnotes by Bob Blumenthal. Tidbits like this are very important to me and thought it might be valuable to others as well.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|I loved the firefly series. There was a lot of potential for numerous episodes to be made but in FOX's wisdom they thought some more reality TV is what was needed. FOOLS! All I can say about Serenity the movie is that it destroyed so many plot-lines I can only hope that this adventure took place years in the future of the show. That would allow them to tell all of the stories correctly. There is no accurately established time line so I guess it would be possible. All of the original characters from the series are here but in the movie version they seem a bit different. Some of the things the characters do and say just don't fit what was established in the TV series. and Kaylee has lost about 20lbs (which is also a shame!) Even after this movie there is SO MUCH left untold we should still expect more episodes. This movie would fit better in the 'verse only if they fill in the massive gap between the last show and serenity. It is definitely worth watching but it's finality may just piss you off too.
B00005JOFO|5.0|In my view, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is the most meaningful and important film to be made in my lifetime.  That is saying a lot, seeing I broke into the movie theater business as a projectionist at age 15, became a film exhibitor at age 17, and my 76th birthday is coming up in a few days.  I've seen a lot of movies! <br /> <br />I'm a gay man - have been all my life.  But that's like saying \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a \\"gay cowboy movie.\\"  It doesn't begin to tell the whole story. <br /> <br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" hit me like a lightning bolt.  I lived 50 years before I began to see anything representative of my life on any \\"silver\\" screen anywhere.  I lived over 75 years to see anything honest and real about gay men's lives in a movie.  That movie was \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\" <br /> <br />So much of my own life is depicted in \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\"  I fell in love with a boy in high school.  He never knew; I never told him.  I longed for him in silence.  In 1948, where I lived, a boy didn't tell another boy he loved him.  My secret love still haunted me when I got married at age 23 - because it never occurred to me that I could escape marriage. <br /> <br />I had a number of affairs with men during fifteen years of marriage, which astoundingly nobody, including my wife, picked up on.  When the burden of lies got to be too heavy to carry, I told my wife I was gay.  She and 3 children paid the price of societal intolerance when this happened.  This follows the story line of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" to a spooky degree - and this is why the film will doubtless change the rest of my life.  I know that at last people who would never know what gay men have gone through - and still do go through - now know because \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" came into their lives.  I find great comfort in that. <br />

Every aspect of circus and clown hi-jinks are explored with sometimes hilariously dire results. A shadow image of a dinosaur gobbles up onlookers; cotton candy blood banks where a klown occasionally takes a sip  using a crazy straw; bloodhounds crafted from twisted and shaped balloons; killer popcorn;flesh melting cream pies thrown in a security guards face with the heaping mass of cream and bone topped with a cherry and more zany antics too numerous to mention including John Vernon as a human ventriliquest \\"dummy\\".  This is not a movie to be watched expecting academy award caliber acting but be warned the movie is a dizzy delight and may cause fits of uncontrollable laughter. And a delicously nutty title song from The Dickies kick-starts this carnival of mirth, merriment and campy terror.

0143034901|5.0|Firstly, I will without hesitation tell you that this is one of the best books I have ever read, if not the best. Secondly, I will tell you that I tend to be overdramatic and use a lot of hyperbole. Thirdly, I will tell you that no hyperbole is used in the above statements.<br /><br />What starts out as an intriguing \\"love story for those who love books\\", so some reviewers have called it, turns into a twist-filled story thick with mystery, gothic romanticism, and intrigue of the best kind. Daniel Sempere is a young child who has recently lost his mother after the Civil War in Spain. His father takes him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a cavernous, hidden chamber full of books that have been saved from being lost. Daniel is instructed to choose one book, a book that he will guard for life. Daniel chooses \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" by Julian Carax, and takes it home. Later that night, he devours the book in one sitting, deciding in the wee hours of the morning to discover more about Julian Carax.<br /><br />Soon, however, he discovers that someone has destroyed all of Carax's books, save the one he holds, and that not much is known about the author anyway. Then, in the dead of night, he meets the mysterious figure who wants to purchase the book from him--a person who smells of burnt paper. Daniel declines, extremely suspicious of this man.<br /><br />...Actually, describing the plot of this story does not do it justice. There are subplots within subplots, mysteries within mysteries, and many a peculiar circumstance. The description is gorgeous, but the prose is reader-friendly and highly visual. And the ending! I guarantee that you won't be able to stop after you reach the final hundred pages.<br /><br />There are so many good things to say about this book, and none of them really tell the whole story. Sr. Zafon deserves more credit than I could ever give him for writing this wonderful story.
B00000G3PA|5.0|first of all, i was very surprised to see so many negative reviews on this site. not many movies have made me cry. this one is good. <br /> <br />the acting was pretty good, tho i didn't really understand why they put liv tyler in it...sry but she's not that good of an actress. this is the kind of movie that u can watch over and over again and not get bored. in fact i was just watching it lastnight (k it was on TNT. but i plan on buyin the dvd). had my tissue box ready cuz i knw i was goin' to cry. sucker for movies like this. the storyline is absolutely perfect. many would say that the science is really off but i mean c'mon. it's a film. it's fiction. stop being so critical and just watch the film. it's definitely a MUST-SEE. ur missing out if u haven't watch this yet <br /> <br />Ps. one of teh best movie songs is in this. aerosmith rocks!
B00005NKCM|5.0|Savour the wonderful premiere series of UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS in this great DVD box set.<br /><br />The saga of the Bellamy family and their lively, loyal servants at 165 Eaton Place went on to span 5 series and countless awards.  In the legendary first series we are introduced to politician Richard Bellamy (David Langton), his beautiful wife Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and their children James (Simon Williams) and Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).  Downstairs, their staff, Hudson the butler (Gordon Jackson), Mrs Bridges the cook (Angela Baddeley), Rose the maid (Jean Marsh) and Emily the scullery maid (Evin Crowley) attempt to uphold their own values whilst coming to grips with an ever-changing world.<br /><br />Originally-devised by actresses Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, the series explored the day-to-day life of servant and master in the Edwardian period, a time of great political and social upheaval. The series later took the Bellamy family into the First World War (Series 4, regarded by most as the greatest), the 1920s flapper period and the impending Stock Market crash (Series 5).<br /><br />As the series opens, it is the year 1903, and great changes are afoot for the Bellamy family.<br /><br />\\"On Trial\\" - Into the structured Bellamy household whirls the unconventional free-spirit Clemence Delise (Pauline Collins) who is applying for the new position of parlourmaid.  After Lady Marjorie re-names the girl Sarah, she is quickly inducted into the residence, but it soon becomes clear that Sarah's true calling isn't in domestic service.<br /><br />\\"The Mistress and the Maids\\" - Lady Marjorie sits for an important society painter, but it's Sarah who enflames his creative talents.<br /><br />\\"Board Wages\\" - When the Bellamy's leave London for the weekend, Sarah and the servants are left to their own devices.  But when James unexpectedly returns home early, Sarah is thrown into a dilemma which could see her walk away from Eaton Place.<br /><br />\\"The Path of Duty\\" - Elizabeth returns home from a German finishing school, but her stubborn, willful streak is still very much intact.  When she must make her formal society debut, Elizabeth exposes her parents to a huge scandal by running away.<br /><br />\\"A Suitable Marriage\\" - The visiting Baron von Rimmer seems the perfect prospective husband for Elizabeth...or is he?<br /><br />\\"A Cry for Help\\" - Richard becomes entangled in scandal when the new maid appeals for his assistance in a delicate private matter.<br /><br />\\"Magic Casements\\" - Lady Marjorie enjoys a tender but brief affair with one of James' military friends.<br /><br />\\"I Dies from Love\\" - Emily becomes infatuated with a footman, leading to dire consequences when her affections are not returned.<br /><br />\\"Why Was Her Door Locked?\\" - An emotionally-distraught Mrs Bridges plunges the Bellamy family into disgrace when she kidnaps a baby.<br /><br />\\"A Voice from the Past\\" - Whilst helping in a soup kitchen, James and Elizabeth stumble onto a homeless Sarah, and decide to take her back to Eaton Place.

0679413251|5.0|I was inspired to read this after seeing it at the bookstore, shortly after I watched the movie with Glenn Close and John Malkovich. <br /> <br />This epistulary novel is only moderately erotic, it must be said. Its chief virtue lies in its wit; this is not an aristocratic Kama Sutra. This is made clear in the editor's Introduction, and readers with this in mind will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />As noted, the novel is epistulary, which is to say each chapter is actually a letter written from one character to another. At times this is frustrating, as it requires more work on the part of the reader to appreciate all the subtle character nuances. This is not an easy book to read (it's not difficult either), but it is well worth the effort. <br /> <br />There ought not to be any moral scruples about it. All the characters who engage in immoral behavior are punished for it or eventually moved to repentance. There is much to learn from this work with regard to the sanctity of love; as well, de Laclos's feminist thesis is subtly but convincingly put forth in an entertaining and yet heartfelt manner. <br /> <br />This is a novel I recommend to all; I wish I had read it before watching the movie.
0767834739|5.0|This movie has everything you watch a Grade B flick for-- violence, gore, explosions, action, and nudity-- never mind that the nudes are zombies and aren't particularly attractive; the tight mini skirts of the female protagonists more than make up for that. <br /> <br />In this sequel to Resident Evil, Milla Jovanovich is back as Alice, as is her friend, Matt-- although Matt has been turned into a superhuman machine killing machine.  <br /> <br />Alice faces zombie dogs, zombie children and zombie corpses as she attempts to help a group of special force members rescue the child of one of the scientists who is responsible for the virus. The most terrifying evil she faces, however, is not the zombies, but the architects of Raccoon City, who are also the scientists experimenting with genetic mutations. <br /> <br />If you like Grade B movies, you'll love this one!
B00000IMTH|5.0|This album is a brilliant fantasy metal album. It's not as good as Rising but what is? The best songs are Lady Of The Lake, L.A Connection, Gates Of Babylon, Kill The King and Rainbow Eyes. This album has many influences including folk, power metal, blues and classical. Dio, Blackmore and Cozy Powell have never sounded better!
B00004YX39|4.0|The ultimate ear candy. What it is, I am not 100% sure. It epitomizes the Southern California lifestyle. <br /> <br />\\"Babylon Sisters\\" and \\"Glamour Profession\\" should be the standards to test ALL sound systems (along with \\"In My Room\\" by the Beach Boys, of course). <br /> <br />You don't need Cuervo Gold or \\"fine Columbian\\" to enjoy this sonic delight.
B00000IMTF|5.0|This is the best album ever. Rainbow gets heavier and faster on this album and just improve overall. Dio's vocals are out of this world and Blackmore's guitar playing is incredible. Every song on the album is a masterpeice. Tarot Woman is a fast power metal fantasy song, Run With The Wolf is a slower fantasy song, Starstruck is a fast neo classical song, Do You Close Your Eyes is a radio friendly rock song with a catchy riff and catchy chorus, Stargazer is an epic, power metal, neo classical metal masterpeice and the best song I've ever heard, A Light In Tbe Black is another epic power metal song which continues the Stargazer story execpt much faster this time, there are 2 long solos one is a keyboard solo and one is a guitar solo. Stargazer is the best song I've ever heard and the rest are classics aswell. Every musician on this album contributes there best performances ever on this album. This is by far the best album I've ever heard. Fans of Rainbow, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Elf, Dio, Stratovarius, yngwie Malmsteen, Hammerfall and metal and rock in general will love this as you can see from the other reviews.
B000268QB2|4.0|Hopes and Fears from the group Keane is good listening. The melodies are good, the lyrics are fine. In contrast to so many other groups Keane manages to produce a style of their own. One you can recognize out the the tons of sounds pouring from the radio stations. It's original, it's melodious and it's great music to make you feel good. <br /> <br />M. van Wezel
B00000IMTE|5.0|This isn't as much power metal/neo classical album like the next 2 but it's a great and diverse album. Man On The Silver Mountain, Still I'm Sad, Self Portrait, Catch the Rainbow, Temple Of The King and Snake Charmer are all classics. the weakest songs are If You Don't Like Rock N Roll and Black Sheep Of The Family. This album mixes neo classical metal, progressive rock, power metal, folk, classical music, classic rock and blues. The whole band sounds amazing. If you like rainbow's other albums, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Dio, Elf ect. than you'll like this.

B00005JO9J|5.0|I have never been a fan of hospital shows. So when I heard that there was a new show called Grey's Anatomy I thought it was going to be one for one season and the, canceled. Man was I wrong. I had been hearing raves about the new show so I thought I would force my self to watch at least five minutes of it. After watching only one minute I was hooked. I needed to know every thing about the show. Granted, I came to like the show in the middle of the season I have not missed a single episode.  <br /> <br />      There were so many things that I loved about the show. For example, the characters are phenomenal. The viewer really feels as if they know the person that they are watching. Also the character development is another factor that makes Grey's Anatomy one of the best shows on television. The characters grow and make life changes right before your eyes.  <br /> <br />      All in all this is one if the best shows on television right now so I advise everyone to start watching.  <br /> <br />      The DVD is also amazing. I got it as a present and I had to watch every single show. It did take me a couple of days but I am now finally caught up. I hope that people either buy this DVD or start watching the show. You will fall in love with the characters, the story and everything in between.  I hope this review is helpful to everyone and I hope that you start watching the best show on television which would be Grey's Anatomy.

B00005JNEI|3.0|I avoided this documentary for quite some time, particularly due to all the hype over how powerful it was, and from other voices how lame it was.  Well, I finally watched it to discover that I found it to be neither overly powerful or overly lame, but a fairly normal documentary put together much like others, focusing on the Bush family.<br /><br />Ignoring the Republican/Democrat verbal boxing matches (lets face it folks, there is no discerning the two parties apart any longer, all we have are Republicrats) this documentary did actually have some information that all Americans, regardless of partisanship, should have knowledge of.<br /><br />Most important, in my opinion, are the Bush/Cheney ties to the Bin Laden family.  Perhaps it is true that they have cut off their black-sheep son Osama, but there was no reason to personally, and at tax-payer expense, fly Bin Laden family members out of the United States before the public caught wind of their presence.<br /><br />Also, a personal opinion, is that there should not be that much camaraderie between supposedly \\"competitive\\" oil sources, meaning American/Eastern oil sources.  If this high-level billionaire club competed more than co-joined, I believe we *might* see lower prices.  No promises though.  But it does seem like a horrible friendship to keep during wartime, which is what makes Moore's presentation of \\"hand-shaking\\" Bush/Bin Laden pics so funny when presented to the tune of 'Shiny Happy Faces'.  That was a nice touch.<br /><br />But the Bush's (both SR and Bubba) oil connections to the Bin Laden's should, IMHO, have been made available to the public long before any elections were held.  Plus, the tie in with the powerful Carlyle Group and their connections to Bush, Bin Laden, Cheney, and the new Middle Eastern Oil Pipeline project (a major project never covered by the media in the USA) should be of interest to everyone.  And, not to surprise anyone, but also Enron's Ken Lay's involvement.<br /><br />To me, I found the most humiliating moment of this documentary to be when President Bush addressed attendees of one his high priced political dinners, referring to him and those present as the \\"Haves\\" and \\"Have Mores\\".  How smug of a statement to make at an elite mixer while it is the \\"Have Nots\\" who are dying in his war.  This was the one piece of text, that, IMHO, makes this DVD worth a rent and a watch.  Unbelievable in its arrogance.<br /><br />The other alarming item I find with the new Republicrats is that, during the Clinton administration, millions of people died in the 1994 Rwanda Genocide, which was/would have been, a virtuous cause to aid a foreign country; but in the next administration outright war is declared on a country that was unproven to have executed the terrorism, the families of the terrorists were freed, and war was declared against a country that needed much less of our aid than Rwanda, all because they happen to have oil underneath their land.  Would that Rwanda have had oil, or some commodity to interest the 1%-Extreme-Wealth of our planet Earth, perhaps not so many would have died.<br /><br />Again, just my two cents.  I believe this film is worth watching as a documentary on war politics (not just Bush or Republican but Past, Present, Future Republicrats) to inform yourself of the behind the scenes schemes of the wealthy and some heart-breaking reality's of the \\"Have Nots\\" who never made it to Bubba's little dinner party.  Rent, don't buy.  Enjoy!/>To me, I found the most humiliating moment of this documentary to be when President Bush addressed attendees of one his high priced political dinners, referring to him and those present as the \\"Haves\\" and \\"Have Mores\\".

B00005JKZ3|3.0|Honestly, I bought this for a friend for Christmas (at their request), so my purchase doesn't reflex my desire to see the film. I saw it on video when it came out at Blockbuster, & it was OKAY. Not bad, not great. Too much CG, not enough human interaction. It's pretty much just more of the same stuff that was in the first movie, which is dissapointing considering how many years there were in between the two movies. I will say however, that this is the time I had ever seen or even heard of Rosario Dawson, & she acts well throughout. Oh yeah, and I almost forgot to mention, Lara Flynn Boyle is incredibly hot.
6305513406|5.0|These two episodes in very well remastered sound and video quality are a great way to begin the DVD release of Classic Star Trek.  I'm still hurting from having bought all the episodes just before the box sets were released but I've decided to move on and to talk about the versions that I have instead of moaning about the whole affair.<br /><br />Anyways, the screenplays for both these episodes are first class.  We get great acting and excitement here as both episodes encapsulate what everyone has grown to associate with Trek: the great storytelling, the humour and excitement all rolled up in 45 minute eps.<br /><br />Spock's character becomes more grim as the episodes continue but here on the first episode, he actually smiles a couple of times and he doesn't wear his trademark blue uniform until the next episode on this disc.  As any fan will tell you, not all the episodes have great stories or even good acting but that's certainly not the case with these two eps.<br /><br />If you are not keen on getting the whole set but are looking at selective titles, you should definitely ensure that this DVD is one of them.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B000002MU3|5.0|After the brilliant \\"Automatic For the People\\" which is destined to become one of the greatest ever albums, it came as a big surprise when \\"Monster\\" was released with that anthemic, signature, heavily-distorted opening chords of \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" and continues on with very experimental, grunge-like but still brilliant and original-sounding tracks.<br /><br />It took some getting used to but then it became clear to me that this was one great album and that R.E.M. took a gamble with the direction that they wanted their sound to go and on the whole, it paid off.  I actually got front row seats to watch them live soon after this release and they were excellent on stage!<br /><br />Don't believe what people may have told you but judge this album on its own merits and not on what R.E.M. may have done in the past; that's just immaterial and should not influence your opinion about the here and now.  If you didn't know that this was an R.E.M. album, you'd still think that this is a consistently great alternative/grunge album ala early Foo Fighters etc.<br /><br />There are no filler tracks here and the album has been very well produced and mastered as the sound quality is excellent too.  The best tracks and my favourites are \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\", \\"King of Comedy\\", \\"Bang and Blame\\", \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" and \\"Star 69\\" in that order.<br /><br />People have to realise that bands have to grow and I really respect R.E.M. for not resting on their laurels and settling for a proven formula just to sell records but in continuing to explore and experiment with new and different ideas which is what they've done here on this album.  In terms of the strength of the tracks on this album and the overall flow, this album is far better than \\"Out of Time\\" by a country mile.<br /><br />Very different-sounding to their best ever album, \\"Automatic for the People\\" but still very, very good.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0009MWEN0|5.0|Hi... I'm new reviewing articles here in Amazon, so i hope to give good advice to anyone interested.  <br />The movie is some kind of Platoon meets Starwars plus Sweet Valley high story. Althought at first, after the short introduction of Klendathu the movie slows down quite a bit during the high school part, but fortunately a few minutes later it gets speed again and don't lose it until basically the end of the show. <br />About the disc, the picture quality is great, and the sound is quite enjoyable, strongly recommended to have a good set of earphones to appreciate the real deal of the music and sound effects. <br />In a few words.... Great portable movie to go everywhere.

0743454537|5.0|I have just finished My Sister's Keeper; my first Picoult novel. I bought it on a lark and once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. Ms. Picoult is a master writer who has the ability to suck you in and make you feel as if you are a participant instead of a witness. For those of you who try it, hang in until the end; You will be so moved. Picoult's portrayal of her characters is so poignant that anyone with a healthy child will put down the book with a new respect for the blessings we have and admiration for those who must live through life-altering decisions that Anna, Kate, Brian and Sara must make. I highly recommend this book.  <br />

B00005KHJV|1.0|Reading the reviews of Amazon.com, one may come to the conclusion that John Carpenter's slasher-flick Halloween is the greatest horror movie ever created in the history of America and started the slasher genre.<br /><br />Well here's a real review, rooted a tad more in fact.<br /><br />This movie is the worst horror film ever.<br /><br />We start off with a young boy stabbing his naked sister to death. Sounds like a keeper!<br /><br />We then go into a long, tedious plot that involves, well, nothing really. The long wait the audience experiences before viewing much slice-and-dice action is apparently an attempt to aid it in learning more about the characters and to make a connection with the story. It fails in doing so. Rather, the audience is often left wondering if the only reason certain scenes are put into the movie is to make the runtime longer.<br /><br />With the exception of the infamous \\"Halloween theme,\\" the music is terribly irritating. There's about three songs in this movie, and usually, they are replayed several times over in long, useless scenes that you really feel the urge to fast forward to.<br /><br />Then, finally we are treated to some violence. But even the violence won't satsify those truly looking for a gorefest. Some scenes depict no blood at all.<br /><br />And when will the lie that Halloween \\"created the slasher genre\\" die? No, you are wrong. Psycho created the slasher genre, and Halloween is simply a modern adaptation. With a lot more nudity and sex which has nothing to do with the plot.<br /><br />Finally we reach the \\"showdown\\" between Michael Myers and... well it doesn't really matter who it is. It's just some girl that we hardly know anything about and really don't care for. The audience has no emotional attatchment to the main character at all.<br /><br />Jamie Lee Curtis, for reasons I cannot understand, is often described as a \\"strong female\\" character in this film. No she isn't. Her primary action throughout the \\"showdown\\" is to scream. She isn't even the one who ultimately defeats Michael. Dr. Loomis is.<br /><br />Then finally, we reach the terrifying ending where the somewhat-intriguing theme music plays as a soundloop of dog-like panting repeats in the background like a broken record. The horror!<br /><br />Want to see a truly disturbing slasher-flick with large quantities of gore balanced by a thought-provoking plot with important dialogue and realistic characters?

B000002I4W|4.0|This was a controversial album when it first came out, but you can forget all that and just buy it.  This is simply an excellent jazz album, and many of the songs on it have been covered by other artists.  Although free jazz can rightly sound forbidding, this album is very accessible.  The melodies are very catchy, and the playing is very good.  Don Cherry and Charlie Haden provide great support and soloing.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|I gave my review this particular title because, as successful as her debut album was, 'Like a Virgin', produced by Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers, is the LP that put Madonna on the map, no doubt!   <br /> <br />Every track on this album is masterfully done, in it's own way.  What can you say about the Chic guy's (Nile, Bernard, Tony Thompson) they provide the groove that is unchallenged and gives Magonna's sound a rhythmic dose of Chic-ism. <br /> <br />Like a Virgin, displays Madonna, in what I think is, her best LP.  This LP took her from the 'borderline' of smelling success, to actually achieving it.  Everyone knows all the attention, her video for Like a Virgin generated.  Madonna was hot, and the LP was even hotter.  <br /> <br />I think Madonna will attest herself, that this LP was her turning point, because after this release, she saw undaunted success, awards, and her tours were always inventive musical showcases. <br /> <br />I always pull this LP out of the archives to listen to, because it's a fun album, and has good rhythm.  Much kudos to Nile & Bernard, your talents shine through every artist you touch. <br /> <br />Peace to All <br /> <br />Michael A. Hicks (aka MHBass)
B0000069NM|3.0|Sometimes combining two big jazz players (or a player and a group) can result in something great.  Think Thelonious Monk & John Coltrane.  Ornette Coleman & Pat Metheny.  This disc is an example, though, of 1 + 1 = 1 1/2.  While John Scofield is his usual impeccable self, MM&W holds back too much. The songs are all written by Scofield, so I imagine MM&W couldn't adapt to his tunes.  Maybe they shouldn't have spent more time together developing a good groove.  At any rate, there are good songs, \\"Hottentot\\" (a few different groups cover Hottentot in shows found on the Live Music Archive), \\"Jeep on 35\\", \\"Green Tea\\", \\"Chank\\" & \\"Boozer\\".  All in all, though, it's just not very inspiring to listen to.
006056251X|5.0|I enjoyed the previous two books in the Wallflower series, but this one was fantastic -- I stayed up till 2 AM to finish it, which is always a good sign. If you like Lisa Kleypas' 1994 \\"Dreaming of You\\" (Derek Craven's story) then you'll love this one too. Nothing like a flawed hero to make a girl's heart flutter. The unlikely matchup of wallflower Evie Jenner and the scandalous rake Viscount St. James is filled with fireworks, tender moments, life-and-death scenes, and all the right elements to make one fantastic book. The fourth book in this series is due out on August 1st and I can hardly wait!
B000B0QOJA|4.0|This is the  \\"lost tape\\" radio performance from the Half Note.  John Coltrane is in a transitional phase, where he's still playing in the \\"Love Supreme\\" style and with Tyner, Garrison, and Jones.  But, he soon gets freer.  This is an excellent disc that rewards all levels of listening.  You can listen closely, or listen while you're doing something else.  Either way, Coltrane's lengthy solos are superb.  With some jazz music, long songs begin to wear their welcome thin.  That is not a problem here.  The radio announcer talks over the songs as the band is faded out.  How much longer did they play before they stopped?
B000E1YVZU|3.0|What makes Rent unique is that it was the first Broadway production that put the lights on AIDS and HIV.  It is also the second show that openly depicted gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) issues on the main stage in New York, since the Broadway musical La Cage aux Folles in 1983.  A decade after its opening, Rent received its cinematic treatment.  It kept most of its original cast members from the stage, which helped bring about the same feel from the stage.  However, it does not possess the same uniqueness in the cinematic realm, as film has openly portrayed gay issues over the last 15 years through terrific films such as Maurice (1987), Philadelphia (1993), Bound (1996), Boys Don't Cry (1999), and most recently Brokeback Mountain (2005).  In addition, films such as the disturbing cult New York film Kids (1995) and the television film And the Band Played On (1993) handled the issue of HIV and AIDS even before the premiere of the stage musical.  Despite its lack of cinematic rareness, Rent still helps shed some important light on HIV/AIDS and GLBT issues, and does so through much music and song.<br /><br />In the shadow of AIDS and HIV the audience gets to experience a musical with roots in Puccini's opera La boh&egrave;me, which is set in the Alphabet City of New York City.  It is a location where artists and others with non-traditional life philosophies sought refuge including myriads of poverty stricken people.  Alphabet City also suffered from drugs and violent crimes during the 1980s, which is when Rent takes place and follows the fate of eight friends and lovers.  The social setting is almost more important than the characters in the film, as the atmosphere in which they live heavily colors their political, social, economical perspective on life.<br /><br />The opening shot with the eight main characters on a stage allows the audience to draw that it is a stage musical moved to a set, as they sing the Seasons of Love.  Abruptly, the imagery moves from the countdown to one of filmmaker Mark Cohen's (Anthony Rapp) 8mm films that show the gritty and poor part of New York that many want to escape.  Instead, Mark embraces it by showing it to the audience, which helps set the tone of the film.<br /><br />Amidst the New York chaos, one character after another appears through song, as we get to know them as friends such as Mark's roommate Roger Davis (Adam Pascal).  He is musician struggling with coming up with the perfect song while constantly remaining in a glum state pondering the past and his acquisition of AIDS through a dirty drug needle.  They have a friend Tom Collins (Jesse L, Martin), a gay non-tenured NYU college professor with AIDS, who often stays with them at their place.  Mark and Roger also have a former friend, Benjamin Coffin III (Taye Diggs) whom they now loathe, as he has become their landlord while imposing rules and rent on them, as he sold them out by joining the aristocratic society.  Simultaneously, Mark suffers from a broken heart, as his girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel) has left him for the IVY-League graduate Joanne (Tracie Thoms).  Last, but certainly not least, Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia), a flamboyant transvestite, suffers from AIDS, but also expresses a strong affectionate love for Tom Collins that he reciprocates.  Together these eight characters go through a year of emotional ups and downs cornered by sadness, disappointments, and death which ultimately regains itself like bird Phoenix out of the ashes by spreading its wings of love.<br /><br />The musical aspect attempts to carry a triumphantly poignant celebration of love and mutually painful struggle in the shadow of death and illness.  However, it is not always so easy on the ear, as it aurally provides some cinematic gracelessness.  Much of the awkwardness emerges in the story line driven by its overwhelming song and lyrics, as the audience almost never gets a chance to breath or contemplate the importance of each piece between the musical numbers.  In addition, in some instances the lyrics sound awkward through their gawky rhyming.  Besides the musical portion, the audience will also lose interest in the characters, as the film self-indulgently begins to entertain itself in the revolutionary undertones that displays by \\"sticking it to the man.\\"  In a story where people's emotions are essential, as a viewer I almost felt cheated, because the psychological aspects of the characters were never fully portrayed in the way film only can provide.  Instead, the film leans too heavily on the music, as if it exclusively would bring about the emotional moments in the film, which makes it feel that the director Columbus never elevated the stage musical to what cinema could help create.  In the end, Rent provides a superficially intriguing musical, but never reaches the accomplishments of other contemporary film musicals such as Moulin Rouge! (2001) and Chicago (2002), or even close to the many musicals from the 1950s and 60s.etween the musical numbers.  In addition, in some instances the lyrics sound awkward through their gawky rhyming.  Besides the musical portion, the audience will also lose interest in the characters, as the film self-indulgently begins to entertain itself in the revolutionary undertones that displays by \\"sticking it to the man.\\"  In a story where people's emotions are essential, as a viewer I almost felt cheated, because the psychological aspects of the characters were never fully portrayed in the way film only can provide.  Instead, the film leans too heavily on the music, as if it exclusively would bring about the emotional moments in the film, which makes it feel that the director Columbus never elevated the stage musical to what cinema could help create.  In the end, Rent provides a superficially intriguing musical, but never reaches the accomplishments of other contemporary film musicals such as Moulin Rouge! (2001) and Chicago (2002), or even close to the many musicals from the 1950s and 60s.
B00004VWAF|4.0|\\"On The Corner\\" is way out there.  If you don't like rock as well as Miles' other work, I think \\"On The Corner\\" would be very difficult to get through.  The bass sounds looped for long sections, making very few changes.  The hi-hat skitters and the keyboards are used to antagonize.  The lead guitar parts are fairly straightforward for 70's fusion.  \\"Black Satin\\" has some great funky handclaps and bells offsetting a whimsical melody.  Sometimes I feel Miles' wah-wah trumpet gets lost trying to be experimental.  At times he puts more value on sounding far-out than I'd like.  Ultimately, if you like the idea of top jazz players going outside of jazz (and outside of rock fusion, too!) you'll get something out of \\"On The Corner\\".
B00006J3WH|5.0|i love the music. it gives the words for each song and it even plays the short funny songs on the episode. there could be no better sound track for Buffy than this. it also gives sound clips from \\"Hush\\" and \\"Restless\\".
B00000I8UK|4.0|Eric Dolphy gets a little kooky, or, er, \\"Out To Lunch\\" on this record.  It has very good free playing from him, Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, Tony Williams, and Richard Williams on bass.  Gazzelloni and the title track are a little more memorable than the others, but none disappoint.  This album takes a little getting used to, it isn't a very accessible free album, but neither is it overly difficult.
0802136834|2.0|When I purchased this book, I was skeptical because I thought it might be another dull book about English history.  I was absolutely wrong - this is a great book!  Weir does a great job of telling this story.  It is not six separate biographies.  Instead, Weir weaves the story of each wife around the life of Henry VIII.  Ann of Cleves is a particulary sad story, and she comes across as the most likable of Henry's wives.  On the other hand, Ann Boleyn is portrayed as a scheming, ill-tempered snob who constantly meddles in the affairs of state, which ultimately leads to her unfortunate death.  Henry is accurately portrayed as a controlling and sometimes distant husband and father.  You won't be disappointed in this book - it's one of Weir's best works.
B000022TSW|5.0|It is as funny as it is dirty. If you enjoy dark sarcasm, this movie will suit you well. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are a lot more creative than most people give them credit for. \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut\\" does more than entertain us with blatant mockery and fart jokes. It has personality (... a crappy personality, but great none-the-less). It is entertaining time and time again not only because we can associate the situations and characters in this movie to people we know and events that happen in the world, but because one of the countless implications that are made in this movie may have new meaning each time the movie is seen. I give this movie 5 stars for creativity and personality (Aside from the fact I find it more and more hilarious the more I watch it). Some say you have to turn your brain off for this movie, and for many people I can see why that might be a good approach to this movie, however I prefer to read between the lines. In a movie that is this blunt and tactless, it is easy to be wildly entertained.
0553801503|5.0|I'll try to keep this brief. I don't want to go into chapter analyses and I will try not to spoil anything for those who haven't read this book yet. I'll only say this. While not every reviewer will like this book, as is their right, I think its wise to recall that  the War Of The Five Kings is Westeros is pretty much over at this point. What comes after a war? The victors (or the survivors) will jockey for position to get as much of the spoils as they can. That's what we see here, A realm trying to right itself and stagger on into the future after a long and brutal war. Like a murder of crows gathering over a veritable smorgasbord of prey, the book hints at shadows of things to come. I loved the sense of gathering tension in this book, like gathering stormclouds. You know the tempest is going to come, and this volume is like a fair sky slowly turning dark before a massive thunderstorm. It gives a taste of things that may yet come to pass.         I, for one... absolutely love this book. I love the sense of the veneer of 'peace' slowly being taken away as the realm is threated with shadows of things yet to be. Bring on A Dance With Dragons, I say, and let me have the privilidge of being one of millions of readers to dance along with them.
B0001AP158|5.0|It did not surprise me. I knew it would be great, as always.
B0002OERI0|4.0|...in my opinion Green Day was MUCH better when they weren't so public and a lot of people didn't know about them.<br /><br />Being a huge Green Day since WAY before Idiot came out, I bought it on the first day. I liked every song on it, and thought it ruled over both Nimrod and Insomniac, but (as usual) wasn't good enough to beat the all-powerful Dookie.<br /><br />Let's take it a bit slower. Before Idiot was released, my friends always thought I was a nerd listening to Green Day. \\"They're so old!!\\" they would say. \\"I'd rather listen to Good Charlotte!\\" Was another.<br /><br />Then, when Idiot came out, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM was walking around with their iPods singing \\"My shadow's only thing that walks beside me...\\"<br /><br />I liked Green Day more when they weren't so public, as I said before.<br /><br />So, I brushed it off my shoulder and thought \\"Just give it some time. They'll grow old of it.\\" Hell was I wrong. Now, I can't turn on the radio without hearing Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Yes, its a great song, but WAY overplayed on the radio.<br /><br />Sorry, but people who listened to that song on the radio and haven't even heard any of Green Day's original music aren't true Green Day fans.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; I love this CD. But it just bugs me that now every single person in the world knows about them. Ok. Time for song breakdown.<br /><br />1. American Idiot(3.5/5)--Nothing special. It doesn't have the 'WOW' factor about it. But its an ok song.<br /><br />2. Jesus of Suburbia(5/5)--One of my fav. Green Day songs. Everytime I listen to it I find myself blaring it. The Live Track is even better!!<br /><br />3. Holiday(4/5)--Green day meets The Clash. This is a good song, but again, overplayed on the radio!! Good song though.<br /><br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams(4.5/5)--.5 points taken off because of the radio nightmares this song has caused. Amazing song, but AGH its so old now becuase of damn Z100.<br /><br />5. Are We The Waiting(3.5/5)--A weird song, even for Green Day. I usually skip it.<br /><br />6. St. Jimmy(4/5)--Fun when you first hear it, but gets old  and quick.<br /><br />7. Give Me Novacaine(4/5)--It's good. Again, no 'WOW' factor. Worth a listen though.<br /><br />8. She's A Rebel(4.5/5)--Short and sweet! A lot of people hate this song but I love it; maybe I'm just weird.<br /><br />9. Extraordinary Girl(4.5/5)--Green Day meets the Beatles!! Billie Joe even sounds a tad like John Lennon!! A great song.<br /><br />10. Letterbomb(5/5)--This is classic Green Day, no doubt about it. Bouncy, a good beat, and great guitar parts. One of my favorite tracks on the CD.<br /><br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends(4/5)--see Track 4's Description.<br /><br />12. Homecoming(3.5/5)--Not one of my favorites. Its still good though. It gets old as you listen to it repeatedly.<br /><br />13. Whatsername(10000/5)--No Comment. Too shocked to type.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad CD at all.

B00005RDRO|4.0|This is a very funny movie which parodies great detectives of literature and film. The ending is a bit convoluted so I gave the movie 4 stars.  However, you will enjoy this movie and laugh at the characterizations by Peter Sellers as Sidney Wang (an hysterical take off on thc Charlie Chan character), Peter Falk as Sam Diamond (vs Sam Spade), Elsa Lanchester as Jessica Marbles (Marples), James Coca as Monsieur Perrier (Hercule Poirot) and David Niven and Maggie Smith as Dick and Dora Charleston (a nice take off on Powell/Loy duo Nick and Nora Charles).  The dialogue is pure Neil Simon, quick and clever. A blind butler excellenty played by Sir Alec Guiness adds to the hilarity.   Buy this film and you will not be sorry...
0385504209|3.0|The DaVici Code is the rare book that will inspire plenty of debate long after you've finished reading it and will have you scrutinizing artwork you've taken for granted over the years.Loaded with puzzles and clues this thriller relies more on smarts than firepower.This is 2nd adventure of the Robert Langdon character and truth be told his first book Angels and Demons was a better story.With literal ticking bomb intensity and writer Dan Brown first devoloping his writing style that he carries over to this book Angels and Demons felt more fresh and intensely focused.Having said that however The DaVinci Code is a very fun if not great book.Brown has a gift for filling his book with interesting information without it getting in the way of the suspense.The DaVinci Code has a lot to make you go hmmm and with plenty of twists and intriguing puzzles(that would be a crime to give away by writing about them here)it's a fast read.You may not agree with everything of a religious aspect in this book but you'll be undeniably entertained.
078681859X|4.0|This is a witty book. I enjoy the footnote format as it adds to the arrogant personality of Bartimaeus. The sentence structure at times doesn't match the pace of the story and can seem a little tedious but overall holds my attention. I like the stab at JK Rowling early on and I'm sure she'd appreciate it as well. I am not sure if the constant back and forth of flashbacks and current action make the overall plot (a la Pulp Fiction) accessible to children but I'll wait to see when I've finished. This is a great addition to children's fiction or for adults like me who are a little discontent with adult literature at the moment.
B000002JB8|5.0|A timeless new age masterpiece better than Yanni or Enya is like an aquatic daydream perfect for any occassion.Ethreal voices drift in and out in some parts while gentle rythmims populate other tracks along with minimal but effective water effects.Most new age music blandly fades away into the background and while this cd won't overpower you you'll notice that it's very distinctive in it's aural beauty.Much more than a forgettable soundscape if you have the slightest interest in quality new age music this is a musthave!!
B00000G3PA|2.0|Armageddon is an action movie with serious delusions of grandeur. Michael Bay's blockbuster is a sort of comic book brought to life, an over-stylized apocalyptic spectacle born of a generation raised on music videos--something that is especially evident in sequence after sequence edited to fit with the film's Aerosmith-dominated soundtrack. The pacing is frantic from the first fiery frames. Visual effects are clean but clearly overdone. The cast is bloated, with many of the comic back-ups overshadowing a set of forgettable heroes, and though the script makes great efforts to grant most of the lead characters an emotional moment this only serves to emphasize the cruel disregard offered to the movie's many victims. Those emotional moments almost always seem sentimental or forced, though they're soon lost in a wash of action and disaster. At one point Billy Bob Thornton succinctly promises the asteroid approaching Earth will bring \\"basically the worst parts of the Bible,\\" and this is what the film goes on to deliver. Suffering greatest of all amidst all of this is the film's credibility. Armageddon is, first and foremost, almost utterly unbelievable. This is a critical flaw that weakens the integrity of the plot from the first scenes set at NASA control. It's rare that any element, from design to dialogue, reinforces the dramatic reality of the situation or its consequences. It's a big movie that tries to be much, much bigger--truly, as apocalyptic epics go, Bay's Armageddon is petty and easily overshadowed. At its best, Armageddon entertains on the basest levels. At its worst, it cheapens a great many potent images and potentially powerful themes with its flashy approach. Unfortunately, it's not difficult to fathom that a movie this expensive could ultimately seem so cheap.<br /><br />--Brian A. Dixon<br /><br />Revelation Magazine
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Now, this was a very very good movie and Reese and Jaoquin did an amazing job at the acting but they did not focus enough on the music and stuff but rather the romance... i loved the movie though
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Mariah Carey re-entered the musical scene in early 2005. All eyes were on Mariah as people were wary, scared and just undecided on whether she would be able to make a \\"big bang\\" or if her promotional efforts would just fizzle and fade as did the 2001 Glitter soundtrack (certified Gold) and 2002 Charmbracelet (certified Platinum). For an artist with a track record where each of her CDs have sold at least 3 million copies, people wondered if Mariah's hey-day was gone. Well, one solace was the fact that the title was not going to be as sugary. No rainbows, no butterflies, no glitter, no daydreams, but an emancipation of Mimi. Who's Mimi? <br /> <br />It's Like That-Produced by Jermaine Dupri, Mariah Carey and Manuel Seal and featuring Fat Man Scoop (Missy's Lose Control), this cut is the party-starter that kicked off the successful singles wave for the CD. It has a lot of energy. It's fun and free, which is something Mariah needed. It's not forced fun, and it works. It's one of my favorite cuts with its prominent beats and Fat Man Scoop's crazy energy. A+ <br /> <br />We Belong Together-Produced by Jermaine Dupri, Mariah Carey and Manuel Seal and containing elements of \\"Two Occasions\\" and \\"If you Think you're Lonely Now\\" (Bobby Womack), this was the second single off the CD taking radio by storm and reaching the very highest echelon on the Billboard Hot 100 song. I knew that Mariah was back when at the high school I was tutoring at, the students were incessantly singing this song and it was used as the theme song for the prom. Although Mariah sings straight-down-the-middle until the end, it's the right interpretation for this mournful song of longing. A+ <br /> <br />Shake It Off-Produced by Jermaine Dupri, Mariah Carey and Bryan Michael Cox, this was Mariah's third single and it reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. It's the \\"hot\\" mid-tempo that stormed the charts in summer 2005. I personally got tired of the song, and I don't like it as much as It's Like That, but it's nevertheless a pretty decent song; although, it sounds like something someone younger than Mariah would tackle. B <br /> <br />Mine Again-Produced by James Poyser and Mariah Carey, this slow Quiet Storm ballad which hearkens back to old soul from the 70s finds Mariah Carey letting loose and doing her thing as she laments over the fact that the love lost can be hers again because she feels they are both ready. This was spun on Urban stations here in Chicago, and I began to really appreciate the song because it was played so much. Mariah's interpretation is on-point. She's always in pitch, and the way she does the vocal tricks and flips especially toward the end solidified the fact that she's still a formidable vocal force. I also enjoy how she used the high note to great effect at the very end. A+ <br /> <br />Say Somethin'-Produced by The Neptunes and featuring Snoop Dogg, this was one of the top contenders for the first and/or third single. I personally like the mid-tempo because it's laidback. It has a retro soul sound to it, but with The Neptunes' production, it is updated enough to fit the 2005 musical landscape. Snoop Dogg turns in a tight rap to give the song an added edge, and the song is nice to bump in a whip. I think it could still work as a single. A+ <br /> <br />Stay the Night-Produced by Kanye West and Mariah Carey and featuring elements of \\"Betcha By Golly Wow\\" as performed by Ramsey Lewis, this old school soul mid-tempo by Kanye was not initially what I expected from Kanye upon seeing him as the producer. However, many people think this could be a single and make some ends on radio. I don't agree with that viewpoint. Even though it's a \\"hot\\" song, it kind of stifles the momentum of the previous 5 songs, and for me, it really does nothing. It's a nice album filler, but it does not go beyond that. The ending is also kind of weird. B+ <br /> <br />Get your Number-Produced by Jermaine Dupri, Mariah Carey and Lroc and featuring Jermaine Dupri who soundsa lot like Nelly, and containing elements of \\"Just An Illusion,\\" this self-centered mid-tempo has that 80s retro, synth-laden sound to it. But Mariah turns in some sexy, appropriate vocals and Jermaine gives the right energy. This song sounds a lot like something that Janet Jackson could tackle and it would fit her as well. However, Mariah does a good job with it turning in one of those bird-high notes at the end. The chorus is catchy, and it's a unique song into today's musical landscape. A- <br /> <br />One and Only-Produced by The Legendary Traxster and Mariah Carey and featuring Twista, this sexy slower cut is a perfect song for Mariah. It has a catchy hook. The dark mood of the song has that tight Hip-Hop meets R&B vibe to it, and the way that the verses flow, it's almost as if Mariah is rapping. Twista also gives an energetic, rapid-fire rap that fits the song. It's as if this song was made for Twista himself because it fits him. Mariah and Twista could even cut a whole CD together because to me, their styles complement one another's. This could definitely work as a single. A+ <br /> <br />Circles-Produced by Mariah Carey and James \\"Big Jim\\" Wright, this old school soul slow jam has Mariah singing circles around the music as she talks about the circles her love keeps taking her for a lost love. Mariah uses her vocals to great effect. The background vocals are on-point, and it's good for us youngings to hear how old music was arranged, sang and presented. I know many people contend that this could make it as a single. I don't know about that, but I do know that it's more than just an album filler, and it exemplifies Mariah's vocal range and interpretation abilities. A <br /> <br />Your Girl-Produced by Scram Jones and Mariah Carey and containing elements of \\"A Life with you\\" performed by Adeaze, this mid-tempo is hot. It has a nice, laidback beat. The verses and the chorus are catchy and Mariah's voice is on-point. The top thing that makes this song work is that although, it is the quintessential song for a guest rapper, Mariah holds the song down herself and brings it home. I could see this working on Rhytmic and Pop stations. It's a fun, bubblegum song that fits Mariah well. I could've seen this on her Rainbow (1999) or Charmbracelet (2002) releases. A+ <br /> <br />I Wish you Knew-Produced by James \\"Big Jim\\" Wright and Mariah Carey, here's another old school slow jam in the vein of Circles, but it's not as good as Circles although it works. It has a mock crowd screaming at the beginning and the way the song is arranged, it sounds live. Mariah does her vocal acrobatics here, and she uses the high note to great effect at the right spot. It's not one of my favorite songs and for me, it's album filler, but it's another evidence for how old school songs were. B+ <br />To the Floor-Produced by The Neptunes and featuring Nelly, this song does not work as well as one would surmise. With The Neptunes and the pop rapper himself, Nelly, you would think the song would have as much energy and charisma as some of the previous tracks like One and Only with Twista or Say Somethin' with Snoop Dogg, but this old school mid-tempo does not go anywhere, and it sounds more so like album filler than a single contender especially after going through so many previous tracks that could all work on various formats as singles. It's no wonder that this song was scrapped as the first single. Although the title alludes to a party joint, it just does have enough energy/spark to actually be a party joint and it leaves the listener wanting more. Here's hoping that next time, Mariah and Nelly can have a better song to feature their talents because I do think they have good chemistry. B <br /> <br />Joy Ride-Produced by Young Genius and Mariah Carey, this mid-tempo, sugary song is like a blending of Bliss from 1999 Rainbow and Yours from 2002 Charmbracelet. It's a sweet song with some kill-fire background vocals, and it just fits Mariah's style so wellbecause this is what we expect from her. I could definitely see her performing this cut live, and it's actually one of my favorite cuts on the CD. A+ <br /> <br />Fly Like a Bird-Produced by Mariah Carey and James \\"Big Jim\\" Wright, this Gospel mid-tempo finds Mariah turning in a more spirited \\"Saving Grace\\" as she sings about truly transcending her woes and burdens with God's help. I personally don't care for how the song is arranged, and it's not what you expect from a song of this nature, but the message is what really gives the song extra points. Also, the perfect high notes that Mariah lets out at the end that sound just like something that would be sang in a church shows Mariah got soul and she got some Gospel in her blood. A <br /> <br />Don't Forget About Us-Produced by Jermaine Dupri, Mariah Carey and Bryan Michael Cox, this is the song the fueled my decision to get the re-release of TEOM. For me, this is probably my favorite song of 2005. I like it better than anything else on the CD including We Belong Together. It has more fire. It has a tight, infectious beat and a catchy chorus. Mariah does not wait until the end to let loose. She does it all throughout the song, and she shows that she can hold it down with the high notes and the vocal frills. This song is tightness. It's also good that it reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. A+ <br /> <br />Make It Last All Night-Produced by Jermaine Dupri, Mariah Carey and Bryan Michael Cox, here's a mid-tempo that is a contender to be the 5th single from the CD; although to me, it sounds like a song from the late 90s. Was this not included on her 1999 Rainbow CD? It's a good album filler. It's listenable, but a single it's not. It seems the record label is trying to play it safe by going with songs produced by Jermaine Dupri. B <br /> <br />So Lonely (One and Only Part II)-Produced by Rodney \\"Darkchild\\" Jerkins and featuring Twista, this is another reason why I picked the CD up even though I got Twista's 2005 The DayAfter with this cut on it. I don't know why, but Mariah Carey and Twista sound tight together. Their style on both One and Only and this cut epitomizes my assertion that they should cut a whole CD together because Mariah's sexiness and her vocal abilities mixed with the way their songs are produced and Twista's hardcore but rapid-fire deliveries are on-point. I am still perplexed as to why this has not been officially been released as a single because it would take radio by storm and would propel the sales for both artists. A+ <br /> <br />We Belong Together Remix-Produced by DJ Clue and JoVonn \\"The Last Don\\" Alexander and featuring Jadakiss (Why) and Styles P (I'm Black) and containing elements of \\"Two Occasions\\" and \\"If you Think you're Lonely Now,\\" I don't care for this remix much because the original is so tight. I wish they would've included the Shake It Off remix with JayZ because that was hot, but this song is alright. B+ <br /> <br />Overall, Mariah definitely has experienced a comeback: 2 #1 singles, a # 2 single, and a top 20 single; over 5 million copies sold; and numerous awards and TV appearances. I don't think this was go down in history as a classic album along the lines of Michael Jackson's Thriller, etc, but it will go down as a memorable effort. It's not just a CD of the moment, but music critics, insiders will remember how people wrote Mariah off after 2001, but how she came back hitting hard with a well-polished, well-produced, contemporary CD that featured The Neptunes and Jermaine Dupri, who has been responsible for all 4 of her hit singles. She also shows that she still has her vocals at 35 years old. Although somewhat raspy, she can still belt and she also still has the vocal trills/bird notes. Although the CD is almost a year old, I haven't tired of it. Here's to looking forward to her next CD and wishing the best for other veteran divas Janet Jackson and one of my favorites, Whitney Houston.
0446310786|4.0|I have to admit, this book started off slow. But then towards page fifty I began to understand why this book is so popular. Scout is so young and she doesn't understand much, but she's like most 8-year olds and she thinks fairly and begins to realize that most people are unfair and unjust, and that's just how it is.<br /><br />I liked how her relationship with Jem and Atticus don't really change throughout the book. When most people think of a love story they think of two people falling in love but this is a love story between a young girl and her family.
B000BVD460|5.0|It is already known that Eminem is the most commercially successful rapper, who has brought a different twist to Hip-Hop even if it can be attributed to the fact that he is a White rapper or that he is a character rapper (Ludacris, Missy Elliott) or the fact that he raps about different topics that most rappers would not even think to explore. With his four studio CDs (Slim Shady LP 1999, The Marshall Mathers Album 2000, The Eminem Show 2001 & ) and 8 Mile, the soundtrack, Emimen has sold  enough CDs to fill the state of Texas and netted a host of hit singles. This is a compilation of all of his top singles except for Superman. Now, most of these songs many have already heard, but it is a pleasure to have all of these hit songs, many of which are awesome musical pieces, assembled on one CD.  <br /> <br />The new songs are Fack, which is produced by Eminem and has that trademark Eminem sound that is unique and eccentric; Shake That featuring Nate Dogg and produced by Eminem, it is another song that is trademark Eminem but it fulfills another side of his persona as it is more serious than the parody-laden Fack; and When I'm Gone as produced by Eminem, which fulfills another component of Eminem's multi-faceted persona as it talks about his daughter, Hallie's, missing him while he's performing and his vow to return to her and take a break from music. All of these songs are pretty good, and When I'm Gone made a little noise at the end of 2005 on radio charts. <br /> <br />Overall, Emimem is a rap phenomenon as can be evidenced by the fact that there are even college courses that are centered on Eminem. It is difficult for some to decipher which side of Eminem they are getting on a song. Is it Slim Shady? Is it Marshall Mathers? Is it Eminem? Or is it a combination of all three? Some of my favorite cuts are Superman, The Way I Am, the impressive & creative Stan featuring Dido, Lose yourself which is uplifting and motivating to young people to reach for the stars, Sing forthe Moment which does the same thing, Like Toy Soldiers, Mockingbird. This is a nice add-on to anyone's collection to observe the artist that is Eminem. Even if all of these songs have been downloaded, it's still good to have them in one collection. I wonder if this is Eminem's curtain call or is it just the curtains closing only to soon open up to a new, more mature Eminem.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This CD is so exciting that I purchased the DVD, Celtic Woman, too. The music is crisp and clear and presented as vibrant and entertaining on many levels.  I would absolutely, without reservation recommend Celtic Woman CD and DVD to anyone interested in Celtic and other music expressions.
B000A59PMO|4.0|This season only recently aired in Australia and as I didn't have time to watch the entire series, this DVD came as a great purchase. Being able to watch the episodes in my own time and without ads made me appreciate the series even further. Can wait for the second series.
B000AADYYO|5.0|This album is my first encounter with the Prog/Deathmetalband Opeth. When I first heard it I didn't like it at all. This is because it isn't an album (and a band) you like when you hear it one time. So, few weeks later i decided to give this album a second chance. I listened the whole album carefully and knew this wasn't just music. It was art. Progressive rock/metal is, in my opinion, not easy-listening music. But when you listen to it closer and listen to all the instruments, the canging of the speed of the music, the strange sounds of a singer who can grunt and sing very well and combines this on an artistic way, you'll see that this music can only be made by very high-talented musicans. That is what the guys of Opeth in my opinion are, and this album will show you that this is pure art, which we should respect.
0060734191|5.0|Each one of these books are great, whether you are a young adult or an adult reader. Once you read the first one, you'll want to go straight to the next one. These books pacakaged together are a really good value.
B0000062FN|5.0|Agree that this is perhaps the peak of the first 3 Santana albums.  Also agree that later things came close at times, but never touched the energy and excitement of the first band. <br /> <br />Finally, there is one track that stands out as one of the masterpieces of all improvisational rock.  I do not know why it is not more broadly revered (such as ABB's Liz Reed), but in my view it is easily worth the price of this CD.  And it is.....'Touissaint L'Overture'!!!

B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a great Sci-Fi movie. I strongly suggest that you go ahead and purchase the tv series as well. You get a better feel for the characters, plus every episode is great. As many others have stated they would like to see the tv show come back, I wish it would too. So get the tv series & Serenity, you will not be dissapointed!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It was good to get a conclusion to the series.  The story line stayed true and answered many questions we never got when the series abruptly ended.  It would be nice to see a bit more.  I look forward to anything else Joss wants to send us.
0316172324|3.0|Blink is a collection of amazing stories centered around \\"the power to think without thinking.\\"  Your unconscious mind has come up with a decision quickly, perhaps in seconds, but you may not recognize it consciously for hours or even years later.  It's somehwat relatable to a gut feeling; you know something is what it is in your gut but cannot explain why you feel that way.  It is a quick and easy book to read.  The true stories are written in a well thought out cohesive flow and tend to be inspiring.<br /><br />Why 3 Stars?  Stories is all this book is, nothing more, nothing less.  If you expect this prior to purchasing the book, it will probably rate higher than 3 stars in your mind.  For some reason I was expecting this book to give pointers or guidance on how someone can \\"think without thinking\\" or, at least, more insight on to how the people in the stories accomplished this.  Although the stories are great, I did not feel left with a greater ability to \\"think without thinking.\\"  The book left me further aware that this phenomena can and does happen, but I was already aware of this prior to reading the book.
B00005JO1R|4.0|Phoenix really does a great character study here, he nails Cash, I was even surprised at how much he resembled Cash, considering he really looks nothing like him, it was a tribute to the research he did to get his famous mannerisms down..having said that, the movie belongs to the fabulous Witherspoon, she is fantastic in this film, and frankly she has never been more radiant.  She makes June Carter Cash real, she does not play her like a saint, she shows her flaws, but also her inner strength and goodness.  You really buy her deep love for Cash, it's really a career performance.  The movie itself is well paced and you stay with it, at first I thought it ended a bit abruptly, but thinking back on it, the ending was true to the film.  Highly recommended...thanks James.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Extremely powerful film. It shows how low humanity can sink in the search for happiness, and how people can fool themselves into thinking that their actions bring them joy while in reality they are on a self-destructive path. An incredible cast and everyone of them gave a solid performance, especially Ellen Burstyn.<br /><br />The film's strong point is how it satirizes modern day society's obsession with material values, the need for speed, immediate gratification and always seeking the quickest way for success rather than working hard for it. People may think that we live easier lives now than we did before, but despite our technological advancements and pharmaceutical aids, the lowest common denominator will always keep us down and prevent us from achieving happiness. Mankind's stupidity is on display in this film, in all its infamy and unholy glory.<br /><br />The scariest part of this film is that it speaks a great deal of truth about our species in the most honest, uncharacteristically clear and untainted point of view. Perhaps in a sense the pace of this film makes an indirect comment on how we rush through our lives without realizing how incredibly easy it really is to find, reach, grasp and hold onto happiness, but without anyone to tell or show us what it is, we blindly go on seeking that which we cannot find for the life of us. In this case it's the most extreme circumstances, but sadly it's not that uncommon, and it gives the audience a chance to maybe recognize some of their own flaws, strictly on the principle of the ideas presented.<br /><br />The manner in which the various characters transgress rapidly on the slippery slope of poor choices was superbly portrayed and directed.  It really doesn't take much for people to go from relative normalcy to complete and utter chaos and debasement, so this film serves as a warning to maintain a modicum of moderation throughout our lives, in all aspects of it.<br /><br />'Requiem For A Dream' was not very palatable for the public at large, hence it is not a very well known film but for any fan of movies as an art form should watch this movie for the skill contributed by the director's unique approach, not to mention the wonderful performances by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, Marlon Wayans and the magnificent Ellen Burstyn who gives the performance of her life.  As I previously mentioned, the message of the film is quite poignant as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film, but be warned, it's graphic, raw, disturbing and its memory will haunt its viewers.y palatable for the public at large, hence it is not a very well known film but for any fan of movies as an art form should watch this movie for the skill contributed by the director's unique approach, not to mention the wonderful performances by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, Marlon Wayans and the magnificent Ellen Burstyn who gives the performance of her life.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is a great film, I saw it at the theater a few years ago and was blown away, I really liked how the film goes forward and back, it felt fresh and original.  Guy Pearce is fantastic in this film, he is such an underrated actor, people often tell me I look like him, so it's weird to watch him in this role, because his character is so confused and lost, it really resonated.  It was so cool how he wrote things on his body so he would remember, you could feel his desperation, really a great performance.  I always suggest this film when people say that they can't find an original film.  If you appreciate great film making and enjoy a great performance then I can't imagine you not liking this film, it will stay with you.
B000002J20|5.0|Boy, this album feels like that special moment when you finally reach the top of a mountain.  Everything you ever wanted in an overblown progressive rock album can be found here, and more.  See that?  I used the word \\"overblown\\" and meant it in a good way!  This band was excellent in the early to mid 70's, and I don't consider the exaggerated musical ideas a bad thing, in this case.  <br /> <br />One thing I think is extremely special about this album is how the entire thing does a wonderful job putting pictures in your head.  It succeeds BIG time doing that.  For me, those pictures are of exploring the universe.  I was always fascinated with the planets in our solar system, and watching the moon in the sky and all the stars twinkling out there, ever since I was a child.  Also, I enjoyed thinking about what it would be like if human life was able to exist on places other than Earth.  <br /> <br />I used to love going home from school and begging my mom to take me to the library, in the hope that they added more books about the universe.  Boy that MUST have been years ago.  I began to hate school when 7th grade rolled around.  But all the mysteries of the things that might be out there in the universe really are fascinating, and good music can help make the images and thoughts in my head more rewarding.  <br /> <br />As a child, I also used to love thinking about what it would be like to discover things that other humans haven't discovered yet.  Just the thought of being on another planet and looking under rocks and finding life, or looking at craters and jumping around in them, or the idea of having an entire planet to myself!  These are some of the thoughts that kept my mind occupied as a child.  And you know, I'm not ashamed to say I still think about these things today, though not as often, since as an adult you have other, more realistic things to think about.  Don't worry, I don't do drugs or drink any kind of beer or alcohol- I just like music that allows me to think.  <br /> <br />I don't know if I'd call myself a Yes fan but I'm certainly a fan of this album, and I can say with complete certainty that I've never heard anything like this before.  This album has been waiting for me since I was 8 years old and I just didn't know it, and now at the age of 25, I'm finally hearing it (well, I downloaded it two years ago and heard it then, but I wasn't fascinated with it like I am now).  Hearing the album on compact disc is the correct way to listen to it.  <br /> <br />I also should state that I don't consider the music on this album, or the music on ANY album, to hold the answer to life's greatest mysteries.  I don't know what happens when I die, so my enthusiasm for this album is based on the music and the images it puts in my head (and childhood memories).  I don't consider Yes musical Gods, or whatever.  Just a talented band with their very own sound.  I don't think anyone can dispute that.  <br /> <br />What you have on Tales from Topographic Oceans is a grand total of four songs.  Probably thinking it must be a short album, huh?  Nope.  Each of the four songs is nearly 20 minutes in length, and each song is filled with some of the most fascinating far-out space rock psychedelic WEIRDNESS ever put on tape.  It's important to note that what may appear as noise at first, will turn into many many rewarding musical ideas over time. Remember this, if you happen to have trouble getting into it.  <br /> <br />I think these guys do a slightly better job of the \\"picturing yourself traveling through outer space\\" thing than Pink Floyd.  Then again, Floyd is more about drifting gently through space and admiring the beauty of the planets below, whereas the music of Yes can be known as \\"observing and studying the planet landscapes\\".  <br /> <br />I really don't know which of the four songs I like the most.  By the way, doesn't it suck how this album is 81 minutes long?  That means it's a double album.   If it was only a couple minutes shorter it would have fit on a single CD.  They probably could have shortened a couple minutes somewhere and I wouldn't even have noticed (but I bet hardcore Yes fans would have picked up on that and would have immediately came here to mention it, hehe). I guess it's not a big deal.  I'm just a picky guy when it comes to these things.  <br /> <br />The always-interesting music on this double, delightful album does a fine job helping me think about something I'd like to do when the weather warms up.  That is, go to my bathroom closet, grab a towel, run to the field right next to my house, lay the towel down and lay on it, and watch the stars above while listening to this album on headphones.  I have to wear glasses now, so I better bring those, too.  I agree it's a silly thought, but as a human being I can have my fantasies no matter how silly they may be.  It would be even sillier to walk out there tonight in the freezing cold and try this experiment.  No music is worth freezing your ass off!  <br /> <br />Well, I can't continue talking about nonsense throughout my review- I have to mention the main course- the music.  Is it good?  Yes, it's better than good, it's Tony the Tiger great.  I have to worn you, though.  If you have no experience with progressive rock music or any kind of complex music, you may be in for a very difficult listen.  This is Yes taking a genre of rock as far as it can go, and some people have a problem with the complexity.  It's important that you understand \\"anything can happen at any time\\" when you listen to this album.  It's not simple verse, chorus, verse, chorus, it's more like sitting back and watching a town carnival take place and taking notice of all the activity.  If you buy this album and don't like it, it would probably be a good idea to keep it anyway.  You never know when it might finally click.  <br /> <br />I also recommend you buy it even if you AREN'T a Yes fan, because these guys are doing something special here.  Really,the only part of the album that rubs me the wrong way is right at the beginning of \\"The Revealing Science of God\\" when Jon Anderson seems to carelessly ramble what seems to be one note smashing your head for a couple minutes, but then he stops and the music changes into something much better and more noticeably, into something VERY unusual.  The album is loaded with pretty and distinct guitar playing and I like how many times the guitar twirls around, making it feel like you're doing somersaults in outer space (let me remind you, I don't do drugs!)  When Jon Anderson returns on vocals after that rough beginning, he does a pretty darn good job, and he continues to do a good job for the rest of the album.  So please don't write the album off if you can't get into the first couple minutes of track one.  One moment on the album I want to mention that really pleases me is a part a few minutes into \\"The Ancient\\".   The music temporarily switches into something weird, and it sounds like pretty ballerina music with sound effects of washing machines doing jumping jacks in the background.  In case you needed any more proof I'm a weird guy. ha! <br /> <br />Pretty much the story of this album is \\"expect the unexpected\\".  Frequent musical changes, happening nonstop, challenging your mind for pretty much the entire 81 minutes.  I hate when people say you have to be a nerd to appreciate this band, or whatever.  No.  I'm not a nerd, and I'm not a smart man by any stretch of the imagination- I just like music that challenges me and helps me think about things, and as a progressive rock album you can't get more of a challenge than this (if we ignore Van Der Graaf Generator that is!) But one thing is for sure- you don't have to smoke pot to get into this album.  You may need to have a vivid imagination, but that's all you need.  Or, if you hate the sound of the electric guitar you might hate it, but let's not be silly!  <br /> <br />I know some people can't get into Yes (like EVERYONE in my family) and I have to wonder if maybe the music is just too complex or too strange for them.  Sure, Jon Anderson's voice is an acquired taste, but this band is simply too bizarre for many people.  But I think Tales offers something different.  The music on this album flows beautifully, whereas on other Yes albums the band sometimes wanks and rambles.  I can only think of a couple moments where that happens on here, and they are over before you know it.  <br /> <br />Buy Tales from Topographic Oceans and find out what it's like to hear something truly fascinating.  <br />
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I must confess I was skeptical that this great Broadway musical could ever resonate on film, it is so powerful in the theater, I just could not see how it would translate.  This movie works, granted is is not the same as seeing it on Broadway, but it works, and it works because Director Columbus was wise enough to get most of the original cast to recreate their roles, especially important was Pascal, I just could not imagine the film without him.  I was perplexed at first at the casting of Dawson at Mimi, but she is fantastic, you really can't take your eyes off of her.  I was also pleased to see that the original Angel is in the film, he really gets the character.  If you have any interest in the Broadway musical or just enjoy some great music then I believe you will be pleased with this film version of Rent.  Oh and buy the soundtrack it is at least as good as the original Broadway soundtrack.  I wonder what Larson would have thought of this..hummmmmmmm.
0684824906|4.0|At first I was inclined to be disappointed with this book.  It is the first biography I have ever read of Abraham Lincoln and I found myself wanting more of Lincoln and less of his political associates.  But the title of the book is Team of Rivals and that after all is the focus of the book.  As it turns out I did not care about Kate Chase's personal life that much, but that is not the author's fault.  I would have loved to hear more about Lincoln as a young man, but I'm sure there are many other books whose focus is just that. <br /> <br />As the book developed we got to hear more and more of Lincoln's \\"humorous stories\\" and not just an illusion to the fact that he told them.  The more actual stories that were retold or quoted the closer I felt to Lincoln as a personality.  In my opinion this closeness seemed to be less in the first half of the book.  Yes, in a book entitled Team of Rivals it shouldn't come as a huge surprise that we are to get much background information about these rivals--Seward, Chase, Bates, Stanton and others.  But as it turns out, justified or not, many readers (not all of course) might want more of Lincoln than they got and become impatient with the biographies of each rival.   <br /> <br />I assume Lincoln scholars should greet this book as a gratifying change from the intense focus on just Lincoln as in most of his biographies.  But then again average readers such as myself (I consider myself an average reader) who come to this book wanting to know more about a fascinating man than a picture on a 5 dollar bill or a face carved into a mountain may be disappointed.  It may very well be their own fault for not taking the title seriously enough, nevertheless disappointment may still be the emotion with which they are left, something I assume the author does not want. <br /> <br />Note to MS Goodwin: I have done much more reading about the Founding Fathers era than I have the Civil War.  I was convinced that no one could change my mind that George Washington was our greatest president.  Now I am wavering.  You are from a very special place, Concord, MA where it all began. What George Washington and Abraham Lincoln had in common more than anything else in my opinion was pure integrity.  If one had a greater amount of it than the other I cannot detect it. Just as you came to know Lincoln much better than you ever thought you would, I personally would be thrilled if you should decide to live with George Washington for as much time as it would take to get to know him as well.  Then please get back to me with your decision, revised or otherwise, as to who was the greater president. <br /> <br />Thank you for a momentous and fascinating book. <br /> <br />
B000C65Z1G|4.0|I started watching THE CONSTANT GARDNER last night at 9:30 and I turned it off at 10:30 because it was becoming way too stressful.  I knew if I watched much more, I would be too upset to sleep.  After finishing the movie this afternoon, I know I made the right decision.  And thank Heaven that the lovely heroine, Tessa was murdered during the beginning of the film and we could watch her life through the back filming.  If the viewer had formed a connection with this lovely and brave activist, and then had to watch her death--well--it would have been too much to bear.    The scenery of Africa was wonderful, the people beautiful, but the images were tragic.  Watching the rebels attack the little village at the end of the film was heartbreaking and appalling because we know that is constantly happening in Africa.  We also know there are pay-offs and dishonorable things going on in Africa so companies can make a buck.  This is what makes the movie so painful to watch.  Another reason is the poignant  character portrayals by the lead actors.  Ralph Fiennes as Justin Quayle and Rachel Weisz as Tessa Quayle were absolutely incredible.    This is a film that will be with me for a long time.  I am glad I watched it but this is not a story that I could enjoy again--too heart wrenching.
B00004UEIF|5.0|I'm not an afficionado, or an expert, or a wonk.  I'm just a novice who put this album on my wish list for Christmas because I'd bought \\"Everyone Digs Bill Evans\\" on an impulse (and that was a lucky impulse!).  When I received it as a gift and put it on the CD player, I was charmed, because I didn't expect the clear, yet intimate, precise, yet romantic music that poured out.  If you're looking for music for quiet days, or if you need to gamble on buying a good gift for someone who appreciates sweet music, or if you're just feeling your way, like me, and think you'd like to have more piano jazz in your life, try this; it is rapidly becoming my favorite CD.  It's not the one you'll jump around to or get the dishes done to - - try Saxophone Colossus for that - - but it is the one you'll read a book to, and fantasize about moving to Paris.  Enjoy.
B000068TPN|2.0|<br />Overview <br /> <br />Based on the book \\"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young,\\" the movie is set in 1965 where Lt. Col Hal Moore (played by the handsome Mel Gibson) is Commander of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry during the Vietnam War. Coincidently, this was the same regiment that was led by George Armstrong Custer (of Little Big Horn fame), however, although mentioned in passing over the course of two plus hours, the writers and director failed to make the relevance of such a fact comprehensible. In fact, it's a wonder, through the mesh of body parts, explosions, shooting, and muddled dialog, that any semblance of a plot could be grasped out of this film. Can you guess where this review is headed? <br /> <br />What I Didn't Like <br /> <br />Right out of the gate, I have to say this movie was trying so hard to be the Tom Hank's heart-wrenching and often visually disturbing drama Saving Private Ryan (1998) and, good lord, it really, really wasn't. We Were Soldiers did do a decent job of displaying the brutality and viciousness of war, but it so vastly lacked the comprehension and flow of dramatic storytelling that they might as well have called the film \\"We Were Some Guys.\\" Starting from the opening credits and ending with the closing image I got the sense that the only director's instruction was \\"I want lots of running around, confusion, getting dirty, and plenty of violence.\\" No story, no content, nothing. Literally, it felt like a complete sequence of: Blood. Unintelligible dialog. Blood and body parts. More Unintelligible dialog. More blood and body parts with screaming. <br /> <br />The more I think about it, the more I realize how much I disliked We Were Soldiers. <br /> <br />Between the constant switch from the U.S. to the North Vietnamese sides of the conflict, half the time I didn't know what was going on, where the hell they were and who the hell was and wasn't dead at any given time. In fact, the character development for the men on the battlefield, other than that for Gibson, was so poor I was completely un-invested in the fate of those in moments of heroics or tragedy. Instead of reacting to the pursuing drama, my thoughts were quickly subdued with questions like \\"What was the name of that guy who was just killed and is he the same guy that was with that other guy that was trapped on that hill, wherever that was?\\"  <br /> <br />On the home front, Madeleine Stowe (Last Of The Mohicans) and Keri Russell (that chick from Felicity) play the wives of the Mel and Chris Klein (American Pie) characters, stuck on the base waiting for either the dreaded telegram or for their men to return. After a get-to-know-you get-together with the other ladies on the base, they find themselves delivering \\"I regret to inform you...\\" letters door to door like Grim Reaper Avon Ladies. Even these potentially heart-tugging events were ruined by the drone-like acting from Stowe, who's overly-abundant, collagen-injected lips achieved some Olympic-sized scene stealing, while Russell wasn`t much better, but at the very least showed some trace amount of emotion when the situation warranted.  <br /> <br />What I Did Like <br /> <br />No really, there were actually a few aspects of the film that I did like... and I did say a few. The only likable characters in this film were those played by Gibson, Kinnear, and Pepper, but for probably all the wrong reasons. As almost a matter of principal, I tend to be drawn to anyone Gibson plays, and not simply for wooed-female reasons. As one of my favorite actors, Greg Kinnear (As Good As It Gets) was also a favorite here, although his character, while heroic, was rather nondescript. As for Barry Pepper, who portrayed UPI reporter Joe Galloway, his performances in The Green Mile and that other, less generic war movie with Tom Hanks I mentioned earlier, managed to carry him to a passing grade in this one as well. In addition to the familiar characters and stars, I also appreciated the attempt, however weak and unnecessary, to show the conflict from the North Vietnamese point of view. Presenting our enemy as a husband, father, boyfriend, or brother, rather than merely an evil, gun-toting thug was a welcome break from the norm. <br /> <br />Bottom Line <br /> <br />It has all the star power and a foundation based on an intriguing piece of history to boot, but in the end this was, for all intents and purposes, a brutal as all hell war flick, with some equally brutal acting (sans Gibson), directing, and overall script. I'm usually a sucker for the \\"based on a true story\\" movies, but this was just embarrassingly bad. Not since the dreadfully pleasant Brit-inspired Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) have I wanted to returned to the video store and demand a refund. That`s not to say that We Were Soldiers isn't entirely un-rentable, but if given the choice, I would've rather picked up Saving Private Ryan again and saved myself the extra trip back to the video store.  <br /> <br />
0783229526|5.0|This is a great movie!  Terry Gilliam's adaptation of Hunter Thompson's classic account of reckless abandon in the Nevada desert is one of the best book to film transitions I've ever seen.  Gilliam's contribution to the screenplay is impressive because it accurately and consistenly reflects the tone and perspective of Thompson's classic novel.  Johnny Depp gives one of his most commanding performances of all time in portraying the role of journalist Raoul Duke.  The movie explores a number of engrossing distinctions between the ideology of the 60's and the hedonism of the 70's.  A very original and intriguing piece of cinema.
0783114893|3.0|<br />Overview  <br /> <br />The consummate 80s pretty boy C. Thomas Howell (Outsiders, Red Dawn) plays 18-year-old Jim, a wuss-wanna be type who is driving cross-country to San Diego, California hoping to get out of his apparently boring home life in Chicago. As he finds himself on the verge of falling asleep at the wheel, narrowly avoiding a head on collision in the process, Jim decides to pick up a lowly hitchhiker, John Ryder (played by Rutger Hauer of Lady Hawk fame), to keep him awake.  <br /> <br />Take note: Stupid Mistake #1.  <br /> <br />Within five minutes of this first of many rookie mistakes, Jim's crotch is suddenly introduced to the crazy hitchhiker's switchblade as Ryder teases a wide variety of mind games. Eventually noticing that the fanatical psycho's door is ajar, Jim takes a risk and kicks Ryder out of the car, but then proceeds to congratulate himself for the next 20 miles or so, rather than contact the local police.  <br /> <br />Take note: Stupid Mistake #2.  <br /> <br />The rest of the story unfolds as an intense game of cat-and-mouse, as Ryder continues to follow little Jimmy while at the same time framing him for the murders of his own road-side victims. This tale also includes an appearance by Jennifer Jason Leigh (Single White Female) as Nash, a truck stop waitress with a bad accent, who takes pity on poor and pathetic Jim. It's a move that could end up costing her far more than she bargained for.  <br /> <br />Take note: Stupid Mistake #3.  <br /> <br />What I Didn't Like  <br /> <br />Like any typical horror movie, there were plenty of \\"turn the light on, idiot\\" moments, where you fully expect the stalker to jump out the shadows, but you still flinch when he does. The problem with this movie, however, was that there were at least a hundred of these idiot moments where, instead of flinching, you find yourself wondering how Jim, with apparently only a 3rd grade education, learned how to drive, much less live to the age of 18. Here isa brief transcript of my verbal dialog while watching this movie.  <br /> <br />\\"Just run him over, Jim... Now grab the freakin' gun... Geez! Get in the car, stupid...  No, don't pull over to throw up again!... Oh my God, just DRIVE!... Why don't you CALL THE POLICE???... SHOOT HIM MORON!\\"  <br /> <br />What I Did Like  <br /> <br />Of the features that I did enjoy, most were completely unintended by the filmmakers I`m sure. First there was the \\"Stupid Mistake\\" factor, which was so frustrating and retarded, it was entertaining. Then of course the fact that Jim (Howell) was such a loser in the beginning, then developed into a loser who thought he was a total bad ass by the end, was also amusing. The movie had some rewarding generic horror aspects as well, which weren't entirely based on the bewildering dimness of the characters. You can probably thank Rutger Hauer for that, as he played an exceptional nutcase, although the purpose for his rampage was never revealed.  <br /> <br />Without giving away the ending too much, my favorite part of the movie was one of the last times Jim shot Ryder. Before the man even hit the ground, you could hear a quick fly go \\"Buzz,\\" as if somehow the sound was supposed to indicate that the man was dead. Maybe it was just a weird error in editing, I don't know, but it was still pretty damn funny either way.  <br /> <br />Bottom Line  <br /> <br />Having driven the 12-plus hours between Seattle, Washington and Calgary, Alberta over a dozen times, I've never once picked up, or even considered picking up a hitchhiker. It's a strict policy of mine. After seeing this movie, however, should the opportunity present itself, I may make an exception if I ever find C. Thomas Howell hitchhiking at the side of the road, if for no other reason than to psychologically torture him for being such an idiot in this movie.  <br />
B00003CXBH|5.0|THE MISSION is a monumentally tragic film that chronicles a series of true events that occurred in the countries and confines of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil in 1750.  It involves the enslavement of a group of Native Peoples called the Guarani, who were forced into a submissive lifestyle by the Portugese and the Spaniards.  The film also documents the Christian missions that were established as a refuge for the Guarani.  Jeremy Irons is extraordinary in portraying the role of Jesuit Priest Fr. Gabriel, who erects San Carlos, a mission set above a mighty set of waterfalls for the Guarani.  Robert De Niro, in one of his most underappreciated and magnificent roles of all time, depicts the role of Rodrigo Mendoza.  Mendoza is a slave trader and mercenary, who eventually overcomes his own greed and cruelty after committing a heinous crime against a member of his own family.  Both actors are simply superb and captivating in their roles!  The film is also accompanied by breathtaking cinematography and crafty direction from British filmmaker Roland Joffe.  I musn't also forget to mention the music in this film, which is absolutley and unforgettably remarkable.  Ennio Morricone orchestrated, composed, and conducted the music for The Mission, a haunting and inspirational charged combination of classical instuments and beautiful choir-like vocalizations.  I think Morricone is one of the greatest music composers of all time and the soundtrack he's created for this film is really greater than almost anything I've ever heard!  Even if people remember nothing about this film a month after viewing it,  they would probably immediately recognize it's music if they were to hear it.  Music is a very important theme in this movie, which was eloquently illustrated towards the film's onset, when Fr. Gabriel was playing the flute on the environs of the San Carlos Mission he later established.  Initially, his presence threatened the Guarani, but after playing the flute they became entranced by it's hypnotic melodies.  Music is also eloquently used towards the end of the film in a tragic scene where Mendoza and a young Guarani child are shot by European soldiers.  Shortly thereafter, a violin can be seen floating down the river, exemplifying the civilized, yet selfless pursuit of human existence Fr. Gabriel envisioned for the mission.  At the end of the film, we are reminded of a prophetic and inspirational quote from the Bible; \\"The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.\\"
B000BT97AO|4.0|I was really excited to see this film, because I am a fan of everything Gaiman writes.  However, I have mixed reviews on the movie.  Though everyone compares this movie to the Labirynth, I think that it is more like Alice in Wonderland and the french film Amalie.  I also don't believe that this is really a film for children - maybe young adults at best.  I was down right scared at sometimes (the human cat scenes - freaked me out!)  If you have read Neil Gaiman, this film feels a lot like his equally disturbing but devourable book Coraline (also aimed at \\"kids.\\")  My major complaint with the movie was it seemed to bottom out in the middle of the movie, with the plot moving so slow that it didn't seem to be going anywhere.  Thankfully, it moved past that and tied up nicely, so nicely, that I am considering buying it.  (I rarely buy movies, there are too few original ideas.)  My best guess is that this film is an \\"aquired taste\\" and those who don't like their stories erie, unworldly and spellbinding better take a pass on this one.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I never was a Green Day fan until American Idiot.  There are so many fantastic songs on this CD.  My favorites are Extraordinary Girl, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Wake Me Up When September Ends, Holiday, and Give Me Novocaine.  Now I am listening to their earlier CD's.
0156027321|2.0|Read the book out of curiosity after hearing a small part of it over the radio. Bad choice. I did not find any of the depth or interesting parts that others have. To me this was just a long-winded fairy tale by an observant young man. What was truly dissappointing is the failure to fulfill the promise at the begining of the book, that promised a story that would make everyone beleive that there is a God. In fact, I think the book is a truly good example of how man can go on despite of extreme hardships, relying on his own sense of purpose. Pi (the main charcter in the book), despite being a christian, a muslim and a hindu at the same time, makes it through his ordeals alone. Yes, he prays three times a day, but he survives because of his own resilience. To me this book is truly a good example of how man does not need God to survive. <br /> <br />The only thing that was worthwhile in the book is the concept of being able to practice three religions at once, since they all look to serve the same supernatural being.  <br /> <br />Otherwise it was a waste of time (although I do know now, that tiger dung is not nutritious, even if you are starving)
0440416027|4.0|\\"He was filthy and pale and dried out and I thought he was dead.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  I'd soon begin to see the truth about him, that there'd never been another creature like him in the world.\\"   <br />Sometime in the mid 20th century in England, Michael, his parents, and extremely ill baby sister had just moved into a rundown old house that had a dilapidated garage filled with dead bluebottles, cobwebs, and dust.  It was there, between the tea chests lying in the corner that he discovered \\"him\\", Skellig.  Michael and his new, wise friend Mina seek to find the truth behind this mysterious creature believing that he can help the baby.  The book leaves you wondering what sort of magical being Skellig is.  Is he a man, owl, or angel? With faith, friendship, and hope you will go on a wild adventure in this thought provoking fantasy to discover the healing power of love. <br /> Skellig is an extremely unique, thoughtful read.  It is filled with deep, out of the box concepts that you don't find very often.  I wouldn't recommend this book to a large portion of readers, rather young teens who are very imaginative and like books that allow them to fill in the holes.  I felt in some parts that the strangeness was a bit too much for my liking.  Even though there isn't a whole lot going on, I found myself turning the pages.  This wasn't so much so see what happened next, but because the story flowed very well.  The story is written in first person, which I haven't been exposed to a lot.  I enjoyed always being away of what Michael was feeling and thinking.  David Almond writes very descriptively creating a delighting read (ex. \\"Outside, night had almost given way to day.  The blackbird was on the garage roof, belting out its song.  Black and pink and blue were mingling in the sky.\\").  Normally when I read a book, I can read the same line twice and still not know what I just read.  With Skellig however, I was able to read and read and understand ever bit of it.  This book has enough spice and description to it captivate your attention so you are easily able to comprehend the text.  Overall, I thought it was a good book.  It was well written, interesting, and unique.   <br />
076790592X|3.0|This book is uses the story of a great man and educator to more or less give a facelift to a 2000 year old work by Seneca (see \\"On the Shortness of Life\\").  Albom makes himself feel good with this book, critics here make themselves feel good by offering it 5 stars, while Morrie lies near the pond wondering why more people don't read the likes of Seneca, as he obviously did.  <br /> <br /> <br />

B00005JOFO|5.0|This is a film for open-minded audiences. Bigots and their ilk should stay away from it. I consider myself lucky to live in a time when there are people like Ang Lee who have the courage and talent to create such a wonderful and timeless masterpiece. Weeks after seeing it, this film is still haunting me and will continue to do so for as long as I live. Thanks to all involved!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|If you are looking for a different kind of soap then Everwood is the one for you . <br />A family move from New York to the middle of nowhere because of a promise. <br />It has love hate relationships and like every soap.........will the boy ever get together with the girl , or is she just using him ? <br />The father is just a little too good to be beleived but fits snugly into the story line. <br />His youngest daughter is just fantastic, her reasoning seems to sort everyone out. <br />Something for all the family. <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|When I first heard that a movie based on FFVII was being made, I almost cried. We all know that those USUALLY don.t turn out well... <br /> <br />I ALMOST cried...instead, I decided to give it a shot and get the Japanese version. Didn.t understand a damn thing they said until I found subtitles, but even then, the movie was just so PRETTY I couldn.t help but allow my jaw to make permanent residence on the floor. The movie just doesn.t get boring at all. Everyone I know that has seen it has been astounded by it. Some didn.t even play the game.! Some weren.t even gamers.! <br /> <br />I think this does the Final Fantasy VII franchise proud. When it.s released in the U.S I will definitely be getting a copy. Give it a try. Definitely worth the money.  <br /> <br />Oh, and for those that saw The Spirits Within and want to know if it will be anything like that...no. Spirits Within was a good movie, but very slow to progress. Advent Children kind of deals hit after hit.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is a must for all Stones fans ad a must for all people who have good taste in music. As awlays we have the Stones's classic orchestral sound throughout the album along with Keith's amazing guitar work. Not only is this the Stones's best album, but it's one of the best records ever made. It stands as tall as Beggers Banquet and Stick Fingers, and even a little higher. My favorites are Tumbling Dice, Rip This Joint, Ventilator Blues, and Sweet Virginia(really overlooked)! Get this album as fast as you can. Get their other classics as well. If you love classic rock and all that it encompasses, you owe it to yourself to get this amazing album.
0783232039|2.0|OK, I'm a Chucky fan and have really enjoyed the Child's Play movies up until this one. When Chucky's old flame Tiffany ( Jennifer Tilly ) sews Chucky back together and performs the voodoo chant over Chucky's body, Chucky is brought back to life. Not wanting to be the only one stuck in a doll's body, Chucky turns Tiffany into a killer doll just like him. The two of them then find themselves in the back of a vehicle of a young couple in love who plan on getting married. Then, Chucky and Tiffany get married. Together, they form a killer doll duo. This movie has very stupid scenes and is just plain silly. There are a couple of cool death scenes but overall, I think we could have done without Bride Of Chucky. So, for true horror fans, you will be disappointed because this movie is as much comedy as it is \\"horror\\".
B00000612Q|5.0|<br />Back in the day, Rod Stewart was, quite simply, the best rock singer in the world.  If that sounds like a grand claim, pick up this CD and listen.  Case closed.  A lot of younger people listening to Rod's most recent output must wonder why he was once so revered.  I'd say the first 20 seconds of this album would be a pretty good clue.  As Rod rips into \\"True Blue\\", it's the start of a powerhouse album of great rock singing.  Essential from start to finish.  \\"You Wear It Well\\" may have been the (deservedly) big hit here, but the rest of the material is outstanding.  <br /> <br />Of course, nobody would have noticed if the material and the support from the band weren't consistently excellent.  They are.  This album is astonishingly good from start to finish.  The only song that didn't grab me from the start was the cover of Sam Cooke's \\"Twistin' the Night Away\\", played quite slower than the original.  Now I realize it was just that this song about twisting was reinterpreted as a hard rock song.  Not really twistable, but darned good nevertheless.   <br /> <br />Arguments about whether this or \\"Every Picture Tells A Story\\" are Rod's best album are irrelevant.  If you're a serious fan of Rock music and you don't own both, you're doing yourself a diservice.
0767817486|5.0|Riviting and a show of hostility towards Americans in particular and humans in general this is the film to show overseas travelers what it means to illegally transport the well known secret that is: Dont mess with the governments flow of revenue YOU WILL BE PUNISHED!!<br /><br />Whatever liberties the makers of the film may have taken cannot compare with the liberties that was taken by the Turkish government.<br /><br />Pontificating any further would merely be trying to show how smart I am.<br /><br />Watch this film.........................LOUDLY

B0007PALSE|2.0|Will Smith earned $28 million for doing this film, and the budget was probably on a similar astronomical scale! Most of the budget was obviously blown on the CGI and miniatures effects. Most of the CGI is quite impressive, although very occasionally the back projection does look a bit iffy, but it only lasts a couple of seconds at most.<br /><br />I, Robot is set in 2035, and most of the futuristic elements are subtle rather than the in-your-face ones say for example from Demolition Man or Back To The Future II. Apart from the severely high rise buildings, there's also spherical wheels on the vehicles (which meant they could go in any direction), more of the self-drive, and the car doors swinging upwards a la Delorean. The production designers and conceptual artists had a great time imagining a progression of today's world.<br /><br />When I think of robots, for some reason I now automatically think of Bicentennial Man, rather than the robot design in this. They're not very friendly looking, but I suppose Alex Proyas wanted to put his own stamp on the robot design, rather than follow in the generic type featured in some other films.  Maybe he wanted the robots to look vaguely humanoid but still obviously robotic, rather than the cyborg type.<br /><br />I always find with Will Smith that he quite often does play the same character, much like the way Tom Cruise is getting. He's still got elements of Fresh Prince about his character, despite being over a decade on from that now, and with a lot more muscles. He's nearly always the funny guy, with the one-liners. He's always been good at the action side of things, all 6ft 2 of him (which he's been since he was 13!), but there's still the funny guy waiting to burst out with a hilarious one liner that will have everyone rolling in the aisles. For all the ladies out there, we get to see Big Will himself in the shower, in profile. The film is worth the price just for that scene alone. And the two scenes where he gets out of bed in boxers. Unless you're a heterosexual guy.<br /><br />For me, I wasn't overly keen on this film. It wasn't a really, really, good film, but on the other hand it wasn't a really, really bad film. It was kinda stuck in the middle, but not in a good way. Not to be sexist, but apart from the scenes in the shower, it was more a guy's kinda film. There were some scenes glossed over, like the story of how Will's character came to be partially cybernetic, which led me to believe that he was a robot, Terminator-esque. He wasn't.<br /><br />The two disc special edition which was released in the UK has a multitude of extras on it, including commentaries (does anyone ever bother with these?); a 44 minute making of documentary; extensive production diaries; CGI effects breakdowns etc. They were reasonably good, if you're into that sort of thing, but I'm finding I watch extras on the DVD less & less now, only if it's a blooper reel, or a film I really, really like.<br /><br />Overall, a film that could have been better, and could have been worse. And I'd like an order of Will Smith in the shower on the side with that. From now on, lets just have all Will Smith films featuring him in the shower.you're a heterosexual guy.

B00005LK95|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies when I was six years old. I am no longer six years old, but I still find the use of Bonnie Tyler's \\"Holding out for a Hero\\" bittersweet and inspiring.  This movie features Ben Jharvi, a loveable indian main character, who is in reality not indian at all but a jewish man named Fisher Stevens covered in brown shoe polish. Had I known this as a child I would have liked it nonetheless, although I probably would have found it slightly offensive.  FIVE STARS.
B000002L75|4.0|This is the first Depeche Mode album I listened to and that was 20 years ago and I still love it.  This is early Depeche Mode and when you listen to them from now versus then, you will hear they only got better.  \\"Somebody\\" and \\"Lie to Me\\" are my favorite songs.  The lyrics are fantastic.  If you enjoy Depeche Mode now and love their sound you will like this album.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This film interested me in the first place because of Johnny Depp. He had been amazing in Pirates of the Caribbean and I wanted to see what he was doing in a Peter Pan movie. I was hooked right away when I saw his head poking out of the curtains at the beginning; good old comic Johnny. I loved his Scottish accent, and when he was playing with the children you heard his Captain Jack voice again. His connection with the kids, Sylvia, and especially us, the audience, is so strong that when she sees Neverland you just want to step right in yourself. It was like a dream; I had to watch it a second time to make sure it wasn't. The word that comes to mind is 'imagine'. He never stopped dreaming, and that was why he succeeded. If you can imagine it, it can happen.
B0002858YS|4.0|The thing about the Killers is this. They obviously have everything it takes to be one of the greatest dance rock bands ever. Brandon Flowers' catchy yet deep voice is great for setting the tune, meanwhile the rest of the band create some of the best dance tunes any of us have heard for a while. If they could only just follow through with these talents, they would be insanely good. <br /> <br />\\"Jenny Was A Friend of Mine\\" is a great intro. Flower's drone of a voice opens it up, and while it isn't the dance music that the album progresses into, it somehow fits perfectly. \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is my hands-down favorite song. It is catchy, has pretty good lyrics, and a kickass chorus. You only have to hear this song once to find yourself completely obsessed with it. \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" is a slow, kind of catchy, song with a couple of awesome sets of lyrics. \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is another favorite on this album. As their well-chosen first single, they quickly established themselves as one of the best dance rockers that came out of that whole rock revival craze. Its tune is infectious, the beat is awesome, and at least your shoulders will get some movement.  <br /> <br />\\"All These Things That I Have Done\\" is one of my favorite sing a long songs ever. It is a kind of slow but extremely catchy song, and near the end they go on for a bit in a multi-person chant of \\"I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier.\\" Many a drunken night have been spent singing this song with my friends. ;). \\"Andy You're a Star\\" will seem kind of boring at first, but strangely you will find yourself singing it for days and keep coming back for more. <br /> <br />And as much as i hate to do this, the rest of the songs really aren't worth reviewing. I usually hate when people cop out and do this, but the rest of the album really is that boring and unmemorable. They are slow and droning, not exactly the Killers' strongpoint. I didn't find anything lyrically striking. And by the end you are just praying that it is the last song. So my review ends with this, listen to the first 6 songs and see how amazing this band really can be. Don't bother with the last 5 songs, because they will only ruin your outlook on the band. I am pulling for a VERY strong sophomore album, hopefully more heavily focused on the dance songs than this album. Also, the obvious comparison is Franz Ferdinand. If you like this band check them out. And if you like both bands, also check out Arctic Monkeys. You won't be disappointed
0307276902|4.0|I read this book before the \\"Smoking Gun\\" review. I found it difficult to put down. Interestingly written in the stream of consciousness format, you felt as though you were literally in his head at times, experiencing his his every thought. At times I questioned some of the situations and felt as though perhaps inside the alcoholic/drug addict/criminal mind there were a few distorted memories. If you read it as fiction, it's a darned good insight into the addict's mind. The one thing that bothered me was the total unacceptance of a \\"higher power\\". It left me feeling that he was finally going to have an epiphany, yet it never came.
0312955006|3.0|Harry is on trial for the shooting death of the serial killer known as the Dollmaker.  After eleven victims, a twelfth turns up-a blonde buried in the concrete.  After a mysterious note from the Dollmaker arrives for Harry, he begins to doubt whether he shot the right person.  This was an ingeniously crafted tale about a serial killer.  My only problem is Connelly's choice of who the murderer is at the end of the book.  Harry's love interest is pretty boring too.
0316666343|3.0|I found this book to be lacking in the author's description of Susie Salmon's heaven. I think Sebold could have developed the child's perception of heaven a bit more, and ironically her description lacked any mention of God. It reminded me loosely of \\"Five People you meet in Heaven\\". A quick read. Thought provoking. Good book for high school reading.
0812550706|5.0|This is an intense, but excellent book about a boy who must quickly grow into a man.  Ender Wiggin is an intelligent boy of six when he is drafted into Battle School, destined to become the Commander who will save all of humanity.  After two Bugger invasions, humanity's last hope is a young genius, who can command the fleet to victory.  Ender is tested and tested, alienated by adults, despised older boys, but determined to win.  Leaving his cruel brother, Peter, and loving sister, he rises up the ranks until he is the commander of his own army.  He wins all the games and then gets promoted to Command School.  This book is hard to put down.  It is one of the most psychologically thrilling books I've ever read.  I didn't want it to end, but I was just emotionally drained as Ender at the end.  How can the sequel be better than this?
B00007E8O5|4.0|<br />In order to fully appreciate this album, you need to have an undying love for Alice In Chains and Layne Staley, yet being realistic and accepting the fact that they are gone. Then Jerry Cantrell will revive those old memories of that very excellent band that died way too soon, and never earned the acclaim they deserved. <br /> <br />As I said earlier, this is not Alice In Chains, do not expect it to be. This is Jerry Cantrell. Cantrell was the driving force behind AIC songs like Heaven Beside You, Rooster, Over Now, Got Me Wrong, and Brother. Whereas Layne Staley was the creator of Them Bones, Dirt, Sludge Factory, Man In the Box, Angry Chair and Would?. See the difference? <br /> <br />This album is a portrait of a man \\"after-the fact\\". Jerry Cantrell brilliantly captures the life of a guy that is living after the glory has left. The fame is gone, the spotlight is no longer focused on Seattle, and the party is over. Yet, he returns to what brought him to those high-water marks before: the music.  <br /> <br />I was pleased with this album because the songs Jerry wrote with AIC and on \\"Boggy Depot\\" were very run-of-the-mill and lacked emotion. Not this one. Not \\"Degradation Trip\\". Jerry finally breaks out of his shell and tells stories that he can relate to, the things that drive him and provide him with his motivation. Do not buy this hoping to hear about the chaos that comes from a destructive, intense heroin addiction. Instead, you will get the sympathy and sorrow Jerry feels for his fallen friend, Layne Staley.   <br /> <br />If you are a die hard Alice In Chains fan, you will really grow to appreciate this very much. Metal fans needing their fix for ass-kicking rock should not look to \\"Degradation Trip\\" to save the day.  <br /> <br />You would have to be a relentless AIC fan who knows alot about the band and what really went down to love this. And trust me, you will. You will love this. You will love the regrets and sympathy Jerry feels for Layne, you will love the picture Jerry paints of just how great things were when they were on top of the world, and you will love the music that Jerry made that documents the descent from fame and grandeur. <br /> <br />It is very solid. It shows just how talented Jerry Cantrell really is. Layne Staley, rest in peace. But Jerry Cantrell, rock on brother!
0515125024|4.0|This was a very good sequel to the first Jack Reacher novel.  Here, Reacher gets kidnapped along with an attractive FBI agent.  The kidnappers drive cross-country until they reach Montana, where a secret militia has gathered.  The FBI agent is the key to their plan, since her father is the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and her godfather is the President.  This was a good thriller.  The writing is intense but fluid.
B000AYEI5Y|1.0|I would give this album zero stars if I could because: <br />a) James Blunt is marketed as a songwriter and he is not - out of the 10 songs he only wrote one song himself.  What's worse is that he - or the record company - have gone to great pains to cover this up.  According to the place where most people will look to see who wrote the songs - ie under the track title and above the lyrics - it says he co-wrote 6 of the songs, and he is credited as writing tracks 4, 9 and 10 with 'additional music' by someone else - they are credited as being by 'Blunt (with additional music by Skarbek)' but on the last panel of the CD, in small type, it says tracks 4, 9 and 10 written by J. Blunt and S. Skarbek.  Do the math - that means he wrote a total of one song out of 10 unassisted.  I guess it must be hard to market someone as a songwriter if they didn't actually write all - or even most of the songs on the album.  Writing only one whole song unassisted out of 10 - that's pretty poor going for a 'songwriter'. <br />b) it's only got one good song - 'You're Beautiful'.  And no, that's not the one that James wrote himself.  Buy it on iTunes and save yourself the waste of the rest of the CD. <br />c) the album is covered in shameless direct plagiarism - for example the lick from The Doors 'Riders On The Storm' stolen for 'So Long Jimmy' - ok, so it's about Jim Morrison, but Mr Blunt can't you write your own lick?  Also did you have to steal the opening chords from Kate Bush's 'Hammer Horror' for the song 'No Bravery'.  Or maybe that was your co-writers? <br /> <br />In summary, this album is not very good, and is fraudulently marketed.

B000063TDY|4.0|This is a Saxon album that is often forgotten and will often stay in the shadow of such classics as Strong Arm of the Law, Denim and Leather and Wheels of Steel.  Although this release doesen't have the same \\"metal cult status\\" as the previous albums mentioned, it is a very strong showing from Biff and the lads.<br /><br />No one enjoying early Saxon will be dissapointed by this one. Definately a \\"safe buy\\".
0425173895|4.0|Told from the perspective of village doctor, Dr. Sheppard, this mystery has one of the best, most surprising endings.  King's Abbot is a quiet village until the elderly Mrs. Ferrar's takes her own life.  Her devout friend, Mr. Ackroyd, receives a letter from her explaining that someone has been blackmailing her.  Then after the Dr. Sheppard's visit to Ackroyd's mansion, the doctor gets a phone call telling him that Mr. Ackroyd's been murdered in his study.  This is the classic, closed-room who-dunnit, with a cast of characters who all have something to hide.  By coincidence, living in King's Aboot is the retired, world famous, detective Hercule Poirot, who is asked to solve the murder.  Everyone is suspect.  Only Poirot, with his little gray cells, is able to deduce what happened.  Dr. Sheppard plays Dr. Watson to his Holmes and writes about their exploits.  Brilliant!!!
B000035P7X|5.0|The documentary \\"Don't Look Back\\" is an interesting perspective into the historical visit of Bob Dylan in the country of England. The time is 1965, and D.A. Pennebaker, the man behind the camera, portrays a very whitty, intelligent Dylan, as he faces the media of the time, as well as the English audience. Dylan is brilliant both in front of the audience, as well as back stage amongst his comrades. He is the star, and he is the jester at the same time. I recommend this for everyone.
0312958455|4.0|Harry is on suspension for hitting his commanding officer.  Part of the suspension includes seeing a psychologist.  Less than thrilled Harry participates reluctantly but begins to understand why he's been so angry lately.  He has a job that he's been putting off.  He must find out who murdered his mother, a prostitute.  This book really gets inside Harry's head like no other.  We understand who he is and what makes him tick.  He discovers his mother's murder may have been swept under the rug by the politics of the 1950s, involving an aspiring attorney general and his lackeys.  While the pace is a bit slow, the investigation and end is truly thrilling.
B000002LEU|5.0|I recommend that to especially beginners and maybe to fans of Joy Division too. from the classical hit 'Love will tear us apart' to not so known 'Novelty', 'These days' etc are all gathered in this album. And if you want to get the essence of Joy Division, I say start with 'Atmosphere'or 'Isolation'.    by the way if you are new to Joy Division I have a note; the music they make is NOT a background music, you should be all focused on the music of Joy Division as it is the subject itself. you can be irritated or dragged into it or whatever but it would always make you feel something...

Honest.\\" -Charlie <br /> Written by Stephen Chbosky, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the most wonderful, daring, extravagant, controversial, and realistic books I've ever read.  Written in journal format, it is a diary that Charlie sends in letters, but yet the recipient is never revealed. <br /> Charlie has just lost his best friend to `problems at home'.  He starts his freshman year of high-school with no friends and no confidence.  His brother is hitting the big time at Penn State and his sister is a senior.  He really doesn't mind not having friends...until, he meets the best he's ever had. <br /> Sam and Patrick, who are step-brother and sister, welcome Charlie into their group of friends.  Charlie, being the wallflower he is, listens and tries to please everyone.  They introduce him to the crazy Friday nights of Rocky Horror Picture Show. <br />Charlie is one of the most talented individuals of his age, according to his English teacher, who gives him `special' assignments, but even though Charlie is smart, you can tell his mental state is disturbed.   <br />Chbosky does a magnificent job of making you fall in love with his characters.  I feel like I've gotten the best letters that have ever been sent to me.  The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a book that I won't soon forget, and will cherish in my memory. <br />The most fun I have ever had reading was spent following Charlie through his rollercoaster of freshman year.  From LSD, to Marijuana, to special brownies, Charlie learns more and more about himself and what he cares about most, feeling infinite <br />

0764574124|5.0|The author of this book states that is very difficult to learn the concepts being presented unless you have an application you are going develop. Coming at it from the other end, having the need to develop an application I found this book to be extremely helpful. Using only this book and the Microsoft help system I was able to create what would be called a fairly complex Excel VBA solution.<br /><br />While working on my project I bought some other books because I thought they would be needed. They have been collecting dust. If you are a beginner to programming I would highly recommend this book because the basic principles are presented in such a way to give a good foundation for building upon the more complex ones needed to go forward. At least that is what I got from using this book, and this book now looks very used.
B000000OR9|5.0|What an album! If you're into guitar driven rock/metal this album must surely rate in the top 10 of any collection. Dubbed a cult classic by many, this is an intense collection of songs by the main man - John Sykes! He was clearly in a purple patch of creativity around the time of writing this stuff. The end result is an album that will remain a legend forever!
B000BYA5G4|3.0|There are some features to like about this movie. We follow the career of a gun-runner as he progresses from local firearm supplier for street gangs to very successful and amoral international armorer for various 3rd-world despots and revolutionaries.  The film does a good job of driving home the carnage wrought by his customers and the bleak existence of the population. <br /> <br />The disappointing thing about this movie is that it can't resist preaching (literally, impassioned speeches in the final reel)  although you would have to be napping through the 1st 2/3 of the film to miss its viewpoint. Yes, we know the U.S. is a major arms supplier. Yes, we know the non-stop revolutions and civil wars in the 3rd world bring untold misery, and no, we doubt that private arms dealers are the major source of the problem, any more than fast food outlets are the major reason for obesity.

After seeing Walk the Line recently I needed to hear what he was really saying in his music. This CD has opened up my perception of both the man and his music. It is fun and from what I can tell has a great mix of his songs that I have been enjoying since cracking open the seal! You don't have to be a country fan or in fact any kind of fan other than a music fan to enjoy this one!

1891252089|5.0|This book is a fantastic guide for your Ashtanga Yoga. I would recommend reading Yoga Mala (Pattabhi Jois) first, and then using this book as a guide for your practice. Illustrations are clear, vivid and easy to follow. The binding of the book allows for propping while praticing. David Swenson does a fantastic walking through step by step how to get into each pose. I use it everyday!
0062502182|5.0|This is a timeless masterpiece for those who seek true freedom and who desire to express their full potential. Actually, one must have been touched by an act of Grace when one comes across this book and recognizes its value. No wonder it has been on top of bestselling lists in many countries. Coelho certainly deserves his dreams and fame. From my point of view, most disagreements with him come not from the timeless truths he states in the book, but rather from his background or religious education. Some contemporary writers or readers might dislike his idea of having one's destiny written in advance. But this is, in fact, not essential. Coelho explains clearly how we are responsable for our own choices, especially in his other works such as \\"The Fifth Mountain,\\" \\"Myss Pilgrim,\\" \\"Manual for the Warrior of the Light.\\" I guess \\"The Alchemist\\" and \\"Warrior of the Light\\" contribute significantly to the spiritual evolution and phenomenal achievements of Story Waters. These books certainly have greatly shaped my evolution. I would like to take this occasion to express my gratitude to Coelho for having so eloquently conveyed God's words to me.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was skeptical at first.  I must admit that i was also very excited to see this movie.  Pride and Prejudice is my favourite book ever!  I also consider myself a purist when it comes to book adaptations on film.   <br /> <br />After I left the movie theater I felt I was like in a trance.  I felt so happy.  Eventually I saw the movie 6 times in theater!!!!   <br /> <br />I really loved this movie.  It bewitched me body and soul and I love and love and love it!  And, even though I love Colin Firth, Matthew Macfadyen is so hot!!!! OMG.  I fell for him from the first moment he appeared at the Meryton townhall.  <br /> <br />I recommend this movie to all fans of Pride and Prejudice
0920668372|1.0|Words cannot describe the chills of revulsion as I truned to the page where the mom creeps across the bedroom floor to her sleeping son so she can take him out of his bed an rock him.  That was bad enough; but when she drives across town in the middle of the night with a ladder strapped to the car roof so she can climb into her adult (?) son's bedroom and rock him again in his sleep (?!?) - that nearly sent me wretching to the toilet. <br /> <br />Does Mr. Munsch's mom keep his \\"jewels\\" in a little amulet around her neck ? <br /> <br />Who are the deranged people who gave this thing a positive rating ? <br />Are they still reproducing ?

B000002AZ8|4.0|Let me recap something: Pearl Jam came from the early nineties. They figure in the proverbial \\"Big 4\\" of the Grunge movement right alongside Nirvana, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains. If anybody said that frontman Eddie Vedder has a somewhat disturbed mind, they wouldn't be all wrong. <br /> <br />And if ANY band decided to release a musical oddity for all their fans out there... well, (unfortunately) they can. <br /> <br />I have never heard a Pearl Jam album before. I actually picked up \\"Vitalogy\\" on impulse, just for the sake of sampling their music. Obviously I could've done better with their more established albums (\\"Ten\\" or \\"Vs.\\") or even their hits album \\"rearviewmirror\\". But \\"Vitalogy\\" can be a good choice of album if you feel like scrambling your ears every now and then, which I think every CD beginner should do to make their musical experience more interesting. <br /> <br />\\"Vitalogy\\" is easily one of the weirdest albums I've ever heard. If you're unfamiliar with Pearl Jam then some of the songs, which even fans found too weird, can really be an unpleasant shock. One thing you can do to ease your listening to this CD is take the songs \\"Pry, to\\" (just Vedder spelling \\"Privacy\\" over and over again\\") and \\"Bugs\\" (A diatribe with accordion accompaniment) as artistic gags more than anything else. <br /> <br />Weirder than the album itself is the packaging, inspired by a real health book Vedder found in a garage sale. Don't even bother figuring out what era in history the \\"book\\" dates from. <br /> <br />However the (real) music was done fairly well. \\"Spin the Black Circle\\", \\"Whipping\\" and \\"Satan's Bed\\" are good hardcore songs. The opening tracks \\"Last Exit\\" and \\"Not for You\\" won't sound too horrible if you heard them over the radio. And the songs \\"Immortality\\", \\"Nothingman\\" and \\"Better Man\\" sound subtly terrific. <br /> <br />The songs that stood out most for me were \\"Tremor Christ\\", \\"Corduroy\\", \\"Better Man\\", \\"Nothingman\\", \\"Immortality\\" and (strangely) \\"Pry, To\\".Much of the album seems to deal with this odd detachment between the songs' lyrics and melodies, but in all \\"Vitalogy\\" is not a completely wasted effort at all.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|In most American geek movies, the characters and we the audience are expected to accept that the characters are geeks and/or social rejects. In this movie that is not true. The characters do not believe there is anything wrong with them, and there really isn't anything wrong with them. The reason they are not suffering about their lot in life or their social position is because they don't think there is anything wrong with themselves, and thats true for Napoleon and the rest of the group in this picture. The beauty of this movie is that you watch it initially from the usual premise, but as it wears on you start to realize that the characters truth that they are fine as who they are is just as real as assuming otherwise.

0679745203|1.0|I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.     I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.    I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B00005JO04|3.0|This movie is perhaps a very good one, but it's difficult to show the idea from the director: there's a lot of information and it's hard to remember the facts. Great acting, great colours, smart production but...give me a break, you need a book to take notes

0743455967|3.0|The Cleveland Plain Dealer, in reviewing this book, called it \\"The best book on writing.  Ever.\\"  Whoa!  Back off a bit.  I can think of several better that I have read.  Maybe the paper meant to say, \\"The best book on writing ever written by a most prolific and best-selling author.\\"  That I'll buy.  This book is as much an autobiography as it is a treatise on how to be a successful author.  But there are few autobiographical topics or insights that haven't already been covered, for example on A&E Biography.  There are two basic lessons that Mr. King imparts to us  \\"Write a lot; read a lot.\\"  To wit, if you want to be a writer, then write; if you want to be a writer, read.  He tells us how he is never without a book at his fingertips, a book he will turn to at odd moments throughout the day.  Like when he is waiting in line at the post office or grocery checkout or doctor's office.  Or when on an airplane to keep fellow passengers from interrupting him with idle chitchat.  Worth the price of the book itself is the list he includes of approximately 100 books he most enjoyed reading over the last three or four years.  As he says, \\"I suspect each book in the list had an influence on the books I wrote.\\"  Without this list, this book would be just another trip to the bank for author King.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|Quite possibly the most overrated movie of recent times. <br /> <br />Eclectric but not useful in any way. So far fetched that it was untraceable. <br /> <br />If people believed this movie touched their hearts or some other part of their body, they may need help. <br /> <br />As one who can handle fantasy and bizarre themes, I was expecting, at least in some part, a movie that could give me something. <br /> <br />My only piece of empathy was with the son who had been lied to all through his life and could not pick fact from fiction. Everyone loves a dad who has a wild imagination and funny stories but here was a kid who still, in his 30's had never been in touch with his dad.
B0000024UX|4.0|Ok for years, (yes it's true) i haven't really liked this album. For one thing i had only heard bits and pieces, and never fully sat down, put on the headphones and just put it on. So i did that. I found it to be really good, better than i had first thought, but! but! i found it sort of...overrated. It simply isn't s and g's best, no sir. The only living boy in New York is, simply put, absolutely beautiful. It flows, and is majestic. But a live version of bye bye love is not only out of place, but truly not a good song. I found that selection of song really dissapointing. Bridge over Troubled water is of course emotional, and one of their best songs, but unfourtunately alot of s and g's previous beauty i found to be gone, mostly lost. Ok so it won some grammy's, so what? U2 won some grammy's for the least creative, most overrated album of the year. Awards mean zip. The album is just peppered with too much staleness, but thanks to 5 or 6 good songs, manages to redeem itself. The songs that lack true grit are not awful, they are still ok, and listenable, but i don't think they are superb. Check out Bookends instead.
B000002B2T|5.0|One of the most underrated and best albums to come out of the 90s. It's so sad that this was all we got, but it's good enough. Every track here is brilliant and unique, none of which have lost their edge 11 years later, and it continues to shock me how few people give it its due. Staley is as good as his best vocals with AiC (\\"Dirt\\"). This is also McCready at his absolute finest, and look for a nice appearance by Mark Lanegan. Eerie, haunting, beautiful. This is an essential album.
B00006AW2F|5.0|3 stars? 4 stars? i was a little shocked at all the negative response for this album. I'm going out on a limb here and saying that not only is this the Stones best album, that's right, but without out a doubt their most inventive, most chance taking, and most lyrically mature. I've heard sticky fingers, there are 5 good songs, and that goes for all Stones albums. They all have amazing songs, but all of them drag and drag with songs that make me think,the Stones are actually in competition with the Beatles? Heck no. The album Metamorphosis offers newness with every track, it involves huge risks, and is a vast difference from any other Stones album. It simply doesn't sound like the monotonous albums they made afterward. It truly is uderrated, and should be in every true music fans collection. Maybe i'm just crazy, i don't know. If there is any reason at all why the Stones are great it is because of an album like this.
B00004TJTS|2.0|I am not a dog-lover in any way shape or form.  Cats, in my personal opinion, are the greatest pets that anyone could have.  Their ability to be self-existent is reason enough to put them ahead of dogs any day.  So, many of you may be asking, why would I rent a film like this if I didn't like dogs?  Two reasons.  First, I am a sucker for anything known as cinema, and two, there was quite a bit of popularity surrounding this film at the time of its release.  I remember hearing that Kevin Bacon could possibly win an award for his outstanding performance in this film and that it was one of those films that will make any person with a heart break into tears.  Oh, and I guess there was a third thing ... rumor had it that Clint Howard was in My Dog Skip, and for those that know me, I cannot pass up the opportunity to see Ron Howard's little brother in action!  So, I submerged myself into this film one fateful night and watched a clich&eacute; Hollywood story with some very decent acting attempt to pull at my heartstrings and moments of nostalgia.  I must admit, some of the rumors were correct.  Bacon, as well as others did some phenomenal acting in this little film, but it was the story that ultimately disappointed me.  I needed creativity, spontaneity, and excitement, alas, all I found was a simpleton story that could easily be found in any book dealing with dogs, pre-teens, summers, and social climbing while suffering from the classic Old Yeller syndrome.<br /><br />My Dog Skip doesn't hold back in using every classic Hollywood trick in the book when building the relationship between Willie and his dog, Skip.  From the dog becoming a part of the community to eventually saving lives while teaching lessons, My Dog Skip does not promote originality at all.  You could see the director, possibly with some note cards, talking to his crew about how other Hollywood hits like Turner & Hooch, Benji, or any of the Lassie series (either television or film) did it, and he would not like to stray far from the devices that these similar films used.  Would it have harmed director Jay Russell to be original, to take a stronger stance on developing the author Willie Morris' words a bit stronger.  This could have been a sensational film about friendship during the troubled years of America (i.e. the War and apparent racism in Mississippi), but instead Russell skirted around the issues and penetrated our hearts with a cute Muniz and a dog that was prepped for the camera.  I apologize about my cynicism towards this feature, but I witnessed a lack of respect as I watched this film for both the patrons in the audience and the time it was attempting to portray.  I wanted to see more honesty behind the script, instead of clich&eacute; Hollywood moments.  Even though this was developed as a \\"children's film\\", I believe that more should have been explained about the circumstances surrounding Dink, more should have been developed about the bootleggers, and more needed to be developed about the scattered racism in town.  Russell attempted to paint this beautiful image of rural Mississippi in 1942, but it felt that instead of using paint he used candy to gloss over some of the rougher edges.  There is a point when we must realize that children can accept the facts of our nation, and that a boyhood friendship can still grow strong even during times that we are not proud of.<br /><br />What is friendship?  According to My Dog Skip, friendship is helping an insecure someone reach a better point in their life.  Friendship means always being the initiator, while ultimately realizing that this same person may never repay the favor.  Do you not agree?  These were the \\"life lessons\\" that I learned from this film.  This is another hearty mistake that I believe hurt Jay Russell's feature.  Here we have Muniz unable to cope with the social struggles of life without the help outgoing and energetic Skip.  If it weren't for this dog, Willie Morris may never had broken freeof those insecure shackles of life.  Yet, somehow, no praise is generated for this dog at the end.  Without giving anything away, the final note of this film is rather depressing, not due to the events that occur, but due to the actions of Morris.  I nearly shed a tear because I felt horrible that this dog was so exhaustingly great to this boy, yet Skip is slowly forgotten.  This is how I interpreted the final scenes, perhaps others saw it differently, but why was Willie Morris missing from the final moments?  Could someone help me?<br /><br />While I may not have great ideas to share about the plot of this film, I did think that the acting was a par above your typical \\"dog befriends boy\\" films.  Muniz does his job well considering being hired mainly for the \\"cute\\" element.  I do believe that over time Muniz looses that childish look that he could have literally patented.  He kept my eyes on the film, but it was Kevin Bacon's role that kept me glued to the screen.  Kevin Bacon continues to prove that no matter what part you give him, he will stand up and ensure that he gives his undivided attention to the character.  He will take you away from seeing Kevin Bacon on screen, and force you to see the character he is trying to create.  In this film, it is Willie's stern (yet human) father Jack Morris.  I believe an entire film could have been centered on Bacon's portrayal and possibly been better than what we witnessed here.  Diane Lane again demonstrates her ability to play the \\"every woman\\" role.  She needed to be handed more in this film to broaden her character.  Not enough meat was given to her to chomp on, which hurts one of the pivotal scenes early in the film.  Luke Wilson, well, he plays Luke Wilson.  If you have seen any of his films, than you have seen his portrayal in this feature.  He needed to reach deeper into the Born on the 4th of July moments to truly capture his character.  Dink is Luke and Luke is Dink.  Enough said.  Then, I cannot end without giving credit to Clint Howard.  He had too small of a role in this film and brought some brief moments of enjoyment to this reviewer.  Clint Howard is an undiscovered gem in Hollywood.  While his brother hogs the spotlight, Clint can honestly stand on his two feet in my book.  It was his portrayal of Millard in My Dog Skip that strengthened this mediocre film.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't like this film.  I cannot stress the fact that due to director Jay Russell's lack of ability to take risks, My Dog Skip eventually transformed into another typical \\"dog helps boy become popular\\" story.  There was no creativity or originality of the story (which in my eyes was too candy-coated even for the youngest of viewers), nor was there any respect for Skip near the end of the film.  The only plus I can give this film is for Kevin Bacon reaching higher with this small role than most actors would have.  This was one of those films where I believe the acting was directly in line for what it needed, but alas, the story was nowhere to be found.  Can we not be more creative in this genre Hollywood?<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****nsecure shackles of life.  Yet, somehow, no praise is generated for this dog at the end.

B0002OERI0|1.0|You call this Rock And Roll? I don't, the newbie bands, like Green Day, Blink 182, and similar stuff, like Mariah Carrey, have shrouded actual good bands away from pop culture and have been preventing authentic Rock And Roll bands their rise into fame!    I tell you what, I can't wait till this Green Day fad is over, and hopefully when it does, we might finally get some good bands out there that are ambitious as classic bands like Van Halen, Motley Crue, Ac/dc, GNR, Dio, and so on, in their likeness.  (...)! And still, you call this Rock And Roll! Don't waste your money on this CD, you could get your money's worth more on four pairs of boxer briefs instead!

Classics period and the most brutal shxt since suffocations pericied from within infact Cryptopsy when Mike D was on vocals sounded quite the same as Frank and suffocation to bad They didnt keep Mike D around till Suffocation returned what a tour that woulda been but what the hell the one thing deathmetal has tought us over the years is that something may be the best for a time but it is short lived in most cases. You say lord worm is brutal i can name 20 people that could replace him today and make the same sound are better so screw you cryptopsy and see you in the cut out bin there was a reason cryptopsy wasnt known until Mike D showed up and in a year they will just be another causlity on the long list of failed death bands r.i.p

B0002LI58Q|3.0|I know this has been out for a while, but I liked the music so I bought it........until you get it home !!! <br /> <br />When you put it in your CD drive, a message appears saying you have upgraded software, and you are requested to restart your PC. Ooops. The people in power BMG records have added protection software which restarts your computer and stops you from putting it on your PC, hence MP3 copying is really hard work, you have to fiddle with your media player settings etc till you get it saved on your PC  !! <br /> <br />It does play using the software BMG provide but that stops you from doing your own thing with the CD. <br /> <br />I only bought the damn thing cos it would sound good on my mp3 player when training. Talk about tight.   <br /> <br />Anyway, I liked the album, not the best I've heard but certainly worth a listen, <br /> <br />Verdict- buy it but dont agree to the software when you load it or you'll have problems- if they hadnt done that I'd have given it 4 stars.
1400031087|1.0|Regardless of the controversy about the truthfulness of author James Frey, this is a horribly written, poorly edited, and contrived \\"memoir\\" designed solely to pull at the reader's heartstrings using keywords such as \\"addiction\\" and \\"recovery\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, the people that continue to recommend \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" as a useful tool for addicts and now advise to read it solely as a work of fiction after the revelations of Mr. Frey's embellishments and outright lies are espousing the idea that the ends justify the means... an excuse that active addicts make use of in their daily lives and need no more encouragement to continue with.

I will call people by different names or generic names because I don't want you to find me.  I didn't enclose a return address for the same reason.  I mean nothing bad by this.  Honest.\\" -Charlie <br /> Written by Stephen Chbosky, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the most wonderful, daring, extravagant, controversial, and realistic books I've ever read.  Written in journal format, it is a diary that Charlie sends in letters, yet the recipient is never revealed. <br /> Charlie has just lost his best friend to suicide.  He starts his freshman year of high-school with no friends and no confidence.  His brother is hitting the big time at Penn State and his sister is a senior.  He really doesn't mind not having friends...until, he meets the best he's ever had. <br /> Patrick and Sam, who are step-brother and sister, welcome Charlie into their group of friends.  Charlie, being the wallflower he is, listens and tries to please everyone.  They introduce him to the crazy Friday nights of Rocky Horror Picture Show and make going to school much better than the horrible first day.  As school progresses, Charlie's English teacher, Bill, recognizes the potential in Charlie that no one else sees.  He starts giving Charlie extra reading and assignments.  Bill is the only person to see Charlie's intellectual abilities, and the only person to make him feel special about it. <br />Chbosky does a magnificent job of making you fall in love with his characters.  I feel like I've gotten the best letters that have ever been sent to me, from Charlie.  Charlie's unique teen mind is intriguing.  The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a book that I won't soon forget, and will cherish in my memory forever. <br />The mostfun I have ever had reading was spent following Charlie through his rollercoaster of freshman year.  From drugs, to a semi-functional family, to being in love with your best friend, Charlie learns more and more about himself and what he cares about most, feeling infinite. <br />
B0006399FS|3.0|Couple of good songs, the rest not as much. Like their old stuff better.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|\\"The Big Lebowski\\" is just perfect.  Everything about this movie is a laugh riot, even the bits of dialogue that aren't punchlines.  The cast is perfect, the writing is perfect... this movie has both Julianne Moore and Flea in it, what other movies can you say that about?  Well, there was the Gus Van Sant \\"Psycho\\" remake, but that doesn't count.  I found this movie by accident and I haven't let go of it since.  I may not be a stoner but I will say I've found more happiness since I embraced my inner Dude. <br /> <br />Every time I go back to \\"Lebowski\\" I come away with something new that wasn't there before.  Like the realization, this time around, that Jeff Bridges is not seen to throw a single bowling ball in the entire movie.  And that Steve Buscemi's character rolls a strike every time we see him... except for the very final scene, for reasons that become clear a few moments later. <br /> <br />The rest of the cast is just superb.  Remember Philip Seymour Hoffman as an unctuous PR man?  I'd forgotten about that.  Jon Polito (late of \\"Homicide\\") shows up as a P.I. in a familiar-looking purple VW bug.  Even Aimee Mann is in one scene, speaking German.  Oh, and Tara Reid, before her career completely and utterly collapsed.  Top supporting honors go to Sam Elliott, who according to the DVD documentary wasn't even sure what he was doing in the movie, but his opening narration gets funnier every time out (\\"And in English, too!\\"). <br /> <br />Another great thing is the dialogue.  You'd think the whole movie was done by improv, the way the dialogue is so natural.  Every character has their own particular jargon, and just like in real life, people keep repeating phrases they've heard elsewhere.  Jeff Bridges can't seem to finish a sentence, and neither can Steve Buscemi, although that's because John Goodman won't let him.  George Bush gets quoted a lot (\\"This aggression will not stand, man\\"). <br /> <br />Finally, I love the totally unglamorous portrayal of L.A. and Hollywood, limited to tiny theaters, a seedy bowling alley, a weapons store in the barrio, and the In 'n Out Burger (on Camrose).  The actor and artist type characters who show up are all obnoxious or pathetic, particularly David Thewlis's \\"video artist\\", and the chubby dancer/landlord who forgoes collecting rent from the Dude so long as the Dude shows up for his performances.  Not to mention Karl Hungus and the great Ben Gazarra cameo. <br /> <br />But in the end, Jeff Bridges is the glue holding this movie together... and John Goodman... and John Turturro... and... and... aah!  Lost my train of thought here.  But... ah, [...], I've done introduced 'em enough.
B0008KLVG4|2.0|Unless you've been living in a cave, you know this movie well by now and you know whether or not you like it, so I won't go on about that. What's important here is the extras; do they make it worth replacing the DVD copy you already have? The answer, unfortunately, is no, not really.    The extras on the 30th Anniversary edition include deleted scenes and outtakes (already on the Anniversary edition issued in 2000), a documentary about the making of the film (the version on the 2000 edition is better and more to the point), and production photos, storyboards, and marketing materials (only slightly more expansive than the production photos included on the 2000 version). The only new features are an interview piece with Spielberg that was shot during filming (and is thus quaintly and enjoyably archaic) and a booklet of photos from the film which is spotted with quotes from Spielberg and the stars. This is a nice print piece, but it's highly debatable whether it makes the re-investment worthwhile.    Mind you, I love the film, but I'd say buy this only if you don't already own a quality DVD print of the movie. If you do, just stick with what you've got. It's a great film, but this new edition just comes off as a slight repackaging designed to make the principles wealthier than they already are rather than bring us any new appreciation for the movie itself.

0062502182|5.0|I have read this book about 10 times.  I think everyone should be required to read this book at least once in their lifetime. It is one of the top 5 books I have ever read. It is well written and filled with lots of things to think about. You won't feel the same when you finish the book. It is pretty powerful.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|King Kong is a splendid motion picture.  It has the scope and spectacle of films like Titanic and Jurassic Park, yet has the intimacy of any low-budget character drama packed into a grand film.  It's the full package.  Naomi Watts is the emotional anchor of the film.  She does a magnificent job forming a relationship with a the giant ape.  Andy Serkis's movements were used to create Kong's movements, as he did with Gollum in Lord of the Rings.  Adrien Brody serves the story well as Jack Driscoll.  My own personal delight was seeing Jack Black in a roll that wasn't comedic.   Sure, he has his \\"Jack Black moments\\" in this film, but, I like it when a typecasted actor departs from the norm and does something different, even if it may or may not challenge is acting skills.   <br /> <br />The technical virtues of this film can not be described with words.  These special effects, sets, makeup, costumes, etc. are undeniably some of the best ever put on screen.  Peter Jackson's technical department deserves all praise and honor for their efforts.   <br /> <br />There have been some complaints about the film's pace and length.  I would tend to agree that there are a few minor quibbles about the length of the film.  Simply put, it could have been shorter.  The script seems to go into avenues it never fully finishes.  There are characters in the film, whom we share intimate, personal moments with, and then there is no follow-up to their characters.  There is no story arc to their existence.  They are developed, then eaten for dinosaurs, killed by natives, or simply forgotten.  Why spend the time developing certain characters if there isn't going to be any follow up to begin with?  And while we're on the subject of characters, it's in the third act that the principal characters begin to sink into obscurity.  Jack Driscoll is integral to the first two acts, but, in the last fifteen minutes, his presence becomes hollow.  He has one heroic moment when Kong is rampaging through NewYork, and then he is virtually forgotten.  And what happened to Ann Darrow?  She barely says anything, nor does she show as much emotion as when she did on Skull Island?  It's only Carl Denham's character, to me at least, that comes full circle.  But, in all these, it needs to be said that this King Kong has a personality and a heart, and we certainly feel that tear when he falls off the Empre State Building. <br /> <br />King Kong is grand filmmaking.  I loved the film.  Truthfully, I'd give it 4 and a half stars, not five, because of the aforementioned flaws.  Still, I loved it.  I felt like was watching another Titanic of Jurassic Park.  Something we've all seen before, but, it's done in such a way that it still captures our imaginations, and we know we won't see a grand epic like this for another few years.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|During the first few minutes of \\"Porco Rosso\\", I was thinking, 'okay, this is.....different.  It's good but I don't think it's exactly gonna be \\"Spirited Away\\" or \\"Naussicaa\\"'.  I should have known better.  It IS different, it's not \\"Spirited Away\\" or any other Ghibli movie before or since, but it is, in its own bizarre way, just as good.  Studio Ghibli seems to be incapable of delivering anything short of true excellence. <br /> <br />   The title character is a grumpy bipedal pig who flies a World War I-era airplane in the Mediterranean in the years between the two world wars.  Once human, Porco has adopted an air of disinterested apathy to cover his feelings, but he finds himself drawn to a group of people in Italy after his plane is shot down by a rival pilot, rendering Porco unable to make a living protecting transport and passenger ships from pirates - some of the most gloriously incompetent pirates imaginable, by the way.  \\"Porco Rosso' is suitable viewing for the kiddies but may be, in general, enjoyed more by an older audience - in addition to the soaring air battles and action-packed climax, there's plenty of romance, dry humor, and subtle political commentary.  Regardless, it has the Ghibli charm, and is likely to have something for almost everyone.  A truly one-of-a-kind movie (ask youself this: when was the last time you saw a movie about a trenchcoat, goggles and fedora-wearing pig piloting a brightly painted red airplane and fighting sky pirates?) and another jewel in the glorious Ghibli crown.

B00005NB0H|3.0|I, for one, don't like being lied to.  This is not the complete performance.  \\"My Generation\\" and \\"Magic Bus\\" have been trimmed by several minutes.  \\"Spoonful\\" is missing entirely.  \\"Tommy\\" is out of place.  To make matters worse, this CD does not sound as good as the 1995 version.   <br /> <br />To be fair, this is still killer music that deserves to be in any Who fan's collection.  And it features all the original members in their prime.  (Now they're just The Two, and I for one get a kick out of Pete's new lyrics \\"old red wine, well past its prime...\\") <br /> <br />Die hard fans will want this in their collections.  For casual fans, I recommend one of two options:  either purchase the single-disc 1995 Leeds remater, or the 2-CD Isle of Wight set, which is complete and in order, and features most of the same songs.
B000E0WJIC|4.0|When referring to this British four piece, the phrase \\"the next big thing\\" has been tossed around more than a hot potato. Of course, Bullet For My Valentine wouldn't have so much potential if metalcore weren't the fad right now. But there is a disadvantage to metalcore being so popular: there is a lot of competition. Because there are so many other metalcore bands, nothing on \\"The Poison\\" is 100% new or innovative (even the singing-screaming choruses grow old after a while.) Fortunately, BFMV have a few characteristics (like guitar solos) that help them stand out from other bands, like Killswitch Engage. <br /> <br />After the first track (a brief, soft instrumental which is appropriately titled \\"Intro\\" and features Apocalyptica's cellos), \\"Her Voice Resides\\" blows the gates wide open, with super heavy yelling and fiery, chugging riffs. \\"4 Words (To Choke Upon)\\" is backed by a pounding rhythm with fast double bass drumming, and some cleanly sung vocals. \\"Tears Don't Fall\\" is partially melodic and restrained (it begins with soft strumming), but it also has a couple of breakneck tempo changes (where the song catapults into machine gun riffing). The last two tracks worth mentioning are \\"Hit The Floor\\" and \\"Room 409.\\" The former track has scorching guitar work and an almost thunderous beat, and the latter has big, chunky riffs. But both of these songs are still somewhat melodic, because they both have a catchy \\"Woah-oh-oh\\" sing along. <br /> <br />Metalcore has kind of  been run into the ground, so it can be hard, sometimes, to discern which bands are for real and which bands are just imitators. It's definitely nothing we haven't heard before, but \\"The Poison\\" is still an above average metalcore record. It's not great, but it's even further from being bad.  <br /> <br />I can't recommend it to everybody, because it depends on how much you like metalcore, but if you like metal (smokin' riffs and pounding drums) streaked with melody (clean singing and occasional acousticguitars), this is for you. And metalcore diehards will definitely want to check this out, and probably own it. Casual fans, however, should probably skip it.

Having now seen all 3 films in his 'vengeance cycle' I can confidently say that his vision, his sense of style and his disregard for the rules mark him as one of *the* key current filmmakers.   <br />Oldboy is in some ways emblematic of modern Korean cinema - it has no regard for Western conventions of 'single-genre' filmmaking.  It is funny, horrific, thrilling, emotional, disgusting... Park is not scared to evoke every emotion. <br />The story is of a man imprisoned for many years without explanation, then suddenly freed and invited to seek revenge.  It is an unusual story told in an unusual style, and with startling visual imagery and stylistic flourishes.   <br />Not to be missed.

One involving a very rare and strange book and the other involving the Club Dumas. The book is filled with intriguing characters and strange situations.

B0006SSOHC|5.0|I avoided this film for so long until a friend loaned it to me. I watched it last nite and I was quite impressed. To compare this to \\"Se7en\\" is absurd; there's little or no comparison. Director James Wan's youthful zeal and excitement is beautifully executed, but nothing can compare to David Fincher's meticulous style.I was expecting another stupid slasher flick, and was pleasantly surprised to be presented with quite an original narrative that had me fascinated. I did NOT guess the ending, though I tried, because it was so well written and edited. The acting wasn't very good, though not totally unbelievable. After all, hysterical is an emotion that's hard to sustain for 98 minutes if you're an actor. James Wan's focus may not have been as precise as he'd wished, but I look forward to his next project. The extras on the DVD are minimal, but Mr. Wan's enthusiasm on a short extra impressed me. I enjoyed it and was entertained a lot.
B0001GL3K4|4.0|I had read mixed reviews on this movie and was unsure about purchasing it, but I did anyways!  When I received it, I watched it right away and enjoyed it.  Even though the movie went back and forth between characters, I didn't find it hard to follow or confusing.  I thought that it was a romantic movie that made me cry!  And if it's good enough to set off the water works, than it's good enough to recommend to someone else!
B000BKVQTS|3.0|Bad reviews abound for this movie, and maybe that makes me crazy, but I enjoyed it.  I try to never go into a movie, book, whatever, with anything but an open mind.  Maybe that's why I liked it ... because I didn't go into the movie expecting anything huge, and what I got was a pleasant surprise.  Sure, its dark in some parts and this isn't really a movie you'd be taking the kiddies to go see.  Some parts are a little confusing, but I think in the end, all that confusion more or less adds up to something resembling an understandable storyline.   <br /> <br />*Possible spoilers* <br /> <br />Okay, let's break it down.  Will and Jake, the Brothers Grimm, are basically con artists, moving through French occupied Germany and ridding villages of so called enchantments or curses for a hefty sum.  Will (Matt Damon) is the older brother, the womanizer, the one who's in it for the money.  Jake (Heath Ledger) is the one who records the various folktales, the one who has studied them.  He comes across as a dreamer and a kind hearted one at that.  I believe Ledger played the role perfectly, and Jake is really quite adorable and preferable to Will's character.  Well, the brothers are captured by the French army and ordered to find out why little girls are going missing in one German village on the outskirts of a large forest.  From this point on, introduce Caravaldi with his bad accent and even worse toupee.  He's working with the French general played by Jonathan Pryce.  He's sent to watch Jake and Will to make certain they don't try to escape and that they figure out what the heck is going on in this village.  From there, Jake and Will find that there most reliable ally is Angelika, who is thought by the villagers to be cursed and who has lost her father and two sisters.  She shows Will and Jake the forest and leads them to the tower of the Mirror Queen.  Jake believes wholeheartedly that the forest and the tower are enchanted while Will believes some trickster is just puttingon one massive, high priced production with the moving trees and such.  It basically comes to a head when we realize Jake is right, the Mirror Queen really is in the tower, and she's stealing the young girls of the village for their youth.  So, the unconventional heroes save the day, and they all live happily ever after ... I guess.  Yeah, the ending was a little muddled, and I'm not entirely certain how a few of the characters survived.  But, what the heck?  It's more or less a hodgepodge of fairy tales, and if Disney has taught us nothing else, it's that in fairy tales, the bad guy dies and the protagonists always live, no matter what.  Oh, but wait.  We're talking about the Brothers Grimm fairy tales, and not the Disneyfied versions of them.  Oh well.   <br /> <br />Honestly, I don't know what it is, but I was charmed by the movie.  Despite inconsistencies, some mildly disturbing sequences, and some bad attempts at humor, I ejected the DVD and said, \\"Hey, that wasn't half bad.\\"  So sue me, I enjoyed it where some reviewers state it's amazing to see this movie get more than two stars.  My advice to anyone is, it's worth a shot to form your own opinion, just don't expect a movie suitable for young children. <br />
B000002OX7|5.0|The early 1970s were subject to a lot of things which emphasized the end of the sixties. The deaths of Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin alone raised questions and doubts about the future of rock music. However, it is due to albums such as \\"Who's Next\\" that turned that doubt into absolute certainty. Yes, \\"Who's Next\\" is one of the most quintessential rock albums ever to come out of the 1970s, from one of the most quintessential rock bands of the 1960s. It is a magnificent piece of history that defines what real music is, starting with the opening track, \\"Baba O'Riley\\", which opens the door for a distinct, and vivid series of excellent songs. From \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" to \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", The Who single-handedly proved that rock music was not only still alive, but it was ready to kick some serious ass. It has been my greatest gift to be able to listen to this album in a brand new audio spectrum, complete wth some rare gems that no Who fan should be without. My only greivance as to this album is that I haven't listened to any other Who albums to compare \\"Who's Next\\" to. Anybody who wishes to experience the best of 1970s rock music, go to your nearest music store and buy this album, it will be worth your while, to say the least.

1567184855|1.0|I have lots of problems with this book and will give three most important ones why I just can't buy what he's saying<br /><br />1. The way of 'remembering' the past lives is through the hypnosis, and as it is known in the world of science and psychology, this is far from being an effective and accurate way of gathering data.  People are highly suggestible, especially in that state of mind.  If you read Newton's questions carefully you can see that he's actually guiding people, and asking them things that only support his theories.<br /><br />2.  Why are the recollections from some highly known era in the history and from the past that we actually have lots of info about?  There are a few that seem to be from some other world, but they are vague and very similar to the images in our world.  Why are other worlds so similar to ours?  How many of these worlds are out there?  Since the subjects can remember them, can they also remember where they are?<br /><br />3. This one is a deal breaker for the whole book...Newton admits that his patients have some sort of a psychological disorder.  When you combine this with hypnosis and a growing popularity of pseudo-science, you get answers described in this book.<br /><br />People believe that they have been reincarnated, they believe in the spirit world and that we're here to learn and gain experiences so that we can join the 'ultimate spirit' (if you really analyze this, it does not make any sense whatsoever).  I have no doubt that these individuals really beleive this, but so did people believe that the Earth is flat (some actually still do) and that is the center of the Universe.<br /><br />I understand that it is in our human nature to seek our higher purpose, and every time we get a glimpse of some `proof', we receive an extraordinary amount of comfort.  But please, be rational and don't take books like this at their face value.  You only support authors who are getting richer by giving us what we desperately want to hear.<br /><br />A book that everyone should really have in their collection is Carl Sagan's The Demon Haunted World.perately want to hear.   <br /> <br />A book that everyone should really have in their collection is Carl Sagan's The Demon Haunted World.      <br />
B000E8N690|5.0|This is in response to the review by 'None Whatsoever'.  The purpose of being able to submit a reivew on Amazon is to talk about the movie itself.  NOT to read on and on about your opinion of Johnny Cash.  It is obvious by what you wrote that you aware of the type of person he was before you saw the movie.  If he was such a pathetic individual in your eyes then why did you see the movie in the first place?  Also, if you are such an expert on the life of Johnny Cash then you would know that he DID grow up and make something of his life and he went beyond just being a 'good person'.  <br /> <br />This was a job well done by Reese and Joaquin and it is a great love story that is very interesting even if you know nothing about Johnny Cash!

It's a story of compassion, devotion, and love- This is the story of a lawyers struggle through the beginning of his career. <br /> The Rainmaker is about a rooky lawyer named Rudy Baylor who just graduated from law school.  He has passed his bar exam and has taken on his first cases as a lawyer.  Since Rudy has no money and no place to live, he's just looking for some easy money makers.  At least that's what he thinks these cases are, but Rudy gets in over his head.  These so called easy cases turn into a fight for justice in this small town. <br /> With the help of his new found partner, a friend who knows the ropes of law, and some ways around it, Rudy finds the real lawyer inside of him, vs. the lawyer that breezed through college.  He fights for what's right against a dishonest insurance company that won't cover a young man with leukemia and a young woman with an abusive husband. <br /> This story follows his struggles, hardships and breakthroughs.  This is an extraordinary story.  It's a story for all readers and one that everyone will enjoy.  This novel is written so well you feel like you're not just reading it, but your there, in the courtroom, or in the office, or wherever the story may take you.  The details, it's not superficial or unrealistic, and how the characters are written make the story even more real.  It almost feels like a biography, like Rudy's thoughts were written down on paper as he thought them.  Reading this story will inspire young lawyers, and young readers everywhere.  I can truly say that this novel is one that I can read over and over and still be taken aback by this story of affection, love, and allegiance. <br />
0671449028|5.0|My 15 months old daughter reads it every night before going to bed.  The book is not too long, not too short, by the time she's done, she wants to go to bed.  We enjoy all the different characters in the book.  She likes to point at each of them as we read it.  I think it's also a good book for a bilingual family.  The book is easily written that I can sometimes read to her in English and sometimes in Chinese whithout loosing much fun from the translation.

B000A2W1X2|4.0|This is a well acted, quirky period piece with an unusual story line. Here, an English gentleman (Stephen Dillane) is looking for a weekend of fairly anonymous sex in hopes of fathering a child, as his invalid wife is not up to the task. An impoverished Swiss miss (Sophie Marceau) is desperate for money due to her family's circumstances. She passes muster during the initial interview with the English gentleman and is hired for the job of potential surrogate mother. Their nights of anonymous sex turn out to be a surprise for both of them, yet they part with the understanding that they will never again meet. Their union having proved fruitful, she ultimately gives birth to a child, their daughter, who is taken from her immediately after birth and given to the father, as contracted. For seven long years they are separated. They are then all brought together, causing upheaval and tumultuous changes in all their lives.<br /><br />This is a well acted drama with fine performances by the entire cast. The only wrong note is struck by the child who plays the seven year old daughter. She is simply odious and obnoxious, making the viewer itch to slap her. There is nothing that the child does that makes the viewer feel the child's desire for a mother. The other performers, however, more than make up for this one dimensional child actress. Moreover, the cinematography is quite beautiful, with stunning shots of a fairytale lake house. All in all, this is a film that those who love period pieces will enjoy.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I've read some of the recent reviews and I couldn't put things any better. There's people who can appreciate the darkness of this movie, and for other people it's just not appealing at all. <br />I know a few Quentin Tarantino fans who told me this movie is just too much for them to handle. This movie is shocking! But for those who can stomach it, it's ooooh sooooo goooood! Ellen Burstyn (who plays Sara) is brilliant!
B0001XAPY2|5.0|One of Moriyama's best, featuring first rate animation, story and dialogue. The fist fight scene probably makes this film better for the 10-and-over crowd, but the real audiences for this masterpiece are adults who appreciate beautiful animation, 1930's-style heros, and the sounds of radial aircraft engines. Accurate details rivaling those of Herge's famous Tintin comic book series make this a jewel. The english language version has a few voices that could have carried a little more believable emotion, but this is a very minor complaint and is something most viewers will probably not even notice until the third or fourth viewing. Porco Rosso deserves a top ranking in any movie collection.
B000001DYY|5.0|Which I suppose I'm not allowed to say, what with the worldwide phenomenon that was Songs From the Big Chair. But I think it's right. Roland took the opportunity following the breakup with Curt to make an aggressively postmodern record, and return to the steely-eyed austerity that the lyrics on The Hurting always suggested.  Indeed, this album is continually proving to be ahead of its time; as a previous reviewer noted, \\"Goodnight Song\\" has what has since become a familiar AOR sound. I call it the first \\"Coldplay\\" song, and it's fair to suggest that band would never exist without Tears For Fears. <br /> <br />Roland also finally nails the pacing of an album here. On Songs and Seeds, 8 tracks was not enough to allow for a full dynamic arc, a sense of opening, progression, and completion; the 10 songs here have room to breathe, vary significantly between each other and finally close satisfyingly with \\"Goodnight\\". <br /> <br />As both Roland and Curt have matured, they have also mellowed. The anger they felt at the world and towards each other seems to be gone. And their latest album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, has none of the dge that made their older stuff so energizing. But CDs don't age, so pick this sucker up. It really doesn't get much better.

0060899190|5.0|I gave this as a Christmas gift to my sister-in-law.  I thought she might enjoy it because she's the kind of person that just never talks about all the stuff you just know is going on in her head.   <br /> <br />Well, she loved it.  I was at a family gathering last week and all of the siblings were quoting from it.  Apparently everyone had read it as well. <br /> <br />Its a great conversation piece and a must for anyone who thinks that they are alone with their issues.
B00009Z574|2.0|Just thought I'd respond to 'Prigles ' ref the name Tormato . The rock on the cover is  Yes-tor in the middle of Dartmoor ,Devon UK.and is one of many 'tors' in the area The Band were taken up there for the Photo shoot .One of the band -dont know which but sounds like Rick????-apparently thought the idea was silly and threw a tomato againt the photo from which the name/ album cover Tormato was born <br />Not my favourite Yes album but the 'in the round' revolving stage tour that followed was a great idea
B0006399FS|5.0|While I agree with the reviewers who believe this album is different from some of U2's earlier music, I disagree that it is bad. This is another excellent album from one of the best rock group.

B00004WLXZ|5.0|The commentary from the history professor contained in the special features was excellent. It added a new dimension to the spectacle as it explained the background to what was being viewed as as well as interesting information as to what happened to the sinister characters that were being displayed on the screen.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|i started listening to p!atd in october and saw them in concert with fall out boy during their nintendo fusion tour.  although they didn't play for very long, p!atd was the best band out of five that played that night.  i love the cd and listen to it constantly because i can't get enough.  this album is amazing.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Its easy to forget the true brilliance of Belushi now that all these years have passed.  He controls the movie while saying less than 200 words. While film goers today hail Something about Mary, Wedding Crashers, Happy gilmore and the like one need to remember the lunacy of the comedic, frat house farce.
B00005MP58|5.0|Unlike many who have written reviews, I have not read the book... yet. My sister recently introduced this mini-series to me (she owns the dvd) and at first, I was skeptical. I am not a huge fan of period movies. She begged me to watch it with her, so I told her I'd sit down and watch it with the hidden agenda of getting up about 15 minutes into it and making an excuse to leave. <br />That never happened. I was completely captivated in the first scene. After the first half of the movie was done, I was the one begging her to put the second dvd in to watch the rest of this truly amazing movie.  <br />Where do I begin, and what can I say that all the other reviews have not already said, and some so eloquently! I have never before seen a movie where the casting of the characters was so superior! Hats off to the casting directors! Hollywood should take note! <br />It was as if the actors and actresses were born to play these roles. The music, sets, scenes...extraordinary. Jennifer Ehle who played Elizabeth was outstanding, and of course Colin Firth, I don't think there was a bad review about him (and I read about 25-30 reviews). He simply IS Mr. Darcy..dare he play another role!!  <br />Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennet is a riot and that role is hers and hers alone...her character's insistent quest to marry off her five daughters, regardless of the potential suitor's character, is just such a joy to watch!   <br />Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Lady Catherine de Bourgh was also born into her role. What an outstanding actress, as they ALL were. <br /> <br />As I said before, I have never seen a movie where every character is absolutely PERFECT for the role that they play. <br /> <br />So, here it is, from someone who doesn't watch many movies like this. I am now a Pride and Prejudice junky. Bought the dvd and have already watched the movie 3 times and it still is not enough.  <br />I want a sequel. I want to see Elizabeth's and Darcy's children. I want to see how Elizabeth handles being the mistress of that huge castle. I want to see how she handles future dealings with Lady Catherine de Bourgh......essentially, I want to grow up and old with these people!! Get Simon Langton back in the studios with the rest of the cast!! I NEED MORE!!
0792163710|5.0|One of the BEST WESTERNS of ALL TIME. It truly is the movie that started the beginning of the good guy helps out strangers against the bad guys. Then rides off in the distance.
0743544676|4.0|I saw the author's on Oprah and thought the concept was great.  It does have some great ideas but I am not sure I buy into all of them.  If I did, I would never date because no guy is on point 100% of the time!  Still a good read and gets you thinking so I recommend it.

B000059XUP|4.0|This movie has to be the best of all sequels. First off, it is a theatrical release and not some out of tv land, bad movie production like the rest of the sequels.<br /><br />The very first Crow movie is of course, the BEST.<br /><br />And when I first saw City Of Angels, I was doing what everybody was and comparing it to the first with Brandon Lee.<br /><br />But really, this movie is actually pretty cool in its own respect.<br /><br />The visuals were great, color toned this time which is a nice variety to the first film which was more blue and bleak (which was excellent). Vincent Perez was actually not bad as the new Crow and since he's not supposed to be Eric Draven (Brandon Lee)<br /><br />I can totally forgive the fact the he doesnt carry the original's trademarked personality.<br /><br />MIA KIRSHNER IS BEAUTIFUL!!!!!<br /><br />She plays a good roll of the now grown up version of Sarah from the first movie.<br /><br />Iggy Pop is awesome and though hes no actor, he definitely plays the sleezeball a$$h@le very very well.<br /><br />Judah Earl is an ok villain but not much in comparison to Top Dollar from the first film. He's not as charismatic nor really tells anything about his origin.<br /><br />The horrible tragedy is good enough to push viewers with the Crow to have his revenge on the bad guys.<br /><br />The ending of the movie is pretty good, but Id have made it a little more dramatic to contrast the harshness of the film.<br /><br />The music, again, a very cool selection of rock music throughout which brings more quality and movement to the atmosphere.<br /><br />Overall, I do recommend the purchase of this film unlike the last 2 that recently came out.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I took a chance without knowing much but the preview, and I loved it, <br /> <br />Great storyline, funny and crazy dialogue I laughed.  <br /> <br />Worth it, Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0060254920|5.0|What more can be said about this book? My five year old LOVES it and it's one of the few books that I enjoy as much as him, even if I have read it countless times. A classic story that should certainly adorn the shelf of every child.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|My spouse has become addicted to this 2 disc set.  She loves listening to it in out apartment, but I went and showed her how \\"feel\\" the music in our SUV.  My bad.  When she's in the car, it's Phantom time.
B00007ELF2|5.0|I had first watched this movie back when it was released on DVD at about 3 in the morning at a friends house and quickly fell asleep.  When I woke up in the morning my friend said I didn't miss much and said that the movie was boring and sucked so I shouldn't bother watching it again.  So I never did.  Then last week my wife rented it and said she wanted me to watch it with her, so I did.  I was blown away by the power this film carries and by the fact that my friend thought it sucked.  This was one of the best films I have ever seen.  Brilliantly pasted together by Soderberg (who won the oscar fair and square) and wonderfully casted Traffic tells a story that dares to be told.  Told on vignettes we see multiple facits of the drug wars raging in the US of A as well as Mexico.  First we have Ohio Supreme Court judge Robert Wakefield (Douglas) who has just been appointed the nations new Drug Czar.  His postition is very important but jeapordizes his relationship with his wife and teeage daughter Caroline (Christensen in a breathtaking role) who has took up with Seth (Grace) and is now forming quite the heroin addiction.  Next we have  Helena Ayala (Zeta-Jones) who is married to drug kingpin Carlos who has just been inprisioned.  Helena has been unaware of her husbands extracaricular activities until now and Helena has to deal with DEA agents Montel Gordon (Cheadle in yet another commanding performance) and Ray Castro as they try and get to the bottom of her husbands cartel as well as her husbands family friend and business associate (Quaid) trying to put the moves on her himself.  Thirdly we have Javier Rodriguez (Del Toro), a cop south of the border as he battles an ethical war between his own morals and the way of the land as the USA and Mexico battle over the drug trade crossing the border.  This film is perfect in almost everyway and is one that should be mandaroty.  It helps lay out a story that has much meaning in the world we live in today.  Theres a scene where Helena is walking down the street and she passes Javier and in that moment it all makes sense.  As different as these situations are, they are all the same, they are all interconected somehow...and that makes it all the more pertinant for the viewer.
038572179X|5.0|As said so many times before, a beautifully written, profoundly moving novel.   <br /> <br />Since leaving it at that would simply parrot half the reviews already here, perhaps it is better to say that while this is my first book from Ian McEwan, I am now bent on reading everything this author has ever written- and how often is it that a book will cause that type of reaction?   <br /> <br />I cannot wait to see what else he has in store.
B00003CY0V|4.0|I will admitt that this movie does serve up quite a bit of confusion, I mean it took me a few watch throughs to understand some of it, but once I got it I knew I really liked it.  The direction of this film is eye catching and the acting is great, Travolta just blowing you mind as a top-notch baddie.  Travolta plays Gabrial, a self proclaimed anti-terrorist who hires Stan (Jackman) to hack into some mainframe and steal 9.5 billion dollars that the government isn't using in order to fund his war against terrorism.  Berry is the bait sent to lure the hacker.  The FBI though are hot on their tails, the team headed by Don Cheadle who is such a scene stealing actor that he ends up being the most memerable charactor.  The conclution is great, the graphics are insane and Travolta just commands your attention.  He's nuts.  I'd recommend the film because it was different and unlike anything you'll ever see.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|This Movie is great, and is an all time Classic, and was a great deal, buying 2.
B000E97Y6K|1.0|Peter Jackson did a fine job wrangling the long, winding opus of Lord of the Rings to the screen with a good, enthusistic cast, decent effects and a fair appreciation for the source while not being a total slave to it.  His efforts were lavished with good box office, plenty of recognition, awards along with critical acclaim and a blank check from the studios on what he wanted to do next. <br />Can't blame the guy for wanting to wallow in a little self-indulgence, but to take moviegoers still high on his LOTR experience along for the ride was...well, a bit much. <br />Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" could be a really decent 2 hour popcorn flick trapped in 3 hours plus of pretension, ill-advised casting, lazy writing, half-baked effects, overwrought action sequences and an extremely uneven tone.  Is it a adventure-drama? Is it a matinee schlock-fest? Is it \\"Titanic\\" with fur? Who knows...it is definately TOO LONG and too disjointed to tell. Jackson needs to remember what EDITING is and realize not every story has to take a \\"week\\" to tell. His theatrical, far-superior edits of the LOTR movies prove he can do this...there were times while sitting through \\"Kong\\" I groped for the remote...thinking I was at home watching the super-extended, scrapings-off-the-cutting-room-floor DVD version instead of the theatrical release...jeez, one can only imagine how long that extended version's gonna be...and you know it's coming! Storylines that are start and end with no resolution and characters have motivations that suck the life out of what was a simple adventure with a terrifying protagonist..instead of the kinder, gentler beast we get here. The oddest choice is having Denham(the completely awful Jack Black) utter the last classic line (as the character did in the original)  after Jackson has spent 3 plus hours transforming this character into a remorseless, greedy SOB...huh? The only performer who comes off unscathed by the whole affair is Naomi Watts...she gamely gives it her all and herscenes with Kong are what make this long affair watchable. <br />I'm still agog that so many mainstream critics jumped on the high-praise bandwagon for this dud... <br />Save your money folks...this beastly turkey will be beat to death on basic cable soon enough (although with commercials it'll take a week to air) and hope that Jackson has this out of his system enough to tackle something fresh and original with his talent.
B000B5UL7G|2.0|I really like Robbie Williams.  I bought this CD, listened to it once . . . and waited for a catchy beat, lyrical wit, or melodic cohesion.  It never happened. <br />The rhythms sound like they came from a beat box, the band that played \\"How Bizarre\\" wrote better lyrics, and the melodies sound like notes were thrown down the stairs and placed in the songs in whatever random order they were picked up. <br />Buy 'Escapology' or 'Greatest Hits' instead.
0143036556|5.0|Excellent. For a culture like ours, that promotes excessive consumption and immediate gratification with no regard for our future resources, Mr. Diamond's comprehensive work should be mandatory reading in all schools and institutions. He does not present an argument that the end of our civilization is near, but he does point to factors that show it could be around the corner.<br /><br />The string through out the work is the notion that many civilizations have come and gone by exceeding their environments carrying capacity, if not consuming their environment totally.
B000BNI90O|5.0|If you are a movie music fan like me, you know that very often the recording you get on a CD is not a complete set of music from the movie.  The worst offender to this is the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack (it is a great cd, but I keep hoping for an extended version).  Anyway, Howard Shore's best work, in my opinion, from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy was in the Fellowship, and this recording includes EVERYTHING from the movie (even some of the slower, quieter, less recognizable themes).  My favorite addition is the Prologue complete 10 min. orchestration, and the additional music from the Gates of Durin and Mines of Moria.   <br /> <br />Although quite pricey, the collection is superb, and it is historical in the movie making history it belongs to.  And just to add, the Additional DVD digital recording would be a superb addition to any audiophile's dream, I don't have a good enough DVD player or audio system to do it justice, but I'm thinking of getting one just to try this out!
0060989157|5.0|I can't believe it took me till 2006 to read The Dirt! I love Motley Crue, and I couldn't put this book DOWN! Each chapter is awesome and written really well, and the life of this band doesn't have ONE boring moment! Awesome read!!!!
B00003CXDD|5.0|I have always LOVED Willow.    This is a fantasy movie with a noble quest, an evil queen(scary Jean Marsh), dashing hero(one of my favorite Val Kilmer roles as Mad Martigan), love story(Martigan & Sorsha, Willow & Kaiya) , sword-fights, trolls and lots of magic.   There are Fairies and Brownies(Kevin Pollack as a Brownie...another must see).  There are some great scenes which include Mad Martigan defending Willow in a castle full of trolls,  Willow & Mad Martigan sledding away from Bavmorda's army on a shield down a snowy mountain, Kevin Pollack as a Brownie wildly in love with a cat....I could go on and on.   <br /> <br />Warwick Davis is a bravely determined Nelwyn, set on a quest to protect a baby.  He leaves the wife and children he loves to return an infant to her own people.  While he is small in the Daikini world, he has a huge heart.  He has fallen in love with the baby, Elora Danan and vows to protect her.   Willow's nobility attracts others to his cause.  Namely, Mad Martigan who overcomes his selfishness & disillusionment to become a true hero. <br /> <br />The movie has lots of action and great sense of humor.  Willow overcomes many obstacles; including, his lack of self-confidence and finally achies his own personal dream.  My 5 year old daughter loves it.  This is truly a classic.  It is a movie where good things happen to good people and the bad guys get it in the end.
B000002J2B|4.0|This is some of their best music.  Sorry for the lack of detail.  Some great instrumentals!  Yet, even though I was driving my truck, I suddenly thought I was walking within the pines when Your Own Special Way came on.  This song is very sappy.  The guys should be ashamed that is a part of their otherwise great musical resumes.
B000062YAZ|5.0|this album is insane. kerry king and jeff hanneman lay down guitar solo after guitar solo like there's no tomorrow. tom araya spits out the lyrics so feriously it could make your ears bleed. dave lombardo pounds on his drums like a madman on steroids.  <br /> <br />very heavy and extremely fast. what more could you ask for. <br />
B0002IVN9W|1.0|The Arcade Fire have had a rapid ascent in the past year and a half, becoming the darling of every music critic around the globe, winning numerous awards, being joined on stage by the legendary David Bowie on more than one occasion, and are being hailed as the saviors of Alternative Rock. I just find Arcade Fire to be against everything that the genre stood for.     This band is just beyond pretentious with their indie style haircuts, old fashioned suits, overtly artsy album covers, not to mention overdramatic music videos. Alternative used to be about normal guys getting together to play a special brand of unpretentious rock n' roll. I gave Funeral three listens all the way through and i just can't figure out what all the hype is about. Win Butlers voice is just so void of any melody that it makes the album wholly unlistenable. I know some might say that his emoting is what makes the songs special, but lets face the facts here, artists like Eddie Vedder, Layne Staley and Richard Ashcroft could emote light years better than this, with the added gift that they had incredible vocals to match.     As a life long fan of Alternative(i'm 34), it disappoints me to know that this is whats being celebrated as \\"genius\\" today, this is no better than Nickelback, Green Day, Coldplay and all that other Adult Contemporary [...]thats eaten up by the masses. heres a list of classic Alternative albums that Funeral couldn't even come close to reaching the brilliance of.    The Stone Roses- The Stone Roses  The Verve- A Storm In Heaven  Soundgarden- Superunknown  Blind Melon- Soup  Mother Love Bone- Apple  Alice In Chains- Jar of Flies  Pearl Jam- Ten  Nirvana- In Utero  Stone Temple Pilots- Purple  Faith No More- Angel Dust  Pulp- Different Class

6305428522|5.0|Everytime I watch this film, I discover yet another layer. It's entertaining and intriguing, as well as beautifully written,  directed, and acted. I can't recommend this film enough. Watch it more than once and you'll realize how good it is.
B00000K31Q|3.0|This is a perfect example of the teen comedies that glutted the theaters in the late 1990's. The fact that it riffs on Shakespere doesn't lend any crediblity; \\"Taming of the Shrew\\" has been filtered through decades of other movies and television shows, so this plot is thus neither new nor surprising. On the plus side, the acting is great and the whole crew manages to keep the intense teen cheese to a minimum. Nevertheless, a great teen comedy is far from a great movie.
0792841344|4.0|Phantasm was one of the scariest movies to come out of the 70s. Except for the magnificent Angus Scrimm as the Tall Man, the great strength of the movie is not the acting. The strength is not the special effects and the strength is not the plot. The power of the film is the way that the director was able to tap into a universal childhood fear.  Every little kid suspects at some point that mom and dad were wrong and that there really was a boogey man. In Phantasm the kid finds out for sure. I was about nine when I first saw Phantasm and it took me and a whole lot of other kids, days to get over it.  <br /> <br />The movie's man hero is 13 year old Mike. His parents are dead and all he has left is his 20 something year old brother, Jody. Jody is cool but he's not ready to be a father figure and isn't much help. Later, Mike sees something that he really wishes he hadn't.  The Tall Man who runs the town's biggest funeral home can pick up a coffins like they're made of paper. Clearly he aint human and when he realizes that Mike saw him he's out for blood. From this moment on the movie never eases up on the tension. Even the quiet scenes like the Tall Man's estatic reaction to refigeration and Jody's shooting lesson are nerve wracking. When the Tall Man gives young Mike the dead fish stare and says \\"Boooooy!\\" you will shiver. Throw in the mini zombies, the flying death balls and the shapeshifting bimbo and you've got yourself a B movie classic.
B00005ABUB|5.0|I got this from amazon.uk, as well.  It's necessary to have a region-free DVD player, but make sure that you also have a PAL-NTSC converter.  The converter can be stand-alone or built into the VCR.  It's possible to find region-free DVD players with a PAL to NTSC converter for under $100 on the Internet (see, e.g., [...]  Some have complained that the picture quality is bad, because it hasn't been enhanced.  I guess that's something I can live with pretty easily, because it doesn't bother me.  Bionic Woman DVDs, however, are supposed to have superb quality.  I loved this show so much as a youngster and am so glad to have it on DVD now.  Definitely cheaper than getting DVDs from Europe,  however, is getting them from Australia, usually region 2/4/5 PAL.  All my DVD sets from Australia (see [...]) including postage so far, have cost the same as getting them from the US.  From Sidney, Australia, the mail is faster (at least to the western US) than to send something from LA to DC, as well - can't think of a better way to do it.  Australia is definitely my choice if it comes available there first, even over region 1 NTSC - with a multi-region player with converter, it doesn't really matter where in the world DVDs come from.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|Perhaps my five-star rating for Nicolas Cage's \\"Lord of War\\" has to do with exceeding expectations.  I haven't been a big fan of much of Cage's recent action-hero work, and I didn't have high hopes for this latest effort.  What could the same guy who has lately focused on dreck like \\"National Treasure,\\" \\"Gone in 60 Seconds,\\" and \\"Windtalkers\\" have to say about the world of gun trafficking. <br /> <br />Fortunately, Cage has a heck of a lot to say about it, and it's obvious that he's pretty steamed.  Using an intelligent, informed, and sarcastic tone reminiscent of David O. Russell's \\"Three Kings,\\" \\"Lord of War\\" dives into the cynical, mercenary world of international gun trafficking. <br /> <br />From a bravura opening credit sequence that follows a bullet through the manufacturing process to shipping to the brain of a young African combatant, \\"Lord of War\\" makes no bones about its dark subject matter.  Indeed, \\"Lord of War\\" has been criticized for being a heavy-handed film.  That may be true, but many great movies hit hard.  Why should a movie about gun-running be any different? <br /> <br />Cage stars as Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian emigrant whose family lives in anonymous mediocrity in \\"Little Odessa,\\" the Ukranian enclave near Queens in the early 1980s.  Witness to a Russian mob hit job, Orlov has an epiphany when he sees the hundreds of bullet casings left on the floor by the assassins' weapons -- why can't I sell these things?  <br /> <br />The major point this movie makes is that for all the headlines grabbed by nuclear weapons and arms treaties, \\"the real weapon of mass destruction\\" is the AK-47 and similar small arms.  These weapons are more prevalent in and responsible for the cesspools of the world (such as Liberia under Baptiste, a locale that the movie somewhat revels in) than any nuclear warhead.   <br /> <br />Using a gift for business and family connections (an uncle is a military hero and high-ranking officer in the Soviet army), Orlov starts from nothingand becomes one of the world's leading arms dealers.  The 1990s were a dream opportunity for the ambitious arms dealer, as the collapsed Soviet Union had billions in military hardware sitting around, but nobody was minding the store.  And war in the Balkans and especially Africa made sure there were hot markets everywhere.  Soon, Orlov has it all - millions of dollars, a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan), and one of those Manahattan apartments that reek of success. <br /> <br />\\"Lord of War\\" follows a somewhat conventional rags-to-riches-to-loss-of-soul plotline, but there are many twists along the way.  Sure, there are some developments you can see coming (one shot lingers way too long on a vehicle, giving you a clue that it's going to blow up in a couple of seconds . . . which it does), and let's just concede that Nicolas Cage and Jared Leto do not look like siblings.   <br /> <br />But let's not deny that \\"Lord of War\\" has some original, intelligent moments.  Yuri is a brilliant businessman and criminal, and can think on his feet.  He switches the identity of a cargo ship as Interpol agents (led by an earnest Ethan Hawke) swoop in, and he disposes of an entire planeload of small arms in Africa just before Hawke shows up again.  This scene is followed by a masterpiece, as an entire cargo plane gets dismantled by local scavengers in less than 24 hours.  \\"Lord of War\\" looks and feels authentic, and that authenticity leaves a cold pit in your stomach long after its cynical and surprising ending. <br /> <br />If nothing else, Cage's effort in \\"Lord of War\\" has reminded me that he has been in so many lower-profile gems, such as \\"Adaptation,\\" \\"Bringing Out the Dead,\\" and of course, \\"Leaving Las Vegas.\\"  George Clooney once said that he got involved with the atrocious \\"Batman\\" franchise (atrocious before \\"Batman Begins\\" came along, that is) because if he made a big blockbuster, the studios would let him make \\"little movies\\" like \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\" and \\"Syriana.\\"I guess that excuses Cage's involvement in \\"Gone in 60 Seconds.\\"  A little.

B000069HJI|4.0|Even though \\"Famous Last Words\\" came out after Breakfast in America, with similarities in commercial pop songs like \\"It's Raining again\\", it features classics that no one should miss, such as \\"Know Who You Are, C'est Le Bon, Don't Leave Me Now\\". This is Supertramp's last album that belongs into the \\"Best\\" category, along with \\"Supertramp, Crime of the Century, Even in the Quietest Moments, Crisis What Crisis, and Breakfast in America\\".
0743267478|5.0|I've never read anything like this book. Although the story came to a logical and thoughtful conclusion, I easily could have continued to see life in India through the main character's eyes, and appreciate how he processed (and often created), all that happened to him. It's a fun book that I've recommended to others.
B0000039PW|5.0|Illmatic was the best hip hop cd of 1994....Until Ready to Die hit. <br /> <br />1.Intro- A look through Biggie's life.(4/5)  <br />2.Things Done Changed- Big talks about how things have changed in the ghetto and every where else.(5/5)  <br />3.Gimme The Loot- Biggie changes his voice on this song. He planning to steal money and he says how.(5/5)  <br />4.Machine Gun Funk- This song is a G-Funk hiphop song, I heard the hook from another song.(5/5)  <br />5.Warning- This is about somebody wanting to kill Big, and Pop from the Barbershop Warning him about it.(5/5)  <br />6.Ready To Die-Good Song, good lines.(4/5)   <br />7.One More Chance- Song to the ladies, the lyrics on the video is better though.(4/5)  <br />8.#!*@ Me- Bigge having sex with Lil Kim.(1/5) <br />9.The What- The only song with somebody else featured on it.

Very creative song. (5/5)  <br /> <br />This rapper never wrote down any of his rhymes. The man is the best lyrical rapper of all time, king of NY, and he never wrote any of that sh** down? That is crazy, if 2pac wasn't so deep and created so much power in his music 2pac would not be the best rapper of all time. As for Biggie he is a lot better lyrical rapper than 2pac ever was. Buy this classic ablum if you haven't already, the orignal ready to die not that remaster sh**. Peace <br />RIP Notorious BIG aka the king of NY of all time.
B0002CHIJW|4.0|Meir Zarchi's 'I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE(1977)' is simply one of the most brutal revenge flicks ever made & one of the best of the low-budget 70's exploitation horror films. A must have classic that fully lives up to its infamous reputation. This (Millenium Edition) is quite a treat for genre fans!
B000E1155E|5.0|Hype has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of this album. The quality of the album has led to the hype. Can't you yanks understand that?

078681859X|5.0|Jonathan Stroud easily draws you into this book of mystery and magic right from the get go.  He's created a wonderfully magical world, loosely based off of modern England and surrounding regions.  The book has multiple draws, a clever mystery, some well-placed witty humor, and an interesting double-viewpoint telling of the tale. <br /> <br />Chapters are segregated into being written from multiple perspectives, making it enjoyably hard to decide who is the main character.  About half are of Nathaniel, a strong-willed, developing magician.  The book shows his growth from innocence, to a morally-torn boy bent on revenge, and through this uncovering an elaborate plot with his intent to foil.  This book seems more to be on a focus of the development of the character than forcefully trying to make you fall in love with the character itself. <br /> <br />Ironically, the demon, the other \\"storyteller\\" of this book, is easiest to enjoy right off the bat.  Bartimaeus, the demon summoned by Nathaniel to serve his will, gives an interesting twist of view on the story as well as some much welcomed humor to the book.  It keeps a great flow of following a serious story while at the same time giving some much-needed moments of levity. <br /> <br />All and all, when the great writing of Nathaniel's coming of age and Bartimaeus' sour view of us troublesome humans isn't drawing you on and on, the mystery itself will be.  I very much doubt anyone not being inclined to be drawn page to page, thinking they are perhaps some kind of enchantment themselves.  I can't recommend this book enough, as you'll have a hard time finding anything quite similar.

B000002O7C|3.0|...This particular CD is a very poor release. There's barely 29 minutes of music on the disk and many of the memorable cues are not included. Not only that, but the tracks that made it to the CD are in the incorrect order. Sadly, this is what fans of the film and Poledouris have had to put up with. There is, however, an EXTREMELY limited release of the COMPLETE SCORE (I own it) and it features 29 complete tracks from the film. Finding a copy is next to impossible but I was lucky enough to track one down recently. Here is what you get on The Hunt for Red October COMPLETE SCORE:    1. Polijarny Inlet (0:44)  2. Hymn to the Red October (Main Title) (5:06)  3. Putin's Demise (1:01)  4. Graving Dock #4/Two Keys (1:41)  5. Dallas Sonar (1:17)  6. Course Two-Five-Zero/On Course (1:02)  7. \\"Let them Sing\\" (Hymn)/US National Command Meeting (1:22)  8. Three Days Only (0:43)  9. The Chase Begins (2:05)  10. \\"Buckaroo\\" (0:24)  11. Jonsey's Theory (0:38)  12. Red Route 1 (3:34)  13. Ancestral Aid (2:07)  14. Plane Crash (1:54)  15. Ryan Leaves to Dallas (0:53)  16. Ryan Leaves to Dallas (Alternate Version) (0:52)  17.

B000683VI4|5.0|This is an outstanding movie!!! Guys and Girls alike love it!!! Its a tear jerker though thats for sure!!
1400043662|5.0|This book is for people who like to ponder a book a long time after reading it.  It is a good book for bedtime readers, since the chapters are short and the book is easy to remember where you left off if you doze off, book-in-hand. <br /> <br />A good \\"Book Club\\" selection; being metaphysical, it should get people talkiing. <br /> <br />Easily one of the best nonfiction works of 2005.
0451169514|3.0|I still gave this book 3 stars (it's still a decent book,) even though it could've easily been five stars if the author hadn't caught a horrible case of mouth diarrhea. He just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on with pointless details and pop culture references. This is a 1100 page book that should have been 700 pages or less. It would've been great then, but the author has to drag on and on and on. Don't get me wrong, I like King, but I'm not going to defend him when he makes a mistake. I'm no hippie, but doesn't it seem like King goes out his way to waste paper by putting in 400 pages extra of useless details? This would've been one the best if it were 400 or 500 pages shorter. <br /> <br />Bottom line: Rent it from the library or if you do purchase it, save your receipt,  it's only good for one read. After that, it's only useful as a doorstop. The Dead Zone, Night Shift and many others are better than this book, even though it's not without it's charms.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|My wide and I are big Enya fans.  Once again Enya produces a great cd to listen too.
0451197879|1.0|A deranged man, some lsd, some guns, some explosives... sounds like a good book, right? Wrong! This book didn't even get interesting until into the 250's page range, which shouldn't be a problem, right? Well, it wouldn't be if THE FRIGGIN BOOK WAS LONGER THAN 307 PAGES! That's right, it takes over 250 pages for the book to get intersting, but at that point, it's almost over. Around 50 pages of excitement. The rest of the time, it's just some loser who whines about his stupid house being torn down so a highway can be built over it, even though the state gives him $65,000 for a $60,000 house (this was back in '73, when $5,000 extra was still alot of money, btw) And then his hag of a wife dumps him, then he sleeps with some hitch-hiker girl, then he blows himself (and the highway) up with explosives. Then the state rebuilds the highway, anyways. So, this loser achieved nothing.  This book is so pointless and boring. I'd give it a 0.25/5 stars if amazon.com would let me!    This book is useless... at 300 pages, it's even too light to be a doorstop! Way to waste trees for  no reason, Mr. King! Buy Nighshift, The Deadzone, or Different Seasons instead of this garbage.
B00000ILDE|4.0|Like others have said, this is actually one of those sequels that is good and well done.  I like the developing story on the planet LB-426 and the attempted colonization of this nasty planet.  I also liked the fact that the Alien species was further revealed, especially that wickedly-cool queen / leader.  Very nicely done.  Overall, this movie rocked and the special edition transfer was great along with the sound.  The action flowed nicely and I was glued to my seat waiting to see what happens next.  Cameron does a solid job of directing here and the tension was almost as good as the first film.  VERY cool! <br /> <br />However, nothing is perfect so here a few things I could have done without: <br /> <br />- The overly obnoxious and cocky military characters.  I understand that to do a job like they did you had to be a little \\"twisted\\" but I believe this was too over the top and I grew tired of the \\"tough guy\\" \\"bring em on\\" attitude. <br /> <br />- Although I liked Newt, her survival was a little hard to believe and she also seemed to get out of every other jam she was in just in the nick of time. Not bad for a SEVEN year old??? <br /> <br />Not much to gripe about though, this a is a MUST SEE and falls nicely within the Alien saga.  Highly recommended!!!!
076113719X|4.0|This calendar is a fantastic way to keep track of everyone in the family.  There is plenty of room to write and it is very cute ont he wall.

B000024KC2|4.0|I bought the U.S. version of this first, so I'm obviously more partial to that one. This U.K. version was the first one to be recorded and has Micky Moody instead of guitarist John Sykes, and some bassist by the name of Colin instead of original Whitesnake member Neil Murray. The songs are in a completely different order, starting out with the atmospheric hard rocker \\" Gambler \\" instead of the title track, which actually comes next.<br /><br />The difference in the mixes are immediately noticeable...the U.S. version has the guitars and drums louder in the mix, while Jon Lord's keyboards and Colin's bass are more prominent on the U.K. version. There is also a noticeable difference in some of the backing vocals. As I stated earlier, I prefer the U.S. one, probably because I heard it first and I think it sounds louder, more radio friendly and has more guitar.<br /><br />Well, whatever one you choose to buy, this is still a very good album and one of Whitesnake's best albums. It's more consistent in terms of musical style than their earlier albums, with the emphasis more on straight forward, in your face hard rock, with just a little bit (but not too much) rhythm and blues thrown in. And Coverdale still has a bit of a preacher man quality about his singing, except that he is preaching about love and sex and sliding his thingy in! He is in top vocal form here, as well. Cozy Powell provides a very solid backbeat throughout the entire album, breathing some extra fire into these songs. And the guitar playing cannot be faulted either.<br /><br />In terms of songs, my favorites include the blistering title track (though I like the U.S. version of this song much better, especially Sykes' guitar solo, which just blows me mind!), the aforementioned \\" Gambler \\", the upbeat hard rocker \\" Guilty of Love \\", the highly singalongable and clappable \\" Slow An' Easy \\", and \\"Standing In the Shadow \\"( I particularly like the backing vocals during the refrain).<br /><br />There is some filler here, like \\" Hungry For Love \\", and \\"Spit It Out \\", but overall, I find this to be one of Whitesnake's most consistently listenable and enjoyable albums.e \\", and \\"Spit It Out \\", but overall, I find this to be one of Whitesnake's most consistently listenable and enjoyable albums.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I don't have cable television, and therefore hadn't seen this show before stumbling on it as a DVD rental. From the first episode, I was instantly hooked. The writing is smart and quick, and the two main characters are extremely likable (Lorelai and Rory). There are some ancillary \\"towns folk\\" characters that I find more annoying than entertaining, but luckily, I can fast forward through their scenes without losing the gist of the storyline. (God bless DVDs...) If you like to laugh, enjoy intelligent writing, and have a penchant for life in a small New England town, this show delivers.
0553801503|2.0|This series started out fast moving and exciting.  As a new book would come out, things started to slow down.  In this latest book, I found nothing exciting, interesting, or fast moving.  Mr. Martin is an excellent writer, BUT he tries to put too much background into each personality which lengthens the book and increases the boring aspect.  I was actually looking forward to this book, and had paid for it 18-months before it FINALLY was released.  If the same happens for book 5, this reader can do without it.  The theme is excellent, the characters are fantastic  and the settings are very good.  I don't need to read 20 pages about how green/brown the grass is, how cold and deep a stream is, or how beautiful/gruesome a person is.  This book could have been written with a least half the pages.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|Somehow, I think something must've been lost in adapting this from stage to screen...the story is not bad, many of the songs are great, but somehow the whole thing is a bit listless, clunky even in parts... <br /> <br />Parts of it, too, are just too sappy, too well intentioned...I haven't seen the stage version - maybe it contains the elements that are missing from this well-meaning, but failed filmed attempt at it.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Hey, lighten up, oh puckered product reviewers who can't seem to blast this flick enough.  Can we all agree the very premise of this movie--along with all the wacky, physics-defying pseudo-science--requires a suspension of disbelief the size of, say, the Milky Way Galaxy?  Can't we all just get along?<br /><br />ARMAGEDDON isn't a scientific treatise on how to successfully stop an asteroid the size of Texas from destroying the earth; it's a white-knuckled, strap-it-on and strap-it-up, grit your teeth and enjoy the ride roller coaster.  This movie delivers nonstop action like a law firm cranking out past-due statements; ARMAGEDDON's got it all, from a slingshot lunar ride, to thrills and chills with a nuclear weapon, to even one spaced-out Russian cosmonaut.<br /><br />All viewers please check quantum physics at the door.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, a cantankerous leader of a bunch of renegade roughnecks (roughnecks who must fly to the asteroid and drill through 800 feet of solid metal and drop a nuke in the hole, mind you), is solid.  Ben Affleck reminded me of a whiny, annoying teenager; Liv Tyler had me more solid than the meteor itself.  Billy Bob Thornton. . .yeah, okay.  The rest of the cast works well together--they look like they had fun making this movie.  Which is only fitting:  I dang sure had fun watching it.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON
B000083C49|5.0|After the death of Spock and Kirk's son (not to mention the demise of the Enterprise), the tone of the Star Trek films was growing dark. And so, it was definitely time to \\"lighten up!\\" It was no wonder that movie goers packed the theatres to see \\"The Voyage Home\\", which became the most successful Trek film (so far). It's a film which reaches a wide audience with the message: you don't have to be familiar with all the Trek trappings to enjoy it.  <br />Opening with the appearance of a mysterious alien probe--and Kirk & crew preparing to depart Vulcan in their newly-acquired Klingon ship to face the consequences of their actions back on Earth--the probe's transmissions are so overwhelming that any vessel approaching is rendered instantly powerless (and helpless). Once arriving at Earth, the probe \\"innocently\\" begins to ionize the atmosphere as it attempts to communicate. But with whom? Spock concludes that the messages are not meant for man, but for whales. And since whales no longer exist in the 23rd century, the crew must risk time travel to find whales in the past and bring them to their own time to respond to the probe before it destroys Earth. (Got all that, so far?) <br />What begins as a serious story turns into a lighthearted \\"fish-out-of-water\\" (pardon the pun!) farce once the crew clashes with 20th-century culture, circa 1986, San Francisco. Kirk & Spock soon clash themselves with a whale biologist, Dr. Gillian Taylor, played with feistiness & likability by Catherine Hicks. Hicks blends humor, exasperation, and flirtation in her scenes with Kirk & Spock, as she tries frustratingly to figure out who these odd men are, and why they're so interested in her whales, George & Gracie.  <br />As Leonard Nimoy did with \\"The Search for Spock\\", he allows each crew member to have some great moments: imagine Checkov wandering the streets of Frisco asking about the \\"nuclear wessels?\\" Or McCoy & Scotty tempting a plastics manufacturer with the recipe for transparent aluminum in exchange for materials to build a whale tank? Or Spock administering the Vulcan nerve pinch to an unruly punk rocker on a bus?  <br />Nimoy surpasses his previous directorial effort with this one, so fresh & original in its storyline that it's hard to resist. With a strong ecological message at the center---when \\"man destroys other creatures, he's destroying his future\\"---Nimoy manages to deliver that message without making it seem heavy-handed.  <br />And the Bird of Prey is such a fascinating ship that the absence of the Enterprise was hardly missed. The Bird of Prey is an impressive creation, with the out-stretched neck of a vulture and wings which can move in a \\"defensive\\" posture when going in for the kill.  <br />As mentioned, there are several subplots happening as each \\"team\\" tries to accomplish their task. However, the delightful subplot of Spock attempting to get back in touch with his human side by way of \\"guesses\\" and \\"colorful metaphors\\" is quite amusing.  <br />This is easily one of the best of the series; it belongs next to \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" as a fun & satisfying adventure.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I took some homophobic friends to see this film today and watched as they felt guilty to mock it afterwards. The combination of crumbling families and discrimination forces the audience to mourn the pain of the characters, especially Heather Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams.<br /><br />This is a perfect example of how individuals weigh the importance of social acceptance with the overwhelming power of love. The realistic display of these characters stumbling through their lives, unsure of which path to choose, gives everyone who sees the film a glimpse of what it's like to conceal their real selves from loved ones and society at large.<br /><br />Ang Lee did an amazing job sculpting so much pain into a work of art.
