0062082353|5.0|Reminds me of the book Tiger force. Considering I've never been in the military and don't know what it's like. I love these books they really bring me into the reality of war. I don't like war but somebody has to do it. And these guys have a crazy,and bravery I'll never know.<br /><br />Ray
B004HD61KE|5.0|Great story but disappointed in ending. DON'T WANT TO BE A SPOILER but the salvaging from disaster just seemed too simple to work. However, the ending does seem to be a lead in to more to come. WORTH THE READ.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would absolutely recommend reading this series. These books are great. I read all three in two weeks while I was working full-time. I couldn't put them down. Read them!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this version of Mahjong.  The tile are clear to read and there are so many levels to play.  The background music is so soothing and relaxing.  There are many background choices to choose from.  I've been playing this regularly for a couple of weeks now and have not had any problems with this app.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|..but it is a very good case . The only reason that I gave this spicy a four instead of a five, is because it did not have a thing to seal the case. But, it does keep it protected benchmarks me satisfied.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Although I totally enjoy the talented groups on &#34;The Sing Off&#34;, I didn't expect much from this movie. I'm too old to appreciate some of the grosser scenes -- still, overall, it was fun and the music was pleasant, nothing magical but still enjoyable. Good rental for Kindle Fire!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would absolutely recommend reading this series. These books are great. I read all three in two weeks while I was working full-time. I couldn't put them down. Read them!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is an entertaining game for those people who like to pop in and out of their games. I would definitely recommend it to those who like issuing orders then returning later to see the results.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Will be reading the rest of this series. King and Maxwell will keep me entertained for awhile.
B00023BLXK|5.0|I received the dvd in good time and it works well.  There are no skips or anything like that. Love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would absolutely recommend reading this series. These books are great. I read all three in two weeks while I was working full-time. I couldn't put them down. Read them!!
B007HGPBRC|4.0|Bittersweet last words from one of the most poignant and relevant writers of our time. He was provocative, controversial and always left me wanting more.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This is a pretty crazy series that I have tried to watch with my wife but I'm not willing to put in the time to go back and watch them all from the beginning so I'm pretty lost usually.  If you want to try to watch this and really enjoy it make sure to start from the beginning.  I enjoy watching it for a short time with my wife though.
0765325950|1.0|I was going to get this immediately as an eBook.  Since Harriet doesn't want me to read it the way I want, I decided to just use ploy summaries online to figure out what happened.  Eventually, I'll just get the AudioBook from the library and listen to it instead of reading it at all.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Some of the previous reviews complained that the packaging was skimpy- but it's fine- I didn't buy it to show other people the box it came in!
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|This book is amazing! I couldn't put it down. Is there another book after this one?! Just amazing. I love it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It was averagely written at best. Much of the details about the locations were incorrect. Also the entire book was one note. No real story development.
0920668372|5.0|this is a beautiful book and I gave each of my grown children this for christmas. They thought I was nuts until they read it.
B000002LEE|5.0|This cd is full of music that is just plain good.  It always makes me nervous buying a cd because I like a few songs from it but with Jane's Addiction I know I am getting a good, solid cd that is worth the money.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had quit using my kindle for a year, and when I went back to get it, the coating on the cord was sort of flaking off.  Having seen other comments here, I contacted Amazon, and even though my device was well past the one-year warranty period, they issued me a promo so I could purchase this cable.  Amazon, you are the best!!  Thank you!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|ITS GOOD<br />I REALLY LIKED THUS BOOK , it helped me a lot ITS sweet yeah I love it ITS so cool, ITS the best
0316227706|3.0|I bought this book for my dad, who loves dogs.  It's all photos, all dogs, which is perfect.  All the photos are of dogs lunging for a ball, underwater, and some are all teeth, and quite ugly/scary.  I was disapointed by the number of photos I didn't want to look at.  A quibble.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I LOVE How I Met Your Mother.  In a nutshell, the show is about a group of friends and watching them grow through their trials and their joys.  It is awesome.  And everytime I am finished I just want to put in another episode.  I truly can't get enough.
B006S01GH2|5.0|It is a charming, yet different kind of movie. Not something you see every day. It might seem a little strange in the beginning, however, it is clever in its plot. A movie you will watch a second, a third time.
0307474259|5.0|This is a short version of Good Calories Bad Calories. If you want more detail, buy his other book. This one is short and to the point. 5 stars for both.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing and touching. Just like Hazel wants to know what happens to Anna, i want to know what happens to Hazel. I love this story
B00005V9IL|3.0|Not a lot of extras and the picture quality was a little grainy but I guess I'm spoiled with blue ray.  Had the alternate ending I wanted though
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The most captivating series i've seen. It comes out on top of other's such as London Hospital, Bleak House to name a few. I hope the Downton will continue even after season three.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|An amazing tale that introduces a dynamic character in Jack Teacher!  Continually able to hold the interest and imagination of the reader.
B00936A0RU|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loves it! We have watched it several times and our friends have borrowed it many times, as well.
B004UQPM4E|4.0|I love what I have watched so far but haven't gotten through the whole thing yet....seems to have maybe a little less than the DVD set
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|fair worth the time if you don't have anything else to do.<br />Thankfully you don't have to buy it.  Go rental
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Very addicting. Love playing it. It does however, take up more of my time than I should give it. Oh well!
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|My husband and I have watched this movie dozens and dozens of times and it never gets old. You have to pay attention from beginning to end for it all to make sense.
0321885112|5.0|Once I started sketchnoting in my design process, my iteration abilities and idea generation went through the roof. Sketchnoting isn't just for conferences! This book will help you think outside of linear note-taking.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow... just, wow! This is the best piece of writing I have ever read. John Green has outdone himself with this one.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|love mahjong  also downloaded the barnyard one.<br />it;s very entertaining to me<br />good to keep your mind alert and busy
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This is the first movie that I have actually sat through and watched the entire thing without getting up. It has suspence, action, and a great story line. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B008NMT684|5.0|I purchased this for my Kindle Fire HD and it works like a dream for my 3 year old son. He loves anything on wheels and puzzles so this was a perfect match for him. I love to take it out while waiting in the doctor's office or at other appointments to keep him out of trouble and occupied. Worth the cost for the full version!
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this game. It's addictive, fun, and works well on my T-Mobile MyTouch 4G. It does take about 15 seconds to load, but that's expected for a game with good graphics and interface.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|very fun worth the money to unlock full verison. have done other g5 games and this one fits well. the four is because it could have had few more puzzles
B005LAIGRS|4.0|This movie is really interesting and good. You have to pay attention from beginning to end though, or it won't make sense.
0061537969|5.0|This book is an engaging exploration of a poignant life story as observed by a dog. Many insights are drawn from the principles of race-car driving and their application to living an intentioned life. This is a good read that will leave its mark on the way the reader looks at dogs as well as life.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Step by step guide to ensure your manuscript looks good on Kindle. Assumes little knowledge and explains the reasons for the necessary steps.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its the best minecraft for a kindele fire but we need creepers and zombies and spiders and one more skeletons to and animals
B00866JL96|5.0|This movie has sad and happy parts in it and is a great chick flick. My husband watched it with me the first time and he thought it was okay. Great story line.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Loved this book. Kept me guessing till the end. Surprised all the way thru.wonderful read. Loved loved loved it.totally a
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I play a lot of first person shooters, i recommend this remote, not to be confused wiht the pro power a which is not rechargeabl
B004784ZKM|1.0|One of my favourite albums of the seventies. However, it took forever to download. When the download was complete all of the songs were not there and it only downloaded to Cloud and not device. All of my other Amazon mp3 downloads automatically downloaded to both.<br />I don't think I'll be downloading any more music from this site.
B005LAII12|5.0|If you have a great sense of humor and don't mind some crude remarks and activity, you will love this movie! It also doesn't hurt to have a cocktail in hand when watching it.
0765325950|5.0|Loved it!  Not everything was answered, but that makes it better.  The wheel continues to spin.  Jordan's legacy is intact.  Brandon Sanderson did a super job (as he does on everything he writes).  Pick up Mistborn or Elantris if you are looking for something to read next!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|this movie was typical action movie with very little exceptional with the exception of a fight while leaping across horseback
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My family just LOVES this game! Angry birds are played often in our home! Very fun and entertaining! Two thumbs up!
B000S81MHY|4.0|I love this table for my mini Drill Press.  The only thing I don't like is the way the clamps tables are not attached.  It will be easy to have them misplaced when not in use.  Otherwise, a very nice quality piece of equipment.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I thought it's a  boring movie but to my surprise, I ended up enjoying this movie a lot. It's heartwarming,funny and I think it will be nice to watch even around children.  It's difficult to find this kind of movie nowadays.  I actually watched it twice in 2 consecutive days-first alone, then with the whole family. And they enjoyed too.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I haven't gotten too far into the game, but I am already impressed.  I like the setup and how it plays with all of the Star Wars sounds.  It also has a lot more options for the birds, which helps to make it better than just a regular Angry Birds' game.<br /><br />My only complaint is that you see the arc where the bird is going to fly.  I think there is more challenge when you can't see the arc, and I don't like when games make it too easy for people to beat it.
B007WV05GY|5.0|I loved it, kept me on the edge of my seat. One of Liam Neeson's absolute best works. I'll watch it many more times.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I think I read this book with only one breath from start to finish.  At least I think I did because I was totally breathless at the end. Loved it!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Some of the instructions did not seem to work as described.<br />Nice to have my books from my kindle available on my tablet,, too.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Great series. Don't know how I missed it all these years. Will be buying the rest of the series soon.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie. All of the series are great and i would recommend this movie to others. AMEN
B0091ICDHU|5.0|One of the best reads of the year so far, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Really well thought out story line and I love Colleen Hoovers writing style. You have to read her book Hopeless as well.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|All you haters at the 1's and 2's. This was in the way of a classic folk yarn with simple story and simple values. It was a fun, cute movie and well worth watching. You had me going there, now I am only sad I waited so long to watch it believing you all this time.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I just love Pink and this Cd is awesome! and got it for much cheaper then you would at the store. Shipped on time and wasnt damaged.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this app was great with great graphicsgraphics<br />I would recommend it to all my friends it's just like the cartoon
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best game ever because it is funny when the cop runs. I got fresh,tricky,elf tricky,tagbot,Lucy and tasha.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You have to play this game with skill but it is totally awesome! I played for hours straight I think.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I was super happy that I was able to catch up when I needed to! Shipped on time never had any issues
0765325950|1.0|I don't remember when I first discovered The Wheel of Time books but if I remember correctly the 3rd book had not been published. So for all of these years I have bought the hardcover copies as they were released. But over the years my eye sight began to degrade to the point even hardcover print became to hard to read. So I stopped reading. However my wife bought me a Kindle Fire for Christmas this year.<br />It was so awesome I could choose my font size and it is so easy to handle. I went to Amazon and bought the Wheel of Time books I had not read and I was very impressed with Mr. Brandon Sanderson's work on The Gathering Storm and the Towers<br />of Midnight I was so looking forward to the final book after all these years. So now I will just have to wait for the ebook when it is released. Wouldn't it be sad if the final book of this epic story didn't make the Best Seller list because I'm sure I'm not the only Jordan fan that's getting old and finds reading standard print fonts a pain. Very Disappointing.
0767821629|5.0|Opens your mind to new possiblities and makes one think of who one really is.<br />Another good film if you are interested in expanding your thinking.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Typically this is my type of movie. Unfortunately,  this movie did not work for me. I thought they could have done a lot more with all aspects of it.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I just love Pink and this Cd is awesome! and got it for much cheaper then you would at the store. Shipped on time and wasnt damaged
B000YMM3CC|5.0|For those who still think true love is possible to find.. even when you struggle through out the years to get to the right person. This movie touches the simplicity and nature of love and what it means being a couple.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love this book. It takes you a long time to read. But, it is totally worth your money. Love it!
B000MMMT46|5.0|I can't remember if i've seen Flogging Molly live or not...well, I guess if I can't remember than I haven't, or...Anywhooo, this is a must have it really is. My all time favorite album by 'em is Swagger, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy Drunken Lullabies. Buy this album, please.<br /><br />And stay away from Speed of Darkness, I think that's their newest album...ew
B004XVN1T4|3.0|With the exception of his newest trilogy, I've read everything ever written by Ken Follett... which is why I can only give this effort 3 stars.  From another writer, this would probably merit a strong 4 stars, but Follett suffers from the expectations he has created with his other works.<br />As a quick read for someone itching for a &#34;quick in and out&#34; mystery, this definitely scratches the right spot.  However, the characters just seem a bit underdeveloped and the plot just a bit contrived.  &#34;Triple&#34; does demonstrate that- given enough pages and thought- Follett could probably produce some very compelling political thrillers.  However, with this effort it seems he was willing to produce an entertaining, quick read.<br />Worth a read?  Yes.  One of Follett's best?  Not really.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Cool fun addicted but needs better creative mode n villages g g g g g g g g g v b
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't want to read this book because I didn't think I would like it. I normally go for erotic fiction about adults with more emphasis on the romance but I like to read about people like me in their late 30's. I didn't think I would enjoy a book about a 17  year old girl. I am so glad I listened to my friend and read it anyway. It blew me away. This book is one of those books that you can't stop turning the page and you can't wait to find out what is going to happen next. I have 3 young children - 2 are 1 year old twins. I started this during naptime and thought I was going to literally die waiting for bedtime last night so that I could finish the book. It was that good. The author does an amazing job with words that just make you smile and while some of the subject matter is dark, she does such a good job with it that you are just pulling for the main characters with all your heart and soul. Carve time out in your day to sit and read, you will not want to stop. I wish it was yesterday so I would be reading this book. Enjoy :)
B00957D58I|5.0|Five stars for sure for Bob Dylan just being him, for his amazing voice, for his rad guitar plucking and picking, and of course his lyrics. I adore his music, i'm in a totally different place when I play this record, I escape. That being said, the actual vinyl has a pretty gnarly scratch on it, so every time it plays over it, &#34;click...click...click...click, etc.&#34; That also being said, it is used, so you get what'cha buy. Overall i'm totally ecstatic about this album. If you don't already have this or any other Dylan albums, BUY 'EM YOU FOOLS!!!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I typically enjoy anything by Preston & Childs, and &#34;Two Graves&#34; was no exception.  This installment- perhaps more than any other- really advances the reader's knowledge of Agent Pendergast's history.  Even if the plot is just slightly predictable, the story is compelling and satisfying.
B006UV8DJS|3.0|When I first got it,  I was disgusted because I couldn't find any instructions on how to use it.  Was new to photo editing, so I wasn't sure of what to do and how.  Now, with a big more experience and some app updates that made if better, I'd say this is a workable app.
B007SGM084|5.0|Wasn't sur it I wasnt to read the book but then I was in to Third book. Nice love story
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I love Nickelback. I could listen to them all the time. This CD didnt let me down. If you like Nickelback you will like this CD.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|if you're a Zeppelin fan or not....you got to own this. The old guys still got it and to have John Bonhams son Jason drumming , to top it off, only adds to it. Just sit back, relax and let it take you to the &#34;wayback machine&#34;. Just watch it or have it playing in the background.
0525953728|5.0|Readong this book makes one proud to be an American and so proud of our military even when they keep it a secret .
0062060562|5.0|The element of raw emotion held me gripped to the very last page. I did not expect that she would survive the turmoil of losing her memory every day. A really enjoyable book. I look forward to the next novel.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game keeps me busy. Whenever I need to clear my head this is what I run to. I love how there are so many levels to it.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Exactly what I wanted.  Words to songs were a big plus too.  I'm glad I got the extended version and not the standard.
B000SW2F80|4.0|30 years old and this horror anthology still holds up well even today. It's a fun, clever, often gory ride that provides more than a few legitimate scares. &#34;Creepshow&#34; is a classic in the best sense of the word.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Never bought a T.I. album until this one and happy I did! trouble man is a classic, real rap for all you tight jean kids!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|And worth every penny. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Love Anna Kendrick, who plays the lead. Skylar Astin was incredible. And Rebel Wilson is my favorite person ever.
0375850864|5.0|One of the most memorable and moving books I've read, it delights and surprises throughout.  Highly recommended for all ages.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|I like Kate Beckinsale in the underworld movies and wish she would be the main star in all of them. As always great job, well done, and keept nice and dark, just like the other Underworld movies. I enjoy them all.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|i read a lot for work and having a place with all my pdfs is really convenient. highlighting notes is also very easy. sometimes it shuts down for no reason but it always saves my place.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was a wonderful book so inspiring about a wonderful American hero! I'd be honored to shake his hand and thank him, I might give him a kiss too.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|There are very few albums that I come across that virtually every song is thoughtful/well done, and not &#34;album filler&#34;.  This is one of those, its fantastic.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|I like the movie itself but somehow I don't find Kristen Stewart a convincing snow white... all together its entertaining but not sure I really &#34; had to&#34; buy it.
B005HSL626|5.0|It is fun for the little one.  keeps them busy for a long time.  easy for them to play this one
0596522347|4.0|Happy with how easy it is to read. Professor suggested it and now a web student borrowed from me because he liked it so much.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|First off,I love this game! I first started playing this game on my iPad. I then bought My Kingdom for the Princess III which I found plays fine on my phone but not on my new kindle fire HD. I did download the free version first to see if it would load, but the up grade price of $2.99 was more than the $.99 sales price of the full game. I bought the full game and it works fine. I hope that the third version will eventually work too.
B000059GEH|5.0|I love Lauren in this movie, this is fun and light entertainment as it's best. Get the popcorn and cuddle down for a fun movie the whole family can enjoy. simple and funny entertainment with hollywoods glamoure girls what more can you ask for!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVE this book!! Full of action, drama, and love. I would recommend this book for those seekers, as well as those who love twilight!
B003RV23KE|3.0|CGI and action was good, but story was just OK. Character developementof of the different gods or the main guy didn't work for me. Good for mindless fun.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Oddly I am not an SNL watcher or 30 Rock (although siblings and friends and most everyone in my college dorm were.  SNL that is.)  Suffice to say Tina Fey came onto my radar due to her portrayal of Sarah Palin.  This is also my first autobiography in a long time but being of similar age, working jobs that require long hours and late nights and trying to raise a family,  it was nice to read a matter of fact, romp through her life to date and to see someone else's journey in that area who is not work-at-home.  It even made watching the Emmy's year with her and Amy Koehler that much more enjoyable.  Thumbs up on her Prayer for her daughter!  I definitely recommend this book.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|who would not love to live in that house...out on its own little island...and the twist of the storyline was quite unexpected. I like Dan Radcliffe in this and think he is much more the just Harry Potter.
0767827902|5.0|It has been a long time since I first time I saw this movie, and I had forgotten just how good that it is.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|works very well and love that it covers multiple areas .  It is the same as going on the web . perfect for day to day planning .
B007GCY8FS|5.0|i stand amazed as to the way he dovetails his many plots within a single book.<br />once you get to the end it all makes sense even though he has snagged your mind in just the 1st chapter
B004N66XYE|5.0|I was a litlle worried that the original flavor of this TV series would not be accomplished in this, but oh was I wrong.<br />I was glued to the TV and watched the whole series in two days... Well done, interesting twists and just a great series...now the wait for season two is on...
0784011710|3.0|I don't know what I was expecting, but I was disapointed.  Maybe I was just too tired when I watched it, so I will watch it again.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|While this novel by John Grisham is not my favorite of his it was still a nice read. He is sure to mention several times it is entirely fictional, which I was glad he did in his author's note and introduction. It had me questioning our government system the entire time as well as what is covered up during American litigation. I would recommend this to others for a fun, quick, easy read.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy has been a read for me since day 1. i don't care for his 'Ops Center' genre but his novels are a good way to spend a day. you just might have to keep reading past your bedtime.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I like this version the best, having seen many different once I have to admit this is in my humble eyes the best one. well worth it
B004UHF51S|5.0|Listening to Michael Franks relaxes me.  His songs are versatile, from whimsical to romantic, and evoke pleasant memories.  Happy to have this CD in my collection.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Obviously not Oscar caliber, but it's fun to watch these guys in caricatures of their screen personae. Great fun, as long as you don't mind the blatant cheesiness
B009KKLQVS|1.0|The sound is off and I have to send it back. What a pain. This was a gift for Christmas. Amazon was fabulous...when i chatted, they sent me a second copy...unfortunately also very poor quality for a fabulous group.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I couldn't watch this movie since the amazon download kept quitting on us and then finally terminated completely.  Must consider whether amazon is worth our time and money.
B0032Y0OH0|4.0|I have had a Contour ShuttleXpress for years, using it with NLEs (usually Vegas, but also MSP and others,) and love it. It is a joy to use, and it takes me back to the old linear days when I was actually working in the television industry, rather than dabbling as a hobby.<br /> My brother uses DAWs like Steinburg CuBase,so I got this as a gift for him. The price was very good, and the item was received in great condition very quickly.<br />The only potential frustration to the device is having to configure the key bindings for the particular program you are using, but most major programs already have a profile included in the drivers for the device. Normally, you install the drivers, plug in the jog wheel, launch the particular program you are using, and away you go!
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|There isn't much yo can do it it - it's kind of useless, It would be nice if it was useful in some way.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Another great installment of The Hunger Games...suspenseful and captivating. We really enjoyed it and can't wait to read the final book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If you like big numbered calculators, this is the one for you to use on your Kindle Fire or i pad or whatever because it fills the screen. Nice.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I was talking about the movie to a friend and I decided to send it to her myself. This is a perfect example of an animated movie that is definitely more for the parents than for the kids. It was funny and sad and imaginative, it makes you look at life and all the things that can happen and how it's never too late to pursue your dreams.<br />As for the kids, it's colorful and has characters that the kids will love.By the way Ed Asner was a big plus!<br />As for the item itself, arrived on time, in great shape and the price was too good to resist!
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I thought I was done with the whole Angry Birds series. After a while, the game just gets old once you figure out each level and earn three stars. This one brought me back into the series as each of the birds has new capabilities that refresh the game. Good stuff as always.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|Peck makes the subjects so interesting and very easy to read.  You leave understanding yourself and others around you that much better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read book 1 of the hunger game series a couple of years ago but I didn't care to follow up with the other two because I didn't think anything else could happen. These books are so addicting, I read the second one twice as fast as I did the first.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Wonderful series as almost everyone knows by now. I only wish there would have been more extras produced/collected for the bluray version, but having the episodes and few extras is well worth it!
B008KE3960|3.0|This is not the standard type tower defense game thats been copied again and again. Having your planes on constant move rather than stationary towers adds a fun new element to the game. It keeps drawing me back in to play more and more as its different each time based off how you move your planes.
0061689246|5.0|I am not a young adult, but I really enjoyed this book.  I read it because I had seen the movie, which I enjoyed, and I have read another of Mr. Gaiman's novels (Neverwhere).  All stories with a book and movie version will differ, and Stardust is no exception.  Most of the differences are minor, with the noteworthy exception of the ending.  In the interest of trying to not spoil either the book or the movie, I will limit my comment to the atmosphere, the feeling, that I got from the endings.<br /><br />The movie ending is sweet and romantic, the  book ending is sweet, romantic and heart-achingly poignant - to the point of verging on the melancholy.  It is tremendously more nuanced and thoughtful than the movie ending, though you may have to be older/more mature to appreciate the poignancy.  It is this more than anything that makes this book suitable for a wide range of ages.<br /><br />I am sure that to some extent my great appreciation for the ending of the book stems from the fact that I was expecting something closer to the movie, and now you won't be, but I hope that does not diminish your appreciation of Stardust.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The story is beautiful, the graphics are decent, and the puzzles are sometimes challenging. Over all a very good game.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My son loved it.  He can't wait for the other book to come out.  I would recommend this book.  Most definitely.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|whit this product you don't have to worry about the battery replacement , the only issiue was the battery clip , i have to maka a litte ajust but on the webpage this problem has been report befero
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this is a great game and my kids love it! even I play it when they get stuck. it reminds me of mario.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Good movie to watch.  Thanks Amazon for the ease of rental.  HOWEVER, whenever we pause a movie Amazon gets hung up.  EVERY TIME!!  Please fix this issue.  Thank you and have a great day!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Truly a page turner. I highly recommend reading this book because it gives us Americans a look inside the German air force. It is an easy assumption to think that the Germans were all Nazis, but oh how wrong that would be to assume that. This is a balanced and fair view of both sides, emphasizing Franz's experience more because the story would not be one without him. I learned a lot of information regarding the B17, B24, and the Mustangs...not to mention the German fighter planes. Through indescribable circumstances both sides exhibited bravery that has to be admired. This story definitely brings out the evil that was the SS and believe me these fighter guys had nothing to do with that. The book moves slowly first as you start to gather in your mind all the characters of the story, but by the middle of the book you can't put it down. Ever wondered about those restored bombers that visit the air shows? Well, read this book and you will find out how one of those bombers made it back. You will also see  a new side of the war that you may not have realized. Franz...thank you....Charlie....thank you. May the spirit of brotherhood live on.
B007REV4YI|1.0|Sucky theme song equals sucky movie. Am I the only one that thought Adele sold out! The song is terrible.<br /><br />I have to update my review. I have seen it and it had to be the worst Bond movie of all time. I didn't even watch the whole thing. I rented it on Amazon and talk about a waste of money. I want my money back. The time I don't care about since it was a snow day anyway.
B004HO6I2E|4.0|Another Funny Movie....if you like Comedy keepsyou engaged the whole movie with laughter. Again shoudl not watch with minors but funny
B004Y042N8|1.0|its fine but it gets really boring and clue gives you the whole answer so it gets  really boring just saying.<br /><br />  daddy cool out!!!!!
B002G4FQI4|5.0|I put off purchasing this album for three years(I purchased it last month) because I thought that it was primarily a cover album(which I'm not a big fan of) with only two original songs on it. However, after looking at it closer, I realized that it had more than two original songs on it.<br /><br />But actually it's a half-and-half album with 6 cover songs and 6 original songs on it. And for those who are interested in the breakdown of the songs:<br /><br />The six cover songs are:<br /><br />\\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\\"<br /><br />\\"Someday We'll All Be Free\\" (An old Donny Hathaway song.)<br /><br />\\"Nuthin' But A Party\\" (An old Roger & Zapp song which I had never heard of before and which I thought was one of the original songs on the album.)<br /><br />\\"Come In From The Cold\\"<br /><br />\\"Rainy Night In Georgia\\"<br /><br />\\"Sailing\\"<br /><br />The six original songs are:<br /><br />\\"Family Reunion\\" (Which I thought was a cover of an old O'Jay's song, but is an original song written by Rod Temperton.)<br /><br />\\"Show Me The Love\\" (Written by David Paich and Steve Lukather of the 70s/80s super-group, Toto.)<br /><br />\\"A Telephone Call Away\\" (Actually, I did a little research and found out that 1970s R&B recording star Bill Withers actually came out of retirement and wrote this song specifically for this album.)<br /><br />\\"Exotica\\" (Written by contemporary jazz super star, Marcus Miller.)<br /><br />\\"One Like You\\" (Written by legendary R&B artist, Smokey Robinson, and writer, producer, and keyboard player David Garfield.)<br /><br />\\"Living in High Definition\\" (Written by legendary writer and producer, Lamont Dozier, who is best known as being a memeber of the 1960s writing and producing team of Holland-Dozier-Holland.)<br /><br />But all 12 songs on the album, covers and originals are done very well. Also, this album is a delight to listen to.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read Bared to you & immediately bought this for my Kindle, started & finished it a few hours later. Now I have to wait months for book 3! I think it's better than Fifty Shades so if you liked that you will most likely enjoy these books. I loved and hated and loved the characters. Easy, fun, read- I cant imagine if you read Bared you wouldn't want to read this one.
B004Y6MZHC|3.0|Was disappointed when I looked at the book and it  was just a little tattered around some of the edges!
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Fun game, however when you get deep in the game, smaller balls show up. Sometimes they get stuck on the smaller balls, and can not continue. Sometimes the smaller balls can not be used, and your game is over. Highly annoying.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|For a Midwesterner, the world depicted in Downton Abbey is terra incognita.  But the acting, writing, pacing, sets and score of Downton Abbey are magnificent.  Although I have read poetry to the lords and ladies at Oxford and Grasmere, at the Royal Festival Hall, my democratic sympathies lie far more with the scheming servants.  I've just watched Season I, Season II, and the beginning of Season III on streaming video, all in a matter of three days.  I must say I was swept away.
B00846REIS|5.0|Once again I must warn you if you are looking for some deep book move on. It's a good read with great sex. It's better than fifty shades, though the characters are possibly more screwed up. Loved Gideon, loved Eva.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|no stopping in the middle. of game. I like the variety of games the music gets to me I know I can turn it off<br /><br />))
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Great acting, great story line, great everything.  I watched this one twice!  I thought the title was a description of their past relationship as well as what it really meant.  great movie!
0765325950|5.0|20 years.....and FINALLY! Gotta say, it was like the opening 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan..... for 900 pages! I couldn't put it down and read it in 2 days. I think I have PTSD after all of the carnage, but it was truly glorious and a fine ending for some fond friends. Now, I hope Harriet can find someone to give us the next set of adventures because there are some good story possibilities left to be told!
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|Series has been on a steady downhill course, but this one should finally finish it.  Waste of time unless you just have nothing else to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so happy they put it on kindle fire its the best game in the world ever.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I didn't enjoy this book as much as I did the other two, but as always, the end really got to me. I am all choked up after reading how this book ends. And I just love it.
B009IRVSVQ|1.0|With a follow up like this, Bruno peaked on his first CD. I'll be hesitant to purchase another of his CDs in the future.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I enjoy a good action movie and this is definitly one of them.The storyline was lacking. But overall a decent movie. Also renting this from amazon prime was great because it was cheaper than direct tv.
B0083Z6AH6|1.0|I could not get interested in this book, or past the style of writing.  Jane Austen is just not my cup of tea.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I had hoped I would love this as much as I do the angry birds game but I was disappointed. It just seems more difficult to play & I couldn't really get into it like I did all the angry birds games (totally addicted to those!) still have hope for more Rovio games & would love to see new Angry Bird editions!
B005HP2JAM|4.0|The 3D affect couldn't be any better. It puts into perspective the intended affects that the ancient painters drew. The documentary has been on the History Channel but this DVD makes the adventure come to life. At times the affects are jaw-dropping.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|We could not have picked a better pacifier for my granddaughter.  She no longer cries excessively because of her spitting out the pacifier.  It was the best thing I have purchased for her yet.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was in keeping with a Nicholas Sparks novel and it didn't disappoint  me.  I couldn't wait to get to the end.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This app usually works great but I feel like I don't get enough info as a seller or buyer. I know the point of an app is to do away with the &#34;extras&#34; but sometimes I feel like I'm missing info that I would really like to have. I usually end up on Safari so I can view everything. Must be my OCD nature! Lol.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|This is a must see. One of the best movies I have seen in a while. I hate buying movies but I bought this one after renting it. You'd be a fool not to watch this!
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|I have to admit I never watched Firefly on television. In fact I saw Serenity several times and I loved it. So I decided to see how it all started. This pilot was everything I expected and I look forward to the next episode.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book.  I was quite skeptical when it was recommended to me, but I read it anyway and boy and I glad.  It was v ery insightful, thoughtful, and heartwarming.  This is for everyone who is a dog lover.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I gotten to the berry level and had half of it. so wheb I got back to it I had to do the missions again. this game needs a save point.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|A very interesting view from a teenager with a troublesome life, a great incite from the author, I recommend adding this book to your library as its different from most books I read....
B00785P2QC|3.0|Super fun game. Sucks that you pretty much have to pay to play this free game.<br />If you don't mind paying for the investment credits, you will love this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun game where you dodge trains and barriers and try not to get caught by the cop and his dog. I know it says I rate it 5 stars but I rate it 100 stars.
0446580848|4.0|Big book, slow reading (it may be that I was a slow reader), lots of interesting takes on terrorism .  The book takes place in a treacherous country where John Corey and his wife, Kate Mayfield have been posted.  Lots of intrigue!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game was easy to get started and so fun to play its very cute  I'm so happy with it  I spend slot  of time playing it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a great read!!!I saw the movie but the book has so much more life!!! I can't wait to start book two!!!
B000R9RGF6|5.0|I love the 2nd song as I heard parts of it in a HP commerical.  I have this in my car CD player and enjoy this<br />everywhere I go. I find the majority of his music relaxing and calming.  There are a couple I don't like, but can skip ahead<br />to the ones I love.
0446614459|5.0|This book keeps you entertained and the ending is a surprise.  The story is about two Secret Service persons who lost the presidental candidates they were covering - different years, different places.  It takes a lot of work to put it all together, but<br />it's worth every split second!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting I can't stop playing it it's hard to put my kindle fire down
B007O4XX9K|5.0|Joe Walsh has lifted the tone of his music to a thoughtful and almost redemptive level. His battle with alcohol, so far won, is the focus of much of his life. One day at a time, Joe. You make us, your fans, happy.

0446604844|5.0|Once you start this book, you can't put it down.  First you get confused and think that someone is cheating, but that's not it.  It just gets weirder and weirder - until you get to the end and everything falls into place.  It's a great book and I loved it so much I loaned<br />it to a friend so she could enjoy it too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Was really good<br /><br />Can't wait for the other movies wish the trilogy didn't end but I'm glad with who she ended up with

B00APUYWYA|5.0|Rented this movie for a plane ride.  Loved it so much I had to buy a copy because I knew I would be watching it again and again.  Nothing unpredictable, just good story and good music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|so freaking boss!!! so addicting! why are u even reading this JUST BUY THE GOD DANG GAME!!! trust me its worth the money!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read! Different from anything I've read before, but I still found it extremely captivating. Very twisted and complex characters with interested twists throughout the entire book. Would definitely recommend it!
B009DTI3FS|5.0|Gift for my husband--he loved it.  He especially liked the company that was in the dvd. great gift for opera lovers
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|All I can say is this book had all my emotions going.. I wasn't expecting so much of what happens in this book but boy it was one hell of a ride..Sky an  Dean are prob now two of my favorite characters... this will be a top favorite book for me and will be read over again..  What an amazing author Colleen Hoover
0307887448|5.0|Really great book.  I was sucked in.  Once you start reading you can't put it down. The author writes vividly.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this app! The price was definitely right (free). The graphics and game play are sharp and very responsive. I play over and over; it is highly addictive!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|good Jack Reacher novel...&#34;suspend disbelief,&#34; as with his other adventures and just jump into it headfirst.  Less violent and bloody as many other Reacher stories.  Good reading for a cold, raw, rainy day.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I loved getting a peak into Tina Fey's mind- even if it was a snippet.  A great, quick read as well as a nice break for in between heavy or darker reads.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Just like the lost hero the first book of the series but with more kill and destroying and giant's it is so awesome
B0017XD3OY|1.0|I don't know why I bought this.  I'm sick and tired of zombies, well, sick and tired of hipster zombies.  I'd stick with Chuck Heston's &#34;Omega Man&#34; if I want to watch something like this.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I liked the premise of this book and how the author put it together, but I thought it could do with out the adult love scenes and their descriptions. That will put me off from reading most of her other novels, probably. I also thought the story kind of fell apart toward the end. I guess the main question of the novel was how much would you really love someone? Enough to kill them?<br /><br />I did think the way she started with the tragedy then went back and forth from past to present to explain how it came to be and the aftermath was a very effective way of writing this novel.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Interesting reading.  I can see the points made and have made some changes in how I eat as a result.
B003VS0CWY|5.0|everyone should have this classic for convience, fair price, delivered quickly, if you like musicals....you should own this DVD (must have), its just nice to have it whenever you want to watch.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I don't like many games outside Angry Birds, but this one has me completely intrigued. Fun, nice to look at, interesting variety - what's not to love?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I hope E L James decides to keep on writting.  She REALLY knows what a women is looking for in a good book.  Maybe a little racy for some, but I think on some level most women would appreciate this trilogy.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|What can I say?  My daughter and I watched Gilmore Girls together as she was growing up.  Even my husband kinda got hooked!
B001JRB16U|5.0|classic that you must have, delivered quickly, price is right, if you like julie andrews you will love this calssic that everyone should see.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I got these a year ago as a birthday present from my daughter and have practically worn them every day, everywhere. Am getting ready to buy a second pair in the same color, olive. They go with everything. Very comfortable, true to size, well constructed. And the best part is knowing that a child somewhere will get a pair of shoes.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put these books down.  I am now going back and reading then for a second time just in case I missed something.  Where in the world is MY Cristian Grey????  HaHa
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This was an action packed movie with great acting and an interesting premise. It fell a little short of the other movies in the Bourne series, maybe because the plot points felt a bit rushed. Still worth watching, and I recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Good book.  I learned a little bit about a time in history I had never given much thought to.  I am rarely satisfied with the ending of a book, but this time it just seemed right.  I like the way Stephen King always incorporates places and characters from his previous works.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|easy to pick up but hard to put down  Ads are annoying in the free version, but not enough to bring the rating down
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Its not as good as The Dark Knight but it is a pretty good flick. The ending seemed a little forced, like he was trying to tie everything up, but it made sense.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|heard some mixed reviews, for anybody who heard that it was not as good as the other two- don't listen to that. it was very good.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It seems to work just fine.it's nice to know how much time you have and for what. It gives a good description of what kind of battery life you have as well as a nice visual.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After stumbling upon, and then reading, the first book in the Wool saga I was hooked. I purchased and read the first five books then wrote this review, then bought book six. Excited to see where the story goes from here and to look into some of Howeys' other series.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I had some issues with my case and called LifeProof Support.  When I gave them the serial number I was informed that the item was a fake.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|*As seen on Goodreads*<br /><br />Actual rating: 4.5<br /><br />Oh boy. What to say?<br /><br />I have a few wishes and I think they may speak to where my head is at with respect to this novel.  This should have, would have been five stars except for the following:<br /><br />#1.  I wish this author was represented by a good publisher.<br />#2.  I wish this book fell into the hands of a solid editor.<br /><br />Okay, now that that's out of the way.  Let me say that Hopeless ran me over like a heard of bulls in Pamplona.  There was so much happening that I felt emotionally trampled by the end.  I WILL NOT reveal the twist, as so much of the story relies on it, but I will say that WOW, um, didn't exactly see that coming.  And that's a good thing, in my book.  Sky and Holder are simply fantastic.  I loved them individually and collectively, as a couple.  Flawed and fractured, imperfect, they were a joy to get to know.<br /><br />What this novel did need was a better edit.  There were scenes that should have been trimmed, transitions which were bumpy, and the novel itself should have been condensed a bit.  BUT, it was so worth the read and has renewed my faith in Indie authors.  So, thank you Colleen Hoover for giving me something I've been missing for quite a long while: a truly fantastic story, with great characters, from an Indie author.  I hope this book gets picked up, treated with the respect it deserves and pushed out into the world.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good story, it kept you interested. Suspenseful. I think anyone would enjoy reading this book. A read for young and<br /> old.
B000YDE43C|5.0|These are some of the lightest and rugged boots I've had. Styling is also great. I am very satisfied with them.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I had stopped reading Grisham, as the stories became predictable and endings weak. After reading some of the previous reviews I decided to give this book a chance. The story line was fresh and fun. The twists and turns that ultimately lead to the conclusion made this book a page turner reminiscent of the Grisham of old. Welcome back John and keep up the good work!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|*As seen on Goodreads*<br /><br />I read this on the heels of Hopeless and while I enjoy that story more, Slammed was still a wonderful read and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Colleen Hoover really knows how to create dialogue and seems quite talented at crafting compelling characters.  Lake and Will are, at times, hysterical, they are thoughtful and kind, they are introspective and vulnerable.  I wanted to hug them both when their relationship hit the wall.  It was agonizing.  What was nice, however, is that I understood their motivation, however stupid or silly their reactions were, and that's a testament to Colleen Hoover's writing prowess.  Slammed very easily could have devolved into an angst-fest.  But it didn't.  And regardless of how juvenile Lake sometimes acted, it was appropriate and never taken too far.  What also bears mentioning is that Colleen Hoover has an exceptional way of balancing the soft and hard elements of her characters.  Let me explain.  She allows them to ache and yearn and hurt, but gives them a sense of humor and sarcasm which is lovely.  I laughed out loud at their antics and dialogue in one moment, and ached for them the next.  It was really exceptionally and tastefully done.<br /><br />In addition, secondary characters like Kel, Caulder, Eddie and Lake's mom are really well crafted.  They helped flesh out the storytelling and offered a means by which to know our primary characters better.  Too often, these kinds of characters get lost in the storytelling, but that simply isn't the case with Slammed.  Each voice was disctinct and individual, each person unique.  I adored getting to know them.<br /><br />My favorite parts were the slams, which allowed the reader to really get inside Will's head.  I loved it.  What an interesting and refreshing concept, one that was skillfully done.  I adored how Colleen Hoover incorporated these dialogues into the book, allowing us to share these feelings, while offering us a new perspective on self-examination.  It truly was amazing.<br /><br />Why it lost a star for me: it wasn't flawless.  There were some choppy transitions and elements which could and should have been more deeply explored.  There were also some grammatical issues, but I've forgiven those.  Lastly, there was a shift in Lake's mom's attitude toward Will which was neither explained or explored.  Why she drifted so dramatically from adamant and staunch refusal to allow Lake and Will to foster their relationship to utter acceptance of it, was a bit unbelievable.  I understand her trepidation and reticence, I would feel that way too, so why the reversal in thinking?  It seems a simple enough thing to explain, just a paragraph or two would have sufficed, I think.  It just wasn't there and it bugged the crap out of me.<br /><br />In any event, read Slammed.  It was good, really, really good.  And Will Cooper is now one of my favorite boys.ion.  It truly was amazing.<br /><br />Why it lost a star for me: it wasn't flawless.

B007WFTFG6|3.0|Got this for my grandson, he loves the part he can color.  Ya'll should let people know up front that only ONE section will open on the FREE part and you have to pay to open the other coloring sections.  Children don't understand why it won't open.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I LOVE this movie and was very happy to have been able to obtain another copy.<br />I think we have watched this 3-4 times since receiving it.  What a great movie.
B006CQLGXG|3.0|I have not had time to read this book yet. I will be glad to review it when I have read it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very entertaining, great storyline and excellent acting!  Maggie Smith is, as always, just perfect!  And the house is so beautiful...  One could watch the show just for that alone.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|Very easy to look up something on-the-go.  I recommend it highly for a quick reference or need to know something in casual conversation.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A really good read, plenty for us techies to absorb, great characterization , and tackled in a unique self narrated/daily log perspective that works really well. Others have complained about bad language use but it seems to me that it fits right in, is entirely justified and even enhances the story. And it's not as prevalent as others make it out to be.. I'm sure real astronauts swear too.<br /><br />Really enjoyed the book it was one I had difficulty putting done... Now... Next book please Andy.
B0084BMUFA|3.0|I have not had time to read this book. I will review it when I have read it. I like how simple it is to add books to my Kindle Fire.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|Bought this for our oldest daughter and she cannot say enough about how much she loves this whole CD.  It is all she has played since receiving it and it came to us in record delivery time.
1118109791|2.0|While the questions presented in this book are excellent (they're former GMAT questions), aside from that the book is garbage.  I struggled to work through this book for several weeks before switching to the Kaplan GMAT Premier 2013, a much better guidebook.  The struggle was not with the questions; I would say the questions are of equal difficulty in both books.  Rather, the Official Guide for GMAT Review is just unpleasant to use and read.  If you absolutely want a source of guaranteed past GMAT questions, it is an excellent resource to that end.  However, for an introduction to the structure of the test and a review of the principles covered there a much more user-friendly alternatives available.
0061124265|5.0|Great book. Makes you do some soul searching. Would highly recommend.Truly well written. Love Coelho. This is my favorite book from him
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game rocks I totally recommend it it is awesome<br />I love how you get to be in different areas and have people who don't stay for ever.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Quality DVD's have already been watched multiple times with no problems and received on time with no problems.  Great price too.
B004UID2LC|5.0|i dont know what these people are talking about. i freaking love this app! i love being able to download videos!!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I so enjoyed this movie. I didn't watch the other Bourne movies. I had read the books and the movie adaptations were too divergent for me. I wanted Richard Chamberlain's Bourne, but time and technology had made him obsolete. So, I watched this movie, without any expectations, because I had heard that it was good. To me, it was great. Personally, I am sick and tired of \\"loner\\" movies; sick and tired of the lone husband or lone wife whom we're supposed to empathize with in his or her quest for revenge. What we get for our empathy are lots of special effects, CGI, high body counts and the tiresome one-liners, with the hero or heroine as unfulfilled when the movie is over as he or she was when it began.<br /><br />Give me a Neo and Trinity pairing any day (The Matrix); a movie where the man and woman need each other to survive and have that special mixture of chemistry between them to make them overwhelmingly watchable. Hence, Renner and Weisz are what I loved best about this movie.  They were so natural together. They were two people working together against all the adversaries in this story, for one simple goal: helping each other to stay alive.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the science that created the bionic men and women, the scenes in Alaska and in Manila, especially when Weisz had to look after Renner.  I didn't want this movie to end. I was disappointed to see there was no sequel already in the works. I only hope some smart director will pair those two people in another movie that's worth seeing.
B006PW0F52|5.0|Another great book that helps us understand and apply behavioral finance in our daily lives. Especially useful in a business context and gives a real insight into the way people are programmed. the good and the bad
B005S9EJ14|3.0|It was OK but a bit stoic.  I will watch it again someday but not a great movie so not I a hurry
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Afraid I couldn't take this boook as proof of anything except the author's experience of an altered state of consciousness, not generally experienced or recognized by medical folks.  A curious and interesting tale, raising many questions, not so full of answers.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very well written and suspenseful! Like that it is a murdery mystery through the eyes of the characters, not the cops.
B002RI9QJE|5.0|Great book that explains the rationality behind seemingly irrational decisions. Great application for money managers which helps me understand our clients and my own behavior
B009K0P10K|5.0|My husband and I couldn't wait for Season2  We were mesmerized by Season 1. You never know what (or who) Emily will do next.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I wanted to know what my kids were reading.  Easy, simple, enjoyed the elements of politics .... overall very entertaining.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the game! It makes you think and focus on how to get your eggs back while having fun.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|I've not purchased music from the current selection of musicians, \\"don't know why\\". That being said, I can't wait to see this Musician/Man/Brother in concert! Without a doubt I'll be buying \\"Be Good\\", \\"Water\\" and should his followup music be of this caliber I'll be buying them too. Gregory Porter collection here I come!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Wanted to read what my kids were reading.  My son thought this book was boring and moved to slow (he is 12) After reading it I found the book filled with twists and turns - political undertones everywhere.  I do agree some parts dragged and I would have preferred a different ending.  Overall I was entertained and could see how my son might have been a bit bored.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Didn't agree with all the hype about this book.  Too unbelievable - not the sex,  but the story line.  Just means my sex life is already great.
B00785P2QC|4.0|If you like the build and manage your own city types of games, this game is for you!  The only thing I would recommend for this game is that everything wasn't so expensive.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The animation in this feature length movie is really beautiful and fun.  For me the movie spoke on a myriad of topics. From children learning to be polite, to adults respecting private property, and youth's need to overcome their fears and take responsibility for themselves and others.  The plot can be confusing, but take the time to get into it and it will make sense.  I had more fun on the second viewing because I was able to appreciate all the little foreshadowing details.
B00004I9Q9|1.0|Was very disappointed, it did not work.. Waste of time and money. Would never order used movies again. Hope I receive a credit.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this same alarm clock for all of my android devices. the program allows you to turn off/snooze in a variety of ways like having to shake it or do math problems. love it!
B0097AQEOK|5.0|I went from being mildly familiar with the work of Joni Mitchell to being one of her biggest fans! This box set covers most of her best work!
B004I744AS|5.0|Awesome. I am French speaker and before using this application I had a hard time to find the exact word that could express correctly my ideas. But now all I have to do is to enter the word I am looking for in my native language and I have the translation of it and it's meaning in context. What else? I have all I want.
B005I6EU48|5.0|This case feels amazing to hold, has an extra pocket on the foldout side, isn't stiff at all, holds the kindle snug and secure, and is by far one of my favorite purchases for my Kindle Fire. Would recommend to anyone looking for a Kindle case.
B002ZG983M|5.0|REALLY great product. Plays great, sounds great, looks great. All professional, inside and out. Plus, this movie means a lot to me so wanted it to be perfect. And it is.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Top ten reasons you wouldn't watch this production:<br />1. You're not the brightest crayon in the box<br />2. You're not the sharpest knife in the drawer<br />3. You don't care for excellent screenwriting<br />4. Outstanding acting bores you<br />5. Sumptuous costuming, sets, and locations don't suit your personal aesthetic<br />6. Bridging the concept of all people from all walks of life and all eras have many of the same life issues doesn't pertain to you<br />7. You can't understand why anyone with the name &#34;Lady Violet&#34; would be appealing to a smart, smarmy, fashionable clod such as yourself<br />8. You don't like period pieces<br />9. You don't speak or understand British<br />10. No one as hip and current as you would be caught dead watching BBC or PBS
B005LAII80|5.0|Great movie and worth the few dollars to own a hardcopy. Thirlby and Urban make a great pair of ass-kicking future cops.
1935670913|5.0|Very informative and gives a real inside look as to how he sells his books. Very honest too. Bottom Line of the book's message -- It takes a lot of persistence to be a successful writer.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Having put off watching this series for years, I caught the first one on cable a few weeks ago and was hooked.  Monsters, sci-fi, end of the world, females kicking rears, huge action scenes?  Why did i miss out?  So I purchased the first four Blu-ray discs in a set.  I loved them all.  Sure, some were a little ridiculous, but overall, I see myself playing them on a slow day (snow day? rain day? etc).  I watched the Extinction and Afterlife back to back,...<br /><br />...and then I rented Retribution immediately after finishing the  Afterlife.<br /><br />Retribution is terrible.  For one, it's maybe 80 minutes long, and nothing much really happens to move the story along.  Sure, i get that it was a device to advance some characters in the story, introduce a few more, and introduce the Las Plagas parasite.  But, really, at most this should have been a 1-hour animation.  A straight-to-DVD special release of some sort.  An animated Webisode released prior to the release of the next one.  I mean, to be honest, most of this could have been covered during the intro to the next installment in about ten or fifteen minutes, or as back flashes.<br /><br />Retribution came off as a cheap attempt at milking fans for more money.  Highly disappointed.
B001GF8WPI|4.0|I ordered this as a Christmas present when she went to watch it opened case and it was empty it appeared that the security label was cut and then the case re-shrink wrapped.. Amazon promptly sent a new one that came in perfect condition would have been 5 stars had i not gone thought the disappointment of my girlfriend not getting to watch it when she wanted to.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a great follow up to book one in the series through the terrible and tumultuous of 1933 to 1947 and all the families involved
B005LAIISA|3.0|I really think they should have left off with the release of the third one.  This one went a bit over the edge to the land of &#34;For little kids only.&#34;  What was with all the nursery school music?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved every second of this book! Colleen Hoover is an amazing writer!! I finished this book in less than 24 hours, couldn't put it down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. The suspense was great as was the entire book. Cannot wait to see the movie now.
B002GIBVV6|4.0|This movie is a cute movie for our 10 year old daughter. It's sad happy and inspirational all in one.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|so...this review is going to definitely poke a hole in the big ballon of awesome reviews I read before reading this book. This review is also going to contain some spoilers so here is your chance to not spoil the story and also read it and form your own opinion as mine clearly differs from most others. Also I'm 30, so maybe to a younger reader this story would have been better (though it was recommended to me by people my age) so here's your chance to miss spoilers...<br /><br />1<br /><br />2<br /><br />3<br /><br />I liked this book in the beginning. The friendship between Sky and Six appealed to me. I liked their bond and the movies and the ice cream. I liked Holder at first and appreciated the foreshadowing that he knew Sky, but we didn't know how.<br /><br />I wish Six would've been a bigger role. She was cool and the kind of friend I would like to have.<br /><br />Now. Sky. First of all, the way she talked combined with her inner monologue just irritated me. There was a point when she was running when she used the phrase \\"texas heat\\" over and over. We get it. You live in Texas. It's hot. Also the use of the word hopeless throughout the book. Over and over... this hopeless boy this...this hopeless boy that...we get it. The name of the book is Hopeless.<br /><br />With that said, the meaning behind the tattoo was cool. I liked that it was a combination of Sky & Holder's sister.<br /><br />I felt like way too much happened in way too short amount of time. Maybe I've forgotten the innocence of young love and how fast you can fall. It just seemed absolutely insane to me that in two months time this much drama could take place.  Also I don't understand the amount of bullying Sky experienced at school. It's never indicated that Six is bullied or picked on, so why is Sky treated as such? Furthermore how is her reputation even known when she doesn't have any access to social networking?<br /><br />Holder is completely unbelievable, in my opinion. He is clearly written by a woman. I sometimes had a hard time distinguishing his voice from Sky's. He cries too much, he compliments too much. Holder is just too much. Also coming in her window uninvited? I know Edward Cullen did the same thing. I felt like this story was trying to imitate the relationship between Edward Cullen and Bella Swan, but failed miserably.<br /><br />As far as the child abuse / kidnapping issue... good idea, but poorly executed. I suggest reading Gillian Flynn's novels for a true dark twist. Alice Hoffman also writes dark very well. The Story Sisters is an excellent example.<br /><br />I was bored with Sky, Holder, their weird sex, and the redundancy by the time I reached 70% on my kindle. I'm sorry. I respect the writer and good for her that she has so many positive reviews. I wish I had one for her and I will probably give her another chance because anyone who listens to the Avett Brothers can't be all bad...however, this book disappointed me.by a woman.

B004IFYMYI|5.0|Great price.  Taxi Driver got the treatment it deserves. Cool packaging, comes with movie shots from the film.  Recommend to any fan. BluRay comes out surprisingly well.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Met my needs. I was satisfied with the contents of this book and seller was very prompt with delivery. Book was in excellent condition.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This was probably the best book in the trilogy. I think it was very action packed in the ending. It was a very swag ending for this series. Yolo
B002LAM7PI|5.0|creepy yet cute. more for adults i would say. probably would scare the crap outta little kids haha a a
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game has let me kill creepers like a boss and play co op with my little brother and sneak up on him and make him angry when I kill him
B006ATJXQW|3.0|It was a good book. It had a good ending to this book. It was a swag book homie. Yolo
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What can one say of one of the highrst grossing movie's of the last few years. If you dont own it, go buy it now!
B000F7CMQ8|3.0|I'm a big fan of this film for its guilty pleasures and would like to give it 5 stars for my personal enjoyment but that wouldn't do justice to the true John Ford classics.  This one is dynamite but, truthfully,  3 1/2 stars is more like it. This is  a corny potboiler \\"movie movie\\" where bridled loins and unbridled passion meet with great star power.  Grace Kelly is smokin' as the repressed English wife/marm of a sincere but dull Brit.  But Ava Garder as a brassy urban night-lifer dropped in the middle of East Africa to keep the party goin' steals the show.  Polar opposites, the two of them orbit around macho Clark Gable's big game hunter, everyone lusting for someone or something.  And since the grass is always greener and he is a hunter after all, Gable is less interested in Ava's easy virtue than Kelly's cool chastity.  John Ford rarely, if ever, did the romantic/sex thing to this extent (though John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara do steam it up in a few) but he goes the distance here.  Set in a sweaty dangerous jungle full of hot and humid eyes and bodies, and toss in a gorilla hunt for added symbolism.........good stuff.  Conformity of 1950s marriages are challenged here by Hollywood non-comformists so the general population didn't have to.  The trailer is hilarious for all the references to the smoldering African atmosphere.  Nothing to take seriously but well crafted period piece with mercurial John Ford at the helm.  Good price for an atypical Ford collectible
B0097RF3X6|5.0|Karen Souza has a very expressive musicianship and also, a velvet voice capable to convey the listener the very core of the song.<br /><br />Her performance of Paris, for instance is an invitation; on the other hand she displays an intense version of I heard it through a grapevine, but the pearl of the crown is -to my mind- her version My foolish heart, touching and warm.<br /><br />I recommend this album (one of the top albums of 2012, indeed) without reserves. Go for it, please!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a great read and I would higly recommend reading it.  I couldn't put it down.  Loved the characters,
0525953728|5.0|Book was a real quick read but very insightful, as a prior service member I could understand  the frustration they faced.
B005M92MJ6|1.0|Purchased using my Phone, So the (clean) didn't show on my screen. Waste of Money. There should be a way to swap it out with the actual album instead of the EDITED \\"(clean)\\" version. Don't take this review the wrong way, the album is great, just the way it was presented on the mobile side was wrong.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was a very good book, I loved the story and was sad when it ended.  I would recommend it highly.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie was entertaining, original and well made!  JGL did an amazing job reproducing Bruce Willis's mannerisms and speech-isms.  It really made you believe he was a younger Willis.  Do not pass this movie by!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I bought this album on a whim because it was only $3.99 and it ended up being a fantastic decision. I couldn't be more impressed.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|Tried playing this with my son last night.  The configurations shown on the cards are impossible to build.  The plastic pieces are not well designed.  The gray ones have warped edges (how can you stack things that aren't flat??) and they all have deep ridges on the side.  Why would you not design the pieces to be perfectly flat?  What should have been a fun activity with my son turned into me screaming at the pieces, giving up, and telling my son to pick another game to play because this one is too frustrating.<br /><br />If you are looking to buy an Angry Birds game for a child, I recommend the Jenga Angry Birds Death Star game.  It's well designed, easy to set up, and very fun to play.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Excellent family film.  We enjoyed it very much.  Great christian content, I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for good family entertainment.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Meryl Streep does an excellent portrayal of an elderly lady fighting dementia and Jim Broadbent plays the role of her husband brilliantly.  Had I expected a film about dementia I would've gotten what I expected however the balance of the film concentrates on that rather than the accomplishments and career of Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br />Reverse that balance and you have an excellent film to go along with the great acting.
B007LB2B3K|4.0|My new band is covering two of the songs from this album.  Really like Still Counting.  (We are also covering Fallen)
B001N474LU|5.0|What can I say?  Pacino in just about anything is great and John Cusack was brilliant!  Great, great, great.  Just added the greats because if you review you have to have a number of words....really now.
1573225517|2.0|1. It is very original; 2. Biting wit and numerous laugh out loud moments; 3. Several pop music and movie references; 4. Startlingly accurate depictions of male post-breakup pathos; 5. Numerous London colloquialisms let us know how they live and speak in England.<br />I absolutely loved this novel. It was witty, exploring with a keen eye relationships and the reasons why men and women get together, and sometimes drift apart.<br /><br />'this is so nothing'  yes i know hes successful......
B008MM9630|5.0|I think fairy farm is a great game it reminds me of tinker bell and her fairy friends and I just love the game.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I have purchased this product before; so I knew this was a good product.<br /><br />High quality and works great. It was shipped quickly.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry birds always reliable fun,just isn't long enough! Always fun,the puzzle quality  is awesome! These guys really are very creative in there ability to set up great challenges in clearing out the evil pigs!  loved their rendition of the star wars characters!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Sadly I was unable to see Episode 3 of Downton Abbey on Sunday - but thanks to Amazon I didn't miss out on all that happened. Now Next Sunday I won't feel a little lost because I missed part of it.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book was just that. Entertaining. I never particularly felt like going out of my way to read it, but when I had a few minutes to kill, it was something good to kill it with. I felt it was short and the story didn't really get to evolve to its full extent.
B004FOA84A|4.0|You must go through and figure out you next move and then find the next puzzle and how to open it.I liked it for that reason,you had to find it all blindly no cheats.For anyone who likes to figure things out themselves and not too difficult.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Told from Dog's POV, this book is absolutely amazing. It's full of wonderful little moments that life throws us, as well as, the hard times that we all encounter. Racing in the Rain is hard for a driver, and life is too. Dogs know stuff.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series give you something to discuss with others who are also watching.  I love the dialogue and guessing what will happen next.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The cover works great.  I can take my Kindle with me everywhere and not worry about it getting wrecked.  I would recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|wow this was long, but i love, love, love it. it's classic Stephen King writing, with a twist. He uses the premise to the utmost!
B004RZGUBM|5.0|The main benefit of Kindle format over paper print is the ready opportunity for finding passages and characters and sayings in the one consise place. I have wondered if the Kindle format would have been as much appreciated by me had I not read the books in print beforehand. Would I have bothered? I perhaps cannot answer that because mine is a generational experience.<br />I have read Dickens my whole life. In my view he is  exceptional because I have merely ventured into about less than half his works, and I regard that as commendable.<br />In summary, if you have Charles Dickens as a member of your heratige and family, the complete works in Kindle format is literally wonderful. I have shown it to friends  and even stored bundles of books in my cellar to unclutter our book shelf. It is a useful and generous product.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|A one-day read that makes you wish you had the willpower to have stretched it out and savored it. This sexy soap opera keeps it coming (pun intended!), page after page. I can't wait until book #3 is released.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|Great movie. I guess it was made in the 1950's and it's got some politically incorrect moments, but I will always love it, and little kids/toddlers love it too.  Beautiful art, story, & songs.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Twisted conveluted plot. Really drug at times, wanted to just turn pages to get somewhere. Just not typical Grisham. First several chapters very good. Last several chapters ok. Grisham can do great stories, this is just is not one of them.

B004JZBGWI|3.0|I got a new Kindle and quickly started downloading a bunch of apps and books.  I downloaded this app and realized it wasn’t for me.  It bored me very quickly.  I downloaded the important ones from Amazon’s library and am content with what I have.  Not for me…but maybe you’ll like it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|A Storm of Swords if full of it all: action, heartbreak, tragedy, compelling characters and the growth of characters we already know. Those who have read it of course know that the climax of the book is the Red Wedding and that portion of the book is so beautifully written that I could feel every moment as I was reading and my heart was beating fast through all of it.

B004NS710C|4.0|This was a fun movie with a great cast. If you are a railroader you'll love the locomotive and train action and great sound, however be warned: not everything pictured is real or correct in the realm of train handling or locomotive operation. You will probably find yourself yelling at the screen, but that's half the fun of these types of movies! Even though the heroes are railroaders it also makes some of them look like rubes and highlights unsafe actions. So be prepared for certain stereotypes and be ready to explain to your friends and family that no, not all of us act like that at or do things like this at work.

B0041B785Y|5.0|Meshuggah has been one of my favorite bands for a while. This album sits right up there with the bands best. They're continuing to evolve, and refining their sound, with each release sounding less and less like almost anything else out there. Still manages to sound distinctively Meshuggah though. A sound many may find confusing, with all of the dissonance, and bizarre time signatures only previously used by Cthulhu's favorite band. If you liked the last couple albums, you'll almost certainly enjoy this as well. I think they're definitely a love 'em or hate 'em band. Don't see many people sitting on the fence, saying \\"they're okay....\\". You'll either think they're horrible, or they'll be your new religion.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|Just because it’s free doesn’t mean it’s worth downloading.  I got a new Kindle and quickly started downloading a bunch of apps, books, music, etc.  This one is not for me…but maybe you’ll like it.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I got a new Kindle and quickly started downloading a bunch of apps and books.  I downloaded this app and I like it.  I downloaded the important ones from Amazon’s library and am content with what I have.  It is easy to use and gives me what I need, when I need it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait to see the movie. A lot of surprises in this book. Very well done, I loved it.
B007JMW46U|3.0|I started reading this book and became bored.  It is not for me but you may like it.  It is free so give it a shot.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you loved the first one you'll love this one too. I can't wait for the next book. Highly recommended
B004VMUS9G|3.0|Just because it’s free doesn’t mean it’s worth downloading.  I got a new Kindle and quickly started downloading a bunch of apps, books, music, etc.  This one is not for me…but maybe you’ll like it.
1455502626|1.0|John Cory is a macho, sex obsessed, obnoxious, smart alec, disgusting cop.  He's also a case of arrested development, with the mind of a high school sophomore who spent most of his time in the bathroom.  In between making insulting or boorish comments to, or about, everyone he meets, There are pages and pages of drivel; pointless conversations or observations on nothing anyone would want to waste time with.  I don't know how the book ends.  I don't even care; it ended for me when I cheerfully tossed it into the recycle bin.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I got this app free, so how bad can it be.  I am looking forward to using it, as quite a few of my work documents are compatible with this program.  No complaints here.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|My favorite tv show this and last season. I Watched it on Netflix and just had to get this seasons!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the trilogy of the Hunger Games. It was something different!  I would recommend this as a good read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book is masterpiece from a most capable author. It held my attention<br />from the very beginning to the unexpected ending. Although I found the plot<br />to be definitely heart-breaking, I am amazed at the author's understanding<br />of human nature.<br /><br />Lois
B005LAIISU|5.0|It arrived just in time to download for our holiday travel. We saw it in a theater and requested the item as a gift.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved these books.  I thought I would just read a few pages and quit, but that only continued on until I still want more.
B0064BCNA4|4.0|My little one loves to play music on this.  I like the different instruments you can make it sound like and he loves following the lit up keys on the programmed in music.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|This movie is just okay. I didn't see part 1, so the cast of former movie & tv heroes was the most interesting part for me. It had few funny lines.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am using a kindle fire and I have not encountered any problems using this app that other people say they have.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. As is usually the case, it was not as good as the first one, but has several fun twists.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Still a hit with me and my grand babies.  They were so excited watching this movie, and had a lot of questions after it was over.  I would recommend this movie to my friends and family.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|How can this even be rated? It's a classic masterpiece, and you can't beat the price! (it was free on my kindle)
B0090EHVMC|5.0|5 Star because of it's content and beautiful picture.  I really liked this movie and would recommend it to friends.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Hours of great brain fun! Makes you think while having a great time. Can't think of a cheaper way to stretch my synapses.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|My Granddaughter absolutely loved this movie.  She couldn't watch it enough.  Very kid friendly as well as learning lesson for those very intriguing little ones.  Thank you
B003VR5PPY|4.0|First let me say why not a Full 5 star rating.<br />For 2 significant reasons.<br />1)You have to beat this game at least twice,if you want to see the final denouement.This is a bummer for people who want to play a game only once.<br />2)The dialogues drag a little too much in the middle of the game.Sometimes the chatting seems arbitrary.<br />Aside from these above mentioned factors,the Game is excellent.<br />It will constantly keep you guessing to finish puzzles,down to the nail-biting conclusion at the End.<br />It seems Funny how big budget holly wood style presentation games on Consoles,falter in terms of storytelling,and weaving decent plots.<br />If you are in this game for a Story that will knock your socks off.You have come to the right place.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This was a great mystery as far as &#34;who done its&#34; go. However, Cornwell is going a little stale with her characters, and they all have such a lack of insight into their own motivations that I'm surprised they succeeded in their professions!
0920668372|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter because I remember reading it when I was a kid. The book is great quality with a wonderful story, of course.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I can not draw, but found out neither can other players. :)<br />It is fun to just goof around with for awhile.<br />It is too easy to cheat...like writing the word instead of drawing.  When my &#34;Random&#34; opponents do that, I have to quit playing because it takes the fun out of it.  Saying that, the scores do not mean much. Somone could be cheating the whole time and gain a lot of points.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read the whole series over the holiday.....loved it and didn't want it to end. Yes, it was a little sexy but the love story and adventure was what really peaked my interest. Read it, you'll love it!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app personally. It is an awesome fun game to play. It does get boring after a while though. I perfer it for your kids.
B005LAII80|5.0|after being disappointed with the Sylvester Stallone version of this film i was a bit hesitant at first about seeing this retelling of Dredd. but from the very first scene to the final one this film does not disappoint. the disc comes loaded with tons of extras & behind the scenes featurettes. both the 3D and 2D versions are on the same disc and will play on any blu-ray player so you don't need to worry if you don't own a 3D-HDTV setup. main audio is<br />7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio **Optimized for 11.1 Neo: X Playback**
0345803507|5.0|You know what, EL James did her research, that's all I have to say.  So many reviews have been written on this series that all I can say is &#34;FREED&#34; might be how EL James describe it; I think it was the beginning of &#34;CAPTIVITY&#34; but only the good kind.  What else can they do...they certainly lived a full life in such a short period of time.  Brilliantly written with intrigue, fun, pain, love, hate, suspense and way too much sex...I don't want to hear it, you got to take a break sometime!  I think a good book series should end, and end well it did.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great way to catch up on missed episodes.  Love the show.  Looking forward to viewing the next episode of Downton Abbey.
0345803485|5.0|You know what, EL James did her research, that's all I have to say.  So many reviews have been written on this series that all I can say is don't start if you don't have time to finish!  Brilliantly written with intrigue, fun, pain, love, hate, suspense and way too much sex.  I don't want to hear it, you got to take a break sometime!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a version of Pictionary which I always loved.  I don't think they are really related, but that is the closest way for me to describe it.  Love it!
0345803493|5.0|You know what, EL James did her research, that's all I have to say.  So many reviews have been written on this series that all I can say is &#34;it's DARKER&#34; before the dawn.  Brilliantly written with intrigue, fun, pain, love, hate, suspense and way too much sex.  I don't want to hear it, you got to take a break sometime!
B00B0TP1P4|5.0|I thought it was a really great episode and the fact who Eli has chosen as his lawyer is such a good idea.  I can hardly wait to see what happens next. Haven't decided on Knight yet.  I like him but...
B00005JKZV|3.0|Ordered all 3 movies...we never watched and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. The movie came quick and in great condition...but the movies were cheesy and a Harry Potter storyline rip off
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a phenomenal series of books. The 3rd is so informative and well written. I recommend that every person read the entire series.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|While the intense subject matter held promise for a moving story, it was a huge let down.  Just skip it!
B0059DL0UC|3.0|If you have exercised regularly for awhile or taken any amount of time to understand the musculature in your body, this book is a review only. Nothing new.  For a person looking to learn the basics, it is a great start.
B0000012VG|5.0|Claudio Abbado, to my knowledge, is the only major conductor to record entire non-opera recordings devoted to Mussorgsky.  This is his third such recording, although all the works on this recording are re-recordings that Abbado made earlier for RCA and DG.<br /><br />Abbado seems to have a preference for the original version of Night on Bald Mountain, rather than the more common Rimsky-Korsakov arrangement of the work.  The original version is quite different from the re-orchestrated version, and Mussorgsky has some interesting ideas.  The structure of the tone-poem in Mussorgsky's hands in quite loose and episodic, and it is clear why Rimsky-Korsakov felt that he needed to re-orchestrate it. I just wish, however, that Rimsky-Korsakov would have used more of Mussorsky's unique tonal palette in his orchestration.<br /><br />The four choral pieces on this disk are all short, pleasant, and well worth hearing. The sequence of the pieces make for a very satifying whole.<br /><br />The real reason to buy this disk, however, if for Ravel's orchestration of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. Abbado recorded it earlier in 1981 with the London Symphony, and his interpretation had changed little when this recording was made.  Compared to the 1986 version by Karajan with this orchestra, Abbado is more poetic and less dramatic than Karajan. The performance is very satifying in its own right, even though it lacks the \\"wow\\" factor of the Karajan recording.<br /><br />The live recordings are warm, with great impact where appropriate.  The bass drum and the tam-tam in Pictures are superbly caught.<br /><br />I slightly prefer the Karajan in Pictures, but this certainly a fine alternative.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Ordered this as a gift for a Harry Potter fan.  My friend absolutely loved it.  Movies play as they should with clean, crisp picture.<br /><br />Small price to make someone very happy!!!!
034580404X|5.0|Now this trilogy was awesome/scary/sexy/stimulating/unimaginable----very good page turner. Would love for this to be made into a movie!! No more words......
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|My daughter ordered this and loves it!  She is very particular about her money and this was well spent.  Great quality!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|truthfully all it is, is mobile facebook there really isn't anything grand or super about this app it's just bland boring facebook
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a book club selection and for me it began a little slow but once I was into it further, I really couldn't put it down. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy read although it was a tad disturbing also. I can not wait for my Club to review of Gone Girl.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Just finished moments ago. While I had been anticipating the end from the beginning, I never wanted this story to end. So creatively told.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Started off as  a slow read. But once I got into it I could not put it down. The end just made me want the second book right away. Great read! Very extensive vocabulary too, learned some new words.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I couldn't put it down!! It was heart felt and full of factual information that doesn't confuse a reader who does not have  degree in neuroscience
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Love this game, make sure you have a lot of time because  you can t just play one level.  Makes you think about what your next move will be.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy being able to view different translations and this makes it easy to switch back and forth.to make comparisons.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I haven't completed the book yet, but it is just as good as his other books.  I am loving it!!!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I prefer something with substance and a plot.  I didn't realize what I was getting when I ordered it.  Will definitely do better research in the future.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This is a true classic, and should definitely be in everyone's kindle library.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I look forward to re-reading it every Christmas!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My kids loved the movie, my husband and I enjoyed it as well.. It was funny and kept my kids attention the whole movie..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought I would never find another epic story after reading Harry potter. But Hunger Games is amazing! It has Acton romance and drama and suspense. I can't wait to read the next book ! I highly recommend people to read this book.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|What can you say about it.  It's the original Star Wars, enhanced.  Need I say anything more, somethings are perfect!!
B004NROYUI|5.0|An excelent leather case for the fujiX100. It is well made and protects the camera. Foolish not to have a durable case. Plus easy access to the camera.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I absolutely LOVE every aspect of Dexter. I wish he was a friend of mine because I would love to wipe out the scum who abuse animals
B009329Y30|5.0|Written by a writer of popular books, this movie kept my interest unlike most movies. The script and the acting was good.
B008B68IEA|4.0|I really liked this bed. I bought the frankiestein bed last year and it broke within a few days. A little upset because my daughter is very hard her toys but this bed was well built and i think will hold up nicely .
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|A bear that smokes pot and drinks and cohorts with hookers--really? I'm glad I didn't pay to see this one at the movie theatre. The puppetry was excellent and the acting was good. There were a few funny lines. I turned this movie off about thirty minutes before it ended. I will never look at teddy bears the same way again.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I wasnt sure if this was for kindle or not. I wanted to look at documents from my email on my kindle but the directions were too confusing and some didnt make sense. I was really aggravated and eventually just gave up.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I thought there would be more dancing, but no. The plot was weak and a nothing of a story. I am glad I didn't pay to see this at the movie theatre.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I rated this four stars because I liked the fact that the story didn't let me down. It was well written and the pace never let up. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00005B1W5|5.0|ABSOLUTELY, THE BEST LIVE PERFORMANCE YOU COULD EVER<br />HOPE TO OWN  .  .  .I  HAVE BOUGHT NEARLY A DOZEN COPIES
B0076DELIG|5.0|Fans of Michael Connelly won't be disappointed! I can't get enough of the character, Harry Bosch. This novel will leave &#34;fans&#34; eagerly awaiting more of the same!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I kept finding that apps that I tried to use on my kindle fire could not use their Facebook features - a huge problem for some like blip or certain games that will not allow you to play without connecting to your Facebook account. For anyone getting a repeated &quot;this app is misconfigured for Facebook&quot; error, just remove this Facebook app from your device and everything should work just fine. It's sad, really - this app worked perfectly well for me, and I am sad to see it go. But it makes many of my Facebook-integrated apps an absolutely unusable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids absolutely love this game...in fact all of their friends do too!  Very well built game with lots of things to do!  Definitely worth buying!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks delivers a great story of tales from the zombie apocalypse...after it had happened.  Even more intriguing is the effects observed through the interviews.  Highly recommended!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was curious about this book after the movie came out & was such a hit. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I'm looking forward to reading the other two books now :)
0375851569|5.0|My daughter loves these books. We've read them so much I almost know them by heart. She is learning language through rhyme which I absolutely love.
B000JVTCEK|2.0|It kept giving me a message like wrong area??? Select another area.  I finally got it to work but only on my computer where you have the option to change regions...
B000KFB4PK|5.0|My son loves it because its from Lego I was able to adjust it to my sons arm perfectly. He loves the colors and extra Lego pieces to add on he feels like he's such a big boy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Even if you find zombies hard to accept, this is a great book.  You wouldn&#34;t think the format of multiple interviews would be a great basis for an interesting story, but it works to perfection.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is seriously worth the download. Last semester was a struggle to get out of bed in time for class but now, getting out of bed is easy because i can have my favorite song wake me up and can't turn it off until i finish a few math problems...this is a great app and i recommend it! Haven't missed a class since!!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I thought Matched was the cat's meow, then I read Crossed. This book is SO much stronger than the first and a definite page turner. So well written!
098555780X|3.0|need instructions on placing clasps instead of knots maybe they could add and send to people who ordered this book
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I never saw the ending coming. Now I really can't wait for the movie! Such a great read! You won't regret it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once again Nicholas Sparks has written a beautiful love story, not only between Katie and Alex but also a love between Katie and Jo.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of the best Solitaire programs I've played. The extra options make it easy to customize it and play at your own level.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Would not let me turn. Other characters got head start. WORSE GAME EVER!!! Do not ever buy this app. That is my advice
B0018QQQK8|5.0|SO glad I read the book before watching the movie.  This is a must read if you are looking for love and willingness to fight for it.  Movie didn't even scratch the surface of the story.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book. Couldn't put it down. What a great twist of events,and an ending we all in knew would happen
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|WOW! WOW! WOW!  If you love Nicholas Sparks novels, this one will not let you down.  Fast and simple escape from life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|No that's just it! It was amazing! I mean just totally freaking AMAZING! I would recommend this book 100 percent. Please, just read it already.........you know you want to......;)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love having and hearing the Word of God though out my day. I can listen while at work and it keeps me calm and focus. Makes my day pleasant and less stressful!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Seen 5 episodes so far: Lots of intrigue; too many unnecessary sex scenes; you wonder whose up to what all throughout.  Claire Danes is doing a great job as is Mandy patinkin, Nicholas Brody is pretty convincing is the returning vet.  He kind of has you wondering if he's going in and out of some brainwashing thing. Morena Baccarin does a very good job of  playing Brody's wife and with the tensions and all.  I'm not a great TV critic but I'm still watching.  The show definitely keeps an hour of TV entertaining.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show and very easy to watch on my computer!!! I hope this rating helps others to watch this show!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I have been hooked on this thing and see the plot going down hill like all series that start great and then don't have enough material to keep the storyline up the the standard that made it great to start with. Kind of the &#34;Peter Principle&#34; idea. But so far it has not fallen very far from its great start.
0765325950|5.0|Bought this for my college age son.  He has read all the other books multiple times.  He said that this was a nice finish.
1559723505|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand why they are different from other people and why other people are different from them.  Twenty five percent of the population is highly sensitive.<br />I had this book sitting on the counter at work and a woman saw the title and told me she was highly sensitive and asked me for the author's name so she could get the book.  My mother saw the title and immediately said, &#34;I'm highly sensitive.&#34;<br />I gave the book to my brother and he said his daughter is highly sensitive.<br />The author has discovered new personality profiling with this concept.  She is educated and will educate many with the discovery of knowing there are highly sensitive people in the world and why that is so.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|For a major Bond fan like myself, I found that the 50th Anniversary Music CD to be thorough in including just about all of the title songs and also many of the instrumental passages that have become iconically &#34;James Bond&#34;.<br /><br />It's helpfuly to my collection to have all of this material on a single CD package.
B0086700CM|5.0|On the rare instances when I can wrestle this away from my 6-year-old daughter, I've found this game to be a lot of fun. Fast paced, well thought out, good graphics and sounds, and simply addictive. A real gem!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have Minecraft for Xbox and pc. At first I thought the game wasn't worth 7 dollars. But once I got it I couldn't stop playing it. I love how they set up the game and how the game doesn't crash like some apps do. If your thinking about buying this app, I recommend u do. You will love it.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|This is a dream for any fan. To have a professionally recorded live concert - complete with commentary by the band - is such a rare treat. The production and footage really captures the magic of the Mylo Xyloto tour (I had the pleasure of attending one of the Houston shows). The concert was an unbelievable experience; the best I've ever attended. Anyone who had the chance to catch the tour will love this DVD. If you missed the tour, scoop it up anyway. It will make you feel like you were there!
0345479092|3.0|I read most of the book by now, and indeed I think we need to take her advice with a grain of salt. I think babies need indeed a routine to know what is coming, but not feeding every three hours and so on. What do you do when your baby has gas and he is in pain? First of all he is not going to sleep, and then he needs to be calmed down and cuddled....and the 3 h schedule is gone.. My almost three week old son is sleeping now about 5-6 h at night in his own crib (bottle fed, he was adopted...so no breastfeeding for us), but during the day I keep myself very flexible. And yes, he has times when he just wants to be held during the day...and this is what we are doing. Or times when he wants to eat more often than I think he should. We also let him play on his own, but generally after 5 min he is done or frustrated, so we need to be around all the time. On the other hand at night we have the tendency to let him fall asleep on his own, and somehow it works without a lot of issues, since during the day we spend every minute when he is awake with him.....or sometimes he is taking naps in our arms...So what can be a crazy day, it is almost always a peaceful night...Also the \\"cues\\" were quite helpful for us.
B00009P1O2|5.0|this DVD is queen at the top of their game. Freddie mercury's voice sounds superb and the rest of the members of the band are putting their heart and souls into every note they play. even, if your not a queen fan you will be after watching this DVD. this is a must have DVD for any one's collection
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This movie was great! After the disapointment of the 2nd movie, I was a little wary about it. I got this movie for my dad for Christmas who loved it and I watched it and it was really good. It ranks right up there with the first one, it was so awesome!! The story was fun, writing was good and the acting was fabulous. LOVE LOVE LOVE.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can I say...the book everyone is reading from Ellen to George Takei....ok so they made a joke out of it....but it was the last book so had to finish the series!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game. great for when I have a few free minutes. Races are great for a quick distraction.
B005K01VZS|5.0|5 star it takes you  out  of a  narrow view of a supreme being and opens you're mind to what is good.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I gave this game 4 stars because you don't have to use real money to unlock the different games and it will take awhile to unlock all the games it provides.  Though most of the games are not that challenging, its still a lot of fun.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|you can only get so far before you have to pay I was pretty dissatisfied with that but was okay fun
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Like it. There is nothing fancy about it but it is a very good cover. Does it what it needs to do and does a great job at that
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|It does all it should and overclocks easily, especially with pre-packed overclock strategies present in my motherboard. No surprises. Not a single issue.
B00514HDNW|4.0|I choose this book due to watching the movie. This book goes much deeper into how the disease took off and how the main character goes about its discovery. The is a great psychological view on the main character and how he maintains his sanity through the end of days and absence of human contact.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life Dvd was dilvered in a timely fashion, package was well wrapped but not over wrapped. I am very pleased with my product and the professional manner it was handled.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was amazingly funny for me and the words where a good  detail for showing us what it looked like
B003MC5N28|5.0|I have always loved this book. It was my favorite book when as 10 and was so glad to find it on here! Definitely a different kind of book, no matter what age.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Goes along with the story line very well. I enjoy it a lot. Even though my parent thinks it's weird. I play it all the time.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|Entertaining read with an enthralling twist in the tale, with a quick pace and easy to read style.  I could not put the book down until finished.
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|It's was great at first, letting me download music, put songs/ videos into playlist, listen to songs, and watch music videos, then about 3 days after getting this app IT STOPS OPENING!!!  This app would of been great for if it actually continued working!!!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Courtney Milan has been my favorite author of historical romances for some time now. Not only do you get incredible romances between wonderfully written heroes and heroines but you get a depth both to characters and storyline that is amazing.<br /><br />Consider the hero in this book. He has been mistreated throughout his childhood and it has left him in deep pain. Does Milan write a broody alpha-male who takes out his hurt on the heroine - the kind of hero we know so well from other historical romances? No, she does not. The hero in this book is gentle and nice and wants to do his to make the world a better place to live in. He is very serious when it comes to love - how serious isn`t revealed until after the marriage between hero and heroine.<br /><br />The mystery surrounding Minnie, the heroine, is also very well written and when it is revealed you realize just how well the hero and heroine fit each other - how well they know each other`s pain.<br /><br />In spite of all the childhood pain these two wonderful characters have had to go through, this is not a painful book to read. It`s a book that makes you smile and a book that makes you want to read more and more and more.<br /><br />This book is a part of a series and you might want to read [[ASIN:1477589031 The Governess Affair]] before you read this book but it is, by far, not necessary. It only gives you a bit of the hero`s childhood/history. After you`ve read The Duchess War, I can recommend that you read [[ASIN:B00APONX6Y A Kiss for Midwinter (The Brothers Sinister)]] which is an incredibly good short story in the same universe.<br /><br />I am looking forward to more books in this series. I hope noone is disturbing Courtney Milan from her writing!
B00169N0BK|5.0|Color profiling monitors and printers is not for people with a low tolerance for frustration.<br /><br /> In fact, the vast majority of people who print out a few photos new and then and maybe do a little photo editing don't need to worry about color calibration. Just use the correction tools in your photo editing program.<br /><br /> For the perfectionist, though, eyeballing the color isn't enough: they want mathematical certainty - and are willing to risk their sanity to get it.<br /><br /> In particular, professionals, serious hobbyists and fine-art photographers don't really have a choice. Each print can cost them several dollars and each off-color (pun intended) print is money down the drain.<br /><br /> Enter the ColorMonki Photo. It is simpler than some devices, more complex than others. It is difficult to use - if you don't have a good understanding of what it is that you are doing in the first place. Before you purchase this kind of device, gain a solid knowledge of the importance of color profiling and the several ways in which it can be done.<br /><br /> If you're working with an LCD monitor - and who isn't? - no instrument will do much for you.<br /><br /> But even the cheapest color printer can be effectively managed with the ColorMonki. Yes, you will have to understand the t7heory of what you are trying to do and you'll have to reads the instructions, which are not intuitive. And each time you change papers or inks, you should calibrate again.<br /><br /> As I said, most people don't need to concern themselves with color management.<br /><br /> For those who do, however, ColorMonki Photo is a pretty good way to get the job done.<br /><br />Jerry
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing, I couldn't put it down. The detail is awesome, and it really describes how it actually feels to be in The Hunger Games!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Just bought this to have in my video library.  A fun movie to watch.  A definite chick flick, but still fun to watch on occasion.
B008DL466C|2.0|One of the songs is called \\"Fall Asleep\\" on O.N.I.F.C, and that is exactly what this album did to me when I heard it. Like you read in most of the other reviews, this album is recycled trash that you heard over and over before. Wiz lost his hunger to rap and now he disappoints his fans and I with O.N.I.F.C. I supported Wiz ever since I heard \\"Prince of the city\\", but now I sadly have to chalk him up with the rest of rappers who fall after they get money. Wiz ran out of lyrics and now he is just banking on dumb fans who gobble up his crap that he takes when he makes albums and mixtapes like O.N.I.F.C.
1401324649|5.0|Minutes before a birthday party held in honor of his 100th birthday, Allan Karlsson climbs out the window of his room at the nursing home. He walks over to the train station, and with no plans in his mind, he simply keeps on moving, meeting some interesting characters along the way.<br /><br />Allan has an incredibly carefree, go-with-the-flow spirit. I was fascinated to read about his many adventures, both current and past. The story was quirky, funny, with bits of history speckled throughout. Allan is a 100-year-old world traveler, after all - that's a lot of history! Allan is completely apolitical, yet somehow ends up smack in the middle of a number of major events of the 20th century. He approached his visits to foreign countries, and his conversations with world leaders, with a refreshing sort of naïvet&eacute;. His complete apathy toward political matters gives the reader a strangely fresh, open-minded perspective. I found myself laughing out loud at fictional scenes such as:<br /><br />\\"Mao Tse-tung, Kim Il Sung, and Marshal Meretskov discussed the matter [of Allan's vacation] among themselves. Cuba popped up as a possibility, and the gentlemen concluded that you could hardly imagine somewhere more capitalist.\\"<br /><br />I feel the character of Allan taps into a hope and fear that many of us have likely mulled over. Is it possible to experience a high quality of life as we live our final years? Will we be able to live according to our own whims and desires, or will we be stuck obeying a scheduled life in a nursing home? Do people in nursing homes ever think about escaping?<br /><br />\\"Allan told the man that his name was Allan, that he was exactly one hundred years old and spry for his age, so spry in fact that he was on the run from the old age home.\\"<br /><br />From that sentence on, I found myself cheering Allan as he ignored and broke the rules to follow his own desires. Good for him, going on the run like that. And what pluck, sneaking out the window only minutes before a birthday bash that included the mayor and the media! I was charmed by the great happiness Allan found through simple things such as good food and plenty of spirits: \\"Allan felt so comprehensively satisfied that he began to be almost afraid of dying.\\"<br /><br />This is an entertaining read that is quick without feeling mindless. I can see myself reading it again in the future.nutes before a birthday bash that included the mayor and the media!

B0071DJZZA|5.0|I saw the movie and had to read the book. Starts off a little slow but love it all together!
B007V65R54|5.0|A splendid book about the need for statistics to help find truths and determine directions in modern complex societies and a complex and changing environment.  Nate Silver's 538 blog in the 2012 presidential election has already demonstrated the intellectual poverty of most American political and press sources.  This book expands the discussion of information evaluation methods to topics like natural catastrophes.  Silver builds his narrative on a gradual presentation of Bayes theorem.  I read this with great enjoyment while traveling and intend to read it again later this year.
1451695195|5.0|After seeing Dr. Alexander on TV I was interested in reading the story of the Dr. Alexander brush with death and his sharing of what he experienced. He said he wrote the book because he felt he had a sense of responsibility to share with readers his personal history and how his experience has changed his out look on his own life.

B0030IG0C6|5.0|Bought as a Christmas present for a 3 year old & she just loved it! Lots of detail and very pretty!
B007DIQAXI|5.0|I ordered this album on vinyl after having heard their big hit &#34;Little Talks&#34; all over the TV and radio on a trip to Europe last summer. The album lives up to the promise of that single and then some - I would say their style is a cross between Arcade Fire and Bjork (that's probably just because they have a female singer with an Icelandic accent...) with upbeat songs and &#34;real&#34; instruments.<br /><br />-----<br />I actually had to request a replacement LP because the first copy I received did not contain an MP3 download. Amazon, of course, always step up when there is an error in a product and the replacement LP arrived today. Much to my surprise this replacement copy contained *two* MP3 download cards! What are the chances of that happening?? I was rather cynical about the whole thing and so, expecting another MP3-free copy, I (rather self-consciously) videoed myself opening the package so I would have 'proof' that I wasn't just giving away MP3 copies or something.
B009LHOBT4|5.0|Very good book, describes various techniques in an easy, understandable language. I bought the e-book version, and this format suits the book well.<br />Recommended!
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|A movie without words, but which tells a thousand stories from around the world - some of them joyous, some disturbing, and all of them a deep reflection of our humanness. A wonderful experience.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a terrifically produced, acted and filmed action/suspense story about current terrorism and how it poses a threat to this nation.  We can't wait until the next season becomes available!  We watch this on Amazon streaming video.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I was really anticipating the release of this movie and I was not disappointed.  It's not earth-shattering, but well worth the time and money invested.
0810945797|3.0|For some reason I thought this would be more of a making-of style book.  It's not.  There are too many stills from the movie, and while it includes some concept and production art, there isn't as much as I'd hoped for, and no context as to how or why various designs were chosen, nor any of the technical aspects behind animating them.  There are a LOT of drawings of circles, though, some of which include transparent overlays of yet more circles.<br /><br />As to the text, it's a lot of high-falutin' nonsense such as this: \\"The apparent roughness and unraveling of the cord is due to the urRu technique of twining uncut threats, which can be separated only by chewing, partly amalgamating the ends.\\"  Huh?<br /><br />This book is a must-have if you live and breath the Dark Crystal, have a circle-fetish, or are remotely interested in the string-tying techniques of animatronic puppets.  It's a pass if you want a technical retrospective on how the film was made.  It is very nicely produced (though some reviews indicate not as nicely as the original version), and the pitchbook in the back that Henson/Froud used to solicit financing is interesting.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Got this to read before seeing new movie in December 2012.  I had already seen broadway production, but some of the events didn't make sense until I ready the book.
0061478784|5.0|This book was purchased because it was chosen for 10th grade school reading assignment. The reader loves it and could not put it down.<br />Ordering and delivery was easy and prompt!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|While I thought this was a good book, it became way too mushy and intense for my liking.  The story line however was great, I could have just done without all the mushy parts that were too long and the sex scenes that were very intense and too detailed.  With that being said, the story behind all of that was a great story!
B000FC1MCS|2.0|The beginning of this book had a &#34;grab you&#34; moment, and that was the end of the interest.  I had chosen this book for my book club without having read it beforehand and concensus among my fellow readers ... worst book read by our club.  We all agreed that to live a life with aspergers, autism, etc. is extremely difficult for everyone involved.  The book did give you a good incite into what goes on in the mind of someone afflicted, but there wasn't any cohesive plot to follow to make it interesting.  We all felt that due to the lack of a good story, it made this book very monotonous.  Sorry.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Psychology buffs or students will like this better than I did.  I read it as two co-dependents--both with mental problems.  This is the second book by Gillian Flynn that I have read that dealt very sadly with mental illness and I won't go there again.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was a really good book. This review is from my 4th grade son who is  in the 4th grade. Thank you Rick riorden for making my son a reader! (and to mrs.  Breaux, his 4th grade teacher)
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Liked it a lot - Got too wordy in some places and it dragged on because of it.  But the plot was good with lots of twists that did keep your attention - once you got past the overly wordy parts.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This is a very nice and enjoyable point and click game. Graphics are nice, storyline is interesting. All around good game. Good puzzles.  Very good game for the price.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|I absolutely loved this improbable funny movie. I'm not normally a Bruce Willis fan But I certainly am a fan of all the others and liked him in this as well. If you like action movies and fun ones as well you will like this one.

B005GSY23M|2.0|Only has like 2 good songs on it. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this just for two songs unless you know the songs I'm talking about and you really love them or, you like the background music that is 90% of the cd.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I recently purchased a new laptop and decided it was time for a wireless mouse. I bought the Magic Mouse and thought the Mobee Charger made sense so I bought it as well.  The mouse has been on the charger for 3 days and the green light is still blinking. I have tried to remove the battery pack so I could try alkaline batteries and like other posters, I am having heck trying to remove the battery pack. I am on the verge of throwing the whole thing across the room but I don't want to damage my new mouse. I recommend you do not purchase the Mobee Magic Mouse Charger until they improve the fit of the battery pack.<br /><br />I did not purchase these items through Amazon. I am returning the Mobee Charger to Apple for a refund. I don't want another one. I am considering also returning the Magic Mouse. I can use the trackpad.

B0058YPGL6|5.0|Also purchased for my daughters 11th birthday and the way her eyes lit up was so very worth it, and we all watch it together
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down - all the twists and turns kept me guessing til the end.<br />Immediately bought her other books.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very interesting book. Well written by a professional soldier. Does not glorify war or killing but tells the story of getting bin Laden in a simple straightforward way.  I would recommend this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great love story! The book had a small twist at the ending that I was not expecting, but I loved!
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Not a bad read but I would definitely label it for young adult. The story had lots of potential but fell short in developing the plot.  Just did not have enough depth.  However I did  finish it.  Where was that teacher when I was in high school?
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|I really like Tim Burton movies and even though Frankenweenie may not be as exciting as Corpse Bride or Nightmare before Christmas it is still a wonderful story
0765325950|4.0|Like most readers of the Wheel of Time, I have been waiting almost 20 years for this moment.  And I find it sadly a little lacking.  Now, I discovered Brandon Sanderson because he was chosen to write this(these) book(s) and I have to say, I love his work.  That being said, he faced an almost impossible task of taking on a series beloved by millions of people and left nowhere even close to a conclusion.  That being said, I think he really did the best with what he had.<br /><br />I have always felt that a great series, even if only a trilogy, will devote several chapters at the end, after the final battle is won, to tie up loose ends and give some good solid closure to the characters that readers have invested emotionally in.  Tolkien did it and set a good precedent.  Several other prominent authors have done the same, David Eddings, David Feist, Weis and Hickman to name a few.  Each of these authors devoted several dozen pages to wrapping up their stories and answering those last questions that couldn't be worked in otherwise.  Several other notable authors do not do this.  I have MANY problems with the Harry Potter series as I consider it horrible prose from start to finish, but a huge boil on it's face is that fact that Rowling tried to wrap up a seven book series in an Epilogue of only a few pages.  To my vast disappointment, I must now lump Robert Jordan in with the latter group.  My disappointment when I realized that the ending he had visualized from the beginning, for a series that now spans 14 books at just over 4 million words, is only about 10 pages long was very high indeed.<br /><br />I intend this to be spoiler free so I will not go into detail, but I was also sad to see so many questions still left unanswered and I find myself again in the position of waiting on the next Wheel of Time book for my answers, this time an Encyclopedia of Robert Jordan's world.  Other questions were answered as to steal all of the magic out of the question that so many hadpondered for over 15 years or more.  Questions like how did Matt die and live again?  Where was Demandred all this time?  What exactly was Shaidar Haran?  All are answered, all be it one of them still a little vaguely, with such an offhandedness that it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Now, that being said, this WAS a good book and an enjoyable read.  Did we really need 700, possibly more, of this 900 page volume to focus on the war?  Probably not.  I would even go so far as to say, no we did not.  Brandon Sanderson did a great job of writing it and the prose is well written.  I truly feel he was handicapped by Robert Jordan's ending that he wanted to keep in tact for obvious reasons and so could not give us all the answers we were looking for.  But I have to say I enjoyed reading chapter 37 at a whopping 198 pages very much.  It all was very well written and did in fact cause me sadness at certain moments.  Brandon Sanderson delivered well in his writing as he always does.<br /><br />The final note will be for the quality of the book itself, physically.  This book was printed on very cheap paper and as such a number of flaws and flecks are found throughout, to the tune of just about one a page which had me wiping my hands on the pages trying to remove what I thought was hair only to find it was in the paper itself.  Maybe it was just my copy, but I suspect not.  I suspect it was Tor using cheaper paper due to cost of printing in this time of recession and more expensive commodities.  A chunk of about 5 pages were creased before I even cracked open the book, a dent was put in the book by my thumb holding my place for 30 seconds while speaking to my daughter and the pages themselves felt, thin for lack of a better word.  It was definitely not the quality of printing I have come to expect from TOR.<br /><br />The real reason I took off one star was because of the physical quality of the book, not the content as I really did enjoy reading it.  I justwish the ending had been more of what I was expecting and that is possibly my own fault as I had my own expectations going into it.  I now only hope that the promised Encyclopedia will have the answers to the questions I am still left with and so, once again, I wait on a Wheel of Time book, hopefully for the last time.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|this is the best movie ever, love it so much I plan to buy several more.  price was a little high

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was funny good an it had a lot of description!! I loved when Jeff made a lot of jokes
B003B02O0A|5.0|Fast paced great read! Will probably read it again and again. Follows the movie nicely but of course the movie always leaves a few people out. As always the book is better than the movie
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I play it all the time, Its addicting!  ads dont get in the way of game play, rather unnoticeable when using the game
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The Sound of Music is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I've seen it on TV, on VHS, and DVD.  The Blu-ray edition with restored picture and sound is absolutely gorgeous... the way this film was meant to be.  Finally, I format that does this classic the justice it deserves.  I got the limited edition combo for Christmas, and I love all the special extras.  Even if you own this movie in DVD, you are missing out if you pass up the Blu-ray. I highly recommend it!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I live in an area that has a lot of wind.  It howls around the corners of the house and wakes me up sometimes or just keeps me awake at night.  by using this application in my room, the wind didnt bother me and I got one of the best nights sleep Ive had in a long time!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|i use this for daily devotional, bible study, church, looking up stuff during conversations with friends. it is awesome.<br />so easy to use, so many different versions of the bible to pick from, you can highlight favorite passages, bookmark stuff. it's just wonderful.
B008M4OYYY|5.0|Warning: nanoblocks may be addictive  - I look forward to new models everyday!  You WILL need tweezers and a way to keep cats and small children from assisting in assembly.
B0058VW36U|5.0|not normally my type of game ,<br />but my mom recommended it so i thought i would<br />try it. i loved it. the little guy is so cute and it really<br />makes you think trying to figure out in what sequence<br />to do everything. very challenging too
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am hooked on this game, you will be too, if you download it!  So much fun!!  It is right up there with Temple Run.  Graphics are good and is a good time waster, just when I think I am going to go the distance I mess up and have to try again. But that is ok, good excuse to keep on playing!  It isn't hard to play, enjoyable!  If you want to be entertained and have some fun get this app, it is free, what more could you ask for??  Quit delaying, and download it, you won't be sorry.  I thought it was just for kids, but I was wrong!!  I am a Grandma and I have fun playing it!! When I downloaded mine it didn't have the picture, so now I am stuck with an \\"a\\" instead.  Wish I knew how to fix that, if that is possible?  Don't want to remove it and redownload it because I will lose all my coins!!  May have to call Amazon support to find out what I can do.  Update:  Just turned on my Kindle and the icon is now the way it should be, I don't have the \\"a\\" in a box anymore!  Yippee!  Love this game!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|who needs an ereader or a tablet when you have this?<br />i can get every book i want and i can read it in a book the<br />size of my hand. no tablet to lug around. highly recommend.
0684859106|5.0|Has so many easy to make recipes for cakes. I didn't want to miss out on any of the recipes soI bought Recipes from the World-Famous Bakery and Allysa Torey's Home Kitchen  as well. Only disappointment is that book has all the recipes from this book and many more. I wish it was stated in the introduction. But I don't regret getting this. This is user friendly with hard cover and wish it has pictures!
B006O6F932|5.0|I liked a lot this product, Thanks for all and for a faster shippment. I really will by with you other product.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this show.  I really like the actors and their takes on Holmes and Watson.  I'm looking forward to more episodes.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love to play this game.  cant stop- it is very additive.  cant wait to get more coins and play more.
0525952616|5.0|Suarez has an incredibly knack for taking all the bits and pieces that are out there, combining them, and pushing them just one more step. It makes for a gripping and very believable story.
B002TYZKIM|3.0|I was always a big Michael Jackson fan, but I really wasn't crazy about this movie.  It was okay, but didn't live up to all the hype for me.
B0067EKY9K|5.0|Knowing nothing about this movie, we were thrilled to discover such an enchanting film.  We highly recommend giving this a shot (or a cast?), it's a great watch.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The Cd arrived pretty quick and I was very pleased. The item arrived as it was described. Very pleased with the entire order.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Fun and addicting game; my child loves it! The pets are adorable and the games are easy though somewhat varied.
B000002NJS|4.0|I don't remember purchasing this CD so it must have been a gift. LOL Really can't say anything else about it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Proof of Heaven was a little too technical re medical  information but overall was insightful into life after death experience.
0671799320|3.0|Bought this for my husband. I don't believe he has read it yet. It's just sitting on a book shelf.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Besides the tough subject matter of spousal abuse, I loved this book, loved these characters with the added twist at the end!
B008IGP8QE|5.0|Got this for my daughter who is 9 yrs old. she loves the show and seems to really enjoy the CD
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i was hooked on this book almost from the first page.  Suzanne Collins knows how to weave a tale and keep enough information back to keep you reading to find out what will happen!!  I can't wait to see the movie altough it won't have as much information as this book.  I gave this book 5 stars because I JUST COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!!
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I loved Ken Follett's other books (Pillars of the Earth, World Without End, Eye of the Needle), but this one had me skimming past all the war strategy.  I found it difficult to finish, but for those that love a good war novel, this is still a well written book.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Really makes you think, great for keeping your brain active and it gives you hints if it gets to hard. Nice music too.
0425252868|5.0|An absolutey INCREDIBLE BOOK about an incredible story. But that's not all, Franz Stigler and the men he served with will astound you! Any pre-misguided views about the German warriors will be corrected. This is a life changing book, not to sound dramatic, but again -- it's time for us to really see the way it was for so many honorable men in the fights of their lives. I wholeheartedly agree that this book should be in the schools. This is a very easy read book, the author is masterful for drawing you in, and it gives you that depressed feeling when it's finished.(Also, a good read to supplement this book is The Star of Africa by Colin Heaton.) Even though there's some technical facts, this book doesn't make you feel inadequate in any way regardless of age, gender, or military knowledge. DON'T HESITATE ANOTHER MINUTE WITH THIS ONE, IT'S THAT GOOD!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved it. I could never put it down the end of the book leaves me hanging and I need to read the next book
B002D0L0R2|5.0|It'snice to watch a movie where the plot, although good, isn't so convoluted that you need notes to keep up.  This is a feel-good movie with a good message and some FANTASTIC music.  I bought it because our Summerstock is going to do it this coming summer and I had never watched it before.  Although the plot is slightly different in the movie than in the Broadway stage version, it doesn't detract from the story (Tracy has some jailhouse sequences in the stage version that aren't in the movie).  Definitely worth the money.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a  GREAT  book I really hope they make a next one I highly recommend this to all Jeff Kinney fans this book is very easy to read its 118 pages but I like books like the hunger games that take long but still thanks Jeff Kinney(:
B008J1QFLU|5.0|I have known about and listened to the original LP version since it was released in the 1960s. This remastered version features more clearly defined voices and instruments. How thrilling it is to hear the incomparably magniicent voice of Birgit  Nilssen recorded in such realism for posterity! But the best feature may be one that could not be reproduced on LPs: The huge dynamic range of the original  performance. One of the friends who listened to it with me on my high-end audio system said,  &#34;I's just like being at Bayreuth!  I have tears in my eyes.&#34;<br /><br />The supplemental material will keep me busy for months.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Like stated above in the title, . I have absolutely no words to describe this book with. It was by far one of the best reads I have ever read. I strongly suggest this to anyone who can pick up a book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would love to follow this family until the end of time. The story, the cast, the characters thrill me! What a wonderful performance. I love each and everyone of them.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It's ok but people r rude on there when they talk, that should be banned. It will not load. Other than that it's an OK game :(
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Simiply absorbing! I love love love this show! Hope this show never ends!! Season 3 is great! I can't wait till Feburary gets here!!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|it fills time even though it is not challenging as a game.  glad to have on a portable device  i will look at other games
B008K7PS1Q|5.0|This is a beautiful and interesting CD. I am surprised we have not heard more about it in the US.  Her voice is pure, unique, strangely calming and harmonizes perfectly with the words and music.  I love all the songs.  My only critical comment is the song \\"Places\\" sounds a little too much like Patti Smith's \\"Horses\\".  Interesting they named the CD after this song.  My favorite is the first song, \\"ICU\\".  A song about longing for a relationship past...\\"All that is left now are my dreams and memories but I'm glad you came through my life and put your stain on me\\".  We've all be there.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Was great to access through instant video so that i could watch the episodes when ever and where ever i pleased.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Suspense all the way thru. A beautiful love story. He sounded a bit too good to be true, but it was a good read.
B00APUQH0W|1.0|Whoever at Amazon loaded this into their system mistakenly set it to a 16:9 format.  This movie was shot in 70mm or 2.76:1 format. So everyone on the screen got the &#34;skinny&#34; effect.  Frustrated, my wife and I stopped watching the Amazon rental and  paid more money at Vudu.com just to watch without getting a headache.<br /><br />Otherwise, this movie was terrific.  We will change our 1 star rating if Amazon gives us a refund. I seem to have a difficult time finding anything related to getting refund.  Not happy about that. If this happens again we would consider not using this service until we were assured of satisfaction guaranteed.<br /><br />FYI: other than this movie, we are very happy with Amazon's service and competitive pricing and quality product.
B002BWP49C|5.0|With each movie n this series I have held my breath until it was released--was excited to get this part one and can't wait until part 2 is on DVD.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have not read much from Stephen King for a number of years, but I read this book twice. It is a very long book, but is never tedious. I missed a lot the first time, so went back and read it a second time.  Beleivable story. Loved being taken back in some ways to the 50's and 60.s. Life was a lot simpler then. There are a lot of books out about the Kennedy assaination. I will love to see how they stack up to this  work of fiction.
0375842381|5.0|Loved the Golden Compass movie and extremely disappointed that sequels weren't made. Loved it so much contacted movie company to see why sequels were not made. Apparently, a religious/church beliefs outweighed what fans wanted. Amazing since so many movies out there that are extreme in so many ways but these could not be made because the cat****c church thought it heresy. Sorry, venting. But I was glad to find the books so that I could read the final story.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app gives accurate weather and was easy to install.  My only problem is that it loads only one way and will not flip no matter which way I turn my kindle.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I can't stop playing this game! If you like quick games with achievement challenges, you will like this game. Even after I played through all the challenges,  I kept playing!
B002N44XSG|5.0|Awesome book should be longer is there any more books like this for Percy Jackson<br /><br />The interviews were awesome read them
B003LSTK8G|5.0|If you loved Liar's Poker, you'll love this book. The narrative is captivating, yet still incredibly informative and educational regarding the subprime bond market up to 2008.
B000002IO1|5.0|She has a sexy voice and a \\"get down\\" feeling - I'm a dancer so I like her sound.  There's one song in particular that I love, so I bought the CD. I was not disappointed.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Clancy does it again with the marriage of high tech and wild action. It's always fun to be absorbed into good vs evil battles of these fictional plots that sound all too real.
B00000IZOR|4.0|This product was a little smaller than I expected, but our 14-month old son still loves it!  He mostly drags it around the house and watches its eyes move and the wheels spin.  He puts the receiver up to his ear, but the cord is only about 6&#34; long so he picks up the whole phone with it. Still a good buy though.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|By letting his readers see the evolution of the 20th Century through the eyes of believable characters, Ken Follett has answered many of the hows and whys we have arrived at where we are today. Looking forward to Book Three!
B0037UUZQY|5.0|I took my daughter to Disney on Ice 2012 and bought her the Rapunzel doll they were selling at the event.  Total garbage for $26.  This doll is WAY higher quality because her hair doesn't fall out (the other doll's did) and she's not flimsy.  She was also less expensive.  My 5 year old happily threw away the old doll for this new one. She loves it!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love the way Ken Follett brings history to life through his characters. His understanding of how things happened brings meaning to what happened in our supposedly civilized world at the beginning of the last Century.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Its bacically twitter! It does what I Want it to do! Nothing too special, but overall it works fine...although sometimes its a little slow with updating...but I think there will be a fix for it! I mean its a free app...like I said nothing to special but it works the way it should.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You Will Not Be Disappointed! Flow Is A Fun Game Where You Try To Cover The Board.Have Fun With The Game.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|I bought this on the strength of &#34;Somebody I Used to Know&#34; and &#34;Eyes Wide Open.&#34; It's not bad, but it's nowhere near as energetic as I'd expected. By and large, it's quiet, menacing, and repetitive to the point where it can be difficult to tell when the songs change unless you're listening carefully. It's not bad, but there just isn't a lot of meat to this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely cannot believe this book. Just cannot. I almost stopped reading after the first few chapters because it wasn't living up to expectations, but I am so glad I kept reading, because this was completely crazy. Must read.
0307278255|4.0|Unaccustomed Earth by Jhumpara Lahiri is a compilation of eight short stories, five that are independent and three that are interdependent. Although the characters and culture is Bengali based, the themes are universal. Lahiri touches on themes that cross cultural divides.Coping with an aging parent's widowhood and new relationships,experiencing the loneliness of a passionless marriage,recharging the battery of  a stale marriage,dealing with  pain and guilt when alchoholism invades a family,and coping with the enormous loss that comes with  a parent's death are some of the very human themes that Lahiri touches upon with great insight.She is a very intuitive writer who can evoke a deep connected feeling from the reader. She does try to add a surprise twist to her story endings which adds another positive dimension to her writing. I did feel that the last three stories ran on a bit too long to get to the heart of the relationships but I enjoyed the stories as a whole.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  As a witty, hopeless romantic this book definitely fit my personality.  I couldn't put it down.  This was the first time I ever read a book by this author and I am pleasantly surprised.  I definitely look forward to reading more from her.
B007L6VR12|5.0|When I first about the movie I wasn't really interested until I finally bought it. Watched the whole thing and couldn't stop laughing. It is an amazing movie. Anderson, Copolla and his cast do a great job at delivering a masterpiece.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This newest installment of the Harry Bosch series is one of the best. Its title, The Black Box, refers to the one clue that is the key to unlocking a murder mystery -- the beginning of the trail that leads a detective to \\"who done it.\\" Like the black box in an airplane, the clue leads investigators on to others until, finally, the cause of a murder is revealed.<br /><br />In this instance, the victim is a member of the foreign press, who seems to have come to Los Angeles in 1992 to cover the race riots that followed the acquittal of the cops who beat Rodney King. Harry responded to the murder when it was reported back then, and now he is called upon to revisit that investigation as a cold case. Naturally, author Michael Connelly supplies readers with plenty of twists and turns in the plot and it is a good story.<br /><br />One of the things that I like about this particular Bosch novel is the increased appearance of his daughter, Maddie. She has shown up in earlier books, but in the last few Connelly has given Maddie more of a role. Now she's a teenager who has decided on police work as a career. Harry has mixed feelings about this, but wants to prepare Maddie in case she follows through with her plans. So he is teaching her to shoot, to observe closely and to use her considerable brain power to deduce past events from the clues that she discovers. Connelly has given Maddie and Harry an interesting relationship that is both typical, and not so typical, of a modern American father and daughter and it is pleasant to read about their interactions.<br /><br />Maddie, plus Harry's current lady friend Hannah, add dimension to the story and inject some interesting female characters into a genre that usually includes females only when they are on a slab in the morgue.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book taught me many things; interesting things about animals, about life, love and loss, and strength to survive.  Excellent!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book showed in my Amazon recommendations yesterday morning. Due to time constraints I couldn't finish it yesterday, something that I wanted very much to do. It's one of those books you just cannot put down. It is some very serious science fiction, placed in a near future and based on tecnology that if not readily available might just be around the corver.<br /><br />It's a Robinson Crusoe kind of plot that centers around an astronaut left for dead on the surface of Mars. An enthralling tale of ingenuity and resourcefulness that ultimately come to a truly exploding grand finale.<br /><br />At the going price (free, save for the US$0.99 that Amazon charges for its distribution) it is a true steal!<br /><br />I've purchased a handful of other startup authors at very low prices and more than half of it have proved to be a waste of some change and time. Many of them can't write worth a dime. Believe me, this is not the case. After reading half the sample -an ample one, by the way- I spent my dollar to Amazon and downloaded it to my devices. I'm giving it to friends but not as a freebie as the author generously allows. Although the dollar won't go to his pockets but to Amazon, I hope the popularity does him some good. I would gladly pay a regular price for it. It's simply excellent; five stars plus a cherry on top!
B0031GUR44|1.0|As stated in the title... It does not fit a 2010 VW GTI as it was advertised.  I suspect that this is the same for 2008.5 - 2012
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I came across this in Season two, I was mesmerized and would stay up watching this series. I think it is one of the most interesting programs I have watched in many years. You never know what is going to happen, we laugh, we cry, it doesn't get any better then that.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|I ordered this box with high hopes. The Beatles music is great, but the quality of the vinyls was not ok. I ordered the box twice. First time there was something wrong with the Abbey Road record, it made a rasping noise. I returned the box, but next time there was the same problem with the Sergeant Pepper record. That's why I can't recommend this box.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway sufers is the best game ever can never stop playing it all the new stuff is amazing every one in the world while its here get it
B00005AWMF|5.0|Great album to listen to on long drives.  Most songs are way above average.  I do not regret purchasing this.
0316019984|5.0|If you're looking for the most serious, detailed pop-up book, this is the book for you.  WOW!!!  It truly is the ultimate pop-up book.  Not only are the pop-ups impressive, the information on each superhero and some villians is very detailed.  You will learn things about each character that you never knew.  If you're looking for a thin book, however, this is not the book for you.  It's at least 4 inches thick.  Still, the coolest pop-up book I've ever seen.
B008602KQI|3.0|I think if I hadn't read the books first I never would have after watching this disjointed and none too interesting rendition of what really is a good and one of a kind story.  It wasn't just the missing details that movies made from books usually run into, it is just plain not good.  Sorry guys, try harder next time.  The Hunger Games and Katniss deserves it.
B0002KPIQY|4.0|WELL, I DIDN 'T LIKE THE MOVIE, BUT I ORDERED IT, AND IT GOT HERE REALLY FAST. AND WAS AS DESCRIBED IN THE PACKAGE. BUT WISH I HAD NOT ORDERED IT. THE MOVIE WAS A DUD. NOT A BAD WORD ABOUT SUPPLIER OR SHIPPER THOUGH.
B007I2BZIE|1.0|I shouldn't have to preface this that I am a rush fan but I am. I have been to every tour since Moving pictures and this album (sorry cd) I a mess. Each song is the same as the last. Nothing memorable. Nothing sticks. I saw this tour three times and still was bored it of my mind. Neil needs to get out of his \\"this is what I feel and hope everyone gets it\\" phase. Write about something meaningful. And please Alex quit with the ear piercing horn sounding guitar parts.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Wide variety of music.  There is something for everyone.  Clear sound.  Consistant play.  I am very pleased.  :-) I highly recommend XiiaLive Pro.
1455502758|4.0|This had a lot more agonizing over the pain of cancer and the treatments than I expected. It was a change of pace but still a very good read. Don't buy this expecting it to be a story of a man dying and boldly facing it without a god. Yes, that is what he did but he doesn't address that fact all that much in this short read. I thought there would be a bit more play with entertaining the thought of giving in to a god in the face of death and explaining why he wasn't doing such a thing. He barely touched on this. Like my title says....good, but not what I expected or hoped for.
B004HO6HWK|5.0|The movie is very good. it has a lot of action in it. Though it is a little greusome to watch
B008OOYALE|3.0|It is slow to build.  I read the other reviews regarding this and though that I tend to be more patient about this sort of thing than most people.  On this one I have to agree.  I check in a few times a day but otherwise there is not a lot that I can do to speed things along without paying through the nose.  The area you need to bulid in is covered with trees.  It cost 1500 cash to clear a tree.  It has taken me a week just to clear the intitial field much less expand.  Buying dragan habitats is expensive, feeding dragons is expensive, expanding land for habitats is expensive, clearing land is expensive...  The dragons are cute and the social thing if fun but I don't how long I will play this one.
B004EPYZOY|5.0|It is very good. It is very greusome and the story line was interesting. a lot of stuff in the movie
B000002ITW|3.0|Wow!  Haven't heard this in over 30 years.  Loved the original when I was in high school.  Just picked up the expanded version on CD.  The acoustic stuff still sounds great, but there is a huge problem--this is NOT CSN, nor CSNY--it is solo stuff ala Beatles White album.  Crosby and Nash do some beautiful stuff together first set, Stills shines on his own, esp Black Queen, which if you play blues guitar like me, is worth the price of admission alone.  Really, really cool stuff.  He rocks that acoustic guitar like Robert Johnson on steroids!!<br /><br />The best is N. Young--he steals the show and sounds by far the most polished and impassioned, solo-(both gorgeous vocals and great guitar pickin), but he too is on his own.<br /><br />Not sure why Judy Blue Eyes and Find the cost of Freedom are the only ones with the entire band, although truncated versions.  My guess is the band was really wasted and had no examples of good three part harmonies that would work for a real live album.  Why else?<br /><br />Other than that, it is good stuff, and fun to hear again.  Plus, the crowd is absolutely electric!  They have found their American Beatles!!  Some of the crowd feedback is spine-tingling, esp after David's stuff and Stephen's 49 bye bye's tune.<br /><br />Buy this USED for half price.  There is literally no new information on the band from liner notes which is absurd, considering this is historic stuff!  The acoustic set is really hauntingly beautiful even though it is not CSN together, but the electric is mostly garbage.  I am a musician.  That amateur jamming was fine back in the 10th grade.  But buy it for the acoustic material alone.  You won't be disappointed.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Great movie to go with a great book - recommended for kids 5 and up.  Very true to the book.

B004Y042N8|3.0|This is ok but its a free app of the day there are no adds but I dont really like it not worth buying just get the regular one WITH Adds
0321885112|5.0|If you're the least bit intrigued by the idea of sketching your notes, let this book be your guide. It provides a rationale for sketchnoting, shows a variety of examples from other sketchnoters, and walks you step by step through the entire process. Along the way the book discusses tools, explains techniques, and offers tips. I'm using the things I've learned to improve the notes I take during business meetings and sermons.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|This recording reminds me in some places of the psychedelic rock of the Beatles, sometimes Pink Floyd or others... but it's always wonderful. I've been playing this every day since I got it (and considering how many CDs I have, that's quite saying something!). Highly recommended!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game. It is a regular Solitaire game.  The ads pop up at the beginning and they run a video.  I have State Farm Ins.  I DO NOT need to see the ad over and over.  I'm rather pay $.99 and have No Ad!!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Great movie that is why I bought. Took a just about a week to receive but love this movie boy.

0425263908|5.0|This is a great book to read, once you start, you don't want to put it down.  I recommend it highly.
1423136802|5.0|my daughter loves these books and wanted the set even though she had already read them.  she read all five books in one week!
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I do not watch American Idol so I had no idea of the talent of this new performer.  I did hear the single and enjoyed it so I decided to buy the entire CD.  Upon first listen, I really enjoyed the entire disk.  Now after several listening sessions, I love the album.  He almost sounds like a one person Mumford and Sons.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I suppose when you are an attorney, this book fails. There is no real story here. The horrible crime is preempted by the \\"Nature vs. Nurture\\" argument. Many people feel this way about young people accused of crimes. Having appreciated the benefits of a good education I know there is so much more to the tragedies caused by pathological conduct. The theme reminds me of the Jorn van der Sloot case. That simplicity is the sum total of the message. The writing itself may be spectacular and the Shiva portrayal in this book was a welcomed change. However, being a parent, an attorney who occasionally represents young people, and a former educator, I cannot recommend this book. It is much too cynical for my taste. Furthermore, the criminal justice system is poorly represented here and it is critical that Americans are provided accurate information.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Great as all the other books from Daniel Pink. Lots of social science studies and great tips. The new reality of sales (or moving others) is here, don't miss it.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This is the first review I have ever done anywhere. I take the time to do so, because I feel that Gaems has put together a great product and deserves all the support I could provide. Great job!<br /><br />Like many others before me have indicated, the G155 is an outstanding gaming accessory.  I purchased the G155 late July 2012 in preparation for a deployment.  Following are sone of my experiences:<br /><br />- I hand-carried the unit throughout my entire trip between my home to my deployed location with zero issues.<br />- I originally thought that it would be less useful outside of traveling; however, the gaming experience has been outstanding so I recently decided that I will continue to use it for gaming even while at home.  I would be remiss if I did not point out that I make this decision even though I own an excellent home theater with excellent surround sound. The engineering of this device is that good.<br />- finally, my G155 is so popular out here that I know of at least six other soldiers that have either purchased this unit or the newer UNSC Vanguard model.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to test out the Vanguard unit, and I am blown away yet again. So much so that I have just ordered one.  I decided to hold a free lottery that will include all the junior soldiers in my unit.  The lucky winner will receive my G155 soon after my Vanguard arrives.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend the G155 or the Vanguard to all deploying gamers and to all other gamers that want the flexibility that these units provide.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|The movie came intact and shipped on time. It was priced right and my husband added to his Bourne collection. Good movie.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Streisand really hit a home run with this DVD! The clothing, the background, the language......it is all so true to form! I have been looking for this DVD for years....glad I finally found it!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Chris Nolan's Batman movies are awesome. Bought this for my sons stockings. They shipped on time and were priced reasonably. They were pleased to receive their favorite movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Why did it have to end? Kindle kept recommending this book for me, and I just ignore it. I can honestly say I'm so overjoyed that I finally gave way to it. Hopeless Is an amazing story. Holder and Sky's story is so real and true.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story has the distinction of having been read in quick secession right after having plowed through The Stand, Swan Song, and all four Ender's Game books while I did data entry at my office.<br /><br />I love all those books. I love all of those stories for different reasons. I however did not enjoy them even an inch as much as I enjoyed Wool 1-5, and that's saying something.<br /><br />I very much look forward to reading the next ones, and hope to hear more stories about the silos :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good app with numerous different games. Would recommend to anyone who likes short games, something for everyone. Wish more were unlocked however
B003Y5H59C|5.0|Hot, hot, hot. If she liked shades of grey then get this and watch it with...This movie follows a troubled girl as she attempts to find a compatible mate... through her employer who expresses his interest in a very physical manner. Some S&M.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|My wife and others in the family really enjoy this show. I purchased both season 1 and 2 and as soon as she finished them they were quickly passed around the family. Thanks.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|The first time I played this game I was addicted.  I have shared it with my brother and he keeps playing it every chance he gets.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Waste of money! This book is very bad. The main girl in unlikeable as is her boyfriend. It shows an unhealthy relationship as a healthy one...and honestly the mob plot was dumb. IDK. I could enjoy dumb plots but the relationship! was to much. Reading these reviews of how good it makes me sad. I'd give examples, but I'm reviewing from my phone.
B002RV01QI|2.0|The case was cracked when it arrived and one of the hinges was missing.  I was enjoying the music very much, until it skipped twice.  Very disappointed.
0765325950|1.0|I agree with others on here.  His widow just made a huge mistake.  I like many others have been using ereaders for years now and I have no intention of purchasing the hard or soft cover of this book.  Sadly because of Harriet's poor decision her husbands legacy will have one less consumer - one less number to count on.  True I'm but one person but add up the others that feel the same as I do and one person becomes a lot larger.  I'll just wait to read this book for FREE.. yes free.  I may wait a little longer then others who are already reading this book but at least I can stand up and say, \\"You are wrong for doing this and I won't be apart of your plan Harriet to use your husbands fans forcing them into purchasing a physical book to increase numbers/sales.\\"
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|This was a great book. Easy read. I had to read it for school in a week and easily finished it. However, it was extremely sad.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I'm fairly certain my title says all I really can say about this amazing book. I couldn't put it down!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Such a great book! Great studies used within the book. I'm going to try to lose the wheat. I highly recommend reading this book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was the first book I have read on my new Kindle Fire HD.  It was a very enjoyable quickly read sci_fi story .  It brought to mind The Lottery , Lord Of The Flies, as well as sci_fi stories concerning governmental oppression, survival in harsh and dangerous environments and forced gladiatorial combat.<br />  I enjoyed this novel enough that I have already purchase the other two books of this trilogy.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was like living a dream. I will recommend it to anyone that will listen! It was so magical, the characters so vivid, the circus amazing. My only complaint is that the circus isn't real. As far as I know....
B0041KVW2K|5.0|My set arrived in perfect condition. A couple records had minor warping but nothing that caused issues with playback. All records were cleaned on my VPI record cleaner before being played on my VPI Scout. Quality of the pressings in my opinion is average for what is coming out today. As long as you're not expecting Mobile Fidelity quality, I think you will be happy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual, a great book from John Grisham. Fast paced, and a surprise ending that I truly did not expect.<br /><br />Clever story, very enjoyable reading.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|the grandkids of course love it as all the movies like these they can't wait till the next one they watch it over and over
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Pretty understandable except for a few questionable points. The book recommends MS Word 2010, but many of the instructions seen to relate to Word 2003. An example is the discussion about page breaks which shows an illustration of the Word 2010 screen but describes the Word 2003 approach.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read it straight through in just one night. I just couldn't put it down.
0679809015|5.0|Thought is was a little bigger but it is a tiny cardboard book but my boys love the flip panels
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Amazing! If you like magic filled with twists and wonderful adventurs then this series is for you and i would reccomend this series o anybody!
0765325950|4.0|Brandon Sanderson did an amazing job wrapping up a series which had well over 2,000 named characters. I can't believe I read the book so quickly!<br /><br />My only quibble with the ending is that entirely too much time is spent on the Androl Arc. I spent 20 years getting to know the Two Rivers characters--they're like old friends. I'd have liked to see more attention paid to the ones who got us here.
B0049IWQJW|4.0|I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  Nothing too adult about it, but there are a couple good puns only an adult will catch.
0765325950|5.0|THE perfect ending.  The right ending.  Both brutal & beautiful.  This book is less of a story and more of an experience.  For true fans of the WoT, this is it.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Sandra Bullock does a great job in this. And I love that the story line is true,  Reminds us that one person really can make a difference in someone else's life.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it... first thing I go to each morning. The reading plans help give me direction of where to start.
B007CEWR62|5.0|Have been a fan of Secret Garden for years and this latest cd did not disappoint. Beautiful. Downloaded on my Kindle 2 and it sounds good, but still like using better speakers for better sound. Earphones are really good too. Still, I miss having a cd to play in the car. First time I've downloaded on the Kindle. It was very easy.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great second book. Keeps you looking for more.<br />Will read the next book in the series as soon as possible.
B005I6EU48|5.0|Ordered this with my new Kindle Fire and am very pleased with the purchase. Has more of a book feel. Cover is soft but also sturdy. The Fire fits tight into the elastic straps and has yet to slip out. Has a pocket on the reverse side that I use for a notepad.  Good protection for my Kindle purchase and was well worth the money.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is very similar to Helicopter, but with an amazing upgrade. The features and level design are done very well. I could play this thing for hours.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Have read this many times and still have not tired of the story. How we all need a 'secret garden' to escape from the stress of this world. Good for kids of all ages, even those of us with graying hair.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|FIRST TIME BUYING BRUNO MARS GREAT CD HAVE PLAYED IT AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES  I AM A FAITHFUL ROCKER BUT LOVE THIS CD
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story brings forth every emotion.  It forces the reader to experience the book physically.  It is very well written and has a beautiful way of guiding the reader to experience the world through the character's  thoughts and views. It is often witty and smart. I highly recommend it.  I couldn't put it down.  One of my new all-time favorites.
B009P5S11G|1.0|UNLIKE HER LAST ITEM THIS ONE WAS A MESS OF WHAT SEEMED LIKED LEFTOVER B-SIDES DIAMONDS IS THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON THE CD. WHAT THE HELL HAPPEN SHE HAS MORE TALENT THAN THAT!
B005GFPZYK|1.0|This book was more about a person telling how bad they are instead of a person doing a job for there country. Just giving someone a licence to kill and brag about it because they were in the position to do so is not much of a statement for our military. This is not the kind of book to give our troops an image of respect they deserve.
B0071WQ7WU|3.0|REALTIONSHIPS ALWAYS SEEMS TO MAKE THERE WAY ONTO SOMEONES CD NOT THE USUAL STUFF I EXPECT FROM SHINEDOWN. DUMP THE GIRL GET BACK TO THE MUSIC
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|This movie had alot going for it with &#34;Time Travel&#34; and a good plot.  The first half of the movie was good, but as the movie went on, I felt like it just got weirder and weirder and the violence was over the top.  I like a good movie with action etc, but this one I would pass on! The whole shooting children on movies is too weird and kinda sick to me.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Arnold tells it like it is.  He is very open and he has a very interesting story to tell.He is a true action hero
B009MO57H6|1.0|up till now the movies have been great. a couple maybe tv movie but still great.<br />THIS one - I was badly disappointed !  did they just string all the cuts into this version ?  sooo broken up the story got lost. directing was bad, zip on story line!  went out of their way to make toooo many mistakes.  must have been a new intern crew - the producers probably said - throw it together and we will make money due to the following these have -  yeah - well - not from me anymore. I will wait till they come on tv before considering purchase !

0765325950|5.0|First, shame on all the people that gave a 1 star review because the e-book isn't out yet.  The rating should be based on the book, not what format it may or may not be available in at a particular time.<br /><br />As for the book (and the series)itself...<br /><br />I thought this was a very satisfying conclusion to such an epic series.  Some people complain that it was a bit long winded, but IMO what's the rush, I enjoyed all the details and getting to know the characters and the world.  Overall most of the loose ends were wrapped up pretty nicely, and there was a good sense of completion to the story.<br /><br />Well done.

0446520950|5.0|\\"Total Control\\" is my 2nd Baldacci book and as with the 1st, \\"The Winner\\", I was very entertained.<br /><br />I have to admit, being technically challenged, that it was a slow read for me to begin with. There were many aspects of the story that I just didn't understand, but the book and characters were so entertaining that what I lacked in understand of story was made up in rooting for Baldacci's characters of Sidney, Jason & Lee.<br /><br />I have loved Baldacci's strong women in the two books I have read, but I have also liked their vulnerabilities. With every strength we have weaknesses and Baldacci's characters have both. He brings both the good and the bad to light so as to make his characters very believable. Also, I love the fact that Baldacci doesn't have to always give us \\"happy endings\\". In the two Baldacci books I have read to date, I have loved many of the characters and hope to see some of these same characters again in future books.<br /><br />After reading my 1st Baldacci book last month, I set a goal in 2013 to read all of his works. After reading \\"Total Control\\", I loved it so much that I am not deterred from that goal and look forward to reading more. Next up is \\"Absolute Power\\".

007174889X|2.0|Before to go forward and consider buying this book, think why would you need such a book.<br />Harrisons is never meant to be a study material, its just a reference book.<br />Whenever you do not understand a disease pathology or physiology, go and read it in harrisons, you may or may not understand.<br />That`s what this book for.<br />Dont be fooled by all the saying, the most-read book in medicine.<br />This is not true.<br />Think before you buy it.<br />I took very long time to find a note about one disease i was exploring.<br />I would not consider buying it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is just amazing! It is no surprise all the five star ratings. The characters are simply adorable together. They fit each other perfectly. Holder. Oh my word, he was just the perfect hero! This book will make you laugh out loud, and shed a tear for Sky.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works great! wasn't expecting the detail on how much different activities used the battery..I downloaded it for my phone also ( started with a tablet)..Will download again if I get another smart device! highly recommend it...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Totally addicted.  Dying for the next episode. Great to be able to watch on my ipad and cheaper than iTunes
B008TRUDAS|1.0|No Story line looks like it promoting teacher/student relationships. NOT GOOD!! It was offensive; had to stop reading. The mere fact this was Printed..I find sad!!
0765325950|3.0|I am not a professional reviewer and will not act like one as so many on here do. Suffice it to say I have read the Wheel of Time since the beginning, many times and am a huge fantasy nut.<br /><br />Impressions: The book comes across more Sandersen than Jordan. It is MUCH more noticeable than in the previous two books. Take that as you may. The battle scenes are great, yet, even with breaking the finale into three books, the ending feels rushed. There are so o many characters that were developed and plot lines left hanging that an entire trilogy could be made to cover them. That is pretty unsatisfying. The ending as it pertains to the main stuff though is good.<br /><br />As a huge fan this long, it just stinks to get that \\"dilly dally along for 800+ pages then RUSH RUSH RUSH\\" feeling. Get the book, of course, but don't expect all your questions to be answered or to see all your old friends, especially in any depth or character.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book. Many characters to follow along with in the 3rd person. I really enjoyed it. Purchased book 2 immediately.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|Both times that I have seen \\"Les Miserables\\" on stage, in 1990 in Boston, and then years later as a school play at my daughter's high school, several things have always perplexed me about the play - while the songs are beautiful, and the themes of poverty, crime, justice, struggle, love, hope, sacrifice, and redemption are gut-wrenchingly timeless, the play itself was always for me hard to understand.<br /><br />Singing every single line of dialogue in the play can be utterly confusing, especially when four or more people are singing/saying different things at the same time on stage.  And please don't laugh, it was not until the Internet matured and I was able to look up the story of the play that I finally understood the ending of the play.  Why are all those people who had died earlier gathered around and singing at the barricades again?  Because, you see, I had actually read \\"Les Miserables\\", the book, years earlier, and that was soooo not in the book.<br /><br />Tom Hooper could have made this movie any number of ways, and his directorial choices are outstanding.  As such, he should have been nominated for the Oscars for directing.<br /><br />The best choice of course, was the one to have the actors sing live during filming, rather than lip synching and recording separately.  The result is better than what could have been achieved with live singing onstage in a play - the singing in a theater play is still constrained in that the songs have to be sung with enough volume for the entire theater, which eliminates the ability to do the emotional soft whispers that add so much to songs such as \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" or \\"Valjean's Soliloquy\\".<br /><br />Another great choice was to pick great actors for the main parts.  A lot of people nitpick about the singing voices of Russell Crowe or others in this movie, but first and foremost, for this movie to work, it was necessary that great actors who fit their roles be picked for their parts; thus a commanding figure such as Crowe needed to be present to balance the star power of Hugh Jackman in their opposing roles as Javert and Valjean.  I thought the choices for all of the actors were terrific.  Considering that die-hard Les Miz fans cannot agree on who they think is the best ever singing performance for the various audio CD editions of \\"Les Miserables\\", it is easy to discount such critics of the singing voices here in this movie as nit-pickers who have lost sight of the overall needs of this movie.  Ann Hathaway and Hugh Jackman are simply outstanding, and Daniel Huttlestone (Gavroche) and Aaron Tveit (Enjolras) nearly steal the show with their performances.  Isabelle Allen is adorable as the young waif Cosette, Amanda Seyfried is gorgeous as adult Cosette, and Samantha Barks makes for a fine adult Eponine.<br /><br />Finally, the best directorial choice was the combination of large, sweeping visuals together with tight closeups for solos, and sequential cutaways during the multiple-voice singing parts.  These technical choices take full advantage of the power of film over that of the stage - the ability to show the large and grande scenes of history while also bringing in up close and personal the emotions of the characters, and to tease out the complex singing parts into their individual voices.  It elevates the \\"Les Miserables\\" musical franchise into a far grander and more accessible, personal, and emotional experience than the stage version ever could.owe needed to be present to balance the star power of Hugh Jackman in their opposing roles as Javert and Valjean.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Much better book and back to what we expect from Vince Flynn.  Great details and twists.<br /><br />Loved it.  Could not put it down!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I am a huge fan of the previous Bourne movies and was somewhat skeptical about this \\"legacy\\" movie. Jeremy Renner does a great job, he is an actor that keeps improving and is very credible as a \\"Bourne\\" lead. The storyline was pretty good, Ed Norton well cast as the bad guy from the Federal Government. Rachel Weisz was a real disappointment however, she is usually a great actress but in this was totally unconvincing not helped by some pretty slack writing for her character. The worst part of the movie was the endless formulaic chase at the end. It just dragged on and on with none of the tension or believability of other Bourne movies. And then... the movie ended, very strange. Maybe it was a setup for a sequel but it left me feeling like I had seen half of a movie. Much better to restart the franchise with a good solid movie and build on that rather than the weak ending which is offered here.
B00AY9RV90|3.0|Soooo....these songs were not the ones that weren't good enough to be on WFTSC, nope...they were just the leftovers...well...there is a reason they were leftovers...and I ain't buying Sumner's story that they just ran out of songs to do a double album...these are complete crap...I thought Dracula's Castle was shit, but it's absolutely stunning compared to the steaming pile of dung that is LS....<br /><br />And this is coming from someone who actually likes New order, but this is one that's better left alone....
B00870Z9HY|1.0|Very little makes sense in the plot. Just for starters, if Christine is &#34;the soprano of the century,&#34; then why is it that New York is the only place she can come to be paid to sing? And why did Raoul go from hero to zero?  The recurring themes in the lyrics do not connect to any complexity of the human experience (&#34;The heart can't be fooled, The heart is too wise.&#34; really?). Perhaps I'd rather see Starlight Express again- at least then one could be amused by the roller skating.
034580404X|5.0|The books are not a smut book but a romance story. Very interesting read was very captivating and at times difficult to put down.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I'm not sure if I should read this book to my child. It's in places violent, others sexual. And why did Jesus kill a fig tree? Buddha would never do that.

B00495ZE6M|5.0|Of all the books about cats. Simon's Cat is the actually what I think, ok, no, what I know, cats are thinking, doing, and pretending.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved reading the book up until the end.  It just ended without closure.  Maybe it will continue in a 2nd book for the conclusion.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Who is this Jonas Jonasson! Wow, what a great read.  it was very, very fun, one of the most cleaver plots I've ever seen. A great look at world history from the middle of the 20th century through today's events.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|While I figured Phil Phillips would do well, I was not one of his biggest fans on AI.  I was worried that his music would end up being a bit boring and sounding all the same.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this not to be the case.  I've listened to the CD a number of times now, and I'm starting to like it more and more every time.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I can see why this was a big time best seller.  I grew up hearing about the events surrounding WWI, I had three different grandfathers who were a part of it. This book put that war into perspective and the world wide social and political changes that occurred because of it - many of these social and political changes are still evolving.  Mr. Follett did a masterful job of developing just the right set of characters then tying their lives all together to witness all the world changing events of the first half of the 20th century.
0375703764|4.0|The book can some times make literally no sense whatsoever. But when you do finally understand it, you'll definitely love it. It's a great idea.
B005KELW26|5.0|I bought this when I was planning to get a Kindle Fire HD.  I changed my mind and bought a Paperwhite instead.  The cover is a tad big for the Paperwhite, but it is in no danger of falling out.  Now I don't have to worry so much about toting my Kindle around and tucking it into a purse or carry-on bag.  Another advantage to covers - when multiple people in the home have Kindles, it's so much easier to identify yours.<br /><br />Edited to add:<br />After 3 years of use - opening and closing, being shoved into purses and suitcases - the tab that holds the folio closed came off.  I am not taking away stars on the item because I feel that 3 years of use wasn't a bad run.

B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I could not get through it and gave up half way through, poorly written and not well developed. Pretty much a waste of time!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It's a hard book to read, the one that you know will end sadly, but it is rewarding. There's a spectacular thing about this love story. It's real, it doesn't try to hard, nothing happens easily, lives are lived, and lives are lost. It is our world.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It being in the form of letters really helped understand the feelings of the narrator. I see nothing wrong with the book. It's honest, real life and touching. One of the best books I've read.
1442354747|5.0|This audio tape/book was a very educational and entertaining listen.  I gained a much better understanding of the political times and situations leading to Lincolns nomination and presidency. It added a lot to my appreciation of Lincoln as the great president and leader that he was.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Very funny and will probably buy the DVD. Although it will probably appeal mostly to men, my wife enjoyed it too.
B001ET5WU4|5.0|My original album was very scratched on one side, and I was so happy to be able to preplace it with a new, great sounding one.  The enjoyment continues.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I thought the earlier seasons were quite funny.  As the actors have matured into their rolls and become more comfortable with each other the comedy has really gotten better.
B002RI9UBS|3.0|Enjoyed heaps although slow in some parts, didn't want to put down during others. Detail is amazing and makes you forget it's fiction. Worth reading.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I gave this four stars because it's an extremely fun game at a good price. I play it on my galaxy tablet and it works great. It's not HD clarity like on my daughters iPad but it's definitely good enough to play.

Now she has her own set which she loves even more than the original legos because of all the pink and purple legos included.  she loves the treehouse idea too....what kid doesn't love a great treehouse?<br /><br />great lego product--same great quality, directions, etc.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for legos for a girl
0312370849|5.0|So well written I stayed up late, really late to read.  The current day and the history connected very well.
0765325950|4.0|I'll admit that, after the last few books by Brandon Sanderson, I had really high expectations for this book. This was sold to fans as the final chapter in the Wheel of Time, and after so many years, so many highs and lows in the roller coaster of this series, I wanted SO BADLY for this to be perfect.<br /><br />It was an unrealistic expectation on my part, but my enjoyment of this book suffered for it. I won't spoil anything, but even though this book covers The Last Battle, there was too much fighting. It grew tedious to slog through yet another description of yet another plight facing the Armies of the Light. The scenes in and of themselves were very well written, but it became boring quickly, and I skipped over whole chapters and didn't miss anything truly important.<br /><br />I also thought that Rand's final days before confronting the Dark One were a mixed bag of cliche's that didn't really hang very well. In fact, pretty much everything Rand did before the fight was contradictory or meaningless, so I didn't really feel that connected to him or get that drawn in to his battle. I was hoping for a more... poetic and dignified parting with our hero.<br /><br />One final flaw: I was getting sick to death of the rampent distrust and paranoia of nearly every character in this book by the time I finished. It seemed like every time someone said or did anything, someone was calling them a darkfiend, or saying they lost their mind, only to find out that, well, maybe they were right. By the time the Last Battle started, I was actually hoping for a few main character deaths, just to get things moving. It was an attempt to add desperation and anxiety to the story, but it just annoyed me.<br /><br />NOW, some positive notes:<br /><br />Mat really comes into his own in this book. I would have liked to have spent a little more time with his character, because the emphesis was no longer on him being a gambling manwhore who magically pulls battle strategy out of nowhere and more on him as a young man. Mr Sanderson did a great job in polishing the color and personality of a character I had previously found to be too two dimensional. I was glad to see Mat get the spotlight and shine.<br /><br />Loial and the Olgier were very well portrayed as well, though they have only brief moments in the story.<br /><br />I was VERY pleased with the fate of Moghedien! Some of the Forsaken were robbed of having as grand a part in this book as they deserved, but Moghedien got what she deserves, and then some!<br /><br />All in all, I liked this book. I HATED reading it in hardcover, because I've gotten so spoiled with the Kindle, and while I was disapointed somewhat, this book accomplished what it set out to do: Draw the epic saga to a close. I expect there will be an expanded universe opened up in the next few years, with tales from the New Age and tales that cover details from this one. I also expect that the next major series in this universe will be the prequal covering the Age of Legends, since it had such an impact on this series, and I wouldn't mind a short story or twelve covering Mordeth, the Rise of the Seachan Empire, or any of the other hundred thousand strings left hanging!
B005HSL626|4.0|It was fun...great game for my son...but it is a little boring for me...wish there was more to do yea
B009NQKXYK|3.0|story too fractured, not much character development, it's as if they tried to combine ideas from other sci fi movies and do too much.
B009AMALGM|1.0|My boyfriend and I have watched all of the Paranormal Activity movies, and we thought this movie was the worst of the \\"found footage\\" genre, much less of the series! First of all, it took about 40 minutes for anything remotely \\"scary\\" to happen, and even that was a crapshoot. The only thing about the film that I liked was the Xbox Kinect ir lights, because at least THAT was something different. The ending was horrible, we get it supposed t be about a cult, but it didn't even make sense! (Don't want to include spoilers...then again I can save anyone who reads this about 13$) Overall, this movie was only made for the suckers, (i.e. my boyfriend and I) who would buy this movie thinking it would be as good as the others. Wait for netflix to have it, it's just not worth the money.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Probably one of Carol King's best albums, and certainly her most accessible. Lovely harmonies on several of the songs. This is a very significant album from the acoustic pop era of the early 70's.
B0082Z447U|3.0|After reading a &#34;modern&#34; novel beforehand which was well paced and in the vernacular of &#34;today&#34;, I found The Woman in White rather old fashioned in both the content and style of writing. Never-the-less, I was intrigued enough to finish it.

B008DGUT8Q|4.0|Enrico Rava play Michael Jackson&iexcl; probably the more strange ECM production ever. Rava play great and simple arranged of Michael Jackson music, in live. Great band, great moments of music but strange for Rava feelings. Is nice, but not great. Is something between Brecker Brothers, Jackson and Rava. The four stars are for the singularity of this \\"unique\\"ECM colaboration. Really strange this kind of pop music in this ECM catalog, but fine at least, specially the Chaplin song, this one is great. Specially interesting for Rava fans. He is great even with this kind of material
B003L77GH4|2.0|I ordered the first three seasons on DVD because I am a huge TVD fan, and received my order on time. However, I was very upset to find that the case for the season 2 box set had a large slash in the plastic protection screen on the actual case, that began on the front of the case in the top right corner and ended on the back of the case in the middle. The discs and box are fine and in new condition, but the tear on the case is upsetting. I take great care of all of my TV box sets and have never had a problem with product quality before. Either way it was very disappointing.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I absolutely adore these head phones. The range on them is incredible and the surround sound in consuming.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|About twenty years ago I was in morning rounds with other young Doctors when the air was suddenly filled with the sound of electronic baby crying.  One of the lady residents reached into her pocket and pulled out a small hand-held device and punched a button with her finger.  The crying stopped.  Everyone in the room stared at her for a moment before she said \\"he was hungry.\\"<br /><br />There is some human pleasure center stimulated by \\"simulated life.\\"<br /><br />That is kind of sort of the point of this \\"game\\".  You don't compete.  You can't \\"win\\".  There are no enemies to kill and no foes to vanquish.  You can't pit your mind against an internet opponent.<br /><br />You can only build your Ice Age Village - an ice flow that you populate with everything from dung beetles and earthworms to rhinos and dinosaurs.  You surround your simulated critters with a playground that would have been the envy of Michael Jackson - roller coasters and movie theaters (where you can conveniently watch trailers for \\"Ice Age\\") and bungee jumps, etc. At predetermined times,  the critters and amusements pop up coins that you collect.<br /><br />Other than \\"building\\" your village the \\"point\\" (if there is one) of this game is collecting fake currency: gold and silver coins, \\"love\\" (in the form of little pink heart icons), \\"experience\\" (in the form of blue stars) and the most valuable currency of all: acorns - in honor of the ubiquitous saber-toothed squirrel, Scrat.  This in-game simulated currency can be used to.... buy MORE simulated critters and their accoutrements.  If you're not happy with how fast you're accumulating coins and acorns on your own, the developers have added the insidious ability to use your OWN actual hard-earned cash to buy acorns, etc.  I'm plenty content with the coins I've acquired using only the free game.<br /><br />I should have long ago bored of this thing but: 1. the artwork is engaging and entertaining and if you're only playing the game a few minutes a day it doesn't seem like THAT big of a waste of time and 2. I LIKE collecting the simulated currency.  I should have quit before the first week - now I've been playing over a month and I'm currently level 39.it doesn't seem like THAT big of a waste of time and 2.

All of thee albums sound great.but when I first discovered &#34;Songs of Faith and Devotion&#34; I was for an understatement both pleased and speechless. For one, it's the only album that sounds completely different, and for two,... It has (opinion) thee best sound (not only in depeche mode , but in most music) from the melodies, to the high endowed vocals, and from Martin's sincere emotions to Alan, FLood, and Fletch,s ambientic/intense soundscapes make this one of the most important albums not only of the 1990's but also in the 20th century.dont believe me? Try it yourself. It'll always be worth the buy and the listen every time. Timeless and endowed. No more reviews...... This sums up the album (and only a tad summary at best :) ) thank you
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|The most recent update (1/15/13) ERASES your game data!  This is the second time this has happened and it is UNACCEPTABLE!  I've never had this problem w/Google Play, so I must conclude that the problem  is with  Amazon!  What is also unacceptable is having to be logged into your Amazon account (which means you're also online) in order to run this (and other apps).  It is unfair and unecessary.  PLEASE FIX THIS!!!

B008B8DY2O|3.0|The story itself is interesting for the most part, but drags on a bit and i find it hard to concentrate on the content all the time.  It does however give a good insight into life in India. The book got such high reviews that I expected a more enjoyable read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book took a bit to get into just because I don't normally read romance books about under aged children. But I'm glad I stuck with it because it captivates you about a fourth of the way in and doesn't let you go. Very good storyline that has unexpected twists and turns along the way.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|In a day and age where Hollywood seems to be taking wonderful things from my childhood and destroying them through sheer stupidity (see The Chipmunks, for instance) it's always refreshing to see someone do it right. After The Muppets were successfully brought back last fall I wondered if Tintin would be done the same justice. I was skeptical and missed this film during it's theatrical run. After deciding to pick it up on Blu-Ray I can wholeheartedly say that The Adventures of Tintin didn't disappointment and took me back to those summer days of watching the old cartoon series.<br /><br />For starters, the performances and direction in this film are stellar. The voice work of Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, and Daniel Craig are excellent and they give breath and life to these characters. They've believable and instantly connect with you as soon as they appear on screen. The motion capture is perfect and the voices flawlessly match up with the action in every sequence. Though it's computer animated and the situations themselves are somewhat unbelievable, there's still a sense of verisimilitude that draws you in and makes the world these characters inhabit a bit more personal and realistic. The story moves quickly and I was amazed at how much time flew when watching this film. It clocks in at an hour and forty-six minutes, yet it feels much shorter because of the pacing. Sometimes that kind of quick pacing and constant jumping around can hurt a film but in the case of Tintin it works in the film's favor. From the opening street chase to a battle aboard a ship to a thrilling motorcycle chase, every scene flows together and each one feels tight and necessary.<br /><br />Having John Williams do the soundtrack was a great idea and it's another solid score from the man whose music perfectly incapsulates adventure and intrigue. The fact that Peter Jackson produced and Steven Spielberg directed makes for a perfect duo and I can't imagine another other team being able to pull this kind of project off. Their enthusiasm and passion for the genre and source material is evident in every frame. It's great to see a film that families can enjoy together. Don't get me wrong, I love dark and gritty films, but sometimes it's just refreshing to see a movie that relies on great characters, an engaging story, and fun set pieces in place of artsy styles, violence, and f-bombs.<br /><br />The Adventures of a Tintin is a breath of fresh air and the news that a sequel is in the works has me excited. This is a film that warrants not just its own sequel but it's own franchise. The comics leave plenty of material to draw from and Tintin is a great character that has room to grow. This film made me smile and brought me back to my childhood. It's upbeat, fun, beautiful to look at, and safe enough for kids while being smart enough for adults. This is one I enjoy returning to again and again.nd of project off. Their enthusiasm and passion for the genre and source material is evident in every frame.

B0084U0IEG|3.0|I didn't enjoy this latest novel of Ian Mcewan's as much as his other books, although it is a fascinating subject, as are most of his books. In my opinion the plot was too unbelievable. Beautifully written so well worth the read, but easily put down able.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Borrowed the original book from a friend of mine, and it was a great read.  Then I discovered the second book available for the Kindle Reader, and immediately bought it.  Spent several nights reading it, and now I can't wait for the third book to come out!
B008VDJFFY|5.0|It's been a few months since Layken's dad died and they can no longer afford to stay living on their ranch in Texas. So Layken, her mom and her brother Kel, who's 9, move to Michigan, a move that Layken is really not happy with.<br /><br />As soon as Kel steps out of the u-haul, he has made a friend. A boy named Caulder who lives directly across the street from them. And within minutes, Layken meets his very hot older brother, Will.<br /><br />Over the next few days, they really hit it off, and even go on their first date. But come Monday morning, they're both devastated when they realise that they can't be together.<br /><br />This is an amazing book that filled me with so many emotions. I was laughing out loud, crying heartbreaking tears and tears of joy. This was a book that really tugged the heart strings in so many different directions. This kind of book is not what I would usually read, but having read some amazing reviews, once I picked it up, I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />A part of this that I really enjoyed, which actually surprised me, was the slam poetry. Before beginning this book I had envisioned myself skimming over the poetry sections. But they were well written and I loved the part they played in the book.<br /><br />Lake and Will were both amazing characters that I don't think anyone could but like and feel for. The secondary characters play a significant part in this book, especially both younger brothers and Lake's mother. Eddie (a girl), who quickly becomes Lake's best friend was another great addition. She's had her own hardships in life, but yet she remains perky and upbeat and is always looking out for Lake. The relationship she has with Gavin is sweet and endearing.<br /><br />Read it!!! That's the best advice I can give. Point of Retreat, book 2 in this series is up next for me. And from the blurb, I'm expecting another ride on an emotional rollercoaster.

B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Touching story.  Shows a different side of the characters, and adds dimension.  Great future ideas.  The Bad Guys are nasty!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Ok, so I had heard that something happens in this book. It's not something it's somethings that happen. I am still processing and thinking about this...<br /><br />Colleen is an exceptional writer. She made you feel things that you didn't even want to feel in this book. How do I explain myself. Please bare with me. It was a hard read, for me at least.<br /><br />The true test of an exceptional writer is when you can feel every freaking thing that happens in a book. EVERYTHING! As well as remember and think about it long after you have finished it. I don't want to go into detail with it either. It deals with hard subject matter that had me reeling several different times throughout.<br /><br />Let me just say that my heart physically ached for Sky. I literally felt physical pain for her. I felt for Holder and his loss.<br /><br />Never have I read a book that affected me like Hopeless did. I have felt conflicted about writing this review. I don't ever want to sway anyone from reading a book, ever. Having said that, just know that things happen in life. Real things that happen every day that we may or may not be aware of. Horrible, horrific and cruel things....<br /><br />I'm sorry if this review isn't helpful. But it's honest and from the heart and hit me like a ton of bricks.

B007P06DO0|1.0|Beautiful box and extras, ruined by compression like most modern remasters.<br />Look elsewhere for sound quality like HDTracks version<br />THIS HAS TO STOP PEOPLE!<br />Or else these stupid record companies include so many CDs in the packaging, why not put an extra $0.10 CD in there with a correctly mastered version without compression?

B00A81MV3U|5.0|If anyone has been dismissing Cooper as just a good looking empty headed guy, he dispels that image with this film.  He is onscreen virtually all of the time and gives a very nuanced performance, holding his own very well against his major foil in the film, his father played by Robert DeNiro. Although on one level it might seem that Cooper has other foils, the mental illness problems which the two of them exhibit show that both of them mainly battle with mental illness in both its nature and nurture modes. We have many people in my extended family with various forms of mental illness, going back for many generations, so I really could relate to this aspect of this film. The film takes no judgmental stance when it could have become awfully ponderous.<br /><br />Patrick's (Cooper) OCD behavior about his soon to be ex wife, Nicky, really began to grate on my nerves. I've known people like this, who won't shut about some love object they are stuck on it and it becomes as insufferable to the listener in real life as it does in this film.  However, I would guess that Russell, the director, wanted this reaction as it would be a common reaction to this obsessive compulsive behavior. Certainly it only adds to Cooper's performance.<br /><br />Cooper is up for the Oscar.  He faces formidable opposition from Daniel Day-Lewis playing Lincoln, however.  Even if Cooper does not win, being a nominee is a big step upwards for his career.<br /><br />The romantic part of this film prevents it from becoming a real downer about mental illness. A woman in his neighborhood, Tiffany, was recently widowed.  She is attracted to Patrick (Cooper). They begin hanging out together and soon she agrees to give a letter to Nicky if he participates in a dance competition with her. This woman is ably played by the meteoric  star Jennifer Lawrence. We get to see the dance competition and thankfully they do ok but the film does not turn into SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. The romance part of the movie will be universally liked and should help the film do well commercially. Lawrence is up for the Oscar but there is very stiff competition in this category.  Younger actors, like Lawrence, are also more frequently overlooked in favor of the veterans come awards time.<br /><br />There is also humor to the film, most of it coming from DeNiro with the schemes he hatches relative to his obsession with the Philadelphia football team.  This is so extreme that he has been banned from the stadium. Maybe one shouldn't laugh at his OCD behavior on this but much of it was as funny as MONK doing his OCD detecting.  We all know though that DeNiro has great comic talent and he unleashes it here. He is up for supporting Oscar and I think his chances are very good.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

Many patients will never be able to stop taking the drugs and he is one of them.  I think the movie could have dealt with this aspect better as it is a very important part of mental illness. Note: it is only because he is a criminal in a sentence with a mental hospital subject to a court that a lab test factor could be implemented.  Any mentally ill person not subject to a court's supervision cannot be compelled to do anything.

B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I had one problem with the first season of this show.  I found it extremely improbable that the female CIA agent had gotten through the CIA's background checks with her mental illness problem.  However, in season two, her fellow agents and superiors all know this and they act exactly as I would expect them to act having that knowledge.  They distrust her and don't want to use her.<br /><br />Brody is now in Congress.  He is being groomed as a vice presidential candidate while the current VP would run for president.  His kids now go to the same school as the VP's and his daughter befriends the VP's son. His wife likes the escalation in their lifestyle but still does not like the Brody who returned from the war.  She would rather be with Tom but is trying to do her duty.<br /><br />A new guy is introduced and he is a CIA agent who works with Carrie, Saul and eventually Brody. I thought he was a good new addition to the cast.<br /><br />Our same male and female terrorists are back and they are still hatching plots, which the CIA must thwart. The water gets progressively murkier on whom Brody is working for and this heightens the suspense.  He gets in many tight situations.<br /><br />I frankly don't understand why many viewers were disappointed with this season.  There were only a few avenues which they could use given that Carrie and Brody were both still alive and still our lead characters.  The creative people did a marvelous job on following that avenue.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B004U52VPS|5.0|my grand niece and nephew (and sister in law) had a blast playing this game - perfect for a winter afternoon break from the tv/video games.  amazon delivered in two days during the height of holiday season at a price not to be found anywhere else - tks
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Need I say more? The Fever Series is the best fantasy series written in my humble opinion. Just read one Fever series book and see what you think!
B007THA4FI|2.0|One of my children liked it.  I might like it better another time.  Just have read too many dysfunctional books of late.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I resisted reading this for a year since it sounded like over-blown romance novel and it was. Why can't there be a sexy novel with a protagonist (woman) who isn't a complete passive pushover, weak-minded putz?! Gets pretty repetitive on about page 60 and instead of making me want to read the remaining two in the sequel, it made me pretty much know how they'll go: lustful sex-back-together-break-up-lustful-sex-back-together. Blah blah blah.<br />I think the rage is the descriptive sex scenes, which, frankly are hot at first, then just a little repetitive and get completely unappealing as the main character, Ana, becomes more and more of a loser. If you want to read for the sex, have at it, if you want there to be some semblance of characters you can identify with and story you can tolerate, try The Scarlet Letter.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|It was recommended by a friend and I was non committal, but what a surprise.  I can hardly wait for the next episode.

B00A757EFW|2.0|as a child i loved to play pac-man but this game just didn't do anything for me really. not the worst game but not the best either.
B003VWU2WA|3.0|First, the cord is way too short.  It's maybe 1.5 to 2 feet, and that's just not enough unless you have a USB hub built into your keyboard.<br /><br />I wish there was more competition in this product category.  I certainly looked hard for alternatives before buying this but couldn't really find anything comparable in price and functionality.<br /><br />I'm not really satisfied with my purchase.  The software that you can download to configure the device (assign sensitivity, actions, light behavior) is inadequate.  It doesn't work right about half the time.  I find myself shifting between windows just to get the knob to respond when all I want to do is change the volume.  It pretty much totally disregards the settings you assign to the light, UNTIL you bring the settings window back up.  Then it suddenly remembers again.  Not practical.<br /><br />Also, if you use the thing as a button (handy for muting and unmuting) it will often get stuck in the depressed position, which leads to a puzzling increase in spinning resistance until you figure out what happened.<br /><br />To summarize, the build quality is lacking a bit in that the button often sticks, and the software/support is a joke.  You're almost better off buying a keyboard with a built-in volume knob, which I did, but that's another story (it had sticky keys, though to be fair I could only find it used).

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enjoyed reading about the different perspectives of each character.  The end really surprised me that I wouldn't expect from the author.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a fun and fast pace game that will keep you entertained for hours.I play this all the time and are always entertained. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do. so enjoy this game.

B00991TCOG|5.0|I bought this CD, played it on my stereo, and was impressed. Tonight, three weeks later, I listened to it on my laptop with headphones. I was blown away by everything that I wasn't hearing on my stereo. All of this wonderful, rich, complex musical tapestry began to unfold. Her use of electronica to accompany her violin is wonderful. I haven't enjoyed an album of this type this much since I first heard Enigma's Le Roi Est Mort. Very different styles, but both have a wonderful way of painting beautiful scenery in my mind as I listen. It carries me away to a wonderful place that I hear and feel. This is a talented young lady. I look forward to seeing her live. Piers Morgan was wrong on this one.
8866131024|5.0|I've been using this size planner/journal for three years now. I use then to keep track of what I've done for the day. Small size keeps me concise and easy to lug around. It's really well made and there is some useful information inside. Elastic strap and place marker are handy too.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I never heard of Downton Abbey until I found it browsing. I really liked seasons one and two and so far I am enjoying season 3.
B00190KZUU|5.0|I purchased this because I needed to show it to a class, and left the DVD at home.  This was very easy to download and show on demand.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next one. I have preordered it!!!! It is a great read; one that is hard to put down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Trying to find TV programs that actually help you to become a better person is a challenge. Learning about the customs of the time period resembled in these series it is a refreshing entertaiment, it is a scape from the frantic technology, communication, drive-throught times that we're living on.<br />Downton Abbey is a great production, with actors that lead you to the times,<br />The dialogues are revelant and the vocabulary is rich, proper language at last!<br />I had catched a few episodes in the past, and was drawn to see more of them, but never knew when they would air, but once I found out I could watch them all with Amazon Prime (free), I am able to watch TV that I enjoy.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know where to begin... I just finished Hopeless and it was amazing. Holder is now ranking extremely high in the BBF standings. This was just an awesome story with fabulous characters. I laughed and of course I cried. Mostly I cheered for how strong both Sky and Holder were. Thanks for another fantastic book!!!
B00AMLFJT4|5.0|The songs are really good & kept me going while taking down &#34;Christmas Village&#34;,  all my over decorating over the holidays.  When I need to move I put this on.  It's not G rated so if you're sensitive look for a censored copy.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Engrossing story, at times dragging on and unlikely that any serious walker could make so few miles a day. I liked it well enough to invite my wife to read on my Kindle, thus taking my Kindle out of action for a while. surprise ending and one that was very relevant for me.Unfortunately I wasn't able to attend book group discussion but other in the group expressed their approval of the selction.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|Let me start off by saying in the past week I've found the time to read this book, highlight throughout, then go back through and take notes, so, yeah, I thought it was a pretty spectacular book and much different from the usual fluff I am used to reading these days.<br /><br />As an inside sales person, I assumed Pitch Anything included my business in the mix, but, alas, it just didn't feel that way. The book is catered towards people looking to raise capital, so, if you don't have a creative bone in your body, you may be a bit frustrated at some points trying to figure out how (or how not) to apply a certain bit of advice to your own situation. I've got a few and I am still stuck on how to use a few things in my own business on the phone.<br /><br />All in all, I love the book and find that it's one of those few that applies to nearly every situation we find ourselves in socially (the French Waiter for example) so it should be read, with an open and creative mind, by anyone that wants to pitch anything to anyone, whether it be an idea for a new company, or yourself as a candidate for a job.

B0059XTU1S|5.0|Let me begin by saying I'm the type who is always a little wary of book-to-film adaptions. But, having said that, I always try to put aside any preconceived notions or prejudices I have before I enter the theaters, though sometimes I admit it is difficult, particularly when I am viewing something I enjoyed as much as LotR.<br /><br />I must admit I was a little more wary of \\"The Hobbit\\" than usual. I was very excited for the original LotR trilogy, and was wowed by the film adaption of \\"Fellowship.\\" But being so impressed by the first one made the hack job PJ did on \\"Two Towers\\" and \\"Return of the King\\" even more of a disappointment, so I couldn't help but think of that when I went into \\"Hobbit\\" the first time.<br /><br />I read the LotR trilogy when I was in my mid to late teens, thus the story was still quite fresh in my mind when I saw those films. I read \\"The Hobbit\\" when I was around eight to ten years old, and it scared me into more than one nearly sleepless night. However, even at that age, I could sense the potential in \\"Hobbit,\\" and how it nearly slipped out of Tolkien's control more than once (something which made sense after I read LotR nearly a decade later). I thought about reading \\"Hobbit\\" again before I went to see the film, but I decided the book had made such an impression on me as a child, and I didn't want to have it fresh in my mind making even more of a muddle of my feelings of \\"Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.\\"<br /><br />In the end, I'm glad I didn't. People have made a big deal out of PJ breaking \\"Hobbit\\" into a trilogy, as he did with LotR. I, personally, see a lot of potential in this. There were a lot of things hinted at and lightly touched upon in \\"Hobbit\\" that were important to the storyline but ultimately left unexplored, such as Thorin's past with the Pale Orc. Having the opportunity to explore these lightly touched upon things - as long as it is done carefully and in a way that compliments instead of detracts from the storyline - makes me think PJ did the wise thing in breaking \\"Hobbit\\" into three films as well.<br /><br />As always, the locations used for the filming of \\"Hobbit\\" were characters in and of themselves. Looking at the beautiful scenery and lush colors make it clear why NZ is a popular place for filming movies and television shows of a more fantastical persuasion. As for the actors (and actresses) themselves, they all did a splendid job, with a few breakaways. Gandalf, as always, was a pleasure to watch. Bilbo was a pleasant surprise, with just the right touch of sweet innocence and underlying courage in just the right places in the film. The brothers Fili and Kili were very nearly show-stealers, completely making every single scene in which they appeared. Thorin was an excellent strong but flawed leader, and his actor did a wonderful job balancing the opposing forces of Thorin's personality, never letting one or the other overpower his performance. The interactions among the dwarves, and their individual and group interactions with Bilbo, were nicely done and allowed us a glimpse into the formations of bonds which last a lifetime and beyond among friends.<br /><br />The pacing was very good. Things kept moving along, pausing to elaborate on some things without bogging down the story. The battle scenes, while at times unrealistic (getting smashed by a huge rock and coming out unscathed seemed a tad iffy to me, but it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment), were handled beautifully. A lot of people have mentioned PJ relied on CGI a little too much, but I think in something like this, he about has to or everything looks a little too fake. While there were a few obvious goofs - such as swords which were supposed to be glowing were as cold and dark as if there were no goblins or orcs around, when the weilder was in fact surrounded by them - they did not really detract from the overall enjoyment of the scenes and the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps the best thing in \\"Hobbit\\" was Howard Shore'smusic. Even though my opinion of LotR films in general isn't really that favorable, I have spent many pleasurable hours listening to the music of the films. \\"Hobbit\\" was a nice blend of the familiar and the entirely new, again keeping the balance well without feeling like we were rehashing something which has already been done a thousand times. The inclusion of songs actually taken from the book was very exciting as well, considering LotR did an abysmal job on that count, only including one or two. From the moment I heard \\"Misty Mountains\\" in the first trailer I saw, I knew if nothing else \\"Hobbit\\" would not disappoint with the music, and I was right. The score is a perfect compliment to everything happening on screen, as well as doing a good job standing on its own.<br /><br />As soon as I finished watching \\"Hobbit\\" the first time, I wanted to go back and see it again, and thankfully had the opportunity to do so before it left theaters. I hope it doesn't take long to release on DVD, because this film is definitely worth adding to any movie lover's collection, and most particularly to LotR fans.<br /><br />Whether PJ can hold on to this tenuous balance remains to be seen - after doing such a good job on \\"Fellowship,\\" after all, he blew it big time with \\"Two Towers\\" and \\"Return of the King\\" - but I have a good feeling he'll be able to keep the next two installments of \\"The Hobbit\\" as enjoyable and canonically-complimentary as he did the first.<br /><br />This is an adventure I definitely look forward to reliving again and again!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really couldn't put this one down. It painted the most beautiful pictures, and the story was action packed and full of such fascinating information.

B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I thought this would be an app where my kids would &#34;draw something&#34; instead it is a game where you are competing against another random drawer - disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think this was a very well descriptive book that told a fun, and  great story  I have read all of the hunger games and by far the mocking Jay is the best.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Fun!  Lots to do and cute graphics.  My daughter loves to help me play it.  I wish the quests were a little more varied but still fun.
B0076DELIG|5.0|A page turner in the extreme.  It won't take you long to get through this because it is just too darned good to put down.
B008P9M614|4.0|If you are just looking for every episode of House, and not looking for any special collectors only edition, this will work for you. The thought process behind this product was probably &#34;Lets take the 8 seasons of House, make each season fit into one DVD case, and then design a box for them to fit in.&#34;
B007SSEBCU|3.0|This film is done by flashbacks from an aging (and somewhat demented) point of view...interesting but doesn't move very quickly.  A good film but I thought it was more of a bio-pic from beginning to end.  Starts with her confusion after the death of her husband and works backwards.  Just be prepared for that.
B0058YPL66|5.0|My husband & I started this series and had to start over because the kids got interested as well.  We have all been enjoying this.
B000U0F7RG|3.0|I love Gilmore Girls, it is one of my favorite tv shows, however this collection is less than ideal. The box that they come in is much bigger than I expected. It doesn't fit on a standard sized shelf for DVDs. I am not a very big fan of the packaging, compared to the individual season DVD sets it is very plain. The cardboard slots are hard to get the discs in and out of without scratching them. The content on the DVD's does not justify paying extra, since it is the same as the original discs. Also if you you are hard of hearing, be aware that the later seasons do not have closed captions in English. Overall, I think that buying the seasons separately would have been a better purchase.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I highly recommend it- very inspirational.  It is the story of a basically agnotic neurosurgeon who has a NDE that changes his life.
B0030B1WBM|1.0|If I could give it a star-and-a-half, I would, because I did chuckle once or twice, but I can't, and this movie does NOT deserve two stars!<br /><br />⊕ Umm… when it DOES follow the book, it's mostly faithful; Jim Carrey made me laugh a few times; most of the actors wear so much prosthetic makeup they could potentially deny ever being in this film<br /><br />⊖ Padded with senseless and unnecessary subplots and back-story; nauseating cinematography; uses only two of the original's memorable songs, and this rendition of the title song is just plain awful; &#34;Where Are You, Christmas&#34; is one of the top 5 worst Christmas songs ever; much of the humor is inappropriate for its target audience; ironically criticizes the commercialization of Christmas, while itself being a shameless cash-in of a classic; the Whos' makeup is borderline horrifying
B0031RS2HC|3.0|The first in the Jack Reacher series, it's a good, entertaining read that doesn't tax you too much, but is a great way of whiling away a few hours on a lazy weekend! Amusingly gory in some places, ridiculously implausible in others, but I'll read a few more Reacher books yet, I suspect.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I love the movie and was really happy in how quick it arrived.It is really a great movie especially for the family to watch.
B0031RS4UM|3.0|Indeed, one need never fear when Jack Reacher is near - but much like The Incredible Hulk, this is one guy you won't like much when he's angry! Yet again, our laconic friend lets nothing rattle him, and ends up putting one over the baddies in a suitably over-the-top fashion. Lots of fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|at first I wondered why everyone cared about it and talked about it. but it is fun and addicting. I wouldn't obbsess over it because that's not my personality but is extremely fun and addicting

B007XIC1GI|2.0|Followed the band over the Nine Inch Nails period so I bought the book for some light reading.<br /><br />I read to the end hoping that it would lead to his seeing that he was taking himself too seriously but he just never does.  This is a boring, repetitive account of someone's self-absorbed, destructive adventures at the expense of other people.  There are a couple of amusing parts (like his lists) but really he is trying to make a book out of  nothing.<br /><br />Like every &#34;deep teenager&#34; he seems to think he is the only person to endure rough times or question anything.  Luckily, most &#34;deep teenagers&#34; eventually open their eyes, suck it up, move on to adjust to a reasonable approximation of the life they want in the context of the world they live in.<br /><br />Perhaps some of his self-loathing is a fair judgment.  He is proud of all the wrong things.  This book is a yawn.  I feel intellectually worse off for having read it.
0061992860|5.0|Great little pocket book to carry with you. Will help you conquer whatever problems you face in the wild.  Highly recommeneded. Worth the $$ for sure.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I'm not usually a person who loves dark stuff, but there's just something about this series. Season 1 was awesome, season 2 is fantastic. Love, love, love the characters. I can't wait for more.

B000I9WW0E|5.0|This movie is a classic, have seen it many times.  The &#34;Dude&#34; is truly Zen and the characters and stories def do not follow any traditional Hollywood protocol.  A better part could not have been made for Jeff Bridges.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My daughter loves it.  But it requires a social network to complete tasks. Also the free daily spin isn't always free. . But still good for free game.
B0000714BP|5.0|I really enjoy this movie, and this DVD was great. I had no issues with it at all, and this movie definitely made an all girls day that I recently had more enjoyable!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gripping stuff, tightly written, hard to put down.  Falls apart a bit in the final act, which I found to be too far-fetched.  Not enough, however, to spoil a really solid effort with well-developed characters and brisk pacing.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This installment was better than many, but not as good as the first few of the series.  I will continue on as long as Cornwell keeps writing them.  I love these characters like they are family.
B003UESJH4|3.0|interesting, a little over rated movie, but still interesting now i need 8 more words to describe it..pretty good ?
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this CD a 5 was because I felt it could have done without  the, what I deemed to be, gratuitous profanity. Mars is a unique artists with undertones of Jackson, Belafonte,  and Sinatra, with a generous supply of his own really cool musical personality. Truly a talented artist. I bought his after seeing him perform on SNL (Which he nailed). I feel his unfortunate choice of some, unnecessary vulgar  language really distracts from his talents. Note: Don't pop this in the player with your kids around unless you know whats coming up. (like I did)

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book will take you on a ride as if it were your own life at stake!  Manipulation at every corner.  Imagine living in a world where just being born makes you a target for \\"Murder for Entertainment Television\\". It is an annual event supported by \\"The Capitol\\". Leaves one wondering......could this REALLY HAPPEN?
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I like Steven King, he has a mind that's always working. In this book, a mild mannered teacher from 2011 goes back in time to save JFK from an assassin's bullet.<br />What a great premise! The problem is that you are expected to believe too many things to get to this point. Okay, it's science fiction, and I did like the characters, but god help you if you try to explain this book to anyone else.<br />As King goes, not his best. (I loved 3/4 of Duma Key).<br /><br />Also, a bit too much race relations in the 60's. I lived through that time, and I don't remember the discrimination as described. King is a good liberal, so he sees evil where perhaps it wasn't as bad as he was told. Okay, he's two years my junior, so maybe where he was it was bad.<br /><br />It's a long book, be ready to accept a lot of \\"Just go with it\\" logic.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm glad I read it.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|As usual, Pixar never fails to disappoints people with their films. Brave is a fantastic film people of all ages. The most noticeable aspect about this film (like other Pixar movies) is the animation. I was blown by the High Definition resolution. There was a part in the film in which it appeared to be like it was live-action. While watching the film, the audience may find the Merida's hair to appear just like real human hair. The vivid colors with keep your eyes glued to the television. Also, the story is pretty interesting. Since this is a family movie, people might believe it has the same traditional plot as other films. Brave delivers an interesting synopsis and keeps the audience engaged. The film has a pretty decent score as well. The music is not as great as other Disney films, but still good. Also, the special features include two magnificent Pixar shorts. Pixar shorts are amazing as all the previous ones before: stunning resolution! After watching the film, I would recommend watching the short \\"The Legend Of Mordu\\" (in the bonus content). It is an interesting and relates to the film. If you have enjoyed previous Pixar films, there is no doubt you will love this one as well. Disney and Pixar continues to make films with stunning animation and characters the audience can easily understand.
B004WO57E4|4.0|So far, everything works on Inspiron Windows 7. HOMM2 crashed a couple of time but has been stable after the first couple of weeks.
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|This is the sequel to the original film released in 1982. I must say this film has truly stepped up in terms of visuals. Tron Legacy is a stunning computer graphics adventure. Unfortunately, viewers will get the feeling that the film is missing something.<br /><br />The film's synopsis is rather disappointing and could have been better. The plot takes place after the original film. If you have not seen it, do not worry because the events that take place are not necessary to know what is going on. At the same time, it would have been better if the film had not try to stay close to the original. The plot is trying to explain what happened in a gap of nearly 20 years (between the first film and this one). As it attempts to explains, it weakens the plot. It is hard not to notice because the film tries so hard to explain the history of Tron while having various inconsistencies. On the other hand, the characters that bring livelihood into the original has returned. The concept of a going inside the world of computers is truly amazing and makes the film a fantastic adventure.<br /><br />The best part is the special effects. Since the setting of most of the film is inside a computer world, the special effects illustrate the vividness of the realm. Even though this world is only numbers, Disney wows people with the power of imagination and makes viewers wish they were there. The only disappointing thing is CGI Jeff Bridges. It can be easily seen throughout the film which is the real actor himself and a computer generated young version of himself. The computer graphics are amazing in HD. Unlike other films that rely heaving on CGI, this film's special effects is a core element in making it artwork.<br /><br />Another awesome element is the music. The soundtrack by Daft Punk makes the audience feel like they are in this world described in the film. Daft Punk did an excellent job of creating music that follows the mood of the films from action scenes to dramatic and sentimental moments. Like special effects, the music does an good job at bringing viewers into this world of computer programs.<br /><br />Overall, Tron Legacy will most definitely bring your imagination to life and make you want to wish you were a character in this film. On the other hand, Disney could have done better with the plot that was too afraid to leave the film's origins. It succeed in what the previous film could not,special effects, but sacrificed a potentially good plot to fabricate a history lesson that is not necessary of viewers to know.moments.

B008HK3XKO|3.0|the case itself is nice, decent value, I like the bendy parts that let you stand up the kindle but..... the design of the kindle doomed all case makers. there are buttons on one side, headphone jack on the other side, camera on the &#34;top&#34; and the charging USB and the HDMI are on the &#34;bottom&#34;. So to use this case you need to keep the kindle up-side-down, in the case, if you want to charge the device with the lid closed. This might seem like a silly gripe and it probably is but, I think it's silly that the Kindle Fire HD designers would put things where they did.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Ridley Scott made people fall in love with the Alien films (at least the first two). Now,he really engages us with Prometheus. This film has many magnificent aspects that people will love (if they can see them). Prometheus is a really good and genuine film, but it also leaves the audience guessing too much.<br /><br />This movie is classified as science fiction for a reason. The plot is highly interesting and highly unpredictable. It keeps the audience wanting more. The synopsis is truly amazing. Everything that takes place in the film can be related back to one core concept. As long as viewers remember that, the film should be really intriguing. Also, this is the best aspect of the film. At the same time, it is the most disappointing. The questions that viewers watched throughout the movie barely got answered. They were really replaced by new ones. It keeps you always wanting more, even after the film. This is one of the main reasons why some viewers do not like this film. Honestly, it appears to be Scott's intention to leave the audience wanting more and it fits with one of the themes in the film. But I truly must say to clear any misunderstanding that this film is NOT an Alien film. This is not suppose to relate directly back to the Alien franchise, but it does leave bread crumbs that help viewers understand it's origins.<br /><br />Next, the visuals were amazing. When watching this film in HD, you will love the vividness on the screen. Unlike other sci-fi films, this film did not use heavy emphasis on computer graphics while sacrificing a strong plot. The graphics are stunning and all other aspects of the film are still great. They are realistic and not cheap looking.<br /><br />Finally, the actors are really good. The cast consist of Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, and other actors/ actresses.<br /><br />In general, this film is fantastic for those who want to see something new and different. Most current sci-fi films have weak plots and heavy use of CGI. This film is the opposite. This movie is a true changer for science fiction films with a plot that throws many questions, but leaves the audience waiting (and some frustrated by the wait).y use of CGI. This film is the opposite. This movie is a true changer for science fiction films with a plot that throws many questions, but leaves the audience waiting (and some frustrated by the wait).
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I am absolutley crazy about this series!!  I now have the fist and second season......hope to be getting the third season soon, and the fourth to follow!!
B008RNGCAO|3.0|The book is great but functionality to zoom and move across panels is not great. Have to zoom and scroll along. No chapter makes, but page quality is good.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|It gives me all the music without a full-on musical feel. I've watched this movie more times that I care to admit. The characters are great and they really pull me into their world.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very enjoyable book. If you like romance, you will enjoy this one. Can't wait to see the movie! Nicholas Sparks never disappoints.
B008476HBM|5.0|If you like the classics, you will love this. Wit, drama, and comedy. Amazing.<br />However, if you don't like the classics, you may find the language difficult to get into at first, but I believe you will soon fall in love with these characters.
B00012QKSI|5.0|Loved the movie, definitely fun to watch, and the music is just as fun! If you saw the movie then the sound track is a must.
0756655307|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew for Christmas, a huge comics fan.  From the moment he opened the gift he couldn't stop looking and reading the book. It was a great price, but the reaction from this book made that great price even better. It is nicely bound and visually stimulating.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I bought this DVD for my wife after she saw the movie and fell in love with the love story.  It was shipped on time as promised and well protected.  Great experience.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|My little ones loved it! Laughed out loud! My husband and I also enjoyed watching it....it was not a kids movie that adults are bored to death while watching.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas and I couldn't believe the ENTIRE series was offered in one package and for such a great price!  A definite great buy that was shipped as promised and arrived in protective packaging.
B00198X0VS|5.0|I really liked it. I really enjoy watching movies and this was very entertaining.Hard to say whether  II was better than I. I was just wondering how the girl from the restaurant never knew she was from another planet. I did enjoy it.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|If you don't have to like characters in a book and you don't mind a different approach to fiction, give this a try.  The PowerPoint chapter works fine on android or iPad kindle apps.  Pulitzer Prize worthy...? Who am I to say.  I liked the links between the characters-even if remote and somewhat disjointed.  Not the best book I've ever read but certainly enjoyable enough and unique in style.  No murder mystery or smutty romance. Yay.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome and really great<br />minecraft is the best game I ever played<br />minecraft is so so soooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this show, but it's not too different in plot than any other soap opera. &#34;A stranger comes to town&#34; or &#34;Somebody leaves&#34; are common to almost all stories.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|my toddler loves the music featured in this movie, she dances constantly when it is playing.  I enjoy that I watched this as a kid myself.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Fun to watch with great directing, but self-indulgent, not believable, full of cliched characters whom we don't really care that much about, and a half-baked plot.  It's better than \\"Natural Born Killers\\" if only because it doesn't make you dizzy watching it.  But at the end, what did you really get out of the amusement ride?  Not a lot.<br /><br />About that ending: I would've preferred a \\"True Romance\\" ending, similar to the first one O tells, but with absolutely everyone dying, and no one winding up on a beach.  I'd rather see someone survive the climactic shootout and wind up hiding out in an igloo, now THAT would be an interesting ending.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Love it I love it is so now but would not play it so I had to get it again but it's  still OMG AWESOME
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book took my emotions through a roller coaster ride.  Nail biting, tears, cheers and joy!! Can't wait for 3rd book Entwined With Me.  5 star recommendation. Move over Christian Grey. Gideon Cross is the new sheriff in town =)
B00466HM28|4.0|this machine is great. i suggest you read the user manual before you just plug and play. this little thing is a monster. it great for controlling loops and getting your ideas out!
0316776963|5.0|I've heard Sedaris read a story or two from this book on This American Life, and now every single word I read in this book, I heard from his voice. This is a great book, and I very highly recommend it. Maybe look into buying the audio version to hear him read it to you?<br /><br />Either way, great book, awesome author, excellent stories.
0618918248|5.0|My First Richard Dawkins book I read. I tend to read more of his books in the time to come.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is creepy when u play alone but it's fun I've beat it many times on all modes it's the best game e ever
0810989956|5.0|This has prompts and gets kids thinking about what to write about. If they liked the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books - they will like this!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This series is always a good read, this was my third time reading Mockingjay and it sucked me in the same way it did the first time I picked it up.
B004G6TD8Y|5.0|I love ELP ever since I heard them in concert in 1972. This was the last album I needed to complete all their work. Great combination of classical and rock music.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I just bought my Kindle Fire and haven't figured out how to download the games.  I would be happy to review them  if I could get that done.  Any help out there?  My WiFi is connected but when I navigate to games or apps I just get the same page I used to order.....no instructions for downloading.
B009GED3HS|5.0|My fiancé and I watch this show all the time. So funny, we love it! Highly recommended to anyone who likes to laugh.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I loved it it was Amazing it gives some all of the word I wanted I love dictionary s they r so fun to read dictionaries are so fun because sum words bring back good memories and bad memories
B0085KGGHI|2.0|It was a great DVD. But I did realize it was a DVD. I wanted a CD. It would have been nice if it came with both
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I believe this series is so wonderful it will go down as one of the best dramas of all time.  I think it will be around for many years.  It is so good that people all around are talking about it and how they so look forward to the next episode and hope the series will continue with a Season 4.  I highly recommend buying this wonderful drama.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|One terrific performance !<br />Worth having it !<br />One of the best live performances ever !!<br />If you like Steve Vai, this one is a must !
B00005JM02|5.0|Fast paced, funny, articulate.  Wonderful voiceovers.  Among the best of the genre.  Three generations of my family adore &#34;Finding Nemo.&#34;
B0084U0IEG|2.0|A nicely written book, but the story concerning the British secret service had no suspense. The sex was extraneous and trite.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|To long, uninteresting.  A total waste of the talent of some great stars.  Dont waste  your time. Just another shoot-em-up.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Very good read, had to keep picking it up until I got to the end, and now can not wait for the next one!!
0316228532|4.0|I don't doubt for a second that this book has gotten many negative reviews because it was written by J.K. Rowling.  I've seen complaints about the bad language and inappropriate scenes in this book, but seriously - if this book had been written by anyone else, no one would've cared.  Plus, the language isn't that bad.  I mean, I don't think it's unexpected for a character with a serious drug addiction to use foul language, right?  You cannot compare this book to the Harry Potter series or expect Rowling to handle both stories the same way.  I think J.K. Rowling does a great job at weaving together a story with many different characters and subplots.  One thing Rowling does better than many authors is really make you feel like you're just as involved in the story as the characters are.  It started off a bit slow but that's not completely atypical of novels, and there are a lot of characters which takes some getting used to.  But once you do, the story picks up and really takes off.  I never wanted to put it down!  Rowling can write about politics and family dramas just as well as she can write about wizards - not an easy feat.  Can't wait until she writes another one!
B001VNB54A|5.0|The Pacific can be considered a War series after all is its based on the WWII war in the Pacific, but is much more than that. Here you have the compelling histories of Americans who answered the nation's call and embarked on a extraordinary journey. In a time when everybody wanted to serve their contry by going to war we see every aspect of life back at the beggining and throught WWII. From the brutal scenes of war to life back at the states, The Pacific takes you back to the 1940's.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray edition with its extended features lets you put a real face to the story. The Pacific is based in real life events with real life characters. This makes it more enticing to make a little research about those portrayed in the movie. Word of advise: Do your research after finishing the series, because history does not have an Spolier Alert sign.
0446580848|3.0|Way too much wise-guy John Corey and not nearly enough story. This one was a disappointment from one of my favorite authors.
0553296981|5.0|What can be said that hasn't been mentioned about Anne Frank. This diary tells an inocent story in a dark time for humanity as a whole. You can be present and imagine what it was like for the Frank family and experience what it was like to be persecuted and with nowhere to go. Even though this can be considered a sad story, her spirit lives on in this book.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|It is as if we never left 1990's. Time never moved forward. Nothing happened in the music world. And here we have this wonderful archeological specimen found right out in the open. I wonder, is possible that there really is a flux capacitor?<br /><br />To me, time not moving forward is a good thing. I like Soundgarden, I liked them back in the 90's and I like them in 2012/3. I get this wonderful warm feeling listening to this album. It reminds me of another time, when life was simpler. King Animal is just one of those albums that doesn't offend. It is the perfect continuation of what Soundgarden was doing back in the day. The biggest difference I can tell, the recording sounds a lot cleaner and precise than their old songs. They've learned a lot about the mix and publishing a CD.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you liked Soundgarden in the 90's, and you long for that sound; this is the perfect album.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app was a pleasant surprise.  I purchased this app after receiving a $2.00 credit. I was surprised with The voice level notification.  This feature comes in handy. Thanks
B008NW67E0|5.0|If this was 1980, Mumford and Sons would have released a double album, instead of their two individual albums. But since it is 2013 and nobody does that anymore, they chose to release two albums.<br /><br />This is a continuation of the previous album. Mumford and Sons haven't done anything new, they just continued with their infectious folk, Irish, bluegrass style. These are all happy songs, easy to sing along with, absolutely a joy to listen to. More of the same, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />If I put the two albums on shuffle, it is impossible to tell which song goes with which album. So if you love Mumford and Sons' first album, you will absolutely love this one.<br /><br />If Mumford and Sons decides to publish a third album of the same thing, well that is going just too far. Very few bands ever released a triple album. By the third album it is time for their music to evolve to something new and different. Or they will become the next Jack Johnson.
B005JZBPHS|4.0|I do not like the martirial because some of cd are damge, not clear.  I like the two actress Laurel Holloman and Jeanifer Bear. They are excellence performing.

I would recommend buying the book ...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Second time I read the book, the other two I've read twice as well. I simply love everything about the series, Catching Fire is my favorite book of the three, so I strongly suggest you read it right after this one. The only problem would be finishing the series quickly, it goes both ways because even though it's great it sucks to know it's over. At least we have the movies to look forward to right? Haha
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome set of books! My first purchase for my Kindle Fire and I loved how easy it was. The story kept me wanting more and I can't wait to see if she takes if further into Christian's mind ;-)
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|They already had the first two and loved them so this was the perfect addition to their extensive movie library.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great time killer! The slow rate of growth of dna can be frustrating at times. The news headlines are a little annoying.

B009WO7NQO|3.0|It's ok, not anything to brag about!I liked the first one and Seasons better.  Stop asking for more words when it is not necessay!
B005CKPQHA|1.0|the playback is glitchy and a total POS am pissed that this is so bad. repeat the playback doesn't work so you need to dowload to watch not good at all with the tech side. like the show and wanted to watch it.
B00846REIS|5.0|way better, a little deeper, better plot..not so sleezy and shallow. dont forget the read the second book, cuz the third comes out soon.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|What a shame that, for the English speaking world, we had to start with the third book in this series, rather than the first - but all those of us who have come to love Harry Hole are now looking forward to reading the first two!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|loved this one too. an 18 year old recommended it, and it was good advice. keeps you reading from beginning to end
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I was very excited to read this book, the first in the Jack Reacher series, and discover an author and a character about whom I could become excited and eager to read more..............
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Like in the original Trek, it was in the stories themselves that much of the show's success is to be found. Having improved special effects, the show ran for more than twice as many episodes as its predecessor and had more time to explore wider ranging issues. \\"Angel One\\" covered sexism in a female dominated planet; \\"The Outcast\\" was about a homosexual race; \\"Symbiosis\\"--drug addiction; \\"The High Ground\\"--terrorism; \\"Ethics\\"--euthanasia; \\"Darmok\\"--language barriers; \\"Journey's End\\"--displacement of Indians from their homeland; \\"Bloodlines\\" -- Captain Picard meets a son he knew he never had. And of course there are many alien races depicted throughout the series: the \\"god-like\\" Q; the mercantilist Ferengi, the treacherous Romulans, the honor-bound but temperamental Klingons, the militaristic Cardasians, and the Borg collective- often compared with the then declining Soviet Union. We see strong central dramatic performances by Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard), Jonathan Frakes (First Officer Will Riker), Brent Spiner (Data), and many others.
B005BQNC44|4.0|Poor Jaycee - not a comfortable read, but worth persevering to fully understand 'man's inhumanity to man' (or, in this case, woman!)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Splendid characters with gorgeous scenery, decor and costumes. Storyline covers a time period that is not often done. A treat!
B0055V6EZE|3.0|My girl friend loves House. So I bought this for her as a gift.  She enjoyed it but for myself, not so much.
B004WR125O|4.0|has good range the only con about this product is sometimes it will hiccup and disconnect but most likely its the network great product.
B00797MB0O|2.0|SoOO boring... it was barely worth my multi tasking time... It has no real plot and makes me confused as to why rotten tomatoes gave it such a high score... Anyways, my two cents? Waste of time. Especially if you just wanna watch something fun. It's got maybe one? or two? haha lines, and very anticlimatic. Very predictable.
0553386794|5.0|This book hooked me into the series of ASOIAF. Now I've read all 5 books to date and can't wait for the final 2 to be released. this was my first fantasy novel that I've ever read so I was a little bit hesitant. But it's so much more than just fantasy, anybody who just likes a good book will love this!
B005MMYCY6|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Ii think most everyone will enjoy this film. It is so much fun and also has quite a message, Without being sappy.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pentatonix is outstanding.  I will definitely keep looking for more from this group.  They were outstanding on sing off and have not disappointed on this album, or their first one.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I am new to the Reacher collection by Lee Childs. I must say, I'm a now a fan. Despite his talent, it's sad that Tom Cruise was selected for the role in the movie---the character is far more lethal in the book. That said, I am now on book number two. This series is action-packed from the get-go. Happy reading to you.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and loved it tremendously.  People who loves Abba music and Meryl Streep will just love this movie.  I call it &#34;sing along with Meryl&#34;.  A fun movie with beautiful scenery.  I would recommend it any one.
B0088O11NU|1.0|this game is so hard it is stupid  you obveiously need to be an expert to comlete atleast one level.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|We love this series with the Frye and Laurie team. We have shared it with family members and they enjoyed them also.

B008PWUXQQ|2.0|This cover is protective, cute and I was pleased for the first few weeks; however at that point the velcro closure ripped and it no longer will stay closed. Frustrating for the price.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I enjoyed the fact that the main characters weren't very likeable, like in Alex Gorringe's [[ASIN:B00AYLN9CG Just Me Myself I]], and equally well-written.  A well-crafted thriller.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best series ever that I have ever read in the history of ever and eve and ever it amazing if you love ancient things like I do
B009T3AHDE|3.0|This movie is ok but it's not great. The whole movie takes place in the back of his limo...just about. It kinda reminds me of Phonebooth in that way. It just didn't keep my attention like most movies I watch do. On the plus side Robert Pattinson was the main character...that's why I give this movie 3 stars. The only reason. I was pretty disapointed :(
B003WUYRGI|3.0|As I went through this book, I came upon many long lettered words. Even though the information was quite helpful, it didn't help the fact that I myself cried a little trying my best to read the words. I would certainly recommend this book to other people and would even like to have the chance in using it again. For a paper, essay, or such things like that. Either way thank you for taking the time to read this note that I send to the program, companies, author, or whoever is reading this. I wish you a the best to read this an  hopefully one day you will a book that a person like me could read at ease. Thank you and good day to you.<br /><br />  Sincerely,<br />  Sad Girl...p.s. this is just a nickname! I didn't get depressed just because I couldn't read a boo!

B008RTE09S|2.0|Must have the wrong country codes. Would not run until I installed my copy of SlySoft on my computer. Good DVD if you can get it to run on your computer. I do not have the latest DVD playback software. That could also be the problem. Playing on a computer. Maybe OK on a Blu-Ray player.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book and would recommend it to any one who likes Greek and Roman mythology. I will definitely be excited when the next one comes out. :)
B000I9WW0E|5.0|Excellent video and sound. The movie speaks for itself. If you haven't seen before you probably would not be buying it.
B008458O3S|2.0|Not accept able to force me to log in to Amazon servers in order to be able to usethe game. Game iis good but can't use all the time.
0439023513|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two books and was so looking forward to this last one.  I started out okay but quickly fell apart.  It was like we had a personality shift in the main characters.  The end was seemed like the author ran out of story so she just killed everyone off without adding anything to the story.  Not sure where all the five star reviews come from?  Did you read the same book? Ended up feeling depressed instead of inspired.  I would totally advise you to skip this one or at least the last third of the book.
1554072840|4.0|My daughter is a little over 2, and our pediatrician recommended this book to us at our 2 year annual checkup.  I gave it to my daughter for Christmas and &#34;the pee pee book&#34; is now her favorite.  She is starting to understand the concept.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|People who have a difficult time believing in Christ and a life beyond this earthly one would benefit greatly by reading this book.  Even better, it is written from the experience of a neurosurgen who has devoted his life to continued and advanced studies of the brain.  Only someone like this could write this book.  And I'm glad he did!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I love this one so beautiful and graceful love to play it to my baby when I'm taking her for a walk in the stroller to help her calm down
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Better than the first....Cant wait for the third one.  I didn't think I would remember all the story lines, but I did....What a crazy world it was back then and certainly continues to be.  So scary what everyone went through and how difficult life was....Follett is awesome....
B002XHN776|5.0|They're great and so original too, it makes me happy and energized all at once when we listen to this

B009FB3XTA|5.0|Can't wait until it comes out on DVD also sad that it's the end. Some songs I can live without but it's perfect for the movie.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie is a holiday tradition at my house. The movie is mostly slapstick but has some truly funny dry humor in it as well. I picked it up for around $5 on Amazon - a price that couldn't be beat elsewhere.  A great movie choice when you want something with a light-hearted holiday theme.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I've played this so many times some songs have gotten on my nerves just like when you hear one on the radio too much, but I love it soooooo much, Paramore is awesome! It also introduced me to artists I wouldn't of found on my own.

B009XTF8JM|5.0|The film centers around a family led by Sam and Dean's Dad and the Closer, they have the unfortunate luck of stumbling across a box and all hell breaks loose. Unfortunately Sam and Dean's dad does not have his particular set of skills yet, so his family is terrorized.<br /><br />The end.

B002KYXO7A|5.0|Although an older movie, Singing In the Rain was near the top of the 100 best movies of all time survey.  It is a musical, and a comedy.  The plot deals with the switch from silent to talking movies in the 1920's with all of the humorous situations that could result.  With lots of singing, dancing, and comedy throughout, it is a delight to view and enjoy.  We had seen it before, and will see it again and again.

0321886518|5.0|This is a revision of my original petty review, which had only two sentences and rightfully got several neutral votes. I hope that all who chance upon it are helped by it.<br /><br />***<br /><br />PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS<br /><br />\\"After God, Shakespeare has created most.\\" The great James Joyce, King of English prose, says that in Ulysses, quoting Alexandre Dumas. And TS Eliot: \\"Dante and Shakespeare divide the world between them; there is no third.\\" Universal consensus names this lad from Stratford, an illiterate glover's son, one of the largest creative intellects that ever lived, a luminary of mankind, as great as the supremely gifted Old Testament authors, Homer, Jesus, Plato, Muhammad, the offspring of the Islamic Golden Age and the geniuses behind ancient Greek thought and Tang Dynasty Chinese poetry. Like Mozart and da Vinci, he remains a miracle: one of those rarest of instances where a supreme intelligence joins with an inexhaustible imagination, passion, tolerance and empathy in the same soul. If Dante is the Poet of the Sacred, Shakespeare is the Poet of the Human. There is the Bible, the Qur'an, the Gita, the Dao De Ching, divine revelations to fallen man. And there is Shakespeare: fallen man revealing himself to himself, Hamlet and Falstaff alike. The human soul coming to know itself in the working-house of its own despair and absurdity.<br /><br />Yet comparisons & praise are odious. On to the review.<br /><br />Among these complete works, which shall we moderns purchase? I'm not truly so learned in this matter, but I'm pursuing a career in higher education and my principal area of study is Shakespeare and Renaissance dramaturgy. I'll also start working on a biographical novel of Shakespeare's life not too long from now, after the mountains of research are finished. He's been close to my heart for a long time, since I was a boy and tried to make sense of Brutus and Hamlet from an old edition from the '20s, and I can paraphrase Erasmus in saying that with what money I earn, I buy my Shakespeares; if I have any left, I buy food and clothes. I hope to at least steer people toward what might be 'their' edition of choice, and do so in as unbiased a way as possible. Everyone approaches the swan of Avon differently and each edition caters to different needs and assumptions, different ages and levels (though all have students in mind). Many rivers run into the same sea.<br /><br />PRICING<br /><br />I'll start with the pragmatic matter of PRICING, which in this hyper-inflated day and age ought to be relevant to all but billionaires. Books usually cost six times as much as they cost to make: the 600% profit, =/-100%, is a cornerstone fact of the publishing industry. Sometimes the Bevington sells on Amazon for $65, sometimes for $95. Originally it was in the $90s but I guess most people, students especially, were turned off by this fat price and opted for the cheaper Norton instead. Then it became $65, entirely more reasonable, and it's been wavering between the two since. Wait for when prices go down to $65 to buy it; don't waste your money. Save your hard-earned $30. No book deserves upward of $80 dollars unless it's a first folio or an original manuscript from Nag Hammadi. Or an Atlantean magical inscription on the sea-bottom. Usually the Riverside doesn't go below $80, and the Norton alternates between the high $50s and about $70. The RSC is reasnably cheap at around $47 on Amazon Prime. Again, wait for the $65-ish Bevington, unless you have the $90 or so to spend on the Riverisde or Bevington as it is when it's more expensive, either of which will last you for decades. The Pelican is cheaper, only in the $30s, but it is very poor in its introductory material and mediocre in notes, It is best to purchase wisely, which in this case means foregoing cheapness for once.<br /><br />COMPARISON TO OTHER EDITIONS<br /><br />Here in the States we're lucky to have so many great editions. The English have only one- Bate's RSC, which is a splendid edition- but we can choose from myriad editions: Pelican, Riverside, Norton, Arden, Bevington, etc. America has outdone its Mother Country in doing justice to the national poet (get to work, Brits!). Now Bevington's book is and has always been third in the official hierarchy of sacred Complete Shakespeares. The Riverside and Norton have been dominating the market since 1997. Both will be publishing new editions sometime this coming year (my professor and advisor has told me personally that she is writing introductions to several comedies for the upcoming Riverside, which will come out in 2014), and I have no doubt, unless something goes terribly wrong, that this new Riverside will be the finest collection of the complete works yet published. The upcoming Norton will be up there. Right now, all in all, bookmaking taken into account, I would say the Riverside is the single greatest edition ever created: its paper is thick, its construction sturdy, its font elegantly archaic but not difficult. In majesty it is like the folio. Its footnotes are a bit poorer than Bevington's, though, and it has A Funeral Elegy, which everyone agrees was an egregious mistake. But error is human.<br /><br />FOOTNOTES AND COMPARISON TO OTHER EDITIONS' NOTES<br /><br />For now the Bevington is really so fine and well-made that it's astounding it's not more popular. Its footnotes (I mean the latest edition now, which is also the most recent great edition of the complete works in existence) are without a doubt the best out of any complete works except the RSC. Footnotes have been added to every new Bevington edition, so what you're getting is a nearly perfectly footnoted work now, with very practical and intelligent remarks about the often confusing Elizabethan phraseology. It's nicely footnoted too, with a line number next to each line that has a footnoted word, and the footnotes are listed on the bottom of the page for convenience. Shakespeare's extraordinary intellect worked on a level far beyond that of most waking people, and that makes him inaccessible to a lot of individuals, so good footnotes are absolutely necessary for any reader of his works. These are my specific ratings as far as footnotes are concerned: Individual Folger and Arden editions 10/10, RSC 9.7/10, Bevington 9.5/10, Norton 9.3/10, Riverside 9/10, Pelican 8/10. The Complete Arden and the Complete Oxford, which the Norton is based on, have no footnotes. The people who buy them are seasoned readers of Shakespeare, and their value is academic and textual, not edifying to undergraduate students and non-experts.<br /><br />CLARITY OF INTRODUCTIONS<br /><br />The Bevington's introductory essay is magnificent and useful. It covers hundreds of years of Shakespeare scholarship and talks about his age, like the Norton and Riverside intros. Its style is far more accessible to the average reader than the Norton's, which is a little pretentious for my taste. The Norton has the better general information, and Jonathan Bate's introduction for the RSC is superb, but they're really not as interesting and Norton is kind of boring and pedantic. The Riverside has the finest essays on historical criticism, which the Norton kind of skips over, but overall the Bevington has the most up-to-date information and it's never useless. Introductions in the Bevington are brilliant too. I love that the Bevington is the most traditional of all. Its introductions aren't spoiled by the excesses and deficiencies of modern scholarship. In short, they're human and enlightening. Where the Norton tends to be too academic, the Bevington is clear-headed and direct. And it doesn't obsess over textual sources like the Riverside. The Riverside introductions are beautiful too (Frank Kermode, one of the greatest Shakespeare scholars of the century, wrote many of them), but the Bevington ones are incisive in a different way. Bevington is a brilliant scholar with a kind of commoner's sense for simplicity and clear-headedness, and his style is easy to follow. Again, not pretentious. Almost perfect. Let's be honest: how many people have been turned-off by Shakespeare because of the imposing, dry introductions? Too many for comfort. Shakespeare himself made fun of everything and everyone, including his own work; he was a man of inexhaustible comic energy, an ever-satirical joker. And what we often get in editions of his works is the most humorless, tedious, uninspired academic jargon that's harder to decipher than the plays themselves. Thank Jove Bevington can't be accused of that. The Norton people can and that's the new-historical outlook filtering through the essays. The tedium...<br /><br />TEXTUAL VALUE<br /><br />Unlike the Riverside, this edition doesn't put textual variations in brackets. I mean that in the Riverside, where there are two or three readings of a word, the word itself is put in brackets, so you read \\"the pangs of [despised] love\\" because some editors choose disprized instead of despised because no one knows what the original word was. This is irrelevant so long as you're not a scholar or grad student doing serious work on Shakespearian textual criticism. Bevington's texts are obviously solid and reasonable (he edited the Bantam Classics Shakespeares for a long time, for Modern Library). And that makes sense. He's one of the greatest living Shakesperians, along with Stephen Greenblatt. When it comes to pure textual focus, the Riverside wins the race hands-down; but when it comes to not having to beat yourself up over deciding if Hamlet means solid or sullied, going with Bevington's sullied will be a good enough bet. All textual variations are listed at the back. Tread lightly: the business of textual criticism is a tough one. Trust the text, but if you remember a line differently from a different edition, check out the variations too. Shakespeare, like the Bible, is infinitely malleable. He didn't want himself to be set in stone. His handwriting was doubtless messy (his huge mind worked ridiculously fast and his hand understandably had trouble keeping up. When he couldn't decide on a word, he made one up), and I doubt he cared much what words were made out of his gooey ink-marks here and there. I can imagine an actor asking him, \\"Hey Will, is this 'aslant a brook' or 'askaunt a brook' here?\\" And him saying in response, \\"Words, words, words,\\" with a smile (who cares, man?).<br /><br />AESTHETICS<br /><br />It has great pictures of productions leading up to 2012, a magnificent cover with the Chandos portrait on it, and clear, relatively large font, making this a choice text for the elderly and those whose vision isn't tiptop. The script is nice and legible and the text is in double columns. Textual notes are in the back, so there's no distraction between plays. The sonnets and poems are in the back also. The plays are printed by kind: Comedies, Histories, Tragedies, Romances, and in just about the order most scholars think they were written, so you have the first to last comedies, then first to last histories, first to last tragedies, finally romances, then the poems. This is a great way to do it; Norton prints the whole plays chronologically but Riverside takes after Bevington in doing them chronologically within genre.<br /><br />BOOKMAKING<br /><br />It is a large book, nearly a foot in length, but its spine is thin and won't bend even with a lot of use. The paper is very thin, but with care it will not perish. A lot of the time even new books will come with some bent or wrinkled pages, a fault that must be overlooked and understood as an inevitable consequence of Longman's effort to save money by printing on cheap, thin paper. Bookmaking is a dying art in general, and this edition is no exception. The fourth edition from '92 had much better paper and was thicker, this one being a fraction of its size with much thinner paper. The length and width ratio is very good though. On an upside, the paper for this edition isn't really thinner than the Norton paper. It's about the same. And with care, the book will last decades because it has sewn binding and there's not much stress on it when it's laid open. The cover and back are shiny and get scratched easily (scratches show), which is a slight design flaw that might annoy some people, and the book has no dust jacket. But that's a miniscule complaint, and those without OCD will find little to it.<br /><br />FINISHING THOUGHTS<br /><br />So overall, I'd get this seventh edition while I can. It's a treasure, no less. It makes studying Shakespeare such an indescribable joy. I recommend it to everyone and would buy it for friends, family or loved ones as a gift. If I were a professor (which I hope to be one ), this is the edition I'd assign my students, though I'd give them the liberty of the Norton, RSC and Riverside too. It would one of the very finest of choices and greatest of gifts.r-headedness, and his style is easy to follow. Again, not pretentious. Almost perfect.

B005OLF6BI|5.0|I'm 56 years old,and I am male.  I grew up in both Nashville Tennessee and the Oakland A's side of the bay in California. I've seen early Elton, George Harrison, the Beatles, The Who, the Stones, Skynard, Tillis, Haggard, and many many others in concert.  I've worked at the Opryhouse in 1983 and saw and met many like Randy Owen of Alabama, Hank Jr., Kristofferson, Cash, and so many others.  Saw them from the \\"greenroom\\" of the Opryhouse for the Nashville Network opening in 83 and the 83 awards show.  There is a line in a song by Tom T. Hall where he says among the things he loves, one is \\"music when it's good\\"...<br />Last night I got the World Tour Live DVD/CD combo and watched the DVD.  With all I've seen and studied regarding music, songwriters, singers, personalities, entertaining values (stage presence), and song quality in regards to \\"is this song relatable to real life?\\", I have to say that Taylor Swift is the most talented artist I have ever witnessed.  I was simply amazed, blown away, made happy, made to feel guilty, made to think that by the audience reactions, that there is hope for the younger generation...simply put, she is the best I have ever seen.  All the others were great, no doubt. Only concert that was weird was The Who at the Cow Palace where their drummer kept passing out only to be replaced by an audience member, yet with original Skynard on the stage menu with them, it was a classic.  Swift has an impeccable song writting talent.  Her singing is wonderful and when combined with her bodily expressions when the song needs it (almost as if her very facial contortions are choreographed), and just her audience connection, she is the best ever.  I like the way Owen connected with the audience, as well as Barry Gibb, but Swift is great. Missed out on Cleveland tickets for my daughter. Could have done it days before the actual sale.  Yep...my boo boo of the decade.  But the DVD with this nice big HD TV...ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  AMAZING!!!
B0040JHLKY|5.0|Perfect fit, great quality and excellent performance. This is my second pair of Brooks Adrenaline GTS line. I have flat feet and these are great for my pronation without having to wear orthotics. I got the black ones and I catch other runners checking them out all the time. :-)

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am enjoying this season more than ever!  The drama never stops and keeps me looking forward to the next episode!<br />Love all the characters and interactions with the help and the Lords and Ladies!
B00335EQ0E|5.0|I was a kid in the early 70's so I did not get a chance to see this until I was like 12 or 13 which was too bad because by that age I was too cool to like cartoons even cartoons that were completely cool. I did have this in VHS for my kids and they enjoyed it but it wasn't until I became a grandma that I was able to see what a great movie this is. My grandson loves it. I now have the DVD. He wants to watch it all the time and so does my youngest daughter. I am so pleased that they enyoy this movie and I now am not too cool to love it. And I do love it just like the rest of my kids. A great cartoon for anyone.
0345803485|4.0|I loved this series. They are all really good books. I couldn't put this book down. I had it done within a few hours.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book is a little bit different than the rest of his books. It was good; however, you know what's going to happen throughout most of the book.
0399213015|3.0|I knew a miniature edition would be smaller than a standard picture book, but I wasn't expecting it to be as tiny as it was/is.<br /><br />This product is smaller than my phone (Samsung Gallaxy 2) or could be compared to the size of a man's wallet.<br />To me this is too small to trully appreciate the wonderful art and story of the book. It is difficult to read to myself at this size, imagine trying to share it with kids.<br /><br />Doesn't meet my needs or exceptions.<br />So be warned, miniature edition really does mean MINIATURE, almost miniscule edition.
0439023491|4.0|This is a great book! I could not put it down! I had the whole book done within a day.
B0086700CM|5.0|download this. I am so picky about my games but I love this one. its so addicting and sooo much fun to play
B0018QQQK8|2.0|I couldn't really get into this book. I tried. It seemed like it took me forever to read. I'm hoping the movie will be so much better. The book just seemed to be very boring and dragged on and on. I like Nicholas Sparks. And even though I typically know with his books it's always the same story, I still like reading his books. This is the very first that I just couldn't get straight into.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My 3 year old son and I both love watching this DVD.  The images are colorful and the music is lovely.
0545425115|5.0|This is an awesome book! It is a different kind of story. It is very well written. Any age group could read this story. I have read the whole trilogy, and this book is my favorite.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|Just hilarious. Actually better than we expected it to be. And I agree with the other reviewer that Paul Rudd's scene in front of the mirror with himself is some of the funniest stuff I have even seen. Worth it for that alone.
0439023513|4.0|Good book. Not quite the ending I was hoping for, but it is still just as good of a story.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|One of my friend said that visiting India is like going to an Opera. You feel all the emotions. Funny and touching family firendly movie that you can watch with your high school or older children.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book! This is definitely a must read! I would definitely recommend reading Nicholas Sparks Dear John!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Wonderful book! The Scarpetta series never cease to amaze me, and I'm always hooked! I lack a few more books from the series until my Scarpetta collection is complete. Patricia, you rock!!
0345803507|3.0|This is a really good book. This book has more of a story line to it than the other two books in the series.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I bought this to find out what everyone was talking about. I found the &#34;action&#34; got quite boring after a while. I began to skip the &#34;sexy&#34; bits !<br />I must admit I bought the other two books just to find out whether she changed him in the end !<br />This book was not for my age group which is &#34;pensioner&#34; age.<br /><br />I am not sure who I would recommend it to unless it was as I did just to see what the fuss is about !
0345803493|4.0|This is a really good book. I read the entire five hundread and something page book within one entire day.
B000BGH22W|5.0|Love it love it love it!  This is a wonderful soundtrack and I love listening to it.  It is in great condition and a wonderful addition to my collection!
0446693804|3.0|This is a good book of Nicholas Sparks. I do actually like the movie slightly better than the book though.
B000IMM3XW|4.0|I like this movie. It moves a bit slowly in the beginning, but it's a fun romp in the X-men universe.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Heard so much about this series that I took advantage of the free weekend of Showtime to watch a couple of episodes. I was hooked and purchased Season 1 from Amazon. The series is full of suspense and drama, and very intense. Good entertainment, but definitely MA-rated with lots of sexually-explicit scenes and strong language, somewhat taken to an extreme (thus four stars).
B001IAME78|5.0|It's probably not the best of the Marvel cinematic universe, but there's something inherently fun about the Hulk smashing the hell out of stuff. I enjoy it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was my first Lee Child book.  It was intriguing, a little bloodier than I normally like but the story was good.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|Definitely a great movie. A great sequel to Iron Man and a great piece of the Marvel movie universe puzzle.
0375413405|5.0|I love cook books and this one is from one of my favorite Chefs, Julia Child!!  Easy to understand.  Pictures are beautiful!  Shipped on time.  Have enjoyed ordering through Amazon.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This movie was a lot more fun than I thought it would be. I was excited for it to be released into theaters and it did not disappoint in its fun.
B00846TRHY|1.0|No worth the time, money, or effort. Don't waste your money. Even my dog disliked it, good thing he could not heist his leg that high.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I still can't believe how good this version of Thor is. The cheesiness of Thor is somehow transformed into a really entertaining story.
