B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is very fun. They give lots of aura (the game currency) u can progress quickly without have to spend real money... unlike most building games out there.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|The 2+hours fly by and the character development reels you in as you root for the underdog and smite the scheming, heartless insurance company. LOVE IT.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day does it again. She shares a great story with us and leaves us wanting more. I can't wait for the next two Crossfire novels. I do hope that Eva & Gideon get their happy ending :)
B0063M22QO|4.0|Really good it holds my interest for hours.  I have insomnia and this is wonderful way to relax my brain. Sometimes it does confuse me with the flower tiles because of the similarity in the pattern.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Confused when I saw the 1 and 2 star reviews. Sylvia's writing is still amazing, the story was well written and we delved deeper into Gideon and &#34;angels&#34; back story. I also enjoyed the side stories .. Migumi, Carey and Brett. My only issue; paying $10 for an Ebook!!!! And, waiting another year for the next story to be written. However, I don't feel those issues warrant 1 or 2 stars.<br />Well done Sylvia.. Keep doing your thing :)
B0013V2UU8|4.0|Great addition to legos. My kids loves to build temples and funky roofs with these , I think they are his favorite lego parts right now.
B008Y73940|5.0|Good entertainment and plot development. I like movies that are a little more cerebral without violence and this one fit that description.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|WELL DESIGNED, LIGHT WEIGHT AND EASY TO USE. I LIKE THIS PRODUCT DUE TO IT'S SIZE AND FUNCTION. I KEEP IT ON MY PERSON WHEN I FISH OR HUNT! BUY ONE!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Having read all three, this book to me was basically a segway to book 3. Because of the actual plot of this book, it sometime felt like some of the story line was just regurgitated from the Hunger Games (I wouldn't tell you why for spoiler reasons).<br /><br />I loved this trilogy as a whole and while this was my least favorite of the three, it was a necessary step to the finale. All the books were quick easy reads and kept your interest going.<br /><br />If you liked the Hunger Games and want to continue the story, I recommend this book, and after reading this you will no have no choice but to read Mockingjay! (Great business tactic Suzanne!).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book all the way through....the end though wasn't what I expected...it made me cry as if I myself lost Christian grey..
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a book I couldn't put down. While I still really enjoyed the 2nd book, the third is where things really got interesting. It was a quick and very enjoyable read. Highly recommend!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very fun and playful. You have many chances to get extra things and much more. Subway surfers is the best!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I highly enjoyed the whole trilogy of books. This book was a very enjoyable and a quick read, and I hardly put it down. While I originally thought it was geared to teens, I certainly didn't feel like I was reading a teen book while reading this.
159562015X|5.0|I like focusing on the positive and I am going to use this at work, with my management staff, so we better understand each other and our strengths.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Love  the book! Took me a while to get to th  point of not being able to put it down! After that it only took me 3days to read the trilogy!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book - it was released on my birthday, so I thought it was going to be a great b-day present.  What a total waste of time and money.  In fact, I just returned it.  Eva is beyond annoying,  I hate her mother.  Carey was OK, but now, not at all.  I found myself skipping most of the sex scenes.  I mean, seriously, who has that much time or energy???  And then there is no ending, but two more books???  It is amazing to me that Ms. Day chose to ruin such a great premise.  So disappointed.....
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great story that keeps getting better and better. Mystery, intrigued, sex, romance all in one book. I can't wait for the next.
0385349947|5.0|This is an excellent book for any woman in any career including domestic engineer.  We all need to support and respect each other in the choices that we have made, and learn how to overcome the barriers to achieving desired levels of leadership.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it!!!  Good graphics, lots of fun.  Have it on my phone and decided to add to my kindle too for a bigger screen for playing
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I waited months for the third book in the trilogy only to discover now there are going to be five books in the series, what?  The first two were terrific and so I looked forward to the third. That was obviously a mistake.  The book bordered on boring, c'mon Sylvia I know you can do better than this.  I'm all done with Gideon and Eva, I really don't care what happens in books 4 and 5, I'm moving on.
B00992CF6W|2.0|This game gets boring especally if your a kid because pretty much every one in your school will talk about it and it gets lame I would reccomend terraria even though its 2d it has more stuff and has harder bosses and a underworld
B003G4W49C|5.0|I finally read this classic, after having it on my short list to read for years. It lives up to the hype, and the ending is amazing. I hope the movie does it justice, but I doubt it.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|At first, this academic exercise is interesting. Rather than care anything about the story (or lack thereof), I was intrigued by Brooks's process in converting recent geopolitical history into vignettes with zombie backdrops. But there are only rare moments of tension, zero character arcs, insultingly unsubtle themes, no narrative trajectory to speak of...what story elements exist are shorter than the average sitcom. The one interesting story of a Chinese nuclear sub that has escaped the mainland with its crew and their families is somewhere in the middle of this tedious slog and over too quickly. I was able to appreciate what Brooks accomplished here until I'd finished about 80% of the text when I realized I was putting out way too much effort to give a damn. Still, I hate to leave things unfinished, so I soldiered on to the weak, uneventful end. I'm baffled as to how this book spawned so many fanboys. Clearly, a great deal of effort went into researching the military and political props in World War Z...if only Brooks had researched how to write narrative, then he might have had something. Well, lets just hope endorsing all those royalty checks is eating up all the time he might have had to write another.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very satisfying ending, but I didn't know what it would be like until the end, and it was fun to read.
0812992792|5.0|This book is very creative...the story goes back and forth between dreams and reality.  You have to follow it carefully or you will miss the point.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I think the thing that bother me the most was that the story did not let me escape into the book. I felt that story was not as clean and smooth as the author's other books. It almost felt that there was a rush or a lost of interest in the editing process, because there is a a lot of fluffy passages and unnecessary wording. There was too much focus on creating new issues to carry the story along.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Summarizing the book Eva was stronger, the chemistry was HOT Hot hot, and Gideon was simply amazing.<br /><br />I have no respect for her mother, not sure if Magdalene can be friends with Gideon after their history, Jean-Francois is a total looser in my book (that guy needs to grow a pair ASAP), and Corinne portrays a totally different persona in this book, clingy, needy and full drama queen, while in previous books she was ice-cold and in total control,<br /><br />The things that I hate is that Eva has grown to trust Gideon implicitly and his feelings for her, but still she opens doors with Brett that should be close & locked with forgotten keys.  She is extremely jealous of him, but still provokes him letting Brett get close to her, talk about hypocrite.  She would never allow that from Gideon.<br /><br />What I loved:  GIDEON.  He is too good to be true.  A bit possessive (but we all knew that from previous books), how he opens up to her, how he learn to communicate with Eva, how she is always No.1 in everything, how he is willing to change just to make her happy.  MY GOD, he is a darker Darcy!<br /><br />I can only wait to see what comes next.  I do want to know the twist set-up in this book, with Elizabeth, Graves, I want a harsh ending with Corinne and her dramas and even harsher and kind of humiliating for Deanna, I want to know what is on Eva's mother mind (poor Stanton), I want for Tatiana's ploy to back-fire in her face (Yeah I think it's all BS), but most importantly I want Gideon to be 28, happy and as free of daemons as possible and hopefully a little less drugged.<br />----<br />I'm impressed with all the reviews out there hating that the series will be continuing, but as I was in the 70% mark I was sure there was NO WAY that all lose ends could be covered.  That being said, I'm not happy we haven't reach the HEA yet but I'm thrilled that I could get to read more Gideon.  I'm not sure if the series can stretch to 5 books though.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I've loved these books and they keep getting better and better !  Entwined with You has definitely gone above my expectation.  Great twists and turns, romance, mystery.  It's great. As i was approaching the end, I was feeling so sad for it to all end... and then you've given us all a great surprise !  I for one can't wait for the next book.  I hope there will be a few more !  Crossfire Novels are the best !
B00BEXB18M|1.0|She will enjoy these mid tempo rock tunes. Makes Risk look like a Slayer album. As someone else has stated just lazy, uninspired writing and execution. I'm not one of those people that expect Rust in Peace 2 or the like but I would just like something that resembles Megadeth. Generic rock bands are a dime a dozen. It would be nice for Megadeth to be Megadeth. Wasting Brodericks talent is an understatement. The one and only highlight is the end of Dance in the Rain which is actually the best song on the album but that isn't saying much. Hate to make the Metallica comparison but this is in the same ballpark as Load through St Anger which they maybe play 1 or 2 song tops from those because they were huge missteps and no one wants to hear those. Same applies to this, Risk, and should apply to Thirteen. Having release Endgame which rips not really that long ago makes it all the more disappointing. I have tried to like this but just can't. I love Megadeth but I'll be sticking to their 11 good to great albums when I need a fix. If they do happen to put out any more albums I hope they got whatever this is out of their system and release something great. Not recommended at all.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great for backup when you are on the go . Love case as well better than putting it in your Pocket  by it self .
B004YF6MHW|5.0|Some people seem to think that Amazon is who has to update the apps here. I don't think that's correct. But either way, this is a brilliant product with great support,  and add on products as well.<br /><br />To the developer... Please update this version.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I like the case design and size and the dial design and colors.  Easy to read the time.  Very practical for everyday use. Price from Amazon is very reasonable.  Accurate automatic movement gains about 5 seconds a day.  No batteries to fail.
B00873GRU4|3.0|So many people raved about this trilogy.. huh... no idea why<br /><br />Original idea that’s why it gets 3 stars<br /><br />Minimalist characterisation and i never really felt for any of them. It just seemed a little ‘unreal’ - like people don’t act like that. To me, i just think people would ask more questions, be more independent. And all the characters seemed emotionally stunted.<br /><br />Not big on humour either, which doesn’t help.<br /><br />& yeah maybe he’s going to reveal how they got to be in Silo’s like that... but you know what, i don’t care. I certainly won’t be buying or reading them. It’s too far fetched, downright weird and depressing.<br /><br />Most indie publishing i’ve read on Kindle this year is easily better than this.<br /><br />Not worth it for me.
B006CHML4I|5.0|Very practical watch for everyday wear.  Reasonably priced at Amazon.  Just-right size and easy to read time.  Automatic movement is accurate--gains a few seconds each day.  No batteries to go dead at the wrong time.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|this game makes you think and do it quickly I think it is a great learning tool for my children
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a really good book and  I recommend this  book for the people looking for romance in their lives. I gave it 5 star  because the book expresses emotion,thoughts of the characters ,and details about  everything. This  is a really good book and if you haven't read it yet you  missing out on all the romance you can learn from this book.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|though he may not completely understand it my 4 year old loves to play this game!! it keeps him busy
B000HL0EEE|4.0|Enjoyed the series a lot. One of the best of the Start Trek series in my view.<br />I didn't get to watch it much when it was on television. It got pre-empted a lot<br />in my area, and I was working a lot when it was on.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|This has always been my favorite movie but listening to the book was an extraordinary experience!!  I Loved everything about it but especially when she directly writes to the reader!  I am so happy right now!  Thank you Charlotte Bronte!!!
B0090EJR1K|4.0|If you enjoy earthy humor, this is one funny flick...Irreverant but well written and exceedingly well produced...It is a dumb story of a dictator and his path to righteousness...Well, kinda becomes a good guy...Laughs throughout the entire film...I'm talking out loud chuckles and guffaws...BUT...and this is important...You must have an open mind about reasonably raunchy humor...If not, don't waste your time...I'm glad I didn't...I enjoyed every frame of \\"The Dictator\\"...
B003M70O5O|4.0|This series depicts the MC life and involves a lot of sex and violence. I would not recommend that you allow your children to view this series. The thing I like about this is that the club stays together threw adversity. I am a man of faith and I am truly thankful that this is not my life style. Defiantly will take you our of your comfort zone.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Seriously this book was awesome! I've read tons of books that are very similar, however this writer changed the game completely. I normally am not a fan of the mans side of the story, but this Drew Evans was so funny at times I had tears in my eyes. He was brutally honest, arrogant, and down right infuriating at times. He's also funny, open, and somewhat of a romantic. I would defiantly recommend this book to a friend. Read it!! It's... It's... Well let me just say I've written the writers name down, cause holy moly she's a great one!! Check it out for yourself...
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This is a no brainer.  Do you like this CD/album/record?  I've had this record on 8-track, record, cassette, and now CD.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|most of the reviews were right about how disappointing this book turned out to be. this is supposed to be a trilogy. there's too many side stories that are unnecessary and people that have nothing to do with gideon and eva's ongoing love/life story. i hated the way eva's feeling towards brett and leading him on when she just married gideon and told him how much she loves him? just like the other disappointed people that waited for this book, i agree that sylvia day and the publisher got a little greedy and decided to prolong this suppossedly trilogy into five books......
B0097HSS4M|4.0|The app is great, I don't like editing my photos too much but I love that it gives you the option to add filters to your photos. You can whiten areas if need be, blur out blemishes, sharpen or even blur your images. I highly recommend this app to anyone that has been searching for a photo editing app.
B009MO5G90|3.0|Just as the heading says, it keeps getting worse. Maybe it's time they stopped making a sequel though the way it ended, it's been setup for yet another RE. Sigh... maybe they should get JJ Abrams to make the next (and final?) sequel!!
0385120508|5.0|I'm still reading this wonderful story and taking my time for it will end before I know it!  One of my top picks.....
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE LOVED IT. LOVED THE FACT THAT I BOUGHT IT FOR ONE PRICE AND THE PRICE WENT DOWN WITHOUT MY KNOWING IT AND AMAZON LET ME KNOW THAT THEY CHARGED ME THE LOWER PRICE. HOW COOL IS THAT? I WILL DEFINATELY ORDER MORE THINGS FROM THIS SITE.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Not just a book for intimate relationships! The lessons can be applied to all relationships including family, friends and work colleagues. I now have a greater understanding of both how I show love and how others show their love for me.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|The story of Rodriquez is amazing.  What this man endured and still be able to have a positive attitude is amazing.  His story and that of his daughters just makes you want to know more.  I am so happy that he is finally getting recognized in this country.
B002ZTIIXK|4.0|This is a beautiful collection of songs and a quality recording.  K.D.'s voice takes your breath away.  CD 5 out of 5 - took 1 star off for the crappy cardboard case it came in, hate sliding my precious discs in and out of cardboard cases and risking scratches.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|After seeing the story of Rodriquez, I had to get his CDs and I've been playing them almost non stop for weeks.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|bit slow to start but a very different view on a love story loved the polar opposite main characters Great
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Every song on this CD is great.  How this never sold in the US before is a travesty. You won't be disappointed.
B007QSNMS6|4.0|Truly insightful. Loved the chatty format that made it a great read too. A must read for all in the business of value creation, of any kind !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game. It is really a challenge. A fun challenge. I love Miami. Thank you for making the Miami version.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|My kids love this game. My kids play all the time. Even my 5 year old is better than me at this but it's cool.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|If you wanna get the precision and control achieved by PC keyboard and Mouse and if you are a PC Gamer who use PS3 as the secondary console, go for this.<br /><br />After some calibration you can feel the difference... but make sure you check the compatibility of your keyboard and mouse before purchasing this.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have used this product, without incidence, for fiftenn years. Works great with all lines of Intel chip/chipset(s). Never had a chip 'fry' either with air or water cooling. I would suggest using this product to anyone.everyone.
B001AW156U|5.0|I do not know why PS3 controller is not build like this.<br /><br />This is a great accessory. You will feel more relaxed when using R 2 / L 2<br /><br />Go for it !
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game m e but I know the new update came out but on my kindle fire there is no update available WTF
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game subway surfers is one of the best games in years. This reason why I rated this tame with five stars was because this game is just so exciting and you can never get bored . So I hope this review was Wourth it bye<br /> bye.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Play this game 5 stars up. I always go on this app.subway surf<br />Subway surf.rate all the star this is very fun playing<br />SubwAy surf
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|the fallen tree gang have done it again!  it was worth the wait and its just great!  it was a little too easy at first but the games got tougher.  kudos to the team!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it! Ready for the next book. Great read couldn't put it down. A must-have for all. On to the next.
B0063GORYU|5.0|its compelling and fun makes you want to keep playing I'm stuck in a wheelchair with not much to do so this is very time consuming
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is an amazing writer. I can't stop reading it's always \\"just one more chapter\\".  A must read for everyone.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I'm not a huge action movie fan, but this is a movie my husband and I have both seen a million times and still love it. Nice to see it without commercials or edited down for TV, finally bought the DVD...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I don't know where to begin....I knew that the military all forms of keep us safe and keep us with our freedoms but I never knew in depth about missions until I read this book and I saw the movie Zero Dark Thirty.  What they go thru on various missions since 9/11 that we don't know much about don't realize they are always ready, always training to be ready in a moments notice, lose time with their own families and friends and that their own families don't know b/c it is top secret.  This book high lights some of what it is like to be a seal in the navy as he starts own telling you about some missions since he started and how things changed and especially after the first mission to find Osama didn't pan out and I couldn't put this book down I just kept wanting to know more and more and now I want to read more about different aspects of what these guys go thru! Then he gave the proceeds to seals that were hurt-CHARITY a good one and he names a few that are worthy of donations then the book ends with names of some who lost there lives protecting the USA and all of us! If I could I would have rated it 100**** and I suggest you all read it asap and really think about what we all take for granted! We owe all of these guys a lot!!! 5* only b/c that is as high as the scale is!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|More from the upstairs and downstairs of Downtown Abbey.  We follow the families through the post war years and the struggles of women to come out from behind men's trousers.  We also see the challenging of the noble class by the middle and lower classes as the world is changing.  The juxtaposition of the men against women and the juxtaposition between classes highlight the long way we have come after 80 years.  Our generation really takes our blessings for granted.  Maggie Smith shines as the Dowager Countess and has the best lines.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  It is very addictive and entertaining.  I find it very hard to put it down.<br />.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I only use this app for basic use on my kindle fire hd. It works great for what I need it for. There are no problems like error or anything. So good enough
B000089RV6|5.0|OF COURSE YOU ALL KNOW HOW GOOD THIS ALBUM REALLY IS! MY 13 YEAR OLD SON ONE DAY SAID, &#34;MOM..LISTEN TO THIS SONG YOU MIGHT LIKE IT, I THINK IT WAS MADE IN THE DINOSAUR AGES.&#34; OF COURSE HE'S INTO ANY AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH &#34;CALL OF DUTY&#34; GAMES, ETC. AND YES, IT ROCKED. MY SON PLAYED THE NEW SONG DISPLAYED FOR &#34;CALL OF DUTY&#34;, IT WAS &#34;BACK IN BLACK.&#34; I DECIDED TO BUY THE ALBUM AGAIN, THIS TIME NOT IN VINYL ;)
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is fun except it needs to update faster but each time it does it gets more and more like minecraft pc version .
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|An all around great movie: visually stunning, well acted, and very interesting. I did find it a little slow and in my opinion they could have cut out like 10-15 minutes. Still worth the watch.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I went into this book dying to know whether the issues that seemed kind of skimmed over in \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" would finally find solutions in this book. Instead I was confronted with something of a love... rectangle?<br /><br />I knew with the events that happened in the end of \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" that Lena would be a bit scattered and mournful. I never thought it would manifest in the form of a tall, dark, and handsome stranger that seemed to be stealing her affections away from Ethan. There are so many ways Ethan could have confronted the situation rather than how he did. I was disappointed that Ethan didn't show more spin. When someone threatens to come between two people in love, obviously one of them would fight to keep the relationship intact, right? I didn't feel Ethan did much of that. Yes, he chased Lena as she continued to try to run away, but he did not actually confront her or try to reason with her. Instead he started to give up and look elsewhere same as her. That was by far the most frustrating part of the story. The fact that the two people who are fought so hard in the first book seemed to give up on the relationship they had finally gotten (moderately) approved.<br /><br />The romance aspect was the only part of the book that I struggled with. I found the mysteries of the Caster world developing more and more intriguing qualities. The Tunnels, that were mentioned and explored only briefly in \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" is now one of the main focal points of this book. It was fascinating to explore the Tunnels along with Ethan and his, according to him, \\"motley crew\\" as they searched to save Lena from tall, dark, and yummy and virtually herself.<br /><br />Throughout the book more and more revelations are made to show that even without Lena's intervention in Ethan's life he was always firmly embedded in the Caster world. If he hadn't fallen for a Caster girl he would have still possibly discovered the society while attempting to understand his mother's death. Lena has constantly chastised herself for involving Ethan in the Caster world but perhaps in later books she will stop doing so.<br /><br />Lena is a character I struggle with on a book-by-book basis. In \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" I understood her self-deprecating ways a bit more due to the bullying of the entire town and a mother that discarded her until she needed her for her own selfish gain. The Lena of \\"Beautiful Darkness\\" I did not understand as easily. Yes, I understood she was devastated by events in \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" and that she is constantly struggling with whether she is good or bad, Light or Dark, but how that turned into a tryst with a stranger and despicable deeds she does throughout to both Ethan and the townspeople of Gatlin... I don't 100% understand that. Grief can do things to a person, true, but to the extent that Lena was willing to give up the one person who has never faltered in their faith in her? What are you doing Lena? If you continue to be deputy downer all the time, you are going to ruin the series for me. First book, mild annoyance. Second book, starting to get worse. If the third book includes much of the same, I may have to step away from the Caster Chronicles for a while.<br /><br />Don't take my harsh words to mean that I hated the book. As I said, the aspects that didn't involve the romance, were amazingly written and very Alice in Wonderland-like (which I LOVE by the way). That part of the book made up for all the woe-is-me's from Lena and the I-love-her-but-give-up's from Ethan. Would I say this was as good as \\"Beautiful Creatures\\"? No. Worse? Not by much.<br /><br />Review Posted on: http://www.ladybugliterature.blogspot.com's death.

B006LSZECO|5.0|At first I wasn't sure if I'd like Gone Girl, as it seemed to start a bit slow for my tastes. But wow, it completely sucked me in. At first you don't know who to root for, then everything is turned upside down and you think it can't get anymore twisted than it is.... but you're so wrong, cause the twists just keep coming.<br /><br />Can't wait to read more from Gillian Flynn!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Because of the negative reviews I keep reading I was a little nervous to read this book.  Even though I've been waiting for months for it, and love the other 2, I still was worried that I wouldn't love it as much as the others.  But I have to tell you if you love Gideon & Eva and their story as much as I do, just it a chance no matter what you read.  You wont be disappointed.
B00CTXBO9M|1.0|I love Doodle Jump, but I don't like what the game makes Kindle Fire users do. The only way to unlock the themes and extra features for Kindle Fire users is by buying this. I'm sick of Amazon letting in apps that aren't meant for the Fire. The free version works for everyone else. Why can't we use it too? Amazon, please stop.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This has been a movie I have been waiting to buy for  a while. Great story and like Edward Norton.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Is pretty much the same cable you recieve when you first buy any type of Kindle, so there is no complain about it.
B002I9Z8B2|3.0|First off I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I really enjoy this film.  It is a classic revenge tale of cat and mouse set in space with hints of Moby Dick.  The special effects still hold up and are top notch, but what really steals the show is the film's antagonist Khan.  He is devious and every bit a match for Admiral Kirk.  The only thing keeping me from giving this Blu-ray a better rating is that it's not the Extended Directors Cut.  I'll be hanging onto my DVD of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Extended Directors Cut a bit longer until Paramont gets their act together and releases that cut on Blu-ray.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I love Heartthrob, Tegan and Sara are on the next level with this album. I think every Tegan and Sara fan with love and respect Heartthrob as the mix of the old Tegan and Sara lyrics with the new mix of more poppy synth instrumentals. A definite must to every Tegan and Sara fan. This is the album that is gonna reach out to more listeners.

B00BW5K5DO|2.0|Right as the game picks up and you feel like you have learned how to play it then begins to charge you. I mean I understand you need to make money, but the game isn't good enough to charge that much money for in my opinion. Expensive town farming game that is probably good for non violent flash gamers.

B00BC24NT4|4.0|Book opens with Oscar Wilder quotation, \\" If one tells the truth, one is sure, sooner or later, to be found out\\". By the end of this novel, I wondered if it is ever safe to tell the truth, because people with power and money can reinterpret and redesign the facts. Ethical truth tellers will suffer their personal agony when self-centered people cover up facts.<br /><br />Although listed as fiction with the usual disclaimer about coincidence if any item seems to represent a real situation or person, the book seems more like nonfiction. LeCarre creates credible personalities caught up in government, private, and mercenary defense work. Having just read Mazzetti's nonfiction \\"The Way of the Knife...\\" I thought I recognized some of LeCarre's characters, although in a British context.<br /><br />The ending leaves me sad, but hopeful that what comes in LeCarre's next book will resolve evil with truthtellers living at peace with themselves. I suppose that would be fiction.

B0014DFCMS|5.0|I already had this film on DVD and iTunes, but wanted a blueray too for my collection.  This one has lots of extras and interviews and is worth the purchase.  I love this film.

B005LZW8FO|4.0|I got this film because I'm a Brit Marling fan and own all of her films.  This one is an excellent story and won't dissappoint if you're a fan.  And the blueray played with no problem. I only mention this because I left review of her other film Sound of My Voice on blueray saying it did not play in the blueray version, not once but twice, but this one is fine and the movie is good.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I've been thinking what is the best way to review this book.  I'm upset about the two book extension, but I'm mostly upset about the price.  The books are about 300 pages which is not good value for the money.  If I were to buy this series as a whole book, I don't think I'd be willing to pay $50.00 for it.  With that being said, I did enjoy this last book.  The characters and writing were consistent.  they experienced growth.  I understand the charcuterie better.  In the first two books I felt the &#34;love&#34; between Gideon and Eva was codependency and lust rolled into one, not real love.  Now after the third book, the love feels real and it feels secure.  It is based on the support and acceptance of each other, and of course the amazing sex.  This book installment opened many issues, but resolved none.  I understand why so many people are upset about the ending.....because there wasn't one.  I have to come to a decision as to wether I want to spend another $20.00 to get the conclusion to the story.  As consumers the only thing we can control is who we give our money to.
B0083Z614S|3.0|I couldn't seem to get into this book but I think part of the problem was that I had seem too many of the movie adaption for ti so went in with certain expectations.

B0067R0APK|1.0|I paid up for platinum and made this my main weather app, and the update has ruined the functionality of the radar map display. First I come to a page with my primary location occupying less than a third of a phone display at a fixed zoom that cannot be adjusted. The rest of the page has one tiny square showing radar at a secondary location and 3 blanks, because I don't happening to be monitoring the weather in five different geological locations. Worse, if I &#34;select&#34; the main region by tapping it, it simply doesn't load. The template loads. There's a beautiful map key in multiple colors, along with a button that promises to zoom the data in or out, but the data itself never loads.  I want to see a FULL PAGE RADAR MAP OF MY LOCATION THAT WORKS.  IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

B005LAIHXQ|2.0|How can something with so much potential go so far off track as Prometheus? This is the question you'll be asking yourself if you watch this awful science fiction film from 2012. With stars like Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce in the crew and noted filmmaker Ridley Scott producing, you'd think this would be almost a sure-fire hit. You'd be wrong thinking that, for this is a turkey.<br /><br />The plot of Prometheus, what there is of one, is about a privately-funded space search to meet our makers. The ship and crew land successfully on the new planet which, of course, has breathable oxygen. They find remnants of a cizilization with DNA that matches human, which gives question to what God created in 7 days and 7 nights. Then comes the standard horror, some awful gory scenes of terror, an admission that the old civilization stocked the planet with WMDs, and an obligatory and completely predictable battle for the survival of the human race. In between, there are a few interesting or watchable scenes including one where a woman gives herself a C-section; but this film is, in the main, drivel.<br /><br />It did one thing well: it probably takes the cake as the most derivative big budget blockbuster in film history. I counted scenes in this movie borrowed from [[ASIN:B00498VS1E Alien]], the movie that put Scott on all filmgoers' radar, as well as [[ASIN:B000HF4U04 2010: The Year We Make Contact]], [[ASIN:0780628586 The Hidden]], [[ASIN:B00471Z3CI Poltergeist]], [[ASIN:B0002CHK1S The Thing]] 1981 version and [[ASIN:0792833244 Species]], without doubt making Prometheus the biggest copycat film I have ever seen. There are a few original scenes in it but little else the experienced sci-fi/horror fan hasn't seen done better elsewhere.<br /><br />Prometheus was the mythical god of fire who was sentenced by Zeus, for whom he disobeyed, to be chained to a rock where an eagle would come daily and eat his liver. This kept up until Prometheus was freed by Hercules. There's even some of this in this movie, with lots of guts on display. If it wasn't bad enough Prometheus borrowed from just about every other sci-fi and horror film made in recent years, did it have to ruin it for the mythological figure too?<br /><br />One final note: Charlize Theron, one of the most dependable and talented dramatic actresses in Hollywood, is wasted in this film with incredibly poor direction making her a whiny, downcast character with a Johnny one note dimension. I couldn't tell how well Pearce did because I couldn't figure out which character he played. Whatever it was, it wasn't enough to save this turkey. Unless you want some laughs, avoid this bomb.of this in this movie, with lots of guts on display.

B00992CF6W|5.0|As you all know, updates on Minecraft Pocket Edition have taken what seems like millenia to our standard priorities, and have led us to mislead Johan Bernhardsson, Director producer of the game Minecraft Pocket Edition. But because I don't want everyone to worry, I will tell you that these updates are different for kindle fire's settings and that it takes Johan a little bit to make sure our favorite game and it's updates can be enjoyed as much as possible without any hesitation to knowing you can trust the company of Mojang AB and its priorities for our favored love of this game and its future.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. Gameloft is the best app company I have seen in my entire life. I highly recommended this game.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I loved it! I really enjoy movies that make you think, like Inception. I was worried, at first, that this movie might not be what I wanted since it was labled \\"Director's Cut\\", I didn't know if that meant it was the movie only with commentary. However, it's better than I thought! The first disc is the movie, with OPTIONAL commentary, and then the second disc has bonus features that I have yet to fully check out, but I think it is exactly what I wanted and at a great price!
0062073567|5.0|Each of the items I ordered (except the Chanel No. 5) was a book or a record (CD, etc.) that I had owned in the past, but lost track of over the years. It's great to have them back.<br />I enjoyed the mysteries, all of which I had read many years ago, but I had forgotten the plots. I also enjoyed the one book I rememberd distinctly: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,&#34; even though it was the only book in the group to which I knew &#34;Who did it.&#34; This was the story that made Agatha Christie an internationally known celebrity.<br /><br />Even the perfume was special, as this used to be a Christmas tradition betwwen my wife and me, that I gave her a bottle of Chanel No. 5 each year. She appreciated it as always, but never had a chance to use it. She passed away rather shortly after Christmas.
B000FC130E|5.0|It's been a really long time since a book has intrigued me so much as to hold my attention for over a half hour at a time. This book did not only that, but genuinely shocked me multiple times (while a few things were very predictable, certainly not many) and inspired me to keep writing. This is my first Neil Gaiman book, and I was not let down.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Like many others I preordered this book and sat through two release dates that were delayed.  I read this book yesterday - (I read Kristen Ashley's new one first!)- and returned it today.  I resent reading a trilogy and finding out that the author has decided to milk it for all she can by \\"adding\\" two more books to the series.  Fix this Sylvia Day!  Tie up all the loose ends, give us our \\"happily ever after\\" and make it FREE.  No way will I EVER buy another book by her unless she makes this good.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Because otherwise, you are going to have to buy this. It's a great game, easily worth it. However, don't kick your self by waiting to pay. Easily as good as cut the rope, but way different. Why are you still reading this? Go get the game!!
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|To a certain extent, the material in here has been covered for the last few decades.<br /><br />For me it made think about the process a little differently and that is a VERY GOOD THING.  It also opened up the idea that each product or product group does not have to have the same business model.  There are some solid examples given of how to implement the Canvas idea.  It doesn't matter if you do this the old fashioned way with paper and pen or with the online tools.<br /><br />As business leaders we need to be open to ideas or new ways of looking at old ideas and go through the steps to see if a product or model will work.  This is a good way to get there.

B000002JSN|5.0|I'll make it simple for you.  If you were to buy only 1 Led Zeppelin album, this is the one to buy.  I have been a Led Zeppelin fan since before I was a teenager and PG is their best.  Excellent blend of hard rockers with bad ass guitar riffs and acoustic gems on a wonderfully arranged album.  The double album gave the band the luxury of throwing in some great songs that had been left \\"hanging around\\" from earlier recording sessions (e.g., Boogie with Stu).  Yet, somehow they all seem to fit together.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I purchased this mouse to use with a X I M  adapter for the PlayStation 3. it's strongest point in my opinion in addition to the price points is the crazy high DPI ability along with the option to modify sensitivity on-the-fly.cosmetically it is pleasing to the eye and has more than enough programmable buttons.<br /><br />Cons: it was a little difficult to access the cavity in which to place the accompanying weights if you like your mouse to be on the heavier side .not too much of a big deal in my opinion. I've owned Logitech gaming mice before and this mouse stacks up with others twice its price.

There wasn't even a glimmer of closer for anything, it felt like the characters didnt progress at all, everyone is in the same spot they where in the second book. I love this story and am so disappointed to have been lead on about it being a trilogy and even more annoyed about the authors note &#34; this isn't the end&#34; and no further e explanation....ahhhhhhh
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have previously purchased this headset, and like it because it is over the head, and not ear buds.  It's lightweight, comfortable, never effects my hair style,  it has a great sound,  it's flexible, and well built.  I worry about wires breaking inside, but it has never happened.
1451695195|5.0|this is about some thing I have believed from my early 20s-extensive reading and personal experiences in what I perceived as<br />a child as dreams. Which were very vivid and out of body experiences.As I got older that ability and gift diminished and finally ceased however I never lost the memories of them. What I love about this book is a highly trained and gifted Dr./scientist felt<br />compelled to write this book about his experience and miraculous and according to science impossible recovery despite the possible consequences to his professional standing.I believe he was given that gift for that reason and God bles him for following<br />his heart and absolute conviction that it was his duty to tell his story, despite any negative reaction among his peers.My thanks<br />and gratitude to Dr. Alexander

B002LC8HF0|5.0|[...]  Ah, epic fantasy. Arguably the most creative, expansive genre out there, one where you can immerse yourself in a unique world brimming with magic and adventure. One of my favourite fantasy writers (maybe even my top favourite!) at the moment is Brandon Sanderson, the mastermind behind the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\", as well as the YA novel \\"The Rithmatist\\" (see me gushing over it here!). I remember completely falling in love a few months ago with Vin and Elend and the rest of the characters of the series, not to mention the awesome world of Allomancy! Alas, all good things must come to an end--in this case--with \\"The Hero of Ages\\", the third and final book of my beloved \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\".    Humanity is doomed. One year has passed since Vin was tricked into freeing Ruin, the mystic force whose sole desire is to destroy the world, from the Well of Ascension. The ashes now fall more heavily, and the mists are killing more and more people. The world is ending, and it's up to Vin to correct her wrongs and help her husband Emperor Elend Venture, now a Mistborn himself, to find clues left behind by the lord Ruler that will allow them to save the people of the Final Empire. But the omniscient Ruin is bent on ending the world and manipulating Vin's every move, and saving humanity seems impossible.    One of the most impressive things I find about Mr. Sanderson's work, and that of fantasy writers in general, is the vast amount of ingenuity and thought that goes into the writing, resulting in an immersive world that sucks you in and never spits you out. At first, I'd thought that most of the world building would be done in the first book, but in \\"The Hero of Ages\\", Mr. Sanderson continues to expand the Final Empire, revealing more nooks and crannies to the world he'd created in the previous two installments. Not only does he take his readers to the different cities and towns outside of Luthadel--each with their own governments and conflicting viewpoints of the events unfolding--but he also brings them to the homes of the Terrismen and the kandra. The fact that the Final Empire only seems to be expanding in the final book shows just how expansive epic fantasy novels can be, and I believe Mr. Sanderson exemplifies this.    I think the same can be said about the characters of the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\" as well. They're constantly developing as people, leaders and heroes, never passive, and that's what makes them truly interesting and engaging characters. Take Vin, for example. We've seen her mature from a suspicious, scarred skaa urchin into a strong, confident Mistborn, who learns to trust and love in ways she never thought she would. Instead of keeping her as simply a kickass, deified Mistborn, however, Mr. Sanderson shows us just how much of a true hero Vin is as she struggles with the truths that are unveiled and the choices she has to make. Elend is another character who undergoes some great character development, especially since he has to juggle his newfound Mistborn abilities with his existing responsibilities as the Emperor of the Final Empire. Admittedly, there isn't as much romance between Vin and Elend as I would've liked (who doesn't like some juicy love here and there?), but the bond that exists between them is undeniable and strong. Another character I have to mention when talking about character development is Spook. A good number of chapters follow Spook, who previously played a more minor role in the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\", and in them, we see him grow as a person and a leader. Long story short, \\"The Hero of Ages\\" has incredible character development till the very last page, rendering the characters of the entire series memorable and inseparable from the readers' minds.    Unfortunately, I do have to say that I was a little disappointed by the plot of \\"The Hero of Ages\\". There is, without a doubt, exciting events that occur that kept me interested throughout. However, I felt like the storyline wasn't as 'tight' as it could've been. For example, there's a great deal of Sazed ruminating over his collection of religions, and it was a little too repetitive that it lost my attention. In fact, the first half or so of the book could've been condensed so that there wasn't any waffling and repetitions, which might've made the storyline more compelling and engaging. Nonetheless, the last half of the book was definitely exciting--my heart was pounding as I lapped up the last quarter of the novel! There were many times when I thought to myself, \\"Wow, this would look so, so cool if it were made into a movie\\", which goes to show how evocative Mr. Sanderson's writing is. The final twists that were revealed at the end tied in extremely nicely with all of the events and clues from the previous two books, like puzzle pieces falling into place. Very, very clever things going on!    Overall, \\"The Hero of Ages\\" is a thrilling, immersive finale to an incredible fantasy series, complete with an amazing, memorable cast of characters, an all-encompassing, magical world, and an intricate storyline that spans the entire trilogy. It's bittersweet to finally reach the end of the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\", but this is definitely not the end of exploring more of Mr. Sanderson's work! I highly, highly recommend the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\" to any fantasy lovers out there--this is an adventure you will not want to miss.    Rating: 4.5/5

I immediately liked several of the tracks instantly which caused me to purchase the cd myself. I really like it, every song. Its rare nowadays to get a cd where you like every track. It has a raw edge to it that is appealing to me. I am, for the most part, a classic rock guy and this has that classic yet fresh feel to it. Give it a spin!

B002T9H2ME|5.0|I came upon this movie a couple of years ago late at night. As an avid scifi fan, I anxiously gave it a try hoping that it would be at least a B rated movie as unfortunately, great movies in this genre are a rarity. I was not disappointed, I loved it. The soundtrack is also killer. I do not purchase very many movies as after you've seen it, it no longer appeals to me but this was one of those gems I had to own. I also purchased the soundtrack as I loved the music as well. If you are a scifi fan who has not seen this yet, get it, I believe that you will appreciate this one as much as I do.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I do not know who this Hugh Howey is, but he writes a great yarn.  It was recommended by a friend, and I read through the entire thing in a weekend.  Nice story, great writing, good characters--interesting premise with good development--<br />when does the sequel come out?
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awesome it will knock your socks off get it it rocks not like computer version but still really good.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|TED-this movie was not at all what I thought it would be. It was crude and had too much fighting, language etc. I don't think they did justice to this movie. It could have been a great story, with a great moral AND funny like anything without having to have another swear word every other minute. Would not recommend this to anyone especially kids! But even adults, rated R movies can be great and R-rated scenes can have their time and place in the context of the story. This sounds like someone just dumped a whole lot of trash into the movie script!
0810993139|5.0|Excellent condition! My grandson could never get it at the library because it was already checked out! He was thrilled!
0618680004|5.0|This book arrived in EXCELLENT condition. This is GREAT reading for us that really understand the delusion MAN has created. I reccomend reading &#34; THE END OF FAITH &#34; by SAM HARRIS.

B007NESBK2|5.0|This music video arrived in EXCELLENT condition.This is a must for fans of SADE! I went to see SADE live and this video brings back wonderful memories!
0810970686|5.0|Excellent condition!  My grandson said it was always checked out in the library and he could never get to read it.
B000067D4Y|5.0|This great movie draws you in-into the life of make-believe and what if?<br />i thoroughly enjoyed it. Lovely story line, acting, funny, spirited, engaging.<br />Music was amazing-just right for the film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Outta of all the Solitare games on line I like this one the best. It's fun to play, easy to understand and yet is still competitive.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|I'm shocked by the time ALEX got back to earth alive and all his body parts still intact ,and to feel his relief
0061780308|5.0|The author shows an incredible appreciation of dogs, motorcar racing esp. F1, but more importantly his understanding of substandard human behaviour of the ' evil twins' is unbelievable.<br />An extraordinary book that even the fairy tale ending which could have been omitted, does not detract from the examination of human interactions.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is one of the best and most inspiring books I've read in a long time. Now I just need to convince work to apply some of the principles.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I've always loved soap operas and this is the best way I have to describe this story and the characters. You get so caught up in their everyday lives that you don't want it to end. I hope it continues well until Eva and Gideon have grand children! Would love to see their love evolve pass the neediness into a secure and safe relationship. I want to see how they face their problems which are sure to come given their circumstances and histories. I truly enjoy these characters and look forward to many more books and chapters into their lives. I'm tired of romances that end when relationship are young and assume that they will have happily ever after.every relationship is great early on until life throws you curb balls. Is the love that survives that is truly worth keeping.<br />Keep them coming Sylvia! You are on too something! There is a reason soap operas were as successful as they were. :-)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|All of this book series is addictive. Can't wait to see who ends up the winner and gets to rule the empire. I am one third through a dance with dragons and am amazed at the twists and turns in the story and the shocking loss of some of the likable characters. The fantasy is not overbearing and there.is a similarity with the European middlle age history of religion, knights, castles and family feuds.
B008MJC6ZS|4.0|The Sneap done killed it again. This is a sonically crushing album that belongs in any metalheads CD or mp3 player.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I've never got so many compliments on a watch before in my life. I think I've had about 20 people comment and ask about it and I've had the thing for less than 2 months. It looks spectacular and it is the perfect blend of class and simplicity but can also go with a casual look. I haven't touched another one of my watches since I got it, and I've worn it dressed up and I wear it with jeans and a t shirt. I bought a black Fossil leather band to replace the cheap one it came with, and I absolutely love the thing.
B009ZE27US|1.0|This app does not even use your real thumb print or finger. Do not get it I is just a waste of time and data.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was my first time seeing this show and was impressed by the relations without a significantly bad person being mean all the time.  I get tired of that kind of show.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Ok so I'm a little disappointed. Maybe more than a little. I hated the ending to this book! It made me mad as hell. The book was fantastic until that point!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is addictive. I've only had one glitch and it was a major pain..but it was straightened out. This is ice cold fun.
B002BZOVLG|5.0|A great example of why Glyndebourne has such an outstanding reputation - the orchestra, voices, staging, and of course Mozart's music are all wonderful. Excellent film/audio quality.
1439110123|5.0|If you are working in the oil and energy-industry or if you just have an interest in oil then I strongly recommend this book.<br /><br />I'm working in the oil and energy industry which is dominated by risk-averse men with decades of experience. I'm however young and lack the experience and knowledge gained over decades. What to do?.. I have used this book in order to \\"come up to speed\\", to know the history of the industry and to understand the decisions of the oil companies. This book is nothing less than a masterpiece!
B00122X6WY|5.0|loved it. I will get more Kraftwerk albums. That's all I have to say, but I am required to write more words.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good re-creation of the book. The blend of the CGI and the real action was very seamless. The cast was excellent
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzle game. Not too hard, not too easy. Fun and mysterious. I just wish it was longer. I hope they make another.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I LOVED the next story to the series.  The 1st book had me hooked. The 2nd booked annoyed me some, there was so much arguiing and on/off between Eva and Gideon that it annoyed me. This one was much better I thought. I was disappointed the story didnt come to an end and HATE I have to wait to read the next one, HOWEVER, Im soooo happy to get to read more about Eva and Gideon! Ive always hated the end of a series, because I know there isnt anything left to learn about the characters. It feels good to get to the end, but its such a let down too.  Anyway, I saw a lot of negative reviews due to the extended series, so I wanted to put a good review out there for the book.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|its been impossible to put Down since I first downloaded it!! I really haven't concentreated on the whole rebuilding thing with the tree just let me play another round.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Lets start of by saying: people this is a series, not a trilogy. Where there are 6+ books and the authors are still writing more. Sylvia is not desperate, she just wants this series to be about other characters besides Gideon and Eva. If you don't like that she's writing more books, then read some stand alones.<br />Eva got on my nerves the first 2 books, but in EWY she is taking it like a Boss. Letting Gideon know what she wants and where she wants it. Of course that ain't no hard task for Gideon. He's made the ultimate sacrifice for Eva and she is helping him every step of the way. I love how their relationship is growing. How Gideon is not holding his feelings back and wants the whole world to know she belongs to him.<br />So you if don't like any of the other characters, then what's the point of a story line. We need characters, fights, twists and turns, the haters, that stupid family member we all hate, and best of all the nagging BFF that is always at your side. So if you don't like a story, move on to something else. For all you Gideon fans, watch out, he's back with a vengeance, full throttle, growling at your ears making your panties fall right off.<br />Thank You Sylvia Day
B00CATSONE|5.0|Inspiring for everyone,especially for young adults to read to understand that dreams are attainable through not giving up,hard work and imagination
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was hard enough to be interesting without being impossible.  The puzzles were varied and there was a skip option.  I really like the map that tells you where you have actions to perform.  The hidden object scenes weren't too annoying or too numerous.  Graphics and story were good.
B00992CF6W|1.0|apple product have already gotten the 7.0 update but we havent this review will stay a 1 star until this is changed
0425263924|1.0|The two first books on this series gave us a storyline with a closure.<br /><br />On the first book you had Gideon explaing his history with Corine and reassuring Eva. This is how it ended and even thought I wanted more and was looking forward to more i was happy and satisfied when it finished.<br />For the second book you had the dedective explaining Gideon's behavoir so again I felt satisfied, the mystery on Gideon's behavoir was clarified. Even though I did not know how this revelation will affect their relationship. I was happy because it concluded that chapter of the story.<br /><br />But the third book gave me nothing. No big revelations no mysteries solved nothing I was looking forward on learning more about Gideon's family and how they were connecting to the abuse. But nothing. Even if you skip this book and read Book No 4 you will still be able fill in the blanks because book No 3 adds nothing to the story line.<br /><br />This is why i feel cheated. Not because Sylvia decided to make a trilogy of 5 books!!!!!!!! But because she sold me a half book and thought I will not noticed.<br /><br />P.S. I am a big fan of Sylvia Day. I read all of her history books and of course the Crossfire Series  but I am very dissapointed and I wanted to be heard.
B00BHO70L0|4.0|This latest chapter in the Reboot:EVANGELION series is the most frustrating yet.  Shinji wakes up 14 years in the future, and everything you know about EVA is turned on it's head.  Friends turned enemies, NERV shattered, and the arrival of new EVA and their pilots.  The animation is top-notch (as always), and the EVA are incredible.  But the soundtrack really grated on me after repeated viewings, it's a bit &#34;off&#34; for the movie, especially in the EVA/Angel battles.  All in all, a great package, wonderful artbook, and clean menus make the &#34;Special Edition&#34; disc worth the extra money this time.<br /><br />REMEMBER:  THERE ARE NO SUBS!!!  If you cannot read Japanese, you will be lost-ish.  Honestly, I followed it pretty well myself.  But seriously, do yourself a favor and pickup a fan-sub version and watch that too ;)  It will help a LOT
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is really wonderful and very vivid, you can picture everything the author is writing. I cannot wait to see the movie but I'm so sad to see this awesome story end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super fun and a new twist on a temple sort of game. It's a blast to play and challenging in a good way.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|every song on this album is amazing and have their own unique feel. My favorite tracks are \\"I appear missing\\" \\"smooth sailing\\" \\"if I had a tail\\" and \\"my god is the sun\\" but every song here is great.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Good game if u have time to kill its a good app sorta like grand theft auto mixed with saints row
B00866JL96|5.0|I loved it, but I saw it before I bought it. It is a very good movie. Mines did not play well, but I got a refund and saw it on TV again (Stars). Still a move worth buying.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Holy book hangover here I come!!! This is definitely not what I saw happening in this book! I am beyond thrilled with where this book went. So many questions were answered but so many more brought to the surface. Sylvia is one amazing author who brings her characters to life. I absolutely cannot wait for the next book. I love love love me some Gideon & Eva.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|It was recommended to me by 6 other viewers.  I told 3 more people about  this series & they are watching it.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Really fun game. Good fps, and really fun for the kids and adults. I was playing this game with my sister and brothers an they loved it.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Great mobile Kindle sofware, I have on my home computer also. Is great free software, and very useful in the house
B00BHNR1KQ|2.0|i really don't know how to review this item. I would suggest that it sucked because my wife rented it while I was sleeping.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was expecting this book to be overrated, but it definitely lived up to all th hype. It's as mind blowing as The Lottery was when it came out.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book is a joke right? I mean I waited through 2 push back dates and this is what I get? A porn with minimal plot? The two other books were so much more sophisticate in their story telling and sex scenes that it doesn't even feel like this one was written by the same person.<br />I think the reason the publish dates were pushed back was so that Sylvia Day could completely take out anything resembling a plot. I salivated at both of the first books rushing to get through to see what happened, but this book was really hard to get through because there was just nothing happening. Just the same sex scene repeated over and over (if I read the word \\"pre-cum\\" one more time, I was going to scream!!).<br />I feel cheated especially with the way the book ended. I hope the next book is discounted because I think its just the rest of the chapters of this one.<br />Going to go read the \\"other\\" sex filled trilogy so at least I can get some sense of closure.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled upon this series by accident and I'm hooked! I'm about to go buy the next book and then anxiously await the third!  A series that is so realistic and plausible in this age of supernatural sagas is so refreshing!

0811876373|5.0|i have fun following the instruction on the book<br />this is the basic cake pops book ever!!! i bought it a long time ago i think but i'm still using it...<br />the recipe is really delicious...the decorations nice...but some are easy to follow some are hard...<br />but i was able to do the safari and the Halloween (my own version)...nice<br /><br />thanks bakerella
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have never returned a book and I hated to return this one. This was my favorite series up until now. Such a disappointment to wait so long for their happy ending, only to be thrown more curveballs. Why are more plots being thrown into the mix? I just don't understand:(
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Can't believe I have wait for another book.  Thought there to only be three.  I font know why people are give it so low stars.  It is still a good book.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|It is a great movie, and I enjoyed every minute of it that I stayed awake. I did fall asleep 3 or 4 times though. Unless you are sure you can sit through 5 hours of any movie, go with a &#34;short&#34; 2-hour version
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I cannot wait to read the next book. Very easy to read. The only drawback is that the book is so well written that when you come to the end of one chapter, it's hard to stop!
B000FC1RCI|5.0|A great mystery story, this book kept you guessing who the murder was up to the very end.  Mystery is not my favorite genre, but I could not put this book down.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I love sophie kinsellas books but this one was by far my least favorite. I didn't really like the plot or the back and forth pov between sisters... but thats just my opinion. Honestly this kinda is more like the books she wrote under her other pen name Madeleine wickham rather than the ones she's writen as Sophie kinsella.<br />Still deff worth reading. I just hope she writes another book in the shopahic series.
B0012GTZFC|1.0|Most boring book I have ever read in my life. If I used this book on my employees they would probably all quit. I like to use old fashioned ways of appreciating my employees. Especially the older ones that have stuck with me for years.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I had bought this movie years ago but misplaced it.  So happy to get it again and at such a reasonable cost.  It's a heart-warming story that I can watch over and over, and its Will Smith at his best.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wonderful.  So happy he realized what was there all along. They both deserve the love.  A special love that is a once in a lifetime love.

1400069289|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, made everything easy to understand. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend or random stranger!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This product is in perfect condition. It is my husband's early Father's Day gift and he loves it!! The seller was very prompt in shipping and it arrived with no damage. Thank you so much.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I loved it and have given it as a gift to friends and colleagues.  It will inspire you, make you think about the macro-situation regarding women and career, as well as give you some insight into approaching your own career and family life.<br /><br />I would recommend it for women in their 20's and 30's so that you may be inspired and maybe put some of her suggestions in action. I would also recommend it for women in more senior positions in their careers because it may inspire you, as well, to keep enabling the progress of women in the workplace.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love this show and Benedict Cumberbatch is my new crush!<br />I've watched the season three times now and about to rewatch the 2nd season!

B004SIP9Z6|5.0|Excellent Product and great Seller...
B000089A07|5.0|Great quality. I would definitely purchase or recommend. Got all sooner than expected.  I would use again for future references
B000002MY3|1.0|CD doesn't play , what a rip off, can not return it due to the fact  that it  was opened . Such a waste of money
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Being as the Eagles made a few bucks over the years, they were able to get the very best people available to do the video and audio for this project.  I'm a audiophile and bought this because of the sound quality.  The camera work and production is top notch as well.  I'm using it through some vintage stereo equipment, two channel only, and the effect is very pleasing.  Excellent sound-stage and imaging, well placed microphones on the stage.  People need to realize just how hard it is for the engineers to capture live performances, it's nothing like studio work.  The Eagles performance was typical Eagles....excellent as usual.
0241951453|2.0|I've seen the movie and although it's a 'classic' it didn't do much for me.  The novel was reviewed recently in a magazine (can't remember which one) and I thought I'd give it a read.  It is a very different story - more interesting than the movie, but the characters didn't hold my interest. I didn't care about them or the story.  Just my personal taste. However, the cost of the paperback was reasonable and I'm glad I satisfied my curiousity so I guess it was worth it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Been playing this game for a while...was annoyed when the update was made and I lost all my scores etc that I had from the previous game...this games seem a bit more interesting with the new additions made....It'll take some time to get back to where I was...the games has time  when it refuses to open and I would have to shut down my kindle and reopen..aside from that once the game gets going it works well...
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Bought this hoping it might be ok and it far surpassed my expectations. I felt I was walking with Harold on his journey. A great feel-good story, very evocative writing, lots of tears (happy and sad tears). Highly recommended!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|So far this is the best one but I haven't tried the Experiments yet! The first one was great and it keeps getting better.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|As a life-long cat lover, I have a weakness for any and all things feline-related, so when I stumbled across the cover of this slim volume on Pinterest, featuring an adorable feline author, I knew I had to read it. I mean we all know if any animal is going to be an author, if any animal has something worth saying, something the whole world needs to hear, its going to be cats, right? *wink*<br /><br />\\"Collected\\" by Francesco Marciuliano (who, I am now convinced, is a genius), this book is divided into four chapters containing poetically profound feline ruminations on Family, Work, Play, and Existence. Personal favorites include \\"This Is My Chair\\" (\\"Everywhere is my place to sleep / Perhaps you should just get a hotel room\\"), \\"Tripped\\" (\\"I'm sorry I tripped you on hard cement / But some men paid me five grand to kill you\\"), and \\"Elegy for a Toy I Broke\\" (\\"I can't believe what a cheap piece of crap you were / Seriously, I hardly touched you before you broke\\") -- every last one of them absolute gems of feline wisdom!<br /><br />The perfect, laugh-out-loud funny gift for yourself (if you're like me, haha) or the cat lover in your life, I Could Pee on This is an witty, funny gift book sprinkled with absolutely adorable photos. Highly recommended. And for those who prefer canines, Marciuliano is releasing a companion volume in June, I Could Chew on This, which promises to be just as hilarious!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I really like Sara Bareilles and this cd is wonderful a must have cd for your collection. I love the fairytale song.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I look back on this series with mixed feelings (most of them good...). Ahead of it`s time. Lee Majors said he was promised a<br />series of his own by the network after The Big Valley. Well, this was it. Some episodes are better than others, both writting and acting. Some are kind of boring. My favorites are the ones with Farrah, of course. She had unmatched natural beauty....not much brains. Also, I enjoy the ones written by Star Trek TOS writter D.C. Fontana. Also, the ones with Star Trek TOS stars such as Arlene Markel and of course, Bill Shatner (his first season episode was kinda weird).<br />  All that being said, the premiss of the show was good but it needed better, consistant writting/writters.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|The book was great. I felt like I was actually watching Castle. I would and have recommended it to friends and family.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book so much. I recommended it to my sister and she also fell in love with it. I would honestly recommend this book to anyone. Good twists that you would never expect
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Am looking forward to more editions of this rivitting and intriguing series.  Jeffrey Archer is one of my very favorite authors.
B0000VCZKM|3.0|While the movie itself is  well done,the quality if the firm was poor; it was not clear at all.. I was disappointed.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Had a copy for myself, loved it, so I bought another copy for a friend. We think it is great!

0893860220|5.0|I have never read anything on spirituality as clear and simple as Nisargadatta's &#34;I am that.&#34; It has the same ring of truth and authenticity as Autobiography of a Yogi.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I just still find it amazing that Channing Tattum and Jenna Dewan found TRUE LOVE on the set f this movie. After I think 5 years of marriage they just welcomed their 1st child :)
B000H7JD90|4.0|I purchased this after picking up 20/20 on vinyl (which sounds incredible). This was not as immersing an experience as 20/20 was on vinyl, but absolutely will not disappoint.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|What a book! I was definitely on the edge of my seat while reading this! Gideon and Eva have never been hotter! There were some definite monkey wrenches thrown in to this story and I'm kind of glad that Sylvia is writing two more books for this series BUT at the same time I'm also bummed that I have to wait and see what happens to Gideon, Eva, and even Carey.  Great job Ms. Day, I look forward to books four and five!
B009P0VLGI|5.0|This CD is the tenth anniversary edition of 200 km/h in the wrong lane. As a life long t.A.T.u. fan the 're-edition has to be one of the best in a long time. I love this CD and I highly recommend this CD to all t.A.T.u. lovers!! :)
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It trying to get the mystery shark.<br />Can I get minecraft pocket edition.<br />Please make it free for me. Thanks!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Absolutely could not put these books down. From the very 1st page of the 1st book in the trilogy to the very last page of the 3rd book Stieg Larsson captivates you and will have you engrossed chapter after chapter. A must read!
B00CL50LEC|4.0|Suspenseful yet moved along.  Great ending.  The characters were well cast.  Enjoyed the length, volume, and scenery.  Could have had just a tad more action.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|great story line, and funny music. My toddler runs through the house singing there songs. So colorful and fun. Best Dr. seuss mvoie made.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app it's so cool and has lots of blocks and cool things! And with the new update it has buckets spawn eggs and more! It made the game SO much cooler. I love it it's worth the money!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Awesome game for kids. I really enjoy playing it. The pets are so cute. My little sister also enjoys it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci at his finest.  It's been a while since my last adventure, but I am never disappointed with the characters or plot! LeCarre , Clancy,Martin,and Sheldon make bibliophiles think while continually leading them astray! Give me book two; do it NOW!
B00CBKXGPI|4.0|It's love it. G5 games are awesome i this don't<br /> like in a good part they make you pay for it i have only five cents so i can't by it so i have ti watch it on YouTube
B00COHAUD4|3.0|What do you get if you take a Grimm's Fairy Tale, \\"The Woman in Black,\\" and throw in a little bit of \\"Sophie's Choice\\"?  Well, \\"Mama\\" I guess, although I believe that in this case, the whole is less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />And this is too bad, considering that this film has such a strong start.  I really liked the cinematography, I really liked the CGI, and the color palette that the director chose fit the mood perfectly.  The story seemed to have so much promise, but it just never quite came together for me, and somewhere near the beginning of the third act I started looking at my watch.  Well, that would be if I wore one, I suppose.<br /><br />I thought that \\"The Woman in Black\\" was just a much stronger film.  Danielle Radcliffe gave perhaps his best performance there -- yes, surely better than \\"Harry Potter\\" although that fantasy series was good for the genre -- and I just felt that that film had a bit more believability to me.  Sure, the plots in both films require the viewer to suspend belief.  But \\"Mama\\" seemingly requires the viewer to take a huge leap of faith (which you might argue is somewhat fitting once you know the plot), and ultimately, I don't believe that there is enough of a payoff for that leap.<br /><br />I thought that Jessica Chastain was tremendous in \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" and \\"The Tree of Life,\\" and she's almost unrecognizable here at the beginning, although that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I knew she was in the film, but I did a double and triple take trying to recognize her, as she plays a role that is so different from what I've seen her in before.  I would say that she does another fine job -- not as good as those other roles, however, although to be fair she had less to work with here -- but she's not enough to save this near miss.<br /><br />Just by the numbers, I saw that the critics liked this film more than the average viewer.  On this one, I think that the critics perhaps gave it a bit of a pass.  My words are quite similar but the meaning of those words are quite different:  it's a pass by me.

0307476073|5.0|So many times I too have found that a literal journey over land becomes a journey into oneself,  especially in solitude for some of that time.  Reminded me I ought to do things like that again before my time is up on this Earth.

147674355X|5.0|I love romance novels but I was feeling like they were all starting to run together. Same plot, same character etc I almost skipped this one. Oh how wrong I was! NOT THIS BOOK. I am soooo glad I didnt miss this one!!! Thru the first half of the book I literally LOL'd a lot. The second half with all the twists and surprises had me crying. What a book, to bring fourth so many raw emotions and I liked that the surprises only made the love stronger (and there was no breaking up or cheating) just true love and hard times. I finished this book in one day and immediately passed it to a friend. And 3 days later Im still thinkin about how good it was. I can't wait for \\"Losing hope\\"!!!!!

B0000640VO|5.0|This is a brilliant, quirky, fun, silly, colorful, touching, and all-around charming movie. What can I say, watch it and see if it's up your alley. And the soundtrack is well known to be very good, even among music majors.

B00873GRU4|1.0|I only managed to get through 50 pages before giving up on this book, dull and pointless.<br /><br />Unfortunately I used the Amazon recommendations, second time I have been stung buy a low quality book.
1883217040|5.0|I'll try to keep this as short and concise as possible with the means of providing a small background of where I am from and how I found this book. Keep in mind, I did NOT purchase this book through Amazon. So where do I begin? In short, this book has CHANGED MY LIFE. This book is extremely user friendly and so easy to understand if you're new to the jazz world. Most of my musical questions in life has been answered due to this very book. For instance, as a musician I am now able to hear and familiarize myself  with the different types of scale harmonies aurally without using a keyboard! Furthermore, I am now able to transcribe songs and a persons playing/chord movements by ear, and then teach it to other fellow students and friends!<br /><br />How did I find out about this book? It's a really funny and interesting story. At a former college I was studying music with, I was one of those, \\"decent\\" \\"ok\\" piano players. Yes, I did have lessons... However, the lessons were solely focused on classical music. I wanted more and was interesting in learning to play Jazz but my teacher was a bit hesitant to teach me. Thus, this was my cue to finally take a stand and to do something about it. I found this book with the means of doing a little research on the web, and luckily I ran into a friend who had a copy of it. As soon as I began reading, I was hooked. The text was pretty basic, straight forward to the point, and had plenty of written sheet music examples to give your ears a musical reference on what the author was trying to say. For example, the author might say, \\"look at figure 6-73, play and listen to the beautiful sound of Phrygian harmony.\\"<br /><br />What's also pretty cool, you also get a brief history lesson about jazz in general, nothing too overly done. And to those of you who hate history, this might come across pretty boring to you but the author does a  pretty splendid job of making it enjoyable, and rather interesting. I also have to give Mark Levine props for throwing in little hints here and there on advance topics in the beginning of his chapters just to keep the reader pondered, and intrigued. It's sort of like following an enticing paper trail that never ends.<br /><br />At the moment, I am still reading this book and almost done with it. Frankly, this is one of those books a professor would keep hidden from you. And surprisingly, I can now reharm songs and easily regurgitate this knowledge to share with friends and family. One thing to note: This book may be titled \\"The Jazz Theory Book\\" but it's certainly not restricted just for jazz. Once you've read and understood the concepts, you will begin to see that other musical areas can be relatively easy to pick up from an application point of view. For example, Gospel music, R&B and such.<br /><br />In short, this book is a must get! I've told many friends about this book, but it makes me sad they haven't purchased it yet. Don't be fooled! This is well worth the money. Buy it now and save yourself years of wondering, invest now and use wisdom to form futuristic structure towards your practice time!<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />Don't forget to read the preface! It's possibly the most inspiring, important part of the book!
B00CL66FEQ|2.0|Not Barbara at her best, falls flat. Rogen is doing his standard. Only really funny at the end, not sure why it didn't happen for these two.
B008NR8YXC|5.0|I have long had Schiff's earlier recording of the WTC (among many others) and can readily compare this new recording with his earlier effort. The previous recording always struck me as quite competent but not so interesting as several others. His new recording is a different kettle of fish! His approach is more varied, with a lot of variety resulting from a wide range of tempi, touch, and so forth. His lack of use of the pedal works very well for him; the music is neither dry nor clipped, but nicely articulated. And he separates the musical lines superbly. Overall, this version is more energetic and interesting than his earlier one. The generally faster tempos in the quick pieces add the spice of virtuosity, which is not really apparent as such but merely as an amazing ease and fluidity. And in the slower pieces, like the C-sharp minor fugue in Book 1, Schiff delivers the goods with absolute assurance.<br /><br />Most of all, he is simply musical...to the extreme. In fact, it's hard to say it more clearly than he plays this music really REALLY well! This is a fantastic recording, and the piano sound is immediate and clean.<br /><br />This goes to the top of my pile of WTC for the piano, along with Gould. Gould, of course, is irritating and astonishing at the same time. Schiff is more \\"normal\\" if that's the right word, but he just plays these beautifully and (thank God) doesn't sing along. I can't recommend this recording more highly.
B008ROG6E0|3.0|It's one of those movies, like Dune, that you have heard about for so long, and it holds its place in sci-fi history, but when you see it for some reason you can't get over some of the older effects and time spent on inane sequences. I have to admit, I did not finish it. Worth seeing just to see it I guess. Maybe it added to the genre at the time it was made? Campy.

B005ZCXPP0|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this film. It was prefect for our mid-week date night. I highly recommend the film for older children (10+) due to the violence. The villain would likely frighten younger children. Lots of fast-paced chase scenes and humorous dialogue kept us smiling through most of the movie. It was wonderfully refreshing to savor the battle scenes, and the classic pairing of good versus bad guys fight scenes without ANY obscenities! Though the digital effects are obvious, the familiar storyline, solid casting, and clever allusions to action classics (Indiana Jones, Star Wars, etc) made for a solid movie.<br /><br />Go U.S.A.!
0439023513|5.0|By the time I got to reading this book I was already deeply into the characters and plot of the storyline from the 2 previous books in the Hunger Games series.<br /><br />A lot of people have told me they don't like this book although I could not see the series ending in any other way.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the descriptions of the scenes and how the characters fit within them.<br /><br />Give this book a read before the final movies are released so that you may imagine it all beautifully in your mind.

Expect to be entertained and drawn into the fire.<br /><br />Read this if you aren't a super critical reader (which I can be) or if you are interested in post-apocalyptic fair.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|One of the best movie of all times. I love it. GREAT. When it's on I'll stop and watch even though I have the DVD
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this app is great and everything, but I think that it would be great to be able to skip objectives for a certain amount of coins or a certain amount of gems, and you should be able to choose between which one to spend for it. I also think you should also add a volcano part to the game, with like lava pools and being able to run inside the volcano. Overall, I think it is a great game with a few tweaks that need to be made.

B0059XTV4Y|3.0|Coming out at around the same time as [[ASIN:B004X4R49Y The King's Speech]] and purporting to explore the love affair between King Edward VIII  and twice-divorced American woman Wallis Simpson (the catalyst for the events of the aforementioned \\"King's Speech\\") this Madonna directed film is certainly big on style yet sadly low on substance.<br /><br />The problem is that the story of Wallis and Edward is told through the irrelevant framing device of a contemporary woman desperate to get pregnant with a husband who grows steadily more abusive as the film goes on. It's hard understand why we should care about any of this when the focus should obviously be on the couple that the film is named after.<br /><br />Wally Winthrop has two things in her life: an unhappy marriage and a strange obsession with Wallis Simpson. The latter leads her to do a number of vaguely creepy things such as dressing like Wallis, haunting the Wallis and Edward exhibition at the auction house, spending thousands of dollars on a pair of gloves that belonged to Wallis, lying her way into a meeting with Mohammed al Fayed in order to read Wallis's letters (how is this even POSSIBLE?) and carrying on a number of conversations with Wallis which I can only assume are meant to be elaborate delusions.<br /><br />Whilst all this is going on she kindles a romance with an employee at the auction house who is described by another character as (I kid you not) \\"a Russian intellectual slumming as a security guard\\". He's handsome and charming and mysterious and sensitive. He makes an offhand comment early on that Wally reminds him of his wife, and sure enough, we learn later that he's not a divorcee but a lonely widower whose Bohemian apartment is filled with literature and art. Honestly, he's as much a fantasy as Wally's hallucinations of Wallis are.<br /><br />When one gets hold of a movie called \\"W.E.\\", one doesn't expect it to be about a rather strange woman's attempt to gain control of her own life by daydreaming about another woman. I think Madonna (co-writer/director) *may* have been trying to make a statement about how ordinary people can become too swept up in the love stories of celebrities, often forgetting to live their own lives in the meanwhile. Hey, if anyone could give us an insightful look on that theme it's Madonna, but what we get is the story of a woman living a life of wealth and luxury with an obsessive interest in Wallis Simpson and a sleazebag for a husband. Wait, wasn't this released at about the same time as Madonna's divorce? The whole thing comes across as an elaborate fan-fiction starring Abbie Cornish as Madonna's self-insert OC, making herself the focus of a film that's technically meant to be about Wallis and Edward.<br /><br />It's with them that the interest truly lies, and it's a darn shame that they're so short-changed. Andrea Riseborough is beguiling as Wallis, capturing the woman's speech patterns and mannerisms, and James D'Arcy manages to portray Edward as utterly besotted without rendering him emasculated. Madonna also ensembles a wonderful supporting cast for the period half of the film: Natalie Dormer, Katie McGrath, James Fox, Laurence Fox and Judy Parfitt, but they only get a couple of scenes each before the story reverts back to Wally and her comparatively banal unhappiness.<br /><br />Things like the courtship and secret love affair between Edward and Wallis are glossed over and there are simply too many gaps in their love story for it to have any resonance. Having watched the film, I gained no real understanding as to why Edward chose to give up his throne for Wallis. They meet, they flirt, and suddenly Edward is declaring his intense passion for her. Likewise, I never got a sense of the affair's historical impact or how scandalous it was at the time. Edward's reading of his abdication speech plays out with a lot of emotion, but it exists in a void. There's no sense of how it affects the country or the royal family on a larger scale. It just sort of happens.<br /><br />The film also raises some questions concerning the happiness of the marriage and the couple's association with Hitler, but doesn't even try to offer any answers. Every time it begins to reveal some insight into how exactly Wallis felt about the constitutional crisis that she (partially) caused, we're treated to another twenty minutes of Abbie Cornish's curiously expressionless face.<br /><br />But regardless of its problems, this is an exceptionally beautiful film to look at. Lavish attention is given to costumes, props, music, hair, makeup and other technical aspects, rendering this a feast for the eyes and ears. There are endless montages of the rich and famous dancing, feasting, socializing and enjoying themselves - and let's be honest, we all secretly love watching that sort of thing, even if it's just to complain about it. If you can focus solely on the period scenes it works well as a companion piece to \\"The King's Speech\\"; in fact in some cases it's better. Andrea Riseborough completely embodies Wallis Simpson, and although Colin Firth walked away with the Oscar for his portrayal of Albert, I think Lawrence Fox bore a greater resemblance to the man.<br /><br />It's a strange little movie really, and probably appealing only to those interested in the subject matter. Whereas \\"The King's Speech\\" was accessible even to those who didn't know a thing about the history and figures involved, \\"W.E.\\" requires at least partial awareness of the historical context. Try and enjoy its visual flair and keep the remote handy for fast-forwarding the irrelevant stuff.r scale.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another great read by Sylvia Day. She does not disappoint. I could not put it down and I was left wanting more at the end! If you've read the first two, you will love the third! Way to keep up the heat Sylvia!!! Book 4 cannot come soon enough!
B009E9R2OK|5.0|I tried playing the Amazon's MP3 files of this album but found they were of not great quality.  Likely best to just get the Audio Only Blu-Ray of this album.  (I'm not sure if the video version includes a Uncompressed PCM 5.1 stream.)<br /><br />Although this is an audio only Blu-Ray, it does export a black and white video title page with the title of each song, per HDMI spec.  Personally, I just want the audio and I find the audio file provided is one big blob with no separate tracks.  Guessing any software playing the stream will use stream seeks to find the tracks.  (And seems to be evident by the slow response when using Windows software players.)<br /><br />An interesting note, I usually tend to avoid LIVE albums as the audience screaming tends to overwhelm the music.  Not so with this mix and seems they tended to keep the audience to minimal levels and only heard during the beginning and ends of the tracks.  But within the Amazon MP3's, all I heard was audience and bass which was very unlike the quality of the Blu-Ray Audio version.<br /><br />MULTIPLE STREAMS PROVIDED:<br />Thanks to FFMPEG/FFPLAY, here's a quick listing of streams:<br />Stream #0:0[0x1011]: Video: h264 (High) (HDMV / 0x564D4448), yuv420p, 1920x1080 [SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9], 29.97 fps, 29.97 tbr, 90k tbn, 59.94 tbc<br />Stream #0:1[0x1100]: Audio: pcm_bluray (HDMV / 0x564D4448), 48000 Hz, stereo, s32, 2304 kb/s<br />Stream #0:2[0x1101]: Audio: pcm_bluray (HDMV / 0x564D4448), 48000 Hz, 5.1(side), s32, 6912 kb/s<br />Stream #0:3[0x1102]: Audio: dts (DTS-HD MA) ([134][0][0][0] / 0x0086), 48000 Hz, 5.1(side), s16, 1536 kb/s<br /><br />Surprisingly, it looks like Stream #0:2 is the best quality containing 24/32 bit versus DTS at only 16 bit?  Albeit, the streams do vary slightly in quality from track to track.  So far, my favorite is Stream #2 providing Uncompressed PCM 5.1 sound, exhibiting the best quality. However, I use Linux and seemingly Linux is not able to play through DTS-HD Master streams through to a receiver, and only use pass-through DTS.  As such, I'm biased towards PCM and PCM-5.1 streams.  (Seems Cyberlink PowerDVD might be remixing or changing the stream header in high-definition or bit-stream mode, but the stream still seems to have identical rates when playing on Linux.)<br /><br />The DTS stream is a bit more dynamic or contains more coherent drum beats (or the attack wave of each drum beat creates more of a pop sound) when compared to the other PCM streams.  PCM streams sound somewhat flattened.  I guess that's why they call it DTS Coherent Acoustics.  The DTS stream is also of slightly lesser quality as previously mentioned, but the DTS encoding makes up for this and any quality difference is almost inaudible.  (I think it's been stated, consumers will notice very little difference, unless they're amplifying and playing the music within a large area?)<br /><br />When playing back the Uncompressed PCM 5.1 stream, ensure you're playing through a connection capable of handling the bandwidth such as HDMI.  (S/PDIF will downmix to two channels, or software may compress the stream to a compressed Dolby/DTS if you're lucky.)  It's difficult to tell if my receiver is playing all six channels over HDMI or only playing two channels, while mirroring the others using it's high quality decoder chip.<br /><br />I should also make mention, after relaxing after dealing with all this encryption stuff for the past weeks, I finally sat back and listened to both PCM5.1 and DTS streams.  The PCM streams seem to be slightly overloaded with loudness (AKA Loudness Wars Wikipedia), so I opened the PCM-5.1 stream within Audacity and lessened the gain to -6dB (or -3dB to -6dB) on channels 1-2 or the main two channels.  (The two channels were significantly louder than the other 4 channels.)  After doing so, I noticed the music sounded much more like music, similar to the older style Led Zeppelin recordings.  Further reducing the gain again only on these two channels resulted in a retro 1980's style Robert Plant vocal solo, similar to his riffs within the Nirvana and Tall Cool One albums.  (See my note made on 2013.11.03.  Seems my Yamaha RX-V375 defaults to PEQ Mixer after using YPAO.  Switching off the mixer and ensuring no other Enhanced modes are used, the center channel now definitely seems louder requiring no volume level changes to the channels.)<br /><br />ENCRYPTION:<br />Unfortunately, using Linux MPlayer with AACS to play this Blu-Ray is impossible as MPlayer complains vigorously about encryption errors.  I had to again use the expensive $50 Linux version of makemkv program to copy to local hard drive; wasting space, time and energy.  I am not a fan of forcing honest people who pay for their products to have to struggle to use encryption and preventing them from enjoying their products.  Shrugs.  I did notice once I decrypted the streams onto another Blu-Ray for using within Linux, the Blu-Ray would play just fine within the Windows proprietary Blu-Ray Movie player.  Plus one here, for not screwing the honest consumer over. ;-) ... Movies tend not to play properly within the proprietary Windows player after copied, giving some FBI warning.  Guess it's probably wise to expect blacklisting or problems traveling to other countries criminalizing consumers for playing purchased commercial Blu-Ray media within Linux?<br /><br />FINAL NOTES:<br />You mileage may very with this review, as it's written according to only what I hear.  For those seeking higher quality than CD Audio, or higher resolutions than 24 bit 48000 Hz, these are above the range of human hearing.  If you have problems with playing Blu-Ray media like I do, might be best to stick with CD or DVD media.<br /><br />2013.06.10 - After several weeks, I've finally learned how to extract the audio files for my enjoyment and have written a Gentoo Wiki \\"FFmpeg - Extract Blu-Ray Audio\\" for others.  Another headache with the Blu-ray audio, is making sure the software playing device is playing at the highest audio quality possible rather than down mixing.  Best method so far, buy a audio receiver capable of playing 24 Bit PCM WAV files via USB storage devices.  Very little degradation versus HDMI and S/PDIF!  Also, apparently the Yamaha RX-V375 will only play 16 Bit PCM Microsoft WAV files and not 24 Bit PCM WAV files!  Will require a Yamaha >= RX-V475 receiver for 24 bit playback via USB?<br /><br />2013.06.11 - Added notes about loudness on channels one and two.  Cited DTS as being more coherent on drum beat attacks, and DTS Coherent Acoustics.  Minor grammar corrections.  I'm really glad I purchased the high-resolution.  As they say, avoid the eye-candy and go for meat.<br /><br />2013.11.03 - Just found my RX-V375 defaults to PEQ Equalizer when using YPAO to setup the speakers.  Using PEQ remixes the audio and apparently lowers the volume of some of the channels of PCM 5.1 streams.  Setting the Equalizer to OFF, and ensure any Enhance modes are switched off, seems to play the audio a little louder within the center channel now.ulted in a retro 1980's style Robert Plant vocal solo, similar to his riffs within the Nirvana and Tall Cool One albums.  (See my note made on 2013.11.03.  Seems my Yamaha RX-V375 defaults to PEQ Mixer after using YPAO.  Switching off the mixer and ensuring no other Enhanced modes are used, the center channel now definitely seems louder requiring no volume level changes to the channels.)<br /><br />ENCRYPTION:<br />Unfortunately, using Linux MPlayer with AACS to play this Blu-Ray is impossible as MPlayer complains vigorously about encryption errors.  I had to again use the expensive $50 Linux version of makemkv program to copy to local hard drive; wasting space, time and energy.  I am not a fan of forcing honest people who pay for their products to have to struggle to use encryption and preventing them from enjoying their products.  Shrugs.  I did notice once I decrypted the streams onto another Blu-Ray for using within Linux, the Blu-Ray would play just fine within the Windows proprietary Blu-Ray Movie player.  Plus one here, for not screwing the honest consumer over. ;-) ... Movies tend not to play properly within the proprietary Windows player after copied, giving some FBI warning.  Guess it's probably wise to expect blacklisting or problems traveling to other countries criminalizing consumers for playing purchased commercial Blu-Ray media within Linux?<br /><br />FINAL NOTES:<br />You mileage may very with this review, as it's written according to only what I hear.  For those seeking higher quality than CD Audio, or higher resolutions than 24 bit 48000 Hz, these are above the range of human hearing.  If you have problems with playing Blu-Ray media like I do, might be best to stick with CD or DVD media.<br /><br />2013.06.10 - After several weeks, I've finally learned how to extract the audio files for my enjoyment and have written a Gentoo Wiki \\"FFmpeg - Extract Blu-Ray Audio\\" for others.  Another headache with the Blu-ray audio, is making sure the software playing device is playing at the highest audio quality possible rather than down mixing.  Best method so far, buy a audio receiver capable of playing 24 Bit PCM WAV files via USB storage devices.  Very little degradation versus HDMI and S/PDIF!  Also, apparently the Yamaha RX-V375 will only play 16 Bit PCM Microsoft WAV files and not 24 Bit PCM WAV files!  Will require a Yamaha >= RX-V475 receiver for 24 bit playback via USB?<br /><br />2013.06.11 - Added notes about loudness on channels one and two.  Cited DTS as being more coherent on drum beat attacks, and DTS Coherent Acoustics.  Minor grammar corrections.  I'm really glad I purchased the high-resolution.

B00CTSDDVO|4.0|The story is about captain kirk and his crew and their new enemy kahn. There was a movie in the old style with the name \\"the wrath of khan\\" which has some analogies to this movie. It is worth to watch it before this one, go check it out here http://amzn.to/11t8rVW
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I had a difficult time believing this movie was controversial when it came out just prior to WWII.  People thought it was too pro war. Based on the true story of Sergeant  Alvin York a true hero of WWI.  Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan together again, plus a real 16 year old girl played a 16 year old girl.  Not like todays action films but a very great story of a man who has to decide which is more important not killing or protecting his friends.

0425263924|5.0|I truly wonder if people took the time to write anything how you would think about your book only selling for $2.99.  I mean come on this was a book that had few to no spelling errors and your all complaining about the price really?? Okay thats my rant and if you don't like it don't read it.  Don't be rude to the author saying she is being greedy do you know most of the time publishing companies set pricing.<br /><br />Okay about the book..... Very good well put together.  EVA and Gideon they are awesome they have great chemistry I truly don't think she could write everything about them in one finaly book.  Too many loose ends to tie up.  I am a huge fan of this series and SYLVIA DAY's!! Love the beach scene! Keep up the good work! :) Waiting on the end of my seat for the next book! Can not come soon enough!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I actually really enjoyed the book! I even stayed up all night trying to finish it because I so desperately wanted to know how their story would end. And must to my surprise, the book didn't end. I was left hanging and I am sure feeling it today. I invested so much into the characters and I truly thought we were going to know the secrets and have things wrapped up somehow.... but after such a long wait.... now I need to wait even longer.... 2 more books?!<br /><br />I'm not sure how I feel about Eva marrying when she felt they weren't ready. I'm not sure about how I feel that they married, when she felt they weren't ready AND he still can't sleep in the same room as her?!<br />Why the drama with Brett and now Mrs Vidal??<br /><br />I'm feeling \\"lost\\" and not sure I would have wanted to read it knowing there was going to be more books. I don't like waiting! ;)
B005N7CA3A|5.0|I given Secret Codes And Battle Ships Five STARS!!!!<br />Darren singing about a love maturing into a fully developed love, like the sun shine that opens a small tiny rose bud into a full bloomed mature rose opening up to the sun. Which I can see inside my head when I listen to his CD Secret Code and Battle Ships. Darren puts, love, poetic emotional words once again into his music. This CD made me cry for I to felt emotional love like this and lose him back into world to see him on more. Darren has an ability to listen with his heart. Matthew 13:16, NKJ version. But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for the hear;<br />I love, God Walking into the room and Roses. No matter what the credits say don't stop what your doing keep going with your faith you will find what your looking for. God Bless You Darren and your Family!<br /><br />My Name is Rose.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this story. Very well crafted and thought out. Likeable characters that I got very attached to. Looking forward to reading much more in this series. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great read, thought provoking! Great writing.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|\\"The Bat\\" debut of multi-purpose Norwegian Jo Nesbo is what I would call a great book, because it is well structured, studied in detail, enriched with historical details narrated from a particular perspective.<br />In the book are told two stories related but separated in time by fifty years: Norway in 1945 lived through the eyes and the tales of the exploits of five young soldiers soldiers at the front and a series of crimes that are somehow related. The swing of the stories is the driving force that forces you to move forward to see clearly.<br />The main character, does not shine for his originality (lonely, self-destructive, alcoholic past ...) but, nevertheless, he is able to conquest and fascinating the readers, avoiding to focus on himself all the attention indeed distributing to the other members of his team.<br />Reading opinions here and there always appears the tireless comparison with other Scandinavian authors, as if you were to elect the best strength. In this case, personally, I think that the style of Jo Nesbo is far from Scandinavian, remembering more the American.Leaving then the stereotypes I would recommend this thriller to those who want to immerse themselves in a complex story, yes, but well written and which also opens insights on how the historical experience can, in some cases, also to determine the future of life. In addition, the novel offers a different interpretation of one of the dark periods that characterized European history in general and, specifically, in Norway.<br /><br />Wish to comment this review?

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I very rarely review but I had to with this app. I had the free version on my and my daughter's Kindles since 2011 and we loved it. Definitely would recommend for relaxation or even sleep assistance.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|As in all of my reviews - No Spoilers*********<br /><br />First I would like to say I don't understand why every one is so upset about this not being the last book - thinking it was a secret.  Sylvia has been very open on facebook and her blog that this isn't the last book - this shouldn't have been a surprise to those who follow the author.<br /><br />Now for the book - I really really liked it.  I felt that we got more in touch with both Eva and Gideon and for the depth of their love.  I mean come on Gideon is still all that and then some.  I actually liked Eva more in this book - she stopped running and faced things on head on.  I felt that she grew up in this book.<br /><br />Gideon - what can I say about him - he is the total package - I love his devotion to Eva throughout the book.  He too has grown in the book and has learned how to trust more as well.<br /><br />I think Sylvia has a great writing syle and she knows how to tell a story.  No there wasn't any twists and turns in this book but that was ok with me.  I can honestly say that I can not wait for book 4.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have had this free app since 2011 on both my daughter and my Kindles. Love it so much I downloaded the full version.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. Much like the real ones I play. I do wish the daily bonus would add more. The daily spins would be better if you were able to hit higher pay outs. Just one spin a day is fine but when you only receive a small amount of power ups, I just think those who return daily should be able to hit higher. Also, some days I don't even receive a spin. I think if you were able to collect more free BB' s it would be a 5 star game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I Loved it!<br />I've read a lot of bad reviews but I'm definitely not affected by them.<br />I honestly love Sylvia Day's writing style. Period.<br />Well, if you are updated with your favorite bookbloggers (I ♥ Aestas book blog!) or just checking Sylvia Day's website, you will know that she informed us, fans of Crossfire series, that there will be a 4th and 5th book. Which, for me, is great news coz we'll have more Gideon, right?! Yes! More Gideon! Gosh I love him....♥♥♥
1400079144|5.0|I bought this latest Dan Brown book for my Kindle, planning on saving it<br /> to read on an upcoming trip.  Well I made it a whole two weeks before I<br /> brought down and started reading the book.  And once I started I<br />couldn't put it down.  The detail and storyline sucked me right in.  I<br />know that many of his books get plenty of attention and the entire plot<br />and details are broken down and examined by professional to determine<br />the \\"truth\\", and I have one thing to say about that.....it's FICTION,<br />with enough truth thrown in to make it believable.  Why do you think he<br />is such a popular author....it's because you want to believe the story<br />he is telling.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.  And what a ride this<br />story was.  Buy it and share with your friends!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Seriously, that's how I'm starting to feel as more and more authors decide to maximize their earning potential (and my book budget) by stretching out a story over seemingly countless volumes. Enough already. I'm done. If a book is supposed to be the last in a trilogy, I expect three books. Three. Not five. I purchased this book in the store because I had forgotten to preorder it. Now I wish I had checked the reviews first. I hope that readers will finally make their displeasure known with this sneaky, manipulative sales tactic. I'm not going to spend $50 to read a story that isn't all that great. It was good, until this volume at least, don't get me wrong. But $50 will buy me a lot of other stuff I'll enjoy a lot more. This is the last of my hard-earned money that Ms. Day will get. Maybe if enough of us refuse to keep buying this stretched out pay-as-you-go storytelling, writers and publishers will get the message. Let's take a stand against being ripped off.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Manual not explicate enough. No mention that you have to be connected to your amp by the two RCA jacks.<br />After making several attempts to convert LP's I did a sound check of the MP3 that I converted and found I was getting the sound of chipmonks through My speakers.<br />After connecting RCA jacks to my Ipod Dock and doing the whole process again. The sound quality was excellent.<br />No where in the manual does it say you have to be connected to your amp or Ipod dock.<br />Many hours of frustration figuring that on out.<br /><br />Thank you Sony for not putting a parts list in manual and also for not mentioning the required element of connecting to amp for it to work properlly
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The production quality is everything I expect from an HBO series.  The story is great, keeps moving, lots of things going on to keep your attention.  Plenty of both sex and violence, drama and exploration of a slightly different world.  The actors really seem to get into these great characters they play.  The costumes, sets, and special effects are all incredible.  It is hard not to get totally absorbed in the story.  While I will admit it isn't for everyone, if this is your genre, I can't imagine anything your won't like about it.  I have a hard time pulling myself away from it once I start watching.  Can hardly wait for season three to come out.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much, I have read one of the King and Maxwell books before.  I am looking forward to the new TV show, I hope it as good as the books.
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|Honestly I feel a bit ripped off reading this book. No new ideas, nothing really interesting or novel being said. Waste of time and cost $5.<br /><br />Will stick with reading the blog.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />In response to James:<br /><br />I felt a bit bad giving a 2 star review because I do like you as a person - especially that you are willing to be so human publicly. I just felt that the book didn't give me anything new personally, especially taking into account that I am familiar with much of your previous writings.<br /><br />I would say I agree with your thesis - that employees are screwed. One of my issues with the book though was that I didn't find the solutions offered to be compelling. Not everyone is going to be a Justin Bieber or be successful at starting their own business. Most people don't even have the savings to be able to experiment with lots of failed businesses.<br /><br />I agree that being an employee means you are likely getting the raw end of a deal. And you are right, that everyone needs to start thinking about how to take control of their own lives - because most likely eventually - whether they like it or not - they will have to. I just don't know what percentage of people would be successful going the routes that you mention in the book.

B00BXUG0KU|4.0|Growing up with jazz and Chet Baker, I recall that few jazz musicians and followers of the music took Chet's vocalizing very seriously.  We had listened to albums like Sinatra/Riddle's \\"Songs for Swingin' Lovers\\" and \\"Only the Lonely\\" not to mention Ella's Songbooks on Verve, the soul-baring readings by Lady Day, the coloratura yet swinging performances of Sarah, the poignant and often sardonic drama of Carmen McRae, the expressive art of Nancy Wilson. Chet, by contrast, was not a \\"singer\\"--i.e. an interpreter who illuminated the dark corners of a ballad or brought into clarity the subtle meanings of a Porter or Hart lyric. He \\"vocalized\\" the lyrics with a pleasant sound, making few if any adjustments based on the words or even mood of the song.<br /><br />But if Diana Krall can, by using a breathy voice and low-key approach, attempt to resurrect a musical tradition dependent upon unguarded sentiment and melodramatic, open-throated emotion ([[ASIN:B008FSCNTK Glad Rag Doll]]}, Elias has every right to employ her low register and unforced, sultry sound to evoke the music of a musician whose primary strength, like Elias', was not his vocalizing.  Moreover, it can be said about her that, like Chet, there's an \\"androgynous\\" quality about the voice, projecting an ambiguous, indeterminate sexuality that, after Chet, became increasingly notable if not fashionable in popular music.  In fact, eventually Chet's memory would survive by way of posthumous advertisements for clothing modeled by the image of a young Chet.  (Ironic, because shortly before his death, Chet can be heard in a British interview lamenting the lack of work for jazz musicians back home. After his passing, his estate no doubt made more money than his \\"live\\" music ever did.)<br /><br />For those who like the \\"sound\\" of the voice (and unique but clear elocution of English), this album will no doubt be well-received.  The piano is often secondary, especially when guitar replaces it altogether, bringing the voice prominently into the foreground.  What's inarguable is the program--each one of 14 tracks is a chestnut from the Great American Songbook (for which we can thank Chet and the recording artists referenced above).  Perhaps the one song that has become identified with Chet is \\"Let's Get Lost\\" (also the title of a fine indie film about his life).  On this tune, Elias best captures the Chet Baker posture (or \\"karma,\\" to many who remember '50s \\"Cool Jazz\\"): it's the dispassionate emotion of a gifted \\"natural\\" who simply went where the music led him.

B0056C6XIA|3.0|Purchased for A Friend Well, that’s everything I can think of. Let me know if you have any questions. I’m happy to help.
B0053TMP24|5.0|The book has over a thousand reviews; what can I add? A few impressions, that's what.<br /><br />I liked this book better than the first book in the series, \\"The Lost Hero\\". The reason is Percy Jackson. I saw him grow into the hero role throughout the \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" series so the action, heroics, and leadership displayed in the present book seem natural. In \\"The Lost Hero\\", I knew nothing of Jason Grace's background. As a result I didn't quite as readily accept his role in that book.<br /><br />\\"The Lost Hero\\" and \\"The Son of Neptune\\" are supposed to mirror each other somewhat. Each involves an older demigod with amnesia leading two younger novices on impossible quests. Yet, the parallels aren't exact and that keeps the book from getting too predictable. A great example is Camp Jupiter. It is analogous to Camp Half Blood but the differences are also quite striking, the New Rome city being the most obvious feature.<br /><br />The two new leads, Hazel and Frank, were more interesting to me than Leo and Piper from the first book. Both have an element of tragedy in their backgrounds and I'm surprised Riordan introduced them both in the same book. Riordan also crosses things up somewhat by making Frank a son of Mars and a genuinely nice guy. Hazel's father Pluto automatically gives her some dramatic depth.<br /><br />Riordan continues to mine the inexhaustible Greek and Roman myths for material in hugely entertaining ways. I did not see the part about the Amazons coming.<br /><br />I loved the depiction of Alaska as the land beyond the gods.<br /><br />The Kindle edition was formatted perfectly and is a very convenient format for material of this sort. A lot of Greek and Roman terms are thrown at the reader; it's nice to be able to remind one's self what a \\"spatha\\" is.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I've been trying to pace this series so the final volume will be released around the time I finish the next to last volume. I'm not sure I can hold out that long.t long.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|This series is funny and improbable. I use it as an escape from regular life and a way to wind down.
0307279189|5.0|I've just finished \\"Born To Run\\" a few minutes ago,and, while my \\"afterglow\\" is still burning, I wanted to write this simple and sincere review.<br /> \\"Born To Run\\" offers so much fun information about a broad range of subjects - Anthropology,History,Physiology,and much more -all presented in an entertaining and easily digestible form. But,the key here is this true story, and the facinating and truly memorable characters that McDougall collects along the way, as he follows the seemingly impossible task of putting together \\"Greatest Race the world Has Never Seen\\". I don't think I'll ever forget Caballo Blanco.<br />  This book isn't necessarily for runners only, but, it sure did inspire me to get my 65 year old lazy butt back out on the road after a lapse of too many months.
1480054542|5.0|My heart breaks for Megan.  She lost her parents when she was little.  After a abusive marriage, she finally decides to come to her brother (the only living relative she has left), he is in a car accident and killed.  She has to move across the country to take care of his things.  She finds the life he built in Pride to be a wonderful one...one she wished she had been able to share with him.  He had made best friends and business partners with the family next door.  When Megan got there, she was made part of their family as well.  The oldest boy, Todd and Megan have some serious chemistry.  I love Todd!! He was perfect.  I loved Iian and Lacey as well and can't wait to read their stories next!!

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|That says it all.  As implied from his introduction many books back - he is change.<br /><br />What a great book; pivotal plot points from past books are detailed further to explain Kaleb's involvement / knowledge that helped move this story forward.  The story is primarily focused on the Psych with the Changelings having minor role while Humans get a brief mention.  Characters from past books are visited / seen / involved so it's great to get a glimpse - but that's all you will get - of their life.  This is Kaleb's story - Kaleb and his obsession and his trainer and his enemy (not going to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read this).<br /><br />I loved the story, I wasn't sure how Nalini was going to manage to 'conclude' and transition the original story to the next continuation story.  (The races can't have the same conflict throughout all books written about this world -that would make the story grow old and stale.  That is something that this author would not do.)  Kudos to  her, not only did she manage to wrap the original story in away that made my inner soul hum in happiness but she also pique my interest for future stories.  I want to find out about the pupcubs (how many and what kind), I want to know about the future of the Psych, Adam, Silver (hmm Adam and Silver - that's an intriguing thought), Aden and Vasic... I really want to know about Vasic!<br /><br />Ok, now that I've concluded reading it once and enjoyed basking in happy contentment for 12 hours over how much this book didn't disappoint me.  I am going to start it again.  This time read it a little slower for all the fine points I know I missed the first time around.<br /><br />For those of you that haven't read it... pick it up.  It's worth the hard back price (if you don't own an ereader).  For those of you that got recommended this without reading the rest of the series - read it, you will enjoy it.  But you will enjoy it more if you go back to the beginning and read the first book - Slave to Sensation.  I envy you getting to read these stories for the first time.  Actually I am going to join you after I reread this book - I am going to start the series again from the beginning.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B001TH16DI|5.0|I really enjoyed watching these Star Trek movies again. Now in Blu Ray on my Big Screen with surround sound, it was better than in the theater. The quality was great. I am original Star Trek Fan from the 1960's original TV show. We did a spoof play in 1969 I wished we had recorded it with our own cast of characters and called it Star Trek the beginning of real space travel. It wasn't until years later did the first Motion Picture come out.

159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's novel, And the Mountains Echoed, contains just about everything I like in a novel. There's a big cast of recognizable, complex characters, who experience the broad range of life: love, heartbreak, hope, loss, success, failure, caring and hurting. Across decades and generations, Hosseini uses multiple narrators in alternating time periods to weave a family story. These characters make choices that we all recognize: we don't control what will happen, but we try to take the next step that we think is the best thing to do. The prose is well-crafted, and I finished the novel with a great satisfaction that Hosseini presented our human condition with empathy, wisdom and skill. Any reader who enjoys the messiness of family stories and the consequences of life's choices, will find much to enjoy in this finely written novel.<br /><br />Rating: Five-star (I love it)
B00CX1TPF0|5.0|My kids and I loved the movie. It was nice to see some new twists with an old classic. It was also nice seeing a strong female actress. Violence yes, sex and nudity no. Oh and I love Ewan McGregor everything!
0670014893|4.0|The latest novel from David Cornwell writing as John LeCarre is titled A Delicate Truth. Cornwell proceeds without delicacy to yank from the headlines all the problems with the current war on terror and his views on what's amiss. The novel presents characters who behave in ways that begin with self-interest. Closely held secrets mask the reality of a pivotal event for members of the cast. Cornwell grabbed me with the story from the beginning, and kept me engaged by the clever ways in which he allowed the situation to increase in complexity as the novel progressed. By the end, the outcome seemed frustratingly clear, and was very satisfying. Read an excerpt, and if you're at all curious, chances are you'll enjoy reading this novel.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)
B00CT2P6VA|1.0|I purchased and downloaded this app on my Samsung Galaxy rugby pro but it freezes up on the splash screen and then it force closes. Looks like a great game but I can't even play it now that I've purchased it.
1607066017|5.0|This was the second graphic novel the woman who worked at our local comic book shop recommended to me and I'm just as pleased with this one as I was with [[ASIN:1607066599 Revival, Vol. 1: You're Among Friends]].  Again we have strong female leads who are mothers but this time we also have a strong male lead and they both kick butt while defending their baby.<br /><br />The universe that Vaughan and Staples have created is part fantasy and part science fiction with weird creatures natural, magical, and mechanical.  The world is brutal yet lovely with unique settings and complex characters beyond the family trio.  The plot moves quickly as befits the story yet we have enough material to feel connected to the characters; we feel when they are in danger and rejoice when they succeed.<br /><br />I hope the viewpoint character is hinting that Vaughan has fully thought out his tale because I want more.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Bored on a weekend? This is a great book to read, easy going, really funny, love the main character, and had fun with supporting characters, hoping the others books are as funny and enjoyable at this one.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This is a book that reads more like a series of blog posts rather than a sequential book hammering home a singular point. But, in fact, it does have a point: how you can be less dependent on those around you and develop enough self-reliance to achieve your desired goals. Unfortunately, after reading this book, your goals may somewhat change and you may find yourself on a different life-path than the one you imagined for yourself when you sat down to read.<br /><br />Written in an irreverent, breezy style, there is nothing really new or novel in this book, but that is so true of almost every other book that deals with reality and commonsense.<br /><br />Personally, the value derives from revisiting a number of issues that should be reviewed on a regular basis. Both as  attitude adjustments and suggestions for further growth. At the current price point, this may be the cheapest and most effective self-help book currently being offered. If only one thing in the book resonates or urged you to greater performance, it will have paid for itself many times over.<br /><br />That is not to say that you won't find gross stupidity in some of the material. 3-D printing of humans as a metaphor for holographic video conferencing comes to mind.<br /><br />For me, the chapter titled, \\"Don't Have Opinions\\" was representative of the books style, tone, and content. Commonsense advice that resonates -- and, unfortunately, is too quickly forgotten over time as we turn our attention to the vagaries of daily living.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, part of the book sounds like it was written by the master-mind gurus who sell information products and write amazingly productive sales copy. But it is probably Altucher's entrepreneurial bent that brings it all home.<br /><br />Full disclosure: James Altucher was well-known and admired by me prior of the publication of this book, as I have read many of his writings and heard him speak on a number of occasions.<br /><br />Now go buy the book andstart to transform your pathetic life or supercharge your productive capabilities.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I waited so much for this book, and started reading at midtnigh june 4, next day i could not help myself and read the reviews, and learned it was 4th and 5th book on hold, REALLY?

WHY? I hate the &#34;me tarzan you jane&#34; part of Guideon.<br />Eva.. Oh dear Eva, i loved her so much, but this time i felt i was reading Anastasia (which i hate) why on earth she had to be the best friend to Brett? God that was so stupid ( and please Dear Silvia, we kow Guideon is hot, you don't have to mentiom it every 3 senteces)<br />Cary..

As other reviewers have stated, she has a very elementary style of writing, and overuses the same phrases over, and over, and over.<br /><br />I could not get past the \\"long fingers\\" and \\"Holy crap!\\" statements.<br />I have no clue why someone would enjoy this book, no clue how the author even received a book deal, and will NOT be reading any of her other books!

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book I think is the best yet. I loved how Gideon and Eva's relationship improved & flowered. I think I may have fallen in love totally.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|Pre-review note for fans of the TV show Game of Thrones: If you've ever thought to yourself, \\"Gee, I love this show so much I'd like to read the books, but the first season of the show is supposed to be so faithful to the first book, and I don't want to read 800 pages of stuff I already know,\\" and wondered if you should just start with book 2, A CLASH OF KINGS, here is what you need to know. Yes, you are safe skipping book one. You'll miss out on some worldbuilding & backstory, which are neat, but you won't feel lost. And yes, unlike Season 1/Book 1, there are some pretty major differences between Season 2 of the show and A CLASH OF KINGS. The list of changes is long, and some of the differences really surprised me.<br /><br />And now on to the review.<br /><br />I think? Maybe? Because it's hard to write a review when I have no distance. I haven't been so obsessed with a book in a really long while. I haven't felt so immersed or engaged, so eager to find out what happens next (yes, even though I already know). I want to read, and then I want to talk about what I'm reading, and then I want to read some more.<br /><br />This is not my usual sort of book. Good characters meet bad ends. The characters I root for are hurt and hurt and hurt again, and there's no reason to believe they've got a reward in store during the as-yet-unwritten finale. I think: Oh, I should not love Arya so much, I should not love Bran so much, or Daenerys or Tyrion. They can't all win. They're not going to make friends and get along. But I can't help it.<br /><br />It's hard to explain why anyone should read this series. It seems like an act of masochism, doesn't it? That's part of the reason why I avoided it for so long. But a book that can hurt you is a book that can move you in other ways, too. And the good moments, the character growth, the triumphs...man, they are so satisfying.<br /><br />I read a blog post that pointed out something obvious I should have seen myself. The classic fantasy plot is about a young man who becomes King. That's the trajectory; rising to power is success. And this is a novel with ostensibly the same plot -- there's a throne, it's in jeopardy -- but the books are about the people who surround the kings. The wives, the sisters and brothers, the advisors and vassals. The contenders to the throne (with the exception of Daenerys, who starts the book ruling a clan of 50 people) aren't our POV characters. A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is a total inversion...and attaining power, in this world, is just as dangerous as losing it.<br /><br />I love the way that GRR Martin has set up the Houses, with images that stick in your mind like burrowing worms. Winter is coming. The iron price. A Lannister always pays his debts. He keeps this sprawling world and cast comprehensible because the imagery is so succinct and memorable.<br /><br />But each character interprets their own family legacy in a unique way. Despite the importance of family, despite that strong stamp of imagery, biology isn't destiny. Some of the Lannisters are foolish (Lancel? Yeesh), and their family words can be a doom or a blessing, depending on who's talking. Every character can choose, can do what's expected or what's easy or what's safe, to seek advantage or do what's right. So the simple image, the character of the family in the words and the banner, is elaborated, extended, perverted or rejected.<br /><br />The same with gender roles. There are characters -- especially the older characters -- that that fit the common types. Men who fight and lead. Women who look pretty and offer support. But those are the minority. Among the men, key characters include a dwarf, a eunuch, a cripple, a fat bookworm. Awesome characters that you love and root for, and you see how strong and capable they are, even if not a one of them looks pretty sitting on a horse in armor. The women hold their own in politics, but the book includes two key women who are evolving as fighters, driven by vengeance, who don't need to be pretty to be compelling or important.<br /><br />At this point, I feel like the series is about change. The characters who survive are the characters who adapt.<br /><br />I think I have been blathering on for a while now. To sum up: personally, I really enjoyed A CLASH OF KINGS. It pulled me deeper into the world, made me more attached to the characters. This is one of those series where more is really more.nce, who don't need to be pretty to be compelling or important.<br /><br />At this point, I feel like the series is about change.

1612930425|5.0|For most people, Pride & Prejudice is either a classic, or a bore; here's why:<br /><br />The arguments of its critics usually hold that it is:<br />Boring<br />Too difficult to read/too many unnecessary words<br />The plot/characters are shallow<br /><br />Pride & Prejudice's fans believe the novel is:<br />Fun/ironic<br />Well written<br />Engaging Characters<br /><br />I happen to love the book for the above mentioned reasons, but I can see how some people might find it tiresome.  The story is slow, there's so denying it; so if your not enjoying it, it will get boring.  The book can be difficult to read, especially for the first time as there is a lot of superfluous lines; I happen to enjoy the fluffy language, though it did take awhile to become used it.  I suppose you could argue that the characters are shallow, or that there is no ground-breaking plot. I don't believe it was meant to be; the story follows a family of five sisters, all looking for love, amusement and trying to stay within the proprietary boundaries of their time.  A simple plot no doubt, and it is all how you perceive it; if you're expecting a sappy unreserved love story, prepare for disappointment- reservation and propriety played huge roles in Jane Austen's time, and so you will find.  If you enjoy fine, perhaps a bit superfluous writing, irony, reserved but amusing characters, and appreciate that time period, you probably will like Pride & Prejudice.  If you prefer more obvious humor, simpler writing, a more adventurous plot, and unreserved characters, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The bottom line is, Pride & Prejudice as well as all Austen's novels demand a certain taste in reading that you have or you don't.  The latter mentioned science-fiction fans aren't going to see the beauty in this story's subtle humor or characters.  However, if you lean towards the former group like me, Austen's works are probably right up your alley.<br /><br />Enjoy... I hope!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This was a good book. Great plot but not well written. Would recommend to everyone to read. I would read this book again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't like reading but this series made me cry, laugh, and just about everything else a person can do. If it were me in there situation i wouldn't last a day. I think that people need to use the characters in this book such as katniss and adjust to her lifestyle. I feel we would all be much happier if we did.
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|I didn't have a DVD or BD copy of Ghostbusters so if you already do, this might not be necessary.<br /><br />But I liked that this was remastered in 4K.  Looks great in 1080p for an old movie, but you can still tell it's an old movie because all the effects are the same.<br /><br />The UV copy is a nice bonus because now I can play it on my phone tablet anywhere.<br /><br />It's a classic sci-fi/comedy and I can't wait till my kids are old enough to enjoy it together.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|The app works great right from the start.  Good User Interface.<br />Supports an amazing number of cameras. The Pro version is a good value.
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|This was an interesting series.  A different spin on the story.  As it is from Merlin's view, many  of the details are different from the original story by T.. White.  But the characters are intriguing and each element is explained .  However, one must see the entire<br />series, 1 through 4, otherwise, #5 will make no sense.  If you like King Arthur, and want to view the legend with alittle more<br />blood, this one's for you.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the acting and story.  I appreciated that the actors weren't artificially polished and pretty.  It let the actors and story stand on its own.  I highly recommend you make yourself a cup of tea and then watch this film.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Never preordered a book before and after reading this I never will again.  The characters do little to no development and the book has no closure nor a setup to the next book.  Was not worth $9.99.  Too bad because the characters are well loved by fans and had potential to be great.  What a let down.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|after awhile of playing it gets repetetive and boring. but it probably would be great for kids to use or horse lover's might love it. idk

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I enjoyed the information, how Brown seems to teach sneaky like in his storytelling. If you enjoy mystery and mystical stuff then you will like this as long as you aren't in too big of a hurry
B009B8YZKS|5.0|this is as far as fans will at present get to a full length movie. as this is the us version which seams longer tha the standard uk version, it still is a great action based film, lots of acton and of course the main star the masterchief and ther iconic warthog. a must buy for any true halo fan, lots of cool extras to the disk.
B00BJO5SXK|3.0|PRODUCTION: 4/8<br />VOCALS: 5/8<br />CONTENT: 5/8<br />ENJOYMENT: 5/8<br /><br />GRADE: D+<br />Consistent album with lame production and equally lame delivery.<br /><br />PROS<br />- consistent themes and atmosphere<br />- humourous and twisted lyrics<br />- Tyler's flow complements the beats well<br /><br />CONS<br />- subpar, simplistic production with nothing impactful; erratic drums<br />- delivery is monotone and unexciting
1401322786|4.0|I love Mitch Albom but I prefer his previous books to this one. Perhaps it is because previous stories seem more &#34;real life.&#34; To me this one is more of a fairy-tale. The story is still good with meaningful lessons.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|this movie will bring tears to your eyes, to think of such a faithful dog to his master, and that in end end a statue of the dog was placed in the same place where he waited. it was a moveing  story.

B003NHRIVQ|5.0|this was a great movie, as it was about a father daughter relationship that went from sad to  good but with a sad ending i really liked it and would recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read all the reviews, and I was shocked. Though I can see the irritation if you thought it was the end, however I read several weeks ago if not longer that there would be 2 more books. My initial reaction was elation, I love this series & couldn't wait for more.  The level of hostility about the series not ending is baffling to me. It is a good story, enjoy it! Who says the magic number is 3 to end a series? And if you don't like it, don't read it. But if you read the first book or 2, you will regret not reading more. This book is hot!!<br /><br />Now more importantly to the book review. This book is gah!  I can't come up with coherent thoughts after finishing it. Gideon is so primal & male, there is no way around being completely turned on by him. He is one of my favorite fictional boyfriends! This book went further& explored more of their histories & sexual encounters. I like Eva as always, she is real. She isn't perfect, she is flawed & beautiful. The writing shows what an amazing pair the two are together & the attraction is palpable. Kudos to Sylvia on another amazing book.  I look forward to do much more of Gideon, Eva, Cary, & the whole cast of characters.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I waited a long time for this book and was left feeling bitter. At least the first 2 had decent cliff hangers. This one just stopped..there was no BIG revelations no REAL drama...it was just blaaaah. I was expecting so much and received so little.<br />There were so many story lines that she could've ended the book with to give us hope for what was to come but it just didnt happen that way. I'm not even the least bit excited to see how the story ends anymore. ESPECIALLY not for $9.99 Shame on you Sylvia Day, Shame on you.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|Great show and lots of snippets of his real life when he is not singing. He's a real guy! Very likeable

1781162646|5.0|What a fabulous book King has written for our pleasure this summer.  This story had everything in it.  Coming of age (as others have said), horror, mystery, mystery.  My only gripe is that it was short and I finished it way too quickly (kidding of course).<br /><br />Anyone who loves King or good fiction for that matter will enjoy this book!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|downloaded as the free app of the day, but I would have paid for it if I had had any idea how effective it is
B0028KKBD6|5.0|Im not sure if I am the only one but Rita is terrible, she drives me crazy!! She is so not good for Dexter she makes him seem so boring, Dexter is so much more attractive when he is with the other quest star actresses!! Lets get rid of Rita!!!  She is thinks she is so smart now and she is so bossy. If she was still with Paul she wouldnt think she was so strong!!!  ugh!! when did she get so full of herself?

B00AZMFO9U|3.0|\\"This is not a retirement home, it is a madhouse.\\" A home for retired musicians is in danger of being shut down so the residents decide to put on a show in order to make money to keep it open. Everyone's part and songs are picked and they are ready to go, until Jean Horton (Smith) shows up. Old feelings and new problems show up and threaten the show. Going into this I was expecting a movie along the lines of the Best Exoctic Marigold Hotel. Being young I did like that movie but probably not as much as I would as if I was older. This one is OK but geared way more toward an older crowd. I will admit that even though the movie is OK Billy Connely makes this movie and he is hilarious. If you like opera you will most likely like this movie too. It feels like I'm rambling on in this review but really there is nothing much to say other then the movie is geared toward an older opera loving audience. Overall, I liked Best Exotic Marigold Hotel better but if you liked that one you will probably like this one too. I give it a B-.
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|I am still listening to this, and have not yet made up my mind if I really like it or just like it. It is a bit different to the early heavy metal DP stuff, more mellow, if I could ever say that about DP but I think that is the influence of Steve Morse...and maybe age :) I still miss Richie...but oh well!
B007G51UV0|5.0|Very quick and concise install, the Asus Z77 motherboard line is extremely easy to put together. I had absolutely no issues of any kind, it booted to the Bios on the first try and within 2 hours of initializing the project I had the OS in and was tweaking the system. One of the easiest builds I have done.  Sincerely: Brian D. Williamson
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|While some of the early reviews made me hesitant to start reading this book, I found that they mostly complained about the author and the extension of the series rather than the story itself. Let me tell you, I'm so happy I ignored them. This book, like the others, was fantastic. It is a continuation of Eva and Gideon's story and an insite into a flawed but wonderful relationship... plus a ton of steamy sex scenes! There is so many places to go with this story and lots of secondary characters that also need endngs.... so while the endng was somewhat abrupt, I'm glad there will be another book that wraps up not only Gideon's and Eva's story but also Cary's, Corinne's and Megumi's. Plus G and E's relationship is really just beginning... this novel starts right after Reflected and is only a few months into their relationship... a relationship that definitely deserved to be explored... and if that takes up to five books then that's great!!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This show has so much to offer! Drama, suspense, controversy and great new developing story lines. The introduction of the battle between heaven and earth, and the demons and the angels, is riveting. I love the cliff-hanger with Crowley, and can see some many more story arcs coming from this! The titans and cleaning their messes up will give the boys a lot to do, but what really fascinates me is the story of the relationships between the brothers and the people they love. This is the backbone of the series for me, and I hope this gets expanded in much greater detail as time goes on. I  would love to see Dean and Lisa figure out a way to make it work, and have the same for Sammy. What is going to be the best is when you bring God out of hiding to take care of the mess that heaven has become, and bring order back to the world the way that he had originally created it....  Keep up the great work guys!
B005UG542S|5.0|Like &#34;Deathly Hollows, Part 1&#34;, this moive is dark - visually and contextually (is that a word?). Of course the book was better but the movie was so visually stunning. Tied up all the loose ends. These characters, who have been our &#34;friends&#34; for so many years will be missed.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|WTF THEY HAVE DICTIONARIES EVERY WHERE I GO WHATS NEXT PEOPLE NOT BUYING THE XBOX 1 Amazon should be ashamed of the self for doing that Wes Craven I have a good new movie for you it is called a nightmare on book street  that could be a good movie because the remake of the nightmare on elm street  2010 was stupid how freddy Krueger looked he looked like a puppet why could it not be robert englund that movie should be burned because. Ok im getting of track just do not read this book is  not  good no matter what . Bill Gates fan 98
0812983459|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. What an original storyline featurning a very ordinary middle aged Englishman who feels compelled to do something extraordinary - and takes us along for the journey.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This Book is so boring that  I died even though give it a more popular part in this horrible book I wasted my whole summer reading this book that the people who made this book should feel horrible and have no life I would watch paint dry then read this book again even thought kids will need this for school I have better things to do the read this book that people do not know about for wants make a better book that has more updated words even some street talk  for once this book should be a book that has to be on a nook because how crappy this book is I bet Chuck Norris Could not beat this book no madder how long it takes him so yea what's up if someone reads this this is Bill gates fan 98
B000UZPIAW|5.0|From the first page I was hooked, so to speak. I`m awed that Nikki gave us the chance to see a truly honest account of his life through these couple of years. In a business where image is everything, he shared it all, a real look at the excesses, the disgusting habits (and I reference not so much drug use but the total lack of hygiene, ewww!) He allowed us to see him at his worst, and it was not pretty!  It is so inspiring to see he fought his way out of the dark hell he was in to become a better person who can enjoy life and give to others. All I can say is Nikki, thank you for the truth!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I just started this game and it is going good. The tasks amounts keep you wanting to play to succeed. I wish that there was a way to see the amounts of the buildings were from the task bar...also the constant tasks to post on facebook are a bit annoying.
B008J4L3E6|5.0|I could not put it down once i started reading it i just love her books. It is great knowing i can take my kindle any where i go.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|A very good book. Love the mystery. Probably now one of my favorite books. I plan to read more books by this author
0307352153|5.0|As a life long introvert, this book provided useful information and support that I wished I had had years ago! Introverts unite!<br /><br />The book was in great shape, and it arrived ahead of estimated delivery date!
B000BISBDY|5.0|What's there to say. If you like that kind of music, you will love the CD. Great voice, interesting lyrics. I like it!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I have to admit it is amazing.It was hard at first but as I practiced it got easier.I have beaten it a few times but other times I get close to beating it.BUT IS SCARY.The graphics are so good that my hair stands on end.
B000KCHZK6|3.0|or maybe I just got tired of her. I definitely did not get into this one. Still lying around somewhere.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Although Colin Firth, as Bertie, does not physically resemble the real King George VI, I found through my own research that this movie is very true to life.<br /><br />I've enjoyed it over and over and have recommended it to many people.  Now that I have the DVD, I can watch it whenever I want.  If someone else hasn't borrowed it, that is.  :)
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I love these stories but this one was more analytical than emotional. While interesting, I prefer the stories that have an emotional tie to them, but that's just me.
030789701X|5.0|This book is dense, heavy, 100% full color.<br /><br />The cover is smooth, matte printing all around (looks texture-y, but is actually ultra-smooth.  The end papers are a light grey parchment style, about the thickness of standard copy paper (20#).<br /><br />The weight and feel of the inside pages is magazine-style:  light, semi-gloss, thinner than copy paper-- maybe 60# or 80#.  With the book coming in at 1120 pages and thicker than 1 and 3/4 inches (4.5 cm), I'm not sure they could have used thicker paper!<br /><br />It came with two unattached inserts:<br />  - a gate-folded poster of a dragon wall.  It's short but wide, at 9.5&#34; by 24&#34;<br />  - a thick, full-color, double-sided sheet of cardstock with a code to unlock &#34;Your Bonus eGuide&#34;<br />The first insert was inside the front cover. The second was cellophane stuck to the outside back of the book as sort of a back cover information block so people could see what you got inside the book without tearing open the cellophane wrapper.  Bonus code facing in, so it can't be seen.<br /><br />Finally, a large poster is folded up and attached to the inside back of the book by a perforated strip.  It's a double-sided map with tons of labeled places and items.<br /><br />If you are a fan, you will be thrilled with this.  If you are thinking of giving it as a gift, you can be sure of scoring a hit with this.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Like how Alicia is basically loyal and truthful. Love her kids.<br />Peter is loyal to Alicia even they have there problems.
B00992CF6W|3.0|You can't play with friends with iPads because the kindle fire hd can only use outdated updates ...Amazon please update soon!!
B001TCNSOI|4.0|It is intriguing . Even more so because it is a true story. The muderers have been around since the 20's . It is so sad, but true.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Not only a wonderful story but also interesting pieces of history to discover.<br />A wonderful read about two strong women
0810983915|4.0|My 8 year old son has been reading the Wimpy Kid books throughout the second half of second grade at school.  He loves them.  This is one series I haven't read yet, and plan to soon.  Once I read the first couple I'll edit my review.  But, I love that my son has found a series of books that he really enjoys and always looks forward to when he can get the next in the list.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a game that is fun for all ages. A good thinking game for younger kids yet challenging for adults.  Well worth downloading!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This movie was done very well. The acting was excellent, the plot compelling, and the execution flawless. Very good family movie, no cussing at any point, which proves once again you don't need to cuss to get your point across. Kudos
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|The hubby and I are Yoga newbies.  We love this CD when we are doing yoga or simply relaxing.  Great assortment of songs, we highly recommend.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|The story was very bland and the actors lines were so bad that they had to supplement them with curse words every other sentence to try to make their point. Poor taste in story development, this movie could have been much much better.
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|This movie is wonderful.  It is a little gory, but it's a slasher film parody.  It's going to be gory!  It's a hillbilly slasher story told from the viewpoint of the hillbillies.  Some scenes are pure bliss.  Every time I grab an ax to cut some wood, I yell to my wife, &#34;Hey college kids, we have your friend!&#34;, and it's always funny.  If you like comedy and don't mind a little gore, SEE THIS MOVIE!  You will not be disappointed.
B000002INR|5.0|The solos in this album are amazing! They have the sound I always look for in a band, I love the 80's hair metal! This is the first album I bought from this band and I'm glad I did!
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I always Loved Tom Cruise movies. I love the action, the intrigue, the self he puts in his film's Thanks
B004KPX4W2|3.0|Take the time, the new one is coming soon. Looking forward to seen the new one, I just hoped that it would had being on HD.
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|A very powerful, enchanting score by Basil Poledouris. It's great to have the original 1982 release in addition to the complete score.
B008RC72G8|1.0|NOT a comedy, humor was sparse and flat.  In fact I cannot really think of one single scene that made me actually laugh. NOT appropriate for the PG 13 audience. (in my opinion, not appropriate for anyone) Littered, read, trashed, by an abundance of filthy language and sexual scenes that were nasty. Dark. NOT, repeat, NOT a kids movie if anyone wants that. The acting was mediocre, the script terrible.  This movie was boring, plot-less, and stupid. I kept waiting for it to get better but it just didn't.  The only thing suspenseful about it was wondering what dumb thing they would do or say next.  There was just no story.
B0033AI4PM|4.0|I love this film, and to get it on blue-ray was great looked like a new film. They just do not make them like this any more.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Soliair is a fun card game good for passing the timr. It is not totally mindless. It requires one to leep ones mind on what is happening.
B00CBLQCO4|4.0|It's great to enjoy a modern day MI6 intrigue from John Le Carré. His style hasn't changed much and the storyline is more familiar to us now as compared to the 70's. The only fly in the ointment is the ending. We may never know what happened...
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We liked this series. It's not what I expected but in a good way. Would recommend to anyone in to legal shows
B00COHAUD4|5.0|One word - CREEPY. I picked this one to watch with the family on Mother's Day. There were some creepy parts and some that were just okay.  It was a good rental.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I find this app to be one of the most useful I've used. But I am concerned about the privacy issues. For that reason I can't recommend it.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|First rate quality DVD, sounds great loud, learned a-lot from this movie, well put together, flowed appropriately for a documentary.
0307279189|5.0|A great read.  Interweaving his quest to find the distance runner El Caballo and the Running People of the Southwest, with other stories of his past and of the history of distance running; races and pioneers of the sport -- this book is hard to put down.  Besides a great story, the book also offers insight into running form, technique and the mental toughness required. The latter half of the book has several insights into building and finding a better running shoe, and once again reiterates the importance of biomechanics in physical activity, training, and sports equipment -- especially over-padding in our running shoes (thanks go to Nike).
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|I was fortunate to see Thin Lizzy in the 70's with Phil, and I saw them again opening for Judas Priest in 2011. In 2011 my expectations were not very high simply stated how do you replace Phil Lynott? The short answer is you don't but the T.L. I saw in 2011 were pretty tight and they played the classic Lizzy tracks very well. Fast forward to 2013 and the new CD first of all it is a damn good and you can hear the Phil Lynott influence. I like the fact they decided not to use the Thin Lizzy name. The songs range from good old fashioned hard rock to Irish influenced folk. All in all a great tribute to the Legacy of one of the better bands i grew up and have always enjoyed. Buy it you will not be disappointed.
B000022TSY|5.0|Following 2 bikers moving dope and on a journey across the southwestern US, constant wanderers spending time in prison, on a commune and more. An amazing score compliments expansive scenes of Western US. Timeless, Historic, snapshot of an era. Shocking ending. I Recommend.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|A short book but welcome on Kindle. Nothing I can add about Le Carre that generations of betteer reviewers than me had not said. Don't miss it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I just love this show!  The acting and the writing are excellent. Every time I watch it a notice new details and enjoy it even more. The fact that it's a modernized version of the original tales makes it more appealing than making up new material.<br />I can't wait for season 3 to become available.<br />.  I<br /> .
B000V86OKG|5.0|This show is amazing, intelligent, addicting, unique, and e everything in between.  I recommend it to anyone and everyone.  Beautifully done.
037582913X|5.0|I loved this book when I read it to my son and then I loved it once again as I read it to my grandchildren.  This buildup to the end is delicious as it the surprise ending.  We do exaggerate as we read, so it does add to the atmosphere.  Charing, delightful and a great addition to every library.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This show is addicting, intelligent, and just so well done.  It is so interesting and captivating.  No matter what your moral construct, you find yourself really really enjoying Dexter and his ways.  I love this show, and so far season one, I might have to say, is the best although I am not completely through the series just yet.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|My kids and I LOVED this movie! The plot was great and the animation was stellar! Forget the kids, it held my attention throughout the whole movie and that's saying something. We watch this a lot.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its great but the only thing is the iphones and ipods are getting the update and the kindle fire wont release it that's what I hate
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|To be honest, I kept reading trying to find something to hold on to, and except the part where Gideon proposes, there was nothing else in there. You should probably just wait for the fifth book \\"in this trilogy\\". Hopefully it will give us some kind of closure. Because considering how long i waited for this book,  i felt royally disappointed.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is sooooooooooo fun!!! For girls that like to do spa get this app it's like an actual spa. I personally loooooove it.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|If you like challenging puzzles that require you to work on them, this is a game for you. I find it to be a bit of a time suck, but for those times when you need to be distracted (like stuck in a two-hour pile-up on the freeway) this is a great way to tune out.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Fun movie to watch over and over again. And anything with David Bowie is a plus. Nice story behind it as well. And has fun songs as well,.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|Vampire Weekend expands their sound with this textured album.  Not as up tempo as Contra, but much more complex.  Needs to be listened too multiple times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The good thing is I don't use my pc the bad scaring other people's worlds it dosent save it all the way other than that the game is amazing
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really like this book. I think all of them are great, but this is the best one yet. I can't wait for the other books to find out what happens. I wish they were ready right now. Please don't wait to long to put the other book out.
B0055QYKQO|2.0|The VRM cooling on this is poor.  The result?  If you OC (or even if you don't in many cases) your 8350, it will throttle the voltage to your CPU under load to prevent a fire.  The UD5 does not have these issues (at least to the same degree).  Buy it instead.  I am debating replacing it with a UD5 or putting the VRM under water.<br /><br />Reviewers here and elsewhere who claim otherwise are almost certainly blissfully unaware that their 5 GHz overclock actually runs at 1.4 under load.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|LOVE THIS!!!<br />But I amazed...How does it work? it's missed 1 time but it was on a REALLY obscure person...pretty cool!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I bought this on a whim because my kids asked for a new game. They both figured out on their own how to play this and do well.  That speaks volumes to me. 5 stars.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I flew out of Teheran just 5 days before the embassy was taken over. It was easy to imagine that I was back there. The only difference was that Thahnt-E-Jahmshed was wider than they showed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|First book I have read by this author and am planning on reading more. Very interesting and suspenseful plot with an ending that leaves some loose ends.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|I thought it was going to be a chick flick but was pleasantly surprised. It put me on the edge of my seat.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Great app. . . . .  haven't used it in a while but when I had it, it seemed to work pretty well for me.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|This is a great hard rock album. Megadeth isn't trying to be a thrash band here, yet the negative reviewers act as if they are or wish they were. Judging it for what it is, it's fabulous. All the songs are solid. Forget the reviewers downgrading it because it isn't thrash and enjoy a great rock album. Megadeth still delivers.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Greatest show I've ever watched in my life! Love this show to the fullest I'm a huge Walking Dead fan so even though I've already watched season one, two, and three I just had to get them also on DVD its always nice to have the complete seasons. I've re-watched this season with my sister as she never seen Walking Dead before and she loved it. Only thing I don't like about this DVD is that it seems to maybe have some deleted scenes? I know that on Netflix it shows whenever Lori cheated on Rick with Shane whenever they both went in the woods  together and did their thing, but it didn't show that scene on this DVD so I'm not sure what other scenes I might of missed that were not on the DVD but on Netflix. But yeah other than that it's a great DVD I highly recommend buying.
B00005JMJG|4.0|I saw this film when it first came out (in 2004?) and loved it. I always have to share movies I love with people I love, so I bought it (used) for my fiance to watch. It took him at least an hour to get into it and he appeared to patiently endure it for my sake. He had no idea what was going on, and I didn't want to spoil the satisfaction he would find in finally &#34;getting&#34; it by explaining it to him. (It's like Memento, but with a sense of humor and charm, and minus the sociopaths). So if you hate wondering what's going when you watch a film, then you might not like this one. Just so you know, when my sweetie finally &#34;got&#34; it he liked it, but if I could go back in time, I would have saved him two hours of his life by NOT subjecting him to this film. If you like Charlie Kauffman and Michel Gondry (as I do), then you will most likely like this film as much as I did, the first time I saw it.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Really good with great potential.  It had a slow start and the development of Watson was a bit on the dry side.  Granted, they were trying to cover quite a bit.  Look forward to more.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Can't get enough of this game, and with the addition of rooms it never gets old or boring to me
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Who does not love this book? It opened up a whole new world! Can't wait for the movie! Best book ever!
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I have been a big fan of The Eagles since the high School: their music, the way the assembled notes, chords and harmonies.  if you pay attention to the words in every song they have, you´ll realize a message valid on those days of the 70´s, untill now.  They split up in July 1980 when I started Med School (those were bad news),  and when they regroup themselves in 1994 was the best news I had on that time.  Now that I am older, You begin to question yourself: why did they split in 1980? Was it because of money? they became greedy? Why the conflict between Glenn with Don Felder? why Randy didn´t showup one day and Timothy appeared on scene? How Joe entered in the Eagles? problems with the strong personality of Bernie Leadon? roll of Irvin Azoff in the process and a lot of questions that this video reveals.  I prefered Bluray edition because of video quality though they are of the 70´s and further, but if you want, i am sure DVD edition has to be pretty much the same.  I really advise to buy this product.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Viewed once on &#34;HBO&#34;. It then disppeared for national viewing. I really liked when they showed how CHANEY the Vice Pres., used his power and contacts to help his Company Haliburton and other greedy oil industry related companies raped billions at our expense. How would you like them Fracking in your back yard? Without your approval or consent, then say everything is just fine with your water. Would you like to live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area with 50,000 wells around? This a must see.<br />A good book to read that DEBUNKS Al Gore's Climate warning which is another Government ploy to help their greedy backers.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't see what all the complaints are. This book was awesome!! I love the fact that Sylvia is building the characters, makes it more real life. READ THIS BOOK. It will not disappoint.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has all the mini games you could ever ask for plus you get 250000 if you review this app
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever. It is worth paying $7 for it.You can get your nether reactor core back by mining it and the Obsidian with a diamond pic.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I just love the Die Hard formula.  Bruce Willis offers a tight performance and Jai Courtney was great too. More please!!!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was soo excited for the release of this book, only to be extremely disappointed! A trilogy means 3 not 4, not 5 WTH! This book was extremely hard for me to read due to the fact that is seemed to drag. And the ending was HORRIBLE!! How can Sylvia Day leave us hanging yet again and how long til the next book is released!! I for one may not purchase the next book unless she is quick to release it! So let down by this author that I will more than likely not read any other books published by her.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am in shock that people are so angry this didn't wrap the series! I am freaking ecstatic!! Give me more Gideon and Eva anyway!! This was the best in the series and I am thrilled they are 2 more books coming! Thank you Sylvia for another great book!!

159463176X|4.0|Khaled Hosseini has this uncanny ability to weave a web of sentimentality around his characters.  In simple sentences, he has the power to convey a lot more than one can imagine.  The Afghan background adds a mystique touch to the characters, maybe, because we know so little about the war-torn place in spite of the fact that there is so much coverage of the place.  The characters are so intertwined to one another that their day to day activities create a hard hitting impact in you.<br /><br />His previous books, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns are based on the Afghan setting.  That's where the similarity ends.  Khaled Hosseini's strong points have always been about creating strong characters.  This one is no different in that aspect.  It is the ability to maneuver your characters beautifully is what makes this book a riveting read.  He is a master storyteller who weaves complex relationships between characters, and their lives that appear divergent and have no commonalities, converge as if that's what you expected all along.<br /><br />It is definitely a recommended read.  But then, after the master class of The Kite Runner, one would always feel that this book falls short of expectations.
B00A81MV3U|3.0|I don't know what I expected, due to the fact I knew nothing about the story line, but movies like this are downers for me and a waste of time. I didn't think it deserved any awards, but that kind of crap is what Hollywood puts out today. Sad.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Why dont you update Minecraft to 0.7.0 version? I want to spawn things. Its getting so boring not getting any updates for things.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The series just get's bettter and better. I hope it continues for a couple more years. I've enjoyed each and every Dexter series.

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno is far more entertaining than Justin Bieber and much more diverse in songs and over all entertainment. I will buy anything Bruno puts out. Never disappoints. Sorry about the death of his Mother.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie was well done and the actors were remarkable.  It showed in graphic detail some of the situations that Wardens, Guards and prisoners find themselves in.  It shows how our Court system can make mistakes and how they try to rectify them.  Best for adult audiences.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|This was a real sweet feel good movie for most ages and one most of us can relate to. W e need more gentle, thought provoking movies like this.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I found this book to be exactly what the title says. It was simple and straight to the point. I've just finished but I feel that I'll be able to use what I've learned in this book in my daily life. I recommend this book.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Another great cd from Lady Antebellum. I enjoyed every piece of music and highly reccommend it to everyone. I have all their cds. Never get tired of them.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|The sound effects are funny and make the game more enjoyable. The challenges are not too hard or too easy. I can play this game and so can my 7 year old son.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Excellent as only Michael Buble music can and always will be. Enjoyed all the songs. Would keep ordering Michaels cds.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My 7 year old son and I love playing this game. It is exciting to expand the park and grow our dinosaurs bigger.
0316247545|5.0|Absolutely stunning!<br /><br />I will proudly prop this in my display case.  The cover is elegant and high-quality.  Additionally, the content is cram-packed with useful and insightful information on the show.  It covers exclusive interviews to adorable artwork.<br /><br />I'm definitely planning to buy another.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|I like the game but. I wish It wasn't just one thing. Instead of just thinking of a character you could have choices like a game or Tv show. I still like the game so by it but I am just saying I'd like some options.
1451695195|4.0|Another example of a medical person relating their experience of dying and then returning to life.<br />The only part that I found a bit hard was understanding all the technical medical words.<br />However at the end Dr Eben Alexander completely refutes the general medical 'belief' that what happened to him was an impossibility. So on that it was good to hear truth.
B0000A5BU3|3.0|I understand why this was largely ignored by the market. Despite the horns and riffs that were reminiscent of the previous Niles Rogers-David Bowie collaboration, this was not &#34;Let's Dance&#34; part two.<br />Still the music is lush, Bowie is restrained, and the album grows on you.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this app is useful,  easy to use,  fun to use,  and designed well. best free app I've got. I love the layering of sounds and simple design.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This movie has been played so many times, I've nearly lost count!  My 3 year old LOVES this movie. The story line is cute and the animation is even cuter!
B003QSPTAY|5.0|Great family movie to watch with all ages. Awesome to rent it on the spot and watch it while visiting friends.
B009R659L8|5.0|A wonderful experience. Once again Mary Higgins Clark keeps the reader guessing until the end and wanting more love her.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Still watching, but so far it is as I expected, great.  I have purchased so far 1 - 7 waiting to purchase season 8, but it is too expensive.  So I will wait until its in my price range.  So far though I am not disappointed.
B004RKXW0E|5.0|As with some other Disney Pixar movies (most notibly Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo) this movie is right up there as one of the best family movies you can watch. Great story and very nice picture and sound quality. It's also quite humorous, even for adults. I highly recommend it as well as the other Toy Story movies.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I have 1 - 5 and so buying 6 was a easy choice.  Its was a smart buy as I love the show and get to watch again and again.  I can recommend to anyone if you love the series purchase the DVDs it worth it.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|So cute  daughter loves it plays all the time greatest babysitter don't run out of choices it's clear and with no hick ups or frezzers
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a great game but we're is the update for kindle fire HD me and my friend who has an iPod  play online together all the time and he has the update
0425263924|4.0|I love the sweet and funny moments between Eva and Gideon. I love seeing their relationship work it's way to being secure and solid. I love Gideon's growth due to Eva. However, I think the repeat descriptions of things, such as Gideon's office (previously described in books 1 and 2) seemed redundant. In addition, some of the secondary characters, such as Megumi, and their related plots we're unnecessary, making the story a bit scattered. Brett and Corrine need to be wrapped up and shelved, same thing can be said for the Lucas couple and the case on Nathan. Keep Cary, but get rid of Tat. It should focus on Gideon and Eva and their journey to become a healthy and strong couple and individuals. There doesn't need to be additional drama thrown at them (such as the Golden video) for story filler, considering all that they've been through. If the next two books can do that, the integrity of the writing and story will be maintained.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Well written. Informative and a swift read. I don't have much time for reading these days, but I read this within a few lunch breaks. Inspirational, & hard to put down. Looking forward to reading more by this author!

B0098460O4|5.0|These are two very talented people. What is so surprising is their ages. They are so exceptional at this age, will be be following them.
B000NHG7BQ|5.0|It is a good movie some parts were missing out of the movie. But it was still good. I won't buy a directors cut again {now that I know what it means}. Like when nacho was talking to Kevin in Spanish and the other guy said he has never talked that much and that's my cousin. That part was out.
0425263908|4.0|\\"I can't go long without you either, Eva. You're an addiction...my obsession...\\"<br /><br />Yes, I know I am late coming to this party. What can I say? I thought there were going to be three books, so I held off until closer to the release of Entwined With You before I started. Then it was announced that there will actually be five books, so I decided to go ahead and start them... I really couldn't wait any longer. I have been dying to find out what all the fuss with Gideon Cross is about.<br /><br />\\"I can let you in, Eva. I'm trying. But your first response when I screw up is to run away. You do it every time and I can't stand feeling like any moment I'm going to do or say something wrong and you're going to bolt.\\"<br /><br />I want to start off with what I didn't like about Bared to You, this way I can end the review on a positive and not with me moaning. What didn't I like? Eva Tramell. Plain and simple, I can't stand her. I used to think that the most annoying female narrator was Ana from FSoG. Let me just say right now, you will never hear me say another bad word about Ana, she and I are officially BFFs.<br /><br />I actually lost count at the number of times I rolled my eyes, yelled at my Kindle, updated Goodreads with a snotty comment about her, or had to physically put my Kindle down to calm myself. Eva is the queen of bad decision making. I can maybe count on one hand the number of times I actually agreed with an important decision she made. Honestly, I wanted to throat punch her. She starts fights for absolutely no reason, she is petty, and quite frankly vindictive. You hurt her precious little feelings, she will do what she can to doubly hurt yours. Ugh.<br /><br />\\"He was the kind of guy that made a woman want to rip his shirt open and watch the buttons scatter along with her inhibitions.\\"<br /><br />*whew* I'm glad to have that out of my system. Now, what did I love about Bared to You? Do you even need to ask? That would be the one and only, Gideon Cross. Holy bejesus, he is one fine man. I had little doubt going in that I wasn't going to like him. I love the confident, arrogant, dominate male characters... and Gideon Cross is the King of them all. But it is not just his dominance... he is so very sweet. And some of the things he says will make you weak in the knees. We are talking some MAJOR swoon moments from Mr. Cross.<br /><br />\\"I've always seen you, angel. From the moment you found me, I've seen nothing but you.\\"<br /><br />I don't want to compare Bared to You to other well known erotic romances, but I must say the sex scenes here are far superior. The wording used changes quite often, so you don't really get bored with them. I never got the feeling of same 'ole same ole'. Each and every interaction between these two is hot, and honestly off the charts. There is no denying their sexual attraction, that's for sure.<br /><br />\\"It's probably best for me to work off some energy before I get you naked. I'm sure you'd like to be able to walk tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />I am not going to go on and on about the reasons you should read this book, because frankly I'm sure those that want to already have. You either love these type of books or you don't. I'm just sorry if you are in the 'don't want to read them' category, cause you are so missing out on Gideon Cross.<br /><br />I am excited to carry on with the series, Reflected in You being the next book. I just hope that Eva grows up a little so that I can actually start to like her, instead of dreaming up ways to kill her.<br /><br />\\"Oh, Eva.\\" He rubbed his cheek against my damp face. \\"I must've wished for you so hard and so often you had no choice but to come true.\\"<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readsss.

0486290492|1.0|I love this novel and had it couple of years back (from a better publisher of course!). Because of moving several times i misplaced it and after many years i wanted to read it again (Yes its an awesome book). But when i got this one from amazon i was very disappointed. There are so many errors in a single page that it kills the joy of reading a Jane Austin novel. Really disappointed!!!
0425263924|5.0|\\"If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined.\\"<br /><br />Wow. Now this was more like it. I can not even begin to explain how much I absolutely loved this instalment. It was by far my favorite of the series.<br /><br />\\"Angel, a crowd of millions couldn't hide you from me. I found you once. I'll always find you.\\"<br /><br />You remember my reviews for Bared to You and Reflected in You? Remember my hatred for Eva? Well, we are still not BFFs but I think we are well and truly on our way to some form of a friendship. Don't get me wrong, she still made some pretty stupid mistakes, and there were moments I still wanted to slap her. But going from plotting a way to murder a fictional character, to only wanting to slap her a few times? This is major progress, my friends.<br /><br />\\"There wasn't a second that passed when you weren't on my mind. You own me, Eva. Wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, I belong to you.\\"<br /><br />I simply loved Gideon in Entwined with You, I mean of course I loved him before but I feel it is he that has helped Eva grow up so much. When she would start one of her little hissy fits, or when she is trying to pick a fight from nothing, he would stop her. He would ask her to explain her feelings so that they could figure out what set her off. This meant they were able to communicate, and lets be honest, that has always been their major issue. They can have sex, that's for sure... but to sit down and talk? I really felt they made some major strides in their relationship here.<br /><br />\\"Honestly, Gideon Cross had been designed to f*** a woman right out of her mind.\\"<br /><br />And holy cow are the sex scenes H.O.T. We all know that Gideon and Eva has had more sex in the last six months than most people have a in a year, if not more. And they have always been able to keep things interesting. Well, there is no change now. These are some of the hottest scenes I have ever read.<br /><br />Now, before I get up on my soapbox, I want to quickly add that there is no relationship cliffhanger in Entwined with You. Gideon and Eva are actually in a great place, so there is nothing to worry about there. I felt the ending to be in a location, and I am sure book four will be picking up exactly where this one left off.<br /><br />\\"Gideon was an untamed animal behind closed doors, a lover who bared me to the soul every time he made love to me.\\"<br /><br />Okay, on to the controversy surrounding this series. The Crossfire series was originally planned as a trilogy. However, not too long ago, Sylvia Day announced that it was now going to be a five book series. There was a lot of rumbling, but it wasn't until Entwined with You released that the crap hit the fan.<br /><br />There are 1 star reviews coming in left, right and center. Most simply complaining that the series is no longer a trilogy, it is a money making scheme, yadda, yadda, yadda. I just want to throw my two cents in, because hey, this is my review and I get to say what I want.<br /><br />Why are people so rude? Most of these reviews are flat out attacks on the author, and I do not agree with cyber bullying. Everybody is entitled to their opinion, but a review left for a product should do just that... review the product. Read the book, review the book. If you didn't like the book, fair enough. Attacking the author because you don't want five books? Why don't you just not read the rest of the books then? Simple. And how exactly is this a money making scheme? If this series would have ended at three books, and she got picked up for another series. Do we not think that everybody would be reading that series also? Of course they would. I don't see how extending a series would make any more money than by starting a new series, that everybody would still read because of her being the author.<br /><br />Let's be honest here, there is not a huge time span crossed in this series. Have Eva and Gideon even been together six months by the end of this book? There are so many emotional scars between the pair of them, not to mention all of the external mess they are dealing with... I think I would have been more upset if it had only been three books. It would have been completely unrealistic to have it all wrapped up with a pretty bow in that short of a time period.<br /><br />And I never felt the story in Entwined with You drag, I felt everything was progressing nicely. I'll say it again... this was the best in the series in my opinion, by far. There was actually growth and movement forward. So if the next two books in the Crossfire series are this well written, I can easily say I can't wait for them. It was Gideon alone that made me want to continue after I read Bared to You, now it is the series as a whole that I am excited about reading.<br /><br />\\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly. I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you. I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry. I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life. I want to wake up to you like this every day forever. I want you.\\"<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readsook?

0425263916|4.0|*takes calming breath* I have never been so mentally and physically exhausted after reading a book. I have used the term roller coaster in the past with other reviews, but that just goes to show I had no idea what I was talking about back then. This. Book. Will. Exhaust. You.<br /><br />\\"I'd rather argue with you, angel, then laugh with anyone else.\\"<br /><br />Reflected in You, starts off exactly where Bared to You ended. We find Eva and Gideon desperately trying to find an even level footing in their relationship. But, not only do they have both of their pasts to get over, they also have every possible outside force coming at them full steam ahead. Every time they had a calm moment, everything seems peaceful and you start to think that this could be it... maybe things will calm down. BAM! Something else gets thrown at them.<br /><br />\\"You're the greatest risk I've ever taken.\\" His pressed his lips gently to mine. \\"And the greatest reward.\\"<br /><br />If you read my review for Bared to You then you will know that I am not Eva's biggest fan, unfortunately that really hasn't changed. She has continued to make some of the stupidest decisions I have ever seen. Her insecurity and hypocrisy truly knows no bounds. However, she did make me chuckle a few times. Eva has a thing where she flips people the bird when she doesn't have a smooth comeback. This honestly made me laugh out loud several times. I actually liked seeing a fun side of Eva.<br /><br />\\"I flipped the good doctor the bird.<br />Snorting, Gideon caught my hand and pulled me back down the hall.<br />\\"What is it with you and giving people the finger?\\"<br />\\"What? It's a classic.\\"<br /><br />Gideon as always is the star of the show for me. He is the reason I love these books. He is also a saint for putting up with Eva. However, there were a couple of times that I wanted to yell at him this go around. But in the end his grand plan all came together, and I understood why he was acting the way he was. He is as always, sex on legs. There is no other way to describe this man, he is the ultimate.<br /><br />\\"His kisses were gifts. He kissed with everything he had, with power and passion and hunger and love. He held nothing back, giving everything, exposing everything.\\"<br /><br />The sex is well and truly on fire in Reflected in You. Even with the constant up and down roller coaster ride of emotions, you can always count on Gideon and Eva to have good sex. That will never change. There is also true emotion, I mean how could there not be between these two? Everything is amped to the highest degree with them.<br /><br />\\"Are you hurting anywhere else?\\" I asked, feeling so emotionally raw after the long night we'd had.<br /><br />He caught my wrist and pulled my hand down to press flat over his heart. \\"Here.\\"<br /><br />So, I am now ready to tackle the third book in the Crossfire series, Entwined With You. I will again end this review with a prayer that Eva grows up. Granted, I didn't find myself wanting to kill her quite as often as I did in Bared to You, but I can easily say we are still not BFFs.<br /><br />\\"I'll kill for you, give up everything I own for you... but I won't give you up.\\"<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readsays, sex on legs.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another winning contemporary love story from Sylvia Day, Entwined with You tells the continuing story of Eva Tramell, a 24 year old ad agency assistant, and Gideon Cross, the multibillionaire head of Cross Industries.  Their troubled pasts and insecurities keep invading their attempts at happiness.  Does true love triumph?  I can't wait for the next installment!

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Got this as Amazon's FAOTD on 6/6/13. Had a hunch (based on previous successful install of a Zeptolab app) that this would run on android-x86, and it DID!  Looking forward to their other titles.
B00992CF6W|5.0|0.7.0 is finally out.(for apple devices only) it should be about 1 or 2 weeks now but it doesn't add redstone.
B004P8ITGU|3.0|The premise behind this book really is quite clever.  Two highly successful lawyers marry, have a child, and surprise, surprise - the offspring decides he wants to be a lawyer when he grows up!  A nice, realistic portrayal of life in a legal household.  The good thing about young Master Boone is that he is a very likeable character, both within the confines of the story, and beyond.  Readers will like him because of his relative modesty, his insecurities, his faults and his talents.  His fellow characters (school friends)  like him because he is cool as.<br /><br />His parents, too, are far from perfect, as is the highlight (for me) of the book - Uncle Ike.  That dude has SERIOUS ISSUES but we love him just the same.<br /><br />This book is FUN!  Even though it is obviously aimed at the younger (teen?) reader, THEODORE BOON is a great introduction to the legal thriller as well as a way of making enquiring young minds think of life after the school years end.  John Grisham's writing style has always been an easy one to pick up; he writes in the common, down to earth way that makes his books a joy to read.  This concept is extrapolated for the younger market and it works a treat in this book.<br /><br />Negatively speaking, I think the plot itself is the weak link in this story.  Basing the complete book around a murder trial is normally a safe bet, but this case is a little feeble, and a boring one at that. There are, however, hints of suspense scattered throughout the story whenever Theo comes up against Omar Cheepe and I imagine he will have a role to play as we approach the end of the book.<br /><br />I give this book three stars, but in actuality (your Honour) it is more like three and a half.<br /><br />BFN Greggorio!
B003JH8LPW|3.0|I just finished this and I would say it was a good read. The story moved well and the ending was interesting. Of course it saddens me to see a story where someone throws their entire life away, endangers the country, all over the perceived and hope of a love relationship with a women who's intrests lie elsewhere. I will keep it on the virtual shelf and re-read it over a rainy day or two. You could do far worse.<br /><br />Of course with any work of fiction, this has just enough of a grain of truth to make it interesting. Especially with the current headlines about how the NSA is gathering information on every single phone call made via a certain cell company. As if it would be just one.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After loving Bared to you and Reflected in you I am sad to write that I thought this book was terrible!!!!  Although there is a small amount of plot development (and a ton of sex scenes which actually get redundant), I agree with the other reviewers that you are left feeling like SD just wrote this book because she saw dollar signs.  There are a great many elements that are left unfinished/unresolved when the book ends.  In fact to call it an ending is misleading, it is more like the book just stops.  I will read the other installments only because I love Gideon but I'll probably figure out a way to borrow the book instead of buying it as SD has really let me down with this one. REALLY DISAPPOINTING installment to this series.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so excited for this book. I couldn't wait for it to come out. I just finished reading it and I can't even describe how pissed and disappointed I am. After reading the first 2 in the series (more than once, like many) I had high expectations considering it was supposed to be a trilogy but then I heard that Miss Day is going for 5 with this series. Initially I was stoked because I thought it meant we would get more of their lives after the &#34;geez, i've been dumb i love you so much let's get married&#34; moment but I guess that is not to be. This part of the story just flowed so strangely and there were some contradictions from the first 2 books, mainly in the Brett arena. There's a lot of things that Eva does, says, inner monologue, etc. that just don't seem the same as the Eva we know. Megumi's story seems contrived and quite frankly is unnecessary with all of Gideon and Eva's drama. It seems like Miss Day is setting up for some spin offs but I resent it getting in the way of G&E's story.  I won't do the spoiler thing but I did get a little lost in their time in the Carribean. It was such a funny/happy thing. In all reality, I will end up reading #4 and #5 but I will find it somewhere for free. I feel jipped!

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|The first QOTSA recording I purchased was Songs for the Deaf. After that, I wanted to see why Dave Grohl was into these guys and I bought most of their CDs, including an Eagles of Death Metal that Josh collaborated with. Come to find out, I missed out on some really great rock music, but I'm all caught up now. Actually one of the songs on this new cd ....Like Clockwork had the same vibe as EODM. I really enjoy listening to Josh's haunting machine gun but melodic guitar playing on his past records. This new one hangs with the best of them. I'm not going to break down every song(I'm sure someone else will) because I've only given it a couple spins. If you're a fan of Queens of the Stone Age then you must add this to your collection. I can tell already this is going to be on my play list for a while. Get it!!

B007REV4T8|5.0|James Bond, for many of us, has been an amazing run that began with fifteen novels by Ian Fleming and today represents a fifty-year old film series with twenty-three official films.<br /><br />History tells us fans that the beginning of each adventure will set the stage and mood of the tale.  Skyfall continues this tradition in a grand scale when 007 has a mission go wrong in Istanbul.  The carnage to elements of transportation and people prior to the opening credits is amazing.<br /><br />Skyfall has been long awaited – being held hostage by MGM's financial problems.  The wait was worth it as Daniel Craig (007), Judi Dench (M), and Javier Bardem (the bad guy) deliver a believable threat to the MI-6 of the twenty-first century.<br /><br />Internationally set, this cast and crew racked up quite a few air miles with filming in Turkey, China, Japan, London, and Scotland.  Even though it is the second longest Bond film (143 minutes running time), Skyfall never bogged down and rarely allowed us to catch our breath.  It feels like it belongs with the great and classic Bond flicks:  exciting, personal, intense, and beautifully made.  It had everything I needed to satisfy my appetite for more 007.

B009OYTIXS|1.0|Can't say much about the show since I can't watch the show I paid for.  They don't tell you that you can't download to a mac until after you pay for it.  I am deployed overseas now and the internet here is hit or miss so I will just have to stream it little bits at a time.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|An amazing game with such an addicting gameplay, I love it! I would give this game a 5 of 5 stars any day!
B004PZ4HC8|2.0|Before I started reading this book, I had very high hopes. The trailer to the movie looks fantastic and I really enjoy zombie and horror stories. Because of this, I thought that I would like the book and thought that it would be very interesting. However, upon finishing the book, I was very unsatisfied. I felt that the story had the potential to be much more engaging and interesting. Many of the interviews were just stories of how they personally dealt with the herd of zombies rather than the actual zombie invasion. In addition, I felt many of the interviews were boring and did not allow me to have any emotions towards the story. Do not get me wrong, some of the interviews were thrilling and exciting and I really enjoyed those. I just felt there were not enough of those to make me suggest this book to somebody else. I would suggest reading one or two of the interviews in the story before diving into it. The title and preface are really deceiving. All in all, I found this book as a bit of a disappointment. I did not enjoy reading it and would not suggest it to a friend. However, this book was not what I expected and people who love zombies may thoroughly enjoy the story.

0684857219|5.0|If you are like me and are interested in getting into the sport of bodybuilding then this is the book for you. I enjoy reading and I always felt that if you read what you were interested in doing your mind would be focused on it. I go through this book everyday and I am constantly learning new things. It is not a bad read either. With the amount of information you are provided with you will be reading and reading.
B0090EJR1K|2.0|Borat was like Impractical Jokers in the sense that nobody knew it was a movie except the team behind the character, Borat.  Then, The Dictator came along and I wanted to see it mainly because Borat was so good.  Dictator was funny, but it lacked that documentary style humor that made me love Borat.  For a free movie, it was great entertainment, but I do not think I would want to own this one.  Perhaps the unrated version is better?
030746363X|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I did what the book says and only read the parts you need. I went cover to cover and didn't want to skip a section. It gave me insight and tips on how to keep the fat at a minimum when binging on cheat days and I still use that advice!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|The \\"Sword of Truth\\" books are awesome.  This show is \\"based on\\" those books but not quite a full conversion of the original plot.  There is a difference between \\"based on\\" and \\"the story of\\", okay?  I mean, \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" isn't even the same title, so we probably shouldn't expect an exact replica of the book plot.<br /><br />I read the first book before the series, watched the series on Netflix, and finally read the second book.  There are other books in the series, too, but eh, I haven't got that far.  All I know is that I like the books a lot more than the show, yet I like the show a lot.<br /><br />Legend of the Seeker is a brilliant television series.  Yes, I said it.  You can disagree all you like, but I liked Xena and Hercules a while ago, as well.  This show is entertaining.  It has a humorous undertone, it gives me a fantastic cast of characters, and it has a nice hook: a magic sword-wielding adventurer who knows nothing of the fantasy world.  It's basically a new D&D show!  Ha.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are looking for a fantasy adventure with a decent (but not perfect) plot and a nice cast, you should watch this show.  I give it 5/5 stars just because I disagree with all the people giving the show 1/5 stars for not being like the book.  I mean, if you can give it 1/5 stars for being different from what you expected,  I can give it 5/5 stars for being entertaining and one of the best shows in its genre to date.  I am a fan of the books, but the show is also good in its own way.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a fantastic sci-fi series, published at a great price. The storyline is gripping and very well developed. I couldn't put this book down and am looking forward to reading everything else Hugh Howey has ever written. He is definitely going on my list of authors to buy from. Read his work. You will not be sorry.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Escape is really fun! My son and I enjoyed trying to solve the levels together. Can't wait for more levels to be available!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I've been waiting a while for this book to be released and I'm sad to say it was not worth my patience. The story was rushed. It became repetitive with the same love scenes and words. It left me hanging. Too many scenarios where introduced but none where completely resolved or explained or discussed. The end was lame and I am not sure what to expect for the next book. What angle will be take to all the twists that derived in this book. Confusing.

B003VWU2WA|5.0|I bought this to use as a button for a DIY photo booth I was making. It worked great and looked great. I have since used it for other purposes like editing in adobe premier using it to scrub through the time line and the cut.  I also use it when reading manga online having set the rotate to scrolling and the press to click right.<br /><br />One problem it that the usb cord is short so you may want a usb extender.
0062220837|4.0|Stardust is a beautifully written fairy tale with all of the classic fairy tale elements - witches, fairies, unicorns, magic, a thrilling adventure, and star-crossed lovers. Neil Gaiman doesn't just write novels, he creates worlds filled with lovable characters. In Stardust, young, idealistic, romantic Tristan gets the most beautiful girl in town to promise to marry him if he brings her a fallen star. To win her hand, he enters the forbidden land of fairies and finds several others are on the same quest, and they will do anything necessary to find the star first. Tristan, a farm boy, is not even a little bit prepared for battles with warriors and demons and magic. Luckily, Tristan's earnestness and trustworthiness is rewarded with help from a couple of the magical creatures he meets on his journey.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book is so good, it keeps you reading and when you think all is well, it is really not. It forces you to question what is real or not, and explains each choice the character makes. Well written.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Its amazing but I cant level up past level 18. that's the only thing I do not like about it
030758836X|5.0|This book is amazing!!!<br />I'm a romance novel freak. This book is so different. What makes this book the best is the unexpected twists and turns it takes. The best part is the ending. I kept guessing the ending and totally did not expect it to end this way. Simply amazing. A brilliant book. This is not your typical love story.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender's Game really blew me away. I would classify it as: if you haven't read it, go for it immediately. (SPOILER) I was most shaken by the notion of the \\"bugger\\" one mind, and the guilt it felt in its final thought. I also couldn't help but notice that a lot of subsequent young adult genre stories are derivatives of Ender's Game---but then maybe Card didn't get there first himself? Either way a fun read.
B00BC55S7M|5.0|I simply love it. Great performance!!! Iced Earth always delivers!! No need to say much. A must have item to add to collection!!!!
B000FBJAOG|4.0|I challenge anyone to find a greater mock-guide on anything! The tone remains hilariously serious, and the approach is absurdly logical.

B000SEHJGQ|4.0|There is something strangely endearing about Bukowski's autobiographical telling. He has a way of getting the core of characters and cutting through seven layers of their own veneer in the blink of an eye.
0425263924|2.0|I have waited so long for this 3rd book and must say it is not as good as books 1 & 2. Although you do see the character development in Gideon, Eva is wimpy and wants to make everyone happy at the expense of the man who loves her. And she goes from highs to lows in an instant - unstable???I don't mind reading about Cary and all the screw ups that he has, but what was the Corrine over dose about??? It was dropped. I do not care about why Megurmi is missing or her story - unless you want to develop a book totally about her. Then when you get to the end with no closure only to discover there will be at least 1 more book (I have heard there will be 2 more) I was not happy. The story line was crazy and jumped from situation to situation - it was hard to follow. I agree with others that the author is trying to pull in the bucks. Very disappointing. Not sure if I'll purchase those books. Plus- the price of it is high considering other trilogies.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I do love A Song of Ice and Fire, but I can't help but feel like George RR is pulling us around at this point! Ultimately I just have a love/hate relationship with the books, but lean more toward love.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Rush has been my greatest soarce for musical entertainment for 20+ years. If you apreciate this legendary rock band, you have to see this documentary.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I classify myself as an introvert, and man do I agree with Susan Cain's assertion that we live in a world that values the charismatic extrovert over the quiet thoughtful type. I think Quiet brings up a very valid point of discussion, especially when paralleled with the ever increasing presence of social media and the expectations many feel to have a loud voice on Twitter, blogs, Facebook ad nauseum. It is a very relevant book.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|One day it just forgot all my words. I don't know how or why. I am Disappointed in this app. It's supposed to be the best thing.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have to note that Hunger Games is aimed at a teen audience and not a cynical twenty-something. That being said, it has to be stated that Hunger Games could be more than it is.<br />Look. I like it. There was action. There were despots. There was archery. However, at all times throughout the book it seems as though Suzanne Collins is actively shying away from lifting the scope of the narrative. She focuses on little things instead of truly embracing the vision of the dystopian future that she created. I wanted more on President Snow. I wanted more backstory on the Districts. I wanted more on the power structure of the nation. I don't want them in sequels, I wanted them on page 50(not literally that page, just illustrating a point)!<br />Though I liked the book, I have to say that ultimately my judgment is this: Hunger Games is last year's commercially successful novel that could have been a timeless classic of young adult fiction.
B0019IB0II|5.0|My husband just had a stroke, and one of his therapists recommended this book.  What a wonderful resource, and a great comfort.  Dr. Taylor has a way of writing that draws you in, is not too technical (but technical enough), gives an incredible insight into what happens during this devastating time.  Thank you!!
B005DC68NI|5.0|Extremely cogent and extremely informative. I put down Let's Get Digital and felt like I knew a lot more about self publishing and the industry as a whole.

B001BC5HXG|4.0|The storyline is a staple mash of strained family relationships and so on, but its littered intermittently with remarkable commentary and philosophical perspectives. Its a long read, but worth it.
0425263924|5.0|Entwined With You was everything I could have wanted! I was thrilled with the story, happy with the ending and now am excited for the next books!<br /><br />This review is spoiler-free.<br /><br />Since this is book #3 in the series, I am not going to talk about the plot at all here. This book is not a standalone and should only be read after both Bared To You and Reflected In You.<br /><br />First you can all rest easy because there is NO RELATIONSHIP CLIFFHANGER!!! In fact, of all the three books so far, I'd say this one had the most resolved ending of all. It ended at a point where Gideon and Eva were together and happy. Yes, there were still many unanswered questions for future books (mostly regarding external plot lines and milestones that Gideon and Eva still have to cross) but there was no relationship cliffhanger!<br /><br />There was also real no stupidity and no cheating throughout the book. Yes, the characters made mistakes, but they're only human. I `understood' everything that both Gideon and Eva did throughout the book. I understood why they messed up and I respected them for trying to fix their mistakes.<br /><br />There was a lot of smokin' hot sex (and I mean H.O.T.) but it didn't overpower the actual work they put into the relationship. I loved that they didn't use sex as a distraction for working out their issues. They'd always had intense chemistry and sexual attraction but they were also actively focused just as much on working on the rest of their relationship as well which made them functional as a couple both inside and outside of the bedroom.<br /><br />I loved that they had this intensely passionate, tumultuous relationship but at the core of it all was always their strong, unwavering love for each other. Everything else was just details.<br /><br />Entwined With You started off right where book #2 ended throwing us right back in the story. If it has been a while since you've read the last book, I would recommend re-reading at least the last chapter of book #2 before starting this just to get yourself back into the details of the story.<br /><br />In this book, Gideon and Eva's journey continues as they fight their inner demons and nightmares and work together at maintaining and building a functional relationship filled with intense desire, love and commitment.<br /><br />\\"You own me, Eva. Wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, I belong to you.\\"<br /><br />One of my most favorite things about Gideon and Eva as a couple is that they TALK!!! They talk through EVERYTHING! They've both been broken by their pasts and are dealing with untold amounts of external stress and yet with them, their relationship always came first. I always knew what their top priority was. I could just feel it. And I absolutely freaking LOVED it.<br /><br />\\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly. I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you. I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry. I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life. I want to wake up to you like this every day forever. I want you.\\"<br /><br />Gideon Cross is the ultimate tortured, Alpha hero. He's completely dominant and possessive but at the same time so vulnerable and broken.  Truthfully, protective and possessive doesn't even begin to describe him though. He's also loyal, understanding, powerful, and passionate. He is just the perfect balance of everything in my eyes. He is Alpha enough to make me swoon but was always logical and rational in his actions. I absolutely loved that he always put Eva first. He was always thinking of her and it was clear in each one of his actions. If it's possible, I love him even more after reading this book than I did before starting!<br /><br />I've always really loved Eva too. Deeply scarred by her past and also still hurt by things that had happened in their relationship (despite it being a missunderstanding), she had to work hard to keep being open. Luckily, Gideon helped balance her out.He was always insisting on working things through together. And at the end of the day, they both just wanted to make things work, and were willing to do anything to bring them closer to each other.<br /><br />I loved that they went toe to toe on everything. Yes, Gideon was powerful and dominating but Eva was also strong and independent. They didn't clash, but rather they complimented each other. Their relationship was always balanced and I could never doubted the value they placed on their relationship. You could feel that they were willing to sacrifice anything for each other and never give up. I just loved it. It was heart warming to an extreme.<br /><br />\\"Despite everything, we were stronger than we'd ever been.\\"<br /><br />And the HEAT!!!! ohhhhh the intensity!! This has got to be one of the hottest books I've ever read! Not that it was literally the most graphic but just that their connection intensified every sexual encounter between them. It was scorching!! Sizzling! And, I'm not going to lie, they certainly took things further in the bedroom than they'd ever gone before. There was definitely an \\"oh my!!\\" moment for me at one point<br /><br />But like I said, I loved that with them it was never all about the sex. I loved watching them genuinely, step-by-step work through their issues. I loved being able to see their progress and to see them grow both as individuals and as a couple.<br /><br />The build up of the book's ending wasn't as intense as the last one to be sure but that was totally okay with me. Given the context of the story, it didn't feel right to have something super intense in that moment and I'm glad the author didn't put some random drama there just for the sake of sensationalizing it. I respect her for staying true to the characters.<br /><br />The ending left us in a good place. My heart is happy and I couldn't have asked for a better place to pause their story while we wait for the rest of the series to be released.<br /><br />It has been confirmed that there will be 2 more books in the series after this one. The Crossfire series will now have 5 books.<br /><br />I have loved this series from the start and if the next two books are going to continue Gideon and Eva's story following the same path that these first 3 books have taken and just continue to develop their relationship together without stupidity or excess drama, then I'm all for it!!!<br /><br />At first, I thought I would have wanted the \\"happily ever after\\" we would have gotten had this been the final book but I can honestly tell you that I did NOT feel that any of the issues were dragged out, or just \\"put there\\" for the sake of creating more text. There was no \\"drama for drama's sake\\" and everything that happened both made sense, kept me engaged (or fanning myself) and was believable for the characters.<br /><br />Also, given the amount of issues they still have to work through (which I won't name in order to keep this spoiler-free), I'm honestly very happy that they're getting more books. I think their story could easily take two more books to tell it in and there are still so many things that I personally WANT to see them work through that we would never have been able to see if the story had wrapped up in just this one book.<br /><br />I know some people said that the ending left them \\"desperately wanting more\\", and while I respect their opinion, I just don't get it to be honest. The story HAD to end somewhere and since we know there will be more books I was completely happy with the ending. Yes, in the issues external to the relationship, there are still unanswered questions but, if there weren't any, then how would we ever have more books??<br /><br />Gideon and Eva were happy and together at the end. For the ending of a mid-series book, I couldn't have asked for anything better.<br /><br />Personally, I loved it. Totally loved it. Gideon and Eva continue to be one of my absolute, all time favorite book couples and I can't wait for more of their story!<br /><br />Basically, if you loved the first two books, you should absolutely read this!!<br /><br />❤<br /><br />As a final note, I just want to share this with you. It's a message from the author that I really love and tells me all that I need to know about this series:<br /><br />\\"Is it possible for two abuse survivors to have a functional romantic relationship?\\" - Eva Tramell<br /><br />\\"Eva's question is the core of the Crossfire series. The answer she receives (\\"Absolutely.\\"), gives her hope that she can find her way there with Gideon. I hope their journey touches you the way it has me. We all deserve a happily ever after.\\" (Sylvia Day)confirmed that there will be 2 more books in the series after this one.

B00607EWYC|2.0|Harding places a whole lot of emphasis on his style, I'll give him that. However, beyond his unique presentation, the book has nothing to speak of.  I'm perplexed as to why it won the Pulitzer. Harding--to me--comes off as desperately starved for the attention of English Masters degree students.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|In a lot of words,irritating, annoying. Annoying and irritating. Frustrating. Repetitive. Too, too, too, over the top, make me want to throw up romantic. I liked the first two books and I was excited for the third book to come out. But halfway through, I started to get pretty disappointed. Waiting for something to happen. Feeling like the book lacked a plot or storyline. I really didn't want to read about every mundane event that happened throughout her day and all these new characters and their little mini personal dramas. It felt like they were only introduced because the author had nothing better to drive the storyline. Eighty percent of the way through the book, when Eva forced Gideon to do something, I got so mad at her and felt so bad for Gideon, I nearly threw my kindle. Gideon was crying, for apparently a long time, and quiet and distant and upset, and then the author marked his behavior off as something else. What? Huh? Seriously? The situation. felt very unresolved to me. And badly written. All the sudden, he wasn't upset any more and he just loved her so much. But I was still upset on Gideon's behalf and I didn't like Eva after that. I started skimming the book, thinking the book was pretty bad, my only goal to get to the end. I had too much invested at that point. Even though I thought the book was kinda stupid, I needed to know how it was going to end. Guess what? There's going to be another book. Great! Well I have some predictions and I can say you learned it here first. Eva's father fixed the whole murder thing. The baby's not his and trey and Cary end up together. Gideon's mother makes amends with her son and is sooo grateful to Eva. And Ireland and Gideon become buddies. As for the rest of the characters, blah blah blah, who cares?  In closing there were some moments l truly enjoyed. I liked the stuff about Hudson's past. But those moments were too few.

B009NY43NY|4.0|Yes, I questioned it but once we got away from that first weird chapter (what there wasn't enough menace in Sookie's life, that Mrs. Harris had to invoke the devil?) then Sookie's voice came back again.  After that I still didn't enjoy this book as much as all the others.  And I knew whom Sookie would end up with from the start (didn't we all know it had to be him?).  Still I can't imagine my life without Sookie and will look forward to the very last book.

I don't like a lot of the games now since they want u to use money just to be able to get the things you want during play. You should mist be able to play them and get the stuff you want. Not dump a bunch of money in them.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|the movie came in great condition. i would recommend buying more blu rays from amazon save a lot of money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Personally I love it like the Pc version. Also I think that everybody who loves this game should get the PC version because its perfect. the only thing missing on here is a texture pack folder.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have to say, this game is the best and has great quality! Suggestion: price it CHEAPER!!! Other than that, GREAT! Pc version is better but minecraft on tablet is almost as good! Get it if don't already :D
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is by far my most favorite bingo game that I have on my kindle fire so far. Love how each room has its own caller with an accent to match the room. Give it a try very you will like it as well.
B0088WLM9K|5.0|While more like 'Battlestar Galactica' in its style, I felt the show had excellent drama, character development, and story.  Overall I thought it was a great show.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Never read this book before.  Just wanted to see how different it was from the movie.  It is not as much detail
B009TZ7WDK|3.0|Just as they did with Simon Cowell, when I saw the YouTube video of these two \\"kids\\" on \\"Britain's Got Talent,\\" I was simply astounded ... especially by Jonathan, one of the more powerful tenors I've heard since Pavarotti died. Mind you, Jonathan is no Pavarotti, but given time and maturation )and a good manager), he could be. I was happy to hear that he \\"holds back a bit\\" when singing the duets with Charlotte because he doesn't want to overpower her, something he could easily do.<br /><br />There are times when the orchestra is too loud, and while I can't fault these two singers, I do fault the producers who rushed these two kids into a studio with a mediocre orchestra and almost nonexistent orchestration. The more you listen, the more you'll hear that Johnathan is either trying to drown out the orchestra or vice-versa. The leader certainly should have done two or more takes, but again, Cowell knows that making a buck can be short-lived. I predict that in three months, you won't know who Johnathan and Charlotte are.<br /><br />Having nothing to do with the recording ... their story is inspirational as well, from the time that Jonathan said no to Simon Cowell's irrational suggestion that he \\"dump Charlotte\\" (a quote). Musically, they are a good match, not perfect, but good. And their aspirations are different from one another.<br /><br />For those who are thinking of nit-picking, Charlotte turned 17 just before the recording of the album, so they are the same age.<br /><br />EW
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I have listened to this three times in two days...now i can't wait til the weekend to play it over and over!!!! Love it!!! Buy it!!!!! QOTSA RULES!!!!!
0345528581|5.0|I reviewed several bodyweight training programs, and this one stuck out because of two reasons:<br />1) Mark Lauren is obviously the \\"real deal\\" - a person you can put your faith in to guide you to success.  He's not some fictional prison BAMF, and he demonstrates all the exercises himself.  I feel like all the exercises are actually obtainable, because he demonstrates them.  This is in contrast to Convict Conditioning, where there is no demonstration video anywhere on the Internet of a person performing a one-armed handstand pushup.  I was fooled into thinking this was obtainable.  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.<br /><br />2) The price of this book, his DVD set, and his iphone app are DIRT cheap, showing us that he's more concerned with getting his program out there and helping people than making a quick buck.  The iphone/ipad app is SERIOUSLY amazing, with over 200 video demonstrations for EVERY exercise, guided workouts and a log of completed workouts!  Oh, and it's $2.99!!!  I use the ipad and iphone apps, and I always have this book handy and read through the exercises while on my rest breaks.  The book has more details and variations than the app has, so it's very handy<br /><br />At first I thought working out around a door, a kitchen table and chairs was cheesy.  Let me tell you - these workouts are TOUGH.  I completed a workout solely indoors today, using a door, my kitchen chairs and table, and showed me that I really can get a great workout wherever I am.  I truly am my own gym!<br /><br />Buy this book.  Do the program.<br /><br />Thank you, Mark Lauren!
B003K16P3M|5.0|Depending on what you consider a story twist there should be at least two in this book, and they are all amazing. The book is well written and Katsa is a character you like and enjoy reading about. The other characters in the book support her fantastically, and you can easily find yourself liking them all. I was actually a bit sad to hear there were only two books in the series (three if you count the prequel, Fire), but I believe Fraceling is the only one that actually centers around Katsa; as much as I did like the other characters, I'm not sure if they are strong enough to stand without her.
B00C3ALLZ8|5.0|I love this cult movie, and after seeing some of the early reviews of the new Blu-ray, I couldn't wait to unwrap it.  Yes, it's presented at 1.85:1 for the first time.  But.....even though it's a new transfer, they use the same old print that Republic/NTA have been releasing on video for years.  The first reel is very distracting due to all of the speckling on the print.  Colors are muted and appear faded.  The sound is the same mono mix as always.  It's great to have this film on Blu and in the proper aspect ratio, but I expected too much, I suppose.  Olive Films has never done any clean up work on the Republic catalog titles, and I don't know why I expect that in this case.<br /><br />If you're a fan of this film, get this release.  Thus far, it's the only Blu-ray release of the title worldwide.  Just don't expect any major restoration work or extra features.
B003KJF2WE|4.0|The kids wanted to watch and enjoyed this movie very much. I enjoyed it more compared to other Hulk movies out there.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Contrary to all the bad reviews, I liked it. I am a die hard, Die Hard fan, even though I didn't really like #4, I thought #5 was quite good. Lots of action, dialogue, acting and directing was good too. Some camera shots were not as good as John McTiernan, but some were nice or even better, kept you close to the action. The car chase was ridiculously good and full of accidental looking mayhem. Really glad I got this on Blu-Ray to add to the collection. Great job Bruce and the gang, don't believe the reviewers. Some of us really liked it.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This is one of the best Disney movies with a Great message! This was a gift for my daughter who fell all over herself for this and will watch it many times. Great quality and always great doing business on Amazon!
B000FA675C|5.0|Have you not read this yet?  C'mon!  It's a fun read.  Also, you'll start to understand more references you'll hear on shows like The Simpsons and you'll stop saying that you really enjoyed Tom Hank's performance in the movie version.  Also, you'll stop saying you really enjoyed the movie version.<br /><br />Also, go ahead and read &#34;Angels and Demons&#34;.  It's a fun read as well.  If you accidentally read &#34;The Lost Symbol&#34; you can treat it like the 4th Indiana Jones movie (i.e. nobody talks about it and only acknowledges its existence when forced to).<br /><br />But yeah, fun book.  Read it.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|This was a great addition to the Bourne movies and I was very entertained. You won't be disappointed if you are a fan of this series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists and turns. Full of characters you love to hate and hate to love! I will be reading more books from this author soon.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The books are more descriptive, but all in all this is a pretty good movie and my family is happy to own it.
B00633W614|5.0|Excellently written and brilliantly conceived story. As in the first Clifton Chronicle, I am left scrambling to read the next!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I loved the first two books. I am not an avid follower of the writer nor should I have to be to find out her change in plans.  I had an inkling the book was no longer going to be a trilogy and was not pleased, but was willing to give it a chance. I could not get past the first chapters. I thought the writing was poor and there was too much sex and not enough plot . . . or at least not one that I found interesting enough to continue.<br /><br />Here is what I do not understand about the reviews so far. There have been a great number of negative ones of which I am in their camp. I do see the book as an overall product. How this author has presented the product is less than desirable and people have a right to complain. What I do not understand are the people who love the product ragging on those who do not, particularly with some of the limited name calling going on. I have yet to see anyone call those who love this book a name, for example gullible.  Of course, this is not my opinion of those leaving the five star reviews. While I disagree with their enthusiasm, I acknowledge with their right to absolutely love the book as stated in their opinions.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This was an amazing book!  I just could not put it down.  The entire series has been wonderful and I have anxiously awaited each book, but this was truly fantastic!  I was so excited about this release and it has not let me down in the least bit.  The male character was a strong dominant and I was so scared he would overshadow the woman.  Again, the author did not let me down.  The female was just as tough.  I love this author's ability to make strong female characters while still maintaining their femininity.  I also love the continuation of the psy part of the storyline.  I feel it was all brought together very well at the end.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I finished it this morning and was unimpressed. I gave the first two books five star reviews but this one is not happening for me. Too much repetiveness and way way too much sex without plot. Page after page of the same old same old.  And Cary and Eva continue to act like two foolish high schoolers. I'm really annoyed with Eva's conduct in regards to Brett as well. The relationship between Gideon and Eva doesn't feel right this time around.  And well, TMI on Gideon's grooming habits just was unnecessary. Oh well, I've read it now and I wish Sylvia Day had just answered the questions from books one and two, left out all the whacky filler, and just given Gideon and Eva their happy ever after. I paid the price for the product and won't be asking for my money back but, without a doubt, I'm finished with the Crossfire Series.
1616551151|5.0|It' s full of beautiful graphic images in the style of dragon age 2.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this for anyone interested!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I'm currently reading the 4th book in the bundle and wish it wouldn't end. This is a great series. Hopefully the 6th book will be out before too long.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's really addicting and I love that in a game. But everything is so expensive. Like the characters and stuff. Kind of annoying. But pretty cool otherwise
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I bought this for my kindle to read on a cross country airline trip. It was a great read; I hardly noticed that I was squashed in a middle seat for many hours.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I got 45 minutes in, but this movie is so bad I had to leave the theater. The chase scenes suck, the shootout scenes are impossible to watch. This movie blows.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting I spent hours last night playing this. My favorite part is seeing the graphics. It is very cool. If you make more free games like this I will definitely buy them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you haven't seen the movie, then the book isn't spoiled for you.  The book is way better than the movie, and well written.  That is often the case, though not always, as some books are not good, but the movie about them is good.  Read the book, there is so much more information in the telling and not the seeing.
B00C5GZKVQ|1.0|This game stinks. All you do is tap different buttons. In the first 5 minutes I played I was already bored. Im glad I didn't have to pay for this or I would command my money back.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OK here's the thing I am not going to give the book less stars or a bad review because of the ending, people who are doing that are just WRONG. It wasn't a bad book, the suspense was there, the drama was there, but I was looking for something the hang on to until the next book comes out. Gideon & Eva's relationship blossomed a lot since the last book & I loved the direction it was going in, but the book just ENDED without warning. So if I would change anything about the book it would be put an epilogue o end it differently. Also I loved the way how Eva & Gideon were way more playful with each other.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I went into reading \\"Entwined With You\\" expecting to give it at least a four star review. Needless to say, I was disappointed that I couldn't honestly do that.  However, my opinion has nothing to do with the series not ending on the third book.  I already knew there would be five books and I do like the story of Gideon and Eva enough to see it through. My rating has solely to do with the contents of this book alone.<br /><br />Unlike its predecessors, \\"Entwined With You\\" felt like it lacked an overall main story plot.  Instead it felt like I was reading a mish-mash of disconnected mini-story arcs that read more like a daytime episodic serial than a novel. With everything going on with Deanna, Corrine, Megumi, Cary, the \\"unknown person\\" and nothing intertwining, it felt like a jumbled mess of loose ends.<br /><br />Will I still read the next book in the series?  Yes. I only hope that Ms. Day can learn from her readers and take into account their criticisms when she writes her next tome.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game it's lot of fun, like the difference states that we can run in, the difference little people you can get and must importance thing is to beat your friends scores.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another hot read from Sylvia Day! The suckiest part about not being able to put it down and flying through it so quickly is having to wait for more!! I can't wait to see where the next book takes Gideon and Eva!!!!
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Definitely a let down after the first two in the series. I loved the first book, the second was very good, but this one was just so so...didn't keep me glued to the pages at all.<br /><br />I got bored in the middle...the plot wasn't exciting enough and I found myself skimming pages to get through it.<br /><br />I also didn't feel the same connection with Seb as I did Harry. Would have liked to have read more about his sister and her character development. The story line about his friend Bruno and his shady father just fell flat for me. All seemed a bit disjointed and even the ending left me cold.<br /><br />I don't know if I'll end up buying the next one.
030789701X|5.0|YE GODS.....The moment I saw this at my local gamestop I wsa amazed and bought it.  It carries all the strategies and hints of over 3000 hours of developer gametime to aid you the player in character creation to the actual game and item crafting.  The cover is solid and the binding was sturdy.  I actually have the ORIGINAL collector Skyrm book and put them side by side.  This one is about a third thicker and a lot heavier.  I definate must for anyone who likes collector guides or Skyrim.<br /><br />(I wonder if you can put it into the game and use it as a bludgeoning weapon - it probably could work of Skeletons..... :-)  )
B003WFKJRE|5.0|This is rightly considered the finest sung Ring ever, with Astrid Varnay, Hans Hotter, Wolfgang Windgassen, Gustav Neidlinger, Josef Greindl and Ramon Vinay in top form, it obviously is. ORFEO was granted for the first time the original tapes of the Bayerischen Rundfunks and the sound is admirable for 1953, it is true that the orchestra is recorded a little bit in the back but the voices are truthful and vivid. Overall I find this Ring much better conducted than the Keilberth. Clemens Krauss was completely different from both Furtw&auml;ngler and Knappertsbusch, his readings are faster, but never rushed and certainly exhilarating, in his own right he was a master Wagnerian too.<br />This is an historical document of the utmost importance, but it's also a very enjoyable one. The audio is infinitely better than either Furtw&auml;ngler Italian cycles.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|i am not quite sure if i liked entwined with you, but i am sure as hell that i loved the first and second book. i am not rating this book based on the author, i'll base my review by the book's content. While i was  reading this book, i felt that something was missing and that it lacks the  point of where the story intends to go. It was like filling the gaps of the story by plastering a scene/ situation from secondary characters which was not contributing on something that would make sense or make the story cohesive and i do not understand why the author had to do that as it was destroying a beautiful story. secondly, i noticed that there was always explanation about certain things ( e.g. the description of mark garrity's physical appearance. etc..)  that were already explained in the first and the second book  which reader's doesn't really need to read again as we are fans of the story. ofcourse we remember  and ofcourse we have read the 1st and second book, we don't need to be reminded. Lastly, i was 70% through  with the book when i started enjoying what i was reading.  i think the story was all over the place, i really wanted to love this book but it left me with a confused heart. what i liked about entwined with you is that some questions were answered which makes the story interesting. it also showed eva and gideon's interaction when they're alone, how eva was protecting gideon and how hard gideon was protecting eva. i don't mind purchasing another two books after this, i just hope for a beautiful ending for eva and gideon.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you have never prepared a Kindle book before and intend to, this is a must-read.  I've come across many poorly formatted Kindle books lately and if any of the authors had paid attention to these guidelines their books would look so much better.  There are many other advanced books out there for Kindle preparation but if you must have one - this is it.
030759565X|5.0|Most cookbooks have maybe one or two good recipes that you want to repeat  - this one is way better.  As soon as I received the book I immediately went through and flagged 19 of them to try.  So far they've all been winners - but the squash and onion galette is amazing!  Worth the price of the book alone -yum!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly had excellent writing, acting and that something special that all great shows have.  It did what all great genre work does and extended well beyond the genre.  My only complaint is that the series ended much too soon, but at least we have what was completed to enjoy.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm always nervous going into a series.  Especially, if I loved the first book so much.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised.  There were twists and turns around every corner.  I liked how it kept Cary involved, along with the other characters.  I'm excited to see where Gideon and Eva go from here.  What's going to happen with her parents?  It's going to be a long wait for #4.  Sylvia never disappoints.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved the end. I did not expect that.  You really have to read the rest to understand why this one is so good.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I really don't think I have to say much since it has already been said. EXCELLENT is what I will say. Right out of the package, I sharpened all of my knives, and it produced the BEST blade I have had to date. In a nutshell: Buy the Pocket Pal.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br /><br />I was a big fan of this series and was eagerly awaiting the release of the third and final installment. I wanted resolution for the character I'd come to care about. I was most unpleasantly surprised when I started reading only to see that Eva hadn't grown, but apparently was also reverting to her old ways. I mean Gideon KILLED A MAN for her and she can't even stay away from her ex - the ex who had made it clear he won't stop perusing her, even after Gideon makes it clear that he doesn't like her around him! Seriously? And Cary! I've lost all patience with Cary's character and his choices. He just keeps getting worse, I keep liking him less and less. Not to mention the new twists thrown in - Cary love triangle with a baby on the way, Gideon's mom being an uber wench set on destruction, the sex tape Eva unknowingly made with her rocker ex which is being auctioned off to the biggest bidder, among others - just for kicks apparently! As the end of the book kept getting closer I feared what I now know. There was no resolution, no finale to the &quot;trilogy&quot; - instead we'll get a five book series! I think by far the worst part was the Author's note claiming no way we can say bye to Eva and Gideon, right? Well guess what? I am saying bye to Gideon and Eva. I will be returning this book and would return the first two if it was possible. Such a great series ruined for me forever, I feel cheated.<br /><br />Sylvia Day has lost this reader.
B002LANLDK|2.0|I was turned off in the very beginning where they are hijacking a gasoline truck somewhere in Latin America.  They do all sorts of ridiculous automobile stunts (such as driving high speed in reverse, standing on the hood of a speeding car...) to steal the gasoline, when they could have more easily and with less risk taken the truck the old fashioned way - stopped it at a road block and made the driver get out and drive away.  Then there was the crappy CGI of the gasoline truck crash.  I thought it might get better, but it didn't.<br /><br />As the plot wears on, there is the typical rogue cop who is going to get fired any time now.  He beats up another cop and I have no idea why, and that is never resolved (maybe I wasn't paying enough attention).  The rogue cop does the typical extremely dangerous chase scene after some guy for something (does it matter?).  The main character's girlfriend gets killed, and I am still not sure why other than to piss him off at a Latin American drug lord who inexplicably lives in the US.  As the movie wears on, the Rogue Cop and good guy (played by Vin Diesel, and is actually a bad guy), go to Mexico to haul in drugs in very fancy cars though a tunnel while the Border Patrol is trying to catch them.  I'm sorry, but I still can't figure that out.  The tunnel is long, cut in rock, yet somehow the US Gov't didn't see it built.  Why did they bring attention to it by racing cars into it at high speed?<br /><br />The movie wraps up predictably with the bad guys getting arrested/killed in the most ridiculous way possible, the rogue cop somehow keeps his job and gets the girl...<br /><br />I suppose this got a good rating because it is high action, lots of car crashes and so on.  I also know I have to suspend disbelief whenever watching any kind of action movie.  However, this one pushed the limits of that, and I frankly feel the movie sucks.  Sorry...
B0060MYM3S|5.0|As always, Amazon delivered this package VERY quickly and for a great price.  I looked up the price on the HBO web site and quickly decided to purchase it from the usual place - Amazon.  It's a great series and can get addictive!  The special effects are super fantastic.  It keeps our interest and when we finished the series - we can't wait for the next season.  Well worth the money.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Awesome book can't wait to read the next one!  I don't know where it will take me next.  We will see

0425252868|5.0|This is absolutely the best written biography of a \\"first to last\\" Luftwaffe fighter pilot ever IMO. I have a bookcase full of interesting bios but none are as gripping as this one, it really reads more like a novel than a history.<br /> Franz Steigler lived not far from me in his later years and was a true gentleman and great story teller. Although I knew the legend of his encounter with \\"Ye Old Pub\\", the tale barely scratched the surface of the true story so well described in this book.<br /> From Lufthansa to the JV44 squadron of experts his career was nothing short of amazing.<br /> This is a fascinating read of chivalry and survival that held me until the last page.<br /> I rarely re read biographies except for bookmarked favourite passages, A Higher Call is one I know I will read again many times from cover to cover.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|After watching the first two seasons I decided to purchase A Game of Thrones A Song of Fire and Ice. So glad I did!! ! Now I have a better understanding of the motivation of these complex characters. HBO has done a fantastic job of bringing Game of Thrones kings queens and lords and ladies to life. The appendix is a must for identifying the alliance's and who's who of the Thrones.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Honestly, if you are reading this review, you have probably read all the other reviews for A Game of Thrones on Amazon. There really isn't much for me to add so I'll just say that I really enjoyed this book. It's definitely the last complicated of the series but it sets up so much in the way of characterization and plot that it's important to pay attention. Or, better yet, reread the book again. The pay off is worth it. Trust me :)
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Kudos.  Huzzahs.  We are not worthy.<br />Ms. Singh you've done it again.<br />In your human, changling, psy world the conflicts and shaky alliances are so complicated I wondered how there could exist a believable resolution that did not result in mayhem and madness.<br />Enter the absolute zero hearted Counselor Kaleb Krychek the undisputed scariest man on this planet.  A man of immeasurable power and no conscience.  How could he be a messiah.<br />The stock romance novel answer is the love of a good woman.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|\\"From the moment I first saw him-- saw through his stunning and impossibly gorgeous exterior to the dark and dangerous man inside-- I'd felt the pull that came from finding the other half of myself.

I love the way Gideon was more loving in this book. He goes above and beyond to keep Eva safe..Eva, although a bit too whiny at times, did finally fight for her man...<br /><br />I am glad there will be more of Gideon and Eva in the future and hope it is sooner rather than later. Their story is not finished by any means.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought this to give me storage on my umbrella stroller during a vacation to the Grand Canyon (I'll note here that my umbrella stroller is the cheap one,... I hate it, but it was cheap and small / lightweight,)<br />Anyway, it worked fine. It was a pain to have to detach it to take it on the busses. It would have been nice if it had slightly longer straps so I could carry it like a bag. But, it served its purpose for our trip - not at all upset with the purchase!!<br /><br />Then I took the kids to the zoo, using a jogger, and was happy to see that I could attach it, and add storage under the attached cup holders AND under the canopy. Our water bottles were in the shade! (see picture)<br />Since the jogger folds rather than collapses all around, I could easily leave it attached!<br /><br />To be honest, I wouldn't have given this product 5 stars until I used it with my jogger.
0307352145|2.0|Being an introvert, I was eager to read this book.  I made it about 1/3 of the way through it and gave up.  Not what I had expected.  It goes way too much into details that are technical and basically is just repetitive.

B0083TXXZ4|3.0|Bought this item because my son asked for it at Christmas. Don't think it is worth what I paid for it, but it's OK. Fires a lot of foam darts which makes it great so you don't have to reload as often. Craftmenship not so good as I think a plastic piece from the top kept falling off.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm disappointed the series did not end as a trilogy as advertised; however, with everything Eva & Gideon went through in Bared to You & Reflected to You it was nice to read about them being happy and united...for once.  When they are happy The sex is hot!

B005LAIH4A|1.0|I have put this movie on twice. The first time I fell asleep. The second time I made it all the way through by force of will only. It bears only the most passing resemblance to Dr. Seuss's book or the previous shorter cartoon movie. The book is pretty heavy-handed with the environmental message for an adult (though I never noticed it as a child), the movie even more so. The allusion to the bottled water industry is blatant to the point that it loses any fun factor. Overly technological, overly futuristic, overly far from the actual book. And it abandons the original framing device of taking place in a desolate wasteland, then being transported by The Once-Ler's words to the colorful past of the story. I hate it. Wish I could give negative stars.

B002RI9HT8|5.0|I have read a lot of reviews on White Teeth; by Zadie Smith. Most detail her grasp, and definition of multi-cultural families grappling with their traditional heritage. Oh, pot--and there's a lot of that too--I say, this is a book about people, a book that stretches your tolerance for humanity. A story about betrayal, disrespect, blame, hopefulness ... A story about you, or me. Not only is the book written with a touch, so light and humorous, as to have you gasping and giggling with sheer delight; it is dark too. Dark with the effort, and incongruousness of living. Dark with the secret hope we have for Irie, and the revulsion we feel for Magid's father. Dark with the need we feel on every page to take the fate of the protagonists and force a better life on them. I loved every page, I was ashamed, enraptured and entranced by each and every character this author had drawn for our dissection. This is an engaging story, a fountain of excellent writing. A pure joy to read. A book you would be sorry to miss.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was a very good book. It has great writing and concepts. Even if you don't have a boy o  girl at your school that is \\"deformed\\", it is very important to not judge/bully someone about how they look. This book really helps you understand  that concept in an extreme way.
B002DJSBMA|4.0|Beas Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are a dynamic team in this movie. The story is sweet and with a twinge of sadness. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone.

Well it is a very good book but it repeats knots in many places and yet they get a different number depending on where it is in the book. Same knot same name but different number.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I've read this book three times now in my life, and I find it amazing that every time you read this book, you get something new out of it, depending on the age. Phenomenal.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this was going to be a cheesy love story with a lifetime twist to it, but I was pleasantly surprised. Sparks has a way of getting you to personally know each character with all the tones he experiments with. I couldn't stop reading this. Fantastic job.

B00BEOYPKW|5.0|I had bought 'Smoke Ring for my Halo' when it came out and thought it was good but not great. I was surprised how much better &#34;Wakin&#34; is. The tunes are more varied than on SRFMH and each of the of first 5 songs is great: From the slow burn of &#34;Girl Called Alex&#34; to the much poppier &#34;Was All Talk&#34;.  Many of the songs break the 5 minute mark but Kurt has managed to keep them engaging over the longer play times.
1599218011|5.0|Love the book.  Well written and fun to read.  When I finished it, I passed it to a dear friend.  WARNING:  there is some foul language in the book.  You have to ignore it.  Still a great book.  Great seller and would recommend seller and book!  Thanks!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Even though this book  is sad it is still a very good book this is the first book in the series I've read and I will definitely read the next
034580404X|5.0|I have read multiple reviews about this product and I have to say that either you love or you hate!<br /><br />For my part, I loved it! Some reviews stated that there isn't enough &#34;storytelling&#34; in the book. I disagree with that statement. The author really did a wonderful plunging the reader into the book's universe, and the main character's inner though. Once I grabbed the first book, I couldn't put down, I wanted to know what will happen next. As you read the book, it is really easy to visualize the various scenes, there are enough details to create a full picture. I also very much enjoyed the characters' story arc. There is no doubt, that both, Anna and Christian, grow throughout the story. The books (all 3 of them) were really easy to read. English is my third language, and I did not get lost in the words.<br /><br />Although, I loved the book, there are a few things that I more or less disliked. First, some of the passages were kind of long. I can easily recall the parts that kept me on the edge of my seat and the ones in which I almost feel 'asleep'. It is especially true for the second and third book, as the first one really kept me wanting more. At some point, I alos got tired of the same sentence/same development during the sexual &#34;acts,&#34; e.g.: &#34;You're so beautiful! Do you know how hot you look?&#34;. It almost started to get annoying. I kind of laughed reading some reviewers stating that there was too much sex... I mean, it's a erotic novel, so sexual relations are to be expected. However, I sometime wished that some of them would get cut short and I really fought the urge to skip them as they seemed redundant - even though the author made sure to always have a different location. Lastly, I LOVED reading Christian's side of the story at then end of the third book, and honestly, it made me wanting more. I just wish that we could have had his side of the story a little bit more. The authors stopped at the purchases at the hardware store,but I have to say that I would have loved to know what he was thinking when they went for coffee and he did not kiss her when she fell in his arms... She could have went until the night and takes her to the playroom.<br /><br />Overall, I really loved the books and I highly recommend them. You might learn a thing or two... and I can't wait for the movie.

The '73 Michael Franks \\"debut\\" recording is also available on CD and is titled \\"Previously Unavailable\\" It's a very good recording that is very worthwhile to checkout, it also features strong session players like:<br />Larry Carlton, Tom Scott, Max Bennett and others.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series! It is so addicting! I never take the time to watch TV, but I can't get enough of this show.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Love this series! Not sure why I didn't  watch it on TV!  The character development is very good and the stories very touching and relevant.  Look forward to catching up on Season 2.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|What a cliffhanger! The next book needs to be out now! All the plot twists had me intrigued from start to finish.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great story, Great read, when I got it I couldnt put it down, read it straight through!! I hope they make a movie from this book. Its also refreshing when you read a WW2 book about a specific event rather than larger battles or theaters ... its nice to get these stories in print now. You hear about similar stories of old enemies meeting up now 65-70 years later, but nothing like this. Ive read about 5 reviews that gave this a low rating because they thought this book glorified Naziism or our WW2 enemy????, it does neither & thats not the point of the story or the book; When you read the last 2 chapters theres no way you can think like that....but hey-there are like 4 or 5 of you out there entitled to your opinion, no matter how ancient it is. The young author does a tremendous job gathering the information properly ; and with respect ; & I like the way he gave the backstory for both Charlie & Franz leading up to their encounter, but when you read the last 2 chapters you gain a real appreciation for this story the members of the \\"Greatest Generation\\" that are now willing to tell their stories while there are still some of them with us
1451695195|1.0|Many subjects were covered but very little had to do with the afterlife.  It was most disappointing and was a waster of time.
B00003CXBK|5.0|The movie was great, and written amazingly! I recommend this or anyone who's into anime. No one seems like a good guy or a specific bad guy, so it's really hard to figure out who to love and hate, haha. Enjoy watching!

B005LAIH2W|2.0|I was not surprised when this flopped at the box office.  And that wasn't just because of weak advertising.<br /><br />It's a mess.<br /><br />First, too much plot, too little coherence.<br /><br />The war on Mars generates no loyalty.  The Reds vs. the Blues, ho hum.  And then there are the Therns, who are never explained and who randomly choose sides.  (Who can blame them?  On the other hand, they are boringly robotic, so who cares about them?)<br /><br />The war on earth (the Civil War) ditto.  John Carter's anger and rootlessness is understandable, but uninteresting.  Yes, his wife and child (and side) have died, but this doesn't make him interesting.  His quest for gold is a yawn.<br /><br />Second, the characters are empty.  Not only is John Carter himself dull (all that jumping gets tiresome, but it's his best feature), so is everyone else.  Lynn Collins can act, but she isn't allowed to here.  Ditto the Tharks.  They have good voices but aren't interesting, except perhaps for Sola.<br /><br />Third, and most important, pacing.  This is an adventure movie, but the pacing is GLACIAL.  Bad directing all around.<br /><br />The special effects are interesting for a while, but no movie can survive on special effects, as George Lucas proved with The Phantom Menace (The Phantom Movie).<br /><br />All in all, long and uninvolving.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good It teaches you the word origins of words,helps you with pronouncing it.This book is a great book too help you with all your words even if it's you
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved this book so much. I'm so glad that Gideon finally opened up to Eva about his troubled past. Gideon loves Eva so much that he murdered the man who repeatedly raped her as a child to protect her. Nathan was coming after the only woman he's ever rudely loved so he killed him to protect her.  Eva's father finally learns what happened to her as a child. He is devastated but she puts him at ease showing him that she is ok now. An ex boyfriend of Eva's, who happens to be a hot famous rocker, comes back intrigue picture wanting Eva back. His #1 but was written about Eva and the world knows it. Gideon is sick with jealously but Eva convinces him she loves him and not Brett. Such an emotional ride. Someone set up a mob member for Nathan's murder to cover up for Gideon, but who? Gideon and Eva secretly elope in the Caribbean. When back home they keep the secret for now and announce an engagement instead. Corrine takes an overdose and loses her baby fathered by her husband when she learns of Gideon and Eva's engagement. Gideon feels responsible of course.  Cannot wait for next book. Love all these characters. Cannot wait to see if carry is really the father of Tatianas baby. Man I really hope he's not. In the end of book Eva and carry are preparing to leave for a weekend visit to San Diego to see Eva's dad. But Brett will be in town too. Can't wait to see what happens.

B008BU75IQ|4.0|Liked all Jeffrey Archer books.  However, this was too drawn out.  Too much of the political narratives.  The ending left me curious!
0425263991|5.0|This book was flippin' awesome!<br /><br />Kaleb is the hero of the book.  I am not sure why that was such a big secret since we all knew at some point that he would get a book.  His heroine was the person who he has been searching for lo' these many books.  People who pay attention to that sort of stuff guessed who she was based on some cryptic clues in early books.  Me?  I hadn't paid that close attention so her name didn't register at all.<br /><br />Her name is Sahara and she has a very unique Psy talent that turns out to be one of the reasons he was unable to find her.<br /><br />I don't really want to talk plot because honestly there is nothing really new.  A lot of things that have been bubbling in the last several books come to a head in this one.  Pure Psy, The Ghost, Kaleb's mysterious plans...all that stuff kind of reaches a critical mass. It is really satisfying, imo, to long time readers for all these things where the foundations have been laid to get some pay-off, even as she splinters out some new plot possibilities for future books.<br /><br />However the main thing that made this book so wonderful for me was the man in the center of it all.  Kaleb is a great construct of a character.  We have had 12 books to get to know him and to wonder about him.  Gratifyingly, Singh does not make him a hero-hero.  He is, to my mind, the definition of an anti-hero.<br /><br />Kaleb has no moral center.  He really doesn't.  He has a personal code of things that are acceptable to him or not acceptable to him.  He very clearly and calculatedly understands that ends justify means.  He is shown doing 'heroic' things in this book.  But I think that the author very clearly shows that Kaleb's actions, every thing he does, he does out of personal self interest.  It just so happens that his self interest is very much bound up with the woman he has been searching for for years.  If she had asked him to kill a small town, he would do it no questions asked, no remorse and no judgement of her request.<br /><br />Luckily she doesn't.  Sahara has a very moral center and she acts as his conscience.  Going into the story the idea of Kaleb as a hero and falling in love fascinated me because I wondered how Singh would work around his Silence.  Would she break it?  Is he even Silent at all?  In [[ASIN:0425251098 Tangle of Need (Psy/Changeling)]] the author played around with 'mating' convention.  A wolf mates for life and yet the heroine of that book was not the hero's natural mate.  I liked how she worked around that convention and I thought she did a similar job with Kaleb's Silence.  We certainly do not get shortchanged on the love story.  Even if Kaleb is not warmly demonstrative (he never once cracks a smile)the reader is never, not once in doubt of Kaleb's total devotion to Sahara.<br /><br />I was also gratified with the fact that the Changelings are not very present they do show up later but have limited page time.  We are in Kaleb's world in this book.  It really reminded me of some of the earlier books in the series, especially my favorite,[[ASIN:0425218422 Caressed By Ice (Psy-Changelings, Book 3)]].<br /><br />Aden and Vasic also get a lot of face time.  They quietly rock.<br /><br />If I have one quibble with this book I would say that Sahara's recovery from her trauma felt a little too easy.<br /><br />But in the end, I was sad when I finished this book.  It reminded me of when I first discovered the series when there were already five books published and I gobbled them down one after the other.  The world is really immersive I wanted to stay there longer.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie was like many of the other remakes I had heard about in the last dozen years.  A \\"re-boot\\" as they like to call them, trying to breath life back into a franchise.  Also, much like the others they are using the same names and doing about the same things, but, unlike the others, this time with Star Trek they hit a home run.  This is still a Kirk and Spock tale, same kind of characters just modified circumstances around them growing up and choices they might have made had they decided to go left instead of right.  The premise is that a time traveler changed something in the past that had a ripple effect through the whole universe, the Butterfly effect in a way.<br /><br />I thought this was really well done, the names and the personalities are about the same but it is like seeing a beloved characters with a different background story.  Do good people grow up to be good guys if they don't have the same background, same no, similar yes.  It was fun and I am looking forward to the next installment, worth the time to watch and in my opinion worth adding to the collection.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Very clearly written and succinct.  Very useful examples.  It's clear the author has lived this and not just researched the topic.  Would highly recommend especially for executives.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|It arrived promptly in good condition.  I love the series.  It is great to be able to read the subtitles to find out what was actually said.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|The one good thing I can say about buying this piece of **** is that I didn't waste a tremendous amount of money on it. Everything else is an absolute Fail, from the self-obstructing battery compartment to the lack of any indication that it's operational. The mic just flat out doesn't work. It *might* be that it was shipped with a dead battery? But I have no way of knowing until I schlep to the store to buy a new battery and test that theory. In any case, I'm sorry I ever wasted my time with this piece of crap.

B0000714BP|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! And, after watching several seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race, I can really appreciate the quality and commitment of the performances! For actors who are primarily known for action films to slip on those heels and rock it? Just have one word - fierce! It's a very funny movie was some really touching moments. I love how they change a little town in middle America. And, I love the bond between Miss Clara and Noxeema Jackson (Snipes). I watch whenever it's on cable and have the DVD.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Brilliant movie - beautifully shot and with Polanski's eye for detail. Very funny/quirky and atmospheric. I loaned it to a work colleague who thought Polanski only made horror films like 'Rosemary's Baby', she was amazed when confronted with this one. She thought it was great. Everyone is always very impressed with the ballroom scene with all the mirrors and the vampires dancing. The colours are fabulous and the outside scenes remind one of s Christmas card. If it's ever on t.v. it's always on around midnight or after, so I had to buy the DVD. Definitely one to watch late at night when you're alone!! It took me years to find it on DVD. I think the one I eventually bought was an import.

0525478817|5.0|This is absolutely one of my favorite books of all time. It is also the first of John Green's books that I've ever read, and since then I've read all of his books. I loved this book, and I gave it a five star rating because John Green deserves it for writing such a fantastic novel that many people have enjoyed.<br /><br />-Carrie
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief was an amazing book because it was thrilling, shocking, confusing, and sad. This book was thrilling because there's a lot of excitement and pleasure in this book like when the bombing happened in Himmel Street and when Liesel stole books. This book is shocking because there are a lot of unknown things that happened unexpectedly. There are very surprising to the reader. This book is confusing because there is changing settings, different topics, also there are things that are hard to understand, but it makes you want to keep reading. Finally this book is sad because people get killed; there is a lot of bombings and death. This book was the best book I ever read, this is a book recommended for everyone and a must read for all!!!!

B003XMXZCW|5.0|I invested in a Blu-Ray player long, long before I ever really felt convinced by the &#34;quality&#34;. The Blu-Ray's I already owned didn't look that much different, and I thought to myself how lame it was that I paid $10 extra for something I wasn't realizing.<br /><br />Enter: Apocalypse Now on Blu-Ray. Now, some have disagreed with me on this, but I will state that I really think that watching this movie on a proper HDTV is akin to seeing it projected live. Everyone who's watched it with me has agreed that it's the best quality home entertainment they've ever seen. The colors are so textured and rich, the figures to clearly defined and the sound resonating at perfect pitch crystal clarity. Every time I watch this movie on Blu, I'm blown away by how<br /><br />STELLAR AND BEAUTIFUL<br /><br />it looks. No really, this movie is a must for any serious film fan but the blu-ray is an ABSOLUTE must!
B005WQ4RP6|5.0|A great thriller with a very good cast.  I love a good thriller without all the blood and guts that so many films have these days.  One of my favorite movies for my home collection.  Quick shipping.

0142410705|4.0|How could I not fall in love with a John Green book? Although this wasn't my favorite of his novels that I've read, I still dealt with an obsession with the characters and plot almost as much as I did with The Fault in Our Stars.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm so irritated right now. This is only the second review I've ever written, ironically my first review was a 5 star review on Ms. Day's Bared To You. Like everyone I preordered this book and was so excited when it popped up on my kindle. Boy, I jumped right in and stayed somewhat intrigued. I kept thinking, ok this is the last book so all will make sense in the end. Then I get to 90%, thinking ok I'm not getting answers, like where the hell is Megumi? And they haven't travelled to San Diego, wtf!!! I honestly thought it would just end up being a mad dash to get the answers to my questions. Then 95%, hmmm ok still no Megumi, still haven't travelled to San Diego yet, wtf!!! 99% is when I said &#34;aw hell no and WTF!!!!!&#34; Yeah I'm done, asked for a refund, and will not purchase another Sylvia Day book! Shame on Sylvia. You sold out to the man!!! Trilogy means 3!!!  Not that it matters to you ( you've  made it quite obvious you don't give crap about your fans) but you've lost a fan.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have looked forward to this book for what seems like forever.  I am seriously disappointed.  It had all the right ideas to be a great book and end happily ever after. Well that didn't happen.  The book was all over the place, the storyline was whack.  Gladly I learned from a previous review that it could be returned.  It disappoints me that it has now turned into a five book series.  I hate being drug on and on just get it out already.  I love these books and the characters but I am disappointed in the direction the \\"trilogy\\" is going.
1451696191|5.0|I gave this book a five-star rating because I absolutely fell in love with it entirely - the writing style, the characters, the plot, absolutely everything. I loved this book so much and I have talked about it and recommended it to many other people.<br /><br />-Carrie

1933952806|4.0|Darrell Young has created a little niche for himself writing these helpful books on Nikon cameras.  He does a good job explaining the features of the camera and how to use them, including his own recommendations for what settings to use.  Much better than the owner's manual, and forget about contacting Nikon Customer Service.  Those people know nothing about photography.  You're lucky if they can tell you which button to push to take the lens off the camera.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Another hit from ZeptoLabs. It's less intense then Cut The Rope due to the lack of a time limit, but that doesn't diminish the fun at all.<br /><br />A great game with sane permissions!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The novel was based on facts.... I was totally unfamiliar with the subject....it was fun to read and very meaningful...I'd recommend it to everyone!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Truly one of the best shows I've ever watched. Writing and characters are phenomenal. Can't wait for the new season.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Excellent story of valor and the ultimate sacrifice!  Proves what we who serve do it for! The country and its PEOPLE!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|&#34;An RPG based on match-3? Just another puzzle quest clone.&#34; you might think. WRONG!<br /><br />10M is exceptionally simple in concept and masterfully executed. The control of the board is smooth and fluid, and the constant need to keep defeating challenges QUICKLY adds pressure and intensity that was sorely lacking in Puzzle Quest. I've missed my bus stop more than once because I was closely focused on a run. (Oops!) Maybe put the device down when I'm near my stop...<br /><br />Very worth the $2. TL;DR: Buy this game now.
B000JQUMPI|3.0|I wanted Jo to end up with Laurie lol c; but I guess so does everyone else ohh whelll. :) x
B007XH6BPG|5.0|Thanks to Steve Hackett and Chris Squire real music continues to exist in this pitiful time in music and art.  This album is 9 tracks of listener joy.  Lyrically, it makes you think about all the good times we had listening to Yes and Genesis in the 70's.  Sonically, it drives you there like a new machine.  Song structure wise, it's melodic, strong, fast, slow, evocative, loud, quiet.  Yes, it's pretty much everything a prog rock should do.  And when the musics over,  .............. Applaud!
B007EE4XKI|4.0|It's been a while since I read a Star Trek book and a lot has changed in the interim.  Picard and Crusher are married with a kid.  Worf is first officer and has a new love interest.  Riker is in command of his own ship, the Titan.  The Dominion War is over and the Enterprise has a Cardasian officer.  The Federation faces a new enemy known as the Typhon Pact.<br /><br />Prior to his death, Data's memory was loaded into \\"B-4\\" his simple minded predecessor \\"brother.\\"  These memories are more than B-4 was designed to take however, and they must be deleted or B-4 will die.<br /><br />When the top secret Starfleet security installation where the androids are studied is breached and the androids stolen, it is up to the Enterprise to investigate and retrieve them.  Along the way they encounter Data's creator, Noonian Soong, who has transferred his consciousness into an android body of amazing capabilities.<br /><br />It's hardly a spoiler to state that Soong saves Data and B-4, but I was impressed by the plausibility of the mechanism by which this is done.<br /><br />Fans of Data and Noonian Soong will particularly enjoy this book, and I can't imagine any TNG fan who does not fit into this category.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT - I particularly liked the (very minor) subplot of the Federation's recognition of Data and other sentient androids, and the mysterious AI group of unknown size and purpose.  I hope we learn more about this group in the second and third books.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|I looked forward to this movie from the time I saw the first commercial.  Russell Crowe is normally fantastic and Marky Mark has come a long way from his funky bunch days.  That being said this movie was an utter disappointment.<br />Needless characters, the whole relationship with the girlfriend was pointless.  I know there is a connection but it seemed like filler. The gay relationship seemed to be thrown in there for no reason what so ever.  It had nothing to do with the plot.<br />The whole plot and build-up just kind of falls off. What Russell Crowe is hiding is not that monumental.  Yes it is illegal but I think it is something that goes on all the time and wasn't really that surprising.<br />The acting throughout was flat.<br />I would not recommend unless you have some time to waste on a rainy Saturday afternoon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this game so much fun! It's the most amazing game of the whole world that I have ever played!
B000PKX2KA|4.0|After many months of use I have noticed that in my car, this product some times takes more that half hour to acquire a lock if the car is moving.  Other times, it obtains a lock in about 7 to 8 minutes.  As drive to work is under 7 minutes, I rarely get a location lock.  The timing was much better during the initial months of use.<br /><br />Four stars though for once it obtains the location, it rarely looses it or turn incorrect for minutes that my delorme used to do.  once delorme placed me on a road that was 500 yards away for more than ten minutes.  GSBU353 v4 have only lost its accuracy once may be twice in bad weather for just a moment or so.<br /><br />I wish the dome super capacitor was a little better to provide trickle current allowing it to hold the position lock for 48 hours or more
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It was working fine until a update pushed through. Now it does not. Uninstalled for another program. C'mon, don't break a app like this with a update.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Everyone told me to watch this show but I was so far behind. I started watching season 1 and I finished it in less than a week! So smart and funny..I definitely recommend it.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I chose this rating because the entire CD was very well done.  She has the voice of an angel.  She sounds like she's actually singing from that era.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this app is much much much more fun than the other salon games because here are a lot more things to choose from and it seems like it is more real than the other salon games.  get this app now!!!!!!!!! :)
B00756GRUE|4.0|The date display is the only thing about this watch that I can find anything to critique. It would be nice if it was just a little bigger. It sits just a little recessed and makes it hard to see if the minute hand is hovering over it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What a great purchase. I was so happy I bought it and enjoyed each and every cd. Can't wait til season 4!
B00992CF6W|5.0|A great app, I play it all the time. Mojang did pretty good. You should get this app, especially if you like to build things.
B000H4TX9I|3.0|The reviews were awesome- obviously a true fan following, but I was a little disappointed in the language.  So far, I haven't seen an underlying message- aspects of human behavior that were evident in original Star Trek- just their story.  Will finish first year to see if the relationships develop and the story gets more interesting.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is great, mindless, fun, but maybe too easy as you can tap a card without knowing there is a place for it and the game will find and place the card,if there is a play.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a brain trader that makes you think.  if you like to use your brain and figure out puzzles GET IT!!!
B0031ESIZQ|3.0|Game is okay, not at all what was expected. Good value, but not very easy to play as other versions. probably wouldn't recommend to others.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I can't stop playing it. There are lots of optional levels to always challenge even the most experienced player. I love it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is cool. I like it a lot. it is very fun. I wish the minecraft 0.7.0 update would come out for the kindle fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Omg I just cannot wait to start the next book I'm hooked!!! It's a must read and hard to put down!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Enjoyed book very much. A very interesting story , kept one,s interest. Fast moving and unpredictable characters. Looking forward to the second book in the trilogy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game that was ever made in history I love minecraft so much and I got it when it was on sale for $3.99
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|OMG. Thought I'd find out the outcome of Gideon & Eva to only find out S. Day is continuing the story. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, just had to wait so long for this one that I had to reread the last one to remember what the story was about. I hope her next book won't be that long of a wait.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Guys, Don't get so mad at Amazon for not getting the 0.7.0 update right away. They can be a little late on updates. BUT,Amazon read this. You should get updates as soon as possible. Don't leave us hanging for an update. It is not fair that Apple can get the update first, but we get it 1 or 2 weeks later. Overall, People, do not get upset that we did not get an update right away. But Amazon should get updates as soon as possible. By the way, Minecraft Pocket Edition is a great game.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this game is awesome it has 3 different types of matchs teamdeath, domination, and quickplay. if I could have anything more out of this game I would want a free for all and other game modes. PLANES PLEASE GIVE US PLANES and 2-4 more maps. I'll be there for the up date and anyone who reads this should to. keep up the good work gameloft(:
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was  by far my favorite of the series. It was steamy,jot,sexy, disfunctioal and then some I loved it. Can't wait for more. I hope it won't take long for part four.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written story that keeps you turning the pages  .  Landay's skill  and a fascinating  plot  get you hooked from the first page ... a definite read
B00127RAJY|4.0|Loved this DVD so much I've now purchased 3 other Jillian Michaels DVDs.  I've been training with a personal trainer a couple of times a week for a few years but I honestly feel I've gotten more out of the 30 Day Shred DVD in 3 weeks then I have in the last few months of personal training.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change is that warm needs to be a little longer (but it is a 20 minute workout, a short warmup is to be expected).  I do my own warmup for about 2-3 minutes before Jillian starts.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Always great stuff from Anker!! It's all we carry for Batteries and Chargers!<br />18 Moth Warranties!<br /><br />Sprinter Technology Services<br />Sprinter Cellular
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I love Michael Buble's music. He surpasses Frank Sinatra and Perry Como.  Wonderful voice and romantic, too.  Love it! Love it.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a very relaxing and addictive game. I like the fact that you can re-play  the whole thing by changing names or just play certain games again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Come on Amazon . Minecraft Pocket Edition 0.7.0 has been released.  Get  the update.  Right now it is the # 3 paid app. The update would probably help the reviews. We want the update.  Its a perfect game, but we want a freaking update. COME ON!
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|This game is absolutely great! its worth the money. its a little challenging at some points but that's what makes the game fun, right?
B0015AARJI|5.0|Same basic design since the original Dualshock came out and the same rumble since DS2. If you've been playing video games since the PS2 you know what to expect... and that's a good thing
0061733199|5.0|Purchased this book for my son who is 12 and learning to be an outdoors man of sorts. He loves to fish, camp and hike loved this book especially attempting the different survival task as illustrated. Great instructions and diagrams.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Kindle fire should get the new update to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If iPod gets it at not kindle fire. I mean really PEOPLE.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I want my money back. The wait, the content, all of it is horrible. I expected more, and the note at the end was almost the worst part. SHe obviously acknowledged how short and horrible the book is.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was worried about buying this book with all of the bad reviews, but I had to see for myself. I was pleasantly surprised! I also wished that Gideon and Eva would have their happy ending, but I am looking forward to two more books. I don't believe it was all filler and I truly enjoyed getting wrapped back up in Gideon. That man is pure sex on a stick! A sultry summer read!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I purchased this battery for my 8&quot;kindle fire everyone needs to get<br /> one it is free and worth it thanks Thomas a.
0425263924|2.0|While I love the story of Gideon and Eva, I too was disappointed to learn that there are still 2 more books?!?! I pre-ordered this book in October of last year because I was so excited to see how their story was going to end, and now Im sure it will be at least another year before I find out!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod has bothered coming back to songwriting .. And that's good news !<br />Truly touching songs , his voice sets wonderfully too.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Pudding monsters is puzzle solving fun. Reminds me of Quell a bit. Good for wasting time in a waiting room. I  probably wouldn't play for a long time, but I like it for short time play.
0316247545|5.0|Amazing! Really everything you need to know in one book. A must have for any fan of the show.<br /><br />P.S The blue section on the bottom of the book in the picture is just a dusk cover type thing.<br />Its main covering is in the style of the brown and gold part. Very pretty.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|Like other readers who pre ordered this book I was waiting expectantly for it to come.  Well what a waste of energy.<br />I am sorry I even opened my reader.  I did not get past page/ location 210. Once I learned that it was no longer a trilogy I did't bother.  I am tired of being duped into buying books only to learn - when it is to late that I have to buy another and then another.  I hope the publishers and indeed authors learn from this disaster, after all<br />we, the readers have the last say. Sorry Sylvia you have lost me.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I heard them perform on TV.  Didn't know who they were but immediately loved the sound.  Researched and bought this and I enjoy every single track.  Learned the group is from Colorado Springs... love the area and my family there.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Just beat the first world while I should be working.  Haha good fun! I hope they continue to introduce new kinds of puddings.
159463176X|3.0|First let me say that overall, I enjoyed this.  Although sad, it's lyrical and very well done.  Khaled Hosseini is a fabulous writer.  I have to give this book 5 stars for the WAY it's written-- it's beautiful and poignant and the kind of novel that will probably win a lot of literary awards.<br /><br />However, I have to give it 3 stars in terms of my enjoyment of the plot.  It's very different from Hosseini's other two novels in that it's not a linear story.  The format is NOT \\"this happened, then this happened, and then this happened.\\"  Instead, it jumps around a lot, across generations, to different continents, following different members of the same family, plus a few characters who are connected to the family but not actually related.  You'll learn a lot about each character and why they are the way they are, and they're all connected in some way, but altogether this doesn't form a cohesive \\"story.\\"<br /><br />I also have to say that it's pretty depressing.  Hosseini's other two novels are also very sad, but I felt that there was a greater element of hope in \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" and \\"The Kite Runner.\\"  Or maybe it's just that, while those stories were both sad, the author gives us a little more excitement as we race toward the conclusions.  With those, I could never wait to find out what would happen next.  I didn't have that feeling with this one.<br /><br />I still think this is worth reading, especially if you like the author.  By the same token, if you've never read Hosseini before, I wouldn't start with this one.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I cant get the new update I go to the app store and it doesn't show the update and I really want buckets
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Hard to get acorns:(  I would like to see more things you can get with icons.<br />Addictive game ...  Love it!
B0085W09ME|3.0|sometimes it has the info right now. sometimes I have to keep rechecking. maybe status isn't available to them, but it is ok, for the most part
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|As a teacher of 30+ years, I experienced the loss of several kids and their cancer stages...chemo, amputations...It is riveting and this novel attaches it an a realistic and minimally depressing and hopeful way. I recommend, especially to a teen who may be experiencing something similar at school.
B0067R0APK|2.0|when I purchased this app (Platinum version) it was great. Then is changes to a completely different format and it sucks compared to my original version.<br /><br />Advice to your programmers: LESS IS MORE.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Just really enjoyed it being right there, not having to look for the remote, while I'm reading can just look on my accuweather to see what the weather is going to be like.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I like this game a lot. It's just that some of the words are very hard to draw. It's a fun way to try out your talents.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|This music is beautiful, Mr Porter's voice is smooth and you get the feeling he is singing just to you.
B0000C1733|5.0|This disc has a great song list, maybe a few of their best hits are missing, but this cd pretty much covers it. Overall it's a great buy! I Highly recommend it!<br /> you can't go wrong with this one!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Such funny looking and sounding monsters. A great time killer. Really enjoy the different levels. Not too difficult, but still requires you to think a bit on how to solve the puzzle. Really enjoying this game. A must have.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|great movie I never read any of the books but, had no problem following it. Good suspense all the way through highly recommend this.  P Carson
B006WQLH7G|1.0|This app does not work on Kindle Fire HD.11 more words required to fill up the space on this review.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is something fun to check out and try. I don't have enough time to view all the items and ideas in there. FUN!!!
B004SEUJ82|5.0|First off, I'm not one to purchase movies/dvds.  But, I do purchase ones that I believe for myself to be a 'classic'.  I read about this somewhere and I rented it - it absolutely moved me.  The acting, the subtleness of human deception and how this IMPORTANT time in the history of our lives happened.  And also, about young innocence, love and friendship.  I'd compare this movie to the Corrie Ten Boom series.  Excellent.
B002O3Z50G|5.0|This is a great movie, not only is there action from the tornadoes themselves, but there is also good character development and plot. I would recommend it to anyone :)
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This was a major disappointment!! SD left me with more questions and answers and a lot of passages were really redundant, like she had different people writing different chapters. I should have stopped at &#34;Reflected in You&#34;.
1781162646|5.0|Loved Joyland, he hasn't written like this in years. Far exceeds the last hard case outing The Colorado Kid. The context of carny life was clearly something he enjoyed penning. I burned through this baby in less than a day, a classic pulp read of the highest caliber. Nicely done, Steve. Oh, btw, you whiners who are crying about no e-book format are completely missing the point. You know, honoring the literary past by making you read hard print, just like he did with his drugstore rack beat up tattered copies of pulp mystery thrillers, the very same genre he homages here.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I love phil Collin's, I would recommend it to anyone. He is one of my favourite singer's ever, he's just the best.
0425263924|1.0|This is the first review that I have ever written.  I just could not sit here and not complain about the entire Crossfire Series.<br />1.  I think that Day wrote all of them AFTER 50 Shades was so popular.  She is just making it up as she goes along just to cash in on the popularity of 50 Shades.<br />2.  It seems to me that she must have read 50 Shades before she even wrote the first book.  Does everyone have to be 28, good looking and rich?  The similarities are so obvious you almost know what is going to happen next.<br />3.  I am 65 and LOVED 50 Shades (I know, embarrassing!!!)  I really thought 50 Shades was a love story and had a real plot to it.  I was so upset when it ended.  This series is just long, drawn out and appears to be made up as she goes along.  I do not think that even Day knows what is going to happen next as she has not even written it yet.<br />Ok, sorry to vent but I want something that stands up to 50 Shades and this series is NOT it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What an exceptional book with many twists and turns. This author knows how to write so you don't want to stop reading until it's done. Well thought out and perfectly paced thriller. Offers lots of things to think about.
B000FC12SM|1.0|This book puts forth the idea that men should be treated like children and that women have to be the grown-up, all the time. If that's the case, I'd rather be a lesbian, or alone. Do not waste any money on this book. It's the most idiotic book I have ever read in my entire life. I read the whole thing, despite thinking it was infuriating. It was pap from beginning to end. Awful.
B009NY43NY|3.0|In my opinion this will be a book you really have to read before you'll have a solid opinion on the outcome.  By reading the other reviews, I can see there are many variables included in what makes some people love it and others hate it.  So...if you've read all the rest, you may have to read this one for yourself and not let the Amazon reviews sway you either way.<br /><br />(Contains spoilers.)  I've suspected for a long time that Sookie would end up with Sam, so this did not come as a surprise to me.  I really love Eric and I liked him and Sookie together but I never felt like it could be permanent because she wanted children, did not want to become a vampire, and Eric really is a ruthless bastard to nearly everyone else but Sookie.  Sookie did bring out some humanity in Eric but I never felt like it was enough to make the relationship last forever.  One thing I am glad about is that she didn't end up with back with Bill in the end!<br /><br />I agree with those that say this book felt rushed and seemed to include a lot of characters that didn't necessarily need to be there.  Had she focused more on certain story aspects and left out unnecessary characters the story would have been better, which is why I'm going with a 3 star review.  I still really like Charlaine Harris' writing style and will continue to read books by her.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Fun! But it went too fast! Hope they make more of these games! Cant wait for the next game to come out
B000R7HY0K|5.0|This is a great film, I love Kurt Russell, it was strange to see him acting as a psycho, but he was great in it.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Review for 3d bluray its simply spectacular particularly the 3d effects are awesome & the 7.1 audio is great too. The video is 16:9 meaning it has black bars on top & bottom but I have a Panasonic projector which can be adjusted to full screen (Zoom it to 1.2x) & you get almost full screen. I would highly recommend to buy this bluray for the fantastic 3d effects.
B002Z58GQS|2.0|I can't get it to work with my Windows 7 very disappointed in this drive.freezes my pc would not recommend the jetflash 300  sorry
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I enjoy being able to mix and match sounds.  It works for children and adults!  My kids like to pick the sounds and are more willing to relax and sleep.
B00992CF6W|2.0|there is no buckets. Wont allow me to get the updates. There is no seed guide. I rarely play on it because it is a waste of money. It cost me over 5 dollars when I got it. Nobody bought it so they lowered the price.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a horse fanatic, and this game is great for horse lovers.  What you can do is:  You have to take care of a horse (When you go to friends then to your profile, you can change its name) to gather up its health, heart, and energy. When it has a sufficient amount, you can enter it in competitions. To gather up your horse's health, heart, and energy, you need to care for your horse- like grooming it,  feeding it, etc. You also can earn gems by completing tasks or gaining a level. You'll need gems and coins to by snacks and gear for your horse and rider. I love this game and I totally recomend it to horse lovers.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Wonderful!  It reminded me of the Apollo 13 movie.  Even though knowing (or suspecting) the ending, didn't make it any less suspenseful.  I enjoyed every word!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Although I have many CDs, there are not a lot that I enjoy listening to straight thru from beginning to end.  This is one of those that I can, and do, over and over.  I love this music!  There's slow, sultry, funky, upbeat, fun, emotional...  I've loved Adam's voice and style since American Idol but he's just gotten better and better!  Something about it just touches my heart  &#60;3 Also, the CD has all the song lyrics in it, if that matters to you.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|This is a great read. Yes it isn't the end of the series like everyone hoped for but I would rather read another two books and have everything wrapped up propper than just rush to finish. In this book Eva and Gideon have so many issues going on that there needs to a few more books to resolve them all. Go into this book knowing you won't get the end of story and you'll love it. I just think people get mad because they expect the end and are mad when it doesn't come and that's understandable but this is a great book and a great read.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|it's fun for a time but the kids got bored with it quite quickly.  It is kind of like the dog that you would download to chase your mouse on your laptop.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this game is so fun and awesome I think evreybody should get this game. I wish they made more games like this.
B00138H0H4|5.0|Can't stop listening. I am truly addicted. A great complete listen from start to finish. It is rare that I find a complete album that does not need a song to be skipped over.
B007SGM084|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think at first, but what an incredible set of stories.<br />A little more animated than what I would normally read, but it was great!<br />I hope that maybe the author will continue the story for us with some of the other characters too!!!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is amazing for the kindle fire it is 1 of the best 1st person shooter games out there this is a definite get a must have the graphics are really good I am happy I bought this app
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|At least I am not alone in this.  How can we have been left hanging and how long will it take?  I really enjoyed the first two books and have looked forward to this third book since last October.  I even began re-reading the first two last weekend and then reading Entwinded with no real ending? Not to mention even a real hint of the next book and when we can expect it? If the wait is too long, I know I will not pick up the last two books.  It is a shame that such a well written series to date will take a hit in the review department based on the marketing and poorly planned release of the series.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Shame on Amazon for not only not removing this horrid app from their store but also attracting additional victims, offering it as free app of the day. It never worked! What did occur was my device started to glitch out with various issues. It even caused my device to erroneously delete  pother apps! Internet access stopped working until it was deleted, device rebooted &amp; cleared browser cookies &amp; cache. Don't download! Very bad!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved this book!!! So great!!!  Can't wait to see where Gideon and Eva end up next! :) I love them!!
B00466HM28|5.0|I produce music on my computer as a hobby and this has made it much easier to get the notes from my mind onto the screen. ive only explored a few of the features this controller offers but it has thoroughly impressed me thus far. buy it
B000N2HBSO|5.0|After reading the book, I promptly purchased the audio version to glean a few morsels of history that I may have missed. Truly a great work in historical detail and accuracy.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Just re-watched this with my nine-year-old and he loved it! You just have to skip a part or two (like the part where Gary Sinise gets a prostitute). The rest of it was fine And a great movie for all ages!
B0090KZDSK|5.0|\\"I feared what would happen if he came at me full force when I was so starved for his body.\\"<br />\\"He was shaking, and I cried, overwhelmed by the knowledge of how much he needed me.\\"<br />\\"My passion was for him, my desire inflamed by his desire for me.\\"<br />**************<br />These are not sentences a one star book contains. Sylvia sure didn't wait many seconds before making it hot and heavy and intense as hell. I had my heart practically POUNDING reading it.<br /><br />This book has a lot of Eva and Gideon in it. It shows his love for her. It's the love I love so much about this series and Gideon himself. So much. So intense. Everything gets explained. And their love has moved to another level. It's built up for it...The whole beginning of the book. Like something inevitable.<br /><br />Then there are also a lot of other things happening at the end of the book.<br />Brett is back. Cary. Megumi. Deanna. The reporter. The detective. Anne Lucas. Elizabeth Vidal. Corrine. Giroux.<br /><br />People are complaining that the book's been stretched. Well, there are so much happening. And with everything that's happening, Gideon and Eva are still the major part of it. And since I love love Gideon, the more the better and I'm not complaining. Looking forward to more and more of Gideon!!! &lt;3

B00BU2SIW4|5.0|I grow up with this group, and have every single CD. It is very hard for me these days to find a music with some decent vocabulary, or an original like this group.
B001KZG99A|1.0|I rented this movie for my son and I to watch.  The entire time it was constantly connecting and it wasn't my internet connection.<br />So disappointed waste of money.  I love amazon but super bummed.
0425263924|3.0|I've waited a day to write my review thinking I'd feel a bit different.  Not so. I, like many others, could not wait for this book to come out.  The delayed release was frustrating but it increased the anticipation of what was to come.  Not taking in account that I thought this was the last of the series, the book was boring.  I love that Gideon and Eva have sex ALL THE TIME but it was like reading the same story in different settings.  When I was about 90-100 pages in, I kept thinking, \\"when is something going to happen\\"????  To find anything that was exciting didn't happen until the last 30 pages and even that left little to be desired!!  A lot of what was within this story may be substantial in upcoming books.  I hope so as the ramblings about Megumi was the worst for me.  I love Cary's story, but the rest of them?  Don't care. It did not live up to my expectation considering this series ranked up to the \\"best I've ever read\\".  To boot....$9.99 is a hefty price.  I understand SD has no control but I've read $.99 books that were more exciting than this one.  I give it 3 stars as I whole-heartedly believe that SD will prevail and not let her readers down.  I have faith and will give her one more shot!!!!  I've invested $30 and my time into this story.  I won't give up now.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|...I looked at many others, even tried a couple, but no other truly worked the way I wanted... thanks Feedly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. It's very Similar to Temple Run. The only issue I have is that once the update took place for Miami I can no longer access my Facebook account through the game. I don't know if it's a Kindle fire issue or just a personal issue<br />But even though I can't compete with my friends I love the game
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I was impressed with the accuracy and portrayal of realistic events.  Chris was a genuine American Hero and will be sorely missed
B00A14V0MM|5.0|I had to watch this movie at least a 5 times, so touching to see just about how fare a family would go. Truly a Hollywood work where there are always &#34;happy&#34; ending. This is a must have in my movie collection.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|kinda easy though love soooooooooooo much!!! i think it should have a little more difficult  its beast and boss thin
B005K17RU0|3.0|I tried this as the first of my weather programs on my Kindle.  I had this one on my phone but wanted to be able to see more details.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|One good tip received during the movie:  Never tell your woman you are taking Viagra--it says that right on the label.
0307352153|5.0|This book is so important and should be required meeting for teachers (of all ages), employers, and parents.  In fact I think everyone should read it since we all encounter introverts and extroverts in our lives.  Cain is not &#34;bashing&#34; extroverts as I have heard some people say.  She is explaining introverts and why we need BOTH types of people in our society.  Cain writes in an easily digestible way avoiding too much diagnostic or scientific language.
B000FCJZ4K|4.0|Overall this was a great book. That being said I think it comes up short in two key areas.<br />1- the analogies and examples are sometimes dated, laughable or flat out weird.<br />2- I have studied value networking before and this books doesn't go as deep into it as I would have liked in terms of actual strategies, tactics and techniques. It covers the general  philosophy well but leaves wanting in ways to actually implement it.<br />That being said it does  have some very interesting points and tips that I didint expect, and if you apply what the book says you will no doubt improve your life and become more successful in every meaningful way.<br />Overall a recommend book, its just not the classic I expected it to be.
0385360169|4.0|I am listening to the story again. The first time I rushed it. Now I am relaxing to take it all in. I can't wait till the next audiobook arrives.
0792839749|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter to watch. She's only 1-year old but she loves watching the little kids on it and listening to the music. Glad I got it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I had tried another clock for my Kindle and was disappointed in the function.  This one seems to have everything I need.
1616550414|5.0|What about my first book of the game more immersive world? Incredible is the minimum. I love looking at the artworks and erasures development, beyond the details left behind who are very curious. If you're a fan of the series, need to buy.
0425263924|1.0|There is nothing to this book. Literally nothing to it. Where are the chacracters I love so much! Shame on you Sylvia Day!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great little app, the calculator fill the whole screen, no bug or problems. If it had a trig function I would love it.
1451626088|5.0|So I've read the entire series of the Cousins War by Philippa Gregory and I LOVED each and every one!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have read the whole series and loved them all but this was a huge disappointment and a horrible ending to the series
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I chose it after trying the one from AccuWeather.  I needed more information dealing with current weather changes as I live in a very windy area.
0802798225|5.0|I really loveddd this book. I really thought it'd be pretty predictable, but it really wasn't. I totally couldn't put it down. It had just the right amount of mushy love scenes. And the characters actually interacted the way that fit. I also think the pace was perfect. Overall was a very enjoyable book!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was awesome, super hot and sexy, Gideon was AMAZING. This was my favorite from the series, I totally recommended.
B00AO2ZMB6|5.0|I started watching The Shield in 2013, unaware of the fact that it debuted in 2002. That being said, this show kept me glued through all 7 seasons and is one of the best cop/crime shows I've seen.  Another plus is that if you watch this now, you're bound to see a lot of familiar faces; The Shield has seen some great actors cross its set. So stop reading this review and start watching already.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|This game is pretty amazing but you can only play 5 world's then you have to pay .99 more it was fun though I finished world 1-5 in a couple hours could not put it down
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Love this series on TV and wanted to keep it.  Amazon has the best rates for movies and TV so here I am again, and now I'm waiting for the price of the 4th season to come down.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|As usual, another incredible story. Hated it to end. Planning on reading the next one, whenever that gets done. Recommended.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Just finshed the book.  It was okay ... but no way as good as the first two.  Two many little stories left hanging... and I am VERY VERY upset with the way the book ended.<br /><br />Will we have to wait another six months to a year for the conclusion???
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Enjoy this game a lot.  Good quality game. Is fun and thoughtful. If you like puzzles, this one rocks.  Going to play this often.
B007WFR0QS|2.0|Did not separate herself from so many other sounding artists with this same type of genre.  Very disappointed didn't expect Amy Winehouse or Adele but pretty plain.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Enjoyed this book, easy reading and very fast paced... Can't wait for the next one! worth the time to read
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved it!  I would have loved it to be longer. I didn't like how it eneded. I'm so curious how the next book is going to be.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I was very pleased with this app, I found that it gives a lot of options and versatility in mixing exactly what I like to listen to. I have noticed some apps seem to drain the battery far faster on my Kindle Fire, but this ran for hours with very little impact. Sound is smooth and has a wonderful quality. Well worth the price.
1601251505|5.0|A very nice roleplaying book. The art is great, the rules are comprehensive and it really takes 3.5 a step further. The only drawback I can see is that, by joining the traditional Player's handbook & Dungeon Master's guide in a single book, it's a big too bulky and heavy.
B0035G1K7S|5.0|The last official DVD of a White Stripes live performance.  There Canadian tour was well documented in this DVD with many behind the scenes interviews, as well as, a scenic look of Canada.  If you are a White Stripes fan this is a piece of history and an excellent representation of the White Stripes at the top of their game.  Enjoy!
B0096BIENY|3.0|Their voices are exceptional but thought there would be more English version songs was wrong. Would like to see them put out a version that was all English.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I wish we had more series like this on tv - exciting and thought provoking and clean.  Compared to what's on tv today, this is absolutely refreshing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great detail and insight not only into the killing of bin laden, but into the making and life of a Navy Seal.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Stop reading reviews and just buy it! It worth every dolar!!!!  Graphics, music, sound, characters... just perfect! I played several RPG and JRPG but this one is special one.
B006ANJ4BW|4.0|Done up very well for a remake my kind of movie lots of action.. Vaguely follows the Arnold version from way back but stands on its own as good in my books..
B00A2AU0KI|1.0|If you are a baseball fan, you will hate this movie.  It is apparently an attempt to counter Moneyball and the idea that baseball can be figured out by analyzing stats.  It stars a grizzled old scout who, even though he has gone blind, can hear how good a batter is by the swish of his bat from hundreds of feet away.  His rival is a stat geek, using a newfangled computer thingy to try to scout players.  Of course in the end the old scout is a genius and the computer geek is wrong.  And how do they know he's wrong?  Because the guy his computer told him to draft swung and missed 4 times in his first batting practice with the team!  (Clearly showing he's a terrible hitter, because of course top hitters get a home run 100% of the time).
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno is different and unique his sound is full, different and soulful in many ways.  He reminds me of the uniqueness when John Legend first came on the scene some harsh language not needed but todays youth feels differently, still very good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Helps keep me busy and makes me work my mind!<br />I would tell all my friends about it and encourage them to get it.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This by far was the best game made for kindle fire HD yet keep up good work game loft ever made just great so epic
030759565X|3.0|While I've used many recipes from Smitten Kitchen from their online website, I found the recipes to be only ok....
B004FHP9KA|4.0|This flick took the whole invading someone's dreams to a thrilling level. Must say kept me interested to the end ths cast was great even Leonardo I am not hids biggest fan but I watch.. This one makes one wonder what the capabilities of the mind are.. note I rarely rate 5 stars has to really grab me so 4 is really enjoyed
1400052173|5.0|I have found this book extremly interesting.  I had no idea how the use of tissue came about.  I have used it in class to discuss bioethical questions.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this excerpt form Gideon and Eva's world. I picked it up and couldn't put it down and less than 24hours after I started it I am once again waiting for the sequel to how Gideon and Eva's story will continue.<br /><br />There is a whole lot of OMG's & WTH? In this book and once you start you won't be able to put this steamer down. Sometimes.....it was even too hot to handle! Get the series and you will fall in love with Gideon and Eva and all their obsessive behaviors. It has a fiftish flare to it but still holds it own in a totally different category. Unique and I recommend it for all this steamy too hot to handle romance lovers.
B008J34466|5.0|always great but there is a song on here that is so un-like her usual forceful style where you really hear what a beautiful voice she has
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have read several sequels to romance novels so far this year and although I am disappointed with the ending of this book, this sequel was by far the best out there. Although I had to wait much longer than I would have liked for this sequel to be released, it terms of steaminess, Silvia didn't disappoint.  She managed to continue to bring the sex scenes to new heights which kept it interesting and hot, all while displaying how Eva and Gideon's relationship was continuing to deepen.  This book definately got my adrenaline flowing with all of the twists and turns and I was definately on the edge of my seat waiting for what was going to happen next.  This is the first review I have written but I felt compelled to write it as I definately do not think that this book deserves all of the terrible 1 star reviews it has been getting.  I am stoked that there is going to be more books to follow.  I also liked that this book happens in \\"real-time\\" and therefore since not much time has elapsed since Reflected in You, she didnt artifically just end the story with a HEA that would have felt just rushed and not at all true to the rest of the story and the nature of Gideon and Eva's relationship.  However, I do wish that the ending had more of a punch than it did.  I almost felt that Silvia (or her editors/publishers) didn't know where this book should stop and the next one should start, so they just drew an arbitrary line in the sand and ended it abruptly, which left me feeling robbed!  Bottom line is that I will purchase the remaining books as I need to see where Gideon and Eva's relationship goes and if you are looking for a HOT summer romance read, this will not disappoint!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I just love a good Hero's journey tale.  And Pixar really knows how to stimulate the eye when it comes to scenery and digital animation style.  What a deal!
B000W93CHC|4.0|Enjoyed this sequel better than Pillars! It is definitely a long read, but worth it. By the end of the book you feel entwined with the characters.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|Soon after George Miller's \\"Mad Max\\" and \\"The Road Warrior\\" burst onto the cinematic landscape in the early `80s, they ushered in a whole new genre of thrillers where warring gangs ruled the roads, fighting for gasoline and whatever scraps of food were left behind by scavengers. Many of those imitators have been (deservedly) forgotten as the years have passed, yet the MAD MAX TRILOGY itself remains a favorite of fans, with Miller's brilliantly edited set-pieces keeping viewers enthralled despite the familiar settings of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.<br /><br />Warner Home Video's newly-released Blu-Ray box-set of the \\"Mad Max Trilogy\\" offers - in a single, three-disc Blu-Ray case (housed inside a slightly unattractive oversized tin) - a reprise of MGM's original \\"Mad Max\\" BD; a new AVC encode of \\"The Road Warrior,\\" premiering here with a DTS MA soundtrack; and the HD debut of the third film in the series, \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.\\"<br /><br />The original MAD MAX finds Mel Gibson launching his career as a tough cop in a world where unhinged loonies - including Hugh Keays-Byrne as the nefarious \\"Toecutter\\" - attack unsuspecting motorists and innocent civilians. Max's battles with his own bosses - desperately hoping to keep \\"heroes\\" on the road - are contrasted with the violent attacks of the gangs, and once Max's partner is killed and his wife and child targeted by the thugs, Max turns from desperation to anger in a soon-to-be-post-apocalyptic society quickly spiraling out of control.<br /><br />Though \\"Mad Max\\"'s world is only semi-futuristic compared to the films that followed, it's still a bleak, and captivating, environment that Miller captured on-screen - particularly considering the era in which the movie was originally released. The various car chases and action sequences deliver the goods, and while the picture - penned by Miller and producer Byron Kennedy from James McCausland's original story - isn't as compelling or tightly packaged as the film's immediate sequel, the original \\"Mad Max\\" remains one of the most important productions to originate Down Under. The picture ignited Gibson and Miller's respective careers, single-handedly ushered in a whole genre of similarly-themed cash-ins, and along with the works of Peter Weir, announced the Aussie film industry as a major player in world cinema.<br /><br />It's also a movie that's perpetually had to shake off a nagging reputation that it's inferior to its sequel - something not helped by the fact that many of us originally saw the film second, after \\"The Road Warrior\\" was released, and usually in lousy TV prints at that. With its widescreen Todd-AO dimensions cropped, and its original Aussie dialogue dubbed by Samuel Arkoff's American-International, it's no wonder \\"Mad Max\\" came off for many years as the weaker sibling compared to \\"The Road Warrior.\\" Still, taken on its own terms as an appetizer before the main course, and with its technical trappings restored, it's an involving, memorable picture with striking directorial choices.<br /><br />MGM's Blu-Ray here boasts the same exact presentation as its prior BD release. The 1080p AVC encoded transfer offers an appreciable enhancement over its decade-old Special Edition DVD, limited only by the occasional griminess of its source materials, while most of the potent extras from that release have been carried over, including a 25-minute retrospective documentary and an insightful audio commentary featuring cinematographer David Eggby, Jon Dowding, Tim Ridge and Chris Murray. These extras, along with the U.S. trailers, are on-hand, plus a remixed DTS MA soundtrack of the original Aussie dialogue and Brian May's occasionally bombastic score (the American-International U.S. dubbed track is also included in its original mono).<br /><br />One of the best looking Blu-Ray catalog releases, \\"Max\\"'s sequel, THE ROAD WARRIOR, has now been surpassed by a remastered Warner Blu-Ray that's even better than its predecessor, though moreso for an augmented audio track than its slightly enhanced visuals.<br /><br />Gibson returns here as a more haunted, grizzled Max, with the world now completed dominated by punks while bands of humanity attempt to survive in the wasteland. Miller, Terry Hayes and Brian Hannant's script works in elements of classic westerns like \\"Shane\\" as Max reluctantly bands together with the survivors - including Bruce Spence's Gyro Captain - to ward off the villains.<br /><br />\\"The Road Warrior\\" has always been one of my favorite films of the early `80s - an improvement on the original \\"Mad Max\\" in every way (from Miller's direction to Gibson's performance and Brian May's more sophisticated, richer score) and a driving, thrilling piece of sci-fi action that's never been duplicated in its genre. Its straightforward story, lack of extraneous dialogue and subplots, emphasis on the pursuit and energy of its chase sequences, and the brilliant editing and choreography of those set-pieces makes it an all-time classic - a movie that stands alone from its bookending pictures as a spectacular piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />Working from the original negative, \\"The Road Warrior\\" looked great on the prior Blu-Ray and has been improved by superior AVC encoding here, though in general, the two transfers look roughly the same. As with before, Dean Semler's rugged, atmospheric cinematography is enhanced by high-def, with eye-popping colors and detailed textures on-hand at every turn; it's a dazzling transfer of a film that demands to be seen this way, or not at all. The audio here also receives an upgrade with a lossless DTS MA mix (the prior Blu-Ray's audio was rendered as a basic 5.1 Dolby Digital track) that rumbles with bass and a superb soundstage for May's musical output.<br /><br />The disc otherwise is identical to the original Blu-Ray, with a pair of exclusive-to-HD extras included: a commentary track with George Miller and Dean Semler, along with a brief introduction from Leonard Maltin that puts the movie into the context of its other series films, plus the original trailer.<br /><br />The worldwide success of \\"The Road Warrior\\" - and in particular its breakthrough performance at the U.S. box-office in 1982 - lead to another sequel, this time augmented by a larger budget afforded by its predecessor's commercial success.<br /><br />Deciding to go in something of a different direction, George Miller opted to turn MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME into something of a more \\"emotional\\" piece less driven by violence and high-octane set-pieces. Miller and writer Terry Hayes took a cue from Max's arc in \\"The Road Warrior\\" and turned him into a slightly more charismatic, \\"Man With No Name\\" sort here, with Max stumbling into a post-apocalyptic village named \\"Bartertown.\\" There, a political struggle ensues between leader Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) and the diminutive \\"Master\\" (Angelo Rossitto), who's the only one (apparently) who understands how to produce methane to power the town. Aunty strikes a deal with Max to knock off Master's physical bodyguard \\"Blaster,\\" but circumstances eventually send Max off into the wasteland again, where he finds a \\"Lord of the Flies\\" type community of youngsters waiting for the messianic \\"Captain Walker\\" to return.<br /><br />Miller co-directed \\"Thunderdome\\" with associate George Ogilvie, something that might explain the uneven pacing of this more ambitious, though decidedly least successful, of the \\"Mad Max\\" series. There are a pair of dynamite set-pieces on-hand when Max takes to the Thunderdome to battle the hulking Blaster, and Miller caps the film with one last, stirring chase with Max and the young refugees trying to escape from Aunty's gang on a train. As potent as these moments are, however, they're surrounded by a meandering mid-section where Max finds the castoff children, who look as if they've come out of the William Golding novel by way of the Ewoks in \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" Their society isn't nearly as developed as it should've been, and for a group of naive youngsters who presumably haven't encountered anything of the punk-driven outside world, why one of them actually drops an f-bomb when they re-enter Bartertown is patently nonsensical.<br /><br />There's also an obvious lack of energy in \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\\" at times. The thrilling, fast-paced intensity of the earlier films is replaced here with a more deliberately paced fantasy approach, and for fans of \\"The Road Warrior,\\" this PG-13 rated, decidedly less violent picture can be (and has often been written off as) a shock to the system. Even the production design of Bartertown seems uninspired, employing a \\"Temple of Doom\\"-like aesthetic that makes you think Mola Ram is going to pop out at any second.<br /><br />Still, there are assorted pleasures to be found: Gibson exudes more of his natural charisma here, and this decidedly \\"looser\\" Max feels like a natural progression of the hardened warrior who rediscovered his humanity at the end of \\"The Road Warrior.\\" Dean Semler's wide scope cinematography is once again stylish, and Turner brings sufficient life to her scenes as a scavenger who's recreated herself as the leader of Bartertown (\\"he's just a raggedy man!\\"). What's more, Maurice Jarre's glorious orchestral score helps to smooth over some of the picture's rough passages - with its sweeping scale and melodic interludes, \\"Thunderdome\\" is one of Jarre's strongest efforts from one of his most prolific periods (his marvelous \\"Enemy Mine\\" score would follow just a few months later). In fact, the climactic, 12-minute chase cue has to rank as one of Jarre's greatest in his esteemed career.<br /><br />Although it's a definite comedown from \\"The Road Warrior,\\" \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\\" is an admirable attempt at tweaking the formula established by its predecessors. Miller even manages to craft a surprisingly moving epilogue for the film as well, paying tribute to his late associate - producer Byron Kennedy - as the movie fades out and brings the original \\"Mad Max\\" trilogy to an emotionally satisfying close.<br /><br />With only the theatrical trailer as an extra, \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\\"'s Blu-Ray debut comes in the form of a highly detailed 1080p AVC encoded transfer. The DTS MA soundtrack packs an impressive punch when Jarre's score takes center stage, though it's unfortunate his final cue was dialed in so low in the original mix.<br /><br />With Miller having completed filming on \\"Mad Max: Fury Road\\" (apparently due for release sometime in 2014), it'll be interesting to see how the eclectic filmmaker - who hasn't directed a live-action film not aimed at children in 20 years - returns to the film series he's most remembered for.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|There are scenes I would not want a little one to view. The movie moves slowly, so you have to be in the mood for that and fantasy thoughts mixed into real... I am surprised it won Academy awards... but the scenes are beautiful.
B00846REIS|5.0|Who doesn't love a love story?!! To be in love the way they are,different but at the end all they want is each other!! Great read in just 3 days!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS FEEKIN AMENS :-)<br /><br />AMAZING.  AMAZING  AMAZING.  AMAZING  LOVE.  THIS.  GAME<br /><br />AMENS I TELL U LOVE IT  BEST  GAME.  IN.  THE.  WORLD
0618918248|5.0|I loved this book; I do believe the author most certainly will succeed in his goal of converting religious apologists through the clear, clean fashion in which he describes evolution and indeed every subject in this book.<br />Thought-provoking and gorgeously written; this book is very readable and quite addictive.<br />A great read for anyone with or with religious doubts and also for anyone who wants to learn more about how evolution works.<br />I would also highly recommend God or Godless by John Loftus and Randal Rauser and any and everything by Mr. Dawkins.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I really don't like books where you have to buy multiple books to get to the end.  When I see a book with good reviews, if it has more than one other book, I normally won't buy it.<br /><br />I bought this series when I saw book two was coming out a few days after I purchased book one.  Figured I could wait a few days.  I really thought the wait between the second and third was too long to wait.  You have to re-read the first two to get back into the whole story.  I waited for the third to see what finally happened to Gideon and Eva but was EXTREMELY upset to read all the reviews about there being TWO more books AFTER the third.  If she would have let us know this from the start, I NEVER would have started this series!!!!!!  I guess she was never taught what TRILOGY means.....3!!!!!!<br /><br />Anyway, saying that, I did read this story.  I was just ok.  There isn't that much of a story line.  You would think after waiting that long this story would be great....well it wasn't.  It seemed like she just filled with with sex, sex, sex....come on.....we get it by the third book, they have sex and a lot of it.  Get a story in there.  Why does there need to be practically entire chapters that are about a sexual encounter.<br /><br />Also, why did she make Cary so annoying in this book.  In the last two, I really liked him, in this one....he was getting on my nerves!<br /><br />I wish writers would stop filling books with sex and start actually writing a book with a story line.  I also hopes she reconsiders TWO more books and just finished it with one....also make the price a bit cheaper for what she did to all of her fans.  $9.99 is WAY too much for this story especially on kindle.....come one!!!!!!
B008JJM88Q|4.0|I picked up this game up as the faotd.<br /><br />I was leery downloading this app due to one permission listed in the permissions:  \\"Access the list of accounts in the Accounts Service\\".  After reviewing the Amazon description/help page regarding permissions, I realized that Amazon is just as vague when it comes to describing permissions as politicians are when answering direct questions.  Maybe Amazon will update their help page on that someday.<br /><br />I am not sure how the mechanics work with this application but it left me, and the rest of my close family, bewildered as to how Akinator was able to figure out who we were thinking of.  Probably the most enjoyment and laughter I experienced was when my daughter started playing around with the game.  Her reactions of disbelief in the abilities of Akinator's perfect guessing of some of the most obscure people/characters had both my wife and I laughing hysterically in another room, from where we were able to hear her frustrations.  Definately a lot of fun can be had from this game.  Although I'm not sure about the longevity of the application's use for adults however it might offer teens and tweens a lot of fun for a while when they are together or alone.<br /><br />I found only one minor error when playing and that was it guessed an actor's character name instead of their real name.  But this only occurred once.<br /><br />I would have rated this game 5 stars, but the one permission required and the pricing.  Since I don't really see this game lasting over a few weeks on your Kindle, I see no reason for the developer wanting more than a buck.<br /><br />Works without any issues on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9
B00CATSONE|5.0|Awesome, did not know if I would like this book, but turned out to be a very good book.<br />  Thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thisis a very enjoyable game. However you have to be careful because it is very addictive. I find myself playing on my lunch break also in my bed even though I am sleepy.
1623420148|4.0|I loved this book. The story drew me in and did not let me go till the end and even then, I needed more.<br /><br />Emma chase has created a world that is inviting and characters that you cant help but fall in love with. the story moves smoothly from beginning to end.<br /><br />I was disappointed when I got to the end of the book. I cannot wait to read the continuation and see what happens.<br /><br />Emma chase is an excellent author and story teller and I cant wait to see what the future holds.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Every time I get close to 3000 coins i suddenly lose all my coins and start back at zero. I really like the game but I cannot upgrade anymore so I will be un installing until this is fixed.
B001R0XNSI|5.0|Yes! If your going to carry a marker, make it this one. Its built like a brick ? house! Even if you don't carry a marker, start carrying this one.
0307271080|5.0|Chimamanda is an extraordinary writet, for Americanah is not your average run of the mill sloppy romance story. I urge you to park yourself in your favorite reading spot and lose yourself in the strong and believable characters of Ifemelu and Obinze.  Chimamanda will make you laugh, and ponder. Her writing encourages you to question your views and perhaps even open your eyes to blackness, kinky hair and being an African in American.<br />I loved every second that I was reading Americanah. I lost myself in the lives of the so many each one alive and etched into my memory bank.<br />A wonderful read that I will treasure and re-read again and again.
0143119680|3.0|Mix supernatural creatures - vampires and witches - with extensive historical references and you have brewed my perfect cup of literary tea. In other words, I liked it. I'm not sure it would suit some of my more discerning fellow bibliophiles, but it did it for me. If you don't like sappy love stories, supernatural cliches, and history this is probably not the book for you.<br /><br />What I don't like about the book is the trite love story. I enjoy a good love story, but would prefer something a little more original and not quite so formulaic. I would also have liked to see a bad ass vampire, instead of the standard vampire with a heart of gold. He can be redeemed; he just needs to be genuinely bad for a while.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the read and will be starting the sequel tonight.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is already one of my favorite series.  So I enjoy it very much.  My husband watches it with me<br />and keeps up pretty well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Listen I need the update for kindle. I have waited three months notch three months I can not wait much longer. I'm dying of anticipation it is out on IOS why not amazon Kindle. I'm counting on you Notch I Believe in you dude. I have to have this update. This game is my life. I can't wait much longer.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|While I do enjoy season 1 and 2, there are some stinkers in those seasons. Season 3 is really where the show takes off. Consistent stories that are very well done,  but everyone knows this.<br /><br />The picture is AMAZING, words don't do it justice. the sound, if you have a good system will also blow you away.<br /><br />A real easy way to descibe the picture. I was eating breakfast with my 12 year old yesterday and one of the TNG episodes (Sarek, happens to be in season 3) was on TV. Off hand, he commented that it looked really bad and it didnt have a lot of detail compared to the BLURAY version I had bought. It seems a lot of people forget the VHS video quality this originally aired in. These versions are superior in every way.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I loved every single episode of the season 10 especially the ones that told us more of the character's lives before they came to NCIS. This is by far the best season of NCIS!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was a blast never to difficult but far to short.  I can't wait for more. So hurry up and feed the monkey already.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The Quell series is the only game I haven't deleted from my Kindle! It's such a great value for the money spent, with such a great story line too!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love this series, the era, the costumes of that time and the history of it all. Victorian times captivates me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I play it on pc and Xbox also, I was disappointed when I had to reset my kindle fire and I lost my world with diamonds. Otherwise it's great
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I LIKE TC-S MOVIE AND EACH ONE GET BETTER THAN THE LAST ONE  AND I THINK IT DESERVES A 5 START RATING
B008XG1X18|5.0|Everywhere I went I kept hearing &#34;I saw it on Pintrest&#34; or &#34;I copied it from Pintrest&#34;. Now I am the person saying these things. I recently bought a new home and have used the DIY category so many times I've lost count. Not only have I found great, unique things that I can make myself but I have also learned how to do home repairs, gardening, etc. One of my most used apps.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Not thrilled with the ending. I usually devour books in a day. This took me 3. I just was 't that into it and wanted to be.
0425263924|1.0|The ending of this book made me more mad than the ending of the Sopranos series!!! What type of ending was that it? it was so bad! I sped reading through this book hoping and praying with each turn of the page on my kindle that something exciting what happened...... Then the ending happened! Epic fail!! The only two Semi-interesting scenes (spoiler Alert) in this whole horrible book were When Corinne tried to kiss Gideon and when Gideon finally popped the question (half assed I might mention)..... Whoops almost forgot Almost every scene with Eva's father were perfect, to when he finally found out about Nathan to him getting caught screwing Eva's mother. &lt;--- Those scenes were great! Other than that this book was trash I am so mad I waited so long to finally get the third book! but I will say Ms. day making it five books instead of three might be the thing that safes her, but then again she pissed all a lot of people off with this Horrible book!
B009AMANBA|3.0|its a pretty slow movie my husband had a hard time staying focused but the period and era were captured well.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's okay but it's not my favorite game because it can get really boring... It's kind of like a kiddy game if you know what I mean.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|Loved the 3d version, it pops and zings all over the screen. The effects are awesome, the upgrading of the story line is excellent, I would (did) rent this in a heartbeat-not a chick flick but like Van Helsing it's a thrill ride a minute!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|bought the G155 gaming system and I love it. it has not disappointed me. it has been really convenient and have not have anything negative to say about this product. I highly recommend it for children or like me I travel a lot so I use it at the hotels, since I room-mate most of the time.
0385508476|5.0|Collects all of Anne Frank's writings in one place, prints the three versions of the diary so that one can make comparisons easily, and contains an exhaustive history/background to the diary. The ultimate Anne Frank resource
B00992CF6W|4.0|great but i would like for it to be able to update like the apple products and the 0.7.0 came out but not for us and im thinking of trading my kindle for an i pad because kindle gets apps way way way after they come out and some apps are only for apple
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was honestly my favorite book in the series! It had moments of light heartedness, yet still contained so many heart wrenching moments that left me crying, chewing on my fingernails and even feeling a little bit envious of Gideon and Eva's love. It was awesome seeing Gideon and Eva grow in this, almost as if they have in fact grown and are learning from their previous mistakes with one another. And honestly, despite what other readers have said about being disappointed in the fact that the story isn't finished....I'm excited its not! Gideon and Eva are too complex, have come so far yet have so much further to go with themselves, their demons and their love for it to be over yet! I'm excited to see where they go, how Cary handles his life and how the rest of their story unfolds, even if it takes one or two more books to get there! Sylvia has created a real, honest to goodness couple who has real issues and real demons, who have fought and continue to fight for their happily ever after ....I know I'm in it until the end and I can guarentee we will NOT be disappointed!!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|i think this game is fabulous i love it i love i lov  it i think yall should download this game it coute my attention :))
0802473156|5.0|This book is very easy to read, and it has tests to help you determine your love language...which is basically what you need to feel loved.  I think if a couple were to read it together it could help them find a greater level of happiness, and for those of us that are single or divorced, it's always good to become more self aware while dating.  It has helped me to communicate what I need and to discern and ask others what they need to feel loved.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Good story. I did not like how it ended. Now we have to wait until the next book to find out what happens to Gideon and Eva. I don't like Brett at all. Gideon needs to whip that tail again. I hope the author does not make us wait long.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|No! No! No! No! I really enjoyed the third of the Crossfire novels.  Now it's finished.  Sylvia was again able to capture my attention with the interresting relationship between Gideon and Eva! But their relationship continue to grow dispite the difficulties! Keep on going!! I can't wait for the next chapter of their lifes! Thank you!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game sounds like tons of fun. But it wont download. jfif fifjjf fijjf fiif. ciiif iiif iiif. inf. inf niijf
B004EYT932|3.0|I give this book five stars for content.  I found it very interting and thought provoking.  We always convince ourselves that this time it is going to be different but when when dealing with human traits (buy/sell/hold decisions fall into this category) it is never different. People haven't changed since we started roaming the planet, so why we expect things to be different is amazing.<br /><br />The content is a bit intellectual, which isn't bad per se. Maybe because I mainly read before bed, I found it took more concentration to follow then the typical finance/economics stuff I read.<br /><br />I give this book one star for its Kindle Paperwhite presentation.  There are many charts and graphs supporting the text and they are very difficult to read, mainly due to contrast and shades of gray rendering. Perhaps on a color Kindle like Fire this won't be a problem but on the Paperwhite, it is a disaster.  If you own a Paperwhite or probably any non-color Kindle, I would avoid buying this book. I feel I wasted my money.<br /><br />While the charts/graphs are not critical to understanding the points he makes, they are copious and not having them to ponder as you read makes the book less fun.<br /><br />I recommend the book(content), just not the Paperwhite presentation.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I lovvvvvve this game but some times it can get boring if you play it all the time..<br />Get the game trust me u`ll love it.
B004XQO90O|4.0|Good movie.  It arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  The acting was good and there is plenty of excitement and suspense in this sci-fi thriller.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun to play at all times.<br />It constantly has new places to play<br />And you can compete against your friends
B00992CF6W|3.0|I've read that furnaces don't work, but all you have to do is break the furnace to get the items that are smelting. Amazon, pleas  try to get updates on the same day as Apple and android markets. This game is amazing and you should buy it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app because it has such a large range of difficulty and you don't need 20 min to play it like some apps
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Amazing movie, best LOTR yet, as far as detail goes. A really great movie to watch! Would recommend to anybody.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This album, in my opinion, presents a more mature, sincere, emotionally compelling, and complex variety of music than any of Queens of the Stone Age's previous works. It makes me very happy to see them growing to be (even more) effective songwriters. Even with the massive amount of hype surrounding ...Like Clockwork, all of my expectations were exceeded.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|A very enjoyable film that features some of the best super-hero casting yet. A must-see if you enjoy comic books or action movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The update came out on apple and I got it on my I pod but I have cooler worlds on my kindle! Please update
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Chose this backpack over all the others Amazon carries because of so many positive reviews.  After nearly two weeks of daily use in the Greek Islands and other Mediterranean locations found it to be roomy, comfortable to carry, and allows easy access to my equipment.
1451695195|5.0|Deeply within us we know that everything in this book is true, it is not hell or heaven, we are here to learn, to learn how to love and to pay our karmic debt, not in a revenge way but just for us to learn that it is no savior who will take our sins. Bring love to earth, first to yourself and after to any other soul. You are not alone you are loved you always have been loved, you just can't see it.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|This mouse charger is easy to use, convenient and I get no more &#34;Low Batteries&#34; messages to disturb my web browsing!
0425263991|5.0|What an amazingly well written book. Kaleb didn't disappoint at all. I love Nalini Singh's writing. Everything is fresh and new with each book. Normally at this stage in a series, books seem a little recycled. But not the psy-changeling books (or the Angel series either).<br />Loved getting a small update on Mercy and her pupcubs!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome for real its a great way to pass time you start getting super caught up in it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like temple run you will love subway surfers. I love the game myself and I think you will to.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This was a very high quality film, very artistically done. The only issue I had with it, was that it seemed to never get started. By the time it seemed to have gotten started, it was over. It was somewhat unsatisfying.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I haven't played the original so this version is difficult for me. Graphics are great. I do recommend this game.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|100% awesome game,graphics are terrific &amp; controls are so simple..best tennis game ever &amp; love to play this any &amp; every time I can...
B0090KZDSK|3.0|Ugh. I feel so conflicted about this book. I'm going to apologize in advance, I'm fairly certain this is going to be mostly rambling, because I've been thinking about this since yesterday, and I'm no closer to any coherent thoughts.<br /><br />I loved book one. It's SO not my usual shtick, but I was completely enthralled with this overwhelmingly obsessive, codependent, seemingly unhealthy love/ lust relationship between Gideon and Eva. It was like the tsunami of relationships, and instead of fighting it, I just enjoyed being pulled under.<br /><br />Book two was a lesson in frustration. Relationship patterns from the first book continued (Eva running every time she was upset and Gideon shutting down and shutting her out instead of communicating). It drove me up a wall and back down. Then there was Eva's insecurity, which Gideon fed, and then seemed miffed when she didn't just trust him. The lashing out, the secrets. It just seemed to be a lot more pain than love being dished out on both sides. I felt better about it at the end, when the &#34;mystery&#34; was solved, but in reality, not a whole lot happened in this book to move them forward.<br /><br />So, here we are. Book three. The book I thought was going to be our conclusion.<br /><br />I liked that there seemed to be some genuine growth in Eva and Gideon's relationship. Eva finally stops running (for the most part) which was huge for me, since that drove me insane.<br /><br />Gideon however does not learn his lesson about shutting her out, which still drives me crazy. He keeps setting up these scenarios (or letting things happen), and expects her to trust him and not let her insecurities get the best of her.<br /><br />Now, to a certain extent, I get it. He killed a man for her, so that should prove his devotion beyond a shadow of a doubt, but it doesn't. Right or wrong, she still feels insecure (and playing Devils advocate, I can see where your boyfriend possibly getting caught as a murderer could keep you ontender hooks about your relationships long term viability.) But Gideon, for all his flashes of amazing insight into her motivations, (like knowing she kissed Brett because she wanted him to know how she felt about Corrine, when she didn't even seem to realize it) keeps playing into her worries. You know, it's like that definition of insanity...doing the same thing, but expecting different results...<br /><br />So, for the first half of the book, I'm sorta happy that there is SOME movement in their relationship, (because with two more books, there is a possibility that we could just keep doing the same 'ol same 'ol for at least 600 more pages, and that might have just driven me over the edge.). But really, I'm feeling like maybe I'm just learning to be happy with crumbs? It's hard for me to tell. Oh, but I was NOT excited about the &#34;progress&#34; they were making with their physical relationship (you didn't think there could be &#34;progress&#34;? Yeah, me either. )<br /><br />Then, in the second half, we get some interesting tidbits, and lots of side plots are thrown out there.<br />But then nothing happens, with any of them. We are just left holding a whole bag of possibilities.<br /><br />It's not a cliffhanger any more then the first or second were cliffhangers. But for me, it just felt...unfinished.<br /><br />I know a lot of people will love this book, and I get it. What was there, I really really, liked. I felt better about Gideon and Eva as a couple, and I was happy to see the story line branch out beyond just their relationship. At the same time, I get the people who feel like the storyline is being purposefully dragged over more books then is necessary.<br /><br />So, yeah, that's where I'm at. Conflicted. Maybe forever :). I will say, I am hooked. Even if I'm annoyed, I want to see this through to the end. I hope it's spectacular. I also will say this is the last time I'm going to jump on this on release day. Next time this will be borrow, not buy book.
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|I have watched the first 4 at least 5 times each, have a friend I give movies like this.First 15 min. are just gratuitous violence by motor vehicle. Dialog was about 60% Russian with sub titles so small they were impossible to read and they flashed so fast a speed reader whold have had a hard time. All told this movie really sucked big time.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed finishing the trilogy. I was an interesting look at a dystopian society, I didn't feel that it added anything new in this field. Light reading. Beach book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's one of the funnest games I've ever played! Everything seems perfect about it. It's not one of those games where you collect all your money clean up the trash then you have nothing to do on that game. You can ace on the dragon track! Well once you get to level 15, which isn't very hard to get to.
B002B554TO|5.0|Plays well, no scratches! I've played it like a thousand times! I suggest you but it, you won't regret it.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Exciting from start to finish. The story keeps you guessing and interested throughout. I can't wait to read the next in the series.
0765325950|5.0|This is the last book of an amazing series that has a ton of action and fantasy. It is a great female to an epic fantasy that not only rivals but tops Tolkien's LOTR series.
B003B02O0A|5.0|this book was masterfully crafted as Mr. Grisham painted scene after scene with his words. A gut-renching, thriller that led you to keep reading for hours and hours. i was so enthralled with the story and how it captivated me. A true story of character, ethics, and justice.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I took my Kindle with me on vacation so I would have lots to read, and I was able to use this free app as my alarm clock during the vacation.  It is very versatile, allowing several alarms to be set and turned on and off as wanted, and the choices for alarm sounds were all pleasant to wake up to.  This alarm clock app does everything I would want it to do, and it is very easy to use.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have loved this author from when she first wrote as Livia Dare but this book has completely shaken my confidence in this writer.  I was so disappointed with this story line-I didn't feel connected as before with the first two books and I wanted to roll my eyes at some of the plot lines. The third installment feels like filler before the final two books and I have to agree with some previous posts that it seems like the publisher just wants our money by dragging out this storyline for two more books for $10 each.  I am hesitant if I will want to buy the next two books because they pushed this book so far back that the anticipation was disappointing after reading it. If it is one book a year then honestly don't know if I will still care what happens to Gideon or Eva.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app!! Both survival &amp; creative are great! Don't waste your money on games like Discovery.  The only flaw is that Kindle/Amazon does not get updates or gets them long after Apple/I-Pads and other tablets.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Always enjoy courtroom mysteries especially with strong character development. Fascinating story that keeps you thinking long after. Couldn't put it down.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Taratino and I have a strange relationship.  He generally profoundly annoys me with his obvious arrogance and unnecessary pretentiousness.  And winning the Oscar for the screenplay here didn't exactly help matters. :0)<br /><br />But I cannot deny the man makes wooooooooooooooooonderful films!!!! Django Unchained is no exception and ranks right up there with the likes of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Death Proof, Jackie Brown and few others I liked.<br /><br />This is slavery from the Tarantino perspective and, oooooohyes.....it works....<br /><br />It is bloody and witty and fun and well-written complete with the (requisite/necessary?) element of unabashed revenge against the whole institution of slavery, which I, an African-American viewer, had absolutely no problem with.  The film is filled with eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeex performances, i.e. Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Michael Parks and Christopher Waltz.  As a matter of fact the only question I have is not with the film itself but with the supporting Oscar win for Waltz.  While his performance was measured, wonderful, and his characterization as a whole was most positive, hands down the most sparkling performances were those of Di Caprio and Jackson.  Their scenes together were simply stunning.  And of course, every time Jackson opened his mouth, I lost it.  These two deeeeeefinitely need to do another project - off the HOOK!!<br /><br />Nonetheless, a very good film that I hiiiiiiiiiiighly recommend that is indeed worthy of your movie library!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I finally gave in yesterday and started playing this game and I absolutely love it! I could play for hours on end and never get bored! Thanks creators!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I wondered if I liked Elementary because I love Lucy Liu, but I realized, about three episodes in, that Johnny Lee Miller is an amazing Sherlock. All the actors are excellent in their roles. I love the Sherlock/Watson banter between Miller and Liu. They managed to keep the Sherlock feel while keeping it new and fresh. Congratulations! The twist at the end of season one...brilliant!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a great app. But the updates for it on the kindle fire dont come as fast as the iPad and other Apple stuff. Like the newest update its not out for the kindle yet.so I guess I'll need to wait for it
B0091REZMW|3.0|I enjoy playing Mystery Manor but at times the game will not open. It says it's busy. It is a bit frustrating, but I just play something else.
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|This unit was fool proof to install on windows 7.It takes  very good pictures of 10x13 old 1897 catalog pages.<br />The auto focus  works great. Had to elevate the camera stand 6 inches to get the whole page on the picture.<br />The finished picture is easy to magnify to read the small print and mechanical details. I tried to find a scanner<br />to scan this old catalog but could not find one at a reasanable price. I sure am glad I couldn't and got this unit.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Nice game, FREE! Good way to while away wait time. Love how many levels and patterns are provided, gives entertaining variety.
B0010HA68I|5.0|I have always loved the Op/Tech line of camera neck straps.  They've been making these since I was a kid, and I still have one from way back then.  I have multiple sets of Op/Tech straps and connectors for various cameras (ranging from EVF digital to digital SLR) and binoculars.<br /><br />For years, I'd felt the need for a product like this, when I go backpacking or daypacking, and want to carry a camera and let the backpack (not my neck!) do the work.  I was all set to fabricate something myself, when I discovered this.  If your daypack or backpack has any kind of webbing strap over the shoulder straps (most do), this should work.  You might need a short extension (like the Op/Tech 1301052) to make this work, but that's the point of the system being modular.  I keep these on all my backpacks.  If you ever use a camera or binoculars while backpacking, this is for you.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I read it before seeing the movie, and it helped me understand what was really going on as the movie left much to be desired.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Quiet has so many ways it can benefit its readers. Parents of children may learn about raising their child. Business men or women may learn about introversion/extroversion in the workplace. Everyone will probably learn about interactions in public settings. Beneficial read and well worth the time spent.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Awesome sound, works for PS3 or xbox or PC, only had to buy 1 additional cord for xbox that wasn't included and cost me like $5.  Overall, for the price especially, I am 200% satisfied.  Couldn't ask for a better headset, sounds excellent! I didn't know what I was missing and what all the fuss was about until I had some of my own!
0486278077|5.0|This is the 7th time I've read this book. Now I own it, and I am delighted. A must buy.
B003DZX3US|5.0|We had been looking for this DVD for some time and we were pleased with the purchase.  A great Fathers Day gift.
