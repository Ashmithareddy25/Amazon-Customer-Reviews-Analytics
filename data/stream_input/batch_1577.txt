B008530BQW|4.0|I like the idea behind this book, but wish it had been done a bit differently. First, some of the pictures of Star Wars wildlife look almost comical. The text is a bit too scarce. I thin the The Illustrated Star Wars Universe (Star Wars) did a much better job on this front, providing real art along with fascinating backstory. I still remember reading about the shapeshifting anthropologist. Also, this book needs a serious update, if only to include episodes II and III<br /><br />UPDATE: I bought the 2010 paperback version in the hopes that it had an update to include Episodes II and III. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It's the same exact version as the 2001 book. This means no Boga and none of the creatures from the Geonosis colosseum. This is really a missed opportunity. The book itself has beautiful illustrations, but could have been so much more.
B00448SE4S|5.0|I never read the comic book and I am not even a teen, but this movie captured my attention, imagination, funny bone, and emotions. It even has a inner growth message without even trying too hard. Great comtemporary dialogs that still relate to anyone. The fighting scenes and video game references were fun, smart, imaginative and sometimes even insightful. Love the movie, also very well edited.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This app was fun being able to breed your own dragons and getting different combinations of them. I didn't like that the only way to get gold is to buy it and that it takes 3 hours to grow the dragon. It was pretty fun except for the gold.
B003VANOFY|3.0|They worked great for a while.<br /><br />After about a 35 days my headset starting doing strange things,  5 days past the return date on amazon. =(  It all started after hearing a loud screeching for 2-3 minutes while it still had 4 hours of battery life left, then it shut off.  When turned back on it shut off again, even after being plugged in.  after 5 minutes of being plugged in and powered off it would stay on after turning it back on.  The software would indicate that the battery was at 100% at this point which is odd since it normally takes 2 hours to fully charge.<br /><br />The battery in the headset is low quality, and fades very fast from normal everyday usage.  Replacement batteries are 5 bucks but the S/H on them from logitech is $6.50 for the slowest shipping.  I ordered 2 and I'm hoping they fix the issues I'm having, but I cant help but wonder how many times I'll need to replace the batteries over the lifetime of this product.<br /><br />Other things to note, when low battery, every button you press on the headset raises the volume, and the wheel nob stops working.<br /><br />Bass crackles, more of a software/driver issue then the quality of the headset there.  Was able to work around it.<br /><br />The on off button is odd, you have to hold it for an exact span of time and let go before it will turn on or off.<br /><br />The buttons are limited by the software to certain programs they effect, you cannot customize it very well, so not worth the extra money if you want the buttons.<br /><br />Support is non-existent.  Can ship it back to manufacturer for a new one with the same problems with only a month and a half wait.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Pros, comfortable and doesn't get overly sticky or hot like other cheap headsets.<br /><br />Once the bass is working right it sounds great.<br /><br />Surround sound is great for FPS'.<br /><br />The Mic is of good quality, although the mute button takes some getting use to.<br /><br />Range of the wirelesspart is excellent, can raid the fridge while raiding and hear anyone talking about you while you're afk.<br /><br />Trolling your mates with the voice synthesizers in the software is always worth a laugh.<br /><br />Somewhat durable parts.<br /><br />If you don't mind replacing the battery once a month you could use the wireless often.... about $12 a month, or if you buy replacement batteries in bulk $67 a year.

B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have been using this app for a while, but I'm finally deleting it now.  I constantly locks up.  It freezes up every time I open up the radar!  Worst of all sometimes the ads at the top cover up some of the info.

B005L3HJ8M|4.0|When you listen to music on vinyl it's as if you experience more levels of sound and it's easier to hear the instruments that you haven't noticed before... The album is amazing. Coldplay changes as we all do and I couldn't be happier with the progression.  It's current,  it's hip & it's relaxing all into one record.  Buy the album - enjoy.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Nice and simple.  Works just as it should.  Uses the entire Kindle Fire screen.  This makes it very useful as a desk calculator.  Also keeps a running tab that is stored for later if needed.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed the books. I could not put them down. But when I got to the end of the last book I was very upset. I can not believe that  it end the way it did. What a HUGE disappointment. If I would have known that I would have never read them. Not worth the ending.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Recommended reading if you have read the other 2 in the trilogy.  this finished the trilogy with a bang.  Bit soppy, but enjoyable.
B004X80QNG|2.0|The latest update caused Pocket Informant to crash when I attempted to open it for the first time after the update.. THEN, my Galaxy Tab kept crashing at boot when I tried to restart my tablet.  I suspected the problem was PI and I was right. To fix it, I had to remove my micro drive from my tablet, and using an adapter for my computer, I went into the drive and erased the folder for PI. I also deleted the remaining PI app from my tablet's internal drive.  After removing all traces of PI, I was able put my original micro drive back in my Tablet and the tablet is working fine again. I won't be trying PI again.

0345803507|5.0|Book 3 was the best out of all 3 books!! Love love love it. Sure wish the author would write more continuing from where it left off
145162607X|5.0|I have read the other books by Ms. Gregory.  I know I shall like this one.  If you or someone you know loves reading about Historical Figures. This are the books for you.The King Maker's Daughter is masterfully written, shows how Richard Nevill uses his power and his Daughter's in a power play to gain the thrown of England.  A definate must read for anyone whom enjoy historical fiction and learning about the history of England, (i.e. bloddy battles, many deaths by beheadings, hangings, etc.)  Give this book a chance.
034580404X|5.0|I received my books before the date that was originally given, so that was a plus!  These books were so good, it only took me 5 days to read the entire trilogy!  You get hooked!  I had heard it was very explicit, but it wasn't nearly as horrible as everyone said.  I thought the story line was excellent and I know that every woman that reads these are going to be looking for their own \\"Christian Grey\\" :)  Thankfully, I am married to mine, so I didn't have that far to look!  If you are looking for a quick read that is very enthralling, I would definitely suggest these books.  The twists and turns and unexpected tenderness is heart-melting.  Don't plan to do anything else while you have these b/c you won't want to!  Enjoy!
B00821PCJS|5.0|I hadn't had the chance to see the first season but after watching the last few shows of Season 2, I knew I had to go back to the beginning.  In Season 1 I learned why the humans were on the run and fighting fire fights with the Aliens and why they had invaded earth.  Most importatntly, the writer brought all of the main characters to life  and fleshed out there strengths and weaknesses that make humans who we are.  Without giving away anything and as a true Science Fiction lover, I 100% recommend viewing Season 1 - you'll be hooked!
B0017SWPXY|3.0|This book is the most emotionally manipulative, trite novel that I WAS COMPLETELY UNABLE TO PUT DOWN!  The language is clean but unremarkable, the dialog is littered with pop psychology mantras, and the story as predictable as the rain in Seattle.  And yet I was riveted and tore through the book in barely more than a day!<br /><br />For all of its shortcomings, \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is a perfectly enjoyable read.  I couldn't help but curl up next to my own aging pup as I read it.  And despite myself, I had to wipe away more tears than I'd have normally given up for literature of this type.  The characters are rendered well, and Enzo's point of view as a dog extends and refreshes the genre.
0440245915|5.0|JG is the only author that is capable of writing on such sensative material, and yet still reach his audience in a compassionate manner.  If you enjoyed the movie \\"A Time to Kill\\", you must read the book!  The details within this piece provided me the experience of becoming a resident within this small communitiy in Mississippi!
0345803493|3.0|This second novel in the Fifty Shades trilogy has all the making for a terrible book:  repetitive sex scenes with unbelievable amounts of reaching the big O, annoying interior monologue, one severely damaged character, Christian Grey, and one needy woman, Anastasia Steele. And oh, a twenty-something guy much so money can buy the moon if he so desired.<br /><br />All that said, I found it difficult to put the book down. I'd stay up late every night reading and had to drag myself to work every morning.  I think that is the sign of a good read.  Not all books have to be Pulitzer worthy to be enjoyable. I love the silly, edgy emails between Christian and Ana and would have loved to see more of this format.  It was entertaining (and yes, quite often frustrating) to follow this couple to see them kiss and make, kiss and make up.<br /><br />If you don't set your expectations too high with regards to literary value and you simply want to escape into the lives of more naughty, wealthy people, then give it a go.  Enjoy.<br /><br />Marie Estorge<br />author of STORKBITES: A MEMOIR and<br />CONFESSIONS OF A BI-POLAR MARDI GRAS QUEEN

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a great read but it was also very disturbing....I would only recommend this book to those who truly love to read!! It isn't a book to take lightly or if you are a reader that can take it or leave it.  Very well written!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it! It's really fun! Addicting but fun. It takes a keen eye and cat like reflexes to play.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|in this app you start with ten games and get to play your way to the others.just a great game.
034580404X|5.0|From start to finish these books are hard to put down. You will certainly want to order the Trilogy package.  The sexual pull between Christian and Ana is extraordinary. It is impossible to not see the lead stars of the \\"Twilight\\" series in these roles, which I understand is who she had in mind while writing these books. \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" was a true page-turner for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books rock!!! Yeah yeah yeah there's a soft porn theme here, but the bulk of this series is about a love story!! Period. A troubled man and the woman whose love saves him. It's fantastic. I read the trilogy in under a week. Haven't read a novel that excited me, motivated me to get out and live and yes....get out and find love. Well, maybe it will find me, but I'm excited to welcome what comes after reading Fifty Shades Trilogy. Get out there and read them.
034580404X|5.0|Great books....A must read for any woman.  I read the books and bought a set for my daughter.  Hard book to put down couldn't wait to read the next book in the trilogy.  I have recommended this book to all my friends.

B0002EXH4K|5.0|\\"Countdown to Extinction\\" doesn't actually need another review: it's a classic.<br /><br />Be warned, though, the remastered/remixed version you'll find in stores is significantly different from the original, and in my opinion is sensibly worse.<br />Different takes, different balances, loud mastering. Bad, bad.<br />If it ain't broke, don't fix it, Dave.<br /><br />Look for the original (perhaps used?) and enjoy this metal masterpiece.
0394401522|4.0|I love this book just as much as the beloved Volume 1.  I really love how Julia has taken the methods and concept from Volume 1 into this second masterpiece!! This series is wonderful both for those who love to cook, as well as those who can't cook at all, but would love to learn. I especially love the way the instructions for a recipe go right down the line with the ingredients, to create an experience unmatched by any other cookbook. I would recommend both volumes to anyone who wants to learn to cook, or expand their cooking horizons! Bravo Julia!!!
B004UHSB5A|1.0|Should be a simple code, yet it doesn't work. Computer will play pieces where it should not be possible. Pieces will also overlap each other making it unplayable. Long story short the game is broken.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Followed video and water testing instructions.  No problems.  First time taking pictures underwater and within 20 minutes the camera portion of my phone stopped working.  Opened the case and found no water inside, however, you could see tiny droplets of moisture inside of the camera's lens.  Should have done more research online, as it appears this has happened to others.  Apple store said they've had many customer issues with this case.  Would not recommend.  Buyer beware.
1401937268|4.0|I do like this deck. The cards and images are very pretty. The deck is thick and reading the comments I was worried about that since I have small hands. However I shuffle longways and it's no problem at all. Several things I don't like about this deck is that some of the same images are on multiple cards. They either appear smaller or facing a different way. I don't find that appealing. The images, though beautiful are difficult to read intuitively since they do not always go along with the card meaning or have much symbolism. This deck is great for beginners since it has keywords on the cards and they wouldn't have to always look up the meaning in the book. This deck feels like a tarot and oracle deck and can be used as both.

B0076UXKDG|2.0|Being a Nikon person I refuse to use Tamron, Sigma or any other lens, I have always used the Nikon VGs, D100, D300. The Grip for the D800 is significantly overpriced and decided to compare my 425.00 toy to the popular Pixel.<br />Rather than boring you with a lengthily discussion, I can summarize it by saying that I saw no difference either mechanical or electrical between the two.  Both function identically, both are strong and look appropriate on the bottom of the camera.  I returned the MB-d12, I can NOT justify it.  If this one wears out, I can buy 2 more and still have money left.
B00007KQKM|4.0|Lady Chatterley's Lover was a banned book for so long in Britain that it because a cause celebre for easing censorship. After a long court case, the book was finally released, but what many overlooked was that this story was more about the class differences than the sex. In a time when one could not rise above one's class no matter how accomplished and educated, it was not the fact that Connie was committing adultery, after all, her husband had even suggested that she take a lover as he wanted an heir, and Mellors was not her first lover - it was that she was having an affair with a member of the lower class - a servant of all things! A betrayal of her class! That Mellors was quite well educated and had risen way above his origins, becoming an officer in the Indian Army, did not matter - \\"he isn't one of us!\\". After WWI he had returned to his hometown and would always be branded a member of the lower class. The only way to escape his origins was to emigrate.<br /><br />Ken Russell had previously filmed Lawrence's Women in Love, and The Rainbow, so it is hardly surprising to find him taking on Lady Chatterley.  The incredibly versatile Sean Bean makes a superb Mellors, not least because he has the right accent, comes from that part of Britain, and exudes masculinity from every pore. He successfully displays the contempt for the idea of the class structure, rather than the people born into it. Millions had died in a terrible war which decimated the upper class and caused massive social upheaval, yet the workers were expected to go back to their place in life as it was before. Mellors has as much contempt for the lower class for accepting the status quo as he does for the upper class who make the rules. He really wants nothing to do with either group, but his affair with Connie is seen as a threat by both sides.<br /><br />Joely Richardson is also worth a mention and does not overplay her role of the wartime bride from a more liberal background who discovered that to marry in haste is to repent at leisure.<br /><br />The real star, in a supporting role, is Shirley Ann Field, as the social climbing nurse companion, Mrs. Bolton, who slyly encourages the affair as she sees her opportunity to become indispensable to Clifford, and thus, to rise above her station as far as possible. Not a servant, but almost one of the family. She is well aware that under normal circumstances Sir Clifford would never associate with her socially or consider her anything other than the paid help, but an opportunity has presented itself for her to mix with the gentry almost as a revered childhood nanny, and she is going to make the most of it. I got the feeling that if Connie had given up Mellors and decided to stay with Clifford, Mrs. Bolton might have soaped the stairs. Shirley Ann Field came from a difficult childhood in Lancashire, UK, to become a great beauty and popular actress in working class dramas. In this film she shows that she is more than a pretty face. I would recommend this film for its lovely photography as well as excellent acting.

1452101248|5.0|I have several vegetarian and vegan cookbooks because I really like fresh fruits and vegetables. But I am not a vegetarian and dislike the smug, preachy, sometimes scolding tone in those cookbooks. So this book -- a vegetarian cookbook by someone who is not a vegetarian but just likes fruits and vegetables -- was perfect for me. I liked the author's tone right off the bat.<br /><br />Anyway, after four months I have cooked mostly through \\"Plenty.\\" The great majority of the recipes are extremely good, at least to my taste. Here and there they have the sort of vagueness that comes when an expert cook who uses high-tech equipment to cook large quantities of food tries to reduce the scale of a recipe to the sort of equipment and time available to a home cook. Also some of the ingredients are hard to get if you live outside of a big city, as I do. But this sort of issue springs up in almost every cookbook that I own written by a fancy chef. What's most important (to me, anyway) is that Ottolenghi has great taste -- lots of ideas that I hadn't come across but that make sense when you eat them. (Many of these combinations that are unfamiliar to me seem to be legacies of the author's Middle Eastern childhood.)<br /><br />My only caveat is that when the author tries to use Japanese ingredients he seems to me to be wandering out of his territory, and the recipes aren't nearly as good or imaginative. (My favorite Japanese cookbook is still Tsuji's [[ASIN:1568363885 Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art]].) But this is a tiny gripe about a wonderful book. I've already given two copies to friends, and will probably end up giving some more.

B006RUJST6|5.0|What a gem...I stumbled upon Slammed and have not stopped recommending it. It wasn't \\"my type\\" and I am now hooked. It's a story that takes you through quite possibly every emotion under the sun and you don't want to put down. The characters are beautifully explained and nothing is really left out. It's a pained story about a young girl who falls in love with a guy who turns out to be someone she can't date (I don't want to spoil it) and how she deals with having recently lost her father, along the adjustment of moving to a new place. She has to make new friends and care for her younger brother all while dealing with the emotional turmoil of this guy \\"she can't be with\\".  It seems simple enough but the wrenches the author throws into the story are what make it captivating. Definitely a must read!!
B005LAII62|5.0|This new 3D stop-motion from animation is Impressive, Amusing, and Quirky. A delightful summer movie for the entire family. The eerie, whimsical story portrays that you don't become a hero by being normal, and begins in a small town that is under siege by zombies. Who can it call? Of course, the misunderstood local boy is called upon. Norman, who can speak with the dead, has to face challenges as he takes on much more than zombies. He must face ghosts, witches, and the grown-ups, to save the town from a centuries-old-curse. But, his paranormal activities may be pushed to the limits. Entertaining from start to finish, Animation is Colorful, and the story is Delightful. A fun-filled summer movie the entire family can enjoy!

B007IXWL2C|2.0|This series is overrated. The plot is weak and predictable. By the third book, I can't wait for it to end. I think people love the books only because of the sex and S&M scenes. In that sense, the book is truly unique.
1442352604|4.0|Isabel and Anne Neville are the daughters of Richard Neville. Their father is known as the \\"kingmaker\\". He is the guy that helped groom and turn Edward into King Edward. Edward and Richard were good friends until Edward married. His queen did not like the Neville's and instead turned to the Rivers as her friends. Richard and Edward eventually could not agree on their political reviews and Richard decided to restore Henry Tudor VI to the throne. A way that Richard tried to do so was by marrying his eldest daughter, Isabel to George, Duke of Clarence.<br /><br />One thing that I got to say about Ms. Gregory is that she sure does know how to make history come alive. It was nice to actually read about someone other then Anne Boleyn. Not that I don't like Anne but I have heard her tale told so many times now that I want to get myself more familiar with other famous people in history.<br /><br />After reading about Isabel and Anne Neville and what they had to endure with their father and mother, all I have to say is \\"Be careful what you reap and sow\\" Mr. Neville learned this the hard way. He lost his live for his desires and gains. To be used as pawns for your father in a deadly game of \\"Risk\\".  Of course after getting to know Isabel and Anne better, my feelings towards them did shift a bit. Isabel grew to be hateful and Anne she was clever.<br /><br />I could tell that Ms. Gregory really likes writing about time period books as she did not gloss over anything in this book. In fact, as much as I did enjoy reading this book and this was a good thing at over four hundred pages, enjoying this book helped to make the time pass along quicker. However I did skim some in the middle as I wanted to get to the meat of the story. The Kingmaker's Daughter deserves a royal spot on your bookshelf!
B005KELW26|5.0|I love this case, the one that I brought before had formed a crease in the middle but this case seems to work well.
B00846REIS|2.0|First off, this book uses the word women hate above all others - yep, the \\"C\\" word.  It's more than possible to graphically describe sex without using that horrible word.<br />I was looking for a Fifty Shades-like book and this was NOT it.  I'm in total agreement with anyone who complains that Fifty Shades is badly written, but the books resonate.  Bared to You did not stay with me after I finished it.  I will probably read the next two, but I read a lot.<br />If you're looking for the next Fifty Shades, there will not be one.  If you want a series that has a similar emotional impact and will merit repeat reading, try the All Souls trilogy (A Discovery of Witches and Shadow of Night).  There's very little sex and a lot is left to the imagination, but Diana and Matthew's relationship is as deep as Ana and Christian's.  Gideon and Eva are nowhere near as compelling.
6302158095|5.0|Purchased for my granddaughter who is one year old and loves to listen to her sister playing classical music on her violin.  This is a great movie because it has the Disney characters for fun and entertainment, AND, it has beautiful classical music.  It is a wonderful way for a child to hear music she/he might not hear until they are older - stimulating their mind and imagination and, who knows, may encourage them to play an instrument.  Studies have shown that many children who play an instrument do better in school - with better grades, being able to focus on their work and pride in their achievement.  Playing an instrument gives them a wonderful talent they can be proud of and enjoy their whole life. I am thankful Disney made this movie and thankful to have found it in such good condition.

Prepare for a handful of emotions as you sit in disbelief, hope and despair, on the edge of your seat, wanting to unravel the truth, wanting to end the madness...if that's possible...this book delivers!

B0086700CM|5.0|Every Kindle owner should have this game. Very addictive, easy to learn, nice graphics, recommend for all ages. My kids love it!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I have read the trilogy, I can't help but think if you added vampires and werewolfs take out the bondage that I would be reading the Twilight series. Here you have the innocent, inexperienced but yet intelligent girl, the over bearing lover, the want to be lover Jose, and the single dad with a airy mother.<br />The over bearing lover is rich the want to be lover is not the similarities go on. The books are an easy read, but easy to put down and not pick back up I found to much repetition in all three, so he is mad at her again yada yada.<br />I also felt the author had run out of energy and was tired also of the whole series with the ending in the third book. Ending the book with the start of the first book but in Christians view was  wasteful writing and made me feel cheated out of a good ending because I really needed one after reading all that abuse and rubbish,  please don't tell me there will be a fourth.<br />I am sure there are men and women in the 21st century that still maintain this life style but to be honest I don't think staff accept this treatment from employers anymore, maybe the author could have thrown a bit of employee upheaval into his sordid little mix.
1439102732|5.0|Yet another one of Picoult's master pieces. Really makes you think about one of today's hot topics. A stay up all night when you have to be up early the next morning just because you want to know what happens, type of book.
B006PGL7OQ|4.0|Independent movie that is a must have.  I'm cheap, however I found no reason to wait until the price came down.  Michael Shannon gives a powerful performance.  It is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you along for the ride.  Jessica Chastain again shows how versital her talents are.  You end up feeling for each character in the movie.<br /><br />Blu Ray was my choice.  The immages of rural Ohio are dramatically beautiful.  The movie extends to two hours long.  It is a deliberate pace.  Yet, when it is over, it feels like a much shorter movie.<br /><br />Take a chance on this one.  Excelent addition to any one's collection.
B007US9NA8|5.0|Great book for beginners and advanced. Good info wether you want to improve or be a professional body builder. Wish I would have read the original when I first started bodybuilding.

B007QNRMUU|5.0|Closing in on the big 70, I have been a music fan since the late 40s. My interests go from the Ink Spots and Sinatra up and through the 1980s. At that time the music being put out no longer interested me.  I had never heard of Jason Mraz until I saw him perform on Live From Daryll's House.  His vocals were amazing, his lyrics reminded me of singer/songwriters of the 1970s. Having only heard a few of his songs on that show, I took the chance and ordered his CD. To my amazement every single song I had a connection to. The lyrics and the rhythm were soft and soothing and reminded me of a time when love was truly the essence of music. Over the years I have enjoyed what most would consider \\"rock and roll\\". But these songs struck a chord in me that I have not felt in decades. Obviously, everyone has their own likes and dislikes. But for someone who has listened to so many different genres of music over the years, I am amazed with what this young man has accomplished. I enjoyed this CD so much that I would actually look into his previous endeavors and that in itself says alot. I don't impress easily (especially with today's music). I guess you could call me an old geezer; however, I give this young man five stars.
1401937519|5.0|As I have grown in years, my spiritual growth has been very organic and directed by gut instincts and what I feel to be God-led movement. This work supports this feeling for me and will help me continue to try to allow myself to be open to what is next.<br />The book is wonderfully written with a good amount of personal reflection, without being preachy. The words near the end of the book have proven especially helpful for me as they have kind of given me a good direction to follow for my next steps in spiritual growth. If more people would read this, heed the words, and live the life of love, we would all be better as would our world. There is something so simple and powerful in the concept of pure love for self and others. After all, that is what we are called to in the first two commandments. Thank you for your witness, your grace in sharing, and the support of the people who made this all possible.

B005IY3DP2|5.0|I read about \\"Velociraptor\\" on a blog and was fascinated by what was written.  That being said, I had to take a listen.  Despite the off-putting title and cover (? 4 hairy Freddie Mercury lookalikes), it took about 2 listens until I was hooked.  Like another reviewer put it, it is a tribute to a lot of styles since the 60s. \\"Let's Roll...\\" is very reminiscent of a mid 60s British dandy, while \\"Days are forgotten\\" of early Britpop. \\"Goodbye Kiss\\" is an updated Kinks during their \\"Village Green\\" days, while \\"La Fee Verte\\" sounds lackadasical ode to absinthe a la Gainsbourg.  \\"Velociraptor\\" is Blue Oyster Cult on speed, while \\"Acid Turkish Bath\\" is Strawberry Alarm Clock on downers.  \\"I hear voices\\" heralds a rewrapping of 80s electronica, followed by the reverberating \\"Re-wired\\".  \\"Man of Simple Pleasures\\" has a tinge of Noel Gallagher's waivering vocals.  \\"Switchblade Smiles\\" is definitely the highlight of the album, mixing many styles into one rocking anthem, to cool down with \\"Neon Noon\\".<br /><br />The recording is tight, with great moments by all the group members.  Definitely highly recommended for anyone in the US; it is a refreshing take on rock after years of jangly, whiny \\"alternative\\" bands.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Released In 1969, Abbey Road is possibly the greatest Beatles album ever released. It was the last album the Beatles recorded, but not the last they released.<br /><br />The \\"A side\\" of Abbey Road features the songs: \\"Come Together\\", \\"Something\\", \\"Oh! Darling\\", \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and \\"I Want You(She's So Heavy)\\". The \\"B side\\" features \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", and the Abbey Road Medley, spanning the rest of the album. The Abbey Road Medley is a collection of finished and unfinished songs crammed into one long, seamless track.<br /><br />The album is one of the Beatles last albums, recorded at a time where they started to break up. Most of the songs feature one member of the band with the others in the background.<br /><br />This album is one of the greatest ever recorded. It is essential to anyone's music library. Period.
034580404X|5.0|The three books were in excellent condition and arrived in only a couple of days after ordering.  The writing style of this author is poor, but if you can get beyond the writing then it is worth a read.  The story itself is okay though certainly not a literary piece.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|These books denigrate women in so many ways. The female must orgasm every time to fulfill the male ego. The female body is to be tied up and trussed for total male control. The female body can be marked by the male to demonstrate possession. The female can be stalked in an acceptable manner. The male can order food for the female.the male can force the female to eat to keep up with the male sexual demands. The male can control where the female goes and who she can see what she can drink. All very sad !
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book (2nd in Hunger Games series).<br />Read on my Kindle Touch, and occasionally on my iPhone.<br />Delivery and presentation worked great!
B00843TZJ2|4.0|The CSN 2012 Live DVD and CD have the boys singing and playing better than they have in years. Stephen Stills is particularly highlighted here, with the majority of songs being his. He hasn't sounded this good in a long time. 3 Buffalo Springfield tunes, 2 Manassas tunes, and some songs they typically don't do. Crosby and Nash are both good here, as usual. The addition of the prime-time Stills perfomances make this a great addition.

034580404X|3.0|My friends raved about the 50 Shades of Grey novel that was receiving lots of mainstream attention, so I decided to check it out for myself. I bought the whole trilogy after learning it was a series. After reading Book I, I was not particularly excited to read Book II: 50 Shades Darker, and by the time I was done with Book II, I just decided not even to read Book III: 50 Shades Freed. My friend ended up telling me how the series ended when I told her I wasn't going to read it. It's a great read i guess if you have time to kill and just like to read, but I love to read and when I spend my leisure time reading I want to fall in love with characters and find myself fully immersed in the story. These books failed to make me do that. I think b/c I went in with high hopes which may be why I was letdown, however, I say buy them and judge for yourself.

0345803485|1.0|I didn't even finish this book. I got maybe 3 chapters in before it before it got thrown across the room. I love books so I do not say that very often. I've read amateur stories that were written way better then this. This is also another title I wouldn't touch if it was free. I'm not even sure how these books got published to be honest with you
0452295548|3.0|This book was highly recommended by a friend, and I expected to find a scientific/personal account of stroke. But Bolte's book is more about the mysterious enlightenment she achieved afterward than anything else. Bolte recounts her stroke in very minute detail, which I found hard to accept given that her stroke wiped out much of her left brain, where memory resides. In one line she says later in the book that a therapist helped her recover the memories--but how? She also discusses at great length how she has modified her personality after the stroke by supressing the judgmental, impatient, etc. side of her personality, but again--how exactly? I would have liked to know more about how the \\"enlightenment\\" she experienced ties into other meditative practices, for example.  Some of Bolte's recommendations for taking care of stroke victims were interesting--protect them from too much sensory stimulation, noise, light, etc. But would this be general advice, not just particular to her specific condition? This book left me with more questions than answers.
B00846REIS|5.0|Hot, sexy & romantic all the way through!  I loved this story and cant wait for the next book.  Well written and the love scenes will leave you feeling like you were right there with Gideon n Eva!

B008EQIEWS|4.0|Product was as described. Brand new and not opened. Awesome movie and cast. Although not as good as the first one.
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|I'd never heard this album/CD.  Huge Pink Floyd fan (and music fan) but never heard this one.<br /><br />Simple.  One of the best \\"first albums\\" ever made.  Syd Barret was a genius until he \\"went under\\".<br /><br />I don't know how this recording escaped me.  Brilliant!  And, the group's first album??  If you place this recording within the years it was recorded, THIS IS THE BEST of the psychodelic albums - trumping Sargeant Pepper's and the rest.  I can't keep from playing this CD.<br /><br />So, there it is.  What a GEM.  It's sad what happened to Syd, for whatever reason.  Listening to his vocals on \\"Flaming\\", he sounds like he is actually enjoying and putting all into the recording.  What a triumph!<br /><br />And also, what a sad story.  Don't hesitate to buy this.  Think about the times.  What an album.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out, I have waited until now to review to give it a fair chance by listening it to more than 1 or 2 times. Testament has grown over the years and gotten better with age, I have been a fan for over 20 years and can say the last 2 albums are great pieces of work, not that the 1's before are not, these really standout... If you are a true Testament fan or a old metal fan you will like this, every song is very solid with at least 6 of them being outstanding! The covers are cool too, but they are covers.<br />Do yourself a favor, buy this and really listen to it before you judge, no one can make a honest judgement after only a couple listens!!

B0081KTI0E|1.0|Boring! Very slow, definitely not scary. Complete waste of time and money.  Acting was ok. Definitely would not recommend anyone to see this movie.
0062060562|5.0|I put out a facebook request \\"anyone know any good books to read.\\" One of my friends casually mentioned this book and I'm so glad she did. I could not put it down. The way the author wove the story together (and when the main character forgets what happened the day before that's no easy task!) was amazing. I am not the quickest reader in the world and I finished the book in 3 days. I just couldn't stop reading it.<br />Get it!
B008XG1X18|1.0|having the same issue as another user. I try to log in with my Facebook account and all the app does is spin its wheels without any results. Fix this!

0062197258|4.0|Cathy is in love with Lee. She lived her life differently in 2003. Now she is OCD  with doors. She also has a tough time leaving the apartment.<br /><br />Through out the book we learn more about Cathy's & Lee's relationship in the past. We also see her trying to move on and forward with her life and getting help. She finds a new love with someone.<br /><br />This book kept me on my toes and it was so much better than I thought it would be. This book brought up rape, abuse, OCD. Cathy was asking for help but no one would listen to her.<br /><br />Best Line: I'm agreeing with you.Of course change is scary. But you get through it, and you'll get through this change as well. Won't you ?
B000JCSBU0|1.0|I don't understand all the great reviews.  this was a terrible, bizarre movie with not much of a plot.  all the characters are a waste of oxygen. i tried for an hour to like this movie before i gave up.  if you are normal and have values and morals, watch something else.
B000053V7Q|5.0|I was well pleased with the picture quality and the sound. The video has more music and less talk than the original one. It is a must for Elvis fans and for those younger persons who want to see what Elvis was all about.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|It was terrible, obviously written by a twelve year old boy. It was almost as bad, or maybe even worse than the Twitlight series. sorry but the main character seems to have lost all her brain cells - and capacity to think for herself, as soon as the idiot man showed up. what kind of role model is that for young woman. and not only does she lose her brain but she seems to believe she has to do whatever he wants her to do to keep him...same old story with a new twist...chains and whips...come off it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|best love story ever.  true love conquers all.  all three books are great. absolutely loved it.  where is my christine grey???????  lol
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It absolutely love this movie.  It is HILARIOUS!  It is made for kids and adults alike.<br />Some of the jokes are discretely made for adults.  Steve Carrell did a great job with the movie.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said in the 2131 reviews already posted. love the ease of the app and cross platform. it works great and wicked fast.
B00884GR0W|1.0|this app was a waste of my time and money. I'm not saying so because I think its a minecraft rip off, but because the game itself is terrible. I know a lot of other reviews talk about skills and hell and houses,  but I couldn't even get through the tutorial! The problem was I could not find a &quot;Ted the viking&quot; . I think this is a pretty huge problem with the spawn. As a result I would not recommend this to someone who doesn't have a friend to explain it to them, and even then the gameplay is boring.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy this app. It does great, and has options to make it easy or more difficult. Quick, simple and fun.

B006HGXGWU|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but in the end my wife and I both disliked it. It's well acted and the creepy factor is great. The \\"is he crazy or a prophet\\" mystery is dragged out way too long. And the ending left me with, \\"WTF?!\\" It was too silly even for me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been waiting for this app ever since I got my kindle fire last year.  Its everything I wanted. it's beautiful *tear* :) Seriously though, I love it.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I fall asleep faster and sleep better with this app!  I just love it! the rain on roof with thunder and daduk is my favorite!
B0081KTI0E|2.0|I liked this movie but the ending ruined it. Minor spoilers ahead. Although the sets were fantastic and the watery setting was very nice, all the people in the film lack character. Oh, sure you learn about their pasts, but no one develops or changes much.<br /><br />This is especially true for the movie's main villain. It's just an evil thing. Sure it has motivation, but there's no chance for redemption or resolution. The first 90% is good spooky entertainment. The last bit is high budget indie laziness disguised as high concept. It's more a record of events than a story.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Awesome! Enjoying it very much. Sharing with firends. Can't wait for more J. B. to be released. For now I will watch this many times.
B003QTUQGU|1.0|Just tried Amazon's streaming videos for the first time and was shocked to learn it wouldn't let me watch anything but the lowest streaming quality even though I have tested download speeds of 16mbps over fiber optic. Netflix offers streaming movies in HD, so there's simply no comparison. What a horrible way to watch a Burton movie at 240p. I didn't watch the rest of this one and I'm getting a refund as soon as I finish this review.<br /><br />Run as fast as you can from Amazon video rentals!!!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Ridley Scott's movie Alien, on the surface, pitted a space crew against an alien creature. The subtext of that movie was the pitting of Creationism against Darwinism. The existence of another intelligent life form lays seeds of doubt as to our Divine Creation. Darwin's natural selection, which he later described as survival of the fittest, has been elevated from the global stage to that of the universe. Scott suggests with the Alien creature that we may not be Divinely Created, and that we may not be the fittest either. The Alien creature is the epitome of Darwinism. It has evolved to adapt to any environment.<br />In Prometheus Scott has once again challenged Divine Creation and added a new wrinkle to who may be the fittest. Prometheus posits that not only are we not Divinely Created but that we were created by a higher humanoid species. The fact that the \\"Engineers\\", as they call them, have tried to harnass and may have created the Alien puts them in the position of the fittest. This is where the movie fails for many of the negative reviewers. Some are disturbed by the notion that not only were we not Divinely Created, but that we may be nothing more than a science experiment. For others, the fact that this is not more clearly stated in the film, it's vagueness, is what brings it down.<br />In Alien the action, suspense and horror were in the forefront, with the notions of Creationism and Darwinism lurking in the shadows. In Prometheus the notions of Creationism and Darwinism have been brought out, not far enough for some, and the action and horror are given more of a backseat.<br />So Prometheus is not an action film. Instead of answering our questions about the Alien series, it raises even more questions.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This was a surprise BD gift for my wife.  She's been going through withdrawals since it went off the air, and reruns are becoming less frequent.  If you want to make a SATC fan happy, get her, or him the box set.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Yessssssss!!!!!! Thank you, thank you! Its about time they created this app! Works beautifully on my fire and have had no problem. Now I may never get off my Kindle!
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I have been hearing great things about this book for so long that I was thrilled to see it offered as a digital library loan, and I snatched it right up. After reading it I am so in love with the story that I am going to rush right out and buy my very own copy from amazon. I ADORED this sweet contemporary young adult romance, and I want to have my own copy so that I can read it over and over again. Sweet. That is the word that first comes to mind as I think of how to describe this book. But not sickly sweet in that melodramatic way that some YA romances can be. No. For me this was the kind of book I love ... one that leaves me with a giant smile on my face after finishing it, satisfied at being along for the journey as two people find the beginning of their happily ever after.<br /><br />Anna is sent to an exclusive American boarding school in Paris against her will for her senior year of high school. She's not happy to be thrown in this foreign environment and at a small school, but luckily Anna ends up next door to a nice girl who introduces her to her friends. One of these friends is Etienne St. Clair, and it is clear from the beginning that Etienne and Anna will be great friends. And soon it becomes clear that the two of them are falling desperately in love with one another. But Etienne has a long time girlfriend who is in college a short distance away, and Anna is still pining for a boy she left behind in Atlanta. So in theory they shouldn't be pining for one another, but in reality they can't stay away from one another.<br /><br />Like many stories in this genre, so many things could have been solved if the two of them could have just opened their mouth and TALKED to one another. So many misunderstandings and hurt feelings and wasted time could have been avoided if they would have been open and honest about how they were feeling. For two people who were so comfortable with one another they were ridiculously bad at really sharing their feelings. But, do you know what I really liked about this particular novel? Anna and Etienne really sit down and think about why they have been so reluctant to share their feelings, why they were so reluctant to jump in and make their relationship work. The understanding that Anna in particular comes to at the end of the novel was very satisfying for me. I think that it is knowledge that would have been helpful to me when I was young and going through the mandatory relationship drama that can plague high schools students. And that self-discovery took what could have been a very frustrating story and made it into a very rewarding one for me. I appreciated the ending so much. Very satisfying!<br /><br />Anna was a great voice for this novel. She had just the right amount of vulnerability and strength, intelligence and stupidity, humor and seriousness. In other words, she was relatable and believable, and I loved reading her thoughts as she navigated the difficulties of a new student in a foreign environment. She seemed real to me. There were times when her actions toward Etienne seemed a bit over the top, but that made her seem even more real to me. Haven't we all completely lost it beyond reason every once in a while when a close friend hurts us? It isn't logical, but we are rarely logical when our feelings are strong.<br /><br />And Etienne. He is not a perfect hero in this book. He makes some questionable relationship decisions, and to be honest, even after finishing the book I'm not sure that I really understand his reasoning behind those decisions. But it is the whole package that makes Etienne such a wonderful character. Despite his flaws he was so wonderful to Anna. He was a great friend to her, not only when she was in distress, but in their normal everyday interactions. Oh how I would love to read some of these scenes through his POV. I know I've been using this word a lot in this review, but it is true ... Etienne seemed real to me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as a sweetyoung adult romance. I know this is one that I will be reading again. I am excited to have discovered Stephanie Perkins as a writer, and I can't wait to read more books from this talented writer! Five stars!young adult romance. I know this is one that I will be reading again.

B005WUHAX8|4.0|I liked the case a lot when I first put it on.  The only draw back was the plastic that goes over the screen.  I found you had to push a bit harder than normal, it seemed the plastic part may have been a bit loose and didn't cling to the screen as I would have expected.  Never did try and put in water or drop it because I was afraid it might ruin it.  Very light weight.

1609611543|5.0|It is a fascinating book and I really enjoyed it.  I have recommended it to several people.<br /><br />  It is very informative and easy to read.  I am following the author's advice and feel much better following<br /><br />  his suggested diet.
B0045I3EJM|5.0|Love this film. I highly recommend it for anyone who appreciates philosophy or movies that \\"make you think.\\" Jared Leto is stunning as Nemo Nobody who is on a quest to make the right choice. \\"If you don't choose...anything....remains possible.\\" This is a movie that you can watch again and again always picking up new concepts and themes. It is definitely food for thought.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!! it's so energetic..full of energy.It even keeps u busy!! I love it!!!!!It keeps my imagination running and going every time I play this game.I can never get enlighten it! Very Addictive!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Like the fact you can pick how many decks you want in your game! Plus each game is different and a challenge; so rewarding when and if you win!
B0080R7Q70|5.0|Yes, The Flowe Kings are back ! and the wait was worth it.<br /><br />I guess that having a long hiatus, all members were capable to developed their own proyects; even with the FK`s great spin off bands like Karmakanic and Agents of Mercy, and of course Bodin with his own solo albums. The hiatus was very fruitful because they returned with a more straight foward approach<br /><br />The first disc is very good. But the second disc is just fantastic...the songs are one of the bests this band has released in their entire discography..it sort of reminds me \\"The Rainmaker\\" which is one of my favorite FK albums.<br /><br />I am pissed off by some few negative review that have lowered the total rating of the album, without a good reason...one of the review lies in the deception someone had, because she thought, she was buying an eastern music cd, based in the art cover.<br /><br />If you are a FK fan, buy it!<br /><br />I am gonna post mine`s  with a five stars because the guys deserve it !<br /><br />Hope this review may help you!
B001JI5DRC|3.0|I didn't really download or watch the movie from Amazon, I've seen this before.<br />Someone gave me a free link to get a copy of it here, so I used it just to see how the process worked here at Amazon.<br /><br />As for the movie, it's a good one if you like claustrophbic situations in sub-zero environments while traveling thousands of miles an hour...
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Finally a book written by someone who knows what they are doing. A true Story Teller. Don't sit on your wallet, buy this one, you won't be disappointed. I cannot wait for the second installment. This is what fantasy should be.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Does not work at all. I have a small apartment and thought this would make my kinect work much better. First off its very difficult to calibrate and then the kinect takes a very long time to start up when the zoom is installed on it. Games were not as crisp and any games with menus are impossible to play. Navigating menus with this device is frustrating and never the same as just using the kinect alone. The technology must improve before this is ever a viable fix. Immediately returned after a few hours of use
0345803493|5.0|I can not tell you how much I enjoyed these books. I bought Fifty Shades of Grey and when I finished the book I realized that there were two more books. I RAN to Amazon to purchase the other two and devoured each one with delight. I enjoyed these books more than I have enjoyed a book in years. I see a movie coming and PRAY that the author hurry's and writes sequils. AMAZING.....<br />I miss the books already and am looking for something else to read.
B004I1K2NW|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Peter Jackson's first big budgeted film with an international cast & wide release, is a genre classic. One part black comedy & one part horror film, this movie has a major \\"Ghostbusters\\" knock off feel, & that is exactly what it is, though quite a bit darker than the former, & more complex.<br /><br />Underrated Jeffery Combs, steals the show as a Nazi like \\"Special Agent Dammers, trying to expose Michael J. Fox as a ghost busting fraud & murderer, until he gets...enlightened.<br /><br />For lovers of shits & giggles, with some serious bad guys, or should I say ghosts.<br /><br />Fun for all, & all for fun!
B005JABSB6|2.0|Good glasses. The best: The glasses have a button for change 2D and 3D, although the movie is 3D. I think only glasses Sharp have this characteristic. Not economic, but is original product.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good friend recommended this book to me even though he himself hadn't read it yet. I did a little research on it and read enough good reviews to take the plunge and buy it. I finished it in a few days because it was that riveting. The book is divided into two parts and Flynn takes readers on a wild goose chase.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Lots of action and drama combined as in the previous two but the ending is lacking something. Just leaves you there going \\"is that it?\\" but other than that its an excellent read.
1469984202|5.0|I bought the Kindle edition of this book based on reviews, and I'm so so so glad I did.  Absolutely engrossing and believable.  I wasn't ready for it to end!  Can't wait to read more.  Thanks, Hugh!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Elongated version of a crappy Mills and Boon (for those who read them). Not sure how this became a best seller in the first place. Don't waste your money (like I did).
B008OOYALE|4.0|the only thing that doesn't give it 5 star is the fact that it takes so long to do things it takes away from the game itself. you end up waiting longer for things than actually playing the game. if it weren't for that I would give it 5 stars. other than that the graphics are great, the idea is cute and its free.
031620157X|5.0|This is a charming children's story that anyone can enjoy.  Chris Colfer is a blossoming talent and we are certain to see great things from him in the future.  The story is very well-written and speaks to the imagination, making the reader consider fairy tales in a new light.<br /><br />One of the most notable aspects of the book is how the fairy tale characters seem so real.  Through their dialogue and backstories, the characters are extremely relatable and worldly.<br /><br />The book is absolutely delightful and I can't wait for the sequel!<br /><br />Mark my words: Chris Colfer is destined for big things.
B0086700CM|4.0|My 10 year old made me buy this app and I wish I never would have... only because it's so FUN and addictive.  It is entertaining and challenging; the only real issue i've found is the fast-paced, quick reaction required in game play puts you at risk for damaging your tablet from drops, etc.  Or worse yet, when using a stylus it leaves scuffs and scratches.  maybe it was the cheap stylus, but it's certainly a lesson learned. UGH
B00082IJ08|5.0|This isn't rainy day, reflective music...which I also love, btw...it's put the convertible top down, crank up the Shaker 1000, and fly down the road.  I was a Gorillaz fan before buying this album, but am even more so now.  Kids With Guns, Last Living Souls, and Demon Days are probably my 3 fave songs on the album. It's a diverse, smartly crafted (no doubt helped out by the numerous collaborations) set of songs that are just fun to listen to.
030758836X|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was well written and the character development was reasonable. That is not to say that the characters are likable, but their voices are very clear and and very compelling.  The plot moves quickly and frequently when I thought I had it figured out, there was an unexpected twist. There were several spots of complete implausibility, but hey, it is fiction. I really enjoyed it until the very end. The last pages of the book to me read like the end of a movie, like they just have to leave the door open for a sequel or something.I understand where the author was going with it, I just feel that it could have been better articulated.
B00284BMBM|5.0|Seller included a note which expressed his concern over my satisfaction with the purchase I had made.  Despite the note probably being printed in mass for all sales, this made the transaction feel more personal.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Every single member of our family has been thrilled with this amazing history<br />Suzanne Collins rocks!<br />Can't wait to see what she is working on
B005CRQ2IU|1.0|I purchased this book to read on my Kindle app...Well, they shouldn't even offer it for digital, because the text is too small to read...Portrait, Landscape...It doesn't matter. I tried everything. So then I thought, well I will read it on my PC Kindle Reader...BUZzZzZz..>Wrong Answer&lt;...It's not available for the PC reader...So now I paid for the book that I have no way to read...Lovely.
034537410X|5.0|After many months I finally achieved lucid dreams. Learn from my mistakes though! DO WHAT THE BOOK SAYS! You might not think that keeping a dream journal and doing the dream signs and stuff isn't as important, but it is! Be consistent, keep an open mind, and hopefully it won't take as long for you as it did for me!
B00005LMBK|5.0|I could listen to Clint Eastwood and Latin Simone over and over...OK, I have listened to them (and the whole album) over and over.  Super catchy, fun, creatively crafted electronic-meets-hiphop with flavors of multiple other genres thrown in. One of my favorite albums by one of my favorite groups.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Perfect for the kindle. Any book that is quite large, (a lot of Stephen King books), the kindle is perfect for larger, heavier books. Much easier to tote The Fall of Giants around on the kindle!
B005F2BAGQ|1.0|I was very disappointed with the quality of video. It constantly froze and would only un-freeze if I closed the video player and then opened it again, sending me back to the beginning of the episode. I would not recommend that anybody purchase Amazon videos until they get this issue figured out.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Addicting game,  hard to put it down! If you liked Mario Brothers you will love this game! Watch for shamrocks!
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I think it's hard for any movie based on a book to surpass the original, but the Hunger Games does a pretty good job of doing it justice. Yes, the book is better, but the movie stays true to the story, the cast is wonderful, the parts are played as they should, and everyone has good chemistry. The Capitol, District 12, and the arena come right off the pages, and the costumes are just what I imagined. The score is also very good.<br /><br />There are some parts of the movie that I didn't care for due to small changes from the book, but you will have that with any adaption, and there was some moments when the cameras seemed to be unnecessarily shaky. But overall it was a very good adaption, and stayed true.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Once again Sophie will make you laugh and enjoy another great novel she has wrote. a great summer read! you won't be dissapponited.
B001PILRGC|5.0|Season 5 was SO good.  What a shame, SG-1 was ten seasons, I wish Atlantis could have had a few more.  What a great show.  The visual effects were getting better and better with lots of action, story line and plot twists.  Where are these Stargate Atlantis movies they talked about making?
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I did love the movie. It opened my eyes. I would have liked for the agriculture side to tell their side, but it seems like they did not want to be a part of the film. I hope there's a follow up of this movie, with the big companies [tyson, smithfield, etc] in the movie.But this movie does have a lot of information. I WOULD recommend this movie, nevertheless, it is very informative and makes you actually think of were your food is coming from.
0345803485|1.0|This book was one of the worst books I have ever read.  It is poorly written, no character development, and her constant repetition is annoying.  The Beauty Series by Anne Rice is a much better book about dominance and submission.
0743270754|5.0|The ability to take a complex cast of characters, set in a complex and tumultuous segment of our history,and weave them into a riveting, flowing and fascinating portrayal of a president to whom we owe a greater debt of gratitude than previously imagined is what sets this historical biography at the top of the genre. Although a hefty 750+ pages in length, I found it one of the few \\"hard to put down\\" books I've recently read. I am now a convert and fan of Doris Kearns Goodwin, and recommend this book without reservation for anyone with an appreciation of U.S. history and President Lincoln.
B0086DBE62|5.0|We were concerned because some of the negative ratings, but with 5 children, ages ranging 3 - 11, everyone was entertained!

B004PR71JC|5.0|My father bought the movie Rio for my 3-year-old son, and I thought it would be terrible (movie based on an iPhone app?  really?).  The movie was surprisingly fun and well done, but the soundtrack... well, I'm really amazed.<br /><br />Even if you aren't a fan of animated films, and/or you don't have kids this is just great music.  Enjoyable for all ages, and I love bringing the atmosphere of Rio into our home!<br /><br />Bottom line - buy it! Just be prepared to dance...around the room, in your seat, wiggle while driving... if you have a pulse you won't be able to sit (or stand) still!
0307719219|5.0|There is no question but that this book is a major contribution to the current dialog, such as it is.  As someone who reads a great deal, I have finally come to the same conclusion as Will Durant, Buckminster Fuller, and Russell Ackoff:<br /><br />INTEGRITY is the one word that matters.  If organizations, including political organizations, have INTEGRITY, the nation prospers.  If they do not, poverty prevails.  INTEGRITY is about much more than personal \\"honor.\\"  It is about being able to see the whole, connect the dots, achieve rapid constant open feed-back loops among all elements of the complex system, and so on.<br /><br />Nations fail when education is reserved for the elite, and the elite lose their INTEGRITY.  When the burden becomes too great and the masses rebel, they can either re-create the corrupt system they are bringing down, or they can branch toward a system of systems where INTEGRITY prevails.<br /><br />Below are a few of the books (my limit of ten) that I recommend in support of this book and the larger question facing all of us: just how illegitimate is the US Government and the two-party tyranny that is helping Wall Street loot the entire country, not just the Treasury, and what are we going to do about it?<br /><br />[[ASIN:0973769866 Philosophy and the Social Problem: The Annotated Edition]]<br />[[ASIN:0312174918 Critical Path]]<br />[[ASIN:303778198X Ideas and Integrities: A Spontaneous Autobiographical Disclosure]]<br />[[ASIN:0137071116 Idealized Design: How to Dissolve Tomorrow's Crisis...Today (paperback)]]<br />[[ASIN:0691150168 The Next Catastrophe: Reducing Our Vulnerabilities to Natural, Industrial, and Terrorist Disasters (New in Paper)]]<br />[[ASIN:0385529961 Griftopia: A Story of Bankers, Politicians, and the Most Audacious Power Grab in American History]]<br />[[ASIN:1605092762 Out of Poverty: What Works When Traditional Approaches Fail (BK Currents (Paperback))]]<br />[[ASIN:9211009588 A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility--Report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]]<br />[[ASIN:0465070108 High Noon 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them]]<br />[[ASIN:1591095204 The Tao of Democracy: Using co-intelligence to create a world that works for all]]<br /><br />Best wishes to all,<br />Robert Steele<br />THE OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING MANIFESTO: Transparency, Truth & Trustlity--Report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]]<br />[[ASIN:0465070108 High Noon 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them]]<br />[[ASIN:1591095204 The Tao of Democracy: Using co-intelligence to create a world that works for all]]<br /><br />Best wishes to all,<br />Robert Steele<br />THE OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING MANIFESTO: Transparency, Truth & Trust

B005ZKYXZI|4.0|I really wasn't expecting much, from this movies' fairly bizarre concept, but it was much better than I thought! The pacing was done well and then things really picked-up when the \\"kid\\" entered the story. What a force of nature he was and that young man will have a very long carrer if he keeps up this kind of performance.<br /><br />The picture quality is razor sharp and then there's the surround sound. The entire range of sound is on exhibition here. When the robots are walking and/or fighting the bass really takes off and it is deep. Also the midrange drivers & tweeters get a full workout as well. The hole movie is a touching story with reffernce level audio and video to make me a very happy audiophile.

B001RCD2DW|4.0|I owned a Sennhesiser hd570 for about 12 years (had since college) and about a years or so the sound quality started to dissipate badly.  The bass that was once strong got loose and the high or treble was cracking, I was getting ear fatigue.  I wanted to try anther brand like Grado, which I consider 12 years ago, but after reading all the reviews here on amazon took a leap of fate and just got it.  I couldn't be happier, it is exactly like my Senn 570 but better.  I took my old ipod into a Magnolia HiFi and tested the [[ASIN:B000J1N3HW Grado Prestige Series SR325is]] and [[ASIN:B0042A8CW2 Sennheiser HD 598]].  The Grado easy has extreme high and treble or what some people might call bright, Sennheiser is has a tad more bass and over warmth feeling in the bass.  I do like techno, classic, some rock, basically everything, so i need a balanced headphone.  Grado would kill my ear in techno if I listen too long, Senn didn't have the detail I heard in the Grado 325.  Well I do believe, but 100% correct since I don't have a 325 or 598 to test right now, but I believe this headphone is between the 2.  Almost as bright detail as Grado and a tighter bass of the Senn, perfect.  I haven't even burn in the cone, and it sound good the first time I put it on.  I think the Senn 590 took awhile too and like 6 years ago it was at it peak.<br /><br />Sound quality:<br />I prefer open-air headphones like in Senn, Grado and Akg.  I dislike the close sound of the power bass of Bose, Sony, beat by Dr. dre. While the sound is good it feels like I am in a cave.  I might consider [[ASIN:B003IHUHGE Bowers & Wilkins P5]] which is another bass emphasis headphone if I had a work headphone and needs privacy.<br />The AKG high and mid excel for techno music like Armin Van Buuren, the bass is tight but not overwhelming (nor does it crack like the old 570), I can heard the vocal as the Senn 570.  The high ambient is sharp and clear.  For classic like Bob Acri- sleep away (free in window vista) the drum and bass, piano score are all excellent again. For example JaRule's let ride, the bass is tight, but isn't as powerful or warmth/full as one of those Beat by Dre, or Bower headphone.  But I don't listen to hip hop that much, just for reference.  Soft rock or vocal like Julee Cruise- Summer Night sounds great.  I be honest, why I don't give a 5 stars to this 702 is it sound very much like the Senn 570 back at peak period, except the 702 is a little clear and sharper toward Grado.  SO overall it is my favorite balance of high, mid and low that I was looking for long period of listening before ear fatigue creeps in.<br /><br />Build quality:<br />it is almost exactly like my old 150 dollar hd570, the only noticeable exception is the headband is a tad tight.  Wished it was long or so.  The velvet foam cushion is like the 570, the detachable cord is the same concept.  Both are mostly plastic, bu the AKG band is a little different and also a tad heavier.  I give it a 4/5 stars too, because it is a tad tight and I notice it as wear it all the time.  Hopefully it loosen up over the years.  Cable is 2x as thick as the Senn.<br /><br />If somebody prefer the bright sound of grado, or the more bass of the senn, it is all good headphone.  I wish I had a bower for bass, senn as I am a fan of them, but if I had to pick one that I think sound the best overall to the music I like then it must be this 702.  for the record this headphone does not spasm-out on the bass like the senn 570 for enigma's Eppur Si Muove.  My favorite cd right now [[ASIN:B0016CS0IK Saturdays = Youth [+Digital Booklet]]] passed on all 3 sound levels with this set of cans.rum and bass, piano score are all excellent again.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After finishing Catching Fire, I barely had time to go to the bathroom before leaping straight into Mockinjay and devouring it.  There were so many twists and turns, especially towards the end, that I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to see what was going to happen.  I loved the ending, thought it was brilliantly done.  Readers who were disappointed with the ending are not realists.  You can not go through what all these characters went through and expect a happy ever after ending.  There are no happy endings in war, only victims.  These characters were all victims and Collins brilliantly portrayed how they were affected by the manipulations of those in power.  I felt like I was right there in the story, running through the Capitol, trying to avoid the pods.  When it was all over I lay on my bed spent, drained.  Katniss did the right thing because one dictator was just going to be replaced by another.  Things would not change that much, and she led that rebellion to the end.  The series makes you think about war and how it affects both sides, how evil us human beings can be, so power-hungry we don't care about the consequences of our actions.  If I was a middle-school teacher, I would throw away George Orwell's 1984 and rather make my classes read The Hunger Games Trilogy.

B0055CJ8T2|4.0|This is an incredibly put together album. I just wish that Kelly Rowland, the Powers that Be or whomever was in charge of this project could have properly promoted it. There are so many tracks that were single worth as well as deserving of video treatments, and it's a shame of how this project was handled.<br /><br />The album starts off with [[ASIN:B005CSX2NC I'm Dat Chick]], and it's a banger. This song was in collaboration with Ester Dean, and she has been on her game in regards to her writing and music collabos. This is such a strong and powerful song, and would have been great to hear on the radio. What a missed opportunity this was, but it will forever have a spot on my workout playlist. It fits well there. Some highlights:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005BW13LM Work It Man]] is a fun playful song that reminds me of a tune you'd hear in the summer while breezing through the streets in your car. That's where it visually puts me (or maybe that's where I want to be right now, lol). But Ms. Kelly is singing about the type of man she likes and would like to see in her life. It's one of my favorites on the album.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006O64KEQ Motivation (Chillout Mix)]] helped catapult this album in the minds of many. It's a really smooth way of instructing a person. That much I can say. And the addition of Lil' Wayne was smart. It's just too bad that the success of this track wasn't capitolized on, for it took a long time for a video to come out, and then even longer for a follow-up single to be released.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005CSX33G Lay It On Me]] Big Sean and Kelly were a good match to do a song together. This is a slick song that I liked immediately.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005CSWOWM Turn It Up]] is so hot and something I blasted in my car for the longest. It just gets you bumped up and doing what you need to do. An add on the playlist as well.<br /><br />Overall this was a pretty solid album; it just took forever for any of it to come out. I feel that a lot was mishandled when it came to this project, because this should have been a bigger success than it was. The only song I heard on the radio was motivation and that is a huge disappointment as a fan. I know we have to do our job by requesting her songs on the radio (as I did), but when there are huge gaps between single releases, or video releases (and from what I know only two singles were released), it doesn't show strength when it comes to the numbers. But on the basis of the ablum on it's own merits, it's quite impressive and I'm glad I downloaded it. I hope Ms. Rowland's future effort brings more success.it came to this project, because this should have been a bigger success than it was.

B003O86FMW|5.0|You know a writer is brilliant if they can take you out of your comfort zone and make you hooked on a story in a genre that you usually avoid like the plague.  Suzanne Collins is brilliant.  Her writing is crisp and action-packed and races off the page.  You can't turn the pages fast enough and when you come to the ending of Catching Fire - you sit there gob-smacked.  You didn't see it coming and immediately you need more.  You have to read the last one in the trilogy, you can't wait.  That is a sign of a good writer and Collins ranks with the best in my book.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I bought this control for my PS3 and never worked.. it does not link with console and does not charge.
B008X6N1OA|1.0|This movie was fantastic but i give it one star because it didnt come out a lot sooner.  Go to a place where 3D is free...  Sick-Flix.  google it.<br /><br />anyway this was a much better movie than the third one.  i loved it.  and the disc is going to include a few 3D bonus features including the latest and greatest looney tunes in 3D.  so i hear....or saw...whichever...
B000JFDBXO|5.0|One of the best superhero/comic movies ever! Worth the purchase!<br />If you can complain about it, let me know. Easily the best in the series!
B001A4LYN2|4.0|The is a well made adaption of an Upton Sinclair novel exposing the corruption of wildcat oil drillers and evangelical fundimentalist preachers in early 20th century California.
B007R41E8O|5.0|was a very fun &amp; interesting game.  the price was just perfect. it kept me intrigued &amp; the graphics were good. would play it again.

B0054TVW04|4.0|Very well written dissection on the powers and failings of Western Civilization.  Niall Ferguson is a fantastic author.  The book details the history of Western Civilization since 1500 and gives a background to its rise, and potential fall.
0345536886|5.0|As a longtime John Grisham fan, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised and delighted by the warm humour in \\"The Litigators,\\" a novel about the education and fate of David Zinc, a Harvard educated lawyer, who leaves a stressful, upscale law firm and becomes part of Finley & Figg, a small \\"ham and eggs\\" law office that specializes in ambulance chasing.  \\"The Litigators\\" is reminiscent of Grisham's earlier \\"The King of Torts\\" in its satire of lawyers who pursue class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical corporations over bad drugs in the hopes of striking it rich and of \\"The Associate\\" in the portrait of how the stress of high-end law firms affects the idealism and hopes of young lawyers working in them.  I found the humor \\"warm\\" in that Grisham shows empathy for the objects of his satire, such as Wally Figg, and I found the conclusion of the novel uplifting and satisfying.  I enjoyed the novel so much that I gave copies to my sons; I recommend it highly.
1401207529|4.0|The perfect start for someone just getting into Batman comics, or graphic novels in general. It's a thrilling, wonderful read that definitely draws the reader in emotionally. It is also very clear how much this influenced Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. A must-read for any Batman fan.
B007SGM084|5.0|Absolutely the best book I have ever read. I could not put it down! The entire trilogy had me intrigued and on edge! Excellent book!
B005DWA5KK|5.0|This is a great German silent film.  I really liked seeing the German actors of that time.  It's very clever and magical and truly ahead of its time.  Easy to see why this is one of Tim Burton's favorite movies.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|Having studied virology and epidemiology in the past (at about the time Marburg was discovered) I think this movie is an excellent and realistic portrayal about facing a virulent pathogen (think Bubonic Plague during the middle ages).  It shows the fits and starts and the messiness of doing public health and in-vitro research.  The human dimension of misinformation (some selfishly deliberate), confusion, desperation, and the family and peer bonds that hold us together is excellently developed.  For once, the human dimension of the scientific endeavor is well portrayed and I am thankful for the story of the good that those of us who have done basic research have endeavored to do.<br /><br />While some scientific shortcuts are taken to progress the story line they are reasonable enough to suspend credulity.  This is a scary and realistic movie and makes me wonder what a filovirus with the epidemiology of influenza could do to the human population.  Lots of food for thought here.<br /><br />This is science fiction at its very best.  It is so much better than those special effects movies that ignore basic physics so blatantly.  I'd put it on par with some of the best science fiction like 2001, Contact, Gattaca.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest! I have been waiting for them to make an app. It's is 100 times better than the mobel app, so I am pleased!
1423424514|4.0|This collection of tunes may only have 20-40% that you recognize but it is still a powerful resource.  I use it two ways: one is as a practice source where I essentially randomly open it and then page through sequentially playing tunes for 20-30 pages and marking (by turning down the page corner) those that I like the most - after a while I just move to the previously marked pages for further practice emphasizing tone and interpretation.  The second use is related to the ubiquity of it in that many small ensemble players have the version for the key of their instrument and it can be valuable using it as a base when small ensembles are forming.  Personally I like to have C, Bb & Eb versions available, in part because I'm a doubler, but also for more spontaneous settings.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really don't read but I had bought a kindle in January. When I heard about Fifty Shades Of Gray I will give it try. Read all 3 and loved every minute of them. Excellent!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The books are awesome...I loved them all!! I couldn't put them down:) I borrowered the first two and then had to purchase the third one cuz she wasn't done with that one yet!! I am hooked and hope there is more to come or a movie!!!!
0307949486|4.0|Slowly we are introduced to the Vanger family, which will bring Salanger and Blomkvist for a family mystery. As the story picks up back and forth we are introduced to the present life of Salanger (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) and Blomkvist (journalist). Both are struggling with their lives.<br /><br />The book moves really slow in the beginning. I even put the book away for a while after reading the first chapter. Then I watched the original movie on the book it became easier to read and to picture the people in the story. It picks up through the middle but then when you feel like \\"Is this ever going to end?\\". It just goes on and on.<br /><br />I enjoyed it for probably the shock entertainment since some things that happened are pretty horrid. I would read the second book even though I feel it may have the same issues as this one.
B005CFWKY2|5.0|I had purchased a black pair of this same show last month and loved it, so got what colors were left in my size. Can't go wrong with this Croc style...I have a high instep and it's just fine for me. Plenty of room for my toes and my not quite wide sized (but NOT narrow at all) foot. LOVE THESE!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I love this Trilogy. I am reading book 3 & can't put it down. With all his shades, Mr. Gray is someone I'd like to meet.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I teach students who have a diagnosis of autism. Angry Birds is the next best thing to having an iPad...which I do not have for my classroom.

B00846REIS|5.0|So well written. A good glass of wine and this book...a definate keeper for my kindle... Will recommend to my friends
B005LAII3A|5.0|I've seen both movies and liked this one one hundred percent better than the original. I also<br />think Colin Farrell did a better job than Arnold and certainly the two ladies, Kate and Jessica<br />outdid anyone in the first one. Awesome action non-stop. Made this movie go so quickly I wanted<br />to stay and watch it again. Will definitely be adding this to my movie library when it is available.
1433503794|5.0|After reading reviews here and elsewhere, I was hesitant to buy this Bible. I liked all the features other reviews described. My main concerns were the quality of the paper and the issue of \\"bleeding\\" through the pages.  I chose the TruTone,Portfollio Design because one review mentioned that the page quality was a little better in this edition.  I was quite pleased when I opened the Bible for the 1st time.  I found the paper to be very comparable to that used in other Bibles. While there is some bleed through, mostly of the color maps and charts, I feel it is very minimal and does not distract from the quality of the Bible.  While the Amazon description mentions \\"imitation leather\\" (which clearly is not the case), one review described it more as cardboard, I feel that the best view is a combintation of the two.  I checked the box very carefully, and I could not find \\"imitation leather\\" anywhere on the box. I also did not notice those words on the Bible itself. Again, the cover does not diminish the quality of the product. I actually think the cover is very attractive. This Bible is designed to last a lifetime and comes with a guarantee \\"during normal use\\". Another benefit is free access to the ESV Online Study Bible.  Bottom line, I am pleased with this product and would recommend it.
0670022950|3.0|The discovery that the twentieth century was not the one with the top body count is at once surprising and opportune. When someone says \\"We're living through terrible times!\\" it is not unusual that he has a hidden agenda, one that bestows more power to him and less freedom to the rest of us. Now Mr. Pinker affirms that we live in the best times until now. A merit.<br /><br />Now the demerits:<br /><br />a) Mr. Pinker establishes a thesis and endeavors to invalidate all evidence produced by the other side. Good for a lawyer, not for a scientist. A huge swathe of the book is spent affirming why all the data that contradicts his conclusions (and there are a lot of it) are not valid. In the first chapter he uses phrases like \\"I want to convince you\\" - hey, I am not in a Grand Jury. Do not try to convince me, seek the truth;<br /><br />b) Imagine a product that is cheap to produce, expensive to buy, sells in large quantities, and the consumers are so eager that they barely take notice of the price, and you have a definition of weaponry. War is good for profit, a truism that Mr. Pinker refuses to acknowledge, with a firmness that would amuse the CEOs of Lockheed and General Dynamics - although the victims of the weapons they make are less likely to smile about that. Commerce might not be so gentle, after all;<br /><br />c) The downplaying of the role developed by the economy constitutes a major flaw. Ideas do matter, but not that much. If ideas were all, the industrial revolution would have happened when Hero of Alexandria discovered steam power, four hundred years BCE. I admire the writers of the Enlightenment, but they did not cause all the changes Mr. Pinker credits them;<br /><br />d) All probably amounts to this - Mr. Pinker is a thinker, and a serious one. However, he also wants to sell books. He needs, for that purpose, to be elegant, ironic, and full of certainties. Good for sales. Not so good for science.
B008XG1X18|5.0|thanks for making this I love it so so much I want to post pics and I love the outfits too
B006LSZECO|4.0|A great beginning and I enjoyed the point of view perspectives. However, part two was predictable at the same time I couldn't put the book down! And I was a bit surprised at the ending! A good read.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|I had high expectations for this move and it did not come close to meeting them. Spoiler alert! I talk about some things you might not want to read.<br /><br />Action: B<br />The pace of the movie was all wrong and it was way too long for what you got. Some parts really seem to drag out, and just when you think things are finally picking up, they slow down again without any heart racing climax.<br /><br />Music: D<br />I don't even think it was the same soundtrack as previous movies. There were no intense moments where the music kicked in and I was like: \\"Yes! This is Bourne! This moment right here is proof that this is the best spy series ever made!\\"<br /><br />Cool spy stuff: C-<br /> Remember Jason Bourne taking over the U.S. Embassy, grabbing the map, taking the earpiece, outsmarting his enemies? There weren't many of these moments which is surprising since Aaron Cross was supposed to be super smart from his brain chemicals.<br /><br />New Bourne: C<br />It is hard to judge Renner's performance because I did not like the character Aaron Cross. They gave him way too much personality. I mean come on, aren't \\"assets\\" supposed to be trained killer, human cyborgs with no emotions? Cross was telling jokes and he was questioning the moral implications of his orders/actions way too much. Just shut up, go into killer machine mode, and destroy everything as efficiently as possible. That's what I want to see, not your ethical growth as a character.<br /><br />Fight scenes: B<br />Not as good as part 1 and 3, but way better than part 2 which had that weird camera thing going on.<br /><br />Chase scene: B -<br />A few good ones, but I think the producers are starting to equate the length of the chase with the quality of the chase. The roof jumping was something we have seen before (better) in part 3. The motorcycle scene had intensity, but I was kind of disappointed when Marta killed the toughest, baddest, assassin ever trained by man. We should definitely have seen a hand-to-hand combat scene or knife fight with this guy.<br /><br />CIA (Or whoever they were): C -<br />Norton was good in the beginning of the movie, but didn't bring it the second half. The woman CIA agent who takes over Landy's job of \\"quarterbacking\\" things gave a poor performance. I didn't find her believable at all, but that was probably because the actress playing Landy was perfect for that role. The rest of the intelligence crew seemed weak too. Someone dropped the ball here. This was something the first three films all got right.<br /><br />Overall: B -<br />Lecacy was still a good flick and I will probably still buy it on DVD. Had this been the only Bourne movie ever made, then maybe this movie would have gotten an A -. But by comparison, this movie was definitely the worst of the four movies.o-hand combat scene or knife fight with this guy.<br /><br />CIA (Or whoever they were): C -<br />Norton was good in the beginning of the movie, but didn't bring it the second half.

0345803485|1.0|I had heard all the hype about this book and thought it might be a good read.  However, I found it to be trashy and vulgar - not sexy at all!!!

B007IXWKUK|1.0|I found the 1st 2 books average, I bought the 3rd book over a month ago & can NOT finish it. I am bored to death with this installment. The entire series was predictable. I normally read paranormal romance and each time I venture out of that area I am disappointed. If you like C. Feehan & the Anita Blake series don't read this, it is a let down.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I thought it was an excellent book, particularly as I had followed what had happened to Jaycee in the newspaper. Truly astounding what happened to her and how well she turned out after being exposed to such abuse. Bless her heart as well as her two daughters.
B00846REIS|1.0|I LOVED Fifty Shades of Gray, and I was hoping for something as good.  This book I feel is just a copy, with different names and small differences.  I was SOOOOO disappointed and irritated.  Poor read.  Maybe okay if you haven't read Fifty Shades.

The second time I tried to open it I experienced the same thing others are talking about, it starts to open and then BLOOP!!!

I hope that the developer sees all of these reviews regarding the problem and decides to fix the app so we can get back to wiping out those creepy mutants:)

B0084IG7KC|3.0|First Movie was Awesome!!!! Book was Better but thats to be expected.  5 STARS  For the Movie<br /><br />I'm wondering how long it will take the studios to figure it out, WE DON\\"T WANT UltraViolet  0 Stars for having this.<br /><br />Sales of Blue-Ray's are down because we (the consumers) REFUSE to by the them if they include UltraViolet.<br /><br />We want our options, in my case iTunes Digital Copy.  It works on my old ipod, iphone, ipad and Apple TV.<br /><br />I can use it on a plane train or car.  No Data Usage Required. No secondary App to play it.<br /><br />One Stop Shopping, thats' what we want.<br /><br />Oh one last thing Joe consumer,  The studios are making extra money off you buying this when, you do not collect your UVVU Copy.<br />Don't buy it, send a meesage to the studios.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|have a pair of sennheiser hd515 which have a resistance of 50 ohms. with my iphone it definitely improves the sound a good bit. the base equalizer makes them thump pretty hard. its pretty darn small and the battery has a really long life.  overall quite solid purchase other than it looks like its cheaply made, so we'll see how long it lasts. something to note is that it wont make cheap headphones miraculously good. i tried using it with standard iphone headphones. only thing it does is make it louder. i even tried it with a pair of sennheiser hd 429s with a 32 ohm resistance and it didnt make a difference... so make sure you have headphones that can benefit from this.<br />update! i forgot to mention, the 3.5mm that it came with are terrible they broke in less than a month. luckily i had a longer one i use.

B002RI9TB4|5.0|Brilliant writing and story. Set in Nigeria and written by a Nigerian this is fiction at its best, Nigerian, African, or international--it's up there with the best now (and probably long into the future). Although it's fiction, to understand a little more about the history of Nigeria, read this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. very excited there is finally a good app for it on my kindle. works good and looks good. haven't had any issues with it.
B000SEIK2S|2.0|i purchased this book due to its high ratings from a lot of readers.  However, if all you want out of your science fiction reading is a jarhead in the trenches shoot-em-up, then here you go. It's not that i dislike a good blasters blazing yarn, but i like a little more depth than that. Apparently all the intelligent species in the galaxy, including us, are bezerkers with only militaristic development and a penchant for eating each other. The author does excel in creating plausible technologies for warfare, but not much else.  If you want a creative look into interesting societies, alien or human, disfunctional or harmonious; or a creative look into the ecology of a planet and the effect of that ecology on the actions and the beliefs of its intelligent species, then you will find this book flat and comparable to a first person shooter game.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, a lot of folks like that kind of read.  Perhaps Amazon should refine its rating system to account for large differences in taste.
B005DI9906|5.0|Been waiting for this to come back on the market for sale. Very happy with the purchase and the product.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great addition to my kindle. Use it often; recommending to all my peeps. Would recommend to not have a word minimum on ratings; very annoying!!!!
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I loved this book! I wasn't immediately as enamored with it as I was with the Kite Runner, but the further I read on and as the characters developed and intertwined the book reeled me in. The last few chapters are where this book shines, leaving you in tears, filled with joy and wanting more. I know this author's book's are works of fiction but they still seem to be an incredible snapshot of life is this war-torn country and the struggle the people have to find happiness and hope in such a vicious and hostile cycle of political and religious regimes. Both this book and the Kite Runner are must-reads!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I got this book because I was waiting for another book to come out from a series I was already reading. I had heard everybody talking about this book but I was thinking that it was not really going to be that good or that I was probably not going to like it, it is not something I would have just picked up to read myself. I was very surprised that I LOVED IT so much. I read it and the other 2 Fifty Shades books in less than 4 days. I loved them all and have recommended them to others to read.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The setting and the telling of the story is DYNAMITE!!!!!!! But the way the characters act is messed up. First Katniss is like not talking to Peeta then it PEETA,PEETA,PEETA the whole time. And Peeta's like don't go there yeah you love her and want her with you but she's going there to save your life!!! I mean it's a good book but just read it and see what I mean. K?
B004LWZW7E|4.0|The concept of time is relative...we \\"spend\\" it in various ways... The movie has an interesting take on the subject. We work for time and spend it on loved ones and things we need. Although our financial means give us access to improved medical treatment, and subsequently longevity, our lives do come to an expected end, even with unlimited financial means. The movie is good, though.
B008VNIA32|5.0|There is no doubt that this particular release is one that I have revered in the DVD format. Great to know that it will soon be released on blu ray.. Of course I am going for it. I do hope these guys re-release remastered stuff of such quality, even if it may not be as great technically as the ones that are being produced today. I wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviewer Mr.J.Ponessa on his views about this release and his ratings for the others...
B007L3BMGA|3.0|This was a very interesting read. There is not a lot of story line but the descriptions of the relationship that formed between the main 2 characters was captivating. Should make for a very intriguing movie.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  After I finished, the story seemed pretty unrealistic and the characters sort of one dimensional, but it was a sweet story.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Real Steel is a complete story of redemption and persevering courage! The story of an individual, who lost his will to fight for life is not uncommon. Finding a reason to engage, once again is something we all must find. Real Steel is a story about the underdog coming out on top. The film is action packed, with a side of compassion! See it, and you will agree.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|there are some fun games;however there are way too many pop up adds!! the controls on some of the games are terrible. The worst thing of all it down loaded in English then after a few games it changed into a foreign language! weird I will be deleting it !

B005LAIIQC|5.0|Director Tony Gilroy does a great job with the latest addition to the Jason Bourne franchise, emphasizing a gritty realism over the superhero flash of many an action flick.  Gilroy casts experienced competent actors that give depth to the film, and he employs a minimalist style that works with well the action scenes, which are by far the best part of the movie.  There's a lot of continuity with the last movie of the franchise, and subtle twists that suggest that the sequels will be much darker and much more global.<br /><br />By the way, the Bourne movies have very little relation to the Robert Ludlum series.  If you enjoy the movies, you ought to check out the books as well -- entertaining reads.
0439023521|3.0|That I'm an \\"older reader\\" who cares very deeply about what's replacing Lord of the Flies in 10th Grade English as \\"the morally challenging novel\\"? That I'm not going to compare the two books? That I'm looking for things to read my grandchildren? (No: not this, not yet.) And that I'd give it 3.5 stars if amazon.com would only let me?<br /><br />All that's accurate, but this will simply be a straight up comment on what I found to be a surprisingly appealing, often gripping, and sometimes moving young adult yarn. For me - given the right reading material, I can be a sentimental, foolish, fond old man - as long as I didn't stop to ponder but just let the story roll over me like a Saturday-matinee movie, The Hunger Games worked fairly well for some three-fourths of the way through. Then, with too many rabbits being pulled too frequently out of too many hats, it became a (bloody, but not obscenely so) Saturday morning cartoon, oozing its way along to a predicable, but nevertheless satisfying, conclusion, and then some.<br /><br />But as long as the story ripped along, I liked Suzanne Collins' pacing, telling us just what we need to know only when we need to know it, and interspersing introductions to a fairly stock range of sympathetic-to-despicable characters, who give the interesting, attractive (but who knows it? she doesn't think so) resourceful (of course!) young heroine Katniss Everdean something varied to react to, thereby to define her character for us. In fact, I liked Katniss a lot (and Rue, too) - I think Katniss might even grow up to be something very like Lizabeth Salander, a dark avenger - Peeta a little less, and I liked the tension over variously motivated characters that Collins builds into the story. (I haven't seen the film but greatly look forward to seeing whether it succeeds as well as the book in creating nerve-wracking anxiety over fundamental \\"who can I trust?\\" issues. I found that cluster of worries handled very, very adroitly by Collins.)<br /><br />I also enjoyed the moral quandaries Collins thrusts upon her young readers, asking them to confront questions of right and wrong, at the existential level, in the starkest of contexts. If the author is sufficiently skillful in drawing the reader in, playing the \\"what would YOU do?\\" game creates a deeper involvement with the story and makes the material grip harder. One is forced to wonder, however - spoiler? nah: just a musing -  one wonders why everyone goes along, like Orwell's Eloi, with the murderous, dehumanizing games, why it never occurs to the majority of \\"Tributes\\" - or even a small, rebellious sub-subset - to try and take over the game, gang up on and dispose of the bullies, then go on strike, trying to exert some muscle of their own, despite the stacked odds. In the end, Collins' rationale for the games and the compliance of the Tributes isn't very compelling, and that's part of my problem with the last quarter of the book, which then - finally, when you do stop to ponder - feeds back into, and recolors, the first three-quarters.<br /><br />Because Collins' silly, post-apocalyptic North America, Panem, is almost wholly unbelievable, a  dystopic cartoon state that might have been dreamed up by Ayn Rand on crack. But of course if we have no silly, murderous, authoritarian, plutocratic, crypto-Roman Panem (with its profusion of ridiculous Roman given names - I know: it's post-apocalyptic, the world has de-evolved, regressed, whatever, we're back in a North American version of Nero's Rome, bloody games and all) - we have no pretext for a \\"most dangerous game\\" scenario, and thus no book.<br /><br />But, perhaps most important of all and trumping those reservations about the story: as Shakespeare (!!!! Here? I sincerely apologize, but I really do have a point) demonstrated in his \\"romances\\" or \\"romantic fantasies\\" at the end of his career as a playwright, you can put people into absolutely absurd situations (\\"Pericles, Prince of Tyre,\\" \\"The Tempest,\\" \\"TheWinter's Tale\\") and, at the end, if those people are written as compelling human beings - and they were, and Collins more or less does - then the very human emotions that play out against even the loopy backdrops nevertheless move audiences powerfully. Human emotion is human emotion, easily recognizable as genuine or not in any type of writing, and Suzanne Collins, in my reading, succeeds in pulling the right strings.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'll continue with the series - okay, I probably will: I read all the Harry Potters (they were sooooo Dickensian...) - but I thought spending a few hours with this one at the beach last weekend was most worthwhile. (Hmmmm, I've almost talked myself into adding another star...)Winter's Tale\\") and, at the end, if those people are written as compelling human beings - and they were, and Collins more or less does - then the very human emotions that play out against even the loopy backdrops nevertheless move audiences powerfully. Human emotion is human emotion, easily recognizable as genuine or not in any type of writing, and Suzanne Collins, in my reading, succeeds in pulling the right strings.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'll continue with the series - okay, I probably will: I read all the Harry Potters (they were sooooo Dickensian...) - but I thought spending a few hours with this one at the beach last weekend was most worthwhile.

007174889X|5.0|Harrison's is a 2-volume 2012 18th edition of this respected series is a standard in its field.  Readers of compendia of this sort will find comprehensive coverage of the state of knowledge and practice at the time of writing.  They need to be aware that new research findings lead to constant updating of the knowledge base.  While it is highly likely that the information in this edition is state of art, there is the lingering chance that something newere is out there.  That is the problem with printed text in a field of knowledge that can never be truly 'final'.  Harrison's tries to compensate for this by including with the set a DVD filled with hands-on information for the practitioner that is coupled with an invitation to subscribe to a service that brings constant updates to the field.  General non-practitioner users of Harrison's are unlikely to subscribe to this service and need to rely of their own internal medicine specialist to remain up-to-date with ongoing developments.  For example, 'swine flu' does not appear as a covered topic, even though media reports are likely to refer to the infection in this way.  The scope of the set is immense, while comprehensive indexing makes most of it readily accessible.  I purchased a supposedly used copy but was not able to distinguish it from new stock in a specialty bookstore.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I am one of those music lovers that moves from band to band, from album to album, from song to song very quickly - in fact, I hardly ever buy an entire album because I never like the entire album.  That is not the case with Of Monsters and Men's My Head is an Animal.  I love this album, I love this band.  It works together as a cohesive piece. I haven't tired of it, at all. I picked it up for an incredibly low price on Amazon, and I wish I had paid more.
0786955716|4.0|I love the dungeon tiles master sets.  They come with a great box that you can use for big open areas, they store about twice as many tiles as they come with, and they collect some of the best tiles from the other sets.  A lot of people whine about how this doesnt have all the tiles they need, but it does have a good variety, and you can fill in the rest with homemade/hand drawn tiles.

B008FH6SUQ|5.0|been a huge fan of his ever since the first cd, i have all of his albums. bought this @ bestbuy, great dance, r & b and pop all meshed into a great album!! i wish people would stop judging him on his personal life and focus on his career and his music. god keeps giving him blessing after blessing...sounds like he's a good person to me. (hi chris!! it's luvmichael from mtv.com!!)<br /><br />in my opinion, the music industry needs chris. we need someone to help fill the void of good r & b music meshed into dance and pop, just like usher did.  i absolutely love: don't wake me up, turn up the music, remember my name.  again, if you want a good album to listen to, focus on his music and nevermind anything going on in his personal life.  his album reflects his hard work, and in my opinion, it's worth the money!! good job chris!! always got your back ^-^!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't believe this excellent series barely made it through one season.  For sci-fi lovers and non alike, this show had everything one could possible want.  The ensemble meshed immediately with each character being infinitely interesting, the action was crazy-fun, there was good humor, the plots were unique and interesting, there was a hint of romance, the violence wasn't too graphic......just an all-around fabulous show. I could have watched this for years.  It's so sad that it didn't make it. Big mistake, in my opinion.  I think it would have gained a huge audience, as obvious just from the huge number of 5 star reviews here.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|But that one scene in there where the ship blasted off for earth and then blew up and crashed and then rolled over on top of Charlize Theron was absolutely incredible in it's scope but if it's a prequel to Alien then Alien was done some about 20 or so years ago and has been followed by numerous sequels so it doesn't explain as to how it's a prequel to Alien (at least I don't think that it is and if so then how is it a prequel since it does not explain itself?) I had a bit of trouble trying to figure out what the giant statue head inside the cave represented or meant but after I see it again on DVD and maybe see the extras then it might be explained? I remember the crew members of the Nostromo trying very hard for the aliens not to be able for the acid blood aliens to be allowed to take those creatures to the earth because it would be havoc if that happened, but at the end of this movie the alien now apparently has the capacity to be a half human like hybrid of some sort and more mobile than before so maybe the next film will explain some things that are missing from this one. It better be a humdinger of a film.

B0060MYM7O|4.0|Since the home video release has yet to come out I'll mostly be commenting on the merits of the show itself as opposed to the forthcoming additional features.<br /><br />While the show's writers did an excellent job of adapting the first novel (A Game of Thrones) into a ten episode season this time around the challenges were far greater than even they may have expected. Based upon the second book \\"A Clash of Kings\\", season two had the intimidating job of trying to cover a continent-wide war for the Iron Throne along with the continuation of Daenerys Targaryen's story arc within the same amount of time as the first run. Suffice it to say if you thought the scope of season one was significant this time around it's even greater.<br /><br />Unfortunately for hardcore purists who expect a nearly identical translation of the novel it doesn't happen as many liberties are taken with this season in order to make everything fit properly. The general tale is still intact but you'll find that quite a lot of content from the book doesn't make it into the season or in certain instances is augmented and tailored to get the general idea across but isn't as fleshed out. Season 2 also sports quite a bit of created scenes in order to support the inclusion of the character Robb (who is no longer a viewpoint character in the novel) as well as to support an entirely new series of events for Daenerys whose original story-arc is mostly left on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />Despite all of these changes and fixes getting under some fans' skin, comfort can be taken in the fact that season 2 continues onwards with brilliant performances from the cast, both old and new, as well as some awe-inspiring set pieces and locations (Northern Ireland, Croatia, and Iceland). With Sean Bean and Mark Addy gone there was some concern on both the audiences' and writers' parts about how well the rest of the actors and actresses would hold up. Thankfully quite a number of them stepped up to fill that void: Theon (Alfie Allen) finally gets some screen time as we see him struggle between his ties to Robb and his disapproving and cold family, Arya (Maisie Williams) has to use her wits and her lessons from her father and Syrio Forel in order to survive amongst enemies, and Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) in an unexpected way replaces Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) as being Joffrey/Cersei's main combatant as he seeks to bring the young ruler and his mother to heel.<br /><br />The second season brings other changes as well. For instance the overwhelming amount of nudity and sex from the first has been vastly curtailed. I think I can count the number of times sex happens on screen on only one hand and honestly that's perfectly alright to me. In a lot of ways the sex felt absolutely useless in the first season (most of which was purely created for the show) aside from possibly the attempt of the writers or HBO to attract viewers through such things. Now that a large audience is secured and critical praise is running rampant it appears as though the program doesn't need to feature it as prominently. Replacing the sex however is blood and guts. This season is a lot more violent than the last which isn't only a reflection of Martin's work but also indicative of the additional funding which the show received as a result of its highly positive reception. Fans will be ecstatic to see that Stannis Baratheon's attack on King's Landing actually makes it into the season (having an entire episode dedicated to it) in all its fiery, blood soaked glory.<br /><br />Overall the second season is right on par with what the first established in terms of quality. The acting is still great, the locations are beautiful, and the story-telling is gripping. Once again though - those that wanted a direct copy of A Clash of Kings will not be entirely happy. However those people can take solace in the fact that the heart of the novel is still very much intact and effectively adapted to the screen.<br /><br />If there is one flaw to season two though it has to be the number of viewpoints. Season one told its story using the nine different perspectives from the first novel - a feat made a little easier for the show in that many of them were actually together in the same place (though thinking and doing different things). Season two on the other hand pulls from nine characters once again but also stays with Robb who is only referenced to by others or appears in dialogues with Catelyn in the book. On top of this most of the characters are on their own as opposed to a couple being in one place and others being somewhere else. The result of this is a lot of transitions within a single episode. Although the shifts are still fluid and not confusing at all it makes for potentially disappointing episodes if your favorite character or story-arc only gets shown for about seven minutes out of an hour. This is also undoubtedly the reason why so much from the source material either gets severely cut-down or left out entirely.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Movie is in great old \\"style\\" color, very nice to see it again after so many years. This makes the movie \\"atmospheric\\" and mor enjoyable for this type of movie. It isn't modern or new looking except the fact is that it is a technological feat to accomplish this. The fact that you can't see how it's done is a tribute to how well it is done. Just like a good illusion....
B001HNE3NO|3.0|Written in two voices, the reader goes from the past, Sarah's story, to the present, Julia's story. Julia's interest in the Jewish Vel'd'Hiv roundup in France during WWII, opens the eyes for many to begin to remember those who were taken to the camps to never return. Sarah's \\"heavy\\", tragic story is balanced with Julia's story of compassion.  De Rosnay, did not attempt to write an historical novel, but the round up in Paris did happen, and she brought the event alive by making the characters and the events seem real. Sarah's Key has tragedy, compassion, mystery, survival, bravery and resolution themes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book I wish Katniss was my sister not prims any who if you did not read this book you crazzy it is so thrilling and heart pounding this book will keep you up aaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllllllllll night
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Bought this book because everyone was talking about it and rated it highly.  My sons said it was porn and they were right.  Wasn't even a good love story to keep you interested and although not a feminist found it very sexist and surprised it had been written by a women.  Kept turning the pages hoping it might get better but it didn't, so gave up.  First time I haven't finished a book.  Since moving on with my reading material I am not surprised to find that many of my friends shared my view after reading the book.  The publicity though I am sure has increased sales.
B007X15GRQ|4.0|Contraband wasn't a great movie ,yet you'll find it enjoyable. When they made this movie they did it without a lot of sex and using the F word to get a point across throughout the movie. It had a plot and to the point which is refreshing in this day and age. I'm glad I watched it,even after seeing it only had a 3 star rating.

B007RTAR64|3.0|I pre-ordered the doll for my daughter who turned 11 few days ago. She is a total fan of anything to do with \\"Hunger Games\\". After waiting since May for the doll's arrival, she was totally ecstatic to receive the doll finally. Anway, the excitement quickly turned to disappointment in matter of minutes. As soon as she opened the box and took out the doll, Katniss's right arm fell off!!!!! I took a closer look and noticed a crack at the hinge on the elbow. So basically the arm was joined at the elbow with half a hinge. No wonder it fell off!! Anyway, I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement which I will receive on Tuesday even though we have prime shipping. It is Thursday 10pm right now. So... I now have an 11 year old girl, who has been waiting for this doll for 3 month, had it in her hand for 2 minutes and now since I have to return the doll, and the wait begins again. *sigh* Oh and I was charged $29.95 also and they will refund me $5 to my credit card. They said it should have been automatically done and they don't know why it didn't do so. Maybe there was a computer glitch. I would be very careful to inspect the new doll once it comes to make sure the hinges are not broken.

0345803485|3.0|I finally caved in and bought this trilogy after hearing my friends talk so much about it. This is the first novel of its genre that I've read so I can't really comment on how it holds up against others, but I was a little disappointed with the overall quality of writing. Like other reviewers stated, there were just too many British-isms. Would it have killed the author to really research and use American phrases? The overuse of British wording just detracted from the plot for me and made it feel unrealistic. There was also a lot of repetition throughout the novel, especially in describing the characters; come on, we don't need to keep reading how bossy Katherine is, or what Christian smells like or how gray his eyes are. It just felt like the author wrote this on a deadline and didn't bother to proofread it.<br /><br />Despite my complaints above, I did enjoy the novel overall. I liked Anastasia, and her subconscious/inner Goddess thing was cute and even humorous. The \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" issue was interesting too, and I'm hoping that issue is further developed in the next novels. This would be a good book to read if, like me, you are new to the erotic genre. Just don't go into it expecting a masterpiece.
B0000039QA|4.0|Now first I want to say that I'm not a hater of Big's music or anything like that. People might think I am because of my pen name or whatever. Biggie is one of my favorites and I do think he belongs in the top 10 in terms of all time great rappers, if not, he's certainly top 15. But top 5? Now that might be pushing it. But anyway, he's up there with some of the legends as a great rapper but at the same time I feel like both LaD and RtD are extremely overrated albums.<br /><br />First of all, there was no need to make this a double disc release because half of the songs on here weren't even good. If it weren't for those songs and he just released the half of the songs that were good and made it a single disc release, then it would be a classic in my mind. But, he included a bunch of other crap on here that just ruins the album from being a classic which many people claim it to be, even with the crap on here.<br /><br />Songs like F*** You Tonight, Nasty Boy, Last Day, etc. don't even belong on here. The biggest problem I had with this album was that there were waaaaaay too many songs where it seemed like Big was going for more radio friendly stuff and so he got away from trying to make music that was strictly rap and good, and instead went for more of that pop crossover bullcrap. And in that sense this album is overrated because while half of the songs are amazing, the other half are pop crossover songs that are too mainstream sounding. After all, Big was huge after RtD and he wanted to make radio friendly stuff so he could sell more.<br /><br />At this point, I might be giving you the sense that the album is bad, but it certainly isn't; I gave it 4 stars (although it's closer to like a 3.8 but whatever). The half of the songs that are good, they are amazing. Like some songs on here are just mindblowing. N****s Bleed, Somebody's Gotta Die, Ten Crack Commandments were songs that were very strong lyrically and they were actually rap songs. Other songs that I mentionedbefore were songs that were weak lyrically and sounded more like pop songs than rap songs.<br /><br />The production is obviously great, it's BIG.<br /><br />So overall, I would say this is a good album, but not a classic like many people like to think of it as. If you look at just the good material on this album, then it's a classic because like I said, the songs that are good are extremely good. But when you take into account the album as a whole, there's a whole bunch of pop crossover crap that sounds too mainstream and I didn't like that about this album. I even noticed some of it with RtD, but it's exemplified even more in this album, probably because it is a double disc release.<br /><br />I can't quite say that Biggie sold his soul for riches considering that there were quite some amazing, hardcore songs on here, but it looks like he was on his way to doing that if he had a longer career. People just think of him and this album so highly because he is dead. But it is quite obvious that he went for more pop crossover, mainstream sounding, and radio friendly songs on this album and that's why this is one of the most overrated albums of all time in my opinion. Way to many songs that have the qualities mentioned in the previous sentence.
B004INNRFK|5.0|This is a very high quality performance and production.  All of the artist are at the top of their game.  The sound technians has got to be the best in the business.

B0041T52S6|4.0|I have a confession to make. Please don't judge me for it, but...I never read Bryan Lee O'Malley's Scott Pilgrim series. I know, I know, blasphemy! I would see it in the comic shop, it would be recommended for me on Amazon.com, and people just said, \\"Joe, check it out.\\" But I just passed it on by.<br /><br />Then I heard a movie was coming out based on the series. Still, no interest. I didn't go see it, I had no interest in it, I just wanted to go my own way. Until recently, I probably never would have watched it. But then I got HBOGo, and lo and behold, there it is, waiting to be put on my watchlist. So I did. I put it there. And there it sat for quite a while until a twist of fate had me bored and not wanting to watch True Blood, or Entourage, or Band of Brothers, or the other 2,897.325 items on my Netflix queue. So I watched it, and here's my review, about 2 years late.<br /><br />Quick, a synopsis from Amazon.com! Don't sue me!<br /><br />\\"Game on! Scott Pilgrim just met the girl of his dreams...literally. But in order for them to date, he must defeat her seven evil exes -- a rogues' gallery -- including an infamous skateboarder, a vegan rock star and fearsome identical twins! From the genre-smashing director of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead comes \\"a true original\\" (Entertainment Weekly) powered up by wit, action and groundbreaking visuals that you will want to watch again as soon as it's over!\\"<br /><br />Michael Cera...suffers from Pacino disease. It's not his fault. He can't help it; it was forced upon him. I'll explain Pacino disease in a later post, but the gist of it is, the director said, \\"Hey, Michael, listen...I want you to go out there, and just, you know, be Michael.\\" \\"Be myself?\\" \\"No, be Michael Cera, the quiet, quippy, guy should never get the girl but does Michael, you know?\\" \\"But won't I be typecast? I mean, between Superbad, Arrested Development, Juno, and that other one with Kat, I think I might be pigeon-holing myself.\\" \\"No, it will be great.Do it.\\" \\"Okay.\\"<br /><br />The thing of it is, even though I sound like I'm bashing Mr. Cera right now, I'm not. He does a great job of it. His humor, his timing, his longing heart-achiness...it's perfect and believable. Still, I felt I had seen it all before until the moment where he started to kick ass. And kick ass he did. Everyones. At the moment of the first fight, bam, I was hooked.<br /><br />What really hooked me on this movie, however, was not so much the story, and not so much Michael Cera, but the supporting cast.<br /><br />Kieran Culkin as Wallace Wells, Scott's friend and roommate...I didn't know he could be so funny. It was like he wasn't even trying. And that was the point, in my opinion. His advice, insults, and actions were so deadpan and funny that I spent most of the movie waiting for him to come on screen. Well done and a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Ellen Wong as Knives Chau...this girl was perfect. Honestly, where did this girl come from? She plays the idolizing young girlfriend so believably you would think that they found a Michael Cera fan outside the movie set and brought her in to play the role. And when this girl's love is rejected? Ms. Wong sure knows how to flip the coin and play the dark side as well. It's a toss up for me between her and Mr. Culkin for my favorite cast member in this film.<br /><br />All in all, I thought the whole movie was well casted. Chris Evans, hilariously over the top. Jason Schwartzman, well, he's Jason Schwartzman. Come on.<br /><br />Ultimately though, it's not just about what we think of the cast. What did I think of the movie? Here it is:<br /><br />Freaking enjoyable. Yes, that's a professional term, by the way. Before hitting play, I expected to be sitting on the couch, asleep with a pen in my hand as my dog ate my notes. But after a few minutes of doubt, I was hooked, drawn in, invested.<br /><br />The quick pace, the clever self-referance, the constant nods to the 8-bit generation, the flashback cutaways to art from the book...what can I say? The story of Scott Pilgrim was enjoyable, smart, well acted, and even better directed.<br /><br />So now I have no choice but to get those comic books...

Despite my gut instinct, I decided to put it on my HBOGo watchlist anyway, and watch it I did.<br /><br />I should have listened to my gut.<br /><br />The concept of a big year is interesting in itself, but only as a curiousity. To anyone not a bird watcher, it is hard to find the excitement in the competition beyond the fact that it is a competition. I understand the reason that some would find it compelling; I just think it is compelling to a very tiny member of the populace.<br /><br />Now, before we get up in arms, I know that the point of this movie is not about bird watching, or competition, or big years. The point that the movie makes is one of self-knowledge and discovery, of sacrifice and consequence. And I admit, to a degree, it accomplishes its mission.<br /><br />It just didn't make me care. And that's where the movie failed me.<br /><br />The attempts to show change and growth failed miserably, primarily because of their obvious predictability. From the second the last of the three main characters was introduced, you knew without a shadow of a doubt what was to happen to each of them. The only real question was who was going to have the Big Year.<br /><br />As for the actors themselves, you can't fault them. They did the best they could with what they were given, but even the best actors can't save a meager film.<br /><br />In the end, I was not entertained. I finished watching this movie only because I had nothing better to do at the time. At least I was able to read a few hundred tweets while I was at it. So, in summation, my one line review:<br /><br />This movie was not bad enough to actually make me turn it off, but it came close.

B003K1EYM6|1.0|If you read this before you bought this product, good for you.  Now you can decide if it is still the product for you.  If you have already bought the product and came here because it doesn't do what you want to do, you are not the only one.  I wasted my money on this too.  When it first came out, it may be a great workaround for iPad's unfriendly workflow for importing photos.  But after the iOS 4.2, which was out almost 2 years ago, this workaround no longer works.  USB drives will not be recognized by iPad anymore.  For details, please see the one-star review that has more than 800 people found helpful on this product.<br /><br />This brings me to Amazon, why do they continue to list this product like nothing had happened?  How many people got tricked and wasted money and time on this?  It is sold through 3rd party now which gives the return another layer of difficulty.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|the title was a good story and nice adaptation from the original series. but that was all my choosing, i was very happy with the condition and the timely arival of this product after i purchased it used no doubt. i am very happy.
B004UQ03P2|5.0|Before purchasing the iVisor I saw a lot of reviews that complained about the quality reduction and a sort of rainbow effect because of the screen protectors anti glare. First off, the anti-glare works incredibly well and it shows the instant the iVisor is applied; sure there is still some glare in extreme situations but if it is anymore anti-glare you probably won't be able to see the screen. Secondly, the application is very easy and I love the fact that it only sticks to the outer edges of the screen and not the screen itself. Finally, I did not notice any major quality difference once the iVisor was applied but it does darken the screen a bit, so I usually have my brightness up more than halfway. It is a great product overall and I am very pleased with it so far having it on for about 2 months or so. I highly recommend this product otherwise I would not be writing this review.
B007NESBK2|2.0|The production level is so low that I can go to a local Jazz Lunge and get more kick.<br /><br />The band looks like they failed to practice.<br /><br />Sade's voice was never the flagship feature of SADE, but with the fading skill level of the band, SADE is down.<br /><br />I have owned many SADE's CD and DVD.<br /><br />But, the curtain has closed.
0307951529|5.0|\\"Better is a little with righteousness,<br />Than vast revenues without justice.\\" -- Proverbs 16:8 (NKJV)<br /><br />The book's title is probably what attracted you. That was true for me, as well. While it's possible to start a business for $100 (I started my first one for $12), the bulk of those studied by Chris Guillebeau spent between $100 and $600. The point is to start small, experiment, and stick to low-cost methods. You will probably be surprised by how little the book actually has to say about how to keep investment costs down in other ways. That's because the book is mostly focused on personal services, professional services, and selling information products. These kinds of businesses are more marketing than investment intensive.<br /><br />Because of his love for travel, the book is also filled with the notion of using the freedom that a business can bring to move around and enjoy a better lifestyle. That, too, is true of entrepreneurship kept in perspective.<br /><br />The book's great strength is in lots of information about low-cost ways to acquire and make more profits from customers. It's one of the best small business marketing books I've read. I intend to recommend it to my adult education classes.<br /><br />The book is also helpful in providing a lot of success stories. If you are looking for ways to copy those success stories, you won't find the details here. You'll have to track down the entrepreneurs and ask them your questions directly.<br /><br />Although the book displays a strong counter-culture flavor, the advice is pretty much traditional business 101, except scaled for a start-up person with limited business experience.<br /><br />If your weakness in starting a business is marketing, you will find this book valuable.

B0085W6II8|5.0|Having been a long time Yes fan this Album would have been a great return to the Yes of old. Steve Hackett could be a great addition to the Yes band line up I have nothing against any of the past members, but he seems to bring new Ideas to the table. But listen carefully to this fine assortment of songs and you are going to hear fragments of Yes,  Old Genesis, King Crimson, and yes Zepplin. But also a new fresh sound that transends the other bands mentioned. I hope we hear more from this group in the future. Its good to see the talents of Chris Squire and Steve Hackett with some new and talented musicians. All I can say is check it out with an open mind.I did and I have been enjoying it ever since the first time I listened to it. Take heart there are still fine musicians making great music out there!

B004EPZ07K|3.0|I've read some other reviews of this film, but after having seen it myself, I have to say, I only half agree with what they had to say.<br /><br />I've heard the claim that the lantern ring creates matter from nothing; a power that only God possesses.  No, it doesn't.  They make it quite clear in the film that the ring creates constructs out of energy, not nothing.<br /><br />The movie claims that \\"will\\" is \\"the greatest force in the universe.\\"  Not only do I believe this to be false, but the comics, to my knowledge, didn't make this claim.  They insisted that the Lantern Ring was \\"the most powerful weapon in the universe,\\" but all that stuff about the green power being greater than anything else is clearly incorrect.  I can think of several characters in DC Comics who could make it tap-dance with a snap of their fingers.<br /><br />Issue has been taken with the philandering behavior of the main character at the start of the film, and I'm very glad to hear that I'm not the only one who saw the problem with this.  The movie tries to imply that fearlessness is the only important thing about being a Green Lantern.  That's false.  You also need to be utterly honest, and of course, guess which of those qualifications the main character lacks in this film?<br /><br />Hal Jordan himself (the title character) is easily the most irritating thing about the movie.  For some reason, they decided to make him not only energetic, wisecracking and extroverted (traits the character had in the comics as well,) but also dishonest, self-centered, childish and rock stupid (traits he did -not- have in the comics.)  Because of this, Hal, and every relationship scene containing him, got on my nerves severely.<br /><br />The villain, sure enough, is a growing, planet-consuming lovecraftian abomination named Parallax, which mutates one Earthman into a psychic elephant-man-looking character who apparently runs on fear, and consumes several others like the blob before he's eventually defeated.I didn't find anything terribly interesting or fun about this villain, and the \\"innocent people body count\\" he gets doesn't help matters any.<br /><br />I do have to admit that the scenes on Oa were pretty good, and the film's rendition of the Green Lantern Corps and the Guardians was very good.  I also liked the visual effects used for the power ring, and wished we could have seen more of that, and less of Hal trying to get back together with his former girlfriend Carol.<br /><br />On the whole, I wasn't pleased with this movie, although it did have some moments I found visually-impressive, which gave me a nice thrill in exchange for my time.  If I were to rate it, with movies like Superman, Spider-man 2 and The Avengers at the top of the scale, and movies like Daredevil, The Fantastic Four and Catwoman at the bottom, Green Lantern would be right in the center.  It's the closest thing to a \\"meh\\" superhero movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />Final Notes: There's one last thing I forgot to mention; Amanda Waller.  This annoyed me severely.  The actress who they got to play Amanda Waller is a good 200 pounds too light to play her.  What really makes this bad, though, is that there's another woman in the film who would have been perfect for her, if only she hadn't been busy playing \\"woman in distress\\" during the Parallax attack on the city.
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|Interesting start, quite a conundrum throughout most of the story trying to put the pieces together is quite a challenge in the end it makes sense I enjoyed the book and would recommend it.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Straight up - this is a great app - both in look and functionality.  It provides the data I want for planning travel and communication.  Works well on both my phone and on my FIRE.  Obviously the FIRE implementation is somewhat limited due to a lack of GPS, (and that is, obviously, not the fault of the software).  The alarm feature is excellent with lots of device dependent options.  Yes, it would be great if the \\"Geo Chron\\" like map could find its way onto a live wallpaper.<br /><br />For the few folks that don't understand the concept of a World Clock, (and therefore give this clever app a poor review) you have to wonder why they got out from under their rock to download it in the first place.<br /><br />A beautiful and clever app, well worth the small cost!
B007RKPO84|5.0|Kreator are back and more melodic thrash ensues.  This album far exceeds their last effort.  From the beginning to the end it's a solid , well written , well played and well produced.  If you like Kreator this will not disappoint. It's a very catchy album .  Title track and \\"Death to the World\\" are standouts.  The album was released in several formats.  I chose the CD/DVD version with a bonus track and 2 live shows!  I love this album so much that I also bought it on limited edition clear vinyl 2XLP.  Don't miss Kreator on their co headlining north American tour with Accept !! Great album !!!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|For anyone who is acting as their own IT department, this app is a must.  I never thought I would need something like this - then I had a router go wonkie, then my youngest daughter needed Wi-Fi in her room, then I checked into a hotel that had \\"free\\" Wi-Fi on the easter egg plan....  Simple and easy to use, even for relative newcomers with lots of useful information in a nice graphical format.  Adds are annoying but not obtrusive. A must for your toolbox.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|the sounds are nice and the timer is  great feature. The issue that lost a star is how the app constantly tries to upsell to the paid version and doesn't close when the timer runs out (even when the correct box is selected)
B004EPYZZ8|1.0|As far as the real Bethany is concerned, I strongly admire her amazing maturity and poise in dealing with the loss of her arm to a shark.  And while I personally consider spending one's days doing little more than surfing to be a mammoth waste of time, I can understand someone indulging in their life-long passion in this manner.  So, nothing whatsoever against Bethany or her family.<br /><br />However, I think Hollywood's execution of Bethany's story in this film is completely lame.  It is so chock full of nauseating cheese and crappy acting (mostly by Carrie Underwood and Dennis Quaid) that I quickly lost interest.  The way the story was told was predictable and boring and the way the characters were portrayed left them flat and uninteresting.  I really can't think of anything else to say, other than it was one of the dullest, lamest films I've ever seen.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman were good.  But the greatness of this Movie were the child and his grandfather.  Who has to be taken to an era of time that is now the dysfunction of households here in the United States.  Psychologist want to diagnose us and say that we have all come from some type of \\"dysfunctional\\" family raising.  But it is when we see the \\"dysfunction\\" as a normal part of the family structure that there are major problems.

0812993292|5.0|This book was a complete pleasure to read. The anti-heroism of Harold Fry is amazing and something I think we can all relate to. This book gave me some hours of sheer enjoyment because it is so well-written and it is a very soulful read indeed. There were quite a few points where I was forced to jerk out some tears of joy and sadness. This is a must-read for anyone out there. Old, young,male, female. I learned a lot about human relationships through this book, and it also shows us how people can change at any point in life if they so desire and make the most of their time. This could well be a movie in the making!

0757302661|5.0|After watching \\"The Business of Being Born\\", I was on a mission to find as much material on birthing my baby without medical intervention and I came across this book, HypnoBirthing: The Mongan Method. The book was written for the mother that is intending to have an unmedicated natural childbirth. It focuses on the facts of nature..one being that the human female body is designed and therefore capable of birthing a baby without intervention. I loved how the book spoke about the Laws of the Mind and how they have 'direct effect' on your view of what your body can do, specifically before and during birthing. My mind initiates the actions of the body, therefore, I can actually affect it's responses.  I strongly suggest this book especially for women who choose to believe in the capabilities of their natural minds and bodies...also, for those who have not bought into the medical system's fear based strategies to deliver babies.  The vast majority of women have the bodies capable to birth their babies and to do it with minimal pain!! I CHOOSE to BELIEVE that!!
0307949508|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />  I just finished the book. \\"The Girl Who Played With fire\\" by Larsson.  It was a very well done book. I will not give away what happened.  The characters got deeper and more intresting. The story had so much going on, but it was smooth to read.  I was always asking whats next at the end of every page. I would have not predicted the ending.  The humor, was great. I really feel that I lived the life of Slander.  Honestly worth every word. It is the type of book I want to appreciate every word. The book has every element you would want.  Just enough to make it juicy.  I am happy I read the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I picked up the first book, I could not put it down.  Wonderful, imaginative, fast moving, exciting read.  I loved all three books and fell in love with the characters.  I was on the edge of my seat through all three books, could not wait to see what the next page would bring.  My hats off to the author, very well written and entertaining.  I was sorry to reach the end.
0307592731|5.0|Short and sweet: READ THIS BOOK! You will not regret it! I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this book, and believe me, it is a page turner! It is so very well-written, heart-wrenching and so well worth your time!! If you do not love it, I will be very surprised.

When I chose this book to read I had never heard of Elizabeth Haynes, I realized this was her first novel but the title and the synopsis sounded interesting to me.  Let me tell you I have never been left breathless before like this novel has left me and the feeling did not leave me when I finished the book.  Thrilling is putting it mildly.  Wonderful!!!!

B002HH9TUG|5.0|I have been looking for a gamepad and stumbled upon this on amazon. Did my research and went through a handful of reviews before buying this. After I got the thrustmaster wireless 430 gamepad, realized it was very light and fit my hand well but buttons are a bit stiff. Setup for my pc was easy and the button programing on the gamepad was a bit tricky to use but after getting the hang of it, I can make any button do what I want. The analog sticks and the optical wheel and the L/R triggers are extremely accurate and has a great feel to it. On some reviews said the optical wheel was too stiff but its perfect if you use it right. After two weeks the buttons are still stiff and noticed the occassional glitch like it will press a button when I know I didn't. Think that's because the controller is about 4 feet from the blue tooth reciever. Who knows. I love this controller. Just wished it was plain black instead of a ferarri sceme. Great item for $24-$50.

B008PZ69M0|3.0|This is yet another film with lots of style but a modicum of substance.  It seems that the idea of large ensemble films with several independent plots somehow intersecting at the conclusion is in high gear these days.  Director Fernando Meirelles (City of God) gathers an international cast including Anthony Hopkins, Rachel Weisz, Jude Law, Ben Foster and others to play characters with personal issues, mostly about paired relationships.<br /><br />Michael (Law) hesitantly arranges for a prostitute while on a business trip in Vienna.  His marriage is souring.  His wife (Weisz) is already having an affair with a younger man.  His relationship with his girlfriend ends and she travels home to Brazil with stops in Denver because of a snow storm.  There she meets an older man (Hopkins) looking for his daughter who is about the same age.  She also meets an ex-con (Foster) who is a sex offender.  She decides to shack up with him for the night.<br /><br />I could go on and on but you get the idea.  It would seem the idea here is to keep the audience entertained by showing off some acting excellence. There is one great scene with Hopkins attending an AA meeting that fits the bill.  But we don't get much depth with any of the characters so we don't care much about anyone.  The film really doesn't have much to say.  It's not like everyone's issues are resolved.<br /><br />I'm not sure I understand the title because we don't really end up in the place we started.  To the filmmaker's credit the movie looks good.  With scenes in Vienna, Bratislava, Slovakia, London, Paris and Minneapolis subbing for Denver, the exteriors are nicely presented.  This is certainly not the best film of this style, but not the worst either.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|Great movie.....from the 1970's.  Quite an interesting story and the basic story line could still be applicable in the future.  Special effects are old fashioned but fun.  Item arrived in perfect condition.

0765365278|5.0|I was unsure about this one and must confess I have only just started reading fantasy again over the past couple of years. The Way of the Shadows trilogy by Brent Weeks awoke my interest in this genre. This book builds up slowly with some nice swift side stories here and there which will surely bring to light more elements of the Storm Light world in latter books. These sections also develop various sub plots and characters further and is quite innovative in presenting the overall meta-narrative. The pace can be a little tedious at times but the final 200 pages of this book are magnificent. I just could not put the book down. I don't want to give too much away but this book is well worth investing some time in if you like fantasy novels. Sanderson is a master of character development. 4.5 stars!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was good reading but I got pretty tired of most of the book being the constant sex.  I looked for the deeper story line and that was interesting although the author could have put all 3 books into one.  I don't really understand how this could be on the best seller list except for cusiousity seekers because it is obviously well written porn.

0345803485|1.0|I've come to the conclusion that the publication of this book by a major company is a conspiracy.  Men are threatened by women and are using this (horrible) woman's writing as a tool to control us and to take back any and all victories feminists gained.  I mean, BDSM is fine if you're into that, but what's shown in this book is abusive, not kinky.  BDSMers have safety words and usually leave that kind of thing for the bedroom - they can let it into their day-to-day lives, but they're WAY more adjusted and equal.  BDSM is a partnership, not a patriarchy.  Anyway, having a book like this published in the mainstream should terrify women.  Women should be asking, \\"Why the hell is something like this available to my children?\\"  Or better yet, \\"Why the hell would any woman desire to be stalked, threatened, and beaten?\\"  If something like this were to occur in your neighbourhood, would you not call the police?  Would there not be a case of domestic violence?  Of sexual harassment? Of stalking?  It calls for a restraining order, time in jail, and (hopefully) visits to psychiatrists and psychologists.<br /><br />The picture this book sends to men and women alike is appalling.  Women shouldn't want to have their lives dictated to them as though they were children.  Men shouldn't want to make all the decisions, take on all the stress.  Have we not distanced ourselves from this?  It's not the fifties anymore.  Women are working, even if they don't get equal pay.  Women are voting.  Women are slowly creeping up, but then books like this hit the shelf and it all slides backwards.<br /><br />Look at what's happening in the US.  Abortion will probably become illegal.  Next thing you know, they'll be taking away birth control and the vote!  And women will fall back to being dissatisfied housewives who legally can't complain about being raped by their husbands because they're nothing but property.  I don't know about other women (and with how many women like this series of crock, I don't know if there ARE any), but I enjoy what equality I have.  I enjoy going to university.  I enjoy the thought of being an academic and having my studies and research matter.  I enjoy the thought that I am just as good as any man, that I am a contender as they are in my fields of study.<br /><br />Books like this give out the message that this is what women want (especially since it's so damned popular and women are raving about it and wanting to be like stupid, pathetic Anastasia who ought to be shot).  Women want to be controlled.  They want men to stalk them and beat them.  Is that what you want, women?  Is that what you like?  You enjoy pain?  You enjoy feeling like absolute shit?  Well, fine.  When that happens, when shit like this book happens in real life (and it has, and it IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, if only you'd look at the number of kidnapped women - there was a man who kept his girlfriend locked up in a room, which is what Christian would have done were this real life and not awfully-written fanfiction), then you're going to be sorry that you ever liked something like this.  Because the real thing is nothing like this shoddily-written book.  The real thing is terrifying and painful and destructive.<br /><br />Think about that.  Put away the fantasy and think about what happens in this book, pretend you're in that situation.  Some guy you don't know is telling you what to do.  He's stalking you.  You'd be pissed, right?  You'd be scared.  Some guy you don't know is way too cozy with you.  You're going to the police, right?  Please go to the police.  And, for God's sake, forget that Christian is supposedly attractive.  He's got a mental illness or a personality disorder.  Any good psych student would tell you that.  What he needs isn't an obedient girlfriend or wife.  What he needs is medication - and lots of it.
030758836X|1.0|This book will leave you wishing you did not read or waste your time.  Beyond vile ending and last half of the book.  I will spoil it for the folks wanting to read this awful book but this is not worth reading.  This book leaves you very upset with the ending though.  Won't read another one of this authors book I can assure you.
B007STBUIW|4.0|If the didn't digitalize the sharks eyes being covered over when they attack then I won't be getting this on blu-ray until they do.<br />You think it'll be easy with technology that we have today or i'm I the only one<br />that thinks this way about it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great access to my pc at home.  Have used it with ipad as well as just as awesome.  Highly recommended app.  Not for security freaks since remote pc remains unlocked.  (Stop lookin at pr0n)
B00127RAJY|4.0|The workout is fantastic with this dvd! I only gave it 4 stars because I find Jillian Michaels to be very annoying. Of course, with any workout dvd, you watch it over and over and that alone gets annoying. But at some points, Jillian just seems so fake. I mostly use workout dvds in the winter months, so I haven't used this one in a while. However, next time, I will be watching it on mute :) Otherwise, it is great and a good price!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|very nice app...... very handy ..I enjoy this very easy....and convienanant it teaches you alot the Bible  in general... &lt;3
B0054JZC6E|3.0|just started playing. these are fun games to play. enjoy it to pass time. cant wait to unlock more games.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Unless you are an s&m voyer freak  I think you'll find this book boring , repetitive, and not worth reading. I kept turning the pages to find a story or a thread of a plot, but to no avail. Lady, don't quit your day job.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game me and my mom play it all the time we passed a few challenges but level 13 in the 8&times;8 seriously seemed impossible but I really do love the game
B008XG1X18|4.0|Will give 5 stars as soon as I can edit my pins, or at least add a link to them. Being able to edit my boards would be nice too. :)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|All I kept hearing about was how wonderful this book was supposed to be, so I finally went to the bookstore and as soon as I entered I was looking right at it on the \\"Bestseller\\" shelf.  I went home and immediately started reading.  The first half of the book bored me to the point where I actually looked for excuses not to finish reading it.  There is a legal contract in the book that appears not once, but three times!  I'm not sure if she needed to bulk up the book with more pages or what, but that is exactly what it felt like...filler.  Oh, and this is only an estimation on my part, but it seemed like about one-third of the book was reading the text messages/e-mails that they sent back and forward to each other.  It was neat at first, but after about thirty pages of e-mails I just wanted it to end.  I literally had to force myself to finish reading it and it felt like a chore instead of the joy that reading normally is for me.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment with this book has to be the words she uses.  There was absolutely no complexity to it at all!  Now I know that with erotica that most people probably wouldn't look for it, but when your characters are an English major and a self-made billionaire, you expect their conversation to have bigger words than \\"excitement\\".  If not for the fact that it has some adult themes in it, I would have expected to find this book in the teen section.  I kept reading thinking that perhaps it would get better, but it never did.  People have told me that the other books are better than the first, but then again I was also told that this was a great book.  I don't think I'm going to bother continuing the series for fear that I'll go from Fifty Shades of Disappointed to Fifty Shades of Upset from wasting my money on something that my niece could have written.<br /><br />My apologies if my review upsets anyone...this is, strictly speaking, my opinion and nothing more.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This was the best deal I found for such a great case. I have a 1yr old so this was the perfect case for me. It does everything it says it does, 100% authentic and I get a lot of compliments on it too!! I tell them to come check you out on amazon bc in the stores the price is to much!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm so excited you can get it for Kindle Fire now because its such a fun timekiller! I'm just upset because I cant download some of the goodies because you have to get them on Google Play.
B001HN6922|5.0|My kids are watching cars 2 as I write this review, movie came faster than it said it would. Movie was brand new still in the plastic, thanks .
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was completely immersing from chapter 1. Putting down was incredibly difficult! A wonderful book! The author is very descriptive, and the pace usually riveting. I love his sense of tragic irony in these books. The characters are also very believable and realistic. I loved this book, and the title makes more and more sense as the story progresses.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Great film and an excellent science fiction movie.  The special effects were really good.  I've not read the book but the movie has made me want to.  I watched the original trailer for this film.  Everyone has said it before. . . how on earth does the trailer represent the film at all.  So glad this is available on blueray but I would've loved to see it on the big screen. . . many of the scenes are absolutely epic.  Must see and must have for your collection.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I enjoy it! It allows me to know my local weather and international. I used it when I went to Mexico, is good for traveling.....
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this book and it's not that I'm into bondage.  It was interesting trying to understand why such a young women would put up with such a treacherdous relationship.  I'm still interested in the rest of the trilogy and hope to find out what Ana will will do.  There is No man that good is that good looking or rich enough to endure that kind of abuse!
B008N1LL42|1.0|Buyers Remorse! Do not buy this movie! Wait for it to come out in the dollar bin at Big Lots, and even that would be paying too much, considering the amount of time one has to spend watching it. Total crap, Navy (Armed Forces) propaganda. So many plot holes and things that don't line up it is pathetic. First, why don't the aliens build their ships out of the same stuff that the destroying balls are made out of? Obviously, those things can't be destroyed by anything. The first thirty minutes of the movie are total garbage; much like the rest of the film. Where did the Missouri get their ordinance? Unless I'm mistaken, battleship museums don't just float around with old missles, torpedoes, and powder charges. I can't believe I bought this movie. I wish I could take a dump on the DVD and mail it to the producers of this atrocity. Unfortunately, I streamed it. I'm not a movie reviewer, I've never reviewed a movie in my life, but this piece of crap has gotten me up off the couch and spurred me into keyboard anger and verbalization. Why did the amputee get around five minutes of fight time with one alien when it was obvious that there were around twenty of the aliens standing around picking their butts. One truck? Really? One truck, jumping around twenty feet in the air stops the whole alien upload? Really? And why do the aliens, who are clearly more technologically advanced than Earthlings, need to use our satellite dishes to communicate with their home planet? Stupid. Ridiculous. No wonder this movie bombed in the theaters. I don't understand why this movie did better than John Carter, which in my opinion, was a good film. The directors, producers, financers, crew, and actors should just shoot themselves in the head for inflicting this torment on innocent movie viewers such as myself. Actually, I'm glad I own this movie because now I have a way to punish my children without violence. I have to go now, and brush my teeth because the taste of this movie left an aftertasteof a stinking pile of steaming crap in my mouth. F U Battleshit! I wish someone would have sunk this piece of crap!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it. best erotic and sexy book i have ever read. it was a sexual awakening for me. it made me feel normal and that  desires are a normal aspects if life.
B0086DBE62|3.0|but could be better. some of the parts seemed a little off. julia roberts is amazing as always, but snow white is a bit unconvincing
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Well, I read book one to see what all the fuss was about. The end forced me to buy book two. After reading the first two, it's only natural to need to see the plot through to the finish. Book three isn't QUITE as erotic as the first two, but it's still steamy.<br />None of the books have a terribly DEEP plot, and pretty predictable, but it's a fun summer diversion.
034580404X|3.0|I loved the first book, it was really good, dark, sinister, very different. The second book was boring and the third one was just silly and too romantic, okay to read but just too over the top somehow.
0380729407|2.0|Well, I got it in my mind that I wanted to read some Ray Bradbury and figured this was a good place to start, and now I'm not so sure.  I have got some MAJOR gripes with this book.  First off, being that there is absolutely nothing believable about Jim or Will.  Not a single instance of these characters seeming real.  Secondly, the way that Bradbury structures sentences in this book has to be some of the worst grammar I have ever seen in a publication, major or independent.  The thing that really gets me about it is that this is pretty much an internationally love piece of fiction and I just can't see the justification of it.  Even the actual story itself, which is wonderful in idea, is completely underwhelming because of the way Bradbury writes this novel.  I still want to read Farenheit 451, I certainly hope it's much better written than this book is.  Not to sure I can honestly give this book a recommendation to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This solitaire game has several handy features that make it a pleasure to use. First of all, the undo button isn't limited to just the last move. You can undo as many moves as you want. You can even undo the entire game one card at a time all the way back to the beginning! Another great feature is the autoplay function. Autoplay allows you to make an available move with just a single tap on the card. It also lets you quickly check to see that you haven't overlooked a move by tapping on a card that you are unsure about and seeing if it moves anywhere. Even the ads aren't all that objectional. They range from simple static popups to actual video commercials that run for 15 to 30 seconds before returning you to your game. You can return to the game without watching the ads by tapping &quot;Skip&quot; or the back button at any time. My only real gripe isn't with the game or  even that it's ad supported, it's that the video commercials can only be viewed in landscape mode. That means that if you're playing the game in portrait mode, you have to turn your device on it's side to see the video.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I am totally confused with the number of people who write a review of the \\"ultraviolet\\" process.  The review is about a movie that has not been released on any format, and people are writing about how \\"bad\\" it looked on ultraviolet.<br /><br />Er, since it's NOT OUT YET, I do not think you can judge the quality of the copy.<br /><br />All that being said, Hunger Games is a wonderful adaptation of a great book.<br /><br />If you read the book first, you will enjoy the movie even more.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I really enjoy it and the songs that are on it. I was really expecting it to have ORINOCO FLOW on it, but it was not.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been waiting for this app.  I love that I can see and repin cool ideas and recipes. Unfortunately I am too busy looking at them to actually do them :)
B000002LND|5.0|I'm stuck in the 80's. This is her stuff from the 80's. It's in chronological order. It's not all the hits, but, it's the major turning points in her productions. Lucky Star to Like a Prayer. Vogue to Justify My Love. All those top sellers. The other greatest hits from 2010 is wonderful, but it sort of bounces around. This one is almost hypnotic to listen too. Also recommended GHV2 for the post 80's stuff. I do wish she and Elton would quit feuding. It's beneath both of them. They should get together and do the Lottye Lenya&Kurt Weill story. Think of that soundtrack. Mack the Knife,Lost in the Stars,Speak Low When You Speak Love,September Song, The Soldier's Wife,Pirate Jenny,Solomon's Song,Poor Jenny,Alabama Song. She'd be the perfect Lottye. Let's do a screenplay outline.Work on the dance mixes. Write me Madge.JD 136 Bellaire Ave KCMO 64106.I'll have my people meet with your people to set up a meeting. What'dya say? Surabaya Johnnie, take the damn pipe from out of your mouth!But, I love you so!
B0086700CM|5.0|I didn't know much about this game when I purchased it. I find it very addictive. Would recommend for anyone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally on the Kindle and I love how it works on here. Unlike some reviews, mine doesn't run slow at all.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|Great value for the $$$. Instruction manual is generic and is sometimes difficult to understand but Invicta answered all my questions via email. I still can't figure out how to set the GMT.
1419703692|5.0|As a fan  of Chris Nolan films, this book is a wonderful addition to the Batman franchise. A comprehensive guide to all 3 films, it is a good behind the scenes look at the process of film making.<br />Many many wonderful photos of the 3 films and a good read of the thoughts of the cast and crews. Especially interested in the Pittsburgh photos at Heinz Field. I sat in the hot sun for 12 hrs. Loved every minute of it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am very impressed and satisfied with this cover. The cover holds the Fire very securely in place and the screen cover fits perfectly with the elastic band holding it securely in place, both front and back. The standing feature I have found to be a great plus. I was ambivalent about that feature when I ordered, but if you use your fire for any sort of video viewing, then I highly recommend it. The Fire in general is a heavy product compared to my kindle keyboard, so any added weight or bulk has not bothered me.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love the different levels and challenges. My 3 year old really enjoys playing too. Helps pass the time or give me some quiet time when my daughter wants to plays. Def a great buy and would recommend to anyone.
0439023521|5.0|OK, who do I write a review for? Everyone has already read the Hunger Games. Wait, I forgot, I write these reviews for myself.<br /><br />The success of this book is pretty easy to understand. It's a pip. The good lead characters are all Romantic in the old sense of being morally good and fully formed human beings. They're individualists, morally resolute (to their morals), and disciplined. They don't depend on others. They're doers not navel gazers. No hipster, metro-sexuals here. No willowy free-spirited nature girls. Americans eat that crap up. And for good reason. They're the type we aspire to and the type that make the world go around. Yet, it's easy to write those characters as two-dimensional props. In the Hunger Games, they are drawn as complete human beings with depth<br /><br />But basically, it's a straight action read that borrows from The Most Dangerous Game genre but it's incredibly well written and paced it manages to heighten the reading experience by tossing on a patina of political meaning. This patina places the action and the personal drama in a larger world. The politics also makes the book seem like it's dealing with important ideas.<br /><br />I don't care if it deals with big ideas or not. It's a great read.
030758836X|3.0|The book was really good until the end. It has a lot of twists and it kept me interested until the end. I will not give anything away...but I hated the end. It made me hate the book and it was an unsatisfying ending that left me feeling the book was incomplete. I had to give the book three stars because the writing was good and the beggining of the book was great.
0307744434|2.0|I was very excited to read this book.  Unfortunately it did not live up to its hype.  I did not care of the characters. so could not even finish the book.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is one of the coolest little apps I have gotten for my kindle. Works great and the alert options are handy for what level you want to be notified at. Great price too, free.
034580404X|5.0|LOVED  THE BOOKS.  I WISH I HAD TAKEN MY TIME AND HAD READ THEM SLOW. I REALLY LOVED THE STORY LINE.
B008M36ER0|5.0|I was really conflicted about watching this considering everything that's come out about Mel Gibson, but I've been a life-long fan and loved Payback, which is similar in tone and theme. I have to say, Mel's still got it. As he's gotten older he seems to have really grown into the role of the pissed off loner. This stylish thriller is anything but by-the-numbers and Mel is pitch-perfect as the world-wearing grifter who just wants to get his score and be left alone. The supporting cast (mostly unknowns) acquit themselves well. Way better than you'd expect from a low-budget, straight-to-video thriller. If Mel keeps making movies like this, I'm going to keep watching.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|The original came out the year I got my driver's license. Back then a movie like this was an EVENT. You'll notice the Overture at the beginning, there's an intermission and, yes, the lights came up and you got more snacks and hit the restroom. It was real theater in 1966.<br /><br />I'm glad to see they put this on DVD. I've got a 65\\" HDTV and surround sound, so it's very much like being in a theater. Turn out the lights, turn up the sound and immerse yourself in the world of racing when it was dangerous and thrilling.<br /><br />Look carefully at what the driver's wear. In some states it's not legal to let your kid ride a bike wearing less than what they wore! They were a different breed back then, which makes it really cool that most of the drivers are the REAL ones---only the four main stars are actors. They they had to actually drive. They spent months learning how to drive Formula One. Those close-ups are real, on the track, at speed. No blue screen, no dollies under the cars. James Garner was really out there on those tracks at those speeds. They took the entire season to film it all.<br /><br />And for you younger folks, they had never heard of CGI back then. So, when you see a car shoot through the air in a spectacular crash, it was a real car! They built a cannon that could shoot a Formula One car and then actually shot cars out of it as they filmed. The cars don't explode and blast 50 feet straight up like they do in today's over-blown FX, but this is how real cars crash.<br /><br />You'll love the full-lap circuits of the tracks. Lights out, sound up, sit close, and ENJOY!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is set in post-apocalyptic America.  A place in the future (not too very far in the future)  where the government has finally gained complete control of it's masses.  The concept is frightening, the reader finds themselves very engaged in the characters pretty early on in the first book.  I loved that our heroine, Katness Everdeen, has a name that brings up imaginings of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  The novel is new age and dark ages blended into a tension that will have the reader turning pages well into the wee hours.  Even if you have seen the movie, don't pass up this read.
B007STBUIW|5.0|This restoration is not new!  The August 2012 Blu-ray release of \\"Jaws\\" includes a bonus feature about the restoration and shows how the beach scene, formerly yellow, is now bright and blue; how the scratches on the film when the mayor comes out of the building (chapter 4) were removed; how the shooting stars over the Orca are now visible...But all of these improvements were made for -- and are clearly evident in -- the 2005 DVD release.  Thus, the 2012 DVD version included in the combo pack is identical to the 2005 version.  And, with a Blu-ray player that upconverts, there is little difference between the 2005/2012 DVD and the new Blu-ray disc.  While still a phenomenal movie, the Blu-ray of \\"Jaws\\" is not worth it if you already own the 2005 DVD.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of those books that most \\"real\\" readers like to scoff at. I have to admit that I had my doubts that Collins would come through, but, man, was I impressed.<br /><br />This book was probably one of the most captivating, entertaining reads that I've had in years. Katniss is an incredibly strong, lead, female character -- something that is rather non-existent or not so believable in literature these days. And the story is terrific. You never, ever want to put the book down.<br /><br />Sure, the language is written for a young adult. And the reader isn't so challenged when it comes to figuring out what's going on. However, Collins just crushes it on everything else. Not to mention, it's not such a bad commentary on some of the ridiculous things that are going on in our society today.<br /><br />All I have to say is give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.
B000002ITW|3.0|This double album was one of my favorite CSNY albums as a kid, but I did not like the recording quality of this CD version.  It could be that the recording flaws are enhanced in the digital format or just my age.
B008MBXFEM|2.0|I love film score and have purchased much of Hans Zimmer's work.  I feel as though this score \\"might\\" have worked well in the film but for a score lover it is very sub-par.  I'm not sure if he really wanted to try some new techniques or wanted to go in a different direction than the previous 2 scores but whatever the motivation it didn't pay off.  With the previous scores you had strong movements of heart and soul, this one is lacking any of that.  I strongly dislike the remix tracks and the ending track is such a missed opportunity to go out with a bang.  In summary, I'm just disappointed.
0143038419|1.0|I have to say, I am an avid reader and I have never been so compelled to write a review (my first review) until after I finished reading this horrid book.  And believe me, I wanted to love it.<br /><br />As I try to think of something to positive to say about it, let me start with what was -oh so wrong-.<br /><br />First of all, I don't think it is well written.  The metaphors are weak.  The nicknames are stupid: \\"Groceries?\\".  Give me a break.<br /><br />The main character is anything but likable.  It is beyond transparent that she is trying to convince herself (and her readers) that she is self-aware, empathic and loved by everyone she meets.  Dead wrong.  I, for one, hated her.  It is the way that she tries to convince herself, above everything else, that I find particularly disingenuine and pathetic.  As she says, she is obviously still attractive to the Italians, she doesn't need sex, she felt the blue light and has been enlightened.. blah blah.  All BS and all a way to convince herself that she is a good person and lovable after being dumped.  She is also incredibly vain - she thinks that the medicine man will remember her and be so happy that she has returned to Bali (he clearly wanted some $$, by the way).  She tells the Brazilian she doesn't know yet if she can be the center of his world.  Ugh.  How she convinces herself that she can speak Italian.  She made me throw up in my mouth.<br /><br />Also, I don't see how you can transition from being a glutton (Italy) to being enlightened(India) without some sort of reflection on your own privilege and merciless indulgences.<br /><br />Ok - so something good about the book?  Still thinking.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I heard wonderful things about \\"Gone Girl\\" by Gillian Flynn.  I ordered the 3 books she wrote.  I'm reading them in the order she wrote them: \\"Sharp Objects\\", which I read and liked, \\"Dark Places\\", which I'm about 3/4 of the way thru, and not enjoying it like the first one.  I'll let you know about \\"Gone Girl\\"
0307454894|4.0|Michael Berg, a young student, falls sick on his way home from school and is assisted by Hanna Schmitz, a woman old enough to be his mother. Almost immediately, he is captivated by her beauty, grace, and seductiveness. Before long, they become lovers and spend each day together. Their days are spent in a comfortable ritual of Michael reading aloud to Hanna, showering with her, making love to her, and lying by her side afterwards. For a while, Michael's life is blissful, but eventually, he sees a fury in Hanna he never has before. Then, Hanna disappears. Michael believes this to be due to his betrayal. Years later, Michael sees Hanna again and realizes she is on trial for a gruesome crime. As he watches the trial take place, Michael realizes Hanna is hiding a bigger secret than anybody could have guessed.<br /><br />Though this novel challenges the known ideas of the Holocaust, it forces us to see the other side of the spectrum. The novel is shaped to prove that there are shades of grey to every situation and a person can't be judged, sentenced, and written off as easily as we believe. Throughout the novel, there are undercurrents of collective guilt and shame that the protagonist, Michael, is battling with. He feels an incessant need to condemn his parents for their turning a blind eye to the perpetrators in their midst. However, later on, it is obvious that Michael does not fully belong to the second generation since he is unable to condemn Hanna. He is still searching for answers through his numbness at what he has realized about her.<br /><br />At the heart of this novel is the love that Michael feels for Hanna. Even though their relationship changes in many ways by the end of the novel, it is this alteration that shapes Michael. He is completely changed by the guilt that both Hanna and the first generation have left him with. Schlink manages to create a book that is gripping and leaves us with an unnerving look into the depths of Germany's history.
0061245097|5.0|The second book in the Night Huntress series, One Foot in the Grave, proved to be just as exciting and amazing as the first book! When I started this book I really wasn't sure what would be in store for Cat because the ending of the previous book took such a drastic and unexpected turn, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised. But what is not surprising is that Jeaniene Frost has once again delivered a well-written, addictive, witty, raw and action-packed novel!<br /><br />In this installment of the series, it's been four years since Cat has seen Bones--having disappeared from his life in order to protect him and her mother. She's now working for a covert branch of government and her job is to take down certain vampires that pose a threat to society. With her own team of soldiers/agents to command, Cat is doing what she loves: delivering justice to the bad guys. She's the \\"Red Reaper\\" and she is fierce. But someone has a contract out on her life, and they won't stop until she's dead.<br /><br />I was eagerly anticipating Cat's reunion with Bones, and when he made his appearance I was pretty darn excited! Their fiery connection was still very present and Bones' determination to not let her go again was strong. As usual, these two make a fantastic team and they worked together effortlessly to track down clues leading to the person that wanted Cat dead. As usual, Bones is very protective of her and proves to her once again that he's the only one for her. Cat's realization about her happiness and love for Bones was very satisfying, especially because she overcame her resentful mother's influence on the matter. But if there were ever two characters that were meant for eachother, it's these two; and I didn't think that their romantic scenes together could any more intense and seductive, but oh boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />The secondary characters in this book are definitely worth mentioning as well. Some of the vampires that are introduced, whether they were friends orfoe, were pretty interesting. I'm eager to learn more about a few of them in particular. I also enjoyed the fact that Cat has several friends in this book, which is something she didn't have before. She has Bones, obviously, but it was nice that she had such camaraderie with the men she worked with, and it doesn't hurt that they're a humorous bunch! Oh, and I'm so glad to have gotten more of Rodney the ghoul! I don't know what it is about him, but I like him a lot.<br /><br />There is a truckload of stuff going on in this book, to say the least. Setting aside the romantic happenings and struggles that Cat goes through, she also has to contend with some shocking revelations involving her family, as well as some interesting information about the code and laws of vampires. All of this actually ties in with the conclusion of this novel, which was pretty eventful and awe-inspiring! So naturally, I'm pretty excited to delve into the next book and continue on this journey with Cat, Bones, and her awesome friends.

Worth the read.
B007H7XJD4|2.0|waste my $3.99. And i didnt like this movie at all. This director really needs to do some research on Greece Gods. I cannot make out that if Zeus destroyed the mountain, the Titans could not get out, but why he needed a big cage to cage them in the first place? And how did Zeus think Titans couldn't get out? I mean Titans are gods,too; they must have some power.<br />  In what way can i get my money back?
B0041CGOZS|1.0|I guess this is the \\"best\\" of Bon Jovi in the sense that it includes many of his and his band's big hits and covers various points in their career. That said, I have a couple of problems with this collection. One -- and I know this is subjective -- is that it doesn't necessarily contain the songs that I personally think are his best. In fact, my favorite Bon Jovi track -- the solo hit \\"Midnight in Chelsea\\" -- is missing.<br /><br />The bigger problem, though, is that Bon Jovi's music in general is incredibly pedestrian, VASTLY overrated mall rock. I'm not saying that everything has to be Chopin, Rodgers & Hammerstein or The Beatles, by the way; there is definitely a place in this world for mall rock. But if that's what you're into, there are better places to look -- Def Leppard, to name one. Jon Bon Jovi is a pretty awful writer and an even worse singer. One of the reasons I like \\"Midnight in Chelsea\\" is because his singing on that tune is uncharacteristically restrained. Usually, his vocals are heavy-handed. As for his writing.... I think back to a review I read in Rolling Stone years ago that started out by asking, \\"How many rock and roll cliches can you string together into a single song? Not as many as Jon Bon Jovi can.\\" Truer word was never written. It's as if this guy has never had an original idea in his life! Even the TITLES of his songs are often stolen from other musicians. \\"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\\" (not included here) was stolen from the late, great Warren Zevon, and \\"It's My Life\\" was stolen from Talk Talk.<br /><br />If we're going to be honest, there are two big reasons that Jon Bon Jovi has a career: his looks and his lineage. He's obviously a good-looking guy who's aged well and who appeals to the ladies. And his uncle was a successful producer. If you took these two things away, Bon Jovi's career would have been much more on the level of Jackyl or maybe Warrant at best. I know he wants to be taken seriously as an artist --  to be mentioned in the same breath as Bruce Springsteen -- but outside of being from New Jersey, these two guys have almost nothing in common. Springsteen can write, play and sing (not to mention he's a great live performer).  Jon Bon Jovi can't really do any of those. He just might be the most overrated man in rock and roll.
B003B0D2QU|3.0|Quite revealing and explanatory about Obama's beliefs.  His formative years were not in America, but in Indonesia.  He always harbored resentment toward races other than Black and Asian.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Keeping it short. The G930 replaces a G35. G930 is much more comfortable. MUCH. Decent sound (G35 may sound a little better) but the G930 does not crush my head like some torture device like the G35 does. Good range maybe 40 feet in my house. Worked with PC instantly. I use it with EVE. Works with Mumble and Ventrilo. I haven't run out of charge during operation yet, so good there. I am not using it in 7.1 mode yet (no need) and if I do I will update this report.
0307716511|1.0|Truth be told I only finished reading this novel so that I could properly review it. Overall I was bored, annoyed, and constantly aggravated seeing how many more pages I had left. It reads like a self-published novel (not that all self-published novels are bad, but some of them are never picked up by a publisher for a reason and this one should have been that). The author's chip on her shoulder, the constant info-dumps, the \\"all tell no show\\" . . . it was just bad. I also did not appreciate the author's evident belief that the reader simply doesn't know better.<br /><br />This is probably where all the fans will start clicking the button indicating my review was not helpful . . . go ahead I'm used to it on negative reviews (people seem to confuse that button with a \\"do you agree with this review?\\" button).
B000URWYTS|4.0|I bought Loving Frank after visiting Wright's architecture in Chicago and Oak Park. The description of Wright's architecture, community, and family life was rich and detailed. I was interested in the details of early feminism and the social history, in Europe and the States. The relationship between the couple was compelling. I disliked both of them at times and yet felt sympathetic and interested as well. I knew the tragic ending and found it difficult to finish the book, anxious about how it would be portrayed. It was an excellent read. I would highly recommend the book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Plays well and has great graphics. No problem running on my Android phone. Great for free game. Like the auto complete feature.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Okay, I haven't lost a pound, wait I take that back, I lost three then gained it back! I do each level for 10 days each as instructed (or assumed}.For level 1 I did it three days then maybe every other day. Was traveling a lot. Then for level two I did it straight through for ten days and then relaxing for the eleventh before progressing on to level Three. Level three is hard but fun and I'm on my Third day of it, Am I pissed I didn't lose 20 pounds? Uhm, yea. BUT! I feel and look different, I see muscles in my arms/back that were never visible. My legs and obliques are tighter and my face seems slimmer. Of course I had binge days on level 1 and 2; but I don't plan on this from no on. I also have a implanon (birth control), so these could all be contributions to why the scale isn't working (loL). A lot of people say this is more of a toning workout so maybe that's it too! However, over all I love this DVD! I would recommend it and I might do a round two. Just to see more results. Good luck to all.
B003IMMEKG|1.0|How is it possible that they did not include subtitles with this?  The poor star rating is for the BluRay, not the movie!<br />I am hoping I can return this without cost to me as the fact that subtitles are not present was not readily apparent.

0345803485|1.0|50 Shades of Grey made me weep.  It made me sick.  It made me think of the abuses of all of those kids by a demented, warped monster like Jerry Sandusky, who, just like the pedophilia of 50 Shades of Grey, was hiding in plain sight!
0756655730|5.0|I have been interested in paleontology and anthropology my whole life.This book is a must have for those who have more than a casual interest for this subject matter.DK did an incredible job putting this book together.The photography and illustrations are breath taking.Visuals add so much more to where we've been and where we are today and this book delivers.
B004U52VPS|3.0|This is a neat game and it's only drawback is one that should be apparent without even reading instructions. You have to set it up. I bought this to play with my 4 year old who LOVES playing on my iPod. I realized that my favorite part of the iPod version is not having to build all those towers. The little blocks need a sturdy base that isn't going to move AT ALL if you expect to build any of the harder structures. If you're getting it for a child, be prepared to do a lot of setting up. It's kind of like playing with dominos, you hate to knock them down after all that work.

B000244FDW|3.0|I think that even if I hadn't seen and loved the more recent BBC version, I would have found this one somewhat lacking. Of course, the comparison doesn't help. The Ehle & Firth version has the advantage of being longer, fresher, and better cast. The energy in that one works; in this one it doesn't. It is, however, still preferable to the Keira Knightly version which was too modern, didn't grasp the difference between wit and immaturity and was so wrong on so many levels. I don't mean to say that this is absolutely terrible, it's just off. It seems to be either a problem in character interpretation or directing, maybe both.<br /><br />Elizabeth Garvie is so calm, vague, and restrained that she appears almost medicated. While she's still intelligent, there is very little evidence of wit or charm. She just drifts from scene to scene as a pale and almost emotionless abstraction of the real Elizabeth while saying all the right things.<br /><br />Darcy is supposed to be stiff, solemn, and not show emotion and, in that sense, David Rintoul got it right (particularly the 'stiff' part). Unfortunately, the vulnerability and shyness that lie beneath the public mask is never hinted at, there is very little difference between the Mr. Darcy at the beginning and at the end, and you never detect any spark or attraction or sensual tension between the two leads, even in the last scene where they are walking side by side. He resembled a man parodying fashion models in tight clothes walking down the runway.<br /><br />The main characters are not the only ones that suffer from either misinterpretation or misdirecting. Mr. Bennet is portrayed as more irresponsible and spoiled than in other versions rendering him much less likeable; the warmth between him and Lizzy is not portrayed successfully; and both Kitty and Georgiana appear to be a bit older than in the original. Even Pemberley is a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />On the plus side, Mrs. Bennet is as flighty as ever but is portrayed a little more sympathetically. Jane, Lydia, Wickam, and the Bingley clan are very close to the original; Mary is as pedantic as usual but with a sweet smile; the costumes are attractive, and the photography is good when it isn't being even better.ayed a little more sympathetically.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome really nice you will never get bored with this apps its as if there are an infinite number of games
B000W1VDEY|5.0|There's not a bad song on here.  I had previously only heard the couple songs that got radio play; Working Man, and In the Mood, but I am not disappointed by the album as a whole.  It sounds to me a little less \\"progressive\\" than their later work, but straight forward Rock n' Roll is just fine with me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally a real pinterest app for android. As if I didn't spend enough time on pinterest already, now I can pin on the go! Great app, user-friendly layout.
030758836X|5.0|Really, I rounded up to 5 stars.....I truly don't want to give anything away, because it' truly worth buying this book...BUT SPOILER ALERT....I think the ending could have been MORE horrifying than it was.  And I only say this because the author is so talented.....she was able to keep me up at night reading this book & trying to figure out what the hell was going on.....she might have made the ending a bit more horrifying....The realization of this fate.<br /><br />But, that said - well done.  You really won't regret buying this book.  The author writes in a crisp suspensful narrative that will keep you reading till the wee hours & will uncomfortably make you think about your own marriage and all those little things you don't say to each other.  It's a mystery & psychological thriller.  As you relate to it, you are horriffed that you do, and at the same time will be thinking...\\"What the hell happened?\\".  Buy it.  It's good.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This little boy does improve your music listening experience. The battery life is rated 10 hours. I use it for a week (using it every day for a couple of hours) and have to charge it only once, so I think that's an accurate value. Sound is indeed different, not only louder but clearer. I have discovered a couple of things that I didn't know that were in my music. Considering the price, it's worth giving it a try.
B00009NQQO|5.0|This is a good toy.  My son loves to pick up the basketballs and dunk them.  He also likes to fill them up with water and squirt them.  I know the age says 3 years or older, but my son is 14months old and he has had this toy for a month and loved it from day 1.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|My title pretty much says it all.  I really enjoyed the first two books, though both of them were slow to get into.  I really recommend reading the third one if you have read the first two.  SPOILER ALERT::: I was really hoping she would get her red coffee pot in the end!!!  I hate the last paragraph...I really thought they'd get married or something proper.  The ending needs to be rewritten lol...but still read it!  great book if you enjoy wolf books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game. Even though the larger ones are meant for tablets, I still try them on my phone. Keep the puzzles coming dev. I may need cortisone shots from the constant motions, but I keep going.

B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app is pretty good. in MONITORS how much time you have done what. just like it says in the description. see if some people would have read the description like most did, some people didn't (*m!ken!ie*) would haven't had to ask &quot;y people y!&quot; and that's my review!<br />by SarahSmile ;D
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Loved having all three of the books together - Great read even without the geographical references for visualization.  I wish I could be more like Lisbeth.
030758836X|1.0|First off, the language in this book is just insane. I am not a prude, and I don't mind the occasional cuss word, but one or two every page is too much. Second, I hated the characters. Nick is a complete jerk. I could not stand how he treated Amy. Amy on the other hand is a doormat. She lets Nick do whatever he wants to her and she just smiles and nods. This was not suspenseful at all, it was just bad. I got about 110 pages in and called it quits. If you think its a thriller you clearly haven't read many thrillers! Save your money!

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I am a Broadcast Media student and a Senior at UCM. I did a solid week-2weeks worth of research before buying the AKG-240's. Perhaps the most salient finding was that this unit is based on an older design and that engineers and students have been using these cans for years. No wonder they work so well! First of all, cost. You wont find a better set of headphones unless your willing to pay over 300.00$. Personally, I wanted a dual purpose set for both in-studio-sessions and listening to my ipod touch and the AKG-240K's did not disappoint me. From low freq-high freq these sound great w/good bass response as well. I recommend purchasing a little mini-amp for that added equalization and bass for those (you know who you are) are \\"serious about music and good sound. I purchased the little Fiio E6 Headphone Amp w/the L9 shape out dock for ipod and the lil amp is simple to operate and really boosts the sound. I love listening to Dream Theater, Rush, or Led Zepplin with the added volume. Additionally, the Fiio E6 helps me manually adjust the sound with the amp-unit so I dont have to touch or look at my ipod screen, making it easier to operate. I'm glad I popped the extra 30 bucks at the same time I purchased the headphones on Amazon. Sadly, in my research, I found that the K240's are no longer \\"made in Austria.\\" I couldn't find a pair made in Austria at any warehouse in the US. (not sayin' it can't be done but a checked numerous companies/sources) The company is now \\"AKG Acoustics\\" (made in China) But I find the ear-pads soft/comfortable and I'm wearing them 3-4 hours at a stretch at the radio station that I work at. I LOVE the fact that the cord is detachable from the headset. If the cord ever goes bad or gets damaged, you just buy a new cord. Great feature. It comes with an extra long cord and an 1/4 inch TRS (Tip-Ring-Sleeve) gold adapter. The self-adjusting headset has worked well for me and my head is a normal size for a man. Great value and I get lot's of compliments. An old cousin of mine put them on and was blown away. They also look very pro-like and hang up well when not in use. The product comes with a 2 year warranty delivered in a nice gold box. (not real gold/lol) I'm glad I picked the K240's. UPDATED: Jan 2013; My headphones began crackling after 7 months but I believe it was the cheap plastic chinese cord. They were still under warranty (2 years I believe) and I contacted the company and Harmon in Fortuna,CA fixed them in a couple weeks. I'm pretty sure it was the cord because the unit came back with a more flexible./higher quality cord (I know because I deal w/audio everyday) No further issues and they sound great. I just had to pop the five bucks to ship them to CA.An old cousin of mine put them on and was blown away. They also look very pro-like and hang up well when not in use.

B003L77GG0|3.0|Without including spoilers, I would like to say that this was a great series in the Superman mythology.  I really appreciated the time taken to research the history of the story and come  up with compelling, updated story lines. This season, the writing staff seemed to know where they wanted to go, a wedding between Clark and Lois. As a viewer, this was pathetic.  It had been done before at least 3 times in the series and this particular wedding was the most boring of them all.  The final episode was VERY self-indulgent through a boring montage of past episodes and didn't address some of the most interesting plot-lines. What happened to LANA?!?!<br />This box set is actually pretty good, however.  The season in entirety is very well done.<br />I'm not sad I watched it because I have enjoyed the series so much.  I'm just left with a disappointed taste in my mouth from the conclusion episode.

0345803485|3.0|Maybe people reading this book aren't old enough to remember the movie 9 1/2 weeks but there are many similarities. I'm wondering if E L James saw that movie. You have to work to see that CG is a damaged soul and then you start to feel compassion, sympathy, and yes, love for him. But first you have to get through the constant bombardment of nonstop, around every corner sexual escapades. Don't get me wrong, I LIKE sexual escapades. Just not on every page. Would have liked to see much more of the inner workings of CG.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|The reason I bought this Micro USB cable was to replace my cable that was literally disintegrating.  The white plastic covering was peeling off, exposing the wires within.

An excellent adaptation of the original Tin Tin with some superb animation -- the characters, while stylized, are still extremely expressive and entertaining, and the story is a hoot.

B000BQ7BX2|5.0|This EMI collection is an excellent choice for anyone wishing to listen to Mahler's symphonies.  The Cologne Radio Symphony orchestra is quite good, and Gary Bertini's conducting is excellent.  The music was recorded in the mid 80s and early 90s, and the sound quality is fine, particularly in the late symphonies.  I have no reservations at all about recommending this collection.
B007XNAQPG|5.0|Excellent.  Good mix of old and new.  Not really a track I wouldn't have used.  Pretty obvious that there are some liberties taken with voice overs/pre-recorded soundtracks.  Simon just can't bust out studio quality on every song anymore.  But short of the almost too perfect sound, it was great.  Best part, my 8 and 10 year old couldn't wait for it either.  They have Rio and Hungry on their Nintendo DS's and require the new album be played in the car (select tracks...AOR is dead).  Can't say I would buy the CD in that it is just a mix of studio sound but seeing the live was great.  Saw Astronaut live but didn't make it to last tour.  Next best....
B000TERDNO|5.0|If you love the 80's and miss the attitude then this is for you.  I love to crank the music and go back in time.  They can copy Billy Idol all they want, but the original is the best.
B004X80QNG|4.0|This app is a good solution for staying organized on the go.  it is better than the stock application.  Syncs fine on my phone-make sure you are syncing to Google though and not the built in calendar.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm a Pinterest addict,  and I have to say I really enjoy the app! Seems to work fine on my Kindle Fire, no problems logging in and everything loaded just fine. Very pleased pinner :)
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I love this show, and this by far was my favorite season.  The final scene of the finale is so powerful, it brought me to tears.  If you want to laugh like you've never laughed before I highly recommend you download The Big Bang Theory.  It is so unique, and so funny! I would definitely order this again.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Being a massive Smashing Pumpkins fan I was a little sad after hearing Zeitgeist for the first time. There were some good songs but way too many bad songs. I thought well that was an average send off for one of the best bands of all time. Fast forard to a few weeks ago when I sat down to listen to Oceania for the first time. I had been greatly impressed by the first single so I had a glimmer of hope. I was more and more excited with each and every track on this album. I kept waiting for a bad song and none came. I was flashing back to the good old days of great Smashing Pumpkins records(I include Adore on my list unlike many people). All in all I felt proud of this record because of how important S.P. was to my generation. I hope that the youths of today end up listening to this album and enjoying it at least half as much as I have enjoyed their music my entire life.<br />Way to go Billy!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is one of my favortie games....I have it on all things electronic.It's easy to play in different modes and cards and background can be changed. It keeps you on your thinking game.Thank you
0345803507|2.0|I am shocked that this book is on the top charts, it repeats itself through out the whole book ( all three! ) I could not bare to read about him \\" Putting his fingers through his hair \\" and  \\" her biting her lip and having an orgasm just by looking at him!!! \\" It is written very simple and yet every housewife is reading it and gets suckered in ( like myself ) to find out what the hype is about?? Its better you read \\"Cosmo \\" . After awhile the Sex Scenes in the book become boring but you most likely will be like myself and buy the book's ( all three ) hoping the story picks up by the third book which just ends and you are upset well I was.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|useful for accurate battery info on the Kindle Fire. this is definetly a must have app for all android devices. especially KF users.

B0085Z3B2Q|1.0|This is the worst movie I have seen. Actually I have not seen the whole movie. Just the first 30 minutes or so. That is how much I hate it. I was watching it with my 3 year old grandson and I turned it off and told my wife to go exchange it for a different movie or throw it in the trash.<br />This is the green movement`s indoctrination garbage. It`s trying to attract young viewers with colors, music and a lame story line by subtle brainwashing tactics of global warming. No wonder they used Dr. Seuss to push this crap. They had no other character they could create. Dr. Seuss was liberal Democrat.<br />The Lorax is a waste of money and time.
B005IQZB14|4.0|From the start this book captures your curiosity. You can't help but start analyzing your own unresolved Demond's and wonder if you yourself could benefit or even survive an adventure like this. Do I have this kind of drive and determination?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book kept me intrigued the whole time.  I do not read a lot but I could not put this trilogy down.  I would recommend to anyone with an open mind to read the series.
1416583432|3.0|If you are interested in dogs, you will find this book interesting, but if you have no interest, the writing itself won't inspire you to read it.  This is not a must-read book for dog lovers (like anything by Patricia Mcconnell or Karen Pryor), but for casual reading, you could do worse.  In other words, I'd borrow it from the library, but not buy it for myself.<br /><br />The thing I find most interesting is the even distribution of reviews from one star to five stars.  I don't know what to make of that!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|After failed attempts to download and use the Kindle app for android, I finally saw success by purchasing the app through amazon for droid.<br />Hours of headache, but the available ebook selection makes it worthwhile.
0425263908|3.0|Not as strong or as fun a love story as I expected. Very descriptive in its intimate details, but didn't hold my interest as well as 50 Shades. I understand there is a sequel coming out in October and I plan to read it to see if the second book is better than the first. Don't plan on giving up on it, though. Guess I'm too spoiled on Grey.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|What is Rovio thinking, taking $2.99 for something that<br />should be free? I would at least let all the levels in danger zone be free.Why would Rovio or Amazon do this.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This product does exactly what it says that it will do.  It adds virtually no weight or bulk to my Kindle Fire.  The simplicity in the way it works is just fine.  I would recommend this to any Kindle Fire owner.  The quality is also quite good and has a nice feel
0783225849|5.0|I find it hard to believe anyone out there, who is a thriller fan, hasn't seen this classic. Alfred Hitchcock is a genius, and if you liked his series, you'll love this movie. Sometimes old movies can be very \\"slow\\", but this one moves along at a good pace and makes you care about the characters. There are lots of bonus features on this particular DVD, and a good deal about Hitch himself. Even if you have seen the movie, this is a good addition to your collection.
B005D4YOQY|5.0|I bought these to replace some Ozark Trails sandals that I've used for 2 years to garden (i.e. shoveling etc).  They have all the great arch support that I expect from Keen (I've bought 2 pairs of their boots just to have an extra set).  They are very sturdy and stylish.  But they become slippery when wet--so my feet slide around in them on hillsides.  Also, despite the waterproof claims, the material takes a long time to dry out.  I would not take them camping as they absorb too much water to dry quickly.<br /><br />Update:  I need these for shoveling.  The soles are so solid.  The upper straps don't breath too well.  I use another pair if the grass is wet.
0451228731|5.0|Great premise and construction of plot. Only minor issue I had with it was pacing.  The author has obviously done his homework regarding a wide range of topics. Material is interesting not only from a fictional standpoint, but as a plausible 'what if' hypothesis.  He depicts human society very candidly and honestly in a purposefully jarring fashion.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow! I started the first book on a Wednesday and by Thursday of the next week I had read all 3 books. Unfortunately, my pesky JOB got in the way of finishing sooner. I couldn't resist my daily dose of Ana & Christian. I was compelled to pick up my Kindle and continue reading every moment I could spare and even some that I really couldn't/shouldn't. Can't wait for more from EL.<br /><br />Hope we are not disappointed with the movie version.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Like so many others I've been longing for Pinterest on my Fire. The app works perfectly, so happy!!! Thanks, Pinterest!!!
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I was browsing the bookstore and this album was playing. I just had to buy it. Emeli Sande has a beautiful voice, lyrics, music. It's both a chill yet intense album all at once.
B004KCPXVK|5.0|Season three of Fringe is a roller coaster.  Fringe is one of the most exciting tv shows that always keeps you wanting more, especially at the end of season three!! Highly recommend this series so excited that is finally streaming somewhere. People can finally see what they have been missing.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I think the books are fantastic. I found myself going to bed at 10:30 and finally turning out the light at 4:30!!
B005KMX866|5.0|If you're a Chris Isaak fan, it's another CD you need to add to your collection. The songs bring back memories from another era in music history.  Chris does a great job putting his personal style on the songs and his band does a super job too.

0143034901|5.0|I haven't been this excited about a book since...well, maybe the Alchemist and that is for a completely different reason.  This book is beautiful, heart-wrenching, moving and a treasure beyond words.  I was transformed to a different place and time and the only downside of this book is that it ended.  I am a fan....
B00005JMXX|1.0|Usually with my expectations lowered, based on the bad reviews on IMDB, I can enjoy movies like this.  Not this time.  The movie has nice disaster special effects, but the story is terrible.  It was so bad that I turned it off after an hour.<br /><br />There is nothing worthwhile to enjoy.  Forget about the poor science, its just a painfully bad movie.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My wife and I read this book several years ago and we were changed forever by the wisdom presented.  In fact as a Pastor I use this as a required tool for couples getting married, in counselling married couples, and with \\"911\\" relationships.  It will revolutionize how you approach the precious relationship you share with another.  In many ways it can be utilized for any relationship, friendships, family, ect...  Of course the intimacy parts do not apply to non-married relationships, however the principles are important to act upon. Maybe because it is very much based on the manual for living...the Bible.[[ASIN:0802473156 The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts]]
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great resource for a Bible on the go. or shall I say several bibles on the go!
055357342X|5.0|I'm hooked on this series of fantasy/adventure stories! I usually read mostly mysteries and\\"literary\\" novels, but the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\"  series was recommended by my daughter, so I gave it a try. There is more than enough mystery at every turn! Adventure, suspense, sex, you name it and this series has it. The fantasy elements are unobtrusive and work perfectly. I am not generally much of a fantasy fan, but this really seems more like historical fiction: knights and maidens, etc. (Don't worry, the maidens are FAR from helpless pawns, many times.) I really think the series compares favorably with the Lord of the Rings-it's that good!<br />This third book of the series does not disappoint. We are constantly updated about each main character's struggles. Some scenes are difficult to take, being full of gore and viciousness, but you can console yourself that it is not real. Good triumphs over evil just often enough to keep you reading, but the personalities of the major players are pretty complex. It is not so easy to decide just who is good and who isn't, at all times. The author is known as one who will kill off a favorite, too, so be prepared.<br />\\"Storm of Swords\\" continues the story of the clash of  various would-be kings, and the fascinating mistress of dragons who is coming from afar to reclaim the throne that is rightfully hers. Men, women, children, eunuchs, wolves and dragons  all play important roles in these books-there is REALLY something for everyone. I will definitely keep reading to the end of the series, if the books continue to be this good!

B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game is absolutely adorable!! I love Hello Kitty and this game is fun. Its somewhat like Diner Dash but a Hello Kitty version. It's nice and I really like it and its free?! C'mon, if you're a Hello Kitty fan I suggest getting this, it's fun and free and I have a good feeling you'll love it like I do! :D
B003ZTQN1I|3.0|Loved the movie, \\"Country Strong\\", and expected the soundtrack to be the music that I heard in the movie.  Some of it is, but they left out the very best duet between Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester, \\"Give In To Me\\", and instead put a version by Faith Hill on this soundtrack.  EXTREMELY disappointing to me.  I really like Faith Hill's music and I own a lot of it.  She's great.  But, this isn't her song, and the people buying this soundtrack are probably like me, and want the version that was in the movie.  There were a couple of more good songs, one by Garrett Hedlund and one by Leighton Meester, but both were left off of the soundtrack, and \\"filler songs\\" added by artists that had nothing to do with the movie.  Leighton Meester did a great job on the song that was a hit for Sara Evans, but Sara's version is on the CD.  That should not be; Sara was not in the movie.  The producers of this soundtrack should have stuck with all of the original music from the movie, and it would have been a great CD.  I like it and I listen to it, but I am still disappointed every time I hear Faith Hill sing, \\"Give In To Me\\".<br />I didn't get the check box that lets readers of this review know that I purchased this CD @Amazon, but I did!
0307277887|1.0|I absolutely love the show Dexter, all six seasons, and I'm eagerly awaiting the seventh. The wait is unbearable so I thought I'd purchase the Dexter books and see what they are like. I read reviews and already knew to not get too excited, that I'd most likely be disappointed. Reading these books has not been a thrill.<br /><br />They are extremely boring. The characters are horrible! Dexter is dull and repetitive. LaGuerta is apparently a serpent because she is constantly flicking her tongue out, and Deb must be a lion or tiger because all she does is SNARL. Literally! Every interaction Dexter has with Deb in the first book alone involves Deb snarling at him and being unpleasant. And every time Angel is mentioned he is referred to as Angel-no relation because apparently that's how he always introduces himself... All drivers in Florida are homicidal maniacs that cut people off and flip the bird. Rita is... she can't... um... is always dropping her sentences which gets seriously irritating. Cody and Astor are... unbelievable.<br /><br />Frankly, I would recommend not wasting your time or money on these books as they are, in my opinion, not enjoyable.
0545265355|5.0|After all the hype, I broke down and succumbed to reading this trilogy. I expected either a fairy-tale with and a \\"happy-ever-after\\" ending, or an Orwellian rip-off. Once I started reading, I was hooked. I was treated to an original, well thought out, well-written, thought-provoking social commentary. Although history will be the real test, I believe Heinlein, Huxley, and Orwell better make room at the top of classic sci-fi for Suzanne Collins.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Look forward to reading his other books.<br />Learned a lot about Tony and the realities of the restaurant business.
B007N85POS|5.0|I especially like the one scene where the dog comes out of the bush and eats the beach balls.  The other scenes I like have a giant white bird you have to hit and one is a plane load of birds you have to hit.  Only game this soon to be 55 yr married broad plays non stop!
0345529057|5.0|Great books.  If you love the show you will love the books more.  Great writer can't wait for the next season of the show.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I started playing Angry Birds last Nov and now I have 4 versions of it on my Kindle Fire.  It's the only game of it's kind I play and it's a great way to pass the time.  I even got my friends started and we're all 2nd stage baby boomers!  LOL

B00466HM28|1.0|Works as advertised but the keys are stiff. Pads take too much presure to activate. Nice that I dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop.<br /><br />After the first few uses the USB socket broke and fell off into the unit rendering it useless. Wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru Amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed. I had registered it with AKAI already so I complained to them and they sent me a new one. I had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product.<br /><br />Not recommending this product.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie was amazing. made me cry! it will be so amazing if they had a sequel so that we can see what happens to all of the characters!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love evernote.  I have created so many notes and check lists with this app.  It definitely helps me get organized.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|This is total old school, hard as nails thrash.  There is not one weak song on the disc, but my favorites are Rise Up, True American Hate, and Native Blood.  I love that the old school thrash bands (Testament, Overkill, Exodus, Megadeth) are still flying the flag for thrash and doing it better and heavier than any new bands can do it.  Great album, highly recommended.
B008FOB124|5.0|This is the kind of haunting music I could listen to forever. Every song on the list is better than the last. What a breathtaking comeback album! I can only hope their muse continues to inspire them for many years to come.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is an amazing app I love it. but on the kindle when it is fully charged it only it only shows 99%. and I have one recommendation that would be to add some different voices for the alerts.

B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Angry birds is a simplistic way to pass time when bored.  Nothing on TV, don't feel like reading but just want something to do to keep me occupied.  Angry birds does it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this app is awsome my son and daughter and myself love it. i bring it every where with us really a great app
B008220B0C|4.0|I went to see this with my daughter  and my sister because although I am not a \\"die hard\\" Katy Kat, I do appreciate what a great and powerful influence she is on girls today and Im not gonna lie, I really like her music. Its one of the few times you dont have to take everything so seriously and just be SILLY!<br /><br />That being said, this movie made me cry, laugh, sing and feel what Ms Perry felt in her heartbreaks. She shows what acceptance and determination really can accomplish in a very open and honest way.<br /><br />I left that movie not only with a whole new respect for her as an artist and role model but it made me proud to be a woman/mother showing my daughter that it really does pay off to be yourself no matter WHAT ANYONE TELLS YOU!!<br /><br />two thumbs WAY up!
1741048303|5.0|Loyal to Lonely Planet's tradition, this is a very comprehensive, easy to use guide on the whole of this multifaceted nation.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|Romantic fiction with enough suspense to keep you reading.  Loved it and the ending was a surprise, a good read.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The book is easily read, and the author has the ability to draw pictures with words which allow the reader to easily imagine the scene. The story, while fictional and sci fi remains credible, allowing the reader to draw similarities between that world and this, the characters are people who have feelings and experiences we have. An easy to read and follow story.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is my first Nicholas Sparks novel. Katie, a secretive young woman comes to a small seaside town in North Carolina and finds a job at a local restaurant. She becomes involved with the owner of the general store, a widower with two children. Gradually she opens up and we learn she is running from an abusive marriage. The husband finally tracks Katie down giving us a decent enough element of suspense. A slight downside for me was the supernatural element as I didn't think this was necessary to the plot or overall tone of the book.<br /><br />I liked this book enough to seek out more by this author.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Just got around to installing and testing, and it keeps telling me it cannot connect to the server, to check my settings.

B004SIIBGU|4.0|The only reason not receiving 5 stars is that it does not have all of the functionality that the actual website has.  But in these cases, you can always use the Kindle to connect to the internet & browse to the site.  Otherwise, it works as expected & is nice to have a quick shortcut to keep up on my watched & selling items.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|I have listened to this album over and over and it's almost like listening to something new each time. I shouldn't say \\"new\\" really. It goes back to the roots of rock, blues and even a bit of country to mesh together what real music used to be like. From beginning to end, this is one of the best new bands to produce such an amazing debut album in years (in my opinion). For those searching for a bit of old school, classic rock and blues sound, look no further. I cannot wait to see Alabama Shakes on tour this year!
B0063IH60K|4.0|good functioning. ads are easy to skip. typical solitaire games though don't like supposed records for 1 minute where Pol obviously just clicked through as fast as possible

0385342063|5.0|Poppy Wyatt is in a bit of a pickle.  Her friends had been trying on her family heirloom engagement ring when the fire alarm sounded.  When they were finally allowed to re-enter the hotel, the ring was missing.  To top off her bad day, her phone is stolen right out of her hand.  In a bit of luck, she finds a different phone in the garbage and declares it her own.  In typical Sophie Kinsella fashion, hilarity ensues as Poppy not only tries to hide that she's lost the ring (she bandages her \\"burned\\" hand) but deals with the man whose assistant abruptly quit and tossed the phone that Poppy found.<br /><br />Poppy is the perfect heroine:  flawed, but trying; wonderful, but insecure.  She holds nothing back in her narration, even filling in more of the story through the use of footnotes (which she uses because she was impressed by them in her fiancé's book).  Poppy cracked me up repeatedly as she tried to sort out her own mess while also attempting to help the man who had been just a stranger on the phone before he became so much more.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I like erotica but this is fairly unimaginative and poorly written to me it was a bdsm version of Mills and Boon. Not worthy of being number one.
0060245867|1.0|I hate to be a party poop, but I do believe there is a very evil subliminal message in this book.<br /><br />The point seems to be that it is bad to do kindness for people, since they invariably will end up taking advantage of you.<br /><br />Not surprising the author is not Christian.<br /><br />This book is very anti-Christian and anti-Biblical.<br /><br />Compare this with the parable of the Good Samaritan.<br /><br />BEWARE THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES!
0763644765|5.0|My 20 month-old son's interest in the potty waxes and wanes, but boy does he love the 'Polly book!\\" He loves everything about this and so do I - illustrations and design are gorgeous and clear, and the story is great and leaves room for flexibility (and teaches NOT to imitate how the doggie pees).
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this version of solitaire. It's.easy mindless and User friendly. The only drawback is the accompanying advertising. I can usually opt out of most of them after a few seconds,  but some hold you captive until finished -very annoying. Otherwise. It's a great free app.
B004A8ZWWO|4.0|Ben Stiller and a wonderful group of actors created a really funny comedy about the staff that works in the Manhattan highrise building managing every whim of its residents.  They are in the service business and catering to their rich clientele's needs is their job.  One of its residents has a financial money manager and he is asked to manage staff's retirement funds.  All is good until one day, building's office manager (played by Ben Stiller) finds out that FBI is after this money manager and they acuse him of fraud.  Pensions are good and jobs are lost; but this determined group of people is looking to find a way to get it all back.<br /><br />They assemble a team that is responsible for robbing the money manager of the funds they suspect he is hiding in his penhouse.  All they want is their retirement funds back.  It is cute movie, because we learn that every person, from a man who holds the door open, to cleaning staff of the building and concierge they all use the skills they have to accomplish the task on hand.  It is sensitive and smart look at the fact that every person has purpose and they all provide value to the world, no matter how small.  Story is well thought out and I personally liked the ending, but I understand that movie had three alternate endings.  So which one you will end up seeing, I really am not sure.<br /><br />It is a great entertainment movie and can be seen by all generations.  It is funny and smart.

B000L53D4O|1.0|This toy is NOT sturdy at all.  If my child puts any weight on it while pulling up it flips.  He has been pulling up and cruising around, even standing unaided a bit for a while.  When he uses this it either tips and smacks into him... or starts rolling ahead of him to fast.  If I wasn't always right there when we have it out he would probably fall on his face.  The activities aren't that fabulous either.  When he was a young baby I had it flat so he could play with it.  He liked flipping the little flaps back and forth for a few minutes a few different occasions and that was about it.  Overall, a waste of money.  If I was going to buy an unsturdy activity walker again I would get the vtech one, at least the activities are entertaining.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|When I was home ill a short while ago, my good friend, Jane, stopped over to visit.  We started talking about great books, those that mix fact with fiction. Stephen King's latest, 11/22/63 is just that book.  With a time-travel and you-can-change-history plot, I decided it was worth the investment and the 849 pages.<br /><br />Title character, Jake Epping, is a high school English teacher in present-day small town in Maine.  He is recently divorced and lives by himself but for his self-reliant cat. In addition to his daytime duties he also teaches night classes and frequently stops by the local diner for a quick meal and to chat with the owner, Al Templeton.  One night, Templeton shows Epping a secret portal to the past, specifically, September 9, 1958.  Al has discovered that time moves in real-time in the past, but upon returning to the future, realizes that time has moved forward only 2 minutes. More importantly, repeat trips back to the past reset any changes that were made in the previous visit.  But Al's health is failing and he can no longer travel back in time.  Now it's Jake's turn to change events that impact the future, in particular, to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963.<br /><br />This book was not just good, it was by far the most engrossing tale of fact mixed with fiction that I have ever read, so engaging that I read straight through only stopping to catch 5 hours sleep and spend 3 hours running errands.  King's descriptions of life in the late 1950s brought back vivid memories of my own life in that era.  I could easily picture his characters and fiction soon became transparent with fact.<br /><br />As I continued to read I couldn't help but try to predict how the main character would stop the tragic actions of November 22nd, and how that would cause ripple effects and impact the future (our present).  I would create my own scenarios as Jake would make a few repeat trips back to the past and return to the present.  Attimes the book read like the movie \\"Groundhog Day\\" but with more serious and logical undertones.  Although King never explained the origin of the portal or the significance of September 9, 1958, it became irrelevant as the events unfolded and Jake learned from his past attempts.<br /><br />This is a five star book, one to read then ponder the possibilities, if, or even when, time travel becomes a possibility.  Maybe the clues are already around us?

B0022W6L6G|5.0|Ah, how good music soothes the soul. This collection of FM's greatest hits takes me back to when singers were also musicians. This is one of their best compilations, short, but very sweet.

B007KZY1YY|2.0|The first book was ok, but this one just rehashes all the same things and doesn't go anywhere. There is no story line and it was a waste of time.
B004I744AS|5.0|It seems like it has every word ever created. I'd encourage anyone who has an android device to use this dictionary.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think its fun to pass time traveling to work. they can do wolithout all he ads but other than that I haven't had any other issues
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Still a solid book and I finished it in 3 days.  It is definitely a new angle to tie in Star Trek and make fun of the show in a good way.
0439023513|1.0|Like many of the other 1 star reviewers I LOVED the first 2 books.<br /><br />I thought this last book was too depressing with the endless war, torture, mission, pods, drugged mental states, etc...<br /><br />So she put on the Mockingjay suit, there were very few times she was the actual Mockingjay and not just a puppet or pawn.  I did NOT feel she became the Mockingjay and acknowledged her real power she just wore the suit.  She was just a shell, always hiding, drugged, crying, and just plain unlikable.<br /><br />The story also made me dislike and disconnect from most all of the characters at every turn. Every single one. Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch, Plutarch.  We never really got a good feel for her family that were supposed to mean so much to her.  Her mother is too full of grief to be with her at the end?  When you lose 2 people you love wouldn't that bring you closer to your only living family member?<br /><br />Then a host of new characters are introduced just to be offed before any real connection can be formed.  It leads to boredom and frustration for me.<br /><br />I agree with others, the only one she makes more likeable is Finnick but unfortunately he dies so quickly in a random paragraph without any emotion attached to it.  No real emotion from Katniss.  We do not know how this affects Annie yet at the very end there is mention of a baby.<br /><br />There was just entirely too much detail on the war and not enough on the people in the book.  I didn't connect with the characters and found my self just trying to get thru it to get it over with.<br /><br />Then at the end we are supposed to believe she marries and has children, why?  That was not what she ever wanted and at every page of the book leading up to this we are essentially reminded that she is mental, numb, damaged, and basically dead inside.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm pretty sure everyone who is interested has already read this book.  You should read it before the movie comes out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The first book was absolutely amazing, I wasn't able to put it down.  Infact I have been up every night until 1:30am since getting the first book on my kindle.  Such a page turner, it has been a long time since I have felt that way about a book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was one of the surprise books for me when I read it.  Most of the time when you have a female heroin she ends up just making friends on her adventure that do everything for her.  Think Wizard of Oz.  This was a nice change from that and excellently written.
B001UFQNF0|5.0|My son became very interested in the Back to the Future series so bought this for him for Christmas. It arrived on time and the toy is simply amazing, partly because I love Back to the Future as well. The design is very detailed and the sounds are great. My son has since moved on to other toys and I'm tempted to take this to my office for display but afraid someone will remove it from my office. Excellent buy and a great conversation piece for those who love the 80's.
B005LAII08|1.0|I can't decide if Brave is worse than Cars 2. Its a close call. This movie's plot is immature and pointless. 20 minutes into this film I wanted to leave which is a seldom occurrence. I can usually \\"get into\\" just about any film no matter how bad, but this is just horrible writing. Did they buy the script from ebay? All the other Pixar films had good plots and I can't help but compare today's films with the old school one's from the 80's like Labyrinth, The Secret of Nymph, and The Dark Crystal. At one time Pixar prided itself on plot development that took a year or more alone. Clearly those days are gone. I saw they are making Monsters 2 and I cringe at how bad they might screw up that potential franchise.
B002AS463W|3.0|I remember the first time I saw `9 ½ Weeks'.  I was like fourteen and I was watching it for one very obvious reason.  It didn't really do much for me.  It reminded me of `Basic Instinct' in a way, a film I also so at a tender teen age for the very same reason.  It was just lukewarm for me and at the time (and even today) didn't really introduce me to anything I was overly excited to see.  I was letdown, in that department.  Watching `9 ½ Weeks' in my later years and obviously watching it for different reasons, one is able to differentiate between those teen observations and one of a more mature moviegoer.  That isn't to say that `9 ½ Weeks' is a very good movie or that it actually says a lot of what it attempts to say about relationships and the dangers therein, but I do gather more from this than that awkward moment where food became perverted and I became disinterested.  Other films that have been likened to `9 ½ Weeks' like `Secretary' or `Last Tango in Paris' are far more observant of their themes and develop them in a more substantial way, but credit should be given to Adrian Lyne for trying to add some depth to her spice.  Sadly, for me, this isn't deep enough and isn't spicy enough to warrant my undivided attention.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|In Trinidad they use the term \\"chupid\\" (I.e. stupid).  No substance, but if you want a fantasy book - this is for you.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|I am a big fan of sci-fi movies, but had been putting off seeing this movie because of all the mixed reviews. Watched it last night and I was extremely surprised at how good this movie is.  It's so refreshing to see an original idea and I really can't compare it to any other movie, which is a good thing.  It's sad that it's received so much criticism, although everyone is entitled to their opinion.  Yes, there are some things that don't make sense, such as how the aliens & humans can understand each other(although they've been stuck on Earth for quite some time so it makes sense to me that eventually they'd be able to communicate), but honestly, WHO REALLY CARES?!  The CG in this movie is pretty amazing in my opinion (some parts do look kind of cheesy though).  Yes, it's violent, but honestly, Saving Private Ryan was WAY more violent and everyone praised that movie, so if people complain that it's violent that doesn't really make sense to me.  I mean, who doesn't love a ray gun that blows people up?!  And I'm a chic.  I think the combination of action, comedy and horror really works in this movie.  Plot development kept me on my toes.  I enjoyed not knowing exactly what was about to happen as some of the characters are hard to read and act spontaneously.  Yes, it's filled with allegory, but I don't think they shove it in everyone's face as much as some of the negative reviews say.  I think people just don't want to agree that humans can be real jerks and they tend to turn a blind eye.  Maybe it SHOULD be shoved in their faces.  This is definitely a movie you're either going to love or hate.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love it but it takes a lot of time to make credits I spent 3 hours getting enough money to make the theater. come on on but otherwise addicting could be better keep it up though
B003L77G06|5.0|Finally ABC comes out with something that isn't pure Disney family value crap. Ed O'niel owns this role and is surrounded by a very talented cast. Watch this.
B008OOYALE|4.0|It's well put together and definitely made to be a Kindle version of Dragonvale. Unfortunately,  it is no Dragonvale. The first reason is because it's extremelly exspensive for in game purchases,  and the dragons don't sell for half of what they cost in the store. Also,  starting out with 20 bricks was good,  but 30 would be more helpful to speed things up. Finally,  everything takes too long. Too bbreed even starting dragons takes over two hours!
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Great value for great songs
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Flowers for Algernon was an excellent read. My son read it in school this past year and he recommended it to me as he loved it. I was glad he did. It was very interesting how the author portrayed how many in our society view mentally challenged individuals, and how many view and define happiness. This is one of those books that really makes you think.....
0307744434|5.0|I did not expect that you could do so much with black and white. At the outset it seemed like such a limited circus, but the author turned that into an exploration of the space.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is what you will want to play at the airport, Dr. Office anywhere that will be appropriate to kill time.
0345409671|4.0|So, after Lestat, the Brat Prince of Vampires, the James Bond of the Nosferatu, our defiant Lestat, has awakened the progenitor of the Vampire race and seen her apocalyptic vision, after he's learned what it is to inhabit the body of a mortal man, after he is again beautiful, enigmatic and anonymous (as in, not a world famous rock star), when he is again among the few remaining Vampires of the world...Lestat encounters The Devil. Please don't call him Beelzebub or Lucifer. Memnoch will do. And here Anne Rice embarks on something that would look like hubris if we didn't know that she went ahead and wrote novels about Christ essentially from Christ's point of view. Lestat, almost like Daniel Webster, is put in a position to judge the justice of Memnoch's case against the Almighty. He visits Christ during the Temptation, he meets G-d the Father and he sees Hell (or does he?). This novel is a question mark and it is through this evasion of certainty that Anne Rice negates the hubris for which she might otherwise be accused. We aren't certain, really, to what extent we can be credulous of the Devil (he is supposed to be the Father of Lies, whatever Claudia had to say on the subject). A lot of readers were uncomfortable with the ambiguity, but I found so many images in this novel haunting, beautiful and worth considering. On my first visit to St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, having read this novel, I could not stop picturing the tableaux Anne Rice painted there. I don't know if it's destined to be one of the great works of literary worth or theological depth, but it is a beautiful and artistic novel meant to make you question everything. After all, that's exactly what the Devil wants, isn't it?
B007TVANDM|5.0|Very fun read and my 3 year old loves to read it with us. Such a good moral. Great when my daughter gets upset because she doesn't get her way or an accident happens we can say would Pete cry, goodness no!  Fabulous!

B008XFB86Y|4.0|A fantastic theme of brutal streetfighting coupled with mixed martial arts is the driving force, unfortunately it lacks a punch plotwise. I found myself screaming at the tv for a victor while enraptured in the insane action. If you can stomach idiotic police characters who actually disgrace the name of justice and so must be redeemed by a handful of honest ones while men die left and right, this movie is for you.
B003K16P3M|4.0|So I enjoyed this book a lot - strong female lead who isn't interested in the typical HEA (marriage and babies) which I found refreshing. She doesn't need a man to define who she is. As much as I enjoyed the book, I was disappointed in the ending which didn't feel like an ending at all - it feels like there is so much more to the story of these two main characters that should be told. I can understand that the author may want to pursue the story of other characters but I wish she would have done it as offshoots of the main series or as a separate series (like Briggs' Mercy Thompson series and her Alpha and Omega series) rather than skip from character to character in the same series. I also agree that given the sexual content of the book it would be more appropriate for the 16 and up crowd (or maybe for really mature 15 year-olds) but 14 seems a bit too young to me. If you are looking for a series with action and less romance I would recommend Roth's Divergent series, Susan Ee's Angelfall series, Blackwell's Destiny Binds series, Buroker's Emperor's Edge series, or Battista's Moon series (though still slightly on the mature side).
0802473156|1.0|As others have said, the message of this book could have been delivered in about two pages max.  Granted, the premise is interesting, and I got some insights from examining how the 5 Love Languages play out in my own life. However, I did that BEFORE I read the book, based on a short review of it.<br /><br />The book itself is awful.  It is superficial, anecdotal, opinionated, self-promoting drivel.  It wasn't even worth the trip to the library, much less buying.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought the book was great, much better than the second. It kept me wanting to read more and although the ending was wonderful, I was sad to finish the book.
B005RUS78K|5.0|Just love this show and am looking forward to getting the next set. I think it is well done and worth the money to get it.

B00472NZDQ|3.0|a very nice book again by Michael COnnelly, a book while readin brings you to a climax, but the climax is a little bit disappointing, according to me. The subject is ok, the writing is compelling and interesting enough but the plot could and should be better for an author like him.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|super fun! games are silly and challenging. quick enough to keep me interested. :-) easy enough for my 5 year old to play
030758836X|3.0|Found it hard to identify with either of the main characters and thought the story was not real believeble.  Hated the ending

B0054JZC6E|5.0|If you like hard easy fun games you will like this because there are lots of all of those games. Well worth downloading......

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I bought this case in order to be able to safely carry my Kindle in my bag without having to worry for any scratches or any damage that the device could suffer since I'm away from home must of the time and I'm always moving around. The color is beautiful (I bought the pink one) and the standing positioning works great. I read in other reviews that people were saying that they tried to set the case on standing position and that it would fold backwards, I've had the case for around a month or so and have had no issues at all. Also, it's VERY lightweight, but it's just perfect and simply matches the description of the product. STRONGLY recommend!!!! :D

0321647440|1.0|The book appears to be well put together well and I'd recaddsome decent reviews however the lesson files on the DVD do not match and this is insanely frustrating and makes the book worthless because the lessons are cumulative.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|love this app.  challenging yet very relaxing at the same time.  great to quiet your mind before bed.  soothing music as well.  hints do come in handy as some levels are quite puzzling.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this book. I wanted it but didn't want to spend this much money on a book, But I am so glad I did. I even got my sister the first book for her birthday, And she loved it. It is well worth the money to get it.When you get it go on and get all of them at one time, or you will be back to get the others in a day or two. I couldn't put it down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|After initial download there was the issue with logging in with Facebook but Pinterest support is very helpful. I had to go to the full site and switch Facebook linking to ON. There are its few hiccups but this is to be expected with it being the first version and the amount of people using. I am so addicted and will continue to report issues to pinterest as they seem to be quick to help. Although besides the initial login issue its worked perfect for me!
B00407PNY2|5.0|Great service and arrived early. Great old movie AND movie of the week.\\"  I will use this eller again!!!! This is the movie with worlds first and GREATest car chase scence. See Jakie Bisset that young was worth it. \\"Give it a try.
B000YDCFRE|4.0|They run large has to return the first pair for a size smaller and even then they are more comfortable with a thicker hiking sock. Otherwise I have no complaints, nice looking boot with jeans or will dress up as well
B008FTAAG2|3.0|For those who have been following ITM since Beautiful Tragedy you are used to change.  They have released four full length albums and all four are different.  They may have gone a bit too far for some on this one. I'm into quite a bit of industrial music as well as metal, so the electronic stuff didn't bother me but if you are a fan of the heavier, faster ITM songs or don't care for the first single 'Blood' or the dub-step influences you may wanna give this a pass because that's pretty much what the rest of the album is like.  As far as the rest the production is excellent, the song writing is good and there aren't any songs on the album I dislike.  Its just that the tempo is incredibly flat.  Nothing super-mellow (except maybe 11:11) and nothing super-heavy.<br />  That being said, 'Burn' is probably my favorite track here.  'Whore', Blood' and 'Adrenalize' are all good as well.  As a long-time fan of the band I am hoping that this isn't just a blatant attempt by them for a bit of commercial success because if it is I'm afraid they will lose as many fans as they gain.  They seem to be favoring the new material in their live shows as well.  I was at the Dayton, Oh show and besides their headlining set being incredibly short (8 or 9 songs) only 3 were from their first three albums.  I get the idea of promoting new material but it would have been nice to throw the long-time fans a bone too.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Nothing to complain about this product. Can provide high performance and easily oc to around 5G.<br /><br />Don't really need a liquid cooler. Try a $30 fan, you'll be fine.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A spell binding book with many twists and turns and leaving one with the feeling that the protagonists deserve each other!
B004EPZ07U|4.0|Maybe it's just that Green Lantern isn't well-known enough to mainstream America to have been a hit. But then not many people knew who Iron Man was, either.<br /><br />Whatever the case, this is a great movie, it just didn't find its audience unfortunately. Not everything about it works. The computer-painted-on costume just looked weird, and as much as I like Ryan Reynolds, I don't think he was suitable for this part. His pretty boy smartass charm works in his other films, but as a longtime GL fan, I pictured this role going to a more ruggedly handsome actor who can play it straight, like John Hamm.<br /><br />The story also suffers from the common error of trying to fit too many villians into the story. You get Hector Hammond, Sinestro (not a villian yet, but that's set up at the end for the probably-not-forthcoming sequel), and Parallax. It's all too much. This is the kind of stuff that wrecked \\"Spider-Man 3\\", and it dilutes this movie as well.<br /><br />The film is gorgeously shot if you're a fan of CGI animation, though I wouldn't fault anyone for finding it all too overwhelming. It should definitely have been a bigger hit than it was, and I hope they continue the franchise. They just need to wipe the slate clean and start over like they did with that OTHER green superhero.

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I really enjoy playing the game. It is nice that it allows you to skip the dialogue.  My only problem is with the constant prompting for a review and to sign into facebook.  Hopefully writing this will stop one of the nags.  It really bothers me wnern it asks for a review before you hasve even had a chance to try the game.  I like to give honest reviews after I have really tried it out.  Also, sometimes it prompts you to log into facbook two times in a row.  Get rid of the nags and you get the star back.  The game is fun.  Only once or twice has it registered a click when I didn't want it to.

B00005JGAB|1.0|Good evening ladies and gents!  I love punk rawk to the fullest... my favorites include Avril Lavigne, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, New Found Glory, Blink 182, and NOFX... but lately I've noticed a huge following of the so called \\"70s punk movement\\"... get lost people! Punk began in 1999 when Carson Daly played \\"what's my age again\\" on TRL. Before that..... punk was in an underground form defined by the GODS, Green Day and Offspring.<br /><br />Now on to this Ramones band... what's the hype people? They sound like another garbage pop punk band...how are they in any way important to the history of music? The guitarists can't write a catchy riff to save his life... and the lyrics sound like something a Sesame Street kid would have written!  This Ramones band will never make it big on MTV with their nasty long hair and leather jackets... peace out folks!<br /><br />For historic punk rawk albums check out \\"Dookie\\" by Green Day and \\"Smash\\" by Offspring... before that Punk was non-existant!

0765350386|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was recommended to me by a coworker who saw me re-reading Geroge R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" in anticipation of a new HBO season.  He thought I'd like it and he made a great call.  The book is a departure from most fantasy series because it does not have any people who can do \\"magic\\" in the sense of twirling wands or reciting incantations.  Instead, the ingenious Brandon Sanderson has created something totally new: a system he calls \\"Allomancy\\" in which gifted people can use metal to give themselves special abilities.  He has also created a world led by an immortal tyrant whom a ragtag group of people are attempting to bring down.  He peppers the story with so many fantastic things, like the truly frightening creatures he calls \\"Steel Inquisitors\\" and hints at the backstory behind the immortal tyrant's rise to power.  And his core group of thieves (some gifted with Allomantic powers, most not) are very three dimensional and quite relatable -- even funny, at times.  It's like \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" meets steampunk dungeons and dragons.  He is a gifted world builder, and creates a perfect balance between explaining enough about his world to keep you hooked on the story, while leaving many things mysterious or deliberately unexplained, so that reading the next book is no longer optional.<br /><br />My only minor complaints are kind of trivial.  I took issue with the headings he uses at the beginning of each chapter.  They are diary entries, and we don't find out until halfway through the book where they came from, but even when that is \\"explained\\" the entries themselves are simply not as engaging or well written as the rest of the book.  The sections he chose to use seem almost random.  It would have been more interesting if these pieces had been put together into larger chunks for the characters to read along with the reader, and if they were better written in general.  I also don't get why he writes \\"End of part one\\" etc. at the end of each section.  We can tell it's ending dude; the next section is right there labeled on the adjoining page.<br /><br />Not so minor: I also could have done without the love story he manufactured between the main character and a young nobleman.  Of course, the nobleman isn't \\"typical\\" and of course they're practically drooling over each other at first sight.  A better build-up into that relationship would have made the things that happened as a result of it later in the book easier to swallow.  But aside from that, he steers very clear of typical fantasy plot cliches, and the story is brutal and realistic.  It's something I can easily see myself reading again and again, if only to understand the battle scenes.  He is careful to explain how Allomancy works and very descriptive about how the characters are achieving their amazing feats of derring-do, but my eyes glazed a bit on these sections because I wanted to carry on with the plot.  However, upon re-reading the book, I'll definitely slow it down and try to visualize exactly what's happening, move by move, in the action sequences.  I appreciate having them there, is what I'm saying, even if I didn't read them carefully the first time around.<br /><br />The book was so gripping that I spent perfectly sunny vacation days reading it instead of exploring my vacation destination, which was a city I'd never been to in a country I'd never visited before.  Now THAT is good writing.  This first one was a gift but when I got back from vacay, I made a special trip to the store to obtain the next two and have already started the second book.  I am really thrilled to have found a series worthy of sinking my teeth into that doesn't pale in comparison to George R.R. Martin's.  Here's hoping that all the good things I've heard about the final two acts of this trilogy prove to be true!nd of each section.

B007BZM3HK|5.0|Great summer song and the price was right! Played it quite a bit at the beach. Great memories for 2012.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Its pretty cool on how you can choose your background and card color. The one bad thing about it is the adds are annoying!
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I got this dvd for my 12 year old daughter and she thinks it's the Cat's Pyjamas.  (If anyone who is reading this is under 40, 'cat's pyjamas' is a good thing)  I looked at the video with her and saw a lot of cute boys jumping around and singing and looking great in their fashionable duds from a myriad of expensive designers, no doubt.  If that is what you want in a 1D video, then this is what you want to buy.  Moms and dads, it's harmless fun...no swearing, nothing R-rated but of course a bit of the British swagger going on onstage.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Loved it.  Some good chick lit, plus a bit of drama and throw in some seriously raunchy scenes... all in all a thoroughly enjoyable read!
B000XCZGVI|1.0|The Zodiac (two disk Director's cut) HD DVD will not play on regular DVD or Blu Ray players.  There should be a Caution on the listing but there is not.  OOPS,<br />I guess someone noticed and now there is an \\"ALERT\\".  It's a hard way to learn that HD means that it takes a specific HD player.  Granted Amazon does take it back but they charge the shipping and you have to pay the shipping back---so that's not a good deal.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Very interesting story.  I have never been a real big book reader, in fact I can't remember the last book I read before this one.  My wife got me a kindle for our anniversary and the hunger games was the book she suggested.  I was very satisfied and couldn't put the book down.
B0086700CM|5.0|i cant stop playing this game, I love it. ok, one last game, ok, one last game. this game is so addictive
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Great product. Love to be able to run without cords.... Does use up the battery a little faster but well worth it. It was also easy to connect the bluetooth earphones. Had no problems.
034580404X|5.0|I received the books on a Friday evening and had all three read by the following Sunday (9 days).  The books intrigued me and I couldn't put them down.  I can't wait for the next one!!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|i love the game u should play it its so fun but then it is hard some times well this is wolftail from last hopr bye
B005EWDAFQ|3.0|Perhaps my expectations were too high...or my mind is becoming warped.<br />Harris' novels have tended to surprise me while keeping me on edge for the next chapter. The title grabbed my attention imediately, practically demanding that I purchase the book and do so without delay. Unfortunately, the content was not even close to what the title hinted at. Although it was an easy read, both the plot and ending were predictable.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun its a bunch of mini games that u unlock as u progress in the game its a lot of fun and and just so cool
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|What a great movie to provide an insight into the Seals.  It is amazing how they interact with each other -- and the training they go through is mind blowing.  Would recommend this to anyone who likes a good adventure.  It is true to life, and includes some heartbreak.  Kudos to our military forces for putting your very best people through the Seal program.  Definitely a 5 star movie.
0345803507|5.0|I had to order the collection after all the girls at the office were talking about them.  Love it, love it, love it!  I have read the series twice and plan on reading them again as soon as my sister gets them back to me!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|A super fun game that I will play everyday! Very fun for all ages. And extremely ADDICTING! fun fun fun

B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so excited to get this app. Works great on my Kindle Fire! I'll probably use the app more than the website now.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|The DVD arrived very promptly .The story is one you have to pay very close attention to as the pieces of the puzzle connect all through the film.It is one you either have to stop and repeat a scene or watch the whole thing over.I hope there is a sequal. A disturbing rape scene you may want to fast forward with eyes shut,volume off.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is a simple enough game to learn to play (connect the dots and fill the grid), but some of the puzzles are rather complex. With a couple of hundred puzzles, it's sure to keep you busy for a while.
0142421375|5.0|I enjoy John Grisham books.  I have a hard time putting his books down.<br />I always want to know what is going to happen next.  I love the Theodore<br />Boone books.
B008XG1X18|1.0|was excited...force closes every other or 3rd pin or page search on Android. nearly impossible to get on kindle, put it on my phone then downloaded off cloud. great idea but def needs help!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I read that one of the persons Lee Child admired early on was John McDonald. I love his work and still regret his passing. Child has much the same style. His characters are \\"big, alive\\" and fun to follow. He is just right in his descriptive narratives. Kep it up.<br />John would be pleased.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its very entertaining, and ADDICTING! Very fun for all ages, but there is a problem with not enough coins, but still a good game overall.
1469984202|4.0|I really liked this book series.  I probably will read more as they come out.  I do have a complaint about the detailed descriptions and the sometimes snail pace of some events, while others happen without ANY description- like the first time Juliette and Lukas communicate after her \\"cleaning.\\"  The author is a talented writer, however, and he keeps the suspense going.  The story was not always predictable, which I like.  The reason I got interested in the book in the first place is partly because my daughter-in-law was reading it, but mostly because she and my son had a science magazine with an article about silo living.  Apparently, someone is selling apartments in a totally self contained underground missle silo- in the event of some catastrophy.  Intriguing- until you read these books.  The endless climbing, which was off-putting to some readers, brought to life what it would be like living in one.  Maybe not so intriguing- LOL.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|How? Why? Umm.....I think E.L. James is a horrible writer, but I continued to read these book! Whose the dumb one? James for writing such a horrible series....sooooooo bad it's good even tho I skimmed over most of the sex scenes because to be honest ENOUGH is ENOUGH.... Or me for continuing to buy them! I wish I had thought of this first!
0596009208|5.0|This is a great book for those who are just starting to work with Java - an easy read, very informative and includes all sorts fo examples and exercises. Definitely a must if you would like to know more about Java.
B0060D2UJU|4.0|I thought this was cute.  Nothing surprising about it or the ending.  Just a mindless hour laughing at the dogs.  And some days this is just what I need.  Streaming works great with my roku.
159562015X|4.0|Our staff of three each read this book and completed the subsequent assessment.  By clearly defining our strengths, we were able to review job descriptions and assign tasks based on our strengths.
B006LSZECO|4.0|My mom, SIL and I all read this on our recent vacation. Captivating story. You couldn't wait to find out where the story would go next. It was a fast read. Only took me 2 days and SIL a mere 24 hours. I found the characters really interesting and had clear pictures of what they might look like. I couldn't believe the twists and turns in the story. Just when you thought you had it all figured out, a monkey wrench inserted itself. I ended up hating the two main characters in the end. She was a truly psycho b****. He turned out to be the ultimate whimp. When it was over, I turned to my SIL and said SERIOUSLY??? What an ending...
1441866868|1.0|Lots of hype about this book. Perhaps I my expectations were too high. Read 10 chapters. Just did not get into the story. Really liked the idea. Sorry. Yawner.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book! I recommend it to anyone who likes a quick, fun read. The book was amazing, okay? Okay. The characters were hysterical and easy to follow. Okay.
B0088X7YU0|4.0|This CGI was surprisingly good. Obviously nothing can compare to the original movie but this is a quality entry in the starship troopers line of films. Lots of fan service with appearances from the big players.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|you gotta see it to believe it!  keeps you on the edge of your seat!!!  one i can watch over and over!
B005SCSL56|5.0|I am an avid reader and have never posted about a book until today. As a fan of Glee, I know who Chris Colfer is and was very excited to hear he had written a children's book. I wanted to read it because I have grandchildren. I found this book at my local library.  After reading the introduction and part of the first chapter, I bought a copy for my Kindle.  I read it and am in love with this book. If you are a parent or grandparent, get this book for your kids.  It is not only a good read, but it has great life lessons. Thank you Chris for such a wonderful addition to literature!!!!!
B000002KKC|4.0|Wow - this could have been an absolutely amazing single album but it has a few too many stinkers for a double album (which is so often the case) - much like the Beatles White Album to which it is so often compared.  OK think about it - take the 12 best songs: Over & Over, Think About Me, Sara, Storms,  Sisters Of The Moon, Angel, Never Make Me Cry, I Know I'm Not Wrong, Honey Hi, Beautiful Child, Tusk and Never Forget and WOW what an album!!!  5 stars for sure!  You can forget: The Ledge, Save Me A Place, What Makes You Think You're The One, That's All For Everyone, Not That Funny, That's Enough For Me, Brown Eyes, and Walk A Thin Line -- which all forgettable (and mostly Buckingham) filler.  Still worth the purchase but unfortunately you have to get the 2-disc deluxe version to get the must-have full length Sara.
B001CO42LG|5.0|If you like smooth jazz with  vocals then I think you will enjoy this CD. Wonderful music. You can't go wrong on any of their CD's.
B00009RAJH|4.0|Almosts as good as Rumours but has a few too many bad songs where Runours only has one stinker with \\"Oh Daddy\\".  This starts out great with Monday Morning, Warm Ways, Blue Letter, Rhiannon and Over My Head but the rest is mixed with Say You Love Me, Landslide and I'm So Afraid being very good and a few stinkers with Crystal, Sugar Daddy and the really bad World Turning.  Oh well, still a very good album.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|good game challenging<br />I would recommend it to all my friends<br />addictive. like you wouldn't believe.<br />I. cant stop playing it.
B000002KGT|4.0|Very very rare when every song on an album is really good.  That is almost the case here except for Oh Daddy which is a real stinker!  Really too  bad they didn't include the very fine Silver Spring in its place - then this truly would be one of the best albums of all time!  Still very good.
0553386794|5.0|Great book!! LOVE the characters and the unpredictability! Its the perfect combination of fantasy and fiction! Plus the HBO series that coupled with it was basically word-for-word with the book!
0345803485|1.0|Let's Begin<br />Hmmm, the cover. Simply put there is elegance in simplicity. So no bad comments here.<br />So first, why did I want to read and review a book that's so obviously not my type?<br />Peer Pressure. I soooo, should have said no. NO.<br />Say no to drugs and apparently work written from the use of drugs.<br /><br />Normally I would begin by discussing the plot of the book. I can't do that today since there was no plot. Much like Magic Mike (yes, I went and seen it and I'd do it again if I wanted cause I heart Channeling Tatum) the story itself was missing. It was much like a sail boat sitting in the water because there was no wind. Quite bluntly, there was no point to to the storyline other than Anastasia pussyfooting around the idea of entering a relationship (coughs) with the Christian Grey. Oh, and the two getting it on like rabbits. Freaky ones. To sum the book up nicely though, the girl met guy, guy chased ....I mean stalked girl, they got it on, they got it on, they got it on with chains, they got it on with whips, they continued to get it on, girl left guy in the suckest ending of endings that sucked.Honestly, I was really surprised by the whole lack of something actually happening. All my friends and family have been yapping on for months about how they LOVED this book. Which is weird since they ALL tend to come to me for book recommendations. I read the books, not them. Well, I don't know what they've been smoking but I didn't see anything to love in the pages of Fifty Shades.<br /><br />The writing.<br />I hate to say this but the writing style wasn't bad. Yeah, surprised me too. Still, the level of difficulty seemed more like that of a YA writer rather than an author aiming for an adult audience. I kept forgetting that this was a mommy porn book and then would get surprised and shocked when I came to the dirty parts.<br />Which are in fact as dirty as old man porn.<br />Which is pretty much what this book should have been intended for. Which brings me to an important question.How are women finding this crap erotic? Seriously, a man that stalks and wants to correct you through the use of whips and paddles is considered romantic? You want romantic? Go back a few years and read Spark's book, A Walk To Remember.Geesh!<br /><br />As for the characters, well lets just say big props to the perverted mind that created psycho, Christian Grey. Ms. James did a excellent job on that loony toon and I would know seeing how my mother is all kinds of messed up herself. As for Ana, I can only say that she irked me on so many levels that I pretty much wanted to put her over my own knee, just not in the nasty way that Christian prefers.<br /><br />Overall. I can honestly say I regret ever cracking open my kindle, for which I read this book on.<br />Now, I must go find some sanitizer...for my eyes.<br /><br />P.S. To be fair, some people might find this work their cup of tea. For me, this was like drinking urine.
0553582038|4.0|I just finished this book, so going to offer my thoughts while they are fresh in my mind.<br /><br />This book is probably the worst in the series so far, but definitely still a good read.  The reason I say it is the worst of the series, is because it's all about setting the stage for the events of the next book.  There's little intrigue, action or battles to be had in this book.  Furthermore, the author cuts out about half of the characters in this book, focusing primarily on those characters based around Kings Landing.  He doesn't get to Danaerys, Jon Snow, Tyrion, etc. until the next book, so there is going to be some confusion trying to bounce back in fourth between the two books in order to keep the timeline correct in your head.<br /><br />On the bright side, this book gives Cersei a little bit of what she deserves!  ;)  A solid 4 star rating, and a strong recommendation, because hopefully everything it is setting up for the next book, makes up for the heartbreak of some tragedies from previous books.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|A well thought out game!  Objects are exceptionally well.  Runs great on my Asus Transformer Pad running ice cream sandwich.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I bought this book after voraciously reading the Wardstone Trilogy.  I tend to read at least 20 reviews before purchase and by the third I had made up my mind on Blood Song.<br /><br />I read Blood Song straight through and highly recommend it to those who want a little more than sword and sorcery. This book is on par with some of my faves including David Gemmell and the Fionavar Trilogy. Ryan writes, intriguing characters, full blooded description and has a knack for developing human relationships. Waiting to see what is next for Al Sorna!!!!!<br />Thank you Anthony Ryan!!
B0069P0DU2|5.0|My family has made chocolates and ice from this non stop since receiving it a few weeks ago.<br />Very durable, and a lot of fun!
0547569653|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is captivating from the start, and I could not put it down.  I loved the recipes, photos, and the way he overcame a challenging childhood.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|This a relaxing linkin park I like it as I do all linkin park music nothing beats the first album will always be my favorite
B002N44XSG|4.0|Great!  Loved it especially that teddy/Annabeth part!!!!;D totally EMBARASSING for Annabeth.  SHOCKING for Annabeth to like Percy.  Cretins.  Love Percy's JOKES!
030758836X|4.0|This was a directive: \\"Read Gone Girl.\\" OK. The pitch blurb did nothing to inform me that I would be able to finish it and enjoy it. Only the reading did that. It took me three days, but if my schedule had been clear it would have been a very sleepy 20 hour marathon.<br /><br />What initially set the hook for me was the quality of the two voice writing, revealed in the first tow chapters. Especially the voice of the husband. It meant a lot to me, reading the acknowledgements, how much research and Q&A were involved in creating such a convincing bit of male-ness. Speaking as both a man and a writer, I know real when I read it. The reason: it unhinges me slightly. The unhinged feeling is always a tip-off that the author has succeeded in writing honestly. So, my hats are off to Ms. Flynn on that level and many more.<br /><br />She also managed to keep me connected with a First-Person point of view story. That POV is one I rarely choose to read because it makes me nervous. Understanding that, I know exactly why she decided to write it that way. It can be as annoying as her characters were, so it worked perfectly. At least for me.  Like the character Nick, I wasn't about to let her get away with anything, so I stuck it out, feeling completely manipulated and man-handled the entire trip through the pages. Good for the author!<br /><br />I won't reveal any spoilers here, only that the story unfolded to the only logical conclusion it could have, short of a step into a train or fast moving bus. Thankfully, the author stooped in neither direction. The fact that she leaves me feeling that way is just one more example of the real genius in her writing. I learned a great deal on my way through the book, mostly about how people reveal what they can or what they want to, even in a marriage. Especially in a marriage.<br /><br />So, I can safely say that I may or may not recommend this brilliantly written book to anyone who wants to read it. It depends...
B008EL4YX6|4.0|I really enjoyed the 60 levels to start out.  The third (of over 6,000 now) user created levels that I tried seemed impossible though.  I finally gave up on it and created my own.  after I uploaded it (you have to solve it to do this to make sure it is possible) I went back to play it one more time...only to find out it was wrong and was indeed impossible... there were two changes after uploading it and I cannot go back and edit the level and try again... guess I'll have to start over.  Still a very good game, but if you think a level is impossible, you may want to give up because you may be right.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|Grade: C-<br /><br />L/C Ratio: 20/80<br />(This means I estimate the author devoted 20% of his effort to creating a literary work of art and 80% of his effort to creating a commercial bestseller.)<br /><br />Thematic Breakdown:<br />50% - Sappy love story<br />25% - Time travel<br />15% - Cultural inspection<br />10% - US history<br /><br />I want to make it clear up front that I am a Stephen King novice. Prior to 11/22/63, the only work of his I had read was 2010's Under the Dome (which I can't recommend) and a few excerpts from On Writing.<br /><br />King's new novel is a big book. It comprises over 800 pages in paper form and over 13,000 locations on the Kindle. I'm not morally opposed to long texts, but in this case, the novel's plot is not worthy of the length.<br /><br />As you can see from the thematic breakdown above, I estimate that 50% of the book is spent on a romantic arc. Despite all the time King devotes to the love story, he never delivers a believable relationship (and the corniness will elicit one groan per page). The cheesy romance kills the momentum of the alternative history premise, and the repetitive scenes where the main character stalks a relatively dull Lee Harvey Oswald only add to the book's problems.<br /><br />Like a lot of time traveling literature, 11/22/63 requires some clunky exposition to get situated. Sadly, for fans of King (and fans of JFK too, I guess) that setup is the only compelling part of the novel.
B0071BY2OG|3.0|This DVD content was just 'ok'.  I've seen the other films, and this one does not do anything groundbreaking.  Seemed to be more like a recap of the motoGP season if anything.  Could have been better by doing more behind the scenes and bike prep etc... or even spending some time with the riders in their personal lives.  I suppose if you're a diehard motogp fan, then this would be the next logical DVD to watch...
B004G5ZY7E|3.0|Grade: C<br /><br />L/C Ratio: 20/80<br />(This means I estimate the author devoted 20% of his effort to creating a literary work of art and 80% of his effort to creating a commercial bestseller.)<br /><br />Thematic Breakdown:<br />50% - Detective mystery<br />30% - Action/Adventure<br />10% - Horror<br />10% - Romance<br /><br />I don't know what is wrong with me. This is twice in a row I've broken my own rule and read a book from a series. And in both cases I jumped right into the middle of the series instead of starting from the beginning like a sensible human being. Although in the case of The Snowman, I didn't have much of a choice since not all of Jo Nesbo's novels have been translated from Norwegian to English yet.<br /><br />I was worried the whole foreign translation thing would be an issue, but the language flows relatively well throughout the book. (My one complaint regarding word choice is that it feels like the term \\"duvet\\" appears five times per chapter. Maybe people in Norway just really love their bedding.)<br /><br />Look, The Snowman is a serviceable detective mystery. The serial killer plot creates some intricate puzzles and suspenseful moments, which makes certain chapters legitimate page-turners. But the characters are largely stale, and as the number of twists in the investigation grows, the outcome begins to feel less shocking and more arbitrary.
B008RJFRTK|5.0|I love this app; it looks sparse when one first looks at it, but it has many features that make travel easier...and you can use it without internet or wi-fi connections, which make it great for being on the road. One can use the GPS feature to zero the map in to where you are, then the search feature to find restaurants, gas stations, atm machines and transportation access points. One can zoom as close as one wishes, or zoom out to find places nearby.<br /><br />It takes very little to get used to it, and if you travel a lot, there are maps available for any place in the world. I couldn't recommend it more
B0087OXDDC|5.0|Phrasal Verb Fun gives you back your enthusiasm for learning English. It doesn't just list the meaning of verbs, but it also provides you with their original meaning, their habitual uses or lines from songs, for instance, so that memorizing them becomes less complicated. And this is precisely the element that gives Phrasal Verb Fun its creative and refreshing value. It even suggests associations of ideas that make it very easy to remember the right preposition. Thanks, Peter, for your good work.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It took considerable effort to read this book, especially in comparison to the first two.  It seemed rushed and countless details were glazed over.  It'll be interesting to see if a movie studio would consider trying to bring this to the big screen, because if they did, they'll have to rewrite half of the screenplay because of the lack of detail.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful app! I have it on both my phone and kindle. I love that there are so many translations available at my fingertips and the audio options are perfect for listening to the Bible at work or in the car, etc. Also, it is much more user-friendly since the last update.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I got the 1st one for free on amazon. I love every thing about the game it never freezes. I did not like the fact it stopped me in the middle of my game just to rate the app. it did say maybe later. but it was to late I was already disturbed. I was gonna give the app a 5 star rating but now i'm not. and if when i'm done playing number 2 if im happy I will tell my friends abou it
030758836X|5.0|This book is cleverly written. Its rare that a book keeps my interest all the way, Gone Girl did!!  Definitely a page-turner!
B004EKCNMA|2.0|ok i watched this at my grandmothers house, i enjoyed the movie (it was well done not uber sugar coated and not rediculous) until it got to the final spirit. then there is that ridiculous chase seen and just seems shoved in there and is obviously designed as a cheap thrill. It had no point. So in disgust i stopped watching it there.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I hate going through pictures on a small screen, it bothers me and takes away some of the fun in pictures, but this solved that for me immediately.  I would just plug it into my iPad with my SD card and instantly I would be able to see and view all my pictures and videos on the iPads brilliant and colorful display.  I would highly recommend if you take pictures alot and want to be able to pleasantly view them and edit them on the go.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and im half way through the second book but it is worth reading.<br />It is amazing how you become involved in the story sometimes you feel like you could get angry with the person in the book but then you think the other person is naive not knowing what she is letting herself in for should be more careful but i really enjoyed the book .

B008VDJFFY|4.0|OK So I totally wasn't expecting this book to be what it was about.(And I'm not going to say here cause it'll wreck the surprise)<br /><br />I, incorrectly, made the assumption that it was band or music related as it had been recommended to me as a good read after Thoughtless and the cover had a stage on it etc. It's not.<br /><br />Also I am not a huge fan of poetry in any form but in this scenario it really worked for me.<br /><br />I wasn't overly keen on Lake but by the end she had won me over. She acted a little immature & stupid for me in the first half of the book but it helped to emphasis the mature decisions she made later in the book & we got to see her growth.<br /><br />Will is so sweet & romantic & just wants to do the right thing by everyone regardless as to whether he is happy or not.<br /><br />Overall I really liked this but it just fell short of me LOVING it.<br /><br />And OMG I nearly forgot Eddie....Eddie is awesome! The part with her 18th birthday had me in floods!<br />I'm loving how a lot of YA authors are writing wonderful female best friends. Every girl needs one :)<br /><br />I would say that this is the older end of YA IMO. There aren't any sexy scenes but they are 18 and 21 and there is some cussing and adult themes etc.<br />Well worth a read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|For the life of me, I cannot understand what all the hoopla is about with this book...I couldn't wait to read it after hearing some of my friends & relatives say it was great...They must have read another book by the same name...I kept flipping the pages thinking its going to get better,but it never did.  I understand that people loved the sex scenes & I am not against them at all if it relates to the plot,but I just found them to be boring after hearing the same thing over & over...As for the characters, I found Anna to be totally unrealistic & yes,just boring...She was just so one-dimensional that I never could even LIKE her, much less RELATE to her. As for Grey,he was just plain weird with no personality at all to like or dislike...Again, I am an avid reader but I like books to be entertaining with in-depth characters and keep me guessing....This one is just so totally predictable...A friend told me the second one is better but I just can't bring myself to make the effort to try it...Sorry I tried the first one...
1469984202|5.0|Hugh Howey makes other scifi authors look silly. The genre is riddled with high concepts and formulaic junk food. The plotting reflects the authors have merely gone through the motions to meet a page requirement while the characters are shallow and boring shells who serve only to advance the predictable plot. Any reader of this instant scifi classic can tell you: nothing is shallow in the world of Wool.
0345803485|1.0|This book was poorly written and insulting to women everywhere. You do not have to let a man get his way every time to get him to love you. You do not have to let a man do things to your body that make you uncomfortable. I thought the sex scenes were over the top as well. The grammar is bad and so is the story. It is not sexy to bite your lip and \\"oh, jeez\\"  is not a sentence. I kept waiting for something redeeming but never found it.
068987474X|3.0|The author comes off as a douchebag, because he states the obvious. The moral or the story, guys say what they mean 95% of the time, and if they are not saying what they mean its because they are scared of the girl killing them or herself. Prteyy much sums up the whole book. No Da vinci code here.

But if you're like me and have some experience in design and creating slides, you will find it very basic. That said you might still enjoy the design of the book and all the lovely examples in it. But I really recommend you get the physical book. I've read the e-book version (pdf) and it's really not adapted for the format.

Like many recordings from this era of both Coltrane + Davis, it's not unusual for some of the playing to sound rough or a little off key. In a way this is the beauty of these recordings because playing music is not a perfect thing. This is not smooth jazz or Kenny G wallpaper sound. A piece of history. Buy it.

B004SRNH10|1.0|I needed this app to read a magazine I subscribe to yearly that specifically request Adobe Air for its' content format. This download is unresponsive...<br /><br />08/22/2012<br /><br />Well, Amazon instructed me to contact Adobe. They gave me an email link . I spent about another hour composing an email with all the details. It was sent back with an error saying the address does not exist. I double checked the address and it's the same as the address sent to me<br /><br />In the meantime, I checked out AIR's technical specs on the Adobe site. According to them,  AdobeAir  app is only compatible with the BLACKBERRY ARM PROCESSOR. So, the problem is the Amazon site has to make sure the compatibility info is correct, so that other types of tablets won't download this app.

B0060FXBNM|4.0|I still think the first movie is my favorite of the 3, but I enjoyed all of these movies pretty well...I felt they were good modern movie takes on a toy & cartoon I actually grew up with.  It was cool that they got the same guy to do the voice of Optimus that di it in the original cartoon too...cool that he's still around.  I think one or two of the others may have had the same voicework too, but not entirely sure.<br /><br />Anyway, though I thought perhaps maybe a few things could have been done better throughout the course of the 2nd & 3rd films, I felt none the less that they were awesome and action packed, with a good amount of appropriate humor mixed in throughout them as well.  I own each movie on DVD, but I'm thinking about upgrading them to this Blu-Ray box set sometime soon, so as to get the full high def experience on them, because these are some of the kinds of movies that I like to have in high def because action packed movies like this sound the best...and these types of movies are also my favorite types of movies, other than comedies & certain family movies, but I'm content just getting DVDs of those types of movies.  Sci-fi, action, and epics are the movies to get in high def, because they'll give the best viewing experiences in high def.

B00005JLR2|1.0|I lost the movie Treasure planet when I was younger. When I was finally able to reorder the lost dvd, I was overjoyed. When it came in the mail today, I was greatly excited to pop it into the dvd player. As soon as I put the dvd in, it did not play. I thought maybe the player wasn't working cause I left it for a bit. No matter how much I tried, the dvd wouldn't play. I checked the disc to find that it was beaten up with scratches! I ordered it \\"ACCEPTABLE\\" thinking it would be exactly as it says and still able to play. This is not what I wanted and I can't even watch it! I am very pissed off right now! Thank you for making my day ruined. Now I want my money back!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Quite disappointed in this book.It is one of a series of three. It feels like the author has written one book and conveniently divided it into three books (more profitable?). Apart from that, it reads like a Mills & Boon on steroids. I feel it's rather immature in its style of writing and although the subject matter is aimed at the adult reader, the style seems more attuned to the young adult reader. Very cliched with regard to the characters too, rather boring in that respect, typical wealthy, handsome bad guy, and naive, young, beautiful virgin. Please, give us readers some credit! Interestingly, I was expecting the S & M stuff to be really extreme which it wasn't, it was pretty tame which makes me think it's just another love story with a very mild kinky theme to get us to buy it. I definitely won't be purchasing the next two volumes.  The theme of the story seemed familiar and I do recall pinching my mum's book, back in the 70's called the \\"Story of O\\"....

B004LROMWU|4.0|I bought the first season on my PS3 through Amazon Instant.<br /><br />Very nice concept to the show for a Sci-Fi fan.  The execution so far needs to bump up the action and better develop characters you truly want to be involved intellectually and emotionally with their story from show to show.  Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he said:<br /><br />As it stands, the show had a decent (if not spectacular) debut but needs to heighten the action and human drama in its sophomore year. It has a talented cast, they just need to be allowed to shine. I want to love \\"Falling Skies,\\" but merely like it. As a viewer, I need an urgency from the writing that makes me feel like I'm in the trenches with heroes that I really care about in a meaningful way. I just haven't gotten there yet.<br /><br />Same here.  I said to my wife last episode pretty much the same thing.  Im feeling it won't survive to a 3rd season if it does not.

B00005RHF8|3.0|This version was originally aired in theaters in the UK, but only on television here in the US. Although the DVD claims to be \\"digitally remastered,\\" the quality is still, quite frankly, terrible. Apparently the story goes that the original film was lost somewhere along the line, so the video releases use the TV version. That is apparent with bad, cuts and jumps in scenes that pop up occasionally throughout the movie, most likely at points where there were commercial breaks. After the fire in Rochester's room, Jane asks him if Grace Poole started the fire. One problem with that- there was no mention of the name \\"Grace Poole\\" at any time in the movie before this! That must have been a scene to have gotten cut, or the writers are morons. Take your pick.The picture isn't good, and despite boasting a score by John Williams, the sound isn't either.<br /><br />Despite being only an  hour and a half, the film starts with a length opening credits scene before young Jane arrives at Lowood. What the purpose of that was, I'm still not sure!<br /><br />Susannah York as Jane was gorgeous and at nearly 20 years too old, but her performance was pretty good. I liked that George C. Scott's Rochester was not very good-looking, but the lines about him not being handsome were cut for some reason! So disappointing. I thought Ian Bannen was too passionate as St. John and not enough the cold, unfeeling character of the book.<br /><br />Overall, this version was actually pretty decent. I couldn't find many negative things to say about it, really, which is a good thing. . Despite being too old, the cast did a pretty good job overall. Ultimately it suffered from time constraints. Other than the horrible picture and audio quality of the DVD, it's really not bad It's a shame that the original film was supposedly lost! Maybe it will somehow be miraculously found one day?

0307592731|4.0|That is how the friend who recommended this book to me described it and I agree! While parts were not pleasant to read, I admire the author's guts for being honest...warts and all. I read some of the one star reviews and by far most were appalled at her choices and 'lack of morals.' I certainly don't agree with the choices she made in some areas of her life, but I do admire her for putting it out there. I found the story fascinating. The parts that made me cringe and ask \\"Seriously?!\\" were so few compared to the other parts I enjoyed completely.

B00122HW92|4.0|I have this dvd and it was good to see the three of them playing together again. The only disappointment for me was Clapton seemed a bit rigid in his attitude. The song 'White Room' when it came out in the late sixties, used a wah pedal to give it a distinctive sound but for whatever reason, Clapton decided not to use it on this version much to my disappointment. As far as Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, they still seemed to have what it took to play. Bruce is showing his age however; there was a stool for him to set on occasionally.<br />In my opinion, Clapton peaked with Cream. They were the quintessential power trio of rock. (With the exception of the Jimi Hendrix Experience)<br />All things considered, this was a good dvd.

B00687XO1G|5.0|Yeah, Ben Gazzara is the young Army Lt. who is accused of murder. The Lt. does not dispute the charges, but instead claims his wife was raped by the victim and that he killed the culprit in a rage. The complex courtroom drama that ensues is ground breaking on many levels. The Hays code was in its death throes, soon to fall victim to a group of films and directors that refused to adhere (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe and Blowup are the two in the mid 60s that finally killed this code). But Anatomy of a Murder was among the early films to challenge the Hays code (the same year as Some Like It Hot). In Anatomy of a Murder, the film graphically discusses rape and murder, a first since the Hays code came into being.<br /><br />The film has been restored with Criterion's amazing software, keeping the sharpness of the picture and reducing grain and noise (unlike cheaper restoration filters that blur the picture). The picture and sound quality of the Blu-Ray is pretty amazing. I do highly recommend spending the extra dollars if you have a player. There are a good number of extras, though nothing really to exciting. The included booklet with an essay is nice, but it's not something that can't be easily found online.<br /><br />The film features terrific acting by Stewart and a young George C. Scott, some great directing and set design and framing; but the supporting cast can be a bit dull and lifeless at times. It just seems that Stewart and Scott are stealing the show. Much of the film takes place in a courtroom, so if you do not like courtroom dramas, then run away! The case stays central to the film, not much time is spent on tangent stories. Even what seems like a side story, wild goose chase ends up being central to the story. And you can really see where many later courtroom drama films took inspiration, A Few Good Men comes to mind.<br /><br />So I do find it tough to spend $24 on the film, especially since I have it available at a local library. But even then, I would hesitate to purchase this film. The price vs extras vs re-watch-ability don't add up. I feel this is more of a rent it from Netflix and watch it once every blue moon kind of film. Save your $ for the amazing Criterion releases of Kurosawa, Ozu, Fellini, or the out of print Hitchcock Criterion releases (Rebecca, Notorious). If you are a fan, then by all means, spend away. The Blu-Ray is worth the extra dough.uld hesitate to purchase this film. The price vs extras vs re-watch-ability don't add up.

B0079R8KXG|5.0|After reviewing the choices and features of Kindle case covers, I chose the Marware Vibe case cover with stand.  My Kindle Fire fits perfectly and was very easy to install.  The clips that hold the Kindle are secure, and I don't worry about it falling out of the case.  It is compact and a perfect fit.  I chose the red one and am very pleased with the color as it is a true bright red.  The front is embossed and the back is smooth. It's very well made with tight even black stitching around the edges.  The black elastic band keeps it closed when not in use. The back of the cover bends so I can use it as a stand.  If you think $24.99 is pricey, think again.  All of the cheaper ones I saw in stores were just that-cheap.  I am very happy with this cover.  It also comes in black and purple.

B0084IG7KC|3.0|As you know, this film made a lot of money, yet it looks like a low-budget film.  It looks like a film from the early 80's and I see nothing that says 2012!  I do not like the look of the film as many characters have strange hairdos which is the usual stereotypical \\"futuristic hairdo\\" which are complete with cuts that are weird.<br /><br />This is one of those dystopian films where you assume it is the future, but by the looks of things, the time period is all over the place.  On the on hand it looks like the future, on the other it looks like the 1940's or earlier.  I really hate when films do this.  The special effects were sorry as well.  If there were some that I did not notice, then maybe they were great.<br /><br />The story is one that we can relate to today.  Athletes from poor communities compete for fame and wealth given by the elites in order to give them HOPE that they can be something that they are not and be on the side with the elite.  Little do they realize that they are only entertainment and nothing more.  They make no decisions, hold no power (only popularity), plan nothing and all they have comes from the elite in terms of money and fame.  You go against the elite and they take it away, just ask Chad Johnson!<br /><br />The Hunger Games world is one that we live in today, just not as stripped down and with the aura of freedom, but we are never free.  Having to pay taxes when you don't want to is a prime example of not being free.  Don't pay taxes and you are off to jail and everything that you worked for is taken away!  Ask Red Foxx!  What the Hunger Games does is to give us a glimpse into the madness of the ruling elite in their quest for one-world government (with them at the head of course - something has to lead it) with 'certain' people at the top and everyone else as slaves.<br /><br />In order to bring about a world government, the rich - who literally own all of the money, but up everyone's property and possessions (Cash for Gold!), ruinthe economy (one that they built in order to benefit ONLY them), make people desperate enough to accept socialism (with a patsy leader implementing it) which is CONTROLLED (rationed) wealth, which in turn makes people NOT want to compete, with the idea that the elite will have no future challengers to their rule!  Of course no religion (except that of the elites, which only they can practice) also helps to eliminate any ideological opposition as well.  Socialism does not allow the type of wealth which could create weapons, payoffs etc. of any would-be challenger to power.  Hitler wanted a 1,000 reich, and so do the elite.  The thing that has eluded empires throughout history was how to take the ENTIRE world and keep under their rule.  This part is still being played out as they continue to take out \\"rogue\\" (not under their control) nations and nations with advanced war capability.<br /><br />For pointing out the world that we live in and the sorry world that we may be headed towards, this film is good at pointing that out.  As far as the presentation of the film - I don't like it.  I also did not like the lone black girl in an every man for himself killing game, the black girl somehow finds some \\"good ol\\" fried chicken!  They never forget to add that do they?  The same could be said of the lame love story.  There are 23 people in a game - a game of death, and they have to kill each other so that only one remains.  Why are some people concerned about other people's well being?  I know the point of the film was to show how the elites will make you do what they want, including becoming a killing machine, then they give you wealth, homes and you are deemed \\"OK,\\" but why did some care about the other when their lives were on the line?  I guess the ending gives us a clue.  I won't tell that.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray quality is good, but the picture is a little softer than I would prefer.  Not a bad film overall, just nothing that I would add to my collection unless you area fan of the book.

I just bought and watched the digital version of the film here, and can say that I appreciate the movie now, more than ever. I've also read the other books in the series and look forward to seeing the film adaptation of those. If you enjoyed this movie I highly recommend you read the book.

Boring!!! I think that so many think that redundant 'blues' licks, vocal acrobatics and busy arpeggios are all that matter anymore.<br /><br />This CD is full of extremely pleasant, well written and nicely arranged MUSIC. It has all the elements of great writing, melody, outstanding groove (thanks to the wonderful drumming of Matt Chamberlain!), excellent recording and a whole bunch of subtle, musical beauty!<br /><br />Let's say that this recording has rekindled hope in me that there really are young artists who know how to make great music. The songs are very memorable and are quite singable. I predict a number of hits will come from this record! I sure hope so! After all, we all remember the 'hits' we've known and loved over the years.<br /><br />No matter if you're listening intently or listening passively, this is one helluva good record! Thanks Jason!

B008CJ0JTI|5.0|After waiting too long to obtain my favorite movie on Blu-ray, I recently gave in and purchased a no-frills import. I'm very happy indeed to see that I can soon replace it with a better disc which includes what appears to be some fine extras--including an alternate ending.
B00881VLCE|5.0|if I am having a hard time sleeping I just get this game out and I relax away. I also like the fact you can get more puzzles for FREE there are some you have to pay money but the FREE ones are still great
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is amazing. I love how it is an ongoing notification. Tells when its charging. Definetley a must get wondering what the cost version has because this one is definetly great!
B001BCRGEE|5.0|Broken Boy Soldiers is undeniably Jack White in style, but with a twist. I personally prefer the front half of the album to the rest. The first several songs are a bit more upbeat.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is fun and entertaining. I like playing it helps pass the time though I got the game for my kids
B0067Q42BY|4.0|but I feel the same as others do about the ads. I still really enjoy the game though, so I'll keep playing it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I think almost everyone would love this book.  People born from 1945 and later will especially enjoy it,  because it brings back so much of our childhood!  The songs, commercials, clothes, schools and culture come  roaring back to life.  It brings back situations and people you haven't thought about in years. I don't think that I will ever say again, \\"If only I would have done it another way, my life would be different.\\"  Thank you Mr. King for such an enjoyable book!!!!!
B001UV4XIS|2.0|It seems the more complicated the story became, the simpler the movie version.  So much of the detail was left out of these movies, they weren't  worth watching.
0345802934|2.0|I'm in the camp of people who didn't like this book.<br /><br />1. For what it tries to do it's far too long. Part of the story is about a mystical bestseller \\"Air Chrysalis\\". 1Q84 tries to be just as mystical, but unlike \\"Air Chrysalis\\" it can definitely not be read in one sitting. There is a complete mismatch between form and content.<br /><br />2. It's unsatisfying. Throughout the book there is the question whether the \\"little people\\" are real, and what they are. Only at the very end of the book is there a partial answer, and then a very unsatisfying one.<br /><br />3. The translated prose entirely fails to affect me. There is not a single passage that is remarkable from a writing point of view: it's all just words that carry the story forward, never words that are beautiful for their own sake.<br /><br />4. The two main characters largely fail to charm the reader. They are empty shells. The second female character is even more so, and it's only the two minor male characters from the first part who become in any way interesting towards the end.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Excellent product -- It paired right away with my new Zik Parrot headphones.  Works perfectly, with full control of both my iPod classic and nano. I highly reccomed it.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|. . . And all the while the depth/personalities of the characters came through;motivation and mentalities were evident throughout. Simply, a great, smart action flick with sumptuous scenes from all around the globe. Highly entertaining. Typical of the entertainment Tom Cruise keeps putting out. Amazing stunts, especially from a man pushing 50, too. To do it justice, go with BluRay; it's worth the few extra bucks.
030758836X|5.0|This was a great book. I loved it from start to finish. I was always kept guessing and the end was shocking. I won't be a spoiler. Like someone else said, \\"Just go and buy this book!\\"
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this is a awsome game!  i wish it can be my live wallpaper and i think this is best game yet!! p.s worth it
B0031OCY2E|4.0|Based on a Wall Street Journal expose, this weird film never really explodes, but you do want to watch it because Matt Damon is great as an industrial geek who engineers a scheme to get control of his company by faking a price-fixing scandal and involving the FBI. The lies pile up, and we are never really too sure when reality sets in. It's odd material for a Hollywood movie because there's little action. It's mostly a character study of the lead man, whose quirks and foibles are emphasized by his frequent voice-overs, posed as his passing rapid non-sequitor thoughts. Interesting.
B0061S0A64|4.0|it is a great game I got it when it was free just to try it out now I am addicted to it though it often stops in mid game and is a complete battery killer
B003L20ICE|5.0|Once in awhile you come across a movie that hits on something real. This is one of those rare creatures. It's a family picture, but offbeat because the two parents are middle-aged lesbians: Annette Benning looking very old, and Julianne Moore. Their two kids are basically well-adjusted teens. Everything comes apart when the kids track down their sperm donor, Mark Ruffalo (one of my favorite actors), and he and Moore fall for each other. Things get emotional. Great script. Wonderful acting. Great score. I can't praise this enough. It had me hooked.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Children's movie, very funny, my nephews loved it. You can see the family. It arrived in excellent condition and still continue to see. Highly Recommended.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|I just saw this movie for probably the third time because it was on the tube last week. I decided to write a review of it even though it's twelve years old because it's a movie that is still relevant and better than any movie I've seen in the last several years.  This movie portrays, in all its stark detail, the modern man's dilemma.  In a sense, Douglas' character \\"Bill\\" is a modern day Holden Caulfield, Willy Loman, and Meursault (from THE STRANGER) all rolled into one.  The writers of this script give us a real person behind the headline \\"Man brandishes gun in McDonalds\\" (or any similar headline).  The genius behind this character and Douglas' portrayal of him is that the audience can actually feel sympathy AND empathy for him.  The frustrations that Bill experiences are ones that all of us have been through:  robot-like \\"rule-enforcers\\" (e.g., at 11:33 a.m. \\"Sorry, sir, but we stopped serving breakfast at 11:30\\"), greedy people (e.g., you have to buy an .85 soda to get change to use the pay phone), haters (e.g., the Neo-Nazi nutcase thrift store owner), the traffic jams, criminals who rome the streets freely able to harass othes, etc., etc., etc.  This is what makes Bill's, \\"So, I'm the bad guy?\\" at the end so poignant.<br /><br />This movie is also great for the contrasts it sets up.  Duvall's character, the police detective Prendergast, is a foil for Bill. He has also lost his daughter (she died), has a bad marriage, and has \\"existed\\" in his career for years rather than enjoying it. Yet he doesn't become unhinged as Douglas does because he realizes and accepts the hypocrisy of the world, whereas Bill cannot. As Prendergrast says to Bill at the end, \\"They lie to everybody.\\"  A contrast is also set up between Bill and the Neo-Nazi thrift store owner. It is an unfortunate habit of people to paint others with a broad brush, and the directors subtly make the point that Bill--despite becoming unhinged--is not the same type of person as the Neo-Nazi.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a brutally honest commentary on modern society and on our perpetual struggle to survive in it.

B007BVNW10|5.0|This is a fantastic show that HBO has produced.  I love it.  I am completely hooked on it.  It is so good, that even watching the reruns is exciting.  The costumes are superb and the characters are great.  HBO isn't afraid to kill of major characters either, refreshing for a series.  So who will win the Game of Thrones?  I don't know, but can't wait to find out.  And by the way, I am not normally someone who is interested in Fantasy media, but this really is a great series.<br />[[ASIN:B007HJ84ZK Winter Is Coming]][[ASIN:B007BVJZ0C Making Game of Thrones [HD]]]
B008602KQI|5.0|I have read the book and my hats off to the screenwriter, director,cast and crew!  It could have been a very violent, bloody movie, yet it was done with good taste and sensitivity.  You could feel and see the emotions in Katniss from the horror of hearing her sister's name called in the reaping; to her spotting Gale with Prim sitting on his shoulders, upon her return to District 12, and the love Peeta had for Katniss by the way he looked at her, almost from the moment he came up on the stage at the reaping.  The death scene with Rue was as touching and even more heart-wrenching then it was in the book.  I know this is one we will watch again, of course I am eagerly looking forward to seeing book 2 \\"[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)]]\\" also brought to life.  Must add that the selection of Woody Harrelson as Haymitch and Donald Sutherland as Snow were excellent.<br />Thank you for a very enjoyable movie.
0307592731|1.0|When I first heard about this book, I really wanted to read it.  It is hyped as an adventure about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail and how the author deals with some personal problems.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It mainly deals with how the author blames all her problems on her deceased mother and others around her.  Her \\"pity party\\" is the main theme and hiking the Pacific Crest Trail is secondary.  There are some other events that are disturbing which I won't get in to here.  It is difficult to enjoy a book in which you don't like the main character and that is certainly the case with this particular book.  In short, I would not recommend this read.  It is very disappointing.
B000AARKO4|5.0|This is a great movie to watch on a rainy day and w/ company.  It makes for a great conversation piece.  It's really interesting and keeps you on the move while watching.  Great historic/ romantic and action packed film.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Found these books to be very tedious,repetitious and quite frankly a little to \\"detailed\\" in some areas.  It all got a little old and boring. In my opinion... not enough substance. Could all have probably been done in one book.
B008602KQI|1.0|This movie is supposed to be for teenager and all younger kids wanna watch this..<br />I won't let my kid watch this because this movie is ignorant & i have no clue why so many people like this & I do let my kids<br />watch a lot of things that are not age appropriate.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I started skimming it after thirty pages into it.  This is the worst of the three books.  It is boring and horribly written except for the sex scenes which I didn't skim.  The ending is too rushed.  If you're reading it for the sex scenes, just do what I did and skim the unnecessary plot details.  Don't waste your time.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I wasn't expecting much, but I was quite surprised and impressed by this film.  The acting is tight and the soundtrack is perfect.  There's love and action and violence.  I can't put my finger on it, but I absolutely love this movie.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I was shocked when I opened the box because this thing is HUGE.  I was not expecting it's size.  It completely fills the interior of my pc case and would not fit in my smaller case.<br /><br />In order to get the side back on my pc I had to take a hammer and pound out a decorative scalloping in the side plate but now it fits just fine and that's more a failing of the case than anything.<br /><br />So far it's been VERY quiet and after hours of gaming I don't get the temp alarms I was getting.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have never used such a useful app in my life. This app makes my life so much easier. Hallelujah.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book started out with a normal woman going through extraordinary things. She author tied everything in and even provided a cliff hanger at the end so that I immediately had to download the next book in the series.  This is a fascinating story of a witch and a vampire that goes beyond most of the teenybopper stories out there. I will read everything Deborah Harkness writes from here on out.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Its annoying yhu have to leave the app becuz it takes forever to load then when yhu start another game it says sorry its having difficulties or whatever.... I thought I would like it as first timer but idk.... its stressful
B005LAIGF0|5.0|Others have summarized this amazing coming-of-age movie. Let me just add that Kenneth Lonergan has made a masterpiece, and the performances of Anna Paquin, Jeannie Berlin and J. Smith-Cameron are out of this world! The milieu is Manhattan's Upper West Side (with all the ethnicity that implies) but there's a universality here, and real Aristotelian power. At the end I felt pity and terror...very rare in my movie-going experience. Yes, there are flaws. Yes the production had a troubled history. And, no, this movie won't be to everyone's taste. But I view it as a stunning achievement, one not to be missed!
1468161660|5.0|I loved this book. I read it in one sitting, I just couldn't put it down. It was well written, the book was amazing. I cried and laughed and fell in love with the characters. I also read the sequel which was just...WOW! I highly recommend this book and its sequel.
B004B8RWX0|1.0|Predictable, unoriginal and all around retarded. Resident Evil with 1/100th the budget - ugh, had to ff through it. How can it be getting good reviews?? WOW
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|app works as described.  no problems at all.  notifications of new postings arrive as requested and customization settings can adjust them
B004CD7OCI|1.0|After watching the 1st and second episodes and reading all the inexplicably glowing reviews I decided maybe the story would get better, mature, obtain SOME sort of positive or entertaining spin, so I watched this third episode. OMG!!! How is this dribble getting five starts?!! It HAS to be the AMC people, horrible HORRIBLE acting, storyline. ugh, I want my money back WITH interest for having lost those minutes of my life. UNreal how awful this is - OMG
0439023521|1.0|The book, as well as the movie is well done, BUT-it presents as a fantasy what is real- they describe what we have now!!! with one % or less controlling the wealth. The Occupy movement was not a solution in that it proposed no strategy-<br />Donald Sutherland opines that a future leader will come out of the Occupy Movement?<br /><br />but to me- the movie spokespeople- the director, the \\"stars\\"? the people who made this movie are, unfortunately, liberals- not radicals!<br /><br />The \\"Capital\\" is clearly Washington, DC- with its lobbyists and fat cat politicians. The movie ends on the note that the couple will give the dispossessed Districts \\"hope\\"? No- revolution and struggle would give them hope.<br /><br />The book and movie could have gone further and pointed out how radical movements- like those of civil rights or peace in the 1960's- actually led to read change? But it does not. It has people in District 11 raising their fists in a v signal- but they don't fight back- they don't attack the storm troopers.<br /><br />Juvenile, frivolous- are two words that come to mind- altho I enjoyed watching it as a story- that is not enough.<br /><br />The movie is not that far from the \\"reality tv\\" it supposedly lampoons. It seems to be written by a suburban house wife w limited experience. In life!! It actually ends as if the arranged marriage could be a solution- it does not question. Pathetic!!!<br /><br />Try a couple of documentaries- \\"The Battle of Algiers\\" and \\"Freedom Riders\\". No one has the courage to do a fictional treatment of what needs to be done!
B0055Q5F36|5.0|This case is everything I expected. It protects the phone very well while having easy access to all the buttons and screen. I just wish it had a belt clip as an optional accessory. Other models had a belt clip but, those models were not compatible w/the AT&T version of the phone. I wonder how much the phone version matters for the case, anyway?!?
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I heard an interview with the author on NPR and I thought the book sounded good. To be honest, it was not disappointing and I enjoyed the story. The pace was slow in certain parts, but overall I kept reading to find out how Harold's journey would end. I would recommend this book.
B001JU4S44|2.0|The original Mission Impossible stories used to take one, or on a special occasion, two episodes for special occasions, to tell their story. Dated they may be, but they are streets ahead of this disappointing sequel to the revival that seems to drag out a flimsy story into over two hours. It takes 40 minutes for the story to start properly, and then when it does there is way too much invested in lovey-dovey nonsense. This isn't supposed to be a love story; it's supposed to be an action flick and as such needs to move fast. A few fancy effects yes, but who can't do this there days in movies. Does not deliver.
034580404X|3.0|The first book was intense and entertaining. The second got less so and the third book it was just more of the same two young people with raging hormones having sex twice a day. There was a love story involved.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I lobe this app&iexcl;!!!!!!! it is so much fun and I think u should get it. I love that there r so many different games
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Amazing directing and superb acting The Hunger Games is one of the best movies i've seen this year the DVD itself came earlier than expected so that's a huge + although the special features CD came with a lot of stuff I was disappointed because they didn't include deleted scenes and bloopers
0761169253|4.0|I follow Austin Kleon on Tumblr, and he seems like a cool dude. One day at school I was browsing the bookstore and saw his book.<br /><br />I hesitated to buy it because I knew I could find this kind of information online. (And ten bucks is serious cash when you're in college...) That is certainly true, but it's nice having something tangible; something to hold and mark in. Mr. Kleon has an easygoing voice and his doodles are fun to look at. It's a quick read, but I don't think the value of the book is experienced in one reading session. It's more of reference point, for when you're stuck with something or feeling discouraged. And it's small enough to carry around with you, so you can have it for just such a moment.<br /><br />The idea that good work out there is \\"stolen,\\" is a comforting one for anyone who wants to create something.<br />But with Steal Like an Artist, Kleon goes deeper than the inspiring graphic posts you can find on Tumblr. He goes into the life of someone who's trying to create good work. That is the part most helpful to me. I've heard functional tips about managing your money and time a thousand times before, but Kleon puts in the context of making sure you can dedicate time and resources to being creative. That's the helpful part.<br /><br />If this book were to be re-released, I would suggest a larger \\"creative space.\\" In the back of the book is a page for doodles and a little checklist. I'm thinking little cards or whatever that can be ripped out and stuck somewhere or carried around would be fun. I don't know, Mr. Kleon is a creative guy, I'm sure he'll think of something. :)
030758836X|5.0|Many times I wanted to put this book down, to turn away from it, as it is a very dark and psychological thriller about a \\"psycho b****\\".<br /><br />Gillian Flynn must be a psychologist, a writer, a police officer and a defense lawyer all rolled into one.<br />She manages to create a story articulating extremely toxic people and the influences that our current \\"trial by media\\" have on criminal investigations with a scary thriller in 415 unforgettable pages.<br /><br />This book is a roller coaster ride that does not let you off, even when you've had enough.<br /><br />See for yourself.<br /><br />Amazing Amy and Naughty Nick will live on, I'm sure, in books to come.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Nice graphs, decent gameplay. It does need to be fed with real money though. If you are into such games, it worths it.
B0016OLC5Q|1.0|I hate this movie.  The story is \\"based\\" on a real person but it's almost completely contrived all to make a point an a movie that doesn't know what it's talking about.  Like or hate this movie, just as long as you're not dumb enough to believe it.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie but I ended up very disappointing.  I only found one character interesting was the ship's captain.<br /><br />Visually the movie is beautiful.  The characters are flat and uninteresting.  And the plot was disappointing
B00846F1YW|1.0|Shouldn't have purchased before I finished Mysteryville.  Also should have read the reviews.  Starts off OK.  fun.  Cannot turn off timer.  Then, when I got to &quot;repairing glass&quot; I could go no further...it does seem to be related to not sharing w/Facebook.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|There's been plenty that's already been written about this amazing album. I don't really see a need to add yet another review but I DO want to add my vote that this is indeed the best Rush you've heard in YEARS!<br /><br />We'll all debate endlessly on which was their last great album - believe it or not I love Presto as much as Moving Pictures and Hemispheres - but I'm just glad Rush never hung it up years ago like so many other bands. Otherwise we wouldn't have this masterpiece! I agree with another reviewer that said he didn't know Rush still had it in them. I'm blown away. This is proof of that these guys are immortal.<br /><br />If you're a Rush fan you know better than to judge an album on first listen. Basically if you don't love this album then you simply haven't listened to it enough. :)<br /><br />Rush is back!
B005LAII5I|4.0|In the follow up to The Expendables Sylvester Stallone and company carry on their fun conceit of gathering several recognizable and big star actors mostly from shoot 'em up action fare and return the majority of them to the screen and add a couple of faces to this outing.  Major players in this movie are again Stallone and Statham.  Also getting an ample amount of screen time are returners Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, and Randy Couture, while the (unbelievable) love interest/ sex appeal this time around is Nan Yu, someone who will be new to the majority of moviegoers.  Round 2 avoids cameos, giving a bit more screen time to some of the past film's cameo stars, such as Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzeneggar, and gives the funnest portions to Chuck Norris.  But it also greatly diminishes Jet Li's screen time though he is given one good physically active sequence.  Rounding out the players who get a decent amount of screen time are Liam Hemsworth (who plays the young and alive heart of the team of the Expendables), and villains played by Jean Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins.<br /><br />So anyone who doesn't automatically know what type of movie this is obviously isn't familiar with the typical fare of most of these movie stars.  If any of those persons are reading this review know that this movie is a hyper violent shoot, blow up, knife, and bludgeon people to death movie.  If you can't get past that description then know this movie isn't for you.  For everyone else just know that there is more blood, more spatter, more flying limbs and severed heads than you can shake a stick at.  It's really quite ridiculous and often times laugh-out-loud funny.  Fans will absolutely love the introduction to Chuck Norris' character.  I'll leave it at that.  The movie is paper thin on plot: in order to re-introduce us to the characters we are treated to the group of mercs known as the Expendables as they rescue a couple of guys.  After this rescue mission goes off without a hitch they celebrate but are soon given an assignment that they have no choice of passing up.  You know the type: get the secret information before it falls into the wrong hands.  Well, surprise! surprise!  It falls into the wrong hands.  Someone gets killed and they get stumped.  So they spend the rest of the movie, in the words of Sly's leader Barney Ross toward the bad guys, \\"We're gonna hunt 'em, find 'em, and kill 'em.\\"  You can probably guess the ending.<br /><br />For fans interested in the hand-to-hand side of combat and who fights who there isn't much by way of star-on-star action.  There are several scenes where our bad boys physically beat down any number of unrecognizable bad guys but the main character on character fights are: Statham's Lee Christmas vs. Scott Adkins' Hector and Sly's Barney Ross vs. Van Damage's aptly named Vilain.<br /><br />This movie is far funnier, both intentionally and unintentionally, than the first outing.  There are one-liners being fired off practically as fast as the guns in this film.  Some of the better lines that I remember are: when Arnold wants a big gun he goes for the one that super-buff Terry Crews is holding and Crews tells Arnie, \\"If I don't get this back your a** is terminated.\\"  Dolph Lundgren quips to Randy Couture before setting off an explosion, \\"Better cover your ear.\\"  (Minor spoiler ahead)  When Li is about to exit the group Lundgren, who viciously fought Li in the first movie and constantly harped on his diminutive stature, says, \\"Who am I supposed to pick on now?\\"  Li retorts, \\"You'll find another minority.\\"  In the climactic fight scene Van Damme tells Sly, \\"I'm outta bullets.\\"  Sly scuffs, \\"That's your problem.\\"  And my personal favorite is when Sly tells Norris, \\"I heard that you got bit by a king cobra.\\"  Norris nods his head affirmatively, \\"Yes, but after five days of agonizing pain...the cobra died.\\"  If any of these little scenarios made you smile or laugh then you should have a few more smiles and laughsas you watch the movie.  It might not be worth full fare at the theaters but you'll want to check it out in some way.<br /><br />My final thought is this: there probably won't be an Expendables 3 unless they tap some new blood and make a more serious, and smarter, action flick.  These older stars are fun to watch but the conceit of this film does start to fall flat.  I hate to say this but Arnold looks practically arthritic!  But maybe fans can petition Stallone with some fresh (or at least fun) ideas.  It's worth a try!  Put your ideas in the comment's section below.  Let's see if we can't stir something up.as you watch the movie.

B004SDEP38|1.0|I can't stand this app!!! I call foofarah! If you don't know what it means look it up. For those who say its great its not. You cant type your own documents straight from your kindle, and anything worth while is on the full version.  I am immediately uninstalling this app! :(
B005HJWWW8|1.0|I bought this based on mostly positive reviews I read.  I just got it a couple of days ago.  It works when it is plugged into the usb port and charging but it does not work at all on battery power, i.e. the battery does not work or charge up.  I did attempt to charge the battery for several hours several times and the unit does not work at all on battery power.  I watched YouTube Videos on this unit to make sure I was doing it right.  I haven't seen any other reviews where someone had this problem.  I'm sending it back.
B007H7XJD4|2.0|This is another 300ish film only this time with the theme of greek myths, over the top acting, CGI to the 3rd power, and the been there done that feeling of every movie like this. The movie is cheesy mostly and delivers plenty of action but no story to drawn you into it hardly. It's more like watching cartoon violence, it shallow and over the top but you don't expect much from it because it's a cartoon. That is pretty much what this movie is. Oh well, it gave me something to do. Also it's too long.
B0068VZQCC|2.0|Admiitedly a latecomer to Blind Guardian (Forgotten Tales, Night at the Opera and later), I thought this would be a good way to hear some of their older stuff before buying the full albums.  But if this is their \\"best\\", I'll pass on the rest.  I don't know if its the remixes or re-recordings that may be doing the songs injustice, or if its all the songs sounding the same (muddy, droning...), but this doesn't sound like the band that created Twist in the Myth or At the Edge of Time.  Disappointing.
0345803485|5.0|I just read the whole trilogy within the week and I could NOT for one second put the book down!  Once you get past the whole sex thing it serious opens your eyes.  The relationship that Anastasia and Christian grow into makes you wanting to read more and more.  When I was done reading the last book I was kind of sad that I did not have a fourth book to read.. It left me wanting more which is quite ironic.

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I found myself singing along to Grenade and getting the tune stuck in my head, then my sister gave me this CD for my birthday. I love it. It's full of feel good music. Even with the harsh reality of Grenade (once you really listen to the words), I enjoy the tune and sing along at the top of my lungs. He has such a unique happy sound, I can listen to this CD anytime and start smiling!<br /><br />The Lazy Song is another favorite and of course Just the Way You Are. There really isn't one song I don't like. And all seem to have a happy beat. Even the \\"Our First Time\\" makes me smile. He is a happy romantic singer.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviews that it was disappointing to only have 10 songs.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|Here we go again:  Storytelling 101 - show your audience, don't TELL them.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a painful exercise in incessant exposition.  For an action movie built upon the survival instincts of a young and humble warrior, the majority of the film is spent watching people explain things to the heroine and the audience, almost all of which is totally unnecessary.  You don't really need to know about sponsors, apartments, blue hair or the repetitious \\"Rules of the Game\\" so to speak. It just ends up dragging what is essentially a 80-minute movie nearly an hour longer.  Despite all the talk of myth that inspired the original novel, we've seen it all before in what is unambiguously adapted from the Most Dangerous Game.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence has an honest face which owns every scene, but unfortunately Gary Ross gets it all wrong. Ross cuts to so many arbitrary setups, he seems lost on how to lens and frame this story and by consequence, who to connect with.  You end up not caring who lives or dies in what SHOULD be a story of life and death.  On the dramatic side, we spend more time hearing people jabber on about nonsense than see them act upon anything.  Characters in The Hunger Games seemingly talk AT Katniss, never TO her and it all funnels into unmemorable noise. The empty dialog is shuttled around by lots of unmotivated shaky cam and quick cutting nonsense that doesn't edit.  The movie just doesn't flow well and in the scenes where it finally does - always in action - it is short lived.  At the end of every scene, I was awaiting the commercials because it feels like a hastily produced FOX show for Friday night.<br /><br />I really just wanted to see the young and talented Jennifer Lawrence out in the wild tracking down Arnold Schwarzenegger from the Running Man.  But instead we are held hostage by Gary Ross's witless direction and a dry talky script.  This is a movie with a character but no story, a setup but no payoff. Lots of hunger and very little game.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, you won't regret it.  Watch [[ASIN:B005CMSDKA Hanna [Blu-ray]]] instead.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Raise a loud cheer! Stephen King is back as the king of horror.  No vampires or ghouls necessary here, but the horror of trying to change the past.<br /><br />Imagine being given that choice, and realizing that you have no choice at all. I loved the entire concept he introduced, which was so different from any other.  King has a way of endearing you to his characters, making them feel as if you have known them for years.<br /><br />His main character goes back in time in order to try to change tragedies which took place there. He hopes that if he can stop these tragedies, he can change the future.  One of these tragedies is the murder of JFK. Can he stop these tragedies? If so, what changes will occur? That is the thrill of the novel.<br /><br />You King fans who have read \\"IT\\" will be thrilled with the trip to Derry. You will find some connections between the two books, which was amazingly thrilling.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. I place it up there as one of Kings best!

0345803485|1.0|This book is by far the WORST book i have ever read. the story line does not progress. i hate her references to \\"Fifty Shades of\\"...pretty much everything. She get chills every time he looks at her. they never have a normal flowing conversation. I felt that the more i read this book, the dumber i was becoming. there are sooo many errors, that E L James' editing company should get fired. The weekends seem to be more like the Span of two months as oppose to 2 days. Everything is just terribly wrong. the second book is pretty much like the first...REPETITIVE! they both orgasm every time they say each other's name/ touch each other. i became so annoyed that i told myself that if i come across the words- \\"Fifty shades of F'ed UP, \\"Do you know what i want to do to you right now?\\", \\" my inner goddess\\", \\"care free Christian\\", \\"Twitching Palms\\", AND so many other phrases one more time, I'm not reading the books any further. Im 87% finished Fifty Shades Darker, and i refuse to waste any more of my brain cells.

B007XELMO4|5.0|A bit pricy, but get this product.<br /><br />I got hiking a lot and I've been stopped by about 10 people asking about this strap shot.<br /><br />Really great product that keeps my camera ready to shoot at a moments notice.  Mostly I'm hiking, but I love being able to shoot easily.<br /><br />I like this option versus the hip holster because we often use trekking poles and they frequently hit my camera when it was on my side hip.  It also looks pretty slick with my camera just chillin there.  It has a locking mechanism so I never accidentally comes out, but once I twist the camera it pulls out very easily.

B007KCG7MQ|4.0|I have always liked what Joe has done musically....more so the James Gang and solo stuff. I started listening to The James Gang in high school back in the early 70's because a friends older brother had all the records and we would borrow them to enjoy. It was Joes guitar work that got my attention and the amount of obvious fun they had making those records. While not owning everything he ever did I have kept up with his work over the years....and it has been many years! I was really looking forward to this arriving at my door and I have to say with a HUGE amount of relief that Joe has really done an excellent job on this! I got it later in the afternoon, put it on the POD and the next day I put the CD on in the car on the way to work, listened to it once at work and then after getting home that day as well. It just makes me want to keep listening again and I have to say that is not as often a feeling I do get with any new releases these days as I wish would happen. This effort by Joe in places is full of great guitar playing , heartfelt lyrics and tons of more obvious Joe fun. Love every song on this and really got a kick out of Funk 50...so much guitar in under 2 minutes! The middle section of  Spanish Dancer just begs me to go for a serious turn clockwise of the old volume for sure! I can relate to his views throughout about Family. Love and the Analog thing...and his puzzlement over why we keep ignoring how our behavior will be affecting folks in the future just so we can \\" have stuff \\" now. He's right, a lot of us do have our heads up our asses! Fishbone is a hoot and so is Analog Man. I'm thinking it was a great move to involve Jeff Lynne and Irving Azoff ...the thing sounds really good...I seem to be able to crank it beyond the usual level before things get distorted...fine by me! If you were ever a fan of anything Joe has done get this...you will not be dissapointed. I do have to say that I think this way of packaging CDs now really does suck though...if the thing isn't turned right side up the darn CDs just fall out...stupid concept big time. I learned a long time ago to have the paper or clear slimline jewel cases handy to put the CDs in so I can use 'em in the car and home system and just put aside the original package. That however does not reflect at all from this great recording...buy it!thing isn't turned right side up the darn CDs just fall out...stupid concept big time.

B0064Z62R0|5.0|I had missed this movie when it was in theaters, so a friend and I ordered it on pay-per-view.  The first thing that got me was the music and the main title design.  Then I got so engrossed in the film, the music made the storytelling more authentic.<br /><br />THE DESCENDANTS soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a long time from a movie.  The selections by Gabby Pahunui (whom I heard of) along with a lot of other classic Hawai'ian gems (which I never knew existed) caught my ear and actually took me back when I got off my flight in Honolulu hearing some of it before I left the plane.<br /><br />I love this soundtrack because it not only has heart, it also has soul.  Many times when a compilation soundtrack is put together, you don't get all the music from the movie, especially if there is a score.  THE DESCENDANTS never goes into uncharted territory keeping its' focus on the music of Hawai'i and it plays to score the movie.<br /><br />If this was food, I'd say it's definitely 'ono'!  Wait...it is because there are great delicious tracks here to suit your pallette.  [[ASIN:B005RJ6AIK The Descendants]]

B005LAII5I|4.0|Let's get one thing straight.  You don't go into a movie like [[ASIN:B002ZG99A4 The Expendables ]] without knowing what you are getting yourself into.  If you've seen the first film and enjoyed its larger-than-life salute to big 80's action stars then you know exactly what you should expect from the sequel.  It's more of the same formula: Big on star power machismo, ammunition, and one-liners and simple on plot, exposition and intelligence.  The bottom line is; you don't watch The Expendables expecting any Academy Award winning performances.  If this doesn't sound like kind of movie that you would normally enjoy watching then you came to the wrong party.<br /><br />The Boys are BACK: Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, Terry Crews as Hale Caesar, Randy Couture as Toll Road and Jet Li as Yin Yang while Mickey Rourke is out as Tool but the testosterone meter is still off the charts.  Liam Hemsworth joins the team as the youngest \\"expendable\\" Bill the Kid.  The Expendables have been recruited by Church to stop weapons-grade plutonium hidden in a Albanian mine during the Cold War from falling into the wrong hands and it's time to bring in the Dirtier Dozen.<br /><br />The muscle and all-star power are man-uped the second time around.  There's much more Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis this time who only appeared in smaller cameo roles as Trench and Church in the first film and there's more iconic 80's action stars that the fans have been begging to see like Chuck Norris as Booker a.k.a. the \\"Lone Wolf\\" and Jean Claude Van Damme as Vilain, and what an apropos \\"villain\\" he makes.  It seems Steven Seagal is still the odd man out due to a publicized disagreement with the producer Avi Lerner, although when asked if he would be in Expendables 3 his response was \\"We'll see.\\"  Rumor has it that Clint Eastwood and Harrison Ford have already been approached for the third one as well with plans to acquire Nicholas Cage and Wesley Snipes to the Expendables 3 dossier.<br /><br />Expendables 2 is a blast if you can appreciate it for what it is; it's the guiltiest kind of guilty pleasure and it makes no apologies for being what it is.  The first one feels almost like a dress rehearsal but the sequel is bigger and a lot more fun.  There are hilarious one-liners and bad puns aplenty and the chemistry between these legendary screen icons takes badassery to a whole new cinematic level.  The epic showdown between \\"The Italian Stallion\\" Stallone and the \\"Muscles From Brussels\\" Van Damme makes it worth the price of admission alone.<br /><br />Bring on Expendables 3!

B000IZ8SD8|1.0|I am amazed at the sheer number of positive reviews of this movie. I do not know if it is due to the sacred cow nature of the Star Treks series or if anybody truly watched this movie. Many reviewers have noted or nipped around the periphery of the films many flaws, but few have noted the most egregious errors therein.<br /><br />In the beginning, the Enterprise is essentially exiled to the romulan zone since Picard has a borg history and he is seen as a wild card or something. While being something like 8000 light years from Earth, the crew is listening to the battle real time. Fine, maybe Starfleet has transwarp communication. Not a problem. However, after some soul searching and debate, the crew decides they need to leave their post and save Earth. Within 5 seconds, the Enterprise is in the midst of the battle having traveled an impossible distance in the blink of an eye??? Picard then miraculously knows precisely where to hit the cube (maybe he should have shared this knowledge with the rest of the fleet?) and the Borg are defeated. Everybody cheers, yay.<br /><br />Onto the obligatory time travel (if the Borg had the ability, why not just use it in the first place with a full cube?), the Borg enter past Earth with the Enterprise in hot pursuit. Of course the sphere is destroyed, and all seems okay until the internal sensors fail to note intruders on board and the borg start to modify the interior of the Enterprise. Fine. However, the idea that the Borg will be nice if you don't poke them with a stick is absurd. There are like 5 of them against a crew of 400 and an entire planet eventually. You would think getting numbers would be one of their main priorities, but no they play nice as long as you don't irritate them.<br /><br />There are too many other idiotic scenes and ideas like these in the movie to list them all. Suspension of belief is one thing, but when it gets insulting, that is something completely different.<br /><br />Final comment is regarding the Moby Dick analogy. There is no comparison, your ship and world are under attack, Picard is on the defensive at this point. Ahab went looking for his destruction, Picard had it come directly to him and he acted appropriately. One star may seem a little harsh, but this movie was that bad.
B008XG1X18|1.0|It is pointless because when you repin something, the app guesses which board you want it in. So I would then have to log in the regular website to organize the pins I added from this app. There was another Pinterest app that I think was made by a third party but it was 99 cents and it works better than this official Pinterest version so I guess I will just keep using that one until this one fixes the problem of not being able to chooses which board I'm pinning to. How stupid is that?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the Powerful Word at my fingertips. thanks for the great seeing and daily reminders to read.  the worlds most popular book is still changing lives.
055358894X|5.0|This was my second time reading this book, and I promised myself I'd write a real review of it this time. I loved it the first time I read through it. I still enjoyed it a great deal the second time, although perhaps a little bit less, because the surprises in it lose a bit when you can see them coming. That's one of the things that was so great about it. It was full of real surprises that I couldn't predict. Usually, in most fantasy books, I can predict the supposed surprising twists and turns of the story, with very few exceptions.<br /><br />The characters this book is about are not good people. They're thieves and con artists, operating in a ruthless city filled with corruption. I fell in love with Locke Lamora as I read it.  He is the epitome of the anti-hero. I enjoy him, because although he is a bastard, he yet does have a code.  Hence the Gentleman Bastards. Despite the way he screws people over, he actually does care about the little guy. And his friends are more dear to him than anything in the world. This is the sort of character I can enjoy. He's also smart. While it's great fun to watch him outwit his enemies, it's also perhaps even more fun to watch him screw everything up and have his plans blow up in his face. Make no mistake. Locke Lamora is not a Mary Sue who can never fail. He is smart but fallible, which becomes apparent if you manage to make it past the first third of the book, which is spent demonstrating to the audience how awesome he is.<br /><br />I could say a few more things, that I loved, and perhaps a few things that could have been better. (Perhaps 4.5 stars is what I'd really give this.) But they are things that would really ruin the book for you, and as I said in the beginning, it becomes a bit less enjoyable if you see the surprises coming.t less enjoyable if you see the surprises coming.

B007SGM084|5.0|I love this trilogy!  It was a great love story.  Yes, it had a lot of sex, but it was really about two people falling in love despite their imperfections.  I could hardly put the book(s) down and was sad to see it end.  I will read it again in the future as well as anything else this author publishes.<br /><br />People who gave this trilogy a poor rating for immaturity are off base.  These book are written from the perspective of a 22 year old woman and a 28 year old man.  The author nailed it.  If you're looking for a book about a mature relationship between middle aged folks you should read Danielle Steele.  The thoughts and plights of the main characters are dead on for the ages they represent.<br /><br />People who gave this trilogy a poor rating due to the price on Amazon should have their reviews taken away.  You are in the wrong forum if you want to complain about pricing.  This is about the book not about your obviously ignorant choice of purchasing (with full knowledge of the price) & then complaining after the fact!<br /><br />People who gave this trilogy a poor rating due to \\"pornographic content\\"......HELLO!  Did you just come out of a dark closet?  Everyone knows this book is labeled \\"erotica\\" so there should be no surprise that there is graphic sex!  Which by the way was so freaking hot!  If sex is not your cup of tea, then don't read it.  Do you feel compelled to eat everything at a buffet?  Do you scream because it is on the table with the stuff you do want to eat?  Your complaints are groundless.<br /><br />I highly recommend this trilogy if you like romance and are not offended by sex.  Happy reading! :-)
0802473156|5.0|The 5 Love Languages is helpful to anyone interested in a committed relationship. This book will teach you how to communicate effectively with your partner. In most relationships what we consider loving or as being considerate may not be seen the same way for the other person. What we consider as important may not mean as much to our spouse. We have to learn what's important to them and capatalize on those things.<br /><br />The 5 languages are words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts,  quality time and physical touch.  Each person has their own preference of things that are important to them. Words of affirmation is basically complimenting your spouse and letting them know what they mean to you. Taking the time to tell your spouse what they mean to your life. Acts of service refers to being available to your spouse and helping them through random acts. Receiving gifts does not have to be a big expensive gift but instead a small gesture that says you were thinking about them. Quality time is making opportunities to spend with your spouse. Physical touch can be hugging, kissing, or hand holding.<br /><br />Learning which one of these is important to your spouse will help your relationship tremendously. I have tried implementing this information and I must say it really helped.

B004SIP8SY|4.0|Apologies to those who are only interested in book report summaries of the plot and judgements on the acting. I'm not that guy and you can find storyboard summaries in probably most of the other reviews.  I am only focused on the quality of the DVD transfer to Blu Ray.<br /><br />I have both volumes on Standard Def DVDs and have recently bought the Blu Ray versions.  As with vol 1, there is little difference between the Standard Def versions and Blu Ray transfers.  The audio on the Standard version is a highly recommended DTS 5.1.  That's no slouch in the audio dept.  However, the Blu Ray version is  lossless PCM audio, which, with proper audio editing can make a big difference.  Unfortunately, not with this transfer.  The front sound stage is very nicely used with a beautiful spread of the instrumentation of the score across the stage.  The rear channels are rarely used which is sad.<br /><br />While the video transfer on Blu Ray is better than it was for Vol 1, there is still some grain noticeable.  This is especially so when Bill drops off Uma at Mei Pei's retreat.  You can see the grain in the cement and a close up of Mei Pei's hair from the rear is soft and unfocused.  Perhaps this was deliberate, I don't know.  The improvement over Vol 1 is noticeable in the color saturation which is not as muted as with the blu ray version of Vol 1.<br /><br />I enjoy both these films from time to time and think they are great movies.  However, to update your standard def version to blu ray will have limited rewards if your expectations of greater quality need to be met.  The extras are the exact same as with the standard def versions; a making of, trailers and one deleted scene.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|These books will never be classics but they kept me entertained for a few days.<br /><br />I found some of the characters well rounded and developed. Unfortunately the main female character was hard to like. She was too fickle and never seemed to be able to get past herself to really see the people around her.
B00770KR7W|5.0|As soon as I saw this figure was out, I knew I wanted to get one, and it's now my favorite figure out of my whole collection. The figure has a solid feel to it and seems like the arms have more joints in them, giving the figure more options when it comes to posing. My only problem with the figure, is the fact that the legs seem like they have fewer joints, which restricts the movement just a tad.<br />Another small note: This Chief Figure is like, 1/8 to a 1/4 of a inch shorter than the other Master chiefs figure (I have the Halo 1,2 and 3 figures) but this makes him feel like he's more to scale with the Marine figures.<br />Overall, I think it's great figure, and any die-hard Halo fan will enjoy having this figure.

B001AQR3IU|5.0|I first want to thank Neil Gaiman for all he has done for fiction and Fantasy genre. Secondly thank the positive reviews of this film that inspired me to rent this movie. I'm buying it as we speak. This movie is an instant classic. great blend of action humor, wonderment and heart. Excellent acting by every cast member. Great special effects that don't look cheesy at all. Buy this movie and share it with your loved ones.

0385344228|5.0|Another book written by a lawyer turned writer, right? Not at all! Our dynamic protagonist provides us a unique and unabashed look at our legal prosecution system. Although the main question looming is: What would you do if you thought your child was a murderer? But besides all of that... just when you think the story is winding down - WOW!

B006LSZECO|3.0|I was really curious about this book in the beginning I was hoping the story would pick up. But then there was a turn in the storyline which was a turn for the worse.  I felt the storyline really started to slow down at this point. By the end it was at a screeching halt. I can see how some people might like this book. If you like unconventional stories then this might be for you. One of the major problems for me was I did not like the main characters. There was no one for me to care about. The best part of the book was the way the story was presented. One chapter from Nick's point of view then one chapter from Amy's point of view. This was a fresh presentation, plus the story was original even if it wasn't my favorite and for this reason I give it three stars.
0891419063|5.0|My mother and aunts and uncles lived though the experience of WWII and shared stories of the loved ones they lost then. This has fostered my intense interest in the war over the past 25 or so years. I find that Sledge's book is probably the best at describing the extreme range of emotions experienced by veterans of that war, particularly the foot solders.<br />I have had the privilege of talking with many veterans of WWII (many of whom are now departed), and while they spoke freely of their experiences, they usually tended to stay away from discussing their own trials. They focused on the highlights of their campaigns, comedic events, and their fallen brothers (who they universally consider heroes).<br />I think \\"With The Old Breed\\" provides an insight to the part of war that all these veterans felt reticent to share.<br />Again, \\"With the Old Breed\\" is not a dashing story, but it spills out the human emotions of the infantryman as well as any I have read.

0062206281|3.0|This is the third piece of a four book series that definitely isn't in a true linear fashion.  I'd read the first book (The Shadow of the Wind) but not the second (a prequel, The Angel's Game).  PoH occurs after Shadow but much of it tells a story that I think connects the plots and people of the to prior books and lets them overlap.  I may reference things that would be a spoiler to Shadow...I might for Angel's but can't know...so that's the best warning I can give.<br /><br />Daniel works in his father's bookshop.  He and his wife, Bea, live upstairs with their baby boy.  Fermin works in the store and has a much deeper relationship making him close to family (though more of how that came to be is in this book).  A man comes and buys a pricey book and asks Daniel to take it, with an inscription, to Fermin.  The eventually leads Fermin to share the story of his time in prision (in an era with a \\"thought police\\" piece of the culture).  He meets folks there and we also see how he gets from the prison to the time he met Daniel.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed Shadow....I gave it 4 stars but didn't write any details.  I think it was kinda an easy one to \\"grab\\" me since a big feature is a huge, hidden library called the Cemetary of Forgotten Books.  The book he picks motivates much of his role in the book.  There's also a lot of intrigue and mystery about motives and connections...I didn't DISLIKE that, but it wasn't the draw.<br /><br />This book is good.  It is a lot about how we become who we are with a prision holding some innocent folks, some thinkers/writers, and some who just plain did the crime.  There's a lot of questions of love and loyalty in there.  The past story, and remedying a situation it created, is crucial to moving Fermin ahead in his life and starting his marriage.<br /><br />But, still, it didn't truly grab me.  Not sure if I'd have read it w/o the Shadow experience (and know idea how it might have mattered if I read Angel's).  Taking it as its own book...3 stars.  It is intriguing with a push on the role of gov't and intellectualism.  I do like that stuff, but it really never captured me fully

B005LAII62|5.0|\\"Coraline\\" was amazing. Even though its box office success wasn't nearly as impressive as it should have been and you rarely hear anyone bring it up whenever conversations turn to animated films, \\"Coraline\\" catered to both children and adults. It had this extremely dark undertone; children were having their eyes replaced with buttons. That's so gloriously morbid for a children's flick. There was also mild cursing, a creepy alternate world where everyone had a mirror self (with button eyes, of course), and a woman with a massive chest that was only covered by sea shells in one particular scene. It was just so unusual and extraordinary. Laika Entertainment, the studio behind \\"Coraline,\\" has brought us \\"ParaNorman,\\" which is certainly in the same vein and travels a similar path to greatness.<br /><br />\\"ParaNorman\\" is a stop-motion animated film that revolves around Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee); a young boy who can talk to dead people and is ridiculed because of it. Even his family doesn't believe in his gift, especially his dad Perry (Jeff Garlin) who refuses to think outside the box and gets angry at things he doesn't understand. Norman is picked on everyday by a thick-headed bully named Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and is mostly a loner until he gets to know a red headed boy named Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) who is bullied just as much as Norman but has learned to turn the other cheek.<br /><br />A strange man named Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman) claims to share Norman's gift and under a strange set of circumstances passes the duty of keeping the witch's curse at bay for another year to Norman. Now in a race against time, Norman finds himself with a group of unlikely allies including Neil's meathead brother Mitch (Casey Affleck) and Norman's ditzy sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick) as he tries to save the town from uncertain doom and a zombie takeover.<br /><br />\\"ParaNorman\\" treads a thin line between something that's appropriate for the whole family and only being suitable for a teenage or more mature audience, but if you didn't have a problem with the content in \\"Rango\\" or \\"Coraline\\" then it shouldn't be much of a problem here. The word \\"hell\\" is used more than once and Norman's grandma calls Perry a \\"jackass\\" at one point. It hints at more mature themes, as well. Perry calls Norman's gift \\"limp wristed hippy garbage\\" and a certain male character mentions having a boyfriend late in the film. Norman's sister Courtney is very gifted in the posterior region and there are many jokes that make use of that or could be considered innuendo. It's kind of glorious, really. Fans of animation will be in heaven.<br /><br />There's obviously a big horror influence, as well; particularly classic zombie films, \\"Halloween,\\" and \\"Friday the 13th.\\" So the film not only caters to animation fans, but also horror hounds. There are a ton of throwbacks, jokes about brains, and zombies with flesh hanging from their decayed bones. The imagery is just as exceptional; intimidating houses, gloomy forests, and a heavy use of shadows and lack of lighting. \\"ParaNorman\\" is just the right amount of homage, humor, and animation.<br /><br />\\"ParaNorman\\" isn't quite as original or as dark as \\"Coraline,\\" but it's still extremely entertaining for most ages and one of the best animated films of the year. The emphasis on witchcraft results in a rather peculiar final act, but is still very enjoyable. \\"ParaNorman\\" is brilliantly animated with an amazing cast and clever writing. It's the animated film horror fans have been waiting for and the one \\"Frankenweenie\\" is probably aiming to be.<br /><br />There's a brief scene after the credits that's really interesting; you see how the model for Norman was made along with how much detail goes into a stop-motion animated picture.eing suitable for a teenage or more mature audience, but if you didn't have a problem with the content in \\"Rango\\" or \\"Coraline\\" then it shouldn't be much of a problem here.

B004H4XI5O|5.0|It all comes back to me now. And comes back to my students...which is what I really wanted. Medical Terminology is made much easier for them using techniques found in this narrative. OK, flash cards work, but this author introduces how the great Roman orators like Cicero could give hours of speeches without a notecard. Memory championships would make a great Olympic event (After all, it started in ancient Greece and Rome.)

The writing is not the best, but it's about the story line! Sex story to love story!

B003X27L9U|4.0|A harrowing read, at least for the first half of the novel. It is written from the point of view of a 5 year old boy, Jack, who had never known that there was a real world outside the room he shares with his mother. Donoghue manages the difficult task of revealing the unusual circumstances mother and child are in while capturing the innocence of his view of his self-contained little universe, which makes the narrative even more poignant. It is to the author's credit that she is able to sustain the narrative throughout the novel when the curve of the story dips visibly in the second half. Difficult to say more without revealing spoilers, but it is safe to say that Jack's voice (along with that of Harper Lee's heroine, Scout, in To Kill a Mockingbird) haunts me even after the last page is turned.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Ok, self admitted Rush fan-boy here. Things got a little sideways with Grace Under Pressure, still had the magic but it was a little obscured...I got it, some didn't. I still stood by the guys. Thick and thin, they were still Gods among Gods and forever did I pledge my allegiance. Counter Parts hurt...Presto was quite divergent as was Hold Your Fire. Roll The Bones had a measure of magic to it but still...Test For Echo was a bit better and then Vapor Trails just screamed redemption (except for all those great guitar solos...Exactly)<br /><br />Having been to every concert since GUP, the proceeding releases were of slight consequence...With their long standing catalog; did a few misses really matter? Not really, they still brought the place down every night.<br /><br />I held off buying Snakes and Arrows as I did not want to be disappointed...Went to the concert and didn't quite get those songs. After nearly a year, I gave in and got it. I admit, it took a while and I was able to get about 4 good songs out of it...I should say great songs, not in any way saying the others were \\"bad\\".<br /><br />Enter Clock Work Angels...I went into it skeptically, hoping for a song or two. What came next just blew my mind. I popped in the CD and proceeded to drive to work. I figure this would be good use of my 40-50 minute traffic sitting session. Never before have I experienced what I did...By the time I made it to the middle of \\"Head Long Flight\\" I was in a total frenzy! You know when you're at a live show and about half way into it your favorite song comes on and everything around you just fades away and you are just absolutely swept away in rapture and existing on a primal level with the music? That whole ego-loss primitive part of brain thing? Well yeah, I was there. I couldn't believe it! I couldn't believe what I was hearing or what I was feeling. Never do I do this cause I think its lame...But I actually had to play that song over again, needed to feel that \\"rush\\" (pun intended) one more time. And yes, the Bastille Day reference was not lost...ah, to be a fly on the wall for that one! LOL!!!<br /><br />This album takes a palate of emotions and mixes them into obscure shades that I really haven't felt before or can really explain. The true meaning of art is the ability for the artist to illicit an emotional response and the degree of response defines the degree of success and talent. In that regards, they succeeded immensely.<br /><br />The main thing that stands out with this effort is they took BIG chances and it paid off massively. The new sonic direction that they took is just freakin great. No other Rush album even sounds close to this one.<br /><br />What more can I say...My ears are ringing right now as I just wrapped up yet another listen. Is it all great?...Almost. There's a couple of tracks that are \\"less\\" than the others but the bulk of it is just pure Rush bliss.<br /><br />I just wish their tour manager had more confidence in the guys and booked bigger venues so tickets weren't $300 a pop....That's a bit ridiculous...But I'm going.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|My husband bought this book for me and I thought he was trying to hint at a kinkier sex life. I was a little worried about what I would read and didn't want to have permanent images of sex acts that I would A. find revolting B. wonder if that's what my husband wants me to do. It ended up being a little on the tween side and much tamer than anticipated. The love story itself could have been pulled from any of the classics for which the main character refers, complete with the desire for the female character to change the evil ways of the male love interest. The sex scenes, while different than what I've read elsewhere, descriptively were repetitive. I, being a middle-aged mother with a full-time career, found the dynamic of the relationship to be that of high school love birds; I couldn't identify with the characters except to look back at my younger days. I give the book credit for making me nostalgic for the intensity of falling in love, and for making me want to try to revive that emotion in my six-year marriage.

B006G3MZRQ|1.0|ALL the elements for a great tragedy are present in Warrior: fratricide, credit/bank peonage (i.e. bailout), abandonment of the brothers by choice and through illness as children, PTSD, veterans and their widows left to dry by their government&society ectcetera . . . the litany of plot elements that were nailed-true combined with the performances of the principle actors makes the moral failure of this movie that much more devastating and incomprehensible.<br /><br />That said, there doesn't ever need to be another MMA movie, the acting was so strong in this one; I wanted to love it, but it was sabotaged in various places and became a Stallone-ish meatheaded, moralistic travesty with a unbelievably reactionary conclusion.<br /><br />(spoilers follow) Plot typology of principle characters<br /><br />The unknown quantity (Tom Hardy) turns out to be a war hero, whose medal of honor feat of physicality becomes a viral video, leading to the realization that he was in the process of going AWOL after a friendly fire bombing run blew away his entire unit, him being the sole exception. He will be taken into custody after the conclusion of the tournament and court marshaled.<br /><br />Universal nice guy (Joel Edgerton) has refinanced his mortgage twice (daughter's heart condition) and is facing bankruptcy or foreclosure. In his youth, rather than move with his kid brother and ailing mother and assume a George Baily man of the house role (It's a Wonderful Life), he remains in-town to: 1.) get training from his father denied to him when Hardy's character was around 2.) marry his high school sweetheart. Turning the corner at 30, the has-been all around failure returns to MMA to make ends meet, subsequently losing his position as a highschool physics teacher; he is a New England Walter White of Breaking Bad minus 15 years, in his own way.<br /><br />Deadbeat absentee alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) has cleaned up with AA and finds younger son on his porch. His overtures at reconciliation vacillate between hopelessly self-pitying and pathetic, and vicious ambition.<br /><br />-- -- --<br /><br />Review and Analysis by principle characters<br /><br />Hardy's darkness, the war, is completely glossed over. From his first take down of Mad Dog Grimes in the gym sparring match onwards, it had to be clear that he does not care if he kills his opponents in the ring and that that is perhaps what he aims for. Hardy represents the socioeconomic/moral blowback of the other two's actions as well as those of society (the war, the banking shenanigans). The film ends with a fraternal reconciliation offered as a memory hole cover for predatory housing loans, bailouts, war, desertion charges and personal betrayal.<br /><br />The financial compulsion/desperation of Edgerton is not felt acutely enough; the foolish vanity of not declaring bankrupcy is not utilized/explored nor the strain on the marriage made manifest by it. His idolization by his students also marks him for an Icarus-fall with them as witnesses. Edgerton's character is not a credible master tactician cum Rocky, who overcomes his physical disadvantages by biding his time. The triumph of Edgerton's huberis is the principle dramatic and moral failure of the film.<br /><br />Nolte's character has the least flawed writing and the only fully developed character in the film. The Nolte-Hardy dialectic is masterful and correctly done (he HAS to relapse, and does Hardy holds the mirror up to him), but the Nolte-Edgerton relationship was not maintained by his resentment against his father for not being the favorite son as much as was required; \\"I've forgiven you Dad, -but I don't trust you.\\" As Hardy notes on the beach of the Sparta event, \\"You're full of s*** man, I feel sorry for you.\\" Edgerton -the sensitive reflective guy- has the biggest chip on his shoulder of the three with the most to prove and never realizes it.<br /><br />The gains of having Edgerton's character come out on top (the son most like his mother gives the alcoholic father's favorite son a beat down and the father as well by proxy) are so grossly outweighed by other plot dimensions/possibilities that their merits are not worthy of enumeration here. Edgerton represents the American Dream as is currently understood today. His victory in the film serves the maintenance of this set of lies: Warrior is a propaganda film.<br /><br />\\"I didn't even get to say goodbye to her, my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me.\\" -Actually, Conan O'brien look-alike, you surrendered that right in order to chase after you Dad's approval and to become a teenage dad which put you in the economic hole you're in now; you chose your father over your dying mother and kid brother.<br /><br />\\"My brother was in the Core.\\"<br /><br />Amen.is mother gives the alcoholic father's favorite son a beat down and the father as well by proxy) are so grossly outweighed by other plot dimensions/possibilities that their merits are not worthy of enumeration here.

0156027321|5.0|This work is a serious fantasy adventure with a comic dimension, which at once endears the protagonist, Pi Patel to the reader. Loads of profound truth has been conveyed by the author using the allegory of a castaway who finds himself in a hopeless situation, but who eventually fights his way out of the dire situation that he finds himself in. Comic situations abound in the novel, but as always, profound ruminations of the author are hidden below the stated facts and hence it is up to the reader to draw his own conclusions and enjoy the work. This is one work where the reader will be able to discover new insights each time he reads the book afresh.<br /> The storyline is quite quaint and out of the world. However, in spite of the heavy use of fantasy in the novel, at no point in time would the reader find that the story is not plausible. It has a touch of realism to it throughout the narrative.<br /> The quaintly named boy, Pi is the main protagonist of the novel. Along with him, the novel features a Royal Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker as one of the main characters. Pi is incidentally named after a swimming pool in Paris!!! His full name is Piscine Molitor Patel, and which subsequently gets abbreviated to Pi Patel in school, mainly to avert the predicament of being addressed as \\"Pissing Patel\\" by his teachers and friends at school. The author seems to want to convey a lot through the name that he has selected for his main protagonist. Pi is a never ending number and this has a lot of parallels with the character of Pi.<br /> Pi and his family consisting of his parents and an elder brother, Ravi resides in Pondicherry. The family has a zoo in which they have a lot of exotic animals. The observations of the protagonist  about the behaviour and character of the various animals in the zoo is really enthralling and is a deep study on the psychology of animals. In addition, the other interest of Pi is philosophy and religion, and he is a confirmed believer in God. Heis born a Hindu, but at the same time he is attracted to the tenets of both Islam and Christianity and wants to practice all the three religions at the same time. He says that it does not matter what religion one follows, but what matters is the love that one has for God.<br /> Following the political uncertainty that arises in India, on account of imposition of Emergency by Mrs Indira Gandhi,  Pi's father decides to shift to Canada, much against the wishes of the children and their mother. They are able to sell some of the animals that they have in the zoo, but a vast majority of them are planned to be taken to Canada by sea, with the family accompanying the animals in a rickety Japanese cargo ship called the Tsimtsum. The family themselves take care of the animals in the ship since the crew are of no help to them whatsoever. Moreover, Pi observes that the crew are non communicative as ever and the officers do not interact with the travellers and their motley cargo of animals. All goes well, till such time the ship is caught in a storm and capsizes. Pi, more out of chance than luck manages to escape the foundering ship in a life boat.<br /> There is no sign of his family having escaped the sinking ship. However, he finds that he has the company of a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Royal Bengal tiger on the life boat. Initially the boy discovers only the zebra, the hyena and the orangutan, while the tiger remains hidden under a tarpaulin in the life boat. The boy is terrified of the hyena which is in an aggressive mood, more so on account of the hunger. The hyena attacks the zebra which is already incapacitated on account of a broken leg that it has sustained while fleeing the sinking ship. The gory way in which the hyena finishes off the injured zebra has been portrayed dramatically. Pi has to live through the horror of watching this happen, all the while having to face the difficult situation of being a castaway in the company of dangerous wild animals. The orangutan subsequently gathers some courage and tries to take on the dangerous hyena. However, the poor animal is no match to the devious ways of the hyena and eventually succumbs to the injuries sustained during a fight between the two. Pi becomes all the more scared at being alone with the hyena and waits patiently for the inevitable attack from the animal.<br /> It is at this juncture that there is the startling discovery that there is a wild Royal Bengal tiger on the boat. Pi is mortified. However, the tiger finishes off the hyena and the boy has to now face the dangers of the wild beast and the wild ocean and the solitude and despair that come with being a castaway.<br /> The novel then describes the way in which Pi fashions a raft out of life jackets available on the boat, and as to how he remains tethered to the life boat on the raft so that he is able to maintain a healthy distance from the wild animal. Having a keen insight into animal psychology, he manages to convey to Richard Parker as to who is the boss in the scheme of things. This he manages with a small whistle, with which he is able to train the tiger and establish a definite territory for each of them on the small life boat. He survives the ordeal on the life boat with the help of survival rations already stored on the craft. Once the stores deplete the boy learns to survive off the sea by fishing, and feasting of varied fare like turtles, sharks and dolphins. However, he always pays attention to keep the tiger fed with a share of whatever food he manages to garner, knowing full well that he himself would become the prey in case the tiger becomes too much hungry.<br /> During the course of their adventure the duo land upon an incredible island made up of carnivorous algae that float on the sea in a huge mass. The floating island is populated by meerkats. However, when the boy gets to know of the carnivorous nature of the algae mass he is forced to beat a hasty retreat and get back on to his life boat, and his joy of having discovered something akin to land, after being so long at sea is short lived.<br /> Eventually at the end of 227 days being at sea with a wild tiger, the boy manages to reach land in Mexico. As soon as they land on terra firma the tiger manages to flee into a nearby forest and Pi feels a sense of loss. He knows that it was the companionship of the tiger that kept him alive all through the arduous time that he spent at sea, even though the danger of being eaten alive at any moment was real.<br /> The boy is then interviewed by authorities from Japan, who are investigating the missing Japanese cargo ship. The team, as expected do not believe the account of the tiger and the boy being on the life boat together, and the story about the carnivorous island. In a bid to make his arduous trip sound more plausible, the boy finally narrates his account by substituting an injured young sailor for the injured zebra, his mother for the orangutan, a wily cannibalistic cook for the hyena and he himself for Richard Parker. This probably satisfies the investigators.<br /> The author Yann Martel is a Canadian and he uses a back drop of India to narrate the story. The story is all about the enduring spirit of a young boy to survive against all odds. The implicit faith the child has on God to deliver him from his ordeal is really poignant. The way in which the author has portrayed the solitude and despair experienced by the young boy, while he is at the mercy of the elements on the oceans, in the company of a deadly carnivorous animal is really touching. It is a book that I would classify as \\"a must read\\" and one which would warrant a second reading to help you delve into all the profound meanings that the author aspires to convey to the reader.

B00846REIS|5.0|I read the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy first and enjoyed it but felt it was overrated. I was very impressed with Bared to You, it was so well written and yes it does have ALOT of similarities but I certainly wouldn't say its 50 Shades rewritten. I am very surprised by the negative reviews, I would honestly rate Bared to You higher than 50 Shades.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Not sure if it's the fact that the dragons see always moving or it's poorly optimized, but it made my Droid 3 heat up and run very slowly. Even when the game was closed, it caused slowdowns and crashes in other apps.<br /><br />The dragons are cute but some are odd. It could be the art style. The decorating aspect is very limited, since there is a small number of decorative items. There are no mini games, just feeding, breeding, clearing land and building resource buildings like farms and dragon living areas. Got a bit boring after a day our two.<br /><br />If you want a better game of this type, try Smurfs' Village. Lots more to do and it won't make your device crawl.

Great for Kindle Fire &amp; Any other capable devices :)
B006WAIV6M|4.0|Very easy to read book about what makes us change. Recognizing the cues (why are we doing certain things in certain conditions) is the most difficult part of changing. Found the personal stories quite moving. The corporate aspect was also quite disturbing. The social aspect was more difficult to understand (the civil right movement). All in all insightful and inspiring.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wasn't sure I wanted or was going to read this book(s).  I hadn't heard anything about them and what I had read was not my type of book.  I'm usually focused on space and beyond, something like good ole Buzz Lightyear!  Still, I bought the Wool Omnibus Edition and started reading.  Oh, yeah, I read my books on my Nexus 7 using the Kindle app.  Works just great and I find the Nexus 7 much lighter and easy to manage than the Kindle Fire (which I do own). [Sorry Amazon]<br /><br />Back to the book.  As I'm usually focused on outer space, this book pointed me in the opposite direction.  I had a little period of time visualizing the story setting...again, I'm not used to being in enclosed spaces and in fact I hate them.  But here we are in the gigantic (such a small word) underground silo!  If you haven't read the books yet, might want to stop reading this now.  I finally got the concept and was getting real familiar with the initial key figures when they all get killed off.  That happened pretty quick.  Now comes the hero of the day or should I say heroine!  I guess I'm a male chauvinist because I just don't usually care for female heroines. As females goes, she goes pretty good even though she seems to get deeper in trouble with everything she does.  Fortunately, as a mechanic and a very intelligent one, Juliette can either figure things out or take a wrench to it and gets the job done.  I like her attitude.  She carries off the story line very well.  You seem to have the feeling that she's going to get the job done some how, even when it appears she might go to her death.<br /><br />I like the story because it was written in plain English with very few grammatical errors as far as I could tell. I didn't find any stupid phrasing or paragraphs that didn't fit.  That's very refreshing for an Amazon Kindle book, believe me.<br /><br />Lastly, here's the confusing part, as I read the story, I was constantly asking myself, where were the damn elevators?  All this mechanical and electrical energy plus a few geniuses here and there and these people are killing themselves going up and down 144 levels or is it 148, I lost track?  That's ain't normal nor is it right!  Maybe this next book explains this.  I sure hope so.and electrical energy plus a few geniuses here and there and these people are killing themselves going up and down 144 levels or is it 148, I lost track?

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|While this movie has mixed reviews, and a few significant flaws (an absurd presumption that a ticking bomb won't go off immediately, the worst), nevertheless, I found it near thoroughly delightful all the same.<br /><br />I'd've probably given it four stars but for the savaging \\"Hate it\\" reviews of people ranting that it's not the old Holmes; it's not the real Doyle, blah blah.  Fine.  Be that as it may---let it be called Holmes inspired---IT'S A BLAST TO WATCH.  I watched it twice in one day.  I love that there's a bunch of things that can be picked up on second or third viewings, yet the initial watchings don't, for me, suffer from this.  It just makes later viewings more fun.  OK, so I'm no Sherlock; it took the second viewing for the bomb thing to really bother me; still I had great fun watching it both times---and will buy a copy soon to go with the earlier movie. (I never buy movies I don't LOVE).<br /><br />I tend to be very picky about movies.  Still, I can love movies even if there's a blatant flaw--or even several--so long as it's smart, richly produced and takes me away without making me feel the cameras are just out of view--if you know what I mean.<br /><br />I confess:  I LOVE IT.  IT WAS GREAT FUN AND EXTRAVAGANTLY PRODUCED, FINELY ACTED.  Hope you like it too.  JUST LIGHTEN UP AND LET IT TAKE YOU FOR THE RIDE!!<br /><br />(Being jaded and too snobby with expectations is like viewing through a darkened lens; ya miss too much that is delightful!!!)
1439102813|5.0|While it's not a \\"warm fuzzy\\", as a 50+ year old woman, I thought this was a gripping, albeit somewhat scary, book to read (I did start to think I had all the symptoms for a little while). Alice is a 50 year old Harvard Professor who develops early onset Alzheimer's and the book shows how she and different members of her family and friends and coworkers deal with it. It was very well written and I absolutely recommend reading it. It is written in a way that is not at all morbid but realistic.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|They say this is not a true story but it sure reads like one. The Title character, Jacob is a teenage boy whose father is an assistant district attorney in Newton, MA.<br /><br />Unbeknown to Jacob, his grandfather and great grandfather were both criminals, murders -though his father has none of these characteristics. He works hard 's mom, a school teacher in Jacob's school.<br />Everyone is thrown for a loop when Jacob is accused of murdering a fellow student. See what the family goes through and what they do to try to defend their only child from this accusation.  This book will leave you thinking about lots of things. Read it!
B004XKVPG6|5.0|I really like what they did with this one. A stellar transfer with above average bitrate in the high twenties a lot of the time. The picture has been toned and looks really good, much better than it ever has. Color timing could be a shade different and it is dark but this film now looks glorious, better than I had seen in theaters. Every little detail is defined. The sets are amazing! You really just need to watch this film for the art direction and direction by Fincher in general. People are at the top of their game here on ALL accounts.
B008602KQI|5.0|It didn't follow the book exactly but the end result is a very good movie.  I highly recommend reading the books, very rich in detail and you can't put them down.  Then watch the movie and come to your own conclusions.
B001U0HBQ0|3.0|One of Fincher's most disappointing films by far. Not nearly as bad as the vacant and horribly acted Panic Room but it's not much more interesting. I don't know what to say. Bored out of my mind. This film has nothing to say. I wouldn't call it completely awful but there is simply not much here to see that has not been done before and much better at that. Confusing themes, direction, and most of all a script that goes nowhere. Near the end I was about to turn the thing off.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good time waster.  a few small glitches but over all a fun timekeeper highly recommend this very simple game as as f d k
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|I cannot believe how overrated and underrated this film is. I can see a masterpiece here if two hours or so were added to the experience. As is this is nothing more than some great snippets from childhood and a half-baked creationist saga. I like it more than I feel okay about it but it just doesn't have that feeling some of his other films have. Malick is a seriously talented auteur who I am sure struggled with putting this into a digestible film for theaters, but this is clearly not good enough in my opinion.<br /><br />I don't really have a problem with the CGI or anything but none of this grows into a cohesive whole. I just feel like IN THE LEAST another hour should have been added on here. I can only give this work four stars and I feel 3.5. As it stands it is nothing more than a glance into the entire vision of what could be, or really what they have time to do. I hope there is a director's cut.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|What a thrilling novel. Margaret and Kami make up the Super-Author-Wonder-Team with this series. There was a roller-coaster of emotions throughout the whole novel. Perhaps one of the novels greatest qualities (besides the great characters, the fascinating imagery, and of course an all-around great story line) was that the book stayed interesting the whole time. Once I settled in bed for at night to start reading, I really couldn't force myself to put this book down. Once one question would get answered in the book, twenty more would appear. The last page of the book leaves us with perhaps the biggest question of all; what is it that Ridley plans to do and how is it going to affect all Casters? I have nothing but positive things to say about this book. We watched as Ethan looses the love of his life, Lena, and then how he went to the ends of the world (literally) to protect her from her greatest enemy, herself. We also get to watch as Link's character transforms into the hick-town best friend, to an almost-studdly knight in shining armor. To add to it, new characters are introduced that provide quite a bit of conflict in the book. Beautiful Darkness takes you through so many twists and turns, throws some unexpected curve balls, but in the end it makes for an excellent story.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|I cannot believe the amount of people on here with their 'no payoff' bull****. This IS great filmmaking. The outcome may not be something of a secret but the it's how it builds that is the point. It is the emotional antagonism and realism that you value in a picture like this. All the actors do their job beyond the call of duty. That this film scores one star is beyond preposterous and is a symptom a much deeper culture clash of idiots and sycophants who need some kind of 'payoff' in a film. Something to tell them that what they watched was so valuable and so worth their time. **** these people man. This film is fabulous. I am in love with the acting and direction in this film. FIRST RATE. I do think on another plane that the ending could have just blacked out with him seeing daylight after opening the doors in the end. That would have incited a riot I am sure in America but could have been another great alternate ending. I am sure they considered it. I think a few foreign films have done similar and also the excellent film Limbo did something like this as well.
1468161660|5.0|You may or may not have heard about this little book called Slammed. If you have, I bow down to you. If you have not you are 1) seriously missing out and 2) you better let me describe it to you! This book was beyond brilliant! It shocked me to the very core all while telling a beautiful, beautiful story. I loved this book from the very first sentence and I am still loving it days after reading it. Since I could go on and on about every little thing I adored about this book (which if I am being completely honest is practically the whole thing), I decided a review just wouldn't do it justice. Instead this is going to be a big list of love. Here's what I thought made this book magical:<br /><br />-It was set in Michigan. Okay one may think that this makes my opinion a little biased, and hey maybe they are right, but regardless I loved that it was set in the very state in which I live in. I know how sucky, beautiful, and cold Michigan can be. I can understand why Lake was so determined to hate moving to this wonderfully boring stated of mine. But mostly I just loved reading about a town I have actually been to before!<br /><br />-The name Layken. I understand that this is really a minor detail but I still loved it. This was such a unique name and it was great to see something so different!<br /><br />-The Avett Brothers. If you've read this blog, you know these guys are among one of my favorite bands. Not only do they have a super unique sound but their music is raw and beautiful. As you can probably guess, this band meant a great deal to our main character and their music played such a huge, huge, HUGE part in this book. It was great to see how their lyrics would set the tone for every chapter. I also loved that their songs got our main character through the toughest time in her life.<br /><br />-Layken (the actual character this time, not just the name). This girl is brilliant. She is heartbroken, sad, troubled but even through all of this she is strong, a superb big sister, and she tries so hard to make it through every day. I felt that Layken was so easy to relate to and I could understand the pain she was going through. I knew from the very beginning she would be a great main character and boy was I right!<br /><br />-Will Cooper. This boy, oh my this boy &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 He has had his fair share of heart breaks in the past couple of years so that makes him this beautifully broken boy. I love the way he is with Layken. I love how he seems to be so torn between what he wants and what he thinks the right thing is. I love how driven he is. I love his sense of humor and passion. I love his love and responsibility over his brother. I love his love of poetry. I love the impact he makes on Layken's life. I just flat-out love HIM.<br /><br />-The poetry, oh man the AMAZING poetry. I will not lie; I had never before been a fan of poetry. Those days in the 6th grade when we were forced to memorize AND repeat a Robert Frost poem scarred me for a lifetime. However, the poetry that this book opened my eyes to was so different. I was able to understand it in my own way, it touched me, and I sort of fell in love with it. Now don't get me wrong, reading these poems and actually watching them be performed in a slam are two completely different things but you get an idea of how powerful this type of poetry can be.<br /><br />-Eddie. I am a huge fan of well-written best friends and people, it really doesn't get much better than Eddie. She was a vibrant ball of sunshine from the first moment she cannon-balled right into Layken's life. She was so friendly and accepting, no questions asked. Just reading about her and her contagious passion for life made me want to be best friends with her!<br /><br />-Kel & Caulder. Lake and Will's younger brothers brought so much fun to this story! I loved how these two boys interacted, became best friends, and saw the best in every dark situation. It seemed that every time things really began to get down in Lake's life, these boys were there to do some wacky, hilarious thing to make it a little better.<br /><br />-Lake's mom. My heart hurt so bad for her. As a reader, you could see the pain she was going through and how this move was a drastic attempt at piecing her family together again. Lake was not always easy on her mom, but her mom managed to stand her ground. I was able to see just where Lake got her strength and compassion from.<br /><br />-The heartache. For as much love as there is in this book, there is just as much if not more heartache. I was an emotional wreck throughout Slammed but please do yourself a favor and do NOT let that deter you from reading it. We have all experienced loss and let-downs in some way or another and this book does an excellent job on touching on those feelings that everyone goes through.<br /><br />-The love. Like I said, there is so much love in this book. We have Layken and Will's love for each other; Layken's love for her mom, younger brother, and her lost father; Will's love for his brother and late parents; Layken's love for her friends and their love for her; Will's love of poetry; Seriously, my heart almost burst with how beautiful all of the love was.<br /><br />-Colleen's writing. It must really mean something if I can formulate a list like this over one book. Even though I listed all of these things, what it really came down to was how this story was laid out which just happens to be impeccable. Colleen's writing flowed with ease. It was magical, authentic, and so genuine. Not once did I feel the story was rushed, the characters & their feelings unreal, or even a scene that just didn't belong. Everything seemed to fit together so perfectly!<br /><br />I hope if there is one thing I can convince you from this list (aside from the fact that I am an obsessive list maker and professional rambler) is that you NEED to read this book! It was a story that shocked me and I just know it will do the same to you!, these boys were there to do some wacky, hilarious thing to make it a little better.<br /><br />-Lake's mom.

B007P6VLRS|4.0|Alright, so let me be an alternate voice here by first stating that Smashing Pumpkins were never a favorite of mine, but I have bought all of their albums plus Zwan and Billy Corgan's solo album. My wife can't stand the Pumpkins music. I get it. Billy is a bit of a whiny singer and his music is pretty melancholy and/or messy in terms of sound. If Billy asked me if he has made a five star album I'd have to say no, but he has come up with many great songs and a few good albums. I was never a fan (or sucker) for the grunge movement when it arrived in the early 1990's. I was first exposed to the Pumpkins with the video for \\"Today\\" in 1993. I didn't like it at first but it grew on me. It was 1995's \\"Mellon Collie\\" that was my first Pumpkins purchase, and it was a lot to digest.<br /><br />At any rate, I respect Corgan even when he's not on the mark. I just think he derails on almost every album he makes--yes, even \\"Siamese Dream\\" and \\"Mellon Collie\\". He is prone to excess and I have never liked that about his musical approach. On \\"Oceania\\" there are a few songs that could have been left off as b-sides and the album would have been tighter, more concise, maybe even a five star album. I know you can just skip tracks or program them out, but that's not the point. The point is for an artist to know when to say when and Billy often thinks more is less or more is never enough. So, you tell me, I would have cut \\"Panopticon\\", \\"Glissandra\\" and \\"Inkless\\". I believe cutting those three tracks and making a 10 track album in the same song cycle would be a perfect album. I liked \\"Pinwheels\\" and \\"Oceania\\"--and I typically do not like Pumpkins' 8+ minute songs as a general rule, except maybe for \\"Stumbleine\\".<br /><br />\\"Oceania\\" as a whole is probably the most cohesive Pumpkins album since \\"Mellon Collie\\" (which I understand Billy was quoted as saying as well). Well, it's just the plain truth. I don't understand other fans who say that \\"Oceania\\" is no different from other recent Pumpkins albums. Unless you are looking for that angry, messy, squelchy guitar Pumpkins of yore (which I didn't care for to be honest). I like the more melodic Pumpkins songs like \\"Today\\", \\"Disarm\\", \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\", \\"1979\\", \\"Thirty-Three\\", \\"Tonight, Tonight\\", \\"Perfect\\", \\"This Time\\", \\"With Every Light\\", \\"Starz\\", \\"Neverlost\\", \\"El Sol\\", \\"Come With Me\\", \\"Mina Loy\\" and \\"Walking Shade\\". Well there is plenty of memorable melodies here.<br /><br />\\"The Celestials\\", \\"Violet Rays\\", \\"My Love Is Winter\\", \\"One Diamond, One Heart\\", \\"Pale Horse\\", \\"Wildflower\\"--all of these songs have great, memorable melodies and they are broken up with rockers \\"Quasar\\" and \\"The Chimera\\", and hypnotic numbers like \\"Pinwheels\\" and \\"Oceania\\". A good mixture of rhythms, beats and melodies for the first time in years. More please!<br /><br />Yet, as I said before, I have never placed the Pumpkins in my top bands of all time (and I have so much music and so many bands in my collection that the Pumpkins have to compete with). As I always do, I went back and listened to everything Corgan has done in sequential order, and once again I felt that albums that were supposed to be five star classics (\\"Siamese Dream\\", \\"Mellon Collie\\") were painfully weak in places and excessive in others. Likewise, albums that were supposed to be weak (\\"Adore\\", \\"Machina\\") actually had enough good songs on them to save them from the dustbin. But overall, I was left thinking that Corgan is very inconsistent across the board. You can disagree, but I'm trying to be honest here about the quality of Corgan's work over the past 20 years.<br /><br />But maybe things are about to turn around. \\"Oceania\\" shows tremendous promise for the future. And look, it entered the Billboard 200 albums at number four, which is amazing considering how long it's been since the band has had exposure or hits. Also amazing since Corgan is the only remaining original member (that typically does not go over well with hardcore fans).<br /><br />So, ifyou've been away from the Pumpkins for a while because you haven't liked what Corgan has been doing for the past decade, then \\"Oceania\\" should bring you back to the fold. Here's how \\"Oceania\\" compares to Corgan's other works:<br /><br />1991 Gish: Three Stars<br />1993 Siamese Dream: Two and a Half Stars<br />1995 Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness: Three and a Half Stars<br />1998 Adore: Two and a Half Stars<br />2000 MACHINA/The Machines Of God: Three Stars<br />2003 Mary Star Of The Sea (Zwan): Three Stars<br />2005 The Future Embrace (Billy Corgan): Two Stars<br />2007 Zeitgeist: Three Stars<br />2012 Oceania: Four Starsyou've been away from the Pumpkins for a while because you haven't liked what Corgan has been doing for the past decade, then \\"Oceania\\" should bring you back to the fold.

B0052P5DIC|5.0|There are two flaws in this -- the crap packaging of the live album, and the fact that \\"The Endless Night\\" on the live album starts in the middle of the track \\"Opening 77\\" again and wasn't fixed from the previous 2 CD set.  This is easily fixed by ripping though.
B00846TTDG|2.0|This could have been a good action movie, or it could have been a story about the lives of men serving their country. As it is, the director did a very poor job of trying to do both and in the process did neither very well. The action scenes are well done, technically correct, and gripping, and the plot is moderately interesting and creative. But they are interspersed with a totally superficial and glib portrayal of the lives of soldiers and their families, with no real character development or interesting stories. The WWII films that the likes of Bogart and Wayne did are much better are bringing the trials and tribulations of military folks to life. The characters in this film are total cliches, and the tear-jerking is over the top. As a result, the movie is confused, trite, and not worth watching IMHO.
1476712042|1.0|When I picked up this book (and paid money for it, unfortunately), I was simply curious as to what the fuss was about, especially with it being picked up for film rights by Warner Bros. Many of you out there are like me where we have to read the book before the movie comes out.<br /><br />I can safely assure you that I will not be spending a dime on that movie, if it ever does get made.<br /><br />My curiosity led to a major migraine at 1am last night that hasn't fully gone away. I dub this migraine.. 'Shitty books that should have never been published.'<br /><br />If there was a desk in my room, you best believe there would be a permanent head mark on there from just last night alone.<br /><br />'Beautiful Disaster' was half of what it was named. A DISASTER. From start to end, I was constantly asking myself why...why...WHY ARE YOU READING THIS? The truth is, I paid the money and unfortunately Barnes and Noble doesn't offer refunds for nook books. This book was a complete and utter disaster.<br /><br />The characters of Abby and Travis are lifeless, dumb as rocks and just plain crazy. At some points I had high hopes for Abby, hoping that she would see how psychotic Travis is and how unhealthy their relationship is turning out but then she went and turned out to be just like Travis! By the end of the novel, I was completely disgusted with the two and scoffed my way through the epilogue where they actually get MARRIED. You know, only a few months after knowing each other and having the unhealthiest relationship ever. \\"ZOMG WE SURVIVED A FIRE, THE MOB AND THANKSGIVING DINNER.. LET'S TOTES GET MARRIED AND HAVE BABIESSSSSS!\\"<br /><br />Rumor has it that this book started out originally as fanfiction. Here's the thing, I've read a TON of fanfiction and have my own opinion about it being pulled to publish etc. (See my review of 'Fifty'). I don't know exactly which one 'Beautiful Disaster' really was but if the characters were originally Bella and Edward, boy did she ever go overboard with the OOC.<br /><br />I've also heard that people are comparing Travis and his \\"loving\\" ways to that of Edward Cullen. If this is what the publishing world is looking for now in their male character that women will all want, there is seriously something wrong with this world. Why yes, I totally want to marry a possessive guy who goes batshit crazy when he isn't around me, has slept with 99% of the school's female population and has given me a nickname that resembles a bird that is fat, shits like crazy and is ugly as hell. HELLO TRUE LOVE!<br /><br />This book wasn't a 'Beautiful Disaster': It was a bunch of pages suffering from multiple personality disorder. If I wanted to deal with those kinds of characters, I should have called up my mother.<br /><br />Please don't spend your hard-earned money on this, I beg of you.o overboard with the OOC.<br /><br />I've also heard that people are comparing Travis and his \\"loving\\" ways to that of Edward Cullen.

He'd led such a tightly held life and his extraordinary walk serves as a wrench that opens his heart and mind to the beauty and terribleness that is life for himself and his fellow man.

B000I5SY5U|3.0|Great entertainment, but there is something about the film that has always bothered me, although most reviewers would accuse me of nit-picking (and probably they are right). Liza Minnelli is at her musical peak - and that is the problem. Sally Bowles is a third-rate talent performing in a third-rate club. This is something that the Broadway versions have always understood, in that they have always casted Sally with an actress who could sing rather than a singer who could act (especially the most recent version with Natasha Richardson). Minnelli's Sally is way too talented - she would have been \\"discovered\\" a long time ago and whisked away from the Kit Kat Club. That being said, however, sit back and enjoy Bob Fosse's dazzling direction, Joel Grey's chilling, award-winning MC, and Minnelli belting out her songs in the inimitable Minnelli style.

B007L6VR12|5.0|Once in a while, a movie comes along that's just so magical that there's no way to describe it. Moonrise Kingdom is one such. It comes across as an utterly low-key indie flick, but with boggling star power: Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, and Tilda Swinton. But even at that, the kids take the movie over, as they should.<br /><br />The couple, age twelvish, come across with authenticity that borders on painful. Each is disaffected, each wants more and sees it within reach, and each sees it within the other, somehow. They take off on their doomed trek, together, trusting in each other and not a lot else. And, along the way, they share some of the more awkward moments of young love - with utterly serious solemnity, as kids do when trying to act grown up.<br /><br />The thing is, they do it - at least sort of. They make enemies, and defeat them. They need allies, and make them. And, in the end, they win, sort of. The adult actors rise to the children's level, especially Swinton in the role of Social Services (apparently wearing what she found in a Pan Am stewardess's closet). But, don't worry. Nothing I can say can really be a spoiler. When something, even something very familiar, is done very well, it becomes a new thing. This is done very, very well. Even with its near-total lack of special effects, it's very special indeed.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0439023491|3.0|(Minor spoilers ahead...)<br />This isn't the extraordinary tale I'd thought it would be, from all the hubbub surrounding this series right now.  Catching Fire is little more than a filler between the first and third books, though it does have its page-turning moments.  Unfortunately, the entire book, up to the last several pages, seems to be leading up to something big; sadly, this big reveal is hastily dumped out as a quick summary with hardly any dialogue on one of the final pages, and we're left with little more than a (spoiler) Empire Strikes Back ending that only sets things up for the third book in the trilogy.  While several new characters (each with a great deal of potential) are introduced in Catching Fire, their development is nearly nonexistent; throughout the entire book, I was waiting for each to meet their own arbitrary end, as has happened with so many other of these blank faces thus far.  I can only hope this character development occurs for those who survived into the third book.<br /><br />Make no mistake--this is an enjoyable read to pass the time, but the plot is tired (apocalyptic near future, corrupt government, oppression leading to revolution).  The characters have the potential to set this tale apart, but unfortunately, Collins just doesn't seem to care enough about them to let us know more than Katniss' own brief mental musings, so it's difficult to care about anyone other than Katniss and Peeta.  Though the ending leaves us with a tiny bit of hope, I'm not holding my breath for any beloved characters to walk out of this trilogy alive, because Collins finds it much too easy to dispose of her characters in a sudden and brutal way, while rarely giving them weight enough for the reader to care.  Yes, this trilogy seems to be the story of Katniss and Peeta, but for all of two books so far, we've been continually prepped for their deaths, only for it to be seemingly postponed a little longer.  In a world where death has reigned for nearly all of the last two books, the characters have been a little too resigned and eager to participate in the Games while their backstories have been kept from us, and the revolution has taken place out of our view (as far as we know?), I'm not sure Collins will have enough time in the third book to add the emotional weight this story needs to provide a satisfying conclusion and stick with me.  If, rather than the story of the revolution of Panem, this is simply the more intimate tale of Katniss and Peeta as it has seemed to be, the second half of Catching Fire is little more than a repeat of the first book, with a few extra blank faces, and all that was done to advance their story and situation was done off-camera and communicated to the reader almost as an aside at the end.  Overall, this was a page turner, but I was a bit disappointed once the pages ran out.f the last two books, the characters have been a little too resigned and eager to participate in the Games while their backstories have been kept from us, and the revolution has taken place out of our view (as far as we know?), I'm not sure Collins will have enough time in the third book to add the emotional weight this story needs to provide a satisfying conclusion and stick with me.

0007477155|5.0|I ordered these books after watching the TV Series. There are 7 large books in the series. I have finished book #1 & am well into book #2. The books so far are very hard to put down---you always want to see what is going to happen next. I love the format of the chapters--each is not too long and deals with a character instead of having chapter numbers. The author often leaves you hanging at the end of each chapter---so it becomes necessary to read further to discover the outcome.Therefore, all of a sudden, you find that you have finished the entire book & can't wait to start the next one!

B004EPYZSK|3.0|Scott Mitchell Rosenberg first devised this silly story as a comic book aka graphic novel - and it should have stayed in that format.  It is worrisome to note in the credits that the screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby and Steve Oedekerk: six cooks in one kitchen do not a successful meal create.  So we know from the start that this is a joke and as a joke it becomes entertaining in parts and just plain silly in others - sort of like a comic book...<br /><br />The `story' unfolds when a spaceship arrives in Arizona, 1873, to take over the Earth, starting with the Wild West region where a lone cowboy leads an uprising against a terror from beyond our world. A stranger (Daniel Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. The only hint to his history is a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been (excerpted from the package insert).<br /><br />Aside from Daniel Craig (still buff) and Harrison Ford (long in the tooth) the cast includes a lot of mechanical gooey multihanded and body compartmented aliens (identities withheld), Paul Dano, Sam Rockwell, Abigal Spencer, Keith Carradine, Olivia Wilde, and a lot of other one-liner actors. It is all rather silly and over the top, but then that is the popular concept in epic films these days. You pays your money and you takes your choice. Grady Harp, August 12ese days.

This package is very well put together in a cardboard slipcase and a pocket that holds 4 transparencies for each of the cartoon band members plus a nifty 16-page colour booklet containing an introduction by John Lasseter of Pixar fame among a number of other interesting quotes and articles from others.<br /><br />The all important picture quality is excellent looking fabulous in 1080p and I really enjoyed the sound quality in DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround although a PCM Stereo option is also available.  The only complaint I have about the sound quality is that the spoken dialogue is a little softer than when the musical bits come up which is a little annoying as the sudden increase in volume levels whenever the scene switches from the songs to the spoken bits may cause you to want to quickly reach for the remote before you wake up the neighbours but thankfully the difference in volume levels isn't too wide although it is wide enough for me to notice.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is an excellent, very well put together release from Apple (the original non-tech company) with great cartoon content, very good picture and sound quality as well making this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
0452270073|3.0|What would you do if, as a psychiatrist, your job was to cure young men who have been rendered physically damaged by the mental and emotional horrors they have seen during one of the worst wars of all time? And what if your curing them merely sent them back into the conflict that started their illness in the first place? Is your duty to your employer - your country - to get them back in fighting shape or to the best interests of the men?<br /><br />This is the dilemma posed in Pat Barker's \\"Regeneration\\". It begins in July 1917, when officer Siegfried Sassoon, a decorated fighter in His Majesty's army, publishes a piece in the London Times condemning the war, claiming that those in charge are deliberately prolonging it to an end not specified to the men fighting in it. To avoid national embarrassment (after all, Sassoon is a hero who has saved the lives of many men), he is sent to Craiglockhart, a hospital for mentally ill soldiers, to recover. Immediately, his psychiatrist, Dr. Rivers, notes the main problem with this scenario: Sassoon isn't mentally ill. After all, is it insane for a man literally in the trenches to question the reason for the endless killing? Compared with the other patients, who have been rendered mute, suffer endless nightmares, or have terrible stammers, Sassoon is a fine specimen of a soldier. But what would he do to himself if he were put back in the position of fighting?<br /><br />While the book claims to be about Sassoon and the other patients featured, it in reality is about Dr. Rivers. The war has changed his outlook on psychiatry and anthropology, forcing him to confront several previously-held ideas. How does one go about helping a man who has seen and experienced the unimaginable? Is curing him by forcing him to relieve those memories really the best option when his mind has found other ways to adapt? Is it right to buck him up, just to send him back into the trenches? And is he truly really any different from other psychiatrists ofthe day who use far more controversial methods to achieve essentially the same result?<br /><br />I've been on a bit of a quest to read books centered around World War I, and after a recommendation for this one popped up, I jumped on it. The book itself is very different from what I had imagined, and brings up several issues I hadn't previously explored. While the thought-provoking questions are indeed good, the story itself is very slow, focusing more on ethical issues than an actual tale. It was a bit much for me, but it definitely brings to the front a side of war I hadn't previously considered.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I loved using my Kindle for Android app. I'd read and download something new pretty much every day. Then I updated the app and it won't even open now. Tech support has ignored me (I was supposed to have an update on my ticket on August 16, 2012.). It is obviously a software glitch since other apps are still working fine, including the new ones I added. I deleted all of them thinking they might be a conflict, but the problem is with Kindle for Android, not my tablet or any other apps. All it does is try to open and then throw me back out.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This review is about the DVD. I have to say I haven't been purchasing movies with the feature of the so-called \\"Digital Copy\\" because it was actually Ultraviolet. I was a big fan of the books and with all pop culture, made plans to get the movie. I was not expecting to be so happy as I read the box. With this 2 disc DVD, you get the option of iTunes Digital Copy or Ultraviolet! I can only hope that more movies will have the same choices (though I know I'll be just dandy with iTunes)!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Purchased the E17 after reading several blogs from Steve Guttenberg at cnet. The E17 was nicely packaged as described elsewhere and was very easy to set up. Build quality is excellent and classy. I am using it to listen to music from my Windows PC. The improvement is noticeable but not overpowering. I found myself noticing elements of the music that were not there before and enjoying the clarity of the sound.<br /><br />I also used it with my Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket and did not hear much of an improvement. I was almost relived to not have to bundle the two components up with the included bands and carry them around.<br /><br />At first I was going to order a less expensive DAC but I am very glad I purchased the E17. It provides immediate payback in sound quality and has the ability to be useful in a number of different configurations. It is of sufficient quality and capability that I will not outgrow it for many years.<br /><br />Yes, I would reccomend the E17 without hesitation

YOU NEED THIS NEW TOOLKIT FROM THE LAW SOCIETY, WITH ACCOMPANYING CD-ROM<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Yes, that's right.  From January 2013, every law firm must have an authorised compliance officer for legal practice (COLP), following the impact of the Bribery Act 2010 and the Legal Services Act 2007.  If you're a practitioner, whether a sole practitioner, or in a firm, we can think of no reason more compelling than acquiring this extremely useful book, one of the Law Society's highly regarded and eminently practical `toolkits' (part of the Law Society's risk and compliance service).<br /><br />In force as of 1 July 2011, the Bribery Act 2010 requires that -- in the words of the Law Society -- commercial organisations of any size must `review their procedures and look to their lawyers for the development of policies and training to establish anti-corruption safeguards,' one of which is of course, the appointment of a compliance officer.<br /><br />The Law Society has therefore produced a series of extremely informative and helpful new `toolkits', each designed to help practitioners cope with the new regulatory environment.<br /><br />Produced in handy paperback format with accompanying CD, each `toolkit' contains supremely clear and practical advice that has emerged following this significant new legislation.  If you or your clients are or might be directly affected by the new legislation, (or possibly indirectly) you might decide to acquire all three, namely the `Anti-Bribery Toolkit'... `the COFAs Toolkit'... and the `COLPs Toolkit'.<br /><br />For purposes of this review, we are focusing on Michelle Garlick's `COLPs Toolkit', which contains draft policies and procedural checklists, from governance policies and draft letters, to recording and nomination forms and a compliance checklist.<br /><br />The contents cover the rules themselves and their application and further chapters deal with compliance and reporting to the SRA, the Solicitors Regulation Authority.  The CD-ROM provides useful appendices, including relevant policies, draft communications and forms which you can immediately use, providing they're adapted to specific needs.<br /><br />Distinguished for convenience, clarity and practical approach, this toolkit and its two companion volumes have all been designed for the benefit of busy practitioners, particularly sole practitioners.

We would also add that family lawyers in general, particularly those assisting the elderly or vulnerable, should acquire it as a matter of urgency.<br /><br />This new second edition augments the previous title: `Mental Capacity: The New Law', published in the wake of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, which introduced changes in the law to protect persons lacking mental capacity.<br /><br />Shortly afterward, the new statutory Court of Protection was created specifically to make decisions on behalf of those lacking the capacity to make them.  This important book has therefore been designed to help practitioners and other professionals meet the challenges which have emerged following the Act.<br /><br />This edition presents the latest developments in legislation, procedure and case law.  Such issues as the deprivation of liberty safeguards are carefully examined and the re-emergence of the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court is also dealt with.<br /><br />And bearing in mind that the Court of Protection presides not only in respect of welfare issues, but it is also empowered to make decisions about property, financial and related matters, and the book deals authoritatively with the cross-over here to administrative law matters.<br /><br />Important commentary is made throughout, notably regarding the new social and legal climate that emphasizes personal autonomy and which, as general editor Gordon Ashton points out, favours community care and disapproves of discrimination in any form.<br /><br />`It should not be overlooked,' he says, `that those who lack mental capacity frequently have other physical or mental impairments as well, so the combined implications of mental and physical disabilities have to be considered.'<br /><br />Here then is a work of reference distinguished for its lucid, rational and compassionate approach to this most difficult area of law.  As you would expect from a work of this authority and stature, there are extensive and valuable research resources, including tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, as well as a table of European materials.<br /><br />The table of contents is clearly detailed - and for further ease of use, there's a useful index at the back.  If you're a family practitioner in particular, you'd be wise to add this book to  your professional library.

Rightly described as the `general backbone of the book' it examines in detail the current law in this field, presents relevant extracts from case-law and discusses the applicability of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to each of the above-named regulators.<br /><br />Chapters two to six, termed the `regulator specific chapters' deal with each regulator in turn.  Interestingly, Chapter 4 points out that the HCPC currently regulates 16 professions, from arts therapists and biomedical scientists to radiographers and speech and language therapists -- and, as of August 2012, social workers.<br /><br />Within its almost 700 pages, the book provides, in compact, yet comprehensive form,  a guide to every stage of what are referred to as `fitness to practice proceedings', including how to prepare the case,  how to conduct it, how present it at the hearing  and more, including the issue of referrals to the Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA).<br /><br />In addition to useful tips and tactics, broader issues are also dealt with, including reviews, appeals and judicial review, as well as mediation and the difficult matter of costs.<br /><br />A mine of information on avenues for further research, the book includes tables of cases, cases, statutes and statutory instruments, as well as a table of European legislation and a table of guidance, plus detailed index at the back.<br /><br />If you are in any way involved with assisting in professional disciplinary matters, you would do well to acquire this book.

I fell in love with it since I saw the film when in was released in theaters. I was not familiar with the books nor am i still. I will read them from the beginning which I received all three books from Amazon since I pre-ordered the movie but unfortunately, I have not found the time to read them since I am currently reading \\"The Mortal Instruments\\" books...which have nothing to do with this...lol. Anyways, I love the film adaption. I just hope that it is similar to the books and not like other books-turned-to-movies adaptions. I love each character and i am amazed at the acting of each character. They were perfect. Anyways I give it a 5 because all in all I love the film.

It features a heroine who does not sit on her hands (hair?) waiting to be rescued, so that's a nice change from many other \\"princess\\" movies.  The songs are appealing and do not grate on one's nerves (grandma's and grandpa's in particular) upon frequent repetition.
