B00005JN2F|4.0|If you're looking for an intelligent action film, this is it!  Knowing little about Bourne adds to the intrigue and mystery of the character.  You never know quite what he's going to do when things get tough, but you know someone is going to pay for starting something with the wrong guy!  A real rollercoaster of a movie!
B0000035E7|5.0|To start this off, I would like to say that this album is great. It was the first Nirvana album I bought, as it was the only one the record store I was at had in stock. I had never heard of it before, but when I listened to it I was blown away. As I've seen on previous reviews of this album, I will list the songs and give a rating and brief synopsis of it.  <br />  <br /> 1. Blew - 3/5 - This is a decent song, but with such better ones on &quot;Bleach&quot; it's not worth the time. <br /> 2. Floyd the Barber - 4/5 - When I first heard this one, I immediately liked the jerking start-stop guitar and drums. When I learned the lyrics, I only liked this song more. <br /> 3. About a Girl - 5/5 - It's catchy, it's upbeat, and it's a change from the rest of the album. It's great. <br /> 4. School - 3.5/5 - See &quot;Blew.&quot; <br /> 5. Love Buzz - 3.5/5 - Catchy, and good solos, but there's better on &quot;Bleach.&quot; <br /> 6. Papercuts- 5/5 - Depressing and noisy, the contrast of the heavy guitar, bass, and drums and the mostly soft vocals makes for a grrrrrreat song. <br /> 7. Negative Creep - 5/5 - What can I say? I love it. <br /> 8. Scoff - 4.5/5 - This song is just good old-fashioned fun. <br /> 9. Swap Meet - 5/5 - Catchy, driving, and angsty. What more could one want? <br /> 10. Mr. Moustache - 5/5 - Yes I eat cow, I am not proud. <br /> 11. Sifting - 4/5 - Tasty, but not delicious. <br /> 12. Big Cheese - 4/5 - See &quot;Sifting.&quot; <br /> 13. Downer - 3.5/5 - Good song, but it gets old after twenty straight listenings. <br />  <br /> While &quot;In Utero&quot; is more melodic and has some songs (i.e.- Rape Me, FFWHHROS, Milk It) which are easily better than anything on &quot;Bleach,&quot; I will always have a special place in my heart for this album. &quot;Nevermind&quot; cannot match up with this one at all. &quot;Incesticide&quot; is punkier, but not up to par with &quot;Bleach.&quot;
B00005A46T|5.0|Boy, does this cd ROCK!!! From the beginning track, People=Sh*t, I couldn't sit still! Now, naturally everyone in my family was annoyed by the heaviness and the language, which gave me more reasons to turn it up louder and louder. lol. Anyways, this cd has some great tracks (my favorites are My Plague, Left Behind, and Everything Ends, in that order). I've heard a good number of people say they didn't like &quot;Gently.&quot; Maybe it's just that I haven't heard anything off of Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat, but I personally think it's a cool song. Anyone into Slipknot, heavy music, and stuff that gets their parents mad should give this one a look.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is possibly the greatest hip hop album of all time. This album is just simply amazing. Every track is perfect with absolutely no flaws. The only flaw is that the album is kinda short with only 9 tracks. However, quality outweights quantity. Other albums got tracks that are wack with guest appearances and skits that are pointless, but this album is straight fire. With absolutely no skits and one perfect guest appearance in AZ at &quot;Life's a Bitch&quot;, this album is simply a CLASSIC! This album epitomizes hip-hop. These days, eminem, 50 cent and nelly rule hip-hop, and that is just a shame, when they sell millions of copies with their wack albums. <br />  <br /> 1. Intro- worth listening to. It starts off with a grimey subway sound and it ends with Nas and AZ talking about the wack music in the radio these days. Pretty cool introduction. <br />  <br /> 2. NY State of Mind- This track is simply amazing. With a grimey New York City beat, he raps about life in his ghetto Queensbridge. <br /> A+ <br />  <br /> 3. Life's a Bitch- With a special guest appearance in AZ, this track is memorable. With beautiful lyrics and superb flow, both Nas and AZ are best at this track. A+ <br />  <br /> 4. World is Yours- WOW!!!..This is what I'm talking about. Nas again spits sick lyrics and amazes us with his use of metaphor and flow. A+ <br />  <br /> 5. Halftime- Another amazing track. The beat is pretty hardcore, and his lyrics coincides exactly with the beat, making this track just plain dope. A+ <br />  <br /> 6. Memory Lane- This song relaxes your mind and takes your soul to somewhere magical. Mad Dope Song. A+ <br />  <br /> 7. One Love- With a classical beat, Nas raps about his people in jail. SICK! A+ <br />  <br /> 8. One Time 4 your Mind- This is the weakest song in the whole album, it's still good but the beat is kinda slow, however his lyrics are still amazing in this song. A- <br />  <br /> 9. Represent- Another Dope track, he raps about representing things and his hood. AMAZING! A+ <br />  <br /> 10. It Aint Hard to Tell- SICK!!!...Pure poetry, his lyrics are fire and his flow is just perfect. A+ <br />  <br /> Everyone buy this album. It's pure poetry and his lyrics are just magical!
B00006RCNW|5.0|From the ending of the first episode when Vic Mackey shoots Terry Crowley dead, I was hooked. I absolutely love this show. I have never actually been a fanatic of any show ever until I started watching The Shield. I am such a fanatic I even went and bought the short 5 issue comic book series of The Shield. I have not bought comic books in years. Just goes to show you just how good I think this show is. This show takes the edginess of NYPD Blue and takes it to another level. You also love to hate alot of the characters. Especially Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis)and David Aceveda(Benito Martinez) the most. All I have to say is. BUY THIS!!!  ...and Season 2  :-)
B000002B1M|5.0|When this album first came out in 1996, there were negative reviews about this LP because they claimed it was not better than his 1994 debut album &quot;Illmatic&quot;. They are completely wrong. I gotta say this album is simply amazing, a CLASSIC! People who thinks this album is wack probably listens to Eminem, 50 cent or Nelly. This album is just dope. Anywayz, I feel that this album should deserve more credit as being a CLASSIC, cuz there are no albums in the last couple years that could actually match the brilliance of Nas' lyrics and unorthodox flow. Nas has one thing that many rappers these days lack, and that is substance. When all the other rappers are rappin about girls, money and sex. Nas raps about deep essential things such as life, street stories and knowledge. This album is little more mafioso than his other releases, it's still AMAZING! Everyone get this album. <br />  <br /> 1. Intro- Worth listening to. It's aite. <br />  <br /> 2. The Message - Amazing song, some consider this song to be a diss towards Tupac, however still amazing. A+ <br />  <br /> 3. Street Dreams- Pretty cool song, kinda commerical for my taste, stil amazing though. B+ <br />  <br /> 4. I gave you Power- WOW!!!!...Just AMAZING!!!...Possibly the most creative rap song ever. Nas raps about his unique perspective as a gun. WOW! A++ <br />  <br /> 5. Watch Dem Niggas- Kinda boring track. Foxy's chorus is kinda annoying, good lyrics though. B- <br />  <br /> 6. Take in Blood- Another good track. I love the beat in this song. A <br />  <br /> 7. Nas is Coming- A song that attempted to stop the east coast vs. west coast rap war. It has an annoying chorus. i don't really like this song. B- <br />  <br /> 8. Affirmative Action- The Firm's first song. Sick verses by AZ, Cormega, Nas and even Foxy makes this song hot. A+ <br />  <br /> 9. Set Up- This song is cool. Nice lyrics and a cool beat. B <br />  <br /> 10. Black Girl Lost- Nas tells a story about how girls shouldn't act like hoes and try to get the better things in life. A <br />  <br /> 11. Suspect- An average track. B- <br />  <br /> 12. Shootouts- Sick track. Sick street story. B+ <br />  <br /> 13. Live Nigga Rap- SICK TRACK. This song features Mobb Deep. B+ <br />  <br /> 14. If I Ruled the World- SICK!!!!!...One of the best songs in the album. A+
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek (2001), Dreamworks SKG, From the directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson.  This is an adult size, animated, color movie, with the witty voice of Edie Murphy - not the ordinary children's cartoon.  The plot for this movie is taken from those childhood fairy tale characters and rolled into one humorous cartoon.  The voice of donkey is the great comedian Edie Murphy.  His character added to the character of Shrek, voice done by Mike Myers, is an enjoyable light hearted entertainment that can be enjoyed by the child in all of us.  The satire contained in the movie will be caught by the adult.  The rating of the movie allows younger children to watch with some explanations by parents.  Shrek is one of those movies that if you walk into the room and it is playing you will just have to take a break and sit for a spell.  I would recommend this movie, for this reason five stars is allowed.
0446607274|5.0|As in the previous books in the Harry Bosch series, Connelly works in plot twists galore. This is very satisfying; especially when combined with the &quot;poetic justice&quot; ending. I don't really like the way he portrays the upper brass as being perfectly willing to sacrifice an old cop to an animalistic mob. Although the way he portrays journalists as immoral and unethical as long as they get good copy seems very realistic which is eerie when you remember Connelly started out as a journalist. And portraying Bosch as understanding and even having sympathy with the riot mentality is rather unbelievable. As a cop, he would understand that society cannot allow and condone groups or sub-groups to go on savage, blood-thirsty rampages because they are angry. This is a city in a civlized country, not a jungle. <br />  <br /> But, overall, an excellent read.
B00000099Y|5.0|If you like your music with the sound of skins being beaten like it's the reincarnation of Stewart Copeland (drummer - The Police... for you youngsters) then Aenima is a dream come true. Danny Carey IMHO is probably the best rock drummer going today and he'll show you why I believe that on this CD. <br />  <br /> This genre of music is sometimes hard to take seriously. Not because the band doesn't have talent, although that is often the case, but rather because the lead singer thinks that screaming is the most effective way to bring forth his message. Absent are intelligent lyrics or interesting tempo changes. Hard core rock or whatever you want to call it often suffers from muscians playing all their instruments at Mach 10 without a single clue about song composition. <br />  <br /> Tool is hard rock personified. The difference is these guys have a high &quot;Get It&quot; factor.
1558216847|2.0|I spent two and a half years living in Mongolia, including time in the Gobi desert. I read the book while I was there. There are no large black snakes in the Gobi (Yes, this is documented; there are very few snake species in Mongolia....), and all of the information about Mongolia and the Gobi is inaccurate to a greater or lesser degree. I have severe doubts about the whole story. Still, if you take it as a work of fantasy, it's an okay way to spend a few hours' free time.
0735619670|5.0|Steve McConnell is very well researched in his viewpoints on software development.  This book educates those who may have missed out on a formal education of the software development process.  Many good non-language specific tips on how to improve the quality of your software.  Helps the reader to think about software more than just the code that goes into it.  Buy three copies -- one for yourself and two for your buddies sitting next to you.
B0002858YS|5.0|First single I heard from them was &quot;Somebody told me&quot; and it was <br /> enough to be hooked. After listening to the entire album several  <br /> times over again you can't help but notice a dash of &quot;The Cure&quot; <br /> in there. If you have just heard the single, you have not heard the best song on this album. I haven't found a &quot;filler&quot; track on the album. Every song has a story and the lyrics are catchy. I don't know how long they will be able to call themselves &quot;indie&quot; <br /> but who cares if you like good music?
B000000W5P|4.0|I think most would agree that this is one of the great &quot;Stones&quot; albums. Everything style-wise is on this one. &quot;Miss You&quot; and &quot;Beast Of Burden&quot; are huge hits, and &quot;Shattered&quot; was as well. &quot;Far Away Eyes&quot; is classic, the Keith sung &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot; is a favorite of mine, and the track &quot;Some Girls&quot; is so good I know a band who named themselves after it. Overall this may not be in their top three albums ever, but I'd call it number four, and give it as many stars. Anyone who says otherwise is telling &quot;Lies&quot;.
B000069AUI|5.0|Hypnotic!  One of only a few cd's in the world that I can listen to from beginning to end, over and over again!  A familiar, yet completely original sound.  This cd feels like home
0060977493|5.0|Sensuous, dreamy, vague, Roy's debut novel is set in India during the late 60s and begins with the funeral of a cousin of the novel's narrator. She (Rahel) and her twin brother Estha share betw them family secrets of unmentionable nature, and these secrets are revealed in circuitous, suspenseful and breathtakingly lovely prose. You have to pay attention during this book, or you'll miss some of the clues to what's going on - and that would be a mistake. Told from the point of view of a child, The God of Small Things exposes politics, social and caste taboos, and the fates which can shatter a family. <br />A tour de force. <br />
B00008BRDX|4.0|Regatta de Blanc may not be a consistent album but I truly believe that even though some songs can be given a miss, the few best Police osngs are there, They are <br /> &quot;message&quot;, &quot;Bring on the night&quot; &quot;walking on the moon&quot; and &quot;bed's too big&quot;.Awesome stuff.
B00008EY65|5.0|Ok i have never read the comics, i thought the idea was a bit silly and the trailers really did nothing for me, but i tried the dvd anyway and i loved the movie, it's funny, action packed, great special effects (amazing how a movie with half the buget of a matrix can do so much better!).<br /><br />as a comic fan i really loved seeing a superhero battle done so well, i mean there has been nice fights in the movies but this one was really rough and tumble and fun to watch, i hope the F4 movies thing looks so well.<br /><br />and the extras are amazing, 4 cartoons, 3 gerald mcboing boing cartoons that i can't figure out why they added them to the dvd but are nonethless fun and class, plus a tell tale heart creepy cartoon from the same period of about 50 years ago.<br /><br />we also have an amazing 2 half hour documentary covering everything you ever wanted to know, trailers and the other normal stuff and more...it's a must buy for any action fan or comic fan.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Honestly, stop complaining about how &quot;Greedo shot first, oh no!&quot; yeah, like that honestly ruined the entire trilogy. I saw both the original version and &quot;special edition&quot; versions of the trilogy, and I saw the special edition to improve on an already great trilogy. I don't see why you think the changes corrupted the movie. Also, the prequels are very good movies, and are welcomed additions to the Star Wars universe. Seriously, stop following what the &quot;public&quot; is telling you, and show your own opinion. Face it, the &quot;special edition&quot; of the original Star Wars trilogy was awesome, the prequels are, and continue to be awesome, and this DVD set, will be awesome. stop with the bull$h1t and admit it!
B000002H33|5.0|I just listened to it the other day on a long drive, I hadn't listened to it in about 10 years and damn, did it kick my ass!!! Solid all the way through out. This is the pinnacle of Metallica's song writing, technical playing skills, and pure aggression. It's hard to believe that this record is almost 20 years old (it was released in 1986) and still sounds fresh to this day. I first heard this when I was 13 years old; it was the record that made me want to pick up a guitar. I am 30 now, and still get chills when I hear certain musical passages on this record. Stand out tracks are &quot;The thing that should not be&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot;, &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Leper Messiah&quot;. But, there is not one track of filler on this record. All these crappy Nu-metal bands nowadays can't even compare to the talent and authenticity of this record and band in that time frame.<br /><br /> Essential.
B0000AM6K2|4.0|&quot;1972&quot; is the fourth full-length release from Nebraska-born and current Nashville resident Josh Rouse. As the album title indicates, Rouse applies liberal doses of '70s pop and R&B to the musical proceedings contained herein. But to dismiss &quot;1972&quot; as a mere period piece is unfair given Rouse's well-honed songwriting skills, the dexterous musical arrangements, and Brad Jones' impeccable production.  <br />  <br /> The nod to Carole King on the title track may be a little too obvious, but the song offers its own &quot;tapestry&quot; of drifter discontent (&quot;we're goin' through the changes/hopin' for replacement/until we find, a way out of this hole&quot;). The immensely catchy &quot;Love Vibration&quot; offers backing vocals reminiscent of the Randy Newman-penned &quot;Welcome Back Kotter&quot; theme to support its decree of free love. The bass-driven &quot;Come Back (Light Therapy)&quot; is a clever ode to seasonal affective disorder, with lyrics such as &quot;maybe if the sun would shine/it would bring my happy back&quot; delivered with much hope but little optimism.  <br />  <br /> Rouse is far less successful when he breaks the feel-good vibe of the album. &quot;Sparrows Over Birmingham&quot; is essentially watered-down gospel despite the clever use of call-and-response vocals, while the honky-tonk piano and clapping hands that provide the rhythm of &quot;Slaveship&quot; can't keep the overly-repetitive lyrics and vocal melodies from sinking the song.  <br />  <br /> The overall quality of the album is best summed up by closing track &quot;Rise,&quot; which plaintively states &quot;...honest things they last.&quot; &quot;1972&quot; showcases Rouse's skill at setting a mood, which works to his advantage as long as he sticks to the formula. He's clearly at his best when keeping things honest and simple, which is why the few missteps on the album stick out that much more. Regardless, &quot;1972&quot; does nothing to hurt Rouse's reputation asa fine pop craftsman.
B000005YZM|5.0|This is the best non-beatles 60s album. Everyone has heard &quot;Time of the Season&quot;, and it,no doubt, is a great classic song but many have not heard this album and their lives are lacking because of it. When I 1st heard &quot;Care of Cell 44&quot; it blew me away. It may be just a simple pop song but something about took me by suprise and made it one of those rare music moments one can only hope for once or twice in a lifetime. And from that moment on this album does not disappoint with stunning songs like &quot;After he's Gone&quot; and &quot;Beechwood Park&quot;. This album evokes a psychadelic mood but not a druggy haze like many albums in its day.Its pop finesse allows you to relax and take you on a beautiful pop 'odessey'. I suggest that anyone who considers himself a fan of well written pop-rock pick up this album and discover the forgotten treasure that it is.
6305897786|3.0|I enjoyed Ninth Gate not because it's a great movie --and it certainly is not, but because it's incredibly funny. Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso a seedy book dealer who will do whatever needs doing to get his book for his well heeled clients. He's not a nice man and he's more cunning than smart. His client Mr. Balkan, played by the always fascinating Frank Langella has a book that was supposedly co-written by Lucifer himself and he needs to know if it's authentic. Corso of course, does not believe in such things and is only intersted in his fee.  <br /> <br />The former owner of the Ninth Gate book wants it back and everyone who has another copy of the book or who Corso talks to about the book ends up dead in horrible ways but Corso is too dumb or too greedy to really be frightened. That's a flaw in the script but it's also unintentionally funny. Any sane person would've realized that this is no ordinary antique book deal and would've quit after the first death. Corso makes a weak complaint to his client and just plods along.  <br /> <br />The expressions on Depp's face when he finds the bodies is a hoot. Other than those fleeting moments he has no other normal reaction to all the death and menace. It's like he's mildly sedated for the entire movie.  <br /> <br />Another amusing thing is the lack of understanding about rare books that the movie displays. In real life an antique book expert would not chain smoke over a 300 year old book, nor would he place drinks next to it.  <br /> <br />When the blonde with the green eyes and huge eyebrows shows up he simply thinks she's been sent by Mr. Balkan to watch him and provide bodyguard service. It never once dawns on him that this girl's uncanny ability to be always be where he needs her and to make things happen might be something more than natural.  <br /> <br />The movie also features one of the silliest sex scenes ever filmed. Depp appeared to be doing an imitation of a man with a severe case of sudden diarrhea and thescene gets the biggest laugh of the movie.  <br /> <br />So what is really good about Ninth Gate? Frank Langella, the actress who played the elderly Barroness, the two (Or was it one?) old guys who play the Spanish booksellers and the scenery.  <br /> <br />What's not so good? The script and direction. Polanski lost his touch years ago and it shows. Still, as long as you don't expect genuine horror or suspense you can have a good time with Ninth Gate.  The foolish plot and inconsistentcies are a nitpickers dream.

0743454529|4.0|I could not put this book down. I just finished reading it and amazing is the word I would use to sum up my feelings on this book. Picoult explores the question of what happens when one of your kids gets sick and only having another kid can save them. This plot grabbed me from page one when you met Anna, who was made in order to save the life of her sister, Kate who has cancer. Anna is a preteen girl who is tired of not having a normal life and feeling like if she does not go through endless medical procedures then she is letting her family down. Anna decides that she no longer to wants to be used to save her sister. She is tired of not being able to have any choices about what happens to her and she feels as though her family does not love her and that the only person they have room for in their lives is Kate and her cancer.  Early in the book you also meet the oldest child of the family, Jesse, the son that has fallen through every crack because the family is so consumed by Kate that they do not have time for Jesse. As he acts out more and more the family is forced to take a look at Jesse and his behavior. I found myself feeling very sorry for Jesse and Anna because through out this book it seemed as though they were really forgotten and felt as though they had no one.  I did not give this book a five because of the mother, Sara. The way she treated Anna was terrible. She made Anna do things that she did not want to do and made it real clear that Anna held Kate's life in her hands and that if something bad happened to Kate then it was Anna'a fault. That is alot to lay on young girl and I could not quite accept the fact that instead of cherishing Anna more and being more grateful for this addition to their family she treated Anna as though she was just there to save Kate.   This book is great. Have a box of tissue handy because I found that it moved me to tears more than once. Jodi Piccoult brought this family to life in a way that most author's can not. I found myself asking questions about my family and how I would feel if that was me. I think this book will stay with me for a long time to come.
0385504209|3.0|I can describe reading this work as similar to eating a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts for supper. There are a number of well-documented reasons why this deviation from a healthy diet is not good for you, but those creme-filled chocolate frosted beauties are just so, so delicious. The same is true of DVC. Despite its factual errors and polemic slant, it is a deliciously intriguing read. I suppose there are many worse ways to be naughty.<br /><br />I would venture to guess that the plot line of this work is generally known: a secret society of European men of science and letters keeping alive an alternative account of the final destiny of Jesus Christ. This secret, so remarkable, has the power to turn traditional Christianity on its head. The villains of the piece are the Roman Catholic Church, whose whole existence in this work has been dedicated to suppressing the secret, and specifically Opus Dei-or a fringe element of the group, at least-which will resort to all sorts of murder and mayhem to obtain the final, conclusive key to the puzzle. Despite the theme of nearly timeless entities, the book moves along with the pace of a \\"24\\" episode and covers roughly a twenty-four hour span of time.<br /><br />What spoil an otherwise excellent read are two factors: the first is the targeting of the Catholic Church and Opus Dei. Every work needs heroes and villains, but I found the Catholic bashing excessive. Brown plays on two current Catholic controversies-a male, clerically based structure of governance and scholarship, and its corollary, the second place status of women, real or imagined, to gain the reader's approbation that yes, Catholicism is quite capable of a fraud the likes of which Brown describes.<br /><br />Secondly, Brown's research is eclectic, selective, and often just wrong. A veritable cottage industry of corrective works has recently appeared on bookshelves in recent months. A reasonably knowledgeable reader will easily spot the more egregious errors; a theologian, historian, or art critic will have a field day. The particular difficulty here is that Brown's puzzle is so delicately intertwined that if even one or two strands are defective, the entire weave becomes highly suspect.<br /><br />To someone yet to read this work, I would simply say that you are facing the doughnuts for supper dilemma. You'll probably love it, so long as you don't mind the heartburn in the morning.rors; a theologian, historian, or art critic will have a field day.

B000286RNY|5.0|this movie combines the beautifulness and revolutionarity of the matrix-esque special effects and the jaw-droppingly great kung fu of the ninja to bring you a masterpiece.  laced with comic relief and well-thought-out plot development this movie is sure to please.   <br /> <br />and at this price, it is seriously a steal.  i'm gonna go buy it for everyone i know for christmas.  hey, if $13 is too much for you, call me up and become my friend by christmas.
1400032717|1.0|I had really high hopes for this book after reading the many online and print reviews.  I've heard from numerous people who loved this book.  I just don't happen to be one of them, I guess. <br /> <br />Ultimately, I do not find Christopher to be a sympathetic character, and the writing style, told first-person from Christopher's POV, is highly irritating.  Almost all of the sentences start with the word \\"And,\\" and it is normal for a sentence to actually be a series of sentences, strung into a very long paragraph that I suppose is meant to represent Christopher's speaking style.  I will still admit that I read this book very quickly, and I was extremely interested in finding out what happened.  However, I can't say I enjoyed this book.  It irritated me far more than it entertained me.  I suppose I should have given Christopher a greater leeway since he is autistic, but I just couldn't muster up enough sympathy for Christopher.
B000286S8S|4.0|This CD really is just a lead-in to the '04 VH US tour, and the new songs were added just to give some folks a reason to buy this at all since Van Halen JUST released a greatest hits CD. However, with the exception of VH3 material, this is a very thorough and comprehensive collection of songs from the entire lifespan of Van Halen. <br />  <br /> I personally prefer Sammy Hagar as a vocalist because he is a better musician and a much more talented singer (MUCH more). No one really can dispute that Sammy's vocal abilities far surpass those of Dave.

B00003CXCT|2.0|The only way I'll buy the Star Wars DVD trilogy is in wide screen with the original release.  I hated his updates and didn't <br />even bother to see the re-release of Jedi, even though it was killer to see it on the big screen as an adult. <br />  I'll just keep my VHS trilogy which is in the original release. <br />And don't get me started on how bad both prequels have been....
B000059XUI|4.0|&quot;With all this accumulative knowledge when are these dummies going to learn to use the doorknob?&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Hi! You should see The White House. They'll be cleaning that for months.&quot; - Lex Luthor does damage control in &quot;Superman II&quot;<br /><br /> The adventures of The Man of Steel continue in a rare sequel that is equal to its original (the same can't be said for &quot;Superman's III & IV&quot;).<br /><br /> While on an undercover assignment for The Daily Planet, Lois Lane & Clark Kent try to uncover a honeymoon scam at Niagra Falls. But, when Lois witnesses Superman save a boy from going over the Falls and certain death, Lois realizes that when ever Supes is around, Clark Kent isn't and vice versa. Lois begins to question whether Clark & Superman are one in the same. Whats worse is when Clark has, what normally would have been, a life altering accident right in front of Lois, revealing his true identity & Lois proclaiming her true love to the Stud of Steel.<br /><br /> Just when things couldn't get any worse, three Kryptonian criminals, that were jailed by Superman's dad in the original film, break free from there eternal prison (The Phantom Zone) and wreak havoc on Earth, destroying anything in their path & eventually ruling the planet. Its up to Superman to take'em down and save the day.<br /><br /> &quot;Superman II&quot; was filmed together with &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; with more than 80% of &quot;II&quot; directed by Richard Donner. Gene Hackman didn't return for the last 20% that was directed by Lester and a stand in was used for additional shots with a voice imitator looping any new dialogue used. The cast is in fine form (this is basically how you can tell these two films were shot together. The cast looks geriatric in &quot;III&quot; & especially in &quot;IV&quot;). There are a lot of effects shots that look old, but, still work to a certain degree. There are tons of product placement in this film (keep a look out during the battle in Metropolis. You will see everything from &quot;KFC&quot;, &quot;Coca-Cola&quot;, & &quot;JVC&quot;, to &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;, &quot;Marlboro&quot; & &quot;Evita&quot;). I also spotted a film flub during the battle in Metropolis. Take special attention right after the bus crash sequence where Superman trys to stop the bus from hitting the Marlboro truck, but, gets hit along with it. There's a quick shot of the crowds stunned reaction. Using your DVD remote freeze the image and look in the background.

B00027JYLC|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this to come out on DVD. I am hoping that the picture quality and sound are good !! It's only 62 minutes but its packed with a great story line and a lot of &quot;freaks&quot;. Remember ..&quot;ONE OF US...ONE OF US&quot; !!!@ If you like cult classics and the &quot;film noir&quot; stuff I also recommend Metropolis restored version ..and Scarlet Street, both by Fritz Lang..although the current versions of Scarlet Street on DVD are not truly restored.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|everyone needs to go easy with the serious reviews. this album was made by fun people having fun making fun music, and we should all be having fun listening to it. if it doesn't make you want to shake your cheeks, there may be no hope left for you. i'm serious, you may want to consult a physician about your lack of joy and unwillingness to have a good time. people who knock this album are the people who go to concerts and stand stock still in the pit, too cool to dance and jam out. if you like gritty, conducive to bum-shaking music, buy this album.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|I was at a party crowded with Americans who had spent time studying abroad, and somehow this movie's title came up, and everyone at the party nodded with a delighted &quot;Ahh yes...&quot; kind of knowing grin, because we all knew without having to articulate it that this film captures 95% of what living and studying in a foreign country is all about. <br />  <br /> Other people have described the plot and characters a bit, so I won't be redundant. I will add, though, that if you're in college or headed to college and you're thinking about studying in a foreign country, SEE THIS FILM! You will most assuredly hit the same highs and lows, and you'll end up having just as much fun and just as many headaches.  <br />  <br /> This movie combines the humor of &quot;Breaking Away&quot; with the cleverness of &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; and has a good-vibe quotient right up there with &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; or &quot;Chariots of Fire.&quot; As a brilliant reviewer below wrote: &quot;This is not your father's foreign film.&quot; It's easy to follow and easy to understand. And it packs a nice little (non-preachy) cultural message or two.  <br />  <br /> Tragic warning: the amazing Audrey Tautou is only on-screen for about 10 or 15 minutes.
B00000254Q|5.0|Santana's multi-cultural genius is captured on this cd. This 1976 release is one of my favorites of all-time. &quot;Dance Sister Dance&quot; is the lead-off song; and what and lively song to start with. This album got a lot of airplay on R & B radio stations in Philly back in '76. Santana's guitar work is superior as usual. &quot;Take Me With You&quot; really smokes and &quot;Gitano&quot; makes you want to dance on the rooftop on a hot steamy summer night!!!
0767817486|1.0|I've seen this movie many years ago, and I watched it last night again. I've still got the same feeling, THIS IS NOT TURKEY. There are hardly any Turkish actors in the movie. Most of the movie wasn't even shot in Turkey. The reviews here made me very upset, more than the movie itself. People have the tendency to judge a country and its entire people based on a movie, which was shot in 1978. Midnight Express is not just a movie. Turkey has been fighting with this image for the whole time.  <br />It is a true story, all right. There are a lot of movies based on true stories in which the moral is all wrong. If you've seen this movie and you think this country is a terrible place, I'd say think again. <br /> <br />1. Criminals are not welcome in any country in the world. If you are a drug dealer, do it in your country.  <br />  <br />2. Time is passing and things change. For countries like Turkey, things get better and better every single day. In this movie, you are looking at a 30-year-old misrepresented image of a country. A lot of things have changed in the last thirty years, the judgemental system and the police have changed all over. Turkey had a huge incentive to change, the EU. And hopefully it will be a member soon.  <br /> <br />3. TURKEY IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY. Believe it or not, it is!!! Turkey's biggest revenue is tourism. If it was that scary, tens of millions of people wouldn't go to Turkey every year. Turkish people are known with their hospitality. They are not some kind of uncivilized monsters, like some critics here and the movie itself have implied.  <br />See the movie if you want, it is a good movie. But don't take anything seriously. I will give one star because it is all wrong. Turkey and Turkish people are nothing like this. <br />
0767817478|4.0|Ok, the old Godzilla was good, but only because it was so bad! The capy effects and cheezy storyplots were hilariouse, but you really only watch the movies to see the monsters wreck buildings and kick each other and send the other flying on a cable. Lets face it, they kinda lose steam by the time they get to....the second one. These movies dont really have any thought, they just make Godzilla vs. some guy over and over again. The movies make a profit because they only take like $200 to make (exaggeration). But these movies are classics none the less and I still love them. <br />  <br /> But I also love the new Godzilla, half the people who hate this movie only do because the critics do. But lets get one thing strait right now, this isn't the old Godzilla movies, it was never intended to be. It is a modern day vision for the average American. The makers of this movie, Devlin and Emmerich, are good (and Independance Day ruled, it had everything, there was absolutely nothing wrong with it, if you hated it, go watch some cheezy chick flick or something, geez even my mother loves this movie, I can't imagine how screwed up you must be). This movie is way more realistic then any of the old Godzilla movies were (common, how many times can Godzilla happen to come by another giant monster, and the movies never follow up on each other)even though this movie was pretty far fetched. Plus, this movie had MORE thought in it then the old ones, the old ones really didn't have much thought put into them, they were just thinkin &quot;hey I have some extra bucks left over from the last godzilla movie, lets make another one, this time we'll make him fight a giant moth&quot; <br />  <br /> This movie had thrilling action scenes no matter what you think (the old ones were more funny then thrilling), amazing effects (no competition from original there, lol), the acting was good most of the time (the old ones had terrible acting). <br />  <br /> So, I close by saying that this was never intended to follow in the old Godzilla's foot steps, the old one was great because it was THE classic monster movie and follows a tradition of bad acting, storyplots [which 50% is an alien invasion and 95% of the time monster(s) vs. monster(s)]. This Godzilla is meant for everyone to enjoy (lets face it, the old Godzilla had a small audience range) and meant to compete with other modern day movies. Many people won't even give this movie a chance, but this movie simply rules!
B00005JMUA|5.0|The first volume was like a video game that focused more on the violence and this one is on the characters as it should be.Quentin blends western,martial art and a love story all in one and it works out perfect.Maybe there isn't as much violence as the first one,but what would be the point?He already did that in the first volume...Great dialogue,acting,music and the whole look makes this one a perfect companion to the first.I just hope that Q.T. puts out a Special Edition like he did with Pulp and Jackie with loads of deleted scenes,interviews;etc. than what's on these 2 volumes.....If there's any justice,I hope that Uma and David get Oscar nominations for their acting..BUY THIS!!!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I first heard Gavin Degraw on a tv talk show and was captivated by his wonderfully soulful singing talent. That same day I went out and bought his first debut cd Chariot and i fell in love with it! So of coarse, I was ecstatic to hear of the &quot;re-release&quot;,of the cd and was counting down the days until it hit stores. As soon as, I popped Chariot Stripped into the player I became mesmerised all over again, by the same amazing voice with some slightly different brilliant music. Gavin DeGraw is truely a greatly stunning music artist of our time!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I've loved Josh's music since I first heard him on the radio then on the Concert for World Children's day about a year and a half ago. His first CD was great, and &quot;Closer&quot; is even better. I own both the Regular Edition of it and the Limited Edition. I'm still trying to get a hold of the Fan Only Internet Edition and from what I've heard about it, the money is well worth it. I love him and his music.
0380820846|4.0|Penelope Featherington is not a &quot;diamond of the first water&quot; she's not young and sought after and eyelash flutteringly innocent. Thank goodness! No, she's 28, a spinster and has never received a single proposal. <br />  <br /> Colin Bridgerton is a handsome rogue and he knows it. He's charming and the ladies love him but he feels at a loose end. His brothers have purpose in life but he feels that he's got nothing. His return to England after so much travel has left him wanting something but not knowing what.  <br />  <br /> Of course, if you've read the other books in the series you know that Penelope has been in love with Colin since she was 16 and that he likes her but has always felt sorry for her. This all changes when he begins to see that there's more to Penelope than meets the eye. <br />  <br /> That's really what made me like this book so much, that the female lead isn't a blushing virgin, she's smart and witty and the handsome rakish male isn't some dominating force. I like their chemistry.
B00008EY65|4.0|HELLBOY [Ron Perlman, John Hurt, Selma Blair, Rupert Evans / Directed by Guillermo del Toro / 122 minutes / Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and frightening images]<br /><br />When I was a kid, my parents were adamant that we not read comic books. My cousins, who lived a couple of miles away, got to read them, but they couldn't go to any movie that wasn't rated G. My siblings and I got to see almost any movie. Looking back, I think we got the better deal. Our horizons were broadened through film far more than by reading comic books.<br /><br />When it comes to movies based on these books, I can see them only as movies, since I don't have much knowledge of the source material. I can't tell you how faithful \\"Hellboy\\" is to its comic book origins, but I can tell you it's an inventive, energetic movie.<br /><br />This dark comic fable begins near the end of World War II. The German Nazi high command, knowing it is about to lose the war, launches and effort to bring forth The Forces of Evil. The plan is intercepted by The Allies just in time by a commando squad. The one demon raised by the Nazis, Hellboy [Ron Perleman], is taken into custody. Raised in a secret location in the United States by the leader of the commandos, Hellboy learns to be a force for good. In the present day, all hell breaks loose, so to speak, and only Hellboy can save the planet from the forces of darkness.<br /><br />In translating to a movie, a comic book is no different from a literary masterpiece. To be successful, the movie has to succeed on its own terms. Having not read the original, be it `high' art or `low', shouldn't be an encumbrance to liking and understanding the film. \\"Hellboy' succeeds brilliantly.
B00004YTIQ|4.0|Despite the reviews above, I thought this pool cover worked really well for the pool it is designed to cover. I had no problem keeping bugs and rainwater out of our pool and it provided great solar heat, warming the pool to wonderfully warm temps! I have had this pool cover for 2 summers and it is holding up wonderfully. Our biggest problem is keeping our pool from deflating. We have gone through 4 pools in 2 summers. This years pool just deflated once again.

0066214122|4.0|Prey is a chilling thriller about microscopic machines produced by nanotechnology. As a scientist, I was aware of nanotechnology, but I thought Crichton was stretching it a bit, until the latest issue of Science landed in my mailbox with a multipage discussion of rapid advances in nanotechnology. Thus, Prey is a great piece of suspense based on a fast-moving area of science. The plot is simple. Jack Forman, an unemployed,  computer expert suspects that his wife, a vice president of a high-tech firm, is having an affair. He gets an urgent call to consult with the same firm, and the suspense begins. The company has developed microscopic particles, half-machine and half-living matter, for covert, military observation. But the nanoparticles have gotten loose, swarmed, and learned to survive by feeding on animals or humans. The company, located in the desert, becomes besieged by the particles. Things get worse in a satisfying manner. My only criticism is that Crichton felt the need to intersperse explanations of nanotechnology throughout the story, interrupting its flow. But that is a small problem in an exciting tale that is well-worth reading.
B000268QB2|2.0|Keane's new album is only trying to mimic those who have preceded them (Coldplay, Travis). They do not, as Rolling Stone puts it, &quot;[reconfigure] the high-romantic aesthetic introduced by Radiohead and mainstreamed by Coldplay as the launchpad for a serious hookfest.&quot; Despite the two opening tracks, they fail to do anything that their predecessors do. They lack the depth and intrigue of these superior acts. Their tracks are all alike in their mediocrity and inane routineness. They fail to evoke the feeling and emotion that is necessary to fuel this genre of slow, reflective Britpop. This is why hopefully, following their undeserved hype, they will fade to obscurity...God willing.
B00005JN2F|2.0|I absolutely loved the Bourne Identity and eagerly anticipated this film.  I read several reviews of this film and they all said the same things, the camera shots and the editing of the action scenes were disjointed and shaky and hard to follow.<br /><br />I believe it was Roger Ebert who said the action scenes were something you just had to wait through to get back to the good part of the movie.  Because most of the movie is great.  Damon is exciting as the mysterious Bourne who outmaneuvers the CIA that is trying to kill him because they believed he killed some of their agents.<br /><br />I enjoyed the spy aspects of this thriller as Bourne tries to find the traitor in the CIA that betrayed him.  But, this film has really few twists and turns and everything turns out to be straight forward.  I don't know how Damon knew who the CIA bad guy was, but he just shows up in his hotel room.  The Russian bad guys seem to be an afterthought, yet the final chase scene is with a Russia hitman.<br /><br />After that chase scene I settled back in to enjoy the rest of the movie, when with a sad shock I realized the movie was probably almost over and I had just witnessed the climax.<br /><br />The biggest dissappointment between the two films is the action scenes.  Bourne Identity thrilled with suspenseful scenes relevant to the plot that stood out because of their lack of computer generated effects.  Bourne 2 action scenes are choppy and disjointed and confusing, and that makes all the difference in the world.
0694013013|5.0|My 2 year old knows this book and loves this book. She knows what the next page will say before I can turn the page. She loves copying the actions of the animals and my wife laughs whenever she acts like a monkey. It is a nice book for young children.
B00008GKEG|5.0|At 11 years old, my biggest interests were horses, painting and drawing horses, reading books about horses and avoiding homework. Then, one November Sunday night, I wanted to watch tv and there was nothing on but The Beatles Anthology, I was too lazy to turn the set off. AND IT'S A GOOD THING I DIDN'T!!! At the end of two hours, I was off to bed singing &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and begging to watch the second installment the night it came on. It was heartbreak when I missed the 3rd and final installment on Thanksgiving night but by Christmas, I was 12 years old and the proud owner of my first boombox and my first CD ever: The Beatles Anthology 1.<br /><br /> That was 9 years ago and I'm even crazier about The Beatles than I was then. I've even converted my best friends and my latest boyfriend into Beatles fans! It was also interesting to see my parents watching the local news the next night and seeing literally HUNDREDS of teenagers lined up outside the music stores in the Mall to buy Beatles albums!<br /><br /> Oh, and don't get me wrong, I still love my horses (I'm training them now) and am pursuing an art career in college, I still love to read (I have several books about The Beatles) and am now trying to write a novel; but my love of The Beatles has never faded. The airing of The Beatles Anthology unleashed a second tide of Beatlemania that has yet to fade. In fact, they are still among the Top Ten searches on ebay. The Beatles also ignited my love of 60's and 70's music and culture and I am now among the hundreds of 20-somethings on my campus who are the latest of worshippers at the altars of the likes of: Jimmy Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin and the solo career of John Lennon. We can now find common ground with the Baby Boomer/Old Hippy Professors on our campus and, even our parents!<br /><br /> Ah, but back to my story. In my 13th year, The Beatles Anthology aired AGAIN, proof of its undying popularity. This time, I was prepared, and had enough VHS tape to record all three nights, sans commercials. My allowance, sadly, was not large enough to purchase the whole set of VHS tapes and my parents deemed them too expensive for a present. So, I continued to watch my home recordings as they faded more and more from continual use. Then, (hallelujah!) the DVDs were released! I was finally able to see the Anthology in its entirety, and for a much better price than the $130 out-of-publication VHS tapes.<br /><br /> This set is NOT a letdown! And, it has the added bonus of extra material (the video for &quot;Real Love&quot;, behind the scenes production, etc.) that the VHS tapes didn't have. The story of how The Beatles came to be is a real inspiration for me. I love the tale of how they all came to know each other and it was very interesting to learn of their backgrounds, the music that influenced each of them, how they got their name (like the Crickets, but Beat, like Beat Music) and the truly HORRIBLE living and traveling conditions they had to endure (broken windshield while traveling down a highway in the middle of winter in leather clothes, the horrible accommodations when they first arrived in Hamburg, and other stories). Their climb to success was long, hard and at times, disgruntling. But by the time John was 24, they were in America and loved all over the world!<br /><br /> The Beatles had 27 Number One Hits in the space of SIX years! That is UNPRESIDENTED! Plus, they occupied the top FIVE spots of the Hits chart all at once, a record that had never happened before or since. Even when the Anthology aired, for weeks before, ABC broadcasting was advertising their station as &quot;A Beatle C&quot;, even the local news anchors were being interviewed about who their favorite Beatle was. And, in the Friday Night programs called TGIF, their regular theme songs were replaced with BEATLES songs! I mean, no one band must be bigger, more famous or more loved to deserve all that hype! And I must say, I believe in that statement.<br /><br /> The Beatles have influenced my artwork (just hearing their music brings all kinds of WONDERFUL abstract images into my head), like John Lennon always did, I now dream in Technicolor, and also like him, I don't need drugs to do it! He stated that it was always like that for him, he didn't know any other way to dream and at that point, he hadn't ever touched drugs. And despite their drug use, you have to respect The Beatles, they never used while they were recording (except once by accident) so even their was always done sober. AND, they give me hope that I WILL be able to make it with my own brand of art, the key is to NEVER give up on what you love to do, NO MATTER *WHAT* ANYONE TELLS YOU! (ex. John's Aunt Mimi: &quot;You'll never make a living playing a guitar, John.&quot;)<br /><br /> But, honestly, this is a GREAT set, The Beatles are a fantastic, original and NEVER-outdated band. They were the Four Horsemen of the 60's, they changed and influenced that decade in too many ways to name, they influenced the course of ALL genres of music forever, and they were always on the cutting edge of ingenuity, creativity and originality. Their sound was so NEW and Different from anything ever heard before, OR since! And because of that, their music will always remain TIMELESS and in a class ALL its own.at statement. <br />  <br /> The Beatles have influenced my artwork (just hearing their music brings all kinds of WONDERFUL abstract images into my head), like John Lennon always did, I now dream in Technicolor, and also like him, I don't need drugs to do it!

B00005JMX6|5.0|It's the best movie I have ever seen. Funy, sexy, has a great storyline, great acting performance, what else could you want?
B00003XB8K|5.0|It is very interesting to discover the prevalent Carmina Burana thread to this work - despite no mention of this on the sleeve. Obviously a bold and potentially disastrous move - interweaving one's own work through this monumental thread - is pulled off with aplomb by Michael Cretu, aka Enigma. These songs are mysterious, deeply moving and varied. Overall, this guy is still at the bleeding edge of trance/pop/new age m&eacute;lange and his keen vision justifies the usurping of one of the most amazing pieces of classical music ever heard. He took a risk and made it work.
B00005AQGH|5.0|<br /> The last album that 2Pac, under the alias of Makaveli, made while he was alive. Its an amazing end too, one of the best hes ever done, tied only with All Eyez On Me. <br /> He takes the name of a Italian philospher who faked his death, and returned seven days later to take revenge on his enemies. This, along with Pacs death right before the release of this album, lead people to believe that he was still alive, and that he would eventually return. <br />  <br /> The music itself is really good, Pac gets more spiritual than he's ever been before, with cuts like Hail Mary, and Blashemy, but keeps his gangsta style on Life Of An Outlaw, and To Live And Die In LA. <br />  <br /> The best songs on here are Bomb First (My Second Reply), Hail Mary, To Live And Die In LA,  <br /> (And my personal favorites:) Life Of An Outlaw, Me and My Girlfriend. <br /> All the others are really good as well, but those are the stand out tracks. <br />  <br /> Life Of An Outlaw, Me and My Girlfriend are really amazing songs. <br /> In my opinion, they should have put on the Greatest Hits collection, but whatever... <br />  <br /> The Outlawz are once again on Pacs (excuse me, Makveli's) album. <br /> I really, really like the Outlawz, I think they are a great rap group. A new member makes his debut on this album, Young Noble. He has his own, distinct style of rapping. He raps like he has a swollen tongue, but he is pretty good, and he has stuck around with the group ever since this album. <br />  <br /> I, personally, believe that he is really dead, and people should let him rest in peace, but those who believe this only do so out of love for him.  <br /> Dead or not, he's still the greatest rapper ever. <br /> R.I.P... <br />  <br /> P.S- Oh yeah, About the &quot;Suge shot me&quot;, Im pretty sure Pac wasn't the one that said that. Most of that stuff was added to get people to think he was still alive. <br /> Like the executive producer being &quot;Simon&quot;, not Suge Knight, thefingerprints in the booklet, etc. <br />
B000089RVX|5.0|Okay, the cover was freaky....... but later someday in MTV after seeing the Bring me to Life video..... I knew I had to get it!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Turned out, like any other great album (to me), this one has 6 SUPERB Songs, others are okay....... <br /> <br />1. Going under - It was ghostly, but her voice was revealed slowly, that's what made me like it. 10/10! <br /> <br />2. BRING ME TO LIFE - The Best song, not only in the album, but in 2003! 10 out of 10!!!!!!! <br /> <br />3. Everybody's Fool - The openning sucked a bit, but this song turned out to be good.

B00005TT77|4.0|and I still love it. I love the Beatles. I believe their songs are wonderful and should be sung by as many artists as possible. It's great to hear other artists interpretation of such famous songs. The words are worthy of hearing and this album is worthy of listening to.
B0000024ZT|3.0|<br />With the rambling, stream of consciousness lyrics on GREETINGS you can feel Springsteen pressing a bit. For every wondrous street poem like \\"Spirit in the Night,\\" or \\"Lost in the Flood,\\" you have the odd imagery of \\"Mary Queen of Arkansas,\\" or the rather bizarre rambling of \\"The Angel,\\" a song that seems interminable and it only clocks in at 3:23. There are definitely enough wonderful songs here to see the potential, but some of it is just a bit ponderous and has not aged well. Still, it definitely has its merits and is well worth your time to hear how one of America's greatest rockers began his career. <br /> <br />
B00005JLEU|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie! I have never seen anime before, and actually my little cousins were the ones who told me to see it. They are a 7 year old girl and a 9 year old boy, and were big fans of Spirited Away. My Aunt and Uncle too. I am 19 and am now crazy about it too! So, it's good for many different ages.
B000002NBY|5.0|It's pretty rare that I gush in these reviews, but for me, this album is a truly marvelous creation. The buoyant rhythms of the South African music scene combined with Simon's truly creative lyrics are a wonderful combination of whimsy and significance. From the topical \\"Boy in the Bubble\\" to the participation of Los Lobos on \\"The Myth of Fingerprints,\\" there is not a misfire on this recording. Even \\"You Can Call Me AL,\\" is a delightful number when you separate it from the novelty video.   With the participation of bands like Ladysmith Black Mambazo and others who play \\"township jive\\" Simon's music is given added authenticity. In Simon's long and storied career, GRACELAND is perhaps his finest work, an incredible synthesis of pop sensibilities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000931QA|5.0|Yes, I'll say the best ever and stand behind that statement to the death. This album has never gotten old for me. Even after 16 years I still throw this in the CD player a few times a year. Not only is the story awesome and very tight (other reviewers have made good note of this) but the musicianship is top notch.        Queensryche accomplished what they set out to do: they made the quintessential rock opera to stand the test of time. This is easily the best album Queensryche ever made followed by Empire. No one (not even themselves) has been able to come close to it. This is a must have for any prog metal or just metal head. Great songwriting and excellent musicians.        This is the kind of album that you never want to end. Every song is a winner and by the time you get to the climax ending of Eyes Of A Stranger you're wanting to start the whole thing over again. You feel like you've lived and died with the characters in the story and if you're a guitar player you're wanting to get home to play along.        Can't say enough about this album. It's just simply the best ever!!!
B000002LKF|2.0|After the incredible success of GRACELAND, Simon returns to his investigation of cross cultural pop with this look at the music of Brazil. The problem is it is far less satisfying in its execution. The music does not have the bite that was found on GRACELAND it tends to meander and lacks the strength of rhythm found on GRACELAND. Lyrically there are no real standouts; one song seems to drift into another without leaving anything more than a faint trace on your memory. It really works wells as new age background music, but that's really not what I want when I get a Paul Simon recording.
B00003CX9S|5.0|David Lynch has signed his masterpiece in the story of the cinema with this splendid and towering movie .<br /><br />A sad and poignant film about a deformed man employed for an unscrupulous mercenary as a freak attraction , he will be rescued from this unending nightmare and he will prove the whole world that behind that uggly face it lives a human being , He is not an animal , reminds Hurt to the irrational crowd in an awful chase sequence as he was a beast .<br /><br />Why did not John Hurt win all the possible prizes in the world for this titanic and unique performance ? It is just a mistery .<br /><br />The film still keeps its expressive force and charm .<br /><br />Bancroft and Hopkins are in the top . Superb edition , scorching direction , beautifully filmed in glorious black and white .<br /><br />A timeless winner film.

B00005JKZV|4.0|Maybe it's the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; overtones that make this sequel leagues better than the original &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot;, which when I saw it in a theatre, came across as a bloated, mundane overdose of fantasy. Here in the domestic comfort of my living room, the DVD of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; offers an easy-going storyline that this adult always remained interested in, action that doesn't rival the tackiness of World Wrestling, and a dark visual atmosphere with less sun-god like glaring computer generated graphics than the blinding original. Speaking of computers, the little mostly naked guy with the nervous tick who guides the hobbits on their adventure had an achingly real oppressive acting style. The real actors here can at least be assured there is no threat to their profession. The hobbits themselves seemed much less like &quot;Snow White&quot; rejects and more genuine was the bond between them. The main swashbuckler dude seemed cautious of the camera while the long haired blonde Scandanavian guy was much more assured and seemed to be a real hero from Middle Earth. Loved the basic electricity look of the 'two towers', and one wonders how our own real satelite atmosphere compares. I couldn't help but wonder if this film preceded 9/11 and how much attention was given to the irony. Oh, and those tree people were much less animated than the trees in my own yard.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I really liked this movie. However, I couldn't give it a five because I'm a sucker for &quot;happy endings&quot;. With the theatrical cut, you can sit around and try to convince yourself that somewhere later down the road, Evan and Caley will meet again. Doubt it but hey - it could happen. However, the director's cut left no such possibility - it was downright disturbing.<br /><br /> This doesn't take away from a very unique movie. I was captivated by the storyline within the first five minutes. If for nothing more, you continue to watch it to see how Evan's next &quot;leap&quot; will affect the lives of those around him.<br /><br /> I was impressed by Ashton Kutcher's acting in this movie, as well. I haven't seen anything else he's done besides &quot;Punk'd&quot; but I think he did a darn good job in this movie.<br /><br /> As always, my recommendation is to rent before you buy. However, if you're a parent...let me just give you this bit of parenting advice: &quot;IT'S RATED R FOR A REASON!!!&quot;
B000286S8S|1.0|Who are these reviewers? Ignore the bad reviews!  If people don't mind parting with their hard earned cash to buy repeat records with a different cover then what are they on?  The DLR era made Van Halen what it is now.  They may never of been heard of it if weren't for DLR.  Sammy (bleach heard old whining git) Hagar's career would be over now if it weren't for VH.  The Hagar era is mediocre at best. The new tracks on this record suck.  Thankfully I have never bought a record from their Hagar era.  This record stands up to the 5150 studio name, because with DLR it's 51% fantastic and with Hagar it's 50% crap.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I became addicted to Gavin DeGraw after borrowing a copy of my friend's &quot;Chariot&quot; album. The moment I heard that raw, soulful voice sing the first few lyrics of &quot;Follow Through&quot;, I was hooked. I immediately bought the Chariot album, and when I found out that it was being re-releasead with live recordings and a new track, I knew that I would be getting a new version of an old favorite. Gavin DeGraw is onejust of the most fantastic artists I have ever heard. His vocals and lyrics are so unique and his songs leave me absolutely mesmerized. Chariot Stripped is an absolutely amazing album and I urge everyone to purchase a copy and go see a Gavin DeGraw show if you ever get the opportunity!!
B00020X88O|4.0|This film was slaughtered by critics when it came out and apparently its still criticized heavily today. I personally love the movie. I disagree with it being called a smut film. This is far from those cheesy cinemax late night flicks. And I don't get why some people are complaining about the nudity. What in the world did they think they were going to watch? The movie is called SHOWGIRLS and revolved around the backstage drama of ...you guessed it! Topless showgirls! I certainly don't recall any Mickey Mouse logos in the movie trailer. I think too many people expected way too much from this. If you just want to be entertained with a movie, and you don't mind language and nudity, then get this film. It also probably won't hurt if you liked Elizabeth from Saved By the Bell. Aside from the drama, I found this movie to be very comedic in many parts. Sometimes I laughed WITH the movie such as the classic mispronunciation of 'Versace'. And then sometimes I laughed AT the movie such as Elizabeth's weird dancing, her sometimes bad acting, or her thrashing around in a swimming pool which was supposed to be sexy but I couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous it looked (you'll see what I mean when you watch it). And the film definitely had strong dramatic moments towards the end of the film as well. Just in case you haven't actually seen it, I won't spoil it for you, but let me say the packed theater audience unanimously applauded and cheered for Elizabeth during this particular scene (That doesn't sound like a bored audience to me). To sum up the review, this movie was treated unfairly by critics. I liked this movie alot more than The English Patient, Monster's Ball, Philadelphia and some other critically acclaimed films. It just depends on your taste.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I only gave this thing one star because I'm still not sure if this is the trilogy of the original eps.4-6 from the 70's or the crappy &quot;special edition&quot; aka &quot;let's mess up the movies with some hi-tech special effects crap&quot; from the mid 90's. Could SOMEONE please clear that up for me? If it's the originals then I'm most definitley buying this thing. Thanks! ^_^
B00005QG9J|5.0|I def. think this is Incubus' best album yet. I absolutely love what they did musically on this album. I love it so much i prob. would buy the instrumental version if they had one. Morning View to me is a masterpiece. And Brandon's vocals and lyrics are amazing and exactly on point. Every song on this cd exceeds its satisfaction. Every one really needs to check this cd out beacuase it's just soo wonderful to listen to.
B00008EY65|5.0|When I saw previews of the film a while back, I thought this film would be a total joke. Little did I know that it was based off of a comic book series that I never heard of and that it would become one of the years greatest films (in my opinion at least).<br /><br />Guillermo Del Torro an excellent job with HellBoy. I loved his Blade II and was surprised that, when I bought the DVD, that he also directed this film! So when I found that out, I knew the film had to be good. After watching it, the film has made me into a HellBoy fan. The films is very action-packed and moves along at a very reasonable pace. The story itself is original and very entertaining.<br /><br />I really don't have much criticism for the film other than I wished Abe Sapien had gotten involved in the final battle and that the Seven God demons/monsters would have actually attacked the earth. But I guess they have to save something for sequels right?<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this film and am very pleased to put it alongside my other DVDs in my collection! The film has great special effects, an entertaining story, action-packed battle sequences, and a pace that makes the film flow smoothly. HellBoy deserves all five stars!
B000000WA4|5.0|Smashing Pumpkins are definitely my favorite band of all time. There is just somethin about them that is different from every band in the nineties and that attracted me. Some people say that Siamese Dream was their best album but when Mellen Collie and the infinite sadness came out I fell in love with it. With Tonight Tonight I just felt that they had broadened their perspective on music in such a good way and I feel this way about the whole cd. And I find myself saying one word everytime I listen to it...WOW!! This is defintiely a classic and essential recording.
B00005JN2F|4.0|Two years ago, (...) when The Bourne Identity turned out to be a good movie and The Sum of All Fears, well, sucked. He's back in full force with the sequel, part two of three, a movie that not only improves on the original but really sets the bar high for the third and final film. In the able hands of director Paul Greengrass, the movie whips and whirs along with the thrill of great storytelling, great action sequences, and really great acting. Case in point: Joan Allen. I loved her in The Contender, thought she was one of the best things about The Notebook, but she enters the realm of 'Oscar Contender' here for her fierce, engaging portrayal of Pamela Landy, easily one of the strongest female supporting roles to come along in a while. But let's not forget Matt Damon, either; he brings a complexity to a role that could have been a cardboard cut-out instead.              And I don't know if it's just me, but the action scenes in Supremacy tower above the first film, as well. Greengrass has wisely chosen to shoot the movie with many, many setups on action scenes, and handheld cameras throughout. Just about every violent moment in the movie ranges from engrossing to flat out pants-pissing exciting, and only in a huge car chase at the end of the film does it cross that ever-so-thin line of plausibility. Is The Bourne Supremacy a masterpiece of spy-thriller moviemaking? Nah, not really. But these kinds of movies are a dime a dozen lately, and when one as technically assured and extremely well-acted as Bourne hits screens, it's obvious that it's worth every penny of those 7 bucks. GRADE: B+
B0001AP12G|5.0|Damn!!!! Kanye West put hip hop back where it should be. This is arguably one of the best records of 2004 if not the best. Already one of the best producers out right now, Kanye drops this classic which is filled wit hot beats and dope lyrics. The best song on the album is arguably Jesus Walks. So much controversy and sooo much intelligence. Everyone needs to check this one out right now.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|Among past and present Offspring fans, the quartet's 1998 release Americana has long been a controversial topic. While the album was a huge success and helped restore the band's following (although with a younger crowd), many old-school Offspring fans complained about the CD's poppy sound and accused the group of &quot;selling out&quot;. Personally, I find these complaints very short-sighted, and I don't fault the Offspring for changing their sound. Every good band needs to evolve somewhat over time, and I think the Offspring have done so remarkably well.      While I slightly prefer Ignition and Smash to Americana, I like this CD a lot because of its diversity and great songs. The album starts off with two excellent, classic Offspring songs - Have You Ever and Staring at the Sun. Tunes like these are what the group has become known for - fast-paced, energetic, catchy rock. Next comes Pretty Fly for a White Guy, an irresistible, Latin-tinged pop-rock track that scored huge with the MTV crowd back in 1998. Other notable songs include the awesome, anthemic rocker Kids Aren't Alright (as a side note, this was the first song the group played at the WBCN River Rave in Mansfield, MA on May 30, 2004, which I was happily able to attend); the peppy Walla Walla, which has a great sing-along chorus; Why Don't You Get a Job, a funny and extremely catchy track; the kick-ass title track, Americana; and the 8-minute closer Pay the Man - possibly the Offspring's most ambitious song ever, it starts off as a creepy ballad with an Egyptian-sounding guitar, but halfway through erupts into a fist-pumping rocker.      Anyway, Americana is an excellent offering from the Offspring. True, it is their poppiest record, but almost all of the songs are great and very enjoyable. All in all, Americana is a high-spirited, energetic rock album, and is well worth picking up.
B00006ZXSK|4.0|Ever After is a take on the Cinderella story that is delightful and memorable.  Except for the ending (really, who wouldn't guess that the prince and Cinderella come together?), the rest of the movie is full of unexpected moments that move you and make you laugh.  For example: <br /> <br />1) In what other movie do you have Leonardo Da Vinci as the fairy godmother? (or godfather, I guess...) <br /> <br />2) The heroine can actually hold her own against dangerous people and rescue the prince when he needs rescuing (in what is one of the movie's funniest moments).  Also, she's intelligent, and it shows.  She and the prince have real conversations about interesting topics (not like the empty chatter that's common in other romances).  And though the prince is quite an endearing guy, smart and sensitive (if not a little moody), it's the heroine who teaches him true strength of character. <br /> <br />3) Anjelica Huston is marvelous as the wicked stepmother.  There are moments when you see some heart in her, or a troubled mind, and then watch as she quickly conceals the vulnerability and returns to being her cruel, hard self. <br /> <br />4) One of the wicked stepsisters isn't so wicked after all... <br /> <br />There's more of course; Ever After is a wonderful fairy tale that has a lot of heart. <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|I bet that eventually Lucas will get so greedy as to release a version with the movies as they should be. When this happens people will end up paying for yet another set. If you buy this be prepared for a messed up movie, and to end up paying for it again in a couple years.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|In my review for Avril's first album, I wrote, &quot;This is the best CD I've ever listened to in my life. Avril is *almost* your average 17-year-old punk. The only difference? Her amazing talent.&quot; My opinion changed a bit after seeing her live. She only played guitar on 2 or 3 songs, and her voice must've been altered a lot on the CD, because it didn't sound that good in concert. <br />  <br /> However, I've bought &quot;Under My Skin&quot; and I have to admit that Avril's done it again--she's convinced me that she's awesome. Unlike with her first album, she wrote or co-wrote all of the songs. They're more angry, and they rock harder than the ones on the first album; those songs are more upbeat and pop-ish. Even though she only plays guitar on one song, whoever's doing it does a pretty good job. Also, Ben Moody, formerly from Evanescence, plays guitar on &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;, which I thought was pretty cool. <br />  <br /> It's hard for me to pick which songs I like the best, because they are all so good. I think anyone can relate to the lyrics on this one. Most of them are about a break-up with a guy. For the people who are complaining about that, like &quot;Your Doom 'Beware' &quot;, I think writing about a breakup is a good way of taking out bad feelings about it. I don't see why it's so bad that most of her songs are probably about the same guy. It's not boring to me at all. Also, if you don't like her, why did you spend money on the album? The words might be simple because she's still young and hasn't had a lot of experience writing lyrics. It's idiotic how people don't understand that musicians are still human. <br />  <br /> Also, she might sound like Michelle Branch, Evanescence, or a female version of Dashboard Confessional, but I don't think any band or artist is going to not sound like another band or artist. Pick any band--I'm sure there's another one that sounds a least a little bit like it. <br />  <br /> I think anyone who likes music willlike this album, unless they are really against angry or heartfelt songs.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Several reviewers have complained of this not living up to the hype.  Well, what could?  I've read reviews that call it 'one of the ages.'  That's ridiculous.  When The O.C. crowd moves on to the next big thing, FF will lose some of its momentum. <br /> <br />And that's okay. <br /> <br />This is one to enjoy.  FF doesn't try hard to make a statement (e.g. Hives) or start a movement (e.g. Strokes).  I'm fans of both those bands, but this is not that.  This is period music in the spirit of The Pet Shop Boys, Duran Duran, New Order, and even a little Smiths tossed in for good measure.  Not a ripoff, but there are recognizable influences if you were a fan.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for one for the ages, look elsewhere.  But for a lovechild of pop music lineage from the past, it's worth a listen.  <br /> <br />
0606022945|4.0|That word, &quot;factitious,&quot; according to Sylvia Plath, was used by one of her creative writing professors to characterize one of her submissions, &quot;The big weekend.&quot; I doubt he would read anything &quot;factitious&quot; into The Bell Jar. If anything, Ms. Plath takes pains to ensure that readers understand the depth of her psychological pain in a prose that can be vivid, even stunning. My one problem is that her own self-loathing overwhelms all else; by the novel's end, her biting sarcasm and stubborn bitterness had begun to grate. Still, there is no doubt that she demonstrates in this book the mastery of her craft, a mastery even more apparent in her poetry. I strongly recommend this novel; both its weakness and its extrodinary strengths are instructive. What a loss she was...
B00007L4MJ|5.0|BRIGITTE HELM is brilliant in this spectacular event - restored by the FW MURNAU foundation - and pristine in its presentation and timely impact - especially regarding Corporations and World Domination.<br /><br /> So, here we have it - a tale of what lies beneath [the silent workers] and the idle rich - totally unaware of what exactly is keeping their luxuries afloat. [Amazing Art and Costume design - so explicit in detail!]<br /><br /> This one's been seen so many times it defies description, but this authorized restored versiion gives us a glimpse into the original and what it was like when first released.<br /><br /> Mythology, progress [a century since the Industrial revolution] Man & Machine - and the glorious Maria ..... then there's the robot too!<br /><br /> Frankensietn is slightly more gothic, but a lot was 'borrowed' from this one - even Elsa Lancaster's bird like twitching as 'the Bride' - Helm does it all - vamp, virgin, seductress, savior, fully clothed, almost nude ......<br /><br /> Vary odd Arnold S. lookalike - playing &quot;The Thin Man&quot; - a corporate henchman?<br /><br /> BRAVO KINO!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This has to be one of the best shows ever. I never saw it when it ran on Fox(I hadn't even heard about it). I was suffering from Buffy & Angel withdrawals and was looking for ANYTHING by Joss. I saw this -- hmmm -- sci-fi and western? Then I started to read the reviews and decided to buy the thing. Was I ever blow away. I stayed up after 1 am in the morning every night to watch this set. I came home from work and that is all I did -- watch firefly until I had completed it. The cast is superb - glad to see Adam Baldwin again as the funny, not too trustworthy Jayne, Gina Torres as Zoe is wonderful as the strong Amazon woman married to the &quot;semi-large muscular man&quot;, Wash. Ron Glass as Book is great and I wanted to know more about him and why does he know so much about weapons? It had so much promise -- what was Fox thinking of? I hope that executive got canned for losing this show & family guy. <br /> I have loaned this out to several friends and they have all converted and are just as confused as I am about the cancellation of this series. I was thrilled to find out that this will be a movie; but I want this back as a TV series, so I can get a weekly fix. Lets hope that a cable channel will pick this up!  <br /> Love, love, love this series -- the only disappointing thing is that there are no more dvd's to watch once you go thru the 14 eps. <br />
B00008EY65|4.0|Hellboy (Ron Perlman), a demon, was brought to earth through a dimension portal at the final year of World War II when he was an infant as the Nazi's desperately attempted to find a way to win the war.  However, the Nazi's failed to get their hands on Hellboy as the Allies brought him to the United States to fight paranormal crimes.  Sixty years later Hellboy has to face prejudice because of his demonic looks in world that is not ready to accept characters such as Hellboy and his companion Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), an aquatic being.  Thus, Hellboy and Abe Sapien have joined forces with the FBI as they help protect a world unaware of their existence.<br /><br />Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm (John Hurt) discovered and nurtured Hellboy as his own son, which has brought out the sensitive side of Hellboy.  However, when Hellboy is not in contact with his sensitive side he is as cool and reckless as a small God should be as he goes about smacking down monsters and other demonic creatures in order to protect mankind.  Broom also has a terminal disease that prevents him from continuing to manage the organization in which Hellboy and Abe Sapien work.  This has led Broom to acquire a young FBI agent, John Myers (Rupert Evans), to be his successor as he believes he has the tools to keep Hellboy in balance with himself.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro creates an in-your-face cinematic experience with Hellboy, which is based on the comic book, Hellboy.  It is inspiring that Hellboy has been filmed in the true sense of a comic book as it is lightheartedly switching between action, comedy, and a melodramatic love triangle.  This does not hurt the cinematic experience, but instead elevates it to a pleasant cinematic event where good fights evil.  At the end, Hellboy is a must see for comic book readers, superhero fans, but also anyone else who enjoys a warm action packed journey.
038551123X|4.0|I read this last night, having asked the library to order it after seeing several mentions in &quot;2004 Summer Books&quot; lists around the web.<br /><br /> Here's the thing -- there was a time, years ago, when I read serial killer books ravenously. Kellerman(s), Patterson, Cornwell, you name it. Finally, I realized that they were giving me a warped view of the world, not to mention causing me nightmares. So I went cold turkey on the genre, in favor of reading that was a little more positive, or at least true-to-life.<br /><br /> But when I heard about this book -- a serial killer novel in which the protagonist is himself a serial killer (that's not a spoiler, BTW) -- I couldn't resist. And I'm glad I didn't.<br /><br /> Dexter Morgan is a blood-spatter specialist for the Miami police. He's super-intelligent, excellent at his job, well-liked by most of his coworkers, and even has a girlfriend. He's also a complete sociopath and a serial killer. The upside of this is that he uses his unusual experience to subtly aid the police department find others of his kind.<br /><br /> I don't want to spoil it by revealing the plot, so I'll just say that it's written in the first person, and Dexter is remarkably funny and sympathetic, while also being deeply and fundamentally broken. The gore in the novel is implied and not very graphic -- the main themes in this book are more about motivations and impulses than the killings themselves.<br /><br /> It read quickly, and it's not great literature. The external dialogue was the weakest (almost laughable in places); the strongest parts were when Dexter talked about his own unique take on being what he is. But I recommend it as a fun take on a well-worn genre. Grade: B.
0452282152|5.0|I have to admit it took me a while to get into this book, but once you get sucked in that's it there's no going back. I think that this book is so alluring because the characters are so rich and you just understand everything and you can relate to these very realistic characters. My sister has the movie and I hope it can live up to the book!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Initially I rejected this FM CD even without listening to it, due to the absence of Christine. I listened a couple of times \\" Peacekeeper\\" on radio, but I really don't like it so much (and still don't). I'm a great fan of FM Rumours era, and for me, any incarnation of FM without Christine, Stevie and Lindsey, it was almost like a sacrilege.  <br />  <br /> Nevertheless FM Live in Boston called my attention by the renewed versions of the old classics like \\"Never Coming Back Again\\" or \\"Beautiful Child\\", so I decided to buy it. For my surprise the songs that I liked was the new ones, so against my own fanaticism I decided to give a chance to &quot;Say You Hill&quot;, a year after it release, and sincerely, has been one of the more pleasing surprises than I've received in years. SYW has become one of my favorite albums, and my 2nd FM favorite (after Tusk) which I already have long time listening at least 3 songs daily. Reading the other posts by users, the critics go mainly to the length or they label it as &quot;over-produced album&quot;. <br />  <br /> I just want to say something about it: I don't believe that I'm blinded by the fanaticism, since the very first time that I listening to it, my attitude was to rejected it, but I was captivated immediately by each track. Here you could find greatest Lindsey's songs like &quot;What's The World Coming to&quot; &quot;Steal your Heart Away&quot;, &quot;Red Rover&quot;, &quot;Morrow&quot; (one of my favorites) and &quot;Bleed to Love Her\\" that I waited more than 7 years to listen to this studio version and I notice that was incluided in SYW after I bought it! (what a loser). But the true jewels of this album are the Stevie's songs like &quot;Destiny Rules&quot;, &quot;Running Through The Garden&quot;, &quot;Illumine&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; and my favorite &quot;Thrown Down&quot;, which was initially conceived for her solo effort &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot;. SYW has created a great impact on me, make really happy everytime that I listen to it and has made me dust my old FM records and make me interest in Stevie's and Lindsey solo work. I recommend 100% for FM fans and no fans. <br />
B000008HPE|3.0|i got this before i realized that _sports_ is the only huey lewis album that anyone needs (and everybody needs it). don't get me wrong, i'm a big huey lewis fan, and some of his greatest hits are here: &quot;stuck with you,&quot; &quot;doing it all for my baby&quot; (a splendid song), &quot;hip to be square.&quot; they've kept me from pawning it off on someone else.
B00008EY65|3.0|I wanted to like this, I REALLY did...however it just fell flat with me.  It began with promise, and seamlessly picked up from the Nazi opening into the present, but not long after this the plot just got bogged down attempting to do too much.  For those Hellboy comic fans, I realize most of us really enjoyed it, but I prefer for my comic-turned-movie to be more coherent.  Just too much wasn't explained, and for even the most devout Hellboy fanatic, there was plenty that was just plain confusing.  I realize I get confused in my old age more often than not, but I ain't dead -- YET.<br /><br />The special effects were right on par with just about anything in film today.  In only a few places did I notice things that didn't look perfectly real.  The casting of Ron Perlman as Hellboy can only be described as pure genius.  Nobody, but NOBODY could fill Hellboy's oversized shoes like Ron.  As though he were born to play this roll.  He brought a really great sense of humor to Hellboy that I was worried may not translate well on the big screen.<br /><br />I think all in all, the film wasn't bad, but in effort to please so many people, the filmmakers tried to tackle just too much in bringing this great character to life.  I am NOT saying that I know exactly HOW to do it right, because maybe, just maybe this is one comic character that in order to do justice, needs more than what a single 2-hour Hollywood film can pull off.  'Course I could be wrong, and I probably am to many, but this is just my take on the whole deal.  Looking back on it, I had a tremendous amount of fun watching the movie, but maybe I'm just too much of a purist and feel that more needed to be added in order to make it all right.  All things considered however, I AM glad somebody had the guts to at least give it a try.
B00000JLWW|3.0|Technically, the scene where they show the engine room, the giant gears, crankshafts, pistons, the precision of all these parts like the inside of an old antique watch. These were the money scenes to me. The way the CGI water rippled in the ship's wake, the mindboggling attention to every microscopic detail, all the way down to the period costumes, chairs, hairstyles, even the spoons was mesmerising indeed. Cameron has a way of milking every single shot to make sure it has that &quot;Cameron-look&quot; and that's what I like about his movies, they all have his fingerprints.<br /><br /> That said, a lot of the dialogue was cliche and downright corny. Cameron's a perfectionist, sometimes to a fault which probably explains why he hasn't made anything new since then, save for the overhyped, and very stupid, GHOSTS OF THE ABYSS. The things that made Titanic attractive and eye candy, Cameron's precision and dedication to the little things, is what makes the weaknesses of the movie stand out. Some of DiCaprio's lines sound, well, mechanical, a little too rehearsed. And Kate Winslet's character seems a little too unrealistic. How could a society girl fall for a rat with slicked hair because he can draw good? And what would they have done if the boat hadn't sank? In the real world you have to have green to get a woman like that to even fart in your direction. I wouldn't have went through all that to &quot;tap&quot; some rich white booty, to take all those insults. What would any female find cute about seeing slob drooling out a guy's mouth? And lastly, why would Cal stay on a sinking boat to shoot a fat white girl taken by what most would today consider &quot;poor white trash?&quot;<br /><br /> All in all, Titanic is technically a great movie, a testament to the director's discipline and dedication. The pluses of this movie far outweigh its faults.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought Gavin's CD. And I fell in love with it. The words he used to describe events & important memories were amazing & unique. And to think he wrote them all, adds a little special touch to his music, everytime you listen to it. The way he plays the keyboard in addition to the melody & words makes me want to play his CD over & over again, Which I do! Even on the saddest day of mine, I know i can pop in Gavin's CD & a smile will always appear on my face. His happy-go lucky lyrics, strung on to a pop/rock/classical melody is enough to change any sad or unhappy person to a bright and bubbly person. His music is so personal & so raw, I feel like i'm listening to it for the first time, everytime. It's an amazing discovery that an artist can be so involved with his music & fans, never with the thought of profiting. A person with a love that big for music should deserve so much more attention. The success he has right now is well deserved. I don't think I will ever get tired of Gavin Degraw's music, it has inspired me time & time again. And my love for music has grown because of him. <br /> <br />-Rebekah <br />PS his striped CD is just as wonderful, trust me!!=]
B0001MDP3G|3.0|Not great. A movie for a slow night. The cameos were more interesting than a lot of the movie.
B000065V9Y|4.0|though this is a very similar album to--and from the same era as-- _so_, it's obviously the stronger work. _so_ just feels like a vehicle for the hits, and _us_ has very few hits. it's the record that came immediately after _so_, immediately after gabriel's stardom went through the roof. so this is his record, something he did for himself, and while that doesn't translate into a very exciting record, what's here is well done and never less than pleasant. _us_ has a very accomplished atmosphere. not to mention the two quasi-hits here, &quot;steam&quot; (probably my favorite PG tune, one of his most driving rock ditties...it has a bass line that just. won't. stop.), and &quot;kiss that frog,&quot; are great singles, just not the uber-hits which preceeded them.
B00004VVND|5.0|At Westworld you can live out your fantasies: you can be a western gunslinger, a lusty medieval lord, or a decadent Roman aristocrat. You will be surrounded by lifelike androids ready to indulge you in your *every* whim, and that means every whim. Every android damaged by you will be resurrected during the night. You might be a whimp in real life, but here you are a king! Paradise!    Westworld is the utlimate escape fantasy for wealthy adults. This film has a quite long introduction, showing how the humans abuse the androids. The tables turn suddenly. The androids are too well made, and have developed consciuosness, and rebel against their tormentors.     We associate with the androids; they are more real in their suffering than the humans in their selfindulgence. The last remaining human's escape takes him throughout the amusement park. He is shocked when he sees all the horrors inflicted upon the androids by uncaring humans.    Yul Brunner plays the avenging gunslinger. His role is similar to Arnold Schwarzenegger's in Terminator, but Brunner lends his character a gravitas totally lacking in Schwarzenegger.
B0002S943O|5.0|This is Depeche Mode the way they should be seen.<br /><br /> Filmed by Anton Corbijn over several nights of their 1993-94 DEVOTIONAL TOUR (listed by Q Magazine as &quot;the most debauched rock tour ever&quot;), the final product is an almost dreamlike chronicle of Depeche Mode at the absolute peak of their influential creative talents.<br /><br /> Musically, the song selection is on-target, the arrangements are tight & rockin', and frontman Dave Gahan is at his over-the-top best and surrounded by Anton Corbijn's opulent stage set and surreal visuals. Accordingly, after this film's VHS release, it was nominated for &quot;Best Longform Music Video&quot; at the 1994 Grammy Awards.<br /><br /> The extras on the DVD set include two previously unseen excerpts from the performance (&quot;Policy Of Truth&quot; and &quot;Halo&quot;), the tracks that were only released on the European versions of the film (&quot;Behind The Wheel,&quot; &quot;Mercy In You,&quot; &quot;Fly On The Windscreen&quot; and &quot;Everything Counts&quot;), the music videos from SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION, the original concert projections used on the tour, and two relevant documentaries.<br /><br /> At any rate, without bias, this video is truly one of the best live performance documentaries that are out there. It captures a band in top form, an audience in almost trance-like devotion, and, thanks to Anton Corbijn, the film is dripping with color and, at times, in hazy focus...much the way you'd remember the show if you had been there.<br /><br /> Recommended to all.
B000005S6B|5.0|Every year around December, among the truly great Christmas songs I hear -- White Christmas and The Christmas Song, for example -- one song is always missing. In order to hear &quot;Fairytale of New York,&quot; I have to play this CD.     This, of course, is no problem. This is a terrific CD with excellent songs throughout. Highlights include &quot;If I Should Fall from the Grace With God,&quot; the bittersweet &quot;Thousands Are Sailing,&quot; &quot;Streets of Sorrow/Birmingham Six,&quot; &quot;Lullaby of London,&quot; and the rousing instrumental tracks.    Shane MacGowan is an amazing songwriter, but even when he hasn't penned the track, his delivery carries such an amazing weight and sincerity (excellently displayed on the bands previous effort: Rum, Sodomy and the Lash's &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot; and &quot;The Band Played Waltzing Matilda.&quot;)    It's on &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; where MacGowan's writing and delivery come together perfectly. A duet with Kirsty MacColl, this song is too good not to be heard by a wider audience and not just in Irish pubs when the temperature drops. I can hardly listen to it with having a tear form in my eye and a lump in my throat. I know its been said before in the reviews, but this masterpiece of a song is alone worth the purchase of this CD.
0156027321|5.0|A stunningly dream-like psychological adventure novel, Life of Pi is provocative and horrifying, beautiful and unforgettable. After reading this work, one is left with more questions than answers. Yet,  I suspect that there is no bamboozlement going on here, despite some readers apparent loss of faith as the more fantastical episodes unfold. Accepting the author's premise that the purpose of this story is to invoke a belief in God, I would add that religious works of any worth invariably leave one with more questions than answers and leave it at that.<br /><br />In the end, the book is satisfying and stimulating and it lingers long on the brain after the last pages are read. Although there are episodes within the increasingly odd main story which begin to challenge credulity, the shocking epilogue--while not exactly neatly tying the loose ends together--at least provides enough of an explanation to make the whole of the novel comprehensible (while provoking some to a second reading in search of answers).<br /><br />I am not one that insists on finding the deeper meaning of everything that I read, but I revel in the language and color of a story. I don't pretend to understand the meaning of Wallace Stevens's poetry, for example, but I am struck by its beauty and rhythm. Martel's novel has a similar effect on me.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt
B000065VA1|3.0|how much you like this album depends solely on how well you can stomach a peter gabriel hit, because the three biggest ones are right here: &quot;sledgehammer,&quot; &quot;big time,&quot; and everybody's favorite, the genuinely wonderful &quot;in your eyes,&quot; as haunting and subtle a love song as ever topped the charts. me, i like peter gabriel, but this isn't one of my favorite peter gabriel albums.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|With Live at Slane Castle, the always excellent chili peppers show you why they are argueably the best band still around today making new music.  Even with a setlist of songs mostly from their last two albums, some of which I never particularly liked are played so well that any viewer is easily swayed into just loving the performance.  A real treat with this show is how essentially all the songs form this massive hour and a half jam with multiple songs getting cool new intros (take for example the amazing guitar solo intro to By The Way which I wish they had included on the album) and you will agree that the Chilis are absolutely fantastic live.  John Frusciante shows why he is arguably one of the most skilled guitar players of all time with his multitudes of great riffs and amazing improvisational skill when it comes to soloing (Just listen to Scar Tissue and you will be swayed to believe that the man is truly a god.)  I particularly like how he plays Under The Bridge shirtless exposing his arms which are scarred from years of shooting heroin.  It really drives the message of the song home that you should take an example from him and never use drugs because you will get f**ked up like he was and be all scarred and permanently screwed up.  Flea, as a musician, has pulled off a total three sixty and totally changed his playing style as of late and it is shown quite well on this DVD.  He used to play mostly slap riffs and steal the show with just mindboggling playing but has now essentially converted to being a rhythm guitar player who just happens to play bass but throws millions of amazing fills into every song.  Can it always be heard well? NO!  That doesnt change the fact that if you watched this DVD at a high volume you would see his amazing skill as a musician.  He still though does the crazy trademark Flea antics of jumping around like a jackass and doing a buncha crazy dance moves while playing.  (SIDENOTE:Before the three song encore you must watch Flea's semi hilarious trumpet solo which intros the encores)  Flea still though has a solo before around the world and adds a much needed solo to By The Way (No offense but the album version of the song should've had Flea soloing instead of playing the verse riff during what would essentially be a good solo).  He also does some really cool stuff along with John before Californication.  Anthony Kiedis is, as always, in absolute top form jumping around and putting every bit of energy he has into performing.  Then there's the good ole backbone of the band, their drummer, Chad Smith.  The guy is fantastic and sadly only gets to shortly showoff during his about minute long drum solo before Flea's trumpet solo.  He basically does what he's always done with a smile on his face, which is grabbing what Flea's doing and what John's doing and fuzing it to create a song.  It's cool when he comes out before his solo and starts playing drums on key with the crowd which is singing OLE OLE OLE OLE.  Sure the guy doesn't get to do too much during the show but it really is a joy to watch him play.  Overall, sure the setlist isn't that great but it's the state of mind they're in right now so deal with it but they do manage to take an average setlist and whip out this awesome show for the ages.  Anyone who loves music should go out and buy this DVD right now.  That's my two cents.  Peace Out.
B00028HBKC|1.0|The movie is worse then Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Exorcist combined.  It is gross and nauseating.  And it is not even based on a true story as it claims to be.  If you want to see the negative aspects of life portrayed more realistically then watch the stupid movies on The Lifetime Channel. If you want more realistic violence then watch professional wrestling.  If people convert to Christianity by watching this movie then that have a serious mental illness.  The real God would never commit ALTRUISTIC SUICIDE.
B00028HBKC|4.0|I have seen many adaptations of the life of Jesuschrist... this is by far the one that has made me cry the most. In this world we live in now, religion (especially Christianity) is accepted less and less each time, so when a movie like this comes out, of course it would be controversial. After all, when was the last time that a religious movie came out with such impact? Probably never. I'd like to clarify that Gibson's intention was NOT to try to convert people, he just wanted to portray his vision of the last hours of our Lord. This movie is great, but it's not for children or people that are weak of heart. The images are too strong. Christian or not, this movie would make any one cry... nobody is heartless. There are so many negativities surrounding this movie, you be the judge if you decide to watch the film.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarantino's films have always been propelled by great writing. The dialogue between characters is always unique and is impossible to beat. Few movies have come close to duplicating the likes of the writing in Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. In Kill Bill, Tarantino's genius definitely shows. It's the story of The Bride, whose wedding was massacred by her former business partners.    Now, after waking up from a 4-year coma, she is out to get bloody revenge. Of the two volumes, Volume 1 is mostly dedicated to paying  homage to older asian martial arts films and the like. It's filled with blood, gore, over-the-top violence, frequent dismemberment, and some decapitations. The film's violence turned away many people to watching it, as some of it is very disturbing. The character study and plot are less explored in volume, because Quentin has saved that for Volume 2. Having seen Volume 2, I can say that it is a better film than the first,  but Volume 1 stil appeals to many people, and is still very entertaining to watch if one isn't bothered by excessive violence. 5 stars, Very entertaining. <br /> <br />Sidenote: Before making your judgement on Kill Bill as a whole, make sure that you watch both volumes. Volume 2 really focuses more on the story and less on the violence.
B00003CXCT|1.0|First the ludicrous special editions, then the atrocious prequels... And now Georgie boy doesn't even let us watch the original movies. I hope he dies sometime soon too, before he destroys Star Wars any further. I won't be buying this farce. I feel stupid enough for throwing away my money buying the Episode II dvd as it is. <br /> <br />So sad...
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|When the album works it feels like a fun, hipster doofus melding of the post-punk retro of Interpol with the uptempo punk/nu wave of Blondie. When it doesn't it sounds like the band Jet injected with a bit of 60's Brit pop. I'd say it hits the mark about 2/3 of the time, but those handful of misses are pretty awful. <br />  <br /> You've perhaps seen the video for the lead single &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, an infectious romp that will certainly keep your toes tapping and your heading bobbing. The album cover matches the video for this song with it 80's style deco with pastel infusions. This tight number is led by a slick guitar hook backed with a persistent rock beat and simple vocals. Quite fun - it will either hook you instantly or you'll just never feel it. In my opinion, if you don't like this one then you'll hate this album. Beyond this I have several secondary favorites. &quot;The Dark of the Matinee&quot;, another single, is an often lilting subdued version of the preceding single but it steps up the pace during the chorus; Oddly I think this catchy segment is the worst part of the song while the rest is very nice. &quot;Jacqueline&quot; starts as a gentle acoustic ballad but grows into a jagged charged-up rocker. &quot;Auf Achse&quot; has a zippy bass-line ripped straight from a Duran Duran's 1981 classic &quot;Planet Earth&quot; contrasted with a rapid fire jangle of guitar. The lyrics fit the music well... this may be my 2nd favorite though it is not a planned single to my knowledge. &quot;Michael&quot; is a punked up gay love song; kind of an updated version of The Smiths &quot;Handsome Devil&quot; (only available on &quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot; if you care). &quot;Come on Home&quot; is truly a lost Blondie song straight from the same album as &quot;Call Me&quot; and &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;... pure disco fun. <br />  <br /> At times the album forgets what it is and goes a bit &quot;garage&quot;, something that Franz Ferdinand is not good at. I truly hated &quot;Cheating On You&quot; and &quot;Tell Her Tonight&quot;. It's like the wanted to throw in a couple of Strokes or Jet-sounding songs to cash in on that phenomenon. Stick with what you do well. <br />  <br /> In summary, there are a number of good songs on the album. Unfortunately you heard the best song when you heard the single. The other good ones are a cut below while the bad ones stink the joint up. The main problem is that the songs don't grow on you really. You like them, then they begin to deteriorate. The best albums are the ones the build over time and you change you favorite song with every new listen. This isn't one of those albums. Still I think it's far better than much of what's out there and I generally recommend it. Think of it this way: if you buy 20+ albums per year (me) then this should be one - if your entire collection is less than 50 CDs then this is non-essential.
0440224764|4.0|The Partner I thought was a good novel. The book is about Patrick Lanigan (I got it on audio CD, so excuse the misspelling), a lawyer who faked his own death so he could steal $90 million dollars from his former firm. Now he is in Rio in Brazil until he is kidnapped by a man named Jack Stefano who was hired to fine Patrick and bring him back to the U.S. for murder, and some other charges. They caught Patrick when he was jogging on a dirt road when he stopped to help this person who was changing a flat, but it turned out that their plan was to lure Patrick, then throw him in the trunk and drive off. Patrick has a new life, a new love, and is loving it until it starts to crash down in front of him. Once he is in custody of Jack Stefano, he hires a group of Brazilian thug's to interrogate Patrick to tell them where the money it. They use mean's of torture which it leaves Patrick black and blue in the more &quot;sensitive&quot; areas. Finally after being tortured, Patrick tells Stefano's men that the money is in a bank in Rio and belongs to a Rio firm where Patrick's girlfriend Eva works for.<br /><br /> So once this is said and done, he is then flown back to Memphis to be charged for murder, and other charges. See this is how Patrick did it; Patrick faked his own death, stole the money, and disappeared for four years until now, he is back from the grave! While Patrick is being taken care of by a Pakastani doctor, his lawyer Sandy; college buddies, and who attended his fake funeral, now represents him. Now Patrick's wife, and her boyfriend got life insurance from Patrick's death, and so far she has spent almost all of the money, she then finds out that Patrick was alive all this time, and could be sued by the insurance company, so her boyfriend takes matters into his own hands; for them not to get sued, he is looking into the hire of a contract killer, and since Patrick and his former wife have a child together; Ashley Nicole, she is now caught into the matter. Now questions start to arise, where is the money? WHERE IS THE MONEY? Patrick just gives a stupid look, and shrugs his shoulders. He does not know where the money is since it is wired from banks to banks all over the world. Once Sandy and Patrick meet, Sandy asks Patrick how did he get away; Patrick met a old man that was dying, so once he died, he took the corpse of the man, and put it in his car, and let the corpse burn. Once that was done, he met a little boy who was living in the woods trying to run away from his abusive step-father, so Patrick gave him some money and a bus ticket, and was never seen since. Patrick then watched his funeral in a tree not far from where they were hosting it. He was watching his own funeral, and laughing at the thought of people thinking he was dead. Sandy can't believe it! Back in Rio, Eva is then arrested and brought to the U.S. and they are asking her where is the money, he does not tell them, and so is caught in the legal battle with Patrick. As things start to unfold, we find out that Ashley Nicole is not Patrick's daughter, he took a drop of blood of her's when she was a baby, and had the DNA checked to see if he was the father; the test came out negative. Patrick then switches the tables telling Sandy that under Stefano's custody, he was tortured, but he tells Sandy he was under the FBI's custody, and the FBI tortured since Stefano proclaimed that he was with the FBI. So now, he want's to sue the FBI for torture, but as the book end's, Eva's father is captured for her information of where the money is, she does not know, but the money could be anywhere. So they let her father go, and now she is sent to Europe with some cash, and goes shopping. Before the trial could begin, Patrick tells Sandy that they cannot hold him because he didn't do anything wrong. He didn't kill a man to be in the car, he used the corpse, but that was it. So Patrick thinks he is a free man, but they charge him for muliating (sorry for the misspelling) a corpse, he served 18 months, and is then released. He goes back to Rio, meets with Eva, but she is gone forever.<br /><br /> Like I said, the ending sucks! Most of the book is worth reading, but don't be shocked to finish the book only to find out that Eva played Patrick for a fool.e served 18 months, and is then released.

B00005JMUA|5.0|Quentin Tarantino's films have always stood out in the world of movies. Even if a movie of his totally sucked, it's still written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, so it has that going for it. The Kill Bill story of The Bride is, in my opinion, very entertaining to watch. The first film, Volume 1, was more of a movie for over-the-top violence and homage to early asian Kung Fu movies, but Volume 2 was much different. Stepping back from the violence somewhat substantially, Quentin has gone to more of a character study in this Volume. This film is about what will happen to The Bride, because there is a catch before she can kill Bill. I liked Volume 2 condiderally better than Volume 1, as I don't care too much for the bloody dismemberment and decapitations that littered the screen in the first film. However, I still gave Volume 1 a 5-star rating. Because you can't critique a film until you've seen both halves of it. Am I right? <br /> <br />If you liked Volume 1 for the action and violence, you may be disappointed in this film. More of a character study, the violence is still there, but to much less of a degree and extent. But it isn't needed at all in this film to make it great. 5 stars, Outstanding. <br /> <br />Sidenote: Robert Rodriguez did the music for this film, and his score is absolutely brilliant.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw, an amazing (and may I add my favorite) singer/songwriter has outdone his last album. If you're a fan of the CHARIOT album, this is a must have. I cannot stop replaying it and introducing it to all of my friends and family. His passion and intent shine through on each song, and lyrically he is one of the most talented artisits out there today. Chariot-Stripped really hits home and that's what keeps fans (like me) wanting more. I especially love the last track, a cover of Sam Cooke's &quot;Change is Gonna Come,&quot; which shows his vocal and genre versatility. Gavin totally rocks out on every track, it's beyond amazing!
6303617700|5.0|I have the last release of the Star Wars Trilogy's orginal cut on Laserdisc.I got so tired of flipping the darn things.When I heard the Star Wars Trilogy was coming out on DVD,I was like &quot;YEAH no more flipping!&quot; Then I heard that Lucas was not releasing the orginal cuts in the set,I was kind of upset but I did'nt hate the 97 versions like other fans,the only new stuff I did'nt like was Greedo shut first instead of Han,and adding Jabba to the new Hope.That Jabba looked so fake,he looked nothing like the Jabba from Return of the Jedi.Now the Trilogy is coming to DVD and Lucas has gone back and removed the actor that played Anakin in Return of the Jedi with Hayden Christensen,talk about a slap in the face to Star Wars fans!You could of at least made him look older.Why is it when Kenobi dies his ghost comes back as the old man he was when he died?Yet Anakin comes back as a ghost as his Teenage self!And he looks younger then Luke.Well think goodness I bought a DVD recorder not to long ago.I pluged my Laserdisc in the recorder,dug out my Star Wars Laserdiscs,threw a DVD R in the recorder and put the orginal cuts of Star Wars on DVD.I even made my own Star Wars Trilogy DVD Box.Now I have the orginal cuts of Star Wars on DVD.Had to split movies up onto two discs to get the best picture quality.No I wont make other copies and sell to people,that's against the law so dont even ask me.But if you have a DVD recorder and have the orginal Trilogy on VHS or Laserdiscs and would like to get them on DVD well do what I did.But be warned some DVD Recorders has a copy guard device in players so you might not be able to copy a VHS.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|First off, how can you people give this fiddle-de-dee movie 5/5? I'm in awe, when these geeks come out to write a review, using all these big words that mean just as much as the movie did. Makes me really wonder! You have to be smoking something in order to `get this'! <br /> <br />Secondly, I never write reviews for anything, but this got me so ticked off, I just had to get this out of me. Let me spell this out for you, this movie is B-O-R-I-N-G. I still can not believe I spent money to see this! The storyline has no substance to it whatsoever; this script is the weakest thing I've seen so far - one word, garbage. The characters never grow, the dialogue is lame, and in the end it just makes you want to close your ears and shut your eyes! The whole atmosphere set by the characters is very very melancholic - just kill yourself already. The only reason I've watched the whole thing is because I thought there was something at some point of the movie that revealed what I was supposed to get, but no, there is just a blunt ending. In fact, off the top of my head I can't even think of any movie that is worse than this one! As well as on top of that, this movie gets an Oscar? I am confused!!! <br /> <br />My final words - do not buy/rent this movie under any circumstances, unless you want torture somebody the sociopath type of way. <br />
6305212112|3.0|Fried Green Tomatoes is a heart-warming story, but it's not a movie I'd watch more than once. One of the most annoying things about it was the fact that a lot of the story's points got mixed around. <br /> <br />For instance, in the movie, it is strongly hinted at that Idgie Threadgoode and Ninny Threadgoode are the same person. THEY ARE NOT. Implying that she grows into Ninny is destructive to her character and confusing to the audience. When you think about it, how could Mrs. Threadgoode, wife of Cleo Threadgoode, have been Idgie, sister of Cleo and Buddy Threadgoode in her youth? The movie also glosses over Idgie and Ruth's relationship. <br /> <br />The bottom line is this, if you want to experience this story fully, read the book.
B00028HBKM|4.0|This is a film that you either think is accurate or it isn't. I myself thought it was mostly &quot;realistic,&quot; though of course none of us were there when these things happened (the fact that Jesus lived is beyond debate) and therefore cannot judge if the events are entirely &quot;accurate.&quot; It is certainly is hard to judge this film if one includes religious bias. Technically, the film was very well done and gets bonus points for the Aramaic and Roman dialogues. The details were well-studied and reflective of Palestine under Roman rule. The classes of people were accurately represented. The setting was nearly perfect, because I've been to Jerusalem and cannot tell that the film was shot hundreds of miles away in Italy (perhaps owing to the Roman influence in both places?). The script is extremely close to the words of the Bible, though some parts remained somewhat inconsistent (such as the order of Jesus' words in certain scenarios). <br /> On the sentimental side, Gibson should not be judged for his execution, because he wanted it to be accurate. If someone finds fault with his direct approach, then I guess that person is blaming the Bible. Some people were offended that Jesus didn't run for his life, saying that this is entirely unrealistic and unChristian-like. However, the Bible says exactly that: that Jesus had several opportunities to free himself and not even go to Jerusalem in the first place. This is one example of Gibson's steadfastness to the &quot;original&quot; script, and I believe that had he altered things to make them more sensible, the movie would have suffered a lot. <br /> On the whole, a movie you'll want to watch just out of curiosity. If you're Christian, it's not to be missed because it will shake you up. If you are of another religion or atheist, it will be rather like watching another historical persecution of a sinless Man.
B000002KON|5.0|The Kinks' Arthur is my favorite album of all-time. For about 3 weeks straight, all I could do was sing the line, &quot;Victooooria!&quot; Every song in this album sinks directly into your bloodstream and plants itself like a parasite in your brain. The melodies are the best Ray Davies has ever written. The guitar lines, the best Dave Davies has ever played. Almost every song ends as a raucous pub rocker no matter how it starts (e.g. &quot;She Bought a Hat like Princess Marina&quot;) &quot;Shangri-La&quot; stands alongside &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; or whatever other epic songs you can think of, as one of the best songs ever penned. <br />  <br /> I really can't stress enough how well Dave Davies plays on this album. He truly is one of the most underrated guitarists of all time and this album proves it. His leads on &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Mr.Churchill Says&quot; are every bit as infectious as the melodies. The albums harmonies? Perfect. Lyrics? Only Muswell Hillbillies comes as close to lyrical perfection as Arthur does. <br />  <br /> Out of all these near perfect tracks, the one that touches me the most is the title track. At this point Arthur has totally exceeded his fictional persona and now represents every man. Its now clear that The Kinks really wanted to help people through their music. Everyone goes through harsh times, &quot;Arthur we know and we sympathize/don't you know it?&quot; We, the listeners, are Arthur. <br />  <br /> Buddy, spare a dime, and buy Arthur. I promise it will reward you, help you through harder times, and provide a number of melodies for you to sing through out your day. <br />  <br /> &quot;Arthur we like you and want to help you/somebody loves you, don't you know it? <br />
0452281881|5.0|...If you have *ever* worked in an office/cubicle/desk job, you can appreciate this book... and if you haven't, well, it's still absolutely hilarious!!!<br /><br />The plots (and sub-plots) are laid out entirely through the e-mail sent internally within the ranks of the London office of Miller Shanks, an advertising firm... There are characters you can love, hate, abhor, and sympathize with, and the book is filled with office/workplace back-stabbing, jealousy, and name-calling -- I laughed and laughed and laughed...<br /><br />A good book to read while laying by the pool and/or relaxing, as you don't have to do much thinking to get through it quite quickly and easily...
B00003CXCT|1.0|I can't say anything that hasn't been said before. Martin Scorsese has said, and I paraphrase, why bother obsessing over what I could have done differently? Just go on to the next thing. Or Huxley: if I changed a single word of Brave New World, it would be a different Brave New World. 20 years later, we are not the same people that made that work. Steven Spielberg had the govt bad guys in ET brandishing guns because he wanted it at the time. What would the great works we know be like if their authors had years later gone back to change them? The Godfather would not be what it is. The &quot;Director's Cut&quot; of Amadeus is not the same story. Etc. I will absolutely not be buying these. This is NOT the Star Wars Trilogy. ...Message to Mr. Lucas: I will DOWNLOAD a rip of the old Laser Disc editions. For FREE.
B0001ADAVK|1.0|If you are trying to gain a few brownie points by renting a nice chick flick for your significant other, whatever you do, do not torture yourself with this mess. I can't possibly find one redeeming thing to say about &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;. It's not romantic. No nudity or even partial anything. Total lack of pretty sets or scenery. Clothes are way conservative and non-revealing. Officially zero car chases and/or explosions. Do whatever it takes to get out of sitting through this: fake sickness, cut yourself, fake taking an important call on your cell, volunteer to do household chores. Anything! Don't let me say I told you so. Like garlic to a vampire, you should keep this dvd way far away from your dvd player.
1563894696|5.0|Gotham City's forces of justice, winged vigilante Batman, honest Captain Jim Gordon, and District Attorney Harvey &quot;Golden Boy&quot; Dent, swear to bring Carmine &quot;The Roman&quot; Falcone and his family of organized crime to justice. However, a mysterious killer begins murdering members of the &quot;Roman Empire.&quot; Dubbed HOLIDAY by the media, he/she leaves a bloody mess and no clues. Batman, Gordon, and Dent begin to become obsessed with finding Holiday, which slowly begins to change Dent's personality into something darker. Meanwhile, Gordon tries to keep his family together as well as Gotham City, and Batman deals with a combination of his memories of what drove him to crimefighting, the fear that he is losing his friend, his relationship with Selina Kyle, and the assorted villans that get entangled with the Roman. And it all ends with a friendship that is forever shattered. <br />  <br />  <br /> This is without a doubt one of the best BATMAN stories I have ever come upon. It's a beautiful story that perfectly shows the three heroes for who they are. A crimefighter trying to fight for the promise he made to his parents, a police Captain trying to save the town he's chosen to fight for, and a District Attorney becoming obsessed with a more violent approach to crime. Of course, they wisely retold the transformation of Dent to Two-Face, which was never done justice before. The origin is kept the same, just expanded upon and Dent is more humanized, while Jeph Loeb manages to convince the reader that Dent will become the Dark Knight's most tragic enemy. <br />  <br />  <br /> The villans are beautifully categorized. You have the Carmine Falcone, a strong, confident man who is slowly losing control over his empire. Carla Vitti, the sister of the Roman, Alberto Falcone, the son that wants to be doing what his father is doing, Johnny Vitti, Milos the Bodyguard, the extremley large Sofia Falcone, and Salvatore Maroni, the Roman's main competition for controlof organized crime in Gotham City. <br /> Then, you have the usual suspects, all of which are beautifully weaved into this year-long murder mystery. You have Catwoman, whose relationship with the Dark Knight expands as he tries to figure her connection to the Roman. You also have the wickedly psychotic Joker, the vigorously seductive Poison Ivy, the fear-inducing Scarecrow, the rhytmic Mad Hatter, Gotham's lost soul Solomon Grundy, the cleverly witty Riddler, and the inquisitive Julian Day, The Calendar Man. The Penguin also shows up, yet his presence is as brief as it is incoherent and unexplained. <br />  <br />  <br /> Tim Sale's drawing and art work is also magnificent. Batman is tall and strong, Catwoman is swift and athletic, the Joker is stick-like and discomfortingly expressive, Harvey Dent is handsome, yet always drawn with a slight darkness, foreboding his transformation, Poison Ivy is luscious, surrounded by plants at all times and with green skin (The way it should've been done in BATMAN AND ROBIN), and the rest of the characters look nice.  <br />  <br />  <br /> All in all, this is a strong book. The beautiful storytelling and expressive art work blend nicely together in what is truly one of the greatest Batman stories written during the dreaded 90's.  <br />  <br /> P.S: Would make a good movie.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|When i first heard Take me out, i was very impressed much like everyone else. I was hoping that this Cd contained more of the same. It did not however. I am a fan of many different styles of rock, and this album doesnt really rock. The only other tracks i really like are Matinee and 40'. When i listen to this album, the music does not draw me in. I can still listen to it, it just did not live up to the hype.
038551123X|5.0|I love books about serial killers (which is why the books I write have serial killers in them), and I try to read everything in this sub-genre.<br /><br />What struck me immediately about DDD was its playfulness--this book is fun. Dexter, though psychotic, is an amusing and sympathetic character. There were even moments where I laughed out loud.<br /><br />The plot--Dexter chasing a serial killer who is eerily similar to himself--kept me guessing up until the very end.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun, fast read; one that will keep you up all night, check this book out. You won't be disappointed.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I had not heard of Renee Oldstead prior to listening to this album in Border's. She is quite simply the best jazz singer I have ever heard. She has a beautiful voice and sings &quot;What a Difference a Day Makes&quot; better than Dinah Washington and &quot;Breaking Up is Hard to Do&quot; better than Neil Sedaka. If you love sultry jazz singers, your world will be an impoverished one if you do not buy this CD.
B00003CXBH|5.0|An exceptionally dense review by Roger Ebert gave this film 2 and a half stars. Apparently he couldn't understand what it was about or who the characters were. It is inconceivable to me that anyone could watch this film without caring about the tragedy that unfolds. In fact, the film seems to have been blighted by some of the most idiotic comments I have ever read. One reviewer thinks it was set in Spain; another thinks it is about the British; a third thinks that the De Niro character was an adulterer. A fourth didn't notice that, in the ending, the broken violin was found, symbolically, in the water, not in the mission ruins. Are these people real? This is an exceptionally fine film, full of compassion and sorrow at the contemplation of man's vileness and greed, especially when coupled with the moral cowardice and corruption inherent in the administrators of a bureaucracy. A fat Cardinal would rather preserve his life of power and ease than follow the precepts of the founder of his religion. Ebert complains that the battle scenes are incoherent. What does he think war is? Neat and tidy? Everything the viewer needed to know was conveyed by these scenes: confusion, misery and desperation, resulting in a massacre of innocents. Evil triumphs, yet a kind of faith survives, in its despite. Film-goers want feelgood endings. This film doesn't give it to them. Another reason it may have collected bad reviews is because it draws attention to the hideous history of the Roman Catholic church.
B00018D44U|5.0|This c.d. is amazing. Norah has a beautiful soothing voice that superbly compliments the music. I think it is just as good as her first album, it is definately worthy of a grammy. Once again she has created some beautiful and unique sounds. I could listen to her for hours. The only thing i didn't like about the album was the song &quot;creepin' in,&quot; her duet with Dolly Parton, i'm not a big country fan, but other than that i loved her c.d.
0312995423|1.0|This book is horrid. The action is almost entirely computer-terminology related. Maybe if you only leave your room to go to programming conventions you'll like this, but if you're more of an action fan I'd reccomend the other books. The Da Vinci Code is, of course, excellent.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|I am great fan of the blues and the guitars that Bonomassa plays are incredible. This is one of my favorite cd's to play when interstate driving (and find myself tapping the steering wheel) or just need a &quot;pick me up&quot; as I start moving to the music.
B0002O7XWC|3.0|The specificiations listed say there's the soundtrack and this 80 page booklet. How poor. Check out the british Edition to come. The REgion 2 edition will have great packaging, the same booklet, but instead of just the soundtrack, it will include a new master of the film and the documentary &quot;easy riders, raging bulls&quot;, which is also avaible as a paperback novel best seller by Biskind.<br /><br /> so I still hope this version will be updated with that documentary in a great package, otherwise we true fans just have to pick the British DVD
B000002J09|5.0|Plant, Page, Jones, Bonham....4 names forever connected to the phrase \\"Best Damn Band EVER!\\"  And this record backs up that statement 100%!  Everytrack is well written both lyrically and musically.  it's not at all an exaggeration to call this one of the top 5 (if not the #1) best albums ever!!!  Anyone who claims to be a Fan of classic rock will have this, and if they don't...they don't know classic rock.  Peace.
B00024BHTC|5.0|I cannot believe the negative and lukewarm reviews I have read here at amazon for this album. <br />  <br /> #1) This is the most superbly written and recorded album by any artist, ever. I refuse to list any credentals as to why I am right about this. There is no need for an explanation. Everything about this album is perfect. Listening to this album is like haveing a sheer ear orgasm. I own over 1000 albums (everything from ABBA to Zebra), and this one beats them all and everything else Ive ever heard in my entire life, in terms of musicianship, performance, production, you name it. I do not have enough time or space to write or explain the praise I have for Nightwish's masterpiece &quot;Once&quot;. There is nothing more to say really except this... If you have ANY taste in good &quot;music&quot; you will (at the very least) enjoy and respect this album. If you do not, then you are fool, plain and simple. Across all genre's (from Pop, Rock, Metal, Jazz, World, Classical, Blues...etc) this is the creme de la creme. The top of the mountain. This album is the standard by which all other records (of any genre) should be judged and compared to. If you consider yourself a sincere lover of great music, do not hesitate, purchase this album RIGHT NOW, I GUARENTEE you will not be disappointeed. Ignore all of the ignorant, immature, irrelevant negative and lukewarm reviews you might read here at Amazon. These people are fodder and know not of what they write and say.
B000002J0B|5.0|This record rocks!  every song is awesome!  i recommend every classic rock fan to get this album if you dont already own it!!!!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Muse rocks totally! Though it makes my blood boil that some critics and listeners think these beautiful lads sound like Radiohead. First of all, anything British is beautiful, they are always able to bring something unique, though I am also very proud of the recent music coming from New York bands...it's about bloody time! Okay back to Muse...all of their albums sound like Muse and no one else. Comparisons are just that BUT they cannot take away the dark and emotional lyrics of Muse...from the first album to now, they are combine classical, rock, goth, techno...it is their formula. Muse has hit the United States and now and only now have I heard these ridiculous comparisons to Radiohead...perhaps it is an American thing to compare and not just let the music be. Muse will hopefully ignore the comparisons. I think they sound more like the Darkness as far as the falsetto of Matt sounds...I thought it was the Darkness when I first heard &quot;Time is Running Out&quot; perhaps that is my faux pas. Anyway, I love Muse...you freakin beautiful British pale hotties in black clothing...ladies, you've got to love it!!!!!
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Dire Straits' final album...(sniff) The end of a group that produced such masterpieces like Sultans Of Swing, Brothers In Arms, Tunnel Of Love, Love Over Gold etc. Well, at least they go off in style with On Every Street. Calling Elvis is quite a song to shake your feet to when you're feeling bored, and My Parties is another testament to Mark Knopfler's genius about a backyard garden party. Heavy Fuel is also another foot-shaking song about lust, drink and violence. Overall, it's an excellent swansong for one of the most talented bands of the 80's. <br /> <br />Had Dire Straits not broke up, they might have matched the success of such legendary bands like the Beatles and Fleetwood Mac.
B0000028PI|5.0|I really liked 'Hey Stoopid' and when I heard about Alice doing another concept album I got really jazzed! Alice can tell a story through song like no one else! I picked up and loved 'Last Temptation' on the day of it's release.<br /><br />'Sideshow' and 'Nothing's Free' are exactly the type of music Alice fans live for. The disturbing and exciting visuals Cooper layers in his music are what keeps me coming back. The mix of electric and acoustic guitar, coupled with haunting lyrics will keep 'Sideshow' running through your head all day. 'It's Me' is another great Cooper ballad, along the lines of 'Every Woman has a Name' and 'You & Me'. 'Lullaby' is a creepy little song that should be on your Halloween mix tape. 'Stolen Prayer' is one of those songs that just sneaks up on you and you find yourself humming it throughout the day. Overall, the entire album contains everything you could want in an Alice Cooper release. I have read the 3 comic books that provide the story with Alice's disk, and they are okay, but you don't need to read them to follow the story. And as always, with Alice, the music comes first.
B00004Y6NX|4.0|Dire Straits has always been viewed as a second-rate band by me, but that was until I heard Tunnel Of Love at a friend's house. Once I heard it, I knew I had to get that album. <br /> <br />And it did not disappoint. Overall, it's a good album, but Les Boys let it down from 5 stars to 4. The other 6 songs are pure masterpieces by Mark Knopfler and his band.  <br /> <br />If you're a rock fan, get the album. Beg, borrow or steal it. If possible, get the LP because I think the CD version does not sound as good.
6305252521|5.0|I've never been a fan of Jim Carey, but the idea behind this film intrigued me. I'm glad I saw it because it is an incredible work. In fact I am duly impressed with the completeness of the entire project. The script, direction, performances and attention to detail all mix to create a veritable trompe l' oeil, much like the fictitious world of Truman. <br /> <br />This innovative film appeals to so many compelling concepts: The ubiquitous dint of television, the inclination of people to live vicariously through others, the turbid line between reality and the illusory, and the paranoia that someone is always `watching us'. At times I think that I must be some unwitting actor on a giant stage, being manipulated by some demiurgic force, because the world seems too ludicrous (not to mention the people that inhabit it) to be real. <br /> <br />Of course the most piquant aspect of the movie is the exploration of the idea of a higher being. Truman's quest for the truth of his specious world is analogous to man's search for the meaning of religion, and ultimately, God. This is played out masterfully here. When the transmission is cut a person from the barroom exclaims `Jesus, God In Heaven!' As Truman nears his escape Sylvia (from outside of the fake world) ironically prays for his deliverance. Christof (catch the name?), played by Ed Harris, sits in his control room as the eminence grise of Truman's world. As the `creator' of the TV show that Carey's character dwells in, his position is plenary. The trouble is that Truman has questions that his ostensible family and friends cannot answer. Truman knows his life is a mendacious trap and he wants manumission. Ultimately Truman and Christof collide at the boundary of the faade as the former forces a theomachy. The omnipotent entity tries to force his recalcitrant subject to repent and return to his existence, but he refuses and finally rejects his originator.  <br /> <br />Other moments in the film are as entertaining as the concepts are deep. The technological glitches are amusing and the people trying to get on the set and warn him are great (esp. the guy jumping out of the Christmas present). The viewers are interesting too; the lady who ignores her crying child in order to see the show, the elderly women who watch so intently, and of course the security guards who provide the movie's prescient ending when they realize the show is finally over, `What else is on?'  <br />
0064409422|5.0|This is either the first (published) book in the Narnia series, or the second (chronologically), but order is not important when reading this excellent book.<br /><br /> This is an Alice in Wonderland / Through the Looking Glass type of fairy tale adventure story for all ages, as told by a favorite Sunday school teacher with a strict biblical syllabus.<br /><br /> Four children find an unusual way into Narnia, now under the witch's icy spell, and their experiences pave the way for the future of this magical country.<br /><br /> &quot;Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,<br /><br /> At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,<br /><br /> When he bears his teeth, winter meets its death,<br /><br /> And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.&quot;<br /><br /> Chock full of mythical creatures and talking animals, the story progresses at an exciting gallop. Even Father Christmas puts in an appearance with some very useful gifts for our heroes.<br /><br /> The Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve experience compassion, bravery, generosity, greed and betrayal, sacrifice, martyrdom, suffering and redemption on their way to maturity before ascending to their rightful places in Narnian history.<br /><br /> The ressurection and later miracles by the great and powerful King Aslan, the significance of the stone table and the great battle between good and evil are powerful symbols of faith.<br /><br /> Read it first,read it last, but certainly read this book.<br /><br /> Amanda Richards August 2, 2004
B00005U8EM|5.0|A true gem of a movie, that I was very pleased with after the first viewing and has never disappointed since. The concept of the film, reliving the same day again and again, is a solid one and the filmmakers make the most of it. Director/writer Harold Ramis and co-writer Danny Rubin take the story of a curmudgeonly weather forecaster trapped perpetually in the same day from a cleverly set up beginning to a fitting terminus. They intertwine the repetitions of the eternal day with the vicissitudes of our reluctant subject and produce a work that is both smart and filled with jeu d' esprit. Add the comic genius of Bill Murray and the strong support of Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot and you have a notable comedy.  <br /> <br />Of course I must admit that the very idea of reliving a day is a reoccurring fantasy of mine, as I'm sure it is with many. The old wish, `if I could just go back and redo that' is in essence I guess a way to deal with regret and reconsideration of moments passed. That is why films such as this and `Family Man' and `Disney's The Kid' have such an appeal. The difference between those films and this one is that I could not find any room for improvement here. A rare strong Hollywood work that is truly sui generis. <br /> <br /> <br />
0446310786|5.0|Okay, here's another reminder that &quot;classics&quot; become such for a reason. How I managed to get through school without reading this is a mystery, but the loss was very much mine. This book is a treasure.<br /><br /> Set in the deep South in the 1930's, this book clearly describes both the extreme poverty and the prevalent racism of that period. Yet, this is a hopeful story that shows that even in the midst of these conditions, there are good people who will stand up for what is right. Well written, with terrific imagery, this book is both easy to read and gripping in its emotional content. The story is narrated from a child's point of view, and we witness her growing awareness of the racist issues dividing her community. Her loss of innocence is tempered by her respect for her father and his compassion.<br /><br /> This book addresses important issues about compassion and fairness, and how they can be used to fight hatred. It shows that even in times and places of great prejudice, there can still exist individuals who can rise above these evils.
020530902X|5.0|The classic case for clarity as the primary virtue in prose. I can't add anything to what has already been said here about it.<br /><br /> If you are interested in reading a brilliant argument for the opposite case--that demanding clarity does not produce better writing; that teaching rhetoric & stylistics, emphasizing writing as play, as aesthetic bliss, is the key to producing more readable prose--then check out &quot;Style: An Anti-Textbook&quot; by Richard A. Lanham. It's a brilliant, quirky book with arguments worth considering.
B00009Z576|4.0|After the lackluster &quot;Tormato&quot; went splat and Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left the band, Yes made the unlikely move of adding singer Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes from the two-man new wave band the Buggles (of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; fame) for this 1980 album. And while Chris Squire has referred to the Horn/Downes era as one of the low moments in the band's history, the one album that came out of it is actually very good. Horn makes an endearing attempt at Anderson's vocal style (though he strains at the high notes) and contributes his excellent production abilities, while Downes makes a credible keyboard wizard. Their new-wave sensibility helped perk up the beats back to rock tempo after the laziness of &quot;Tormato&quot;, and by throwing a touch of pop back into the Yes mix, set the stage for the band's &quot;90125&quot; success. &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;, keyed by a tremendous Squire bass line, is one of the great Yes songs of all time, up-tempo and up-mood; in the Boston area, this song got Yes its most radio play since &quot;Roundabout&quot;. By rights, it should be on any Yes &quot;best-of&quot; album. &quot;Into the Lens&quot; takes a core pop song (later simplified as &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; on the Buggles' &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording&quot; album) and surrounds it with a repeated, soaring Steve Howe guitar melody over a stutter-stepping rhythm section. &quot;Machine Messiah&quot; is another strong piece that allows both Howe and Downes to shine. &quot;Run Through the Light&quot;, a relatively straightforward rocker, and the proggish &quot;Does This Really Happen?&quot; are weaker cuts. &quot;Does This Really Happen?&quot; gives Alan White a chance to play vibes. &quot;White Car&quot; is an excerpt from a longer keyboard piece (played in full on the tour) by Downes. Perhaps it's the lyrics that Squire thinks don't live up to the Yes legacy? Most Yes fans, myself included, have never had any idea what the heckAnderson was singing about -- these lyrics are no sillier than any of Anderson's. <br />  <br /> This remastered version adds 10 bonus tracks, which are interesting but don't provide any hidden gems. &quot;Have We Really Got to Go Through This&quot; and &quot;Song No. 4&quot; are backing tracks Howe, Squire, and White wrote before Horn and Downes arrived. &quot;Go Through This&quot; sounded pretty good on tour after lyrics/vocals had been added, but here they both sound like the half-finished pieces they are. There are practice runs through &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; and &quot;White Car&quot; and single versions of &quot;Into the Lens&quot; and &quot;Run Through the Light&quot;. The biggest find is 4 cuts with Anderson and Wakeman from an aborted recording session with producer Roy Thomas Baker (Queen), in which the band goes farther down the &quot;Tormato&quot; road. The tracks sound tinny and weak compared to &quot;Drama&quot;, but, who knows, big &quot;Tormato&quot; fans may turn out to love them. One of the cuts is an early take of &quot;Run Through the Light&quot; that sounds more techno than the version with the Buggles. <br />  <br /> (1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal) <br />  <br />
0393325172|5.0|I did not want to see the movie Master and Commander at first, but after seeing it I quickly fell in love with it. The main reason being the friendship between the doctor and the captain, and so finding out that there were 20 books in the series I came here first to see what others had to say.  <br />  <br /> And it turned out that the whole basis of the series focuses on Captain Jack Aubery, as well as Dr. Stephen Maturin. As I read on with the reviews I noticed how many people thought it difficult to read and understand. And the series is at first, it is written in a different style that takes time to get used to, but once you do...you find it catching. It may take you twice to read Master and Commander to truly enjoy the penmenship, but it really is worth it. I deeply recommened to those who fear the writing style to go along with it a see where it takes you. Even though I myself am no nautical person, I found myself wanting to learn more with each new unknown term, and there is a book that can help you with that called &quot;A Sea of Words&quot; by Dean King.  <br />  <br /> I read the entire series before getting &quot;A Sea of Words&quot;, but I found it would've really helped, so I am telling you to go and get it now before you get swept into the series, because after reading &quot;Master and Commander&quot; you'll be wanting to gobble up the whole series. <br />

B00001U0E1|3.0|Shakespeare in Love is a thoroughly researched, lovingly written and acted homage to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It is the story of how the famous play about two star-crossed and doomed lovers came to be. Screenplay writers Mark Norman and Tom Stoppard say in the DVD extras that they wondered what Shakespeare was like before he was famous. They thought as a young, struggling writer, he would be like they themselves were: poor, horny, and suffering from writer's block. Much historical research was done, and the film is very accurate in its portrayal of Elizabethan society and times. The viewer learns a lot from the wonderful DVD extras. One thing the DVD does not mention that I was waiting for it to, is the placement of Christoper Marlowe in the film. Some people think that Shakespeare's plays were in fact written by Marlowe, Shakespeare's better known playwriting contemporary, until Marlowe was killed at age 29 in a tavern brawl. Shakespeare in Love works this controversy into the film in an ingenious and enjoyable way, that might put all doubts to rest! There are steamy sex scenes in the first half, just like Romeo and Juliet, so don't be shocked.<br /><br /> A large and splendid cast makes the film enjoyable and believable. There are so many good actors and actresses in this film it is impossible to list them all here. Joseph Fiennes is a wonderful young Will Shakespeare. He is the classic young lover, surprisingly nimble on his feet during fighting and escape scenes. Gwyneth Paltrow was, as the writers said, the perfect choice for Shakespeare's inspiration. They say on the DVD that she &quot;has a spirituality about her,&quot; and indeed, that spirituality shines throughout the film. Colin Firth is wonderful as the villian, the scheming Lord Wessex. And Ben Affleck almost steals the show as actor Ned Alleyn, who was a real star of the times.<br /><br /> Alleyn comes complete with a posse, and that is not the only 20th century cultural reference. These many references make the film very lighthearted for the first half, almost too lighthearted. But it gets better, and becomes tragic and quite moving. Judy Dench is the icing on the cake as the stupendous Queen Elizabeth I herself. In fact, in her breathtaking costumes, she LOOKS like a cake. The costumes are one of the main reasons to see this film. The Academy Award for Best Costume Design was well-deserved, as were the other awards for Best Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress (Dench), and the three other Oscars the film received.<br /><br /> Go rent this DVD, anon!many references make the film very lighthearted for the first half, almost too lighthearted.

1565847032|5.0|Noam Chomsky is an amazing author.  He picks away the dogma and doctines that Americans view the world through and offers a startling new way to look at the world.  It's a world controlled by the elites.  At first his ideas are hard to believe, then he might be a little right, and then he's dead on.  His analysis is coherent, well documented, and extremely intriguing.  In Understanding Power he touches on foreign policy, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the ideological control and propaganda, intellectualism, popular dissent, communism, economics, welfare, and utopia.  The breadth of this book and his knowledge is startling.  This is not a book to read to learn about a particular topic, but to learn a new way to see the world.<br /><br />His underlying goal and message in his writings is to teach this.  To question for yourself what you read and hear.<br /><br />This is a great book for students to read who are studying American History or Political Science.  I frequently mentioned this book in papers I've written at school.
0156027321|5.0|I am an avid reader and writer. I have read more than my fair share in my lifetime. I've cried and laughed over books, become attached to books, had odd mutual relationships with books...and something about this novel touched me more than any one I'd ever read. I have never read another book like this. The playful darkness is exquisitely written. The main character is believable and extremely lovable. There are times during my reading of this book that I laughed out loud. Sweet, witty, intellectual, and very emotional, this is a book like none I've ever read.
0553573411|1.0|I bought all 5 of her books and am ABOUT to finish book 2. I am on page 556 and still wondering why the heck people rave so much regarding her books. So far, it is boring as heck and the characters are stubborn to the point of stupidity and everyone seems to follow authority even though they all know it will lead to disaster and bring destruction. <br /> <br />All these 5 and 4 star reviews I am seeing just blows my mind. My favorite author right now is George R Martin and I know he has praised Hobb's books but there is no way in hell the books by the 2 authors are close in terms of quality. Not even close. <br /> <br />It is 2AM and I decided I cannot take my frustration anymore by reading the book and gotta just come online and let everyone know this is pure BS that it is a 4-5 rating book. I have read Fantasy starting middle school and have read many many books. And this is the most over-rated author and series of books EVER. I am just sorry I asked my friends to get them for me for presents. What a total waste of money. <br /> <br />It is not bad but I would say it is on the same level as Robert Newcomb and later Terry Goodkind books in that it drives the reader crazy with frustration in terms of how stupid the characters behave. Definitely none of these guys are in the same league as George R Martin.
B00005JN2F|4.0|For those who dont know The Bourne Ultimatum is the third in the series of Bourne Movies. The Bourne Supremacy was a very good movie and I can not wait until the third comes out. Matt Damon does a wonderful job of playing Jason again. He is a very underated actor in my opinion, but with this performance he should get his due. <br />  <br /> Jason and his girlfriend are away from everything when soemone tries to frame him for a murder and crime and this brings him back into the game. He is still suffering from amnesia so he has to piece together clues in solving why he was framed.  <br />  <br /> Spy movies alway captivate me because it is hard to think that these things really happend. the twists in the movie are great as well as the supporing acting. The best line in the movie is by Julia Stiles. They are trying to figure out who Bourne is working with, she is asked &quot;who is controlling him.&quot; She says &quot;do you want the scary version? himself!&quot; This is a very good movie.
B0000019PA|5.0|Anybody that gives this album less than 5 stars simply has not heard it enough. It's different, and sometimes different takes a while sink in. I believe this album is as important to the evolution of music as Nirvana's Never mind, Pixies Doolittle, or Jeff Buckley's Grace album.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I am glad to see someone with the heart to produce a movie such as this. This is someone that you would want to have as a pier. I was hoping to see the ascension of Christ at the end of the movie but that would be my only complaint. Hopefully this movie will plant a seed and allow those who are ignorantly stumbling ( they perceive themselves to be supremely intelligent and completely self sufficient ) in the darkness to grab hold of the truth. I hope that this movie stirs the spirits of believers and non-believers alike.

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is a very impressive band. The music on this album and their amazing debut &quot;Parachutes&quot; is an experience. It is different from most anything else you will hear. I still am shocked at what a huge hit the song &quot;The Scientist&quot; was. On modern rock radio no less! Not a normal modern rock song. The songwriting is strong and the musicianship in impeccable. This is a band not to be missed. They could possibly be the best band currenty making new music.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|IF I COULD, I WOULD GIVE THIS MOVIE A LOT MORE THAN 5 STARS.\\"Big Fish\\" is my favorite movie, and will be until something better comes along.{Doubt it}. I am extremely impressed with this and think that Mr.Burton and I have much in common.I'm going to be a future author, and this movie is the same kind of idea of what I write about in books. Believe me, there is definetely something wrong with somebody if they've ever said they did not like this movie and is not changing their mind. One of my favorite characters is Karl the giant. I agree  with anyone that this movie didn't really have a plot to it, but at the end it seemed as though it sort of did. I guarantee most people will love \\"Big Fish\\". I do! {If you don't like this, something's wrong with you}.
B00008J4P5|5.0|What hasn't been said about this band? They are the most incredible two-piece band I have ever heard. It is amazing the sound they get out of two people and ancient recording equipment. This band is blazing the trail for the popularity of other great bands like them. This is the future of rock and roll, not nu-metal (who likes that crap?). Go Jack and Meg!
B000007PI9|5.0|What do people expect from this movie.It's not Silence Of The Lambs and it's not supposed to be.What the hell this movie is great it's pure popcorn fun.We've got a super cool Stallone with some super cool guns and a bad ass car and we've got a hot Brigitte Nielson,plus alot of action,violence,action flick humor old 80's music,and even some dark suspense.But this is a guilty pleasure for the age's not some award winning movie.If your a guy,and I mean a guy who likes Hot girls,bad ass cars,cool action scenes, motorcycles,and a s***load of violence then grab a six pack of beer and a bag of Dorito's,turn out the lights and enjoy.
B00008NG5V|4.0|Jack Johnson blew me away with &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot;, which is so much better than most albums that have singles on pop radio. He is a good songwriter with a pleasant voice and a nice simple, refreshing guitar underneath. You can relax to this music or listen to it in the car when you're on a road trip. It really makes you feel like you are in Hawaii with him, listening to the waves crash down around the band as they play.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|The box says &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is 155 minutes... it sure seemed longer! There is nothing about this movie that rings even remotely true. And I agree with the other reviewers who blame it on the international cast and crew that put this waste of celluloid together. Jude Law: Awful! He sounded like a bad Forrest Gump imression. Nicole Kidman: Gorgeous! Other than that, completely forgettable. Renee Zellwegger: Breathed a little life into this turgid tale but was a bit over the top. I've told my wife that I will NEVER see another Anthony Minghella film! The pacing was slow as molasses in January and the story was never involving. The idea that these two characters could fall so hopelessly in love after ten minutes of face-time was too hard for me to swallow. And if you don't buy the love story, then you aren't left with much else. I must admit I found the DVD's extras more entertaining than the film itself! I would only recommend this to people who want to make a Saturday night go on forever.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I enjoy the music of Linkin Park and find it amazing how popular they are. There must be something the kids really connect to. I mostly just like the way it sounds. I don't think that Linkin Park is the best band in the land by any stretch of the imagination, but there is obviously something about them. It is hard to describe and easy to listen to.
B00003CXIY|2.0|The plot of this story is revolves around a college student, Josh Parker(Meyer) who recruits a group of dorm buddies to help him get from New York to Texas in order to intercept a mistakenly mailed video tape of himself having sex with another girl, before it falls into the hands of his girlfriend.  On paper, it looks like a winner and I expected to see something like a cross between Vacation and Van Wilder.  However, while you might expect this kind of movie to be loaded with side-splitting high jinks, I found the humor highly predictable and the characters flat at best.   <br /> <br />There are 3 main characters besides Parker and they are all pretty cliche.  First there is E.L. (Scott), as the obnoxious instigator.  There is Rubin Carver (Costanzo), as the eccentric pot-smoking A-student.  Of course, there is also the pathetic 98-pound straw man virgin Kyle Edwards (Qualls), who is the butt of everyone's jokes.  As the plot progresses: the pathetic virgin is deflowered; Carver smokes pot with an old man, and E.L. steals a short-bus and discovers the joys of prostate stimulation.  Like I said, it sounds good on paper, but every gag is telegraphed from a mile away. <br /> <br />On the upside, while the humor is flat, the plot is kind of engaging.  The main reason that you will keep watching this movie is to find out whather or not Josh gets to Texas in time to intercept the videotape.  You will appreciate the consistency and linearity of the storyline, which is not diluted by the inclusion of too many subplots.  It really is a good road movie, if not a good comedy.     <br /> <br />On the downside (except for Scott and Smart) the actors in this flick have about as much screen presence as a rock.  While the characters might have been written as one-dimensional stereotypes, at least they could have played thier roles with some enthusiasm.     <br /> <br />Still, Road Trip is a fairly engaging movie but only because of the main plot.  As a comedy, however, it is pretty flat.  <br /> <br />
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|The Strokes are the coolest band in the world. With their whole greasy-haired-cool-named-i-don't-give-a-f*** look and attitude, they just ooze with true coolness. They are the wet dream of any college radio station, with their fun rocking sound, and great riffs. I look forward to more from this band in the future.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin deGraw is an excellent live performer.  He captures his songs emotions.  Chariot Stripped provides the proper medium for him to display his abilities.  I had to get used to some of the different arrangement on his soings familiar to me.  However, you get lost with his hypnotic voice.  So get STRIPPED, see him LIVE and feel his songs.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|This is a band for fans of real modern rock like The White Stripes, The Strokes, and Modest Mouse. This is an extremely fun, dance-along, rock-your-arse-off CD!

If you want to hear the greatest rock in existence, definitely check out your local college radio station. Or check out the station I work for at: listen.to/wwsu. I am the Dean of Rock, so check out my show sometime!
B000002AH9|5.0|I was a little taken aback by some of the reviews written in obvious hostility towards Billie's performance, here. Words like \\"scarred\\" and \\"shaky\\" and \\"horrific\\" were used to describe her voice, and I couldn't help thinking- \\"But of course! This is a big part of what our Lady was known for!\\" (Ever hear her sing _Strange Fruit_? The emotion is so raw and abrasive and un-pretty that it can shock you. Billie herself said singing this song could make her feel ill. It is one of her best songs. It is one of the best jazz tunes ever.)<br /><br /> Perhaps I have the advantage over some of these other reviewers because I cut my teeth on Lady's recordings in the 1950's (think Verve, et. al.)- that is, after her voice had matured. I was raised on that raspy, plaintive sound, and I loved it. No one can sing a sad jazz ballad like Lady Day, and after listening so long to her later recordings, her earlier stuff sounded almost  conventional in comparison. Yet, maybe these are the albums a beginner should start with; you don't develop a taste for fine wine in one sitting.<br /><br /> _Lady In Satin_ is more of the above, intensified. In this one, Billie can make me want to cry, make me want to sing, and make me want to love more than ever before. The sound of her gravelly vocalization and skillful phrasing against the smooth, background instrumentals is wonderfully clarified- highlighted- just perfect. The music is full of meaning, and conveys great depth of feeling. As usual. If you, too, are a lover of Billie Holiday's great recordings, do yourself a favor and give this one a listen.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is an ambitious record that deserves all the hype it got when it came out. I wasn't too sure the first couple times I listened, but I distinctly remember the third time I listened. It was quite an experience. I just sat there mesmerized by the sounds and beauty. The lyrics are strong and the vocal-stylings of Jeff Tweedy are great and original. This is a challenging record, causing one to delve deeper beyond the surface. If you can do it, you will be rewarded by a very enjoyable, smart record. &quot;A Ghost is Born&quot; is also a wonderful release, and you should like it if you like YHF. Here's to Jeff and the band for making a truly great album that changed the way I think about music.
B00008EY65|5.0|The success of X-Men and Spider-Man has opened the door for a new wave a comic book adaptations. In the past, studios have played it safe and only green-lighted adaptations of mainstream comic books with large followings. However, this has changed as of late with Ghost World and now with Hellboy. Based on Mike Mignola's comic book of the same name, it has a dedicated cult following at best so it's a pleasant surprise to see a major studio take a big budget gamble with this title.<br /><br />Ron Perlman is perfectly cast as the cigar smoking, two-fisted action hero who eats Baby Ruth candy bars and loves cats. He does a great job of capturing Hellboy's sarcastic, wise-cracking nature. Perlman gets to utter cool one-liners and looks fantastic in his make-up (thanks to legendary make-up artist Rick Baker). Often, what makes it to the movie rarely resembles what was drawn in the comic book. Not the case here-Perlman IS Hellboy. With this role (and hopefully more sequels to come), he is destined to become the cult film icon of the new millennium (much like Bruce Campbell was in the `90s). Perlman has got the drop-dead cool action hero shtick down cold. With his hulking, imposing physique, he's Arnold Schwarzenegger with brains and irony.<br /><br />While the film has the requisite slam-bang action sequences, it is not dominated by them. The film is not driven by them but rather by the characters and the story. And this is because del Toro has strong source material to draw from: Mignola's comic book, in particular \\"Seed of Destruction,\\" which chronicles Hellboy's origins. Both del Toro and Mignola's works are steeped in the gothic and horror genres, in particular the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft. The author's influence is all over this movie as Hellboy trades blows with Cthulhu-inspired creatures that would make ol' Lovecraft proud.<br /><br />Fans of this movie are in for a real treat as the 2-DVD set is jam-packed with extras that will take hours to explore completely. Here are some of the highlights:<br /><br />The first disc features two audio commentaries. The first is by director Guillermo del Toro and Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. They talk about the nitty gritty details of the filmmaking process. Mignola explains the differences and similarities between the film and the comic book. This is a solid, informative track that is essential listening for Hellboy fans.<br /><br />There are three deleted scenes with optional commentary by del Toro. He mentions that two of them will appear on the extended cut DVD coming out later this year but in edited form so this is the only chance to view them in their entirety.<br /><br />The centerpiece of second disc is an exhaustive two-and-half hour documentary that can be watched in various segments or altogether. Del Toro provides a great description for Hellboy: \\"Imagine if The X-Files was investigated by an X-File.\\" This is a detailed look at the making of the movie from the graphic novel to the movie itself with great attention paid to the make-up and visual effects.<br /><br />As exhaustive and complete as this 2-DVD set is, del Toro has promised an even more in-depth edition coming out later this year. It will feature an extended cut of the movie and new supplements (including a brand new audio commentary by del Toro) that will go even deeper into the filmmaking process (if that's possible!). In a classy move, Columbia even acknowledges this upcoming edition and includes a $5 off coupon with this current 2-DVD set. Studios rarely, if ever, warn consumers of double-dipping and del Toro has been very vocal in the press about it. Nice.ly.

B00008ADPF|3.0|&quot;Silver-Side Up&quot; is a stronger album overall, but &quot;The Long Road&quot; has some really great moments. It is a worthy follow-up and will most likely please the fans.

B00008RH3L|5.0|Despite opening the New York Film Festival in 1990, Miller's Crossing was eclipsed by several other gangster films that year: some superior (GoodFellas) and some inferior (Godfather III, Mobsters), but all containing big-time movie stars that the Coen brothers' film did not have. Coupled with a detached, distanced approach to the characters and a densely textured plot with several implicit and explicit events occurring concurrently, Miller's Crossing became something of a cinematic oddity, a rare gem waiting to be re-discovered at the video store. Now, 20th Century Fox has finally released this underrated film on DVD with a beautiful transfer and a few extras.<br /><br /> &quot;Shooting Miller's Crossing: A Conversation with Barry Sonnenfeld,&quot; is the director's take on how he got into films, how he met the Coen brothers and his experiences working on Miller's Crossing.<br /><br /> &quot;Interview Soundbites,&quot; feature brief comments from Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden and John Turturro on working with the Coens and their views on their respective characters. They have the ring of a fluffy electronic press kit and look like they were done shortly after the film was completed.<br /><br /> There is the standard assortment of trailers for Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink and Raising Arizona.<br /><br /> Finally, there is a collection of stills from the movie that range from actual scenes to behind-the-scenes pictures.<br /><br /> Miller's Crossing has aged considerably well over the years. Even though it was marginalized at the time, only it and GoodFellas have endured. It also stands as one of the Coen brothers finest films of their career. This makes it all the more satisfying that 20th Century Fox has taken the time to release such a stunning transfer on DVD. While it would have been nice to have a stronger collection of supplemental material, this is still a movie every dedicated film fan should have in their library.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|The Australian outfit Jet is a great Stones-AC/DC ripoff band. It definitely sounds like an album that could have come out in 1973. The ballads are good, but not nearly as good as the fast songs. The fast songs rock with a vengeance and make you want to dance and sing along. Buy it and enjoy this wonderfully retro record!
B00003CXMG|1.0|The only possibly interesting relationship in this movie is the boy journalist's relationship with the editor of Creem, who acts as a mentor to him. But this gets about 30 seconds of screen time. For the rest of the time, you get to hear the protagonist getting nagged by his cliche mother who urges him at regular intervals, &quot;Don't do drugs!&quot; You also get to hear him getting the runaround while on tour with the Abe Smellman Group - a band with no appeal, no talent, no existence. The highlight of this band's creativity is when the lead guitarist drops acid and announces, &quot;I am a golden god!&quot; The movie is more or less This is Spinal Tap, with a fifteen year old journalist thrown in... oh yes, and a sixteen year old groupie who bangs all the rockers. That's wholesome, isn't it? Well, its supposed to be. You are not supposed to come walking outta the theater wondering why these guys aren't getting sent up for statutory rape.

I CAN SAY AFTER MANY MANY YEARS OF ACCEPTING THE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE SHOWN TO ME BY THE MAN CALLED JESUS OF NAZARETH - I HAVE NEVER BEEN THE SAME. WHEN WATCHING THIS FILM I SAW THE GORE, THE PAIN, THE SCENES THAT WOULD MAKE MOST ANYONE TURN THEIR HEADS. WHAT FEELINGS STURRED IN MY HEART AFTER ALL THIS???? I HAD FEELINGS OF NO CONDEMNATION AND FEELINGS OF A LOVE GREATER THAN I HAVE EVER KNOWN. &quot;THE PASSION&quot; IS A TRUE LOVE STORY THAT WAS WRITTEN MANY MANY YEARS AGO. IT WAS WRITTEN BEFORE MEL GIBSON EVER LIFTED HIS PEN TO WRITE. IT WAS WRITTEN ON CALVARY AND IT WAS WRITTEN IN RED.
B000286S8S|3.0|First off let me say I have been a fan of VH since day one (Yes I am that old), Second who cares who the singer is having seen both Dave and Sammy in VH and Solo, and Gary in Extreme I can honestly say WHO CARES. If I get the reviews right all you Roth era fair weather fans think VH should of ended in 1985 what a great loss that would of been. To me it has never been about the singer it's always been about the GUITARIST not the singer. I have every VH release and am still amazed at the way Ed can make even the worst singer sound great (insert vocalists name of your choice here). As a fan I am just happy that in this day and age of throw away music (Insert latest Bubblegum Band Here) That VH is still out there releasing music for me to BANG my head to.  Yes the sequencing of this disc is bad but it was done by the band not the Record Company and yes some of the choices were the wrong ones but it's called Van Halen not Fan Halen. I don't care for the new songs but like I said at least the boys are back and on the road and having heard Dave's voice on his last tour I am thankful they went to Sammy instead. With Dave on the stage it was talk talk no rock I came for the tunes not the Talk. So ROAR on VH and no matter who the singer is I will stick by the GREATEST GUITARIST ever.
6305511055|4.0|&quot;Three Days Of The Condor&quot; is the fourth collaboration between director Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford, and they did a very addictive film. The movie is a thriller that is amusing, interesting and addictive from beginning to end.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Three Days Of The Condor&quot; has a very interesting cast. Of course, Robert Redford in the role of &quot;Condor&quot; is the highlight, but also appearing in supporting roles are: Faye Dunaway as Kathy, a small but significant character. Cliff Robertson as the enigmatic Higgins and Max Von Sydow as Joubert, a lethal and elegant assassin.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Three Days Of The Condor&quot; is a very amusing film with a lot of plot twists that will keep the viewer interested in the story. Pay special attention to the plot, because it's a very well structured story, &quot;Three Days Of The Condor&quot; is a clever movie, with good performances, this movie requires an active audience, because the plot is changing almost every ten minutes.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|\\"Big Fish\\" plays a little game with its viewers. We are never ahead or in a better position then Will, the son to judge if what we see is plain fantasy or if there are \\"bits and pieces\\" of truth in what we see and he heard from his dad... Off course, everything seems like a long fantastical story, but here and there, especially towards the end of the movie, we get some hints that maybe some of these fantastical tales could have really happened. So where does this leave us and is it really important to know? We remain uncertain, but undergo the same process as the son, and learn to appreciate other things but the mere \\"truth\\".  <br />It seems that the only real \\"reality\\" in this movie are the very real emotions: shame, anger, love, jealousy are depicted in a way that makes us believe. Especially believable is the strained relationship between father and son. This is transferred  during \\"Big Fish\\" beginning moments, which give the viewer the whole problematic situation.... Indeed what can you do with a father that insists on being always on center stage, even on his son's wedding night? Personally, I can't stand the type... The son, telling the story, seems to be warning the viewers in advance \\"beware...do not fall for this guy (as everyone else does)\\"... but then takes you to a journey that ends with you, the viewer, just like the son, falling in love with Edward Bloom's character and storytelling in general.   <br />A key element in the film lies with the witch's \\"eye\\" telling \\"how one is going to die\\". Although we get to see what the \\"eye\\" tells two other kids, we never know how Edward Bloom is going to end his life (or at least what the \\"eye\\" said about it), so we never know if the \\"eye\\" did tell the truth and hence if the story was true. I believe this to be a key element as the knowledge of \\"how I am going to die\\" (or rather \\"I am not going to die from other things\\") seems to be a main element in Bloom's life and a knowledge that let him be the fearless character he was - at least according to his stories.   <br />All stories are heard with wide-open eyes but are not believed. Nor by the son nor by us, the viewers.... In the end I believe that what the movie is trying to say is that maybe our belief is not so important. If this is your story... well then let it be. Or maybe the message is \\"Live hard and die hard\\". Live with all your might and love with all your might. Live it to the full.  <br />The film is best regarded as a lovely fantasy tale with many bizarre creatures that people of all ages can enjoy. My young sons, watching the movie with me, loved the witch, the giant and the twins... But other then that this is also a story of coming to terms with whom you really are, after finding out what your heritage is really...and then learning to accept it as it is. Although the process of understanding was no surprise (anyone could guess that he film was going to end with the son telling a story), I did like the way it was told.  <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|Somehow between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Mr. George Lucas began his inevitable progression towards the Dark Side of moviemaking. His Prequels are downright awful, and most of the changes he made to the original trilogy helped ruin the magic of those wonderful films. What has happened to you, Mr. Lucas? Why don't you care that most of your fans want to see the original trilogy in its original form on DVD? Just restoring the picture and sound would be enough to make us want to buy it. Why bother with making even more changes than the previous &quot;Special Edition&quot;? Especially when most of the changes are either stupid (Greedo shooting first) or make significant changes to situations/characters(like Han bullying Jabba around) in the original versions of the films.      I can see why Lucas identifies so much with Anakin in the entire saga. Like Anakin, Lucas has gone through his own conversion process over the years, proceeding from the &quot;good&quot; side of the Force to the &quot;dark&quot; side. He simply couldn't care less about what his customers--the fans--think. Which is the ultimate tragedy, really.
0743243315|5.0|Monica Ali offers a peek inside the mysterious world of immigrant Muslims in England. As a Muslim myself, I was deeply impressed with the honest portrayal of the lives of these characters, a portrayal that flies in the face of the one-dimentional view and gross misconceptions of Muslims that are perpetuated by a lazy media. It is very difficult for the Muslim community to take an unvarnished look at itself, as Brick Lane offers, when it is under attack from all sides. No doubt, members of the Muslim community will feel as if Ms. Ali is exposing too much in public, but this novel is not meant to be a documentary. Brick Lane is an exploration of one thin slice of this community. This is a novel of growth, hope, pain, and honesty.
B00001QEE6|5.0|This movie is about a purebred Cocker Spaniel, who is later named Lady, that is given to the wife of, as Lady refers to him, Jim-dear. She has 2 neighbor dog friends, Jock and Trusty whom she confides in often. As she gets older, Lady's owner is expecting a baby, in which Lady feels like she is no longer a part of the family. She meets a mutt from the streets, Tramp, who comes by after being chased by the city dog catcher. They meet again after Lady escapes the arms of Aunt Sarah in a pet store because she is buying a muzzle to avoid Lady harming her cats. Tramp comes to her rescue to get the muzzle off and they go for a romantic dinner at Tony's (spaghetti no less!). They spend some time on the streets, get to know eachother, and come to find they like eachother. Lady realizes that she needs to return home, she does so, and is caught by the city dog catcher, tossed into the pound where she meets Tramp's &quot;friends&quot;, and is told everything about his street life. When Aunt Sarah retrieves her from the pound, she is then chained up outside to a leaky dog house. Tramp comes by to see her some time after, and she tells him she doesn't ever want to see him again. Shortly after, Lady notices a rat come into the yard. It goes upstairs into the baby's room, and Lady tries to stop it, but is still chained up. Tramp hears her barking and comes to see what's going on. She tells him there is a rat in the baby's room, he goes into the house, up to the baby's room, and fights to keep the rat from the baby. He makes a lot of noise in doing so along with knocking over the baby's crib. Lady gets loose, runs upstairs after Tramp, but Aunt Sarah soon shows up, calling the dog pound to retrieve Tramp, and throw Lady into a room where she cannot get to the baby. As soon as Jim-dear and his wife return from their trip that very same evening, they notice a dog pound carriage outside their house. They run home, ask what happened, let Lady out of the room she was trapped in, and they all go after the dog pound carriage to save Tramp (Trusty getting hurt in the process by following the carriage and knocking it over to save Tramp). Tramp is saved, given a dog license, and a home with Lady and her family. Then they all live happily ever after! <br />  <br /> This Disney classic is one you HAVE to own! I've loved this movie since I was 2, and I still love it today at the age of 19! There is no better cartoon about dogs than this!! This is a must have!
B00005JMX6|5.0|This was an absolutely great film. It kinda reminded of me, and that's what a man is capable of doing, risking it all, putting everything at stake, including his future, for the love and the idea of a woman. And that's the whole point of the movie i guess. I saw it twice because those were images that moved me a lot and i felt emotioned, and trully, to say the first as well the the second time that i saw it, and even the fact that it was a comedy, i cried but i was glad as well. True feelings i suppose. And i hadn't had these type of feelings before since the &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, except that here we see a strong support and belief of a man towards a woman doing all he can for the love of her's. <br />  <br /> Elisha Cuthbert is absolutely stunning and i will agree with another reviewer who said, who wouldn't want Elisha move right next to him. And make no mistake, looking at the scene where Matthew goes and takes him prom date, where Danielle opens the door, only one thing comes to your mind: Elisha Cuthbert is the next Cameron Diaz. Her face just goes through the glass, a shiny face and her smile is something off the hook. Emile Hirsch also played very well giving all the details of a man ready to do whatever needed for his love.  <br />  <br /> A great romantic movie and i will add it to my collection as soon as it hits the street.
B0000029LG|5.0|To the Chad Defeo poster, you are an IGNORANT FOOL!! Are you a writer for one of these tabloids? How do you know how much plastic surgery MJ has? Do you have a copy of his medical records? NO YOU DON'T!! And where do you get the idea that MJ has a pleasure of &quot;raping little boys?&quot; How could you say something like that? That was rude and uncalled for and you should be arrested for that. It's fine that you like Michael's music, but don't like him as a person, but don't go assuming sh*t when you don't know sh*t. And you said you hate his guts, how do you think he feels about people like you talking trash about him? <br />  <br /> Anyways, this is Michael's dark and deepest album and he really showed his true emotions. Every song on Disc 2 is unique in its own way. I'm looking forward to new music by Michael when this &quot;case&quot; is over.
0812580346|4.0|Robert J Sawyer again delivers a great story. The best kind of science fiction, the \\"What If?\\" In this novel he raises the question: What if the consciousness of everyone on Earth was suddenly twenty years in the future and everyone glimpsed their future lives for two minutes? The ramifications are staggering from a psychological perspective. Is everything pre-determined or do we have free will?<br /><br />As in Sawyer's other novels, the characters discuss all the scientific theories and ramifications of this accident in great detail that frankly will go right over the head of some readers. (My friend found these parts mind-numbingly boring) Boring or not, I am really surprised at the extent and length of the griping other reviewers have done over the viability of the science. It's FICTION! This is not a textbook or instruction manual.
B00006LLNV|5.0|This is a very diverse, excellent soundtrack you will enjoy regardless of whether or not you have seen the film.  It contains the instrumentals from the movie, composed by Elliot Goldenthal, who has also done soundtracks for movies as diverse as HEAT, Drugstore Cowboy, and the Sphere. I think all are good, but that this is his best. The time and care taken in the process of creating the soundtrack is evident based on a desire to explore all aspects of traditional hispanic folk music, the use of many indigenous instruments (in my opinion, especially from Veracruz), and a desire to fit with the characters themselves. The music is chosen in a manner that seems just as much designed to meet with the real Frida's approval than anyone elses. It walks a tightrope between truly original music, traditional structure, and idiosyncratic homage to its historical characters very well.<br /><br />In addition to the 10 instrumental tracks that provide musical background and atmosphere, the 14 other performance songs are just as intrinsic to the film. Several are actual musical performances within the movie, and while no one would portray \\"Frida\\" as a musical, people do indeed sing in the movie, including Salma Hayek in her role as Frida (she has a good voice and also sang in the movie \\"Desperado\\"), and dance scenes within the movie are important to the character and music and self reinforce each other.<br /><br />Several musical styles are represented, and the perfomers themselves run the gamut from the famous to the obscure, the very old to the very young. The most well known is Lila Downs, although for those with long memories it also features Chavela Vargas, who personally knew Frida (to put it mildly). Not only does it contain a current song by her, her voice struggling against the years but still filled with passion, but it also contains a song by her recorded nearly 50 years ago.  Contrast that to a song by Los Cojolites [[ASIN:B0064U6PUY Sembrando Flores]], a band of youngsters age 12-20 who have a fresh twist on the Son Jarocho sound. It is an unexpected gem and a truly feel good song about kids chasing a rabbit of all things.<br /><br />The diversity in age of the performers has caused some people to portray some songs as not technically proficient, and somehow lacking, but because this a movie that covers almost the entire life of a woman, from young, lively, and vivacious up to barren, bed-bound, and death, the age of the peformers parallel the stages of her life. If you had to sum up the music with one word, it would be \\"authentic\\".<br /><br />It's hard to go wrong with this CD on a multitude of levels, and has been put together with forethought rarely seen in such a compilation.ters age 12-20 who have a fresh twist on the Son Jarocho sound.

B00005JN2F|4.0|Of course, this movie is nothing like the book. No Carlos the Jackal and all that stuff. If you're looking for the book on the big screen -- don't go -- you'll only be disappointed.<br /><br />If you just want to see Matt Damon kick butt and destroy cars - this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Joan Allen was great (of course) as CIA agent Landy, who opens a huge can of worms when she starts nosing around in Project Treadstone and Jason Bourne after her Berlin operation is sabotaged by Bourne (she thinks). I was disappointed that Franka Potente and Julia Stiles were on-screen for perhaps ten minutes each, and especially disappointed that Chris Cooper, one of my favorite actors (see A Thousand Pieces of Gold!), did not make a full-body appearance. Overall impression: very good, butt-kicking excitement.
B00006RINF|5.0|I bought comalies about half a year ago and i still find myself listening to it almost every day. Listen, they might have a gothic sound, but im not in any way a gothic person! this album is so catchy that you could be any type of person and love it!  This album is definitly a step up from Unleashed Memories in my opinion. The main reason is because it still has that beautiful melancholy sound like the others, but is HEAVIER. This band has definitly produced an original sound unlike a lot of bands. Comalies' tracks will slowly pull you into LC's world, almost as if you were floating! <br />Here's a review of each track: <br /> <br />Swamped 9/10: Very good song to start out the album, it shows you the melancholy/heavy side which you'll experience a lot in the rest of the album. Good range of vocals by Cristina. <br /> <br />Heaven's a lie 10/10: Could very well be the best rock song ever with a female vocalist! This is a well-developed song with even a background orchestra on the chorus. Its heavy, melodic, and the vocals are flawless by both singers!(which you dont hear often with this group) what more could you ask for in a rock song? <br /> <br />Daylight Dancer 9/10: One of the more heavier, darker songs of the album. Im not gothic at all, but i still think its a catchy song. Its probably a good one for all you goths out there. <br /> <br />Humane 8/10: The first soft song of the album.  Its ok but i dont really care for the keyboards in this one. <br /> <br />Self Deception 9/10: Another solid, heavy song.  The elements of this song sound like the heavy ones from unleashed memories.  I like the straight up riffs of the guitar with Andreas voice, and then how it breaks down into the chorus with Cristinas vocals.  Cristinas vocals are also amazing on this song. <br /> <br />Aeon 10/10 : Beautiful instrumental work. This song shows you what Lacuna Coils music is all about..It almost makes you feel like your floating into their world of melancholy, but absolutly beautiful music. <br /> <br />Tight Rope 7/10: The heaviest song on the album. I give this a 7 though because it lacks the melody you hear in the rest of the album. <br /> <br />Ghost Woman and the Hunter 9/10: Going back into the gloomy melody. Cristina does a good job going solo on this song. This song can be catchy, but it takes a lot of listens in my opinion. <br /> <br />Unspoken 9/10: Another harder song with the accompaniment of violins.  Good, hard, melodic as ever..no other way to put it. <br /> <br />Entwined 10/10: Along with Heaven's a lie, this is tied for my fav. LC song! This song is absolutly flawless! it shows you that this band can do a softer metal song, and have both vocalists performing at their best. For all you guys out there with a woman, i reccomend you listen to this one with your girl, its a good song to make love to.... <br /> <br />Prophet Said 9/10: Back to the heavy stuff again. This songs layout is similar to track #5 with the straight, heavy riffs throughout the verses. The end of the song is especially catchy, because it goes into this beautiful breakdown with Cristina. <br /> <br />Angel's Punishment 8/10: My least fav. song of the album, only because of the lyrics.  I think the band just got depressed and upset, and decided to write this song. Another good gothic one though for you people. <br /> <br />Comalies 10/10: A perfect song to end the album. This is prob my second favorite song on the album.  Cristina shows off her sexy italian vocals and then breaks it down in english on the chorus. A beautiful song, and another decent one to listen to while making love!
0792165020|4.0|I can understand why many people don't like this movie. It is a story where there are no really likeable characters. You have Tom Ripley (played wonderfully by Matt Damon), the poor kid who bluffs his way into a trip to Italy on behalf of rich Mr. Greenleaf to corral his errant son Dickie. Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law looking more healthy and tanned than I've ever seen him) is a spoiled, indulgent brat who wants to drift through the rest of his life spending daddy's money. (Daddy could just cut him off - but then there wouldn't be a story would there?) And then there is the long-suffering Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow looking ever so chic in 50s period costumes), who for such an intelligent, independent writer living on her own in Italy, could hardly be more stupid than to keep deluding herself about Dickie's faithfulness.<br /><br />Tom Ripley is envious of the life Dickie leads, and who can blame him? Push comes to shove and Dickie ends up dead in the ocean (and I don't think anyone misses him but Marge). You cannot help but feel a nauseating pity for Tom Ripley and his sick scheme to take over Dickie's life. The homosexual subtext makes it even more uncomfortable and tense. Have never seen a finer performance by Matt Damon (but I would go watch him read a phone book). Small but pivotal parts by Cate Blanchett, luminously beautiful in period costumes, and Philip Seymour Hoffman in his perpetual role of the fat, obnoxious, frat-boy type. (Neither one of them is likeable, either.)
0920668364|5.0|I can't believe people are bashing this book! I've always read it to my now four year old. Never once has he asked about death. Yes, in the make believe story the woman picks up her grown son. People who are creeped out by this or think that it shows too much devotion are WAY TOO LITERAL. The book is a metaphor so simple even a child could understand it. Hey, WAIT! It's a childrens book! No wonder the adults don't get it!
B00001OH7V|5.0|Before I begin I just want to say I can't possibly put into words what this album means to me. With that I mind let us begin. <br />  <br /> If you do not know it already, &quot;Heroes&quot; was the second in a trilogy of albums ,including Low and Lodger, that Bowie made in Berlin. To end his cocaine habit, he rented a small apartment above a garage in Berlin and roomed with Iggy Pop.  <br />  <br /> On &quot;Heroes&quot;, he again teamed up with Brian Eno (of Roxy Music fame) to make this classic album. Although, mose people think Eno produced this album it was actually Tony Visconti who did but nonetheless Eno's presence was definitely felt. Along with Eno, Bowie brought in one of the greatest and underated guitarists of all time, Robert Fripp (of King Crimson fame.)  <br />  <br /> The album opens up with 2 pretty guitar heavy songs, Beauty and the Beast and Joe the Lion. Beauty and the Beast is a pretty upbeat song compared to the rest of this pretty dark album. Joe the Lion has a giant guitar riff by Fripp about performance artist Chris Burden.  <br />  <br /> Then comes in my opinion the best love song of all time, &quot;Heroes&quot;. The song has one of the best guitar riffs of all time. It's cool, dark, and hauntingly beautiful at the same time. Fripp is a genius of feedback and you can definitely tell it on this track. The song is a true story about 2 lovers Bowie seen everyday at the same time by the Berlin Wall. The lyrics are just genius and some say it's Bowie's best song. I got the pleasure of seeing him do this masterpiece live during Bowie's Reality tour. <br />  <br /> Sons Of The Silent Age has some pretty out there lyrics by Bowie but has a killer chorus.  <br />  <br /> Blackout is a very cool song using some great synthesizer work by Eno and perfect guitar work and genius lyrics. <br />  <br /> V-2 Schneider is a mostly instrumental song using saxophones and a lot of keyboards. It's a pretty catchy, upbeat song. <br />  <br /> The next 3 songs are all ambient songs collobrating with the creators of ambient music Eno and Fripp.  <br />  <br /> Sense Of Doubt has a dark piano riff but is oterwise pretty boring. <br />  <br /> Moss Garden is a heartbreaking song that evokes so much emotion without using any words. It's like you've been transported to a dreamlike world when listening to it. It uses Asian guitars to create a pretty original sound. Definitely an underated classic. <br />  <br /> Neukoln is a dark track that uses a saxophone as a main instrument but not in the usual way. Bowie hits some some ear piercing notes using it and is a really unique song. Bowie is a really good saxophonist but never gets any credit for some reason. <br />  <br /> The Secret Of Arabia is one of catchiest, coolest, danceable songs I've ever heard. It has a bass line that is guaranteed to be stuck in your head for days. The piano is just downright funky and this song uses a bunch of handclaps that you will drfinitely be imitating while listening. Coming out of athe instrumentals it's an odd choice to close the album but works really well oddly enough.  <br />  <br /> If you buy this album make sure you have a lot of time on your hands. This album will take a few listens all the way through to fully appreciate it, but it is definitely worth it. Buy it right now!
B00006AW2O|5.0|Brian Jones. The difference between the Stones and all of the imitators since is the undercurrent of real blues that Brian provided; not rave-up crap, but solid 'Chess'-style backup. For all of the rebelliousness attributed to the band and the man, their long suit is tradition, no matter how much youthful energy is piled on top of it.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Whether you hate them or love them, the fact remains that Linkin Park are one of the most popular bands on the scene. They've won all kinds of awards and had over 10 singles with only TWO CDs. On top of that, they even got airplay from their remix album. There's no denying that the masses adore LP. <br />  <br /> Meteora is what a lot of people have called it: essentially the same thing as Hybrid Theory. They have branched out a little and made some more original songs that fall away from the traditional &quot;Linkin Park song&quot;, such as Breaking the Habit, Nobody's Listening, Faint, and From the Inside. Of course the typical rap-rock songs are still there, like Somewhere I Belong, Figure_09, Lying From You, and Hit the Floor. And you still have your &quot;Chester Ballads&quot; in Easier to Run, Don't Stay, and Numb. And the essential formula is still mainly the same throughout the CD as it was throughout Hybrid Theory. <br />  <br /> But why do I still listen? If they keep their style throughout two CDs, I'm completly fine with that. This is the reason I bought Hybrid Theory in the first place, isn't it? I adore the sound of Linkin Park, everything about their songs I like. Shinoda's rapping is some of the only rapping I can tolerate, and probably because it's set to the unique style of metal/techno/hip-hop that Linkin Park alone can play masterfully. I have no reason to relate to the so-called &quot;teenage angst&quot; lyrics, nor to hate them because they &quot;can't play metal as good as Tool&quot;. I don't hate Chester because he supposedly &quot;trys to Justin Timberlake&quot;, I have NO idea where that complaint came from. How can you possibly compare someone like Timberlake to LP?  <br />  <br /> The CD is just as good as Hybrid Theory. Enjoy some of the new styles, and revel in the familiar rap/rock that Linkin Park made popular again. I'm a fan for life.
B000286S8S|5.0|I read ALL 107 reviews on this CD and I am astounded at the so called &quot;fans&quot; poor to mediocre reviews. This CD is one of the BEST compilations of songs from the GREATEST rock group of all time! The songs are timeless and awesome! I dare anyone not to crank the volume and sing along while at home or in their cars! WOW, to read that some &quot;fans&quot; thought that the bands downfall was AFTER DLR left and when Sammy came in....there are no words to describe my astonishment at such statements! That Sammy led VH to a more &quot;pop&quot; sound....again, astonishment! A true VH fan takes the good with the bad, follows them no matter what ludicrous lead singer they put in and NEVER becomes a fair-weather fan, which was, unfortunately, whom most of the reviews were from! This is a GREAT CD and an even better concert coming from a TRUE VH FAN! Please, don't miss out on either one! Money very well spent....on both!!
B000003TA4|4.0|This was Nirvana's ticket to success! Just take the first 9 seconds of the first track and you'll hear rock history in the making and a music revolution begin. <br />  <br /> If you like: <br /> Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot;  <br /> Soundgarden's &quot;Superunknown&quot;  <br /> Greenday's &quot;Dookie&quot; <br /> Everclear's &quot;Sparkle and Fade&quot; <br /> Stone Temple Piolets's &quot;Core&quot;  <br /> Jawbreaker's &quot;24 Hour Revenge Therapy&quot; <br />  <br /> Than this CD will blow your mind. from the hardcore sound's of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Territorial Pissings\\" to the depressing acoustics of \\"Something In The Way\\" and \\"Polly\\" Nevermind is gold through and through. Possibly the best grunge album ever!  <br />
B000001EMW|4.0|Personally, I think that most tribute albums are crap. To be fair, I haven't listened to too many, but that's my opinion of what I've heard thus far. This, on the other hand, is something special. These songs are played so well by the these celloists that it almost seems like these songs were made for the cello, while still remaining incredibly faithful to the original versions. This album shows in terrific clarity the the complexity of song structure that both classical music and metal share. <br /> <br />Most impressive, though, is the down-to-the-note accurate recreation of the guitar instrumental and solo parts, which even manage to give Kirk Hammet a run for his money. Also impressive is the rhythm section which does a great job of conveying Lars Ulrich's parts - WITHOUT ANY DRUMS! <br /> <br />Overall, a very nice job of remaking Metallica's metal masterpieces into classical masterpieces without losing the essence of the originals, and a good conveyor of the links between metal and classical. I would reccomend this album to any metal, classical, or open-minded music fan. <br /> <br />Nice job, Apocalyptica. You've done both sides proud.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is a very unique bands with saying that this is a must buy for any fan of Rock......every song is written with precise musical mastery &quot;you gotta love it&quot; my personal favorites are &quot;Hooker with a Penis&quot; &quot;Stinkfist&quot; and &quot;H&quot; but hey theres probually millions of people that like those songs anyways dont be a wimp and go buy the newest Nelly cd be a MAN and go buy this instead trust me you will understand one of these days
B000002P5R|5.0|It's really hard to put into words how amazing this album is. Hendrix's 3 other studio albums were of course among the greatest ever, but they always seemed to have one or two songs that seemed really meant just for radio play. <br />  <br /> But in this album you can hear all that Jimi has to offer (as far we know) in his total musical dominance of guitar. Never have a heard such a well produced album, the tone of the guitar on each track is outstanding, I really can't think of anyway to make any of these songs better. <br />  <br /> I am serious when i say the first 7 songs are absolute knockouts, I'm talking all-time classics with great lyrics, guitar, bass, and drums. The eighth track (Drifting) brings you back down to Earth from the straight ahead songs previous to it, with its soulful lyrics and tasteful guitar licks. Then the 9th track gets you up and going again with its amazing intstrumentals as in any other Hendrix song for the rest of the album. Stepping Stone (track 10) is another flawless song with a head tilting, kiss-facing (you know what I'm talking about, guitar players!) wah drenched guitar.  <br />  <br /> &quot;My Friend&quot; is a neat little track that seems to take place in a little bar, where Jimi is just hanging out with some friends, the chord changes in this song are absolutely fabulous, as are the lyrics.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Straight Ahead&quot; is very similar to &quot;Stepping Stone&quot; in feel, but is decidely its own track. Another flawless song by Hendrix. <br />  <br /> &quot;Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)&quot; is such a majestic, beautiful, and so very Hendrix track its become one of my favorites, so much soul in it. <br />  <br /> &quot;Earth Blues&quot; is another &quot;only-Hendrix-could-do-this&quot; song that again is jampacked with soul, as with every Hendrix song. <br />  <br /> &quot;Astro Man&quot; is a song with this strange sly Hendrix wit that one just has to love, a great track. <br />  <br /> &quot;In From the Storm&quot; is one of my all time favorite Hendrix songs for its outstanding riff, absolute funk, and overall soul, Jimi must've had some inspiration making this absolute masterpiece. <br />  <br /> &quot;Belly Button Window&quot; is a clever little track comprising only of Jimi on vocal, lead guitar, and rhythm guitar, and is absolutely fabulous, the first time I heard it I had to listen to it again; showcases even more of Jimi's wit and amazing guitar power. <br />  <br /> I haven't described the first 7 trackes cause when you buy this album, I'd like you to be as floored as possible. <br />  <br /> Kudos to Billy Cox on Bass and Mitch Mitchell on Drums, they really made all these tracks so funky, a flawless rhythm section. <br />  <br /> This is the height of one man's absolute ability to create the greatest music ever. <br />  <br /> THIS ALBUM IS A MUST. <br />  <br />
0064407667|4.0|Lemony Snicket, The Bad Beginning (Scholastic, 1999)<br /><br />One thing I have figured out from reading the many, many reviews posted of The Bad Beginning-- the elusive Mr. Snicket seems to be second only in kidlit popularity these days to the overblown, overhyped J. K. Rowling-- is that folks really seem caught off-guard by black humor. Thus, they didn't really catch the humor here, and so a common thread of \\"they get better as they go along\\" runs through the extant reviews. I'm taking then with a grain of salt, but if it's true, I'm looking forward to reading the rest of these.<br /><br />Most folks who have not been knee-high to a grasshopper in a few years will probably be able to gulp this puppy down in a quiet afternoon. And hey, your kids are clamoring for this, so you should probably see what all the fuss is about, right? You'll be glad you did. Lemony Snicket is a sick, twisted individual with the blackest sense of humor since H. P. Lovecraft or thereabouts, having his characters deadpan ironic one-liners while the world is falling down around their ears, choosing seemingly random words to define (including one about two-thirds of the way through the book so utterly brilliantly carried off that I had to pick my jaw up off the floor at Snicket's cleverness), and constantly warning the reader that, well, the events herein are going to depress the living death out of him. All in all, it's a wonderful piece of work. It deals with the Baudelaire children, whose parents have died in a mysterious fire a page or two before the book opens (it begins with them being notified of the death of their parents). They are taken in by an uncle on the other side of town who is quite a bit more than he seems, and all of the \\"more\\" is dedicated to separating the children from the sizable fortune the eldest holds in trust. All standard stuff, to be sure, but like the best mystery novelists, Snicket will keep you guessing until the final few pages who's a part of the plot and who isn't.<br /><br />The Bad Beginning is, in fact, a fine beginning. *** ½nd who isn't. <br /> <br />The Bad Beginning is, in fact, a fine beginning. *** 
B000002H97|5.0|I'm just having a good laugh at some of the reviews by so called &quot;fans&quot;. This is THE best metallica album, and to call them a &quot;sellout&quot; just cause they happened to sell alot of copies is rubbish. This is full of the best songs, &quot;sad but true&quot; would have to be one of the best riffs ever. This cd has it all, and it is everything metallica are about.
B00004VXF2|5.0|Lou Reed, Metal Machine Music (RCA, 1975)<br /><br />Three scant months after the release of Lou Reed Live, fans found themselves looking at another Lou Reed album. No doubt they snatched it up unheard. And what they got was, to say the least, not what they were expecting. (Reportedly, the album sold 100,000 copies, and still holds the record for the highest rate of return for an American record.)<br /><br />Metal Machine Music was the first noise album to actually get decent distribution (various noise and proto-noise bands, among them The Residents and the Nihilist Spasm Band, were already recording, but anything they actually got to record stores was more commercially accessible than this), and paved the way for much of what was to come after it; within four years, three of the finest noise bands on the planet would take shape (all of whom, amazingly, are still recording today): NON, Whitehouse, and Merzbow. How much any of the three were influenced by Reed's seminal work is unknown, but it's hard to argue with the chronology.<br /><br />It's been thirty years since the release of Metal Machine Music, and those intervening years haven't done a thing to change its brilliance. Reed's masterwork is a lot more \\"pure\\" than most of the noise records that followed, containing neither the low-end chaos popular in American and Japanese noise today or the shrieking high frequencies of powerelectronics popular among European purveyors. This is exactly what the title claims it to be; mid-range (with a few high frequencies mixed in here and there) heavily-distorted tone generation, with A=440 drones laid over shifting, bubbling masses of noise at surrounding frequencies. While most unfamiliar with noise, like any other genre, are probably going to claim the whole hour's worth sounds similar, a closer listen will reveal the excellent dynamics of the work; things shift in and out, tones are born and die, the structure collapses and is rebuilt, time and again. While Metal Machine Music lacks the classical-symphony structure of some of noise's greatest works, it's certainly not one continuous sixty-minute drone. It's an earlier, shorter, not quite as concussive Akasha Gulva (Merzbow's fantastic 1996 release that must be heard-- or better, experienced live-- to believe). That it was so desperately shunned by the record-buying public is a travesty, but probably to be expected in a world where roller disco was king. Not that things have changed much; Mandy Moore outsells Merzbow every time.<br /><br />A must-have for noise fans, and a must-listen for non-noise fans. Those of you who have never been exposed may find yourselves surprisingly impressed. Why you should be surprised, I don't know; after all, it's Lou Reed, isn't it? **** ½Machine Music lacks the classical-symphony structure of some of noise's greatest works, it's certainly not one continuous sixty-minute drone.

0380789035|1.0|There is absolutely nothing to recommend this book. The idea is old and has been done several times before, to much better effect. The characters are two-dimensional, dull and unreal- if the author knows anything about humanity, he's not showing it. The actual plot (fragmented, dull and thin as it is) ends at least 100 pages before the book itself, maddeningly dragging on with an unfinished idea from much earlier on, finally finishing on a note that strains to be profound but just comes off random, stupid and unnecessary. Save your money, time and mental peace that comes from not wasting the first two on a worthless example of thoroughly incompetant writing.
B000286S8S|3.0|Since VH just released a &quot;Greatest Hits Volume 1&quot; a few years ago, I assumed a Volume 2 would show up eventually. Instead we got this. Granted, this compilation brought in numerous songs that should have been in Volume 1, but it still comes up way short. Where are the great guitar shorts like Spanish Fly and 316? How about the greatest VH song of all time (IMHO) Cabo Wabo!?!? In the 3 VH concerts I have been to, no song gets the crowd going like Cabo, yet it is missing from this set. The new songs are pretty weak, and could easily be replaced by older stuff that would better complete this set. I would have preferred a Volume 2 with stuff they left off the first greatest hits, but since I love VH I picked this up anyway. Maybe they will put together a live album after this tour.
B00005JM1F|3.0|Not Will Ferrell's masterpiece, but pretty funny when he is on screen.  Ferrell plays Hank, the unhappily married guy who leaves life as he knows it, PARTY.  This is not Razor's Edge at all, but has its moments. Vince Vaughn added much as Beanie, the angry calculating friend who predicted Frank's marriage going south.  Luke Wilson is fine as Mitch, the one straight man of the bunch.  THIS IS NO INNOCENT COLLEGE FILM, IT IS R-RATED FOR GOOD FREAKIN REASON.  Most of it, being Will's off the wall dialogue and other antics, including:  Cursing out pledges, hosting female wrestling, streaking, ingesting tranquilizers, and a litany of other moments.  Vaughn is no less innocent, and even Mitch hazes the guys- cinderblock, rope, and it being tied to an important male appendage.  IF you're out for family fare, turn the car around.  If you want to see Will act strange, and even gross, and see everyone else wallow in the crapulence, this is your film.  Enjoy!
B0002858YS|5.0|Some may argue that The Killers can be placed into a genre of the many other &quot;the&quot; bands such as The Strokes, The Hives, The Stills, The Shins, etc. But honestly that arguement could be used for any genre of music, and trust me, you'll find the Killers to be a very unique band even though it mind remind you of Duran,Duran. &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; is nothing short of an awesome CD. On that four hour road trip, I found myself listening to it over and over, memorizing the catchy lyrics. I had bought it on a whim after hearing a clip of &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot; on the radio. It was on sale at Best Buy and I found myself loving the entire CD. It's fresh and fun and when I popped it into the stereo at a friend's house everyone stopped to listen. Somebody got it right. Listen to a few clips and see if you agree. This is definitely a CD worth making a fuss about.
B00005JN2F|2.0|The movie could have been great - but the director killed it by filming it like a motion sickness ride that shakes the camera during every action sequence. I guess this is a good way to save money because you cant actually see anything on the screen. <br /> <br />Basically, the movie could have been great, BUT THE DIRECTOR KILLED IT WITH THE WORST CAMERA WORK EVER!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I had bought Gavin Degraw's first cd a couple weeks after it came out and instantly fell in love with it. The lyrics are amazing and his voice just blends with the music and takes you away. I actually got a chance to watch him perform in my town, Dewey Beach, DE, and he proved himself to be just as heart-stirring as on his first CD. This CD, Chariot Stripped, is my all time favorite in my entire collection. I've never heard anyone sing as emotionally as Gavin. You can feel how passionate he is. Honestly, I could listen to this CD endlessly. It was definatly one of my best buys.
0385507755|4.0|These days there is so much to distract one from finishing a book.  A Million Little Pieces does not lend itself to distraction.  I rarely skip reading the newspaper, particularly the Sunday papers, in order to get back to a book I have started, but that is what happened with James Frey's compelling story of how he pulled himself out of hell.  Though most of us know someone with a drinking problem, at least, if not a drug problem, and many of us have had some experience of a friend going off to Rehab, very few of us have actually lived through the experience, and heard the stories.  The achingly sad stories.  Frey does a marvelous job of conveying the stories, from the point of view of the Patients in Treatment, to the people trying to help, including the staff and the families.  I stronlgy recommend this book, whether or not you think the subject matter is of interest.  I assure you, you won't put it down after you read the first page. <br /> <br />Susan -- Washington DC
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The first beatle album i ever heard was st. peppers lonely heart club band and i have been a complete fan ever since. my friend gave me this #1 cd and i thought it was great and worth listening to, i fell in love with Hey Jude. In february i bought all thier albums because i realized that they werent just a band, which many young people probably think, they were amazing songwriters. the beatles have inspired me in so many ways in my life from my songwriting to guitar playing to all other aspects in my life, no one has ever had that effect on me. ya that may seem weird to some of you reading this but to those who know what im talking about, you get the picture. of course i have to agree with everyone else that this album is missing some of thier best work, i cant even list a song because i'll probably just keep going on and on. but its a #1 album, which means all those songs that we fans love, that didnt quite make it to #1, arent on it. i highly suggest this album to anyone just getting into the beatles, because youll get a taste of the magic of the beatles, which i think is timeless forever. After you listen to it, buy some other albums from them. in my opinion rubber soul(65') and all albums after that start to show their most creativity. so to cut this to an end , get the album if your new to them or get the album just because your a big fan!! the beatles are the best band ever and this is coming from a 16 year old girl whos just tired of some of the crap today that my friends listen to. take care everyone <br /> <br />P.S. get the anthology dvd set because it sooo worth the money and has hours of entertainment!!! peace!!
B000063DGC|5.0|(Actual Rating- 4.5 Stars)<br /><br /> Tribute(1987). Ozzy Osbourne's Second Live Album Released, A Concert Played In 1981 With Original Guitarist Randy Rhoads.<br /><br /> Around 1982, after the successful releases of 'Blizzard of Ozz' and 'Diary of a Madman', while Ozzy, Randy Rhoads, and his band were on tour, Randy Rhoads' plane crashed into a tree, instantly killing him and everyone inside as the plane erupted into flames. The young guitar genuis died in his Late 20's, but his legacy lives on forever. Ozzy Osbourne, at the loss of his best friend, released a live recording from the 'Blizzard of Ozz' Tour in 1981 to comemmorate Randy Rhoads superlative guitar talents, and finally give his fans Live material featuring Rhoads. So, how does 'Tribute', Ozzy's only Live album featuring Randy Rhoads, stack up? Read on to find out!<br /><br /> Track Selection-<br /><br /> Since 'Tribute' was recorded during the 'Blizzard of Ozz' Tour, you can expect overkill when it comes to Track Selection. From 'Blizzard of Ozz', we get every track, including huge hits like 'Crazy Train', 'Mr. Crowely', and 'I Don't Know', sultry ballads like 'Goodbye To Romance', and 'Revelation(Mother Earth)', fast-paced Heavy Metal rockers like 'Believer', 'Steal Away(The Night)', 'Suicide Solution', and 'No Bone Movies'. From 'Diary of a Madman'(My favorite Ozzy Osbourne album), we get one lone track, 'Flying High Again', my personal favorite Ozzy song! Since Ozzy has always been obsessed with his Black Sabbath material, we get the complimentary tracks 'Iron Man', 'Children of the Grave', and 'Paranoid'. Overall, while I enjoy the 'Blizzard of Ozz' tracks immensely, I seriously wonder why Ozzy didn't include more than one track off 'Diary of a Madman', as it's my favorite album! Plus this Live album lacks material from all of Ozzy's later albums too! 3.5/5<br /><br /> Sound Quality-<br /><br /> 'Tribute' has Sound Quality like you'd expect from a Live Recording, and by that, I mean it's RAW! Ozzy's vocals are precise and mimic the studio counterparts perfectly, Randy Rhoads' guitar is crisp and clear, and easily hearable. The backup band sounds easy to hear, and you can easily notice they're there! Overall the Sound Quality, while certainly not the best I've ever heard, isn't bad, simply good. 4/5<br /><br /> Band Performance- With 'Tribute', what everybody's interested in, is if Ozzy and Rhoads ROCK! And you know what? They DO! Randy Rhoads dishes out outstanding solos, his technical mastery of Neo-Classical Metal Guitar blaring out the speakers in their full glory, and his riffs easily equal the studio counterparts. It is also interesting to hear Rhoads takes on Black Sabbath classics, and while they don't always seem &quot;right&quot;, the guitar nonetheless works outstanding! Ozzy sounds just like he does on the albums, with that sarcastic sneering vocals that can only belong to him! The backup band plays flawlessly, and I have NO complaints with their excellent performance!<br /><br /> Overall, 'Tribute' is an excellent Live album, while having its flaws, when it comes to crunch time, the band, most importantly, Rhoads, plays their hearts out, and the songs, while not as good as their studio counterparts, are excellent nonetheless, and 'Tribute' is essential to fans of Ozzy and Black Sabbath. While the sound is a tad &quot;raw&quot;, and not the best sound quality I've ever heard, and the Track Selection is the entire album of 'Blizzard of Ozz' with a few &quot;Bonus Tracks&quot;, if you can look past those problems 'Tribute' is an excellent Live album.<br /><br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR FANS OF OZZY OSBOURNE, RANDY RHOADS, GUITAR, BLACK SABBATH, AND HARD ROCK/HEAVY METAL! THIS IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO HEAR RANDY RHOADS LIVE, AND I SUGGEST YOU TAKE IT!<br /><br /> Killer Kuts- &quot;Crazy Train&quot;, &quot;Mr. Crowely&quot;, &quot;Flying High Again&quot;, and &quot;Paranoid&quot;.<br /><br /> Also Recommended-<br /><br /> Just Say Ozzy- Ozzy Osbourne<br/><br /> Blizzard of Ozz- Ozzy Osbourne<br /><br /> Reunion- Black Sabbath<br /><br /> Thanks For Reading!t Say Ozzy- Ozzy Osbourne <br /> Blizzard of Ozz- Ozzy Osbourne <br /> Reunion- Black Sabbath <br />  <br /> Thanks For Reading! <br />  <br />
B00008GKEG|5.0|i just want to make this short but its the best i ever bought!!!!!!!!!!  buy it its sooooo worth it !!!!
B000003TA4|5.0|The CD, that started it all.. breaking Grunge and Alternative Rock into the Mainstream.  The 80's brought us music like MJ and glam rock.  Nirvana answered our prayers and brought decent music back to the mainstream.  This CD has so much power being able to start a whole new generation of music.   <br /> <br />Anyone will like this album, not only fans of Grunge, but diverse fans will love this CD.  It may not be Nirvana's best, but it still got them on the map.   <br /> <br />Smells Like Teen Spirit- instant classic, not Nirvana's best, but achieved mass fame, and is still a great song, love the geetar solo 10/10 <br /> <br />In Bloom- its an excellent song, the lyrics are amazing and so is the MV 10/10 <br /> <br />Come As You Are- very popular, i personally get sick of it fast 7/10 <br /> <br />Breed- musically its.. decent, lyrically.. disastrous 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Lithium- amazing song, one of my favorites, i love the lyrics 10/10 <br /> <br />Polly- i like it.. it gets repetive but its still really good 9/10 <br /> <br />Territorial Pissings- it's filler.. and i dont know why, but i like it anyway 8/10 <br /> <br />Drain You- my personal favorite, the guitar is amazing, the lyrics are amazing, awesome power cords, you have to listen to it 11/10 <br /> <br />Lounge Act- my second favorite song on it, krist's bass in the beggining is amazing, and i love the chorus 10/10 <br /> <br />Stay Away- very repetitive.. its different... in a good way 8.5/10 <br /> <br />On A Plain- really good, im not a big fan of the chorus, but the verses are unbelievable 9/10 <br /> <br />Something in the Way- too slow for me, very repetitive, but has its ups 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JLO2|2.0|Although this movie felt too long, I enjoyed Heath Ledger and Wes Bentley's performances. Kate Hudson, however, was terrible. Her character was so uninspiring that it was impossible to believe that either of these men would have the strong feelings for her that the story hinged on. <br />Kate Hudson is the next Ashley Judd, and I don't mean that as a compliment.
B0000060NH|4.0|Marvin long considered his score to the forgotten film TROUBLE MAN to be his best work.  While I would not call it his best (could anything really top WHAT'S GOING ON, LET'S GET IT ON, or HERE, MY DEAR?), it is a fantastic album in it's own right.  Textured and atmospheric, this lovely, complex score deserved to be featured in a much better movie.  It's often compared with the ground-breaking soundtracks SHAFT and SUPERFLY, however TROUBLE MAN is much more poised and intricate than those funk classics.  It sounds more like a bittersweet separation, rather than a head-on collision.  Though largely instrumental, TROUBLE MAN does contain the hit title song (#7 Pop, #2 R&B), which is justifiably considered one of Gaye's classic singles.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|Romantic comedies are not typically my favorite movies, but this one saved my sanity when I was separated from my husband for 5 months during a relocation. No matter how bad my day had been, how late it was when I finally returned from work to my lonely rented room, Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline always made me laugh out loud. Having spent a lot of time in France certainly helped the humor resonate with me (especially the scene on the airplane when they first meet). But, I would recommend this movie to those without travel experience, as well. Most of us have had at least one relationship experience that involved chasing someone we thought we couldn't live without, only to find him unappealing in the end (perhaps wearing a God-awful white suit and making a complete fool of himself in public?).
B00007FOMP|5.0|This album is so truly brilliant, I hardly know where to begin.  Beautifully melodic and lyrically pained, WHAT'S GOING ON is as timely and as surprising today as it was when originally released more than thirty years ago.  It single-handedly broke down doors and allowed recording artists to write and sing about issues that were close to their heart, no matter how controversial.   <br /> <br />Musically, the album is nothing short of breathtaking.  Every single song is a classic, and they combine to form a master work.  Three smash hits were scored from the album - the gorgeous title track (#2 Pop, #1 R&B), \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\\" (#4 Pop, #1 R&B), and \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\\" (#9 Pop, #1 R&B) - and as exceptional as they are, any other track here is just as terrific.   <br /> <br />The eerily post-modern \\"Flyin' High,\\" the light funk of \\"Right On,\\" and the tender sentiments of \\"God Is Love\\" and \\"Wholly Holy\\" are all brilliant, as is the entire record.  All of Gaye's fans have their personal favorite among the tracks (the one that always speaks to them the most) and mine is easily the heartbreaking \\"Save The Children.\\"  The reverent qualities of that pulsating, ethereal track are present throughout the entire disc.  WHAT'S GOING ON is not only a masterpiece of music, it is a masterpiece of art in any media. <br />
B0000C6E4D|1.0|Like some other reviewers, this is my least favourite Sarah McLachlan album. It sounds like its time for Sarah to break free from partner/producer Pierre Marchand. They've made some beautiful music together over the years but this is a retread.
B000069HKH|5.0|Although this album has a different flavor from the classic Springsteen songs, I still found it to be remarkable! It's refreshing to see a singer spread their wings a bit and try something new. As the title of this review states, I found The Rising to be a powerful album, with songs that had very deep and meaningful lyrics. &quot;Paradise&quot; never fails to bring a tear to my eye, no matter how many times I listen to it. The lyrics to the songs, in my opinion, are pure poetry. The song that really stands out for me, though, is &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;. It's a very different style from Springsteen's past songs, and even from the other songs on this CD. It's very unique, and I love listening to it.<br /><br /> The whole album carries an important message about having hope and faith, which is very poignant to the times. There are songs that will give you chills or bring you to tears, but the overall album is very uplifting and comforting. It's one of Bruce Springsteen's best, if not THE best. If you listened to it and got nothing out of it, listen to it again. You would have to be made of stone to not be able to relate to the feelings expressed in at least one of the songs. ~~ Laura Pfalz, author of &quot;Going Down Memory Lane&quot;
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I just recently saw Gavin live for the first time in New Orleans, and I must say that he is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I have been addicted to his original release of &quot;Chariot&quot; since last September, but when I heard of this live recording, and heard him, I had to get it. This kid is overflowing with talent. He brought down the roof at House of Blues, along with Marc Broussard and Toby Lightman (who are equally--almost--as awesome and if you haven't heard them, DO!!) He is going to be around for a long time, so long as he continues writing, recording, and performing. Take the time to listen and you will be as impressed as I am. He's by far my favorite artist right now, and I don't think things will change either. Plus, he seemed like a great person when I met him after the show. GAVIN ROCKS!
B000059TEP|5.0|It's got a very unique premise, and Whoopi Goldberg is often pretty funny in this movie. It's a classic.
B000096I9G|5.0|The pornography set sounds amazing, much better than on the murky album when the band was not as experienced.  Even the 2 bonus tracks, especially \\"The Kiss\\", sound awesome.  The picture quality is quite incredible;  I had to magnify quite a bit to notice any grain.  And the camera work is nicely done.  The performances are also pitch perfect and precise, so if you didn't like the \\"Show\\" or \\"Paris\\" albums for their improvisational qualities and off-beatedness, this is for you.  A great buy.
B00005JKBC|2.0|I think Tony Scott is secretly a woman and you can tell whenever it's his time of the month because it's his time of the month when his movies suck. That's the only thing that would explain how he can make movies so amazingly good as The Last Boy Scout, Top Gun and especially Crimson Tide, and then turn around and make movies as horrifically bad as this and True Romance.
B00008EY65|4.0|I've never read the &quot;Hellboy&quot; comics. I have nothing to base a comparison on as such, so I'll review this movie as a person who just happened to pick this one up not knowing what to expect. What a surprise! This is an action-packed, but tender-hearted romp through the life of one of the kindest, cockiest heroes of our time. Ron Perlman is perfect as Hellboy. He manages to show us just how gruff and mean Hellboy can be, but he exposes the heart that lies inside our hero as well.<br /><br /> The rest of the cast is superb. Selma Blair has the quiet, stand-offish stereotype down pat. Doug Evans(though you can't see him with all of that make-up) is witty and engaging as Abe Sapien. John Hurt is excellent as Hellboy's &quot;father.&quot;<br /><br /> The story takes you on a rollercoaster of a ride with the paranormal gang hunting down Rasputin(yes, that Rasputin). Along the way we are introduced to a freakish Nazi assassin, some hellhounds, and a dead guy named Ivan. What you get in the end is an action flick full of comedy and heart. If your kids can handle the violence of flicks like &quot;MIB&quot; and &quot;Tremors,&quot; I think they can handle this. The language isn't too severe. I don't remember any &quot;f&quot; bombs being dropped at all.<br /><br /> Guillermo del Toro takes the slick, cool-looking set design and story movement of &quot;Blade 2&quot; and tosses it into this movie minus all of the techno music. Characters are developed well, and the story moves at a quick pace.<br /><br /> Overall, a great film to watch, even if you don't know who Hellboy is. The DVD isn't that shabby either, what with being loaded to the nines with extras for film and comic buffs alike.<br /><br /> I highly recommend this flick to everyone who enjoys comedy, action and maybe even a little horror.
B0000009RT|4.0|The court-jester of the rock and roll world brings the stark reality of 1960' U.S. suburbia to your stereo. TV dinners, race riots and the mass slaughter of freaks - the REAL 1960's IN YOUR FACE.
B00026WUBE|4.0|Planet Waves is definitely a worthy Dylan album with the Band. With awesome sweet tunes like &quot;Hazel&quot; and &quot;You Angel You&quot;, you almost need this. &quot;On a Night Like This&quot; is almost a sequel to the New Morning opener &quot;If Not For You&quot;, that's cool stuff. It's also cool how they carry on with &quot;Forever Young&quot;. I don't know about buying the SACD version of this...just buy this one, unless you have SACD player or you NEED to hear a better mastering. 4.5 stars because this isn't as essential as &quot;Blood on Tracks&quot; or the old stuff. But it comes darn close.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|If you enjoy watching black leather-clad morons spray trillions of bullets around, skip this and see _The Matrix_ again. If you like the concept of an updated vampire movie, see _Blade_ again. But at all costs skip this waste of a DVD. Unless I fell asleep during a key exposition sequence (which is possible), I could not make sense of the vampire mythos in this movie. Vampires - immortal creatures - need 'awakening' (resuscitating)? Are they just too lazy to deal with the day-to-day drudgery of immortality? Vampires can faint from *blood loss*? Vampires need CPR after near-drowning events? (Ask yourself during this scene: isn't drowning, being defined as a suppression of the oxygenation of blood, really more of a problem for the living than the undead?) Advice to the Lycans: skip the expensive UV bullets, hit the Home Depot, and attack the vampire HQ with $59.99 chainsaws. Even better, just flood it using $9.99 garden hoses. Worth seeing for a number of laughable sequences, including one in which Beckinsale expends about 1,100 rounds from two handheld automatic pistols to create a Looney Tunes-style hole in the floor to jump down through. (I can suspend my disbelief of Hollywood clip sizes unless I have a scene like this shoved in my face...); also to hear grown people discuss the Lycans in abject fear, although if you're just sitting down to this movie with a bowl of popcorn, you might, like me, hear 'lichens' in your head. (&quot;The lichens! My god, the lichens! They're...slowly growing on mountainside rocks!&quot;) Beckinsale in leather is the only redeeming quality. Keep the rest on 8x FF in your DVD player.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I guess marketing surveys convinced the directors that the best parts of the now legendary original were the fight sequences rather than the brilliant concept.  So, we get about 4 just in the first hour with logic out the window.  Starting in Zion which we assume is TOTALLY disconnected from the Matrix, agent programs, like all other programs that can only run IN the Matrix attack Neo.  Then a fight erupts as part of the screening process to see the Oracle whereas only a knock on the door was necessary in the first.  Then that Agent Smith who gave Neo so much trouble in the first film is replicated hundreds on times, yet gives Neo LESS trouble in this film.  Not that it mattered as Neo flies away superman style to conclude it,  causing one to wonder why he didn't just do that to begin with.<br /><br />This film represents an utter betrayal of all the fans of the first film who had every right to expect something superior from these directors.  And after 4 years this is all they could come up with?<br /><br />As I said, it opens in Zion where life has to be gruelling as Morpheus has gained about 40 pounds!  A meeting with a governing body has me thinking 'I'm in Star Wars!', expecting Luke and Leia to give subservient homage.  After a speech that one of LBJ's Vietnam peptalks would have outshone, a dance breaks out and 'I'm in 'Saturday Night Fever!'.<br /><br />We have to deal with the Myrillingian (did Merrill Lynch back out of their financial committments?), as nauseating a character ever committed to film even if his wife is Monica Bellucci in order to get to the Key Master and I expect Rick Moranis and Sigorney Weaver to emerge!<br /><br />The brilliant concept that was gradually opened up for us in the first film is nowhere to be found here.  What is left is a film that could only appeal to someone under 15, which I would guess WAS the intended target audience!
B00009ATKS|5.0|If I had to use one word to describe this album it would be &quot;Epic&quot;. This album has no lyrics. It is all instrumental rock that has an epic sound. I knew this band is ocming on tour wit The Cure so I wanted to know something about them before they arrived and I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this album. The osund is very reminiscent of Radio head, that laid back, full flovored rock sound that makes you want to curl up and relax only this one has no lyrics. I highly recommend this album.
B000002KHH|4.0|Given its influence on heavy metal (and rock in general), it is difficult to overate this album, even though to the uninformed (meaning: Ozzy-only), it is the only album Black Sabbath ever released and, honestly, the reunited original lineup could probably make millions just going onstage for half an hour and playing &quot;War Pigs&quot;, &quot;Paranoid&quot; and &quot;Iron Man&quot;. Actually, I think Sharon Osbourne may have them doing just that! <br />  <br /> Nonetheless, even though the most popular tracks can be found on various compilations, this really is a must-own. This is the first Sabbath album I ever heard and the second one I ever owned, after &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;. I played it at night as a 15-year-old in 1981 and it scared me, no kidding. Countless plays later (in fact, I'm playing it as I write this), it no longer scares me, but I can see how it would still have the power to do so to the uninitiated. <br />  <br /> The songs on here are so well-known it is difficult to give a track-by-track breakdown that has not been given many times before but I will try. <br />  <br /> &quot;War Pigs&quot; - Contains all the Sabbath trademarks: crushing Iommi power chords, the tight-but-loose Butler/Ward rhythm section and Ozzy's keening, if tuneless, voice. Vietnam-era lyrics that are still apropos in today's wartime environment. <br />  <br /> &quot;Paranoid&quot; - Probably Sabbath's best-known single track. The band's first (and last?) genuine &quot;hit single&quot;. A 2.50 long catchy tune about losing one's mind. <br />  <br /> &quot;Planet Caravan&quot; - Along with &quot;Solitude&quot;, Ozzy's strangest vocal. Stoner rock typical of the period. Good variation from an otherwise unremittingly heavy album. Recalls the first album's jazzy leanings with a clean Iommi solo. I also believe that's him playing piano in the background and some odd percussion (congas?) from Ward. <br />  <br /> &quot;Iron Man&quot; - &quot;I AM IRON MAN!&quot; What else can you say? One of Iommi's most recognisable riffs, sci-fi lyrics and chock-full of Sabbath's trademark tempo and key changes (indeed, this band had more complexity than they were given credit for). <br />  <br /> &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; - The wildest use of a wah-wah pedal outside of Jimi Hendrix. More &quot;death and destruction&quot; lyrics with quasi-Satanic lyrics used in a political context. <br />  <br /> &quot;Hand Of Doom&quot; - An anti-drug song, which is kind of odd considering that at this time the band was indulging in most of the illicit substances known to man! Probably my favourite track on the album, driven along by Geezer's bass. Dark, moody and heavy, just as Sabbath should be. <br />  <br /> &quot;Rat Salad&quot; - This track was an influence on an early incarnation of Van Halen; they originally called themselves &quot;Rat Salade&quot;. A goodish instrumental showcasing Bill Ward, though he really is a better percussionist within the context of Sabbath's songs rather than as a soloist. <br />  <br /> &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot; - Good in headphones, especially the intro! Along with the title track, probably the most melodic track on the album and also some jazzy leanings toward the end. I have always thought it was about an acid trip, but I have also read that it was a &quot;subtle go at skinheads&quot;, as the band's original manager, Jim Simpson, has been quoted as saying. <br />  <br /> As with many early Black Sabbath albums, there are two &quot;hidden&quot; (nonexistent?) tracks, &quot;Luke's Wall&quot; at the end of &quot;War Pigs&quot; and &quot;Jack The Stripper&quot; at the beginning of &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot;. I can't figure out what these might be except that maybe &quot;Luke's Wall&quot; is the bit at the end of &quot;War Pigs&quot; that sounds like a 33 rpm record sped up to 78 rpm and that &quot;Jack The Stripper&quot; is Iommi's guitar intro to &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot;. <br />  <br /> Again, though I don't like itthat many people seem to think this is the only album Sabbath ever did and that it's really an Ozzy album with three supporting players, it is an essential item in one's collection, if you are interested in Sabbath, the evolution of rock guitar (Tony Iommi is one of the few true innovators of this instrument) or the evolution of rock music in general.
B000148KK2|5.0|&quot;The Girl In the Other Room&quot; marks Diana Krall's first attempt at recording and performing her own music. She does not fall short in her efforts and creates a wonderful album of guaranteed new jazz classics. <br />  <br /> Krall's soothing voice fills her songs with an emotion and feeling that is indescribable except to the listener. The title track relaxes the listener while &quot;Love Me Like A Man&quot; and &quot;I'm Coming Through&quot; give a little more excitment and energy than most of the chill tracks. Highlight songs include &quot;Departure Bay&quot; and &quot;Black Crow&quot;. <br />  <br /> This is a great CD and an essential one to any jazz collection. Perfect for sharing a bottle of wine with a couple of close friends.
B00005JM02|2.0|I don't care how good the graphics are, any cartoon which contains so much death and violence in the first 10 minutes is not something I would recommend for parents of any children. <br />I am not advocating removal of violence in movies - I like cowboy flicks and cop shows, but for heaven's sake - where was the fun in this story? My mother and I - both of whom are far old enough to know good movies when we see them - were shocked at how depressing the cartoon was. I don't know nor care how the rest of the film was - we won't be watching any sequels nor recommending it to anyone! <br />It was perfectly ghastly.
B000088E6D|4.0|Michael Buble marks his entrance into the music world with his self-titled freshman album. After only one listen, any listener will know Buble is an up-and-coming singer who has talent to spare. <br /> <br />He covers many well-known songs in the album which he performs with the vigor and energy expected of these classics. He does a pretty good good considering he is singing songs of such greats as Sinatra, Bobby Darin and Dean Martin. This is to his credit although it would be nice to see Buble take a bigger risk on his next album and not go with songs that are so widely popular. <br /> <br />Overall, a good album but let's hope his next one will be more adventurous in his repetoire.

B00003CXCT|5.0|...I gave five stars to the movies as I saw them in the theater when George Lucas re-released them. I liked the improvements. I saw them as mostly aesthetic. I see the WHOLE MOVIES as mostly aesthetic. The plots aren't all that complex. The reason they're so mythological is because, at their core, myths aren't all that complex. They don't need to be. I don't want to analyze Han Solo's motivations; I want to see him blow stuff up. Some people obviously disagree, but that's because they're so far into this &quot;Star Wars is our modern mythology&quot; baloney that for them, changing Star Wars is like changing the Scriptures. As the producer, George Lucas reserves the right to tweak his movies and characters any way he wants. He can turn Han Solo into a good guy, bad guy, or even make Chewbacca into Han's girlfriend if he wants to. If we don't like it, too bad. Why are we putting all our mental energy into the Star Wars universe when we should be making up our own universes anyway?
0393314804|5.0|The fact that this is Irvine Welsh's first novel is completely amazing by itself. The fact that this book is well-written, interesting, and original only serves to augment the fact that Welsh is a talented writer. A lot of writers' first novels aren't so great, which is certainly not the case with Trainspotting. It gives an interesting story while making commentary on drugs and sex and friendship, something that most people can relate to. Welsh has created an interesting story that people will enjoy and relate to for a long time. And if you can't let the characters go, there's a sequel: Porno (of which I read about half. I didn't stop reading because of boredom and will definetly finish soon). Trainspotting is original, refreshing, and thoughtful and despite its gritty exterior, it definetly has more to say and offer besides just sex, drugs, and rock n roll.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This movie is just pure excellence! Everything from the plot to the motives and characters just blends together so well this is hands down the best John Mctiernan(sorry, spelled wrong) film and in my opinon the best action movie ever!!! Most people say Die Hard is a cheesy movie, which I could agree some parts (Air Shaft Scene) are a little cheesy but overall it isn't. I think horrible movies like Die Hard 2: Die Harder are cheesy movies though. (thank god Mcteirnan didnt direct that one) Fellow Die Hard fans look forward for the Eniment sequel of Die Hard 4: Die Hardest. ( Mcteirnan is directing, schwing!) Lets pray its GOOD!

0784011176|1.0|Jane Campion's &quot;The Piano&quot; comes across as nothing more than a pretentious and dull piece of melo-dramatic cinema. Its only saving grace is the beutiful cinematography of New Zealand's untamed wilderness and a strong performance by Harvey Keitel. <br />  <br /> One finds it hard to associate with either Ada (Holly Hunter) or her pretentious daughter Flora (Anna Paquin.) Their prudish and overly self-righteous personalities simply evoke no sympathy. One can only take so much of a capricious girl going into screaming tantrums with every other scene. One comes out feeling that if Ada's beloved piano and previous cozy life were so important to her she should have stayed home in Scotland instead of coming to the jungles of New Zealand. <br />  <br /> Harvey Keitel's performance as the half-Maori mysogenist was the only decent role in the movie. Overall, a very forgettable melo-drama about a prudish woman with a pretentious and insolent daughter who both feel that life in the colonies should revolve only around their needs. A real yawner where the only things that keep you awake are the overly irritating temper tantrums of Anna Paquin's character. Spare yourselves the irritation: watch a Discovery special on New Zealand, put it on mute, and listen to Chopin or Schubert and you'll have a much better movie that you can also properly title &quot;The Piano&quot;. <br />
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|Don't mess with D-Twizzy. <br />this is something I'll recomment it. <br />to all the thugz.
B00004YYDI|2.0|Luc Besson's film on the relationship between a professional hitman (Jean Reno) and an orphaned girl(Natalie Portman)who seeks protection from the murderous rampage of a corrupt narcotics cop(Gary Oldman.) There are several problems with both the plot and theme of this movie which, taken together, make the film both unrealistic and perverse.<br /><br />  First of all, there is nothing professional about the supposed professional hitman played by Jean Reno; as the character portrayed seems to suffer from retardation and ineptitude. An otherwise professional sociopath suddenly has a heart for a defenseless little girl? But it doesn't stop there. The relationship between Portman and Reno has strong sexual overtones which Besson intentionally emphasized by the mood of the dialogue and, most importantly, the very suggestive camera angles on Nataly Portman: the continuous angling of the camera on Portman's hips, waste, crotch, and rear, makes this theme all too clear. The movie therefore presents pedophilic sentiments as normal and legitimate. Sorry, but a film on the lustful woes of a 40+ year old deranged assassin for a young 10-12 year old girl isn't worth a second look. The best performance in the film is by Gary Oldman who plays the corrupt police officer.<br /><br />  Altogether a pretentious film that, due to its perverted theme, has absolutely no redeeming value. The plot itself is too absurd to be credible. Rent if if you must but I wouldn't buy it.
0385510438|4.0|4 1/2 stars to be more precise. I won't bother with a description of the story it's been done a million times already. Suffice to say that if you enjoy well written novels with wonderful characterizations you will treasure this latest effort by John Grisham. Though I have read all his works I, like many others I presume, have felt a little short changed in the last few years. However, The Last Juror certainly ranks with the best he's authored and it's wonderful to see him truly back in form.
B00005221M|5.0|Michael Mann's 1992 film of James Fenimore Cooper's novel is brilliant work in every way. From the cinematography to the acting and costumes, the film takes the audience back to the adventurous wilderness of 18th century America. <br /> <br />Daniel Day Lewis is brilliant as Hawkeye, the American settler whose blood ties to the Mohicans make him more of an Indian than a colonist. The film is filled with immaculate choreography of 18th century warfare and faithfully replicates all costumes and armaments. Wes Studi as Magua delivers an impeccable performance as the embodiment of hatred and revenge. Do not miss this brilliant film! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Before I start this review, I'll just say that I expected this to suck because I hate Ashton Kutcher. He used to be just another funny and entertaining guy when he was in &quot;Dude, Where's My Car?&quot; and on &quot;That 70's Show&quot;, but then he started &quot;Punk'd&quot; and since then he has annoyed the s*it out of me. But for some reason I watched this movie with a friend anyway. <br />  <br /> It's definetly confusing and bizarre as hell at first. Quick edits representing black-outs that leaves you wondering what happened. Let me explain. The movie starts with Kutcher's character, Evan, as a kid. Is shows that he often has black-outs and can't remember what happened, just like his Father did. One day, Evan draws a picture of himself on top of a pile of dead bodies with a knife, which catches his teacher's attention and she calls Evan's Mom. Evan's Dad was a psycho, or at least everyone thoughthe was, and Evan's Mom starts to worry that her son has caught his Father's &quot;sickness&quot;, and only furthers her belief in that when she catches Evan standing in the kitchen with a knife, for no apparent reason. Also in his child-hood, Evan is tricked by his best friend's Dad to strip down and get into his 'Robin Hood' movie, just an excuse for his friend's Dad to get a little kiddie porno. <br />  <br /> Then we fast forward a few years and Evan's probably around 13 or 14. His best friend, the girl who's Dad took the video of, and her sadistic brother and their other friend decide to blow up a toy doll house, which, in the end, has severe consequences. Also in this time-span the sadistic brother named Tommy torches Evan's dog and beats up a kid at the movies with a pole. Seems like the filmmakes wanted an excuse to be as senselessly offensive as possible so far, huh? Well, in the end, all of this does add up and the reason for showing all this is revealed. <br />  <br /> We fast-forward again and Evan is now in college with his goth roommate, who's pretty freaky, but he has some good music playing. Evan's life has been good; no black-outs for a number of years and he's almost completely forgotten about his childhood problems, that is until he brings a girl back to his dorm who gets him to read her his diaries he'd been keeping since he was 7. That's when we learn that Evan can time travel, in a way.  <br />  <br /> Eventually, Evan starts reading his journals which can take him back to the time when they happened, where he can try to fix it, then he will wake up in the situation he would have been in if he had 'fixed' it. However, there are always consequences either for him or for his friends and he can never seem to find a good outcome...until the end of the movie. I suggest watching the director's cut on the DVD because, even though the end is a little unbelievable, it is a better ending than that on the original theatrical version. <br />  <br /> So...is this an awesome movie? Not really. But it gets you to think and it's always fun to see how Evan turns out every time he tries to fix something. And the end of the director's cut will definetly get you. This is a good film for a Saturday night.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Peter Weir's &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; captures the audience into a seafaring adventure set in the Napoleanic Wars with great accuracy, and strong acting.      Russel Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey who commands the HMS Surprise to patrol the South Atlantic in search of the Acheron, an elusive French warship that is larger, faster, and has more cannon decks. Russell Crowe's bold command is often challenged by his friend and ship's surgeon played by Paul Bettany.      The film is mostly accurate as to details on sailing vessels of the 19th century as well as the types of tasks sailors had to undertake. The film shows that sailors were not only hoisting sails on ships but that each ship had specialists on board to tend to various matters: carpenters, blacksmiths, tailors, cooks, soldiers, etc. The film also accurately captures what tactics and battle conditions would have been like during that period of time. The only inaccuracy is where one ship is in pursuit of the other and the ship in front is blowing smoke: if one pays attention, one will see the smoke blowing back against the wind and towards the ship in pursuit. This presents a physical impossibility as the smoke would have to be blowing in the same direction as the wind and not against it.      Despite some technical inaccuracies, the film is exquisite in every way. The film is has good character development and the plot is well paced; I didn't feel the time pass. The film is rated PG-13 but the violence is not so light as to make it childish. I strongly recommend seeing this movie on the big screen.
B0000041DF|5.0|Now that I have your attention, I won't push the sexual innuendos any further, but Argerich's recording really does reach such limits of passion and excitement that it's difficult to think of another word to describe it.  <br /> <br />  I own several recordings of the Rach 3, and I enjoy each interpretation in its own way. However, if I had to pick just one interpretation, it has to be this one.  <br /> <br />  Her technique is nothing short of astonishing, and mistakes notwithstanding, there are few pianists alive or dead who can tinkle ivories as well as she can. All the time, you can just FEEL her energy. Even in the slow sections, you sense that she is bubbling just below the surface, but in the final movement, everything just explodes in a cascade of notes. Perhaps, she doesn't slow down to explore the nuances as much as Horowitz or Ashkenazy does, but the melancholy is always there even in the most explosive passages. Yes, there are mistakes, but as a musician myself I can say that mistakes ALWAYS happen in a live performances, and IMHO it merely adds to the vivaciousness of the recording. This is a documentation of a musical event, not an audiophile's spankfest.  <br /> <br />  Having seen live performances of the Rach 3, I know that it's no mere trifle for the conductor and orchestra to keep up with the pianist, so for Ricardo Chailly to not only keep up with her, but to mesh his orchestra with her playing in a coherent whole is priceless indeed.  <br /> <br />  It has been noted that the recording quality isn't the best, but I'd take the energy and sheer presence of the live recording at any time, and the applause at the end is something that really adds atmosphere. And trust me, after listening to this, you'll feel like giving a standing ovation yourself! <br /> <br />  The Tchaikovsky is another gem: the playing in the first movement is grand and sweeping, while the scherzo movement is an absolute joy to behold with its wit and lightness. This being Argerich, the final movement is of course brought off with her usual aplomb. I've heard several versions of this piece as well, and once again it's one of the best I know of.  <br /> <br />  With two great recordings in one album, this CD is a must-have.
1559409010|5.0|Monty Python's 1979 &quot;Life of Brian&quot; continues its tradition on making jabs at sacred cows as only the wacky British group can do: and what laughs they evoke! <br />  <br /> Although some may consider this to be a crude mockery of Christianity, it's not. As usual, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, John Cleese, and the rest of the gang inject their dark satirial humor on just about everything: their focus here is political and religious zealotry and nothing is sacred. Brian: &quot;No, I'm not the Messiah!&quot; Person in crowd: &quot;Only the Messiah would deny his true divinity!&quot; Indeed, after seeing this film, we get a good answer to the question, &quot;What have the bloody Romans really done for us?!&quot; <br />  <br /> Overall, another great comedy to own by England's most famous bards of comedy: don't miss it! <br />  <br />
B0001ZX0OM|3.0|This is a good movie the first time you see it, but after that there is no reason to watch it again.  Sean penn's performance although deserving of a nomination could have been better, i think johnny depp should have got it.  He shows emotion throughout, but in some scenes he lacks the right expressions to pull off the effect, the drama suffers becuase when he should be freaking out like in the scene when the cops are holding back(the best scene in the movie), he doesnt.  Tim robbins is good but also could have done better.  The story is average at best.  The ending is the biggest dissapointment and is very predictable, they should change it really.  The movie is an 8 out of a 10 the first time then goes down to a 3 the next.
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|An over-publicized production that wallows in a predictably boring plot conveying absolutely no theme. I disagree with the critics who claim that this is more than a simple 'who dunnit' film. The plot and character development being so shallow and disjointed, it's hard to find any of the deep meaning the critics are raving about.        The acting of Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon,and Tim Robbins is overblown for such a mediocre screenplay. The mystery of who killed Sean Penn's daughter is rather predictable making the characters' attempts at solving it seem amateurish if not idiotic. The story also focuses too much on issues that arose between the characters in the past that have absolutely no manifestation or relevance with their present dilemmas: they might as well have been complete strangers and the story would have had the same impact: none. Although critics praise the film as a complex exploration into the human psyche one never really gets that impression from the film. The characters and plot are too poorly developed to comprise a meaningful character study. What does Tim Robbins' past as a victim of pedophilia have to do with anything in this story? Absolutely nothing. Although it functions as a plot technique for suspense, it could have been just about any other traumatic experience to make the character seem odd, evasive, and suspect. The film focuses too much on this and makes it appear an important element when it really has very little relevance. In sum, the film's plot and theme are poorly woven: they have little to no logical relationship to each other and comprise little else than big a non-sequitur in logical reasoning.        This film is but a shallow, if not dry, river bed of a story with no character or thematic depth whatsoever. This by far has to be the most over-rated film of 2003. It deserved no Oscars.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Why did chicago win the best pic oscar, it should have gone to LOTR, but this ones a close second place.  The movie is great, all around.  The gang fights, the performances, the sets, the story, everything is masterfully crafted.  Scorcese makes another great movie(goodfellas, casino), they all kick a$$.  The only thing holding back this movie from being a 10 out of a 10 is the smut and the movie is seperated on 2 discs on the DVD, why its not that long really, if they can fit the green mile on one disc why not this one, i hate having to get up and change the disc.  Its a 9 out of a 10 for the movie because the smut and lack of one gang fight that i thought it could use in the middle to kind of even it out alittle.  Overall its a good movie worth owing, and probably Scorcese's best.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|Riefenstahl's documentary made for Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party to commemorate the 1934 Nurenburg rally: the official Nazi party convention. The documentary primarily covers the various parts of the rally including the opening and closing ceremonies.       It's important to emphasize that this 'documentary' was a propaganda film designed to stir popular sentiment and political empathy for the infamous political party: it's not a documentary. True documentaries are informative in purpose and neutral in content: they don't seek to persuade an audience to take any particular point of view or action. Documentaries have limited editing and are typically chronological in sequence (e.g. a Jacques Cousteau film.) This film is propaganda: its primary purpose is not to inform but to persuade an audience to accept a political ideology. All of the editing and composition of the film is geared solely towards that purpose: it was a rallying call for all Germans to join the party. The appearance of objectivity is arranged to persuade, not to objectively inform the audience.      If one understands the socio-political climate of Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s, one can clearly see what sentiments the film seeks to evoke and hence recognize its significance and brilliant execution. First of all, Nurenburg was one of the oldest towns in Germany and was strongly associated with German folklore and culture. The Nazi party chose this town as a convention point for that purpose: to emphasize its desire to promote a German renaissance that would touch upon all German 'volk'. Politically and economically, Germany was in a state of shambles because of the global economic depression. Many Germans feared an inevitable collapse to anarchy or Bolshevism. The opening scene starts with a Wagnerian piece and shows Hitler in a plane (he was the first head of state to use an airplane for political campaigns) peering down from high above the clouds as he arrives for the rally. The scenesought to reassure a worried public that The Fuhrer was omnipotent, omniscient, and was coming down from the heavens to save a troubled nation in a godlike fashion. When he arrives at the closing ceremony of the convention, Hitler is shown walking with his SS/SA escort out of the crowd and towards the podium instead from behind the podium to look down at the crowd; this was to instill the notion that Hitler wasn't just another Berlin bureaucrat from the old failed Weimar Republic coming to talk down to a broken people; it was done to evoke the sense that he was a man of the people for the peole: selflessly arising out of a worried crowd of fellow Germans to lead them to a better and safer future. Other scenes of happy German blonde and blue-eyed youths or common laborers performing paramilitary/social tasks were intended to evoke a proud sense of unity, purpose, and safety amongst all true German \\"volk\\" in these troubled times. Other scenes show speeches by Hitler and other NAZI functionaries telling party members how all Germans should unite for the Fatherland and not Godless Bolshevism; how youths should work to better their nation and learn endurance; etc., etc.       The film can be watched in the original format or with an added commentary by a contemporary historian. The narrative adds a lot of information as to the intent of the film as well as the development of fascism in Germany. This film is important not only as a historical tool to understand the rise of Nazism and the dynamics of fascism, it is a very important landmark in the development of film, mass entertainment and mass communication in general. The mass communication techniques of Riefenstahl and Goebbels are still used today by virtually every modern government and media firm. In entertainment, Reifenstahl's filming techniques in camera work, scene arrangements, and editing, have been used by some of the greatest film makers such as George Lucas (the ceremonial procession at the end of Episode IV in particular), Stephen Spielberg, Ridley Scott, and Stanley Kubrick to name a few. I strongly believe that every person who seeks to better understand their world, political institutions, and mass media see this film at least once and study it.

B00000JGHM|5.0|Director Michael Mann's 1995 film is certainly the best bank caper movie ever made. In addition to having great character studies of both the criminals (De Niro, Sizemore, Kilmer), it also studies those of the cops (Pacino.) Without a doubt, this movie has one of the best shootout scenes I have ever seen in any movie besides a war film.<br /><br />Impeccable acting on the part of De Niro, who's looking to do one last heist before quitting the game. Although Pacino also delivers a powerful performance as the cop, I found it to be more of the same hysterics as in virtually all of his other roles (i.e. Scarface, Scent of a Woman, etc.) Val Kilmer and Ashley Judd also delivered a great performance.<br /><br />A very entertaining film with the right balance of drama and action to keep you on the edge of your seats. Definitely the crown of all bank heist films.
B000002UAR|4.0|Sgt. Pepper is often considered the best album of all time (see my review), however while Revolver isn't the best either I do consider it to be better.      Taxman (9/10) This is a great way to open up an album, very clever lyrics from George and great guitar parts by Paul. A solid track for sure.      Eleanor Rigby (5/10) I've never really enjoyed this track too much, I've just found it to be too draining and boring to listen to.      I'm Only Sleeping (8/10)Another great one, it's very mellow, and captures the theme of feeling sleepy very well.      Love You To (7/10) I'm sort of baffled about the spelling of this track but I enjoy the indian music being incorporated into Beatles songs.      Here, There, and Everywhere (10/10) Pauls best song on the album by far, a beautiful love song, in my top 15 Beatles compositions.      Yellow Submarine (7/10) Sure it's repetitive and annoying, but who cares? Actually this song has become sort of an inside-joke between my friends and I.       She Said She Said (8/10) A great psychadelic pop song, with good lyrics and good guitar throughout.      Good Day Sunshine (4/10) The downfall of Revolver, WAY too pretentious and stupid. Sure it's happy, but it just doesn't do it for me.      And Your Bird Can Sing (9/10)An upbeat song that really picks up the album after &quot;Sunshine&quot; nonsensical lyrics and high upbeat vocals make this a cool song.      For No One (9/10) Another great ballad from Paul.I love the Horn part.      Doctor Robert (6/10)Not a terrible song, but i tend to skip it.      I Want To Tell You (7/10) A mediocre little song, with cute lyrics but not one of the albums best.      Got To Get You Into My Life (8/10) Great vocals from Paul, I like the cabare style backing music.      Tomorrow Never Knows (10/10) The great thing about this song is that it could've been made yesterday and nobody would think twice, but the fact that it was done in 1966 just shows you how large of an influence The Beatles had on popular music.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Anthony Minghella's tragedy of the weary soldier who only longs to be with his promised love. The theme is a variation on Homer's Odyssey where, after years of surviving the depravities of war, the hero-soldier undertakes a perilous journey home; reuniting with his loved one only after many trials and tribulations. Although the theme isn't new, the script properly grasps the attitudes and mannerisms of the time. The cinematography and editing is top knotch.    Nicole Kidman plays Ada, a preacher's daughter who, in 1860, moves with her father to the rustic bliss of Cold Mountain, North Carolina. Ada falls in love with Inman (Jude Law) but, before their love can be consummated, Inman answers to the call of duty and joins the Confederate Army. Before he leaves, Ada promises to wait for his return and to marry him. By 1864, Inman is a broken man: shocked by the brutal realities of war and seeing no purpose to the carnage. He sees the Confederacy as doomed and, longing for Ada, resigns himself to deserting the army. He begins his long perilous journey from the frontlines to his home. In the meantime, things go from bad to worse in Cold Mountain and Ada is forced to hold the house on her own. Exploiting her fears that Inman may be dead, prospective suitors unwelcomingly court Ada. In the meantime, Ada welcomes a runaway girl named Ruby (Renee Zellweger)to help her with the farm's chores. The climax of the film rises as Inman comes closer to home. Sadly for both Ada and Inman, their reunion is bittersweet.    The acting is great although I think Nicole Kidman was too well groomed for her role. Even if immaculate and beautiful, women of the 1860s didn't look as if they just came out of a Hollywood beauty salon: especially those who lived and worked in a rural setting.  I also found the final erotic scene to be at odds with her character and the theme the story tried to convey. Ada is supposed to be a virgin patiently waiting for her man: Ingham is the only man she ever knew.  Despite this plot and theme, the film presents her in a passionate love making scene that doesn't fool anyone. Only someone who passed their time dilligently reading the Karma Sutra or flattening straw with a farm hand back in the barn would have the sexual maturity the innocent Ada seemingly possesses in the film.  Finally, please spare us from such visuals in the first place: does every film involving a love story have to have an overdone and gratuitous sex scene?  This is supposed to be an old-fashioned Gone With the Wind-style romantic tragedy and not an erotic drama!    Again, the story is a thematic variation from the Odyssey. The warrior-hero leaves to face the horrors of war and returns only after a long life-changing journey. A great romantic tragedy that appeals to both men and women. I strongly recommend it.

I think you'll agree if you've ever seen a minute! I was sad when this show went off the air in 1999, and I wish it could have went on forever.Well, when its released on DVD, (hopefully soon!!) it can. To me it'll hold up for 1000 years, and will never lose its effect. I'm looking forward to, like many other Seinfeld fanatics like myself, to watching Krammer drop in, Festivous for the rest of us, and the multitude of every other second this show has to offer. I just wish Jerry would hurry!!
B00005JKLZ|1.0|A new adaptation of H.G. Well's classic tale with a twist; Enamoured savant seeks to meet with lost love but then gets really lost.    The acting is unimpressive and the base of the story too generic to be called creative. The actors playing the natives render a monotone reading of the script with placid faces bringing a real yawn from those who are watching. The motivation of the main character is a pretty dull formula; trying to change the past. As one reviewer said, wouldn't the curiosity of knowing what the future holds be motivation enough? In terms of the science fiction in the story, the notion that there would be anything left of the 19th or even 21st century after almost 1 million years is equally absurd: suddenly the character is able to find the exact location of his home even after the state of New York has transformed into the new Grand Canyon? Please. It seems that the script writers were so concerned about having a politically correct script that they lost their imagination all together. The special effects are great but that's about it.    The 1960 George Pal version is better in story and the effects are still worthy of note. This is a good movie for girls in their early teens . Worth renting and watching at least once; I wouldn't waste my money buying it.
6304696515|4.0|Stephen Frears adaptation of Les Liaisons Dangereuse draws the audience into the amorous intrigues of 18th century France. Although Glenn Close as Marquise De Merteuil and John Malkovich the Vicomte De Valmont deliver impeccable performances as the principal characters, the whole setting is ruined by the simply atrocious performances by Keeanu Reeves and Michelle Pfeiffer.      Reeves and Pfeiffer actually have a lot in common in that their mediocre acting skills undermine the historical setting of the film. As is typical with most method actors, Reeves and Pfeiffer are best at playing their own bland personalities without much creativity: this type of training rarely works in period films as the actor tries to incorporate the character's moods and actions into their own personality as opposed to the other way around. The typical result is that the actor fails to follow the proper idioms, mannerisms, and language of such characters. In short, neither Pfeiffer or Reeves have the tact or skill to play a historical character (This is perfectly demonstrated in Reeve's horrible performance in Coppolla's Dracula.) Typically, successful period films tend to be those that have mostly theatrical actors performing the key roles (i.e. Richard Burton, Alec Guinness, Anthony Hopkins, John Lithgow, James Earl Jones, etc.)      Although I did somewhat enjoy this rendition, I preferred Milos Foreman's &quot;Valmont&quot; with Collin Firth and Annette Benning. The film was more faithful to the cultural sensibilities of 18th century France than Dangerous Liaisons.
0800177177|3.0|Francis Coppola's 1992 \\"Dracula\\" has varying qualities of acting and special effects that leave the audience feeling somewhat empty at the end. The film often seems rushed and cliche without any depth. <br />  <br /> Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins are the anchors to the movie and keep it from falling into a trash-film category. Winona Ryder as Mina Murray plays her role reasonably well as the object of the Count's desires. Tom Waits also steals the show as the Count's deformed servant, Renfield. Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker kills the movie in every way: the man simply can't act as anyone but himself. <br />  <br /> I am a big fan of both Hopkins and Oldman but this movie is simply too mediocre for me to buy. The special effects are extremely takcy with all the trappings of stage props: I've seen better gimmicks at a play. Worth renting once but hardly worth buying. <br />  <br />
0345350499|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this version of the King Arthur lengend. It deals primarily with with the women behind King Arthur's court. The characters are complex and you really start caring for the characters and it's so easy to start sharing the emotions that they have throughout the novel.  It's a wonderul twist to an old tale.  I've read this book at least 4 times already and each time, I seem to love it more and more!
B0000640VO|5.0|There isn't anything that I didn't love about this movie. I've seen it twice so far, and plan to watch it many many more times. It is funny, heart lifting, and beautiful. Anytime your life needs a lift, watch Amelie!
B00008EY65|5.0|The movie is superb, is the best adaptation from comic book to silver screen, for those who are hellboy readers they can appreciate that the dialogues, the rhythm and most of all the essence of mignola style is on the screen, Hellboy is a success, the most loyal and precise translation from a comic book ever and is also amazing how DEL TORO managed to tell a long story in so little time, and for the ones that like some more the directors cut is coming in november.<br /><br />The quality of the image is great, the audio is awesome and the dvd is loaded with a lots of extras, is perhaps the most complete making of in the dvd history only matched by the criterion collection and Lord of the rings extended editions dvds. I'm waiting impatiently for the directors cut dvd and the second movie.
0783226063|3.0|Adaptation of ANY science fiction is difficult, but taking a work like Frank Herberts &quot;Dune&quot; requires large directorial cohonas. This was Heavily panned by the critics, but is actually a great movie to own rather than rent, for 2 main reasons.<br /><br /> 1)It's a classic of the genre<br /><br /> 2)You'll need to watch it at least twice to figure out what's going on<br /><br /> This is the theatrical version, and there are two other versions in circulation, a Japanese laser disc version some 50 mins longer, and a fully uncut version (accredited to Alan Smithee as director after Lynch withdrew his name in protest) some 7 minutes longer than that. Running time here is about right, and although puritans will say the full version is better, it actually makes the movie even more protracted and bizarre that it already is.<br /><br /> The plot is actually mildly simple - 2 opposing warring families from different planets come together to try and gain control of the planet Arrakis (also known as Dune)the sole depository in the universe of the all powerful (and essential to space travel) spice melange. One of them is being surrepticiously backed by the Emperor in an attempt to have the spice for himself, and the other just may have a legendary saviour in the form of Kyle McClachlan, able to deliver the desolete planet from the bonds of tyranny, and liberate it's indigenous population (know as the Fremmen). Unfortunately, even if you're familiar with Frank Herberts work, the directing style of David Lynch (who is weird most of the time anyway) makes the movie even more confusing, and leaves way too many questions unanswered for the uninitiated viewer. I loved the movie, even though it nosedived at the box office, but there is an eerie mysticism to the whole production. The visuals that were pretty great for the year of production are lavish, and the musical score is also well placed. The cast list is pretty impressive too, both upfront and in cameo, and all members play out with a fine tuned sense of immersion into the story. The bottom line however remains the same, MOST people watching this for the first time will probably be saying EH? and if you can endure it, several viewings are needed to make sense of it all. Classic but confusing - Enjoyout with a fine tuned sense of immersion into the story.

B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage Agaisnt the Machine is one of the best bands of the 90's. they are one of my favorites along with Kyuss, Soundgarden, and Led Zeppelin. It is so good to take such a breath of fresh air, and stray away from the bile that MTV feeds us on a dialy basis. The &quot;Rock&quot; they play on that station has no heart or soul, not to metion doesnt sound good. RATM is music with a profound political message. Im 15 but im old enough to know that pop-punk bands of our time suck, and kids my age should be listening to Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Kyuss, if they want to know what rock and roll is all about. But back to the album itself. My Favorite track has to be Calm like a Bomb. the beginning to this song sends chills down my spine. Then the song explodes with bass and De La Rochas vocals. Testify, Born of a Broken Man, and Sleep Now in the Fire are also some of my favorites. It is truly a shame that RATM broke up so soon and that while udioslave may be good, they will never live up to Ratm or Soundgarden for that matter. Bottom line this album rocks and is a must have, and sure is worth the price.
B00005OADE|5.0|Firefly is the first album of the short lived (unforunately) John Lawton era. This album is right up there with their classics of the early 70's. John Lawton is just below David Bryon as far as vocal talent and much better than any of his successors. He's more blusier than Byron,but doesn't have the range.  <br />  <br /> If you are looking for the heavy side of the band, this album is not it. The material on this album is closer to the laid back tracks that dominate &quot;The Magician Birthday&quot;.  <br />  <br /> Breakdown review of the tracks.  <br />  <br /> 1. The Hanging Tree - UH returns to the fantasy theme on their earlier albums with this one. Nice guitar echo effects at the songs introduction.  <br />  <br /> 2. Been Gone Too Long - Start out slow and then speeds up, though not too loud. Fits Lawton perfectly.  <br />  <br /> 3. Who Needs Me. - A Southern rock boogie style song. Songwritter Ken Hensley would leave Heep for Southern rockers a few year later. His interest in Southern fried rock seems to show early here.  <br />  <br /> 4. Wise Man - The Wizard, part II. Nice piano ballad that continues the theme of the Wizard on Demon and Wizards.  <br />  <br /> 5. Do You Know - The weakest track on the album. A throw away.  <br />  <br /> 6. Rollin On - Could easily be mistaken for a Paul Rogers' Bad Company ballad. Good song though.  <br />  <br /> 7. Sympathy - Nice mid temple rocker.  <br />  <br /> 8. Firefly - One of the best epic UH has ever done. Song by organist/guitarist Ken Hensley. Nice soft keyboards and accoustic guitars. Has a Crosby, Still, & Nash feel to it.  <br />  <br /> 9. Crimes of Passion - Another song with a Bad Company feel to it.  <br />  <br /> 10 A Far Better Way - This is a bonus track that should have made it on the original album. A soft ballad that sounds like it's was song by Ken Hensley (Doesn't sound like Lawton's gritty voice). Could have been an Elton John song.  <br />
0316666343|4.0|I feel that it started very strongly, deeply with frightening detail, ran a bit long through the middle and ended predictably with every outstanding storyline coming to a perfect close.  However, that said I adore this book.  I did not want Susie to die, and in fact, felt a sense of losing her at the closing of this book.  No one can ever fully realize the emotions felt by parents and siblings and loved ones when losing someone in such a violent way, but I feel that Alice Sebold gave us a bit of insight into the many facets of grief and all the different ways in which it can (or cannot) be dealt with.  I very much recommend this book.

0312319517|4.0|I like this author a lot. This story seemed awkward with long passages of words to action. Still, this author tells a really good story and even though this seemed to bounce around a lot, I couldn't stop reading. I cared about the characters so much and even cried for Amanda Jane.
B0000844I8|2.0|This film directed Roland Emmerich and written/produced by Dean Devlin deals with the discovery of an ancient Egyptian portal to extra-terrestrial worlds. A young Egyptologist (James Spader)is able to translate the portal's hieroglyphs and activate it. He then joins a reconnaissance force led by Kurt Russell to a desert planet that eerily resembles ancient Egypt. The team soon brings on the wrath of an extraterrestrial who was/is worshipped as the sun god Ra (Jaye Davidson) and who threatens the fate of humanity on the other side of the portal.      The story is imaginative but shoots itself in the foot. The aliens in the movie seem far less of a threat than those in the T.V. show. At one point, Ra foils the team's detonation of a tactical nuclear device and, in an ominous voice, threatens the world's leaders by saying \\"We have weapons a hundred times more powerful!\\" The absurdity of the threat being that such weapons would be but a mere fraction of the total nuclear arsenal possessed by the U.S. alone! I couldn't help but laugh and, realistically, the humans receiving the message would have laughed too or breathed a sigh of relief at the very least. The audience also never really gets a glimpse of this seemingly omnipotent being's powers other than a small number of Anubis look-alike guards carrying laser staffs and clumsily piloting seemingly unimpressive flying saucers. Where are his legions of doom? Where is the threat that seems to instill so much fear among the characters and brings the climax to the story? The audience sure doesn't see it!      I like the t.v. series much better than this pretentious sci-fi production. The acting was decent and the special effects o.k. Unfortunately the writers should have thought their story through before releasing it to the theaters. Nice to rent once but it's not worth owning: save your money and buy the T.V. series instead.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Aside from laughing my ass off, taking in the gorgeous cinematography, and pretty much reminding myself to blink, I had another thought while watching this famous buddy movie/western: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid may just be the shortest 110-minute movie I've ever seen. It's quite amazing how fast the film moves along, really. Not a ton happens, compared to some vast, epic westerns, and yet the final scene (about which you probably already know even if you haven't seen it) comes along like it's only been running for 15 minutes. Among other things, that proves that not only is Sundance a great film, but maybe one of the greatest. Paul Newman and Robert Redford define cool (and are quite funny; my favorite scene: an attempted bank robbery in Bolivia that ends with both outlaws backing out of the bank in embarrassment), Katherine Ross is a perfect choice for the starstruck schoolteacher that accompanies them, and - as I mentioned before - you'll just be bowled over by Conrad Hall's cinematography. You don't have to like westerns to love this movie; I don't, and I'm practically giddy to buy it and watch it again. GRADE: A+ <br />
0780628551|1.0|This movie attempts base its science fiction plot almost entirely on dialogue. That would be fine and dandy if: (1) there were a story to tell; and (2) if the dialogue were even half interesting. <br /> <br />The plot itself is incomplete; a rough draft at best. Jonny Depp's and Charlize Theron's acting are minimal in this film; the lines are straight from the script with no emotion or realism. This film is not even worth one star and certainly not worth renting. Unless you need a sleeping aid, save your time and your money. <br /> <br /> <br />

B0000B1OFL|3.0|F. Gary Gray's remake of the 1969 original starring Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, and Donald Sutherland. A modern rendition for Generation \\"X\\" with lot of action and good comedy. The razzles and dazzles of this movie unfortunately require a lot of imagination by the audience for it to be credible.      I find hard to believe that any Mini-Cooper, no matter how good its suspension or engine modifications, could haul around a half-ton or more of gold while flying around L.A.'s flood drains. Even with oxygen, I think people would be quite dead of hypothermia sitting at the bottom of a frigid lake in the Swiss Alps after only a few minutes.  Finally, a fiber-glass hull speed boat receiving a one-ton safe crashing through several stories isn't going to be speeding anywhere into Venice's canals except to a watery grave.      The acting was enjoyable and the action sequences entertaining but, again, the adventure of the characters is a little too far fetched to be credible.
B000001F3C|3.0|I've been playing U2's 1983 album &quot;War&quot; for the past few days now, given it numerous spins, but I'm a little dissopointed. With only ten tracks, I was expecting them to rip through it. Having been told it was such a political album and a must have for any U2 fan, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. <br />  <br /> Sure, it's a really good listen. The first four or five tracks are amazing, the standouts being &quot;New Year's Day&quot; and &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;. I can't get enough of the latter, it's got such deep verses, great instruments and such an addictive chorus. With such an amazing opening to the album with these few tracks, I was sure it was going to be a classic. However, the second half of the album is weak. It's listenable and I do like it, I just tend to loose focus and interest at about track seven. <br />  <br /> If you're a U2 fan of any description, I really do reccommend it. If not, you can pass on this. I was really let down. 3 stars.
6305127646|3.0|Very loose adapation of Leslie Charteris's original character, the Saint(Simon Templar)who was wonderfully played by Roger Moore in the 1960's T.V. series. Although Val Kilmer plays his own version of the character with a lot of impersonations, the movie overall falls flat with a ridiciulous romantic sub-plot involving a cute scientist (Elisabeth Shue.) As if the movie script was written by a pubescent girl dreaming what it would be like to live in such a fantasy world of espionage. The plot was just too absurd and far-fetched to be credible and was too immersed into an idiotic romance which should have never been.     The characters were 2-dimensional cliches that are typical hollywood junk cranked out on the screen year after year.  The Saint was a suave debonaire who helped women in distress but was far too mature of a man reduce himself to the idiotic da-da, all over you, puppy-love romance shown in the film. Such a scenario is one that only immature little girls fantasize about before coming of age. It therefore immediately apparent that the script was written for a teen female audience that would drool over Kilmer and dish out their dollars to indulge in their naive erotic fantasies.    Although I am a very big fan of Val Kilmer's work and own many of his movies, I haven't bothered even renting this piece of trash. I'd rather spend my money and buy the original Roger Moore mini-series instead.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Audioslave is one of the few active bands I enjoy listening to nowadays. Good rock is hard to find these days - you can be sure that you're not going to find it on MTV or at the top of the charts. So it makes sense that these guys can really rock, as they've all been doing it for over a decade. The pairing of Chris Cornell with a Zack de la Rocha-less Rage Against the Machine doesn't seem like it would work - and for those of you expecting classic Soundgarden or Rage will likely be disappointed - but on its own merits, Audioslave rocks. Their 2002 self-titled debut features both Chris Cornell's distinctive, hollering vocals and the crazy but ingenious guitar of Tom Morello. The album opens with the thundering lead single Cochise, followed by the head-banging rockers Show Me How to Live, Gasoline, and What You Are. Like a Stone is the CD's best track - an emotional, passionate song featuring some truly beautiful guitar work from Morello. Set It Off is another energetic rocker, and Shadow of the Sun is a great track with heartfelt vocals and awesome guitar. After the uplifting semi-ballad I Am The Highway, the CD getts bogged down somewhat. Exploder and Bring Em Back Alive are tolerable enough, but Hypnotize is lame, Light My Way is nothing special, and Getaway Car, while pretty good, isn't the kind of song I would expect from three former members of Rage Against the Machine. The album's closer, The Last Remaining Light, is a somehwat eerie, pshycadelic track, and while not horrible, isn't the ideal way to wrap up the group's 1st album. <br /> <br />So Audioslave's much-hyped debut, while not pefect, does feature a good-sized helping of memorable rock. Hopefully, the band will continue to make kick-ass rockers like Show Me How to Live and Gasoline, as well as more emotional tracks like I Am The Highway and Like A Stone, for their upcoming second album. This group has a lot of potential, and I hope they can continue to be a guiding light in this age of crappy mainstream MTV-rock.
B00005K3NY|2.0|David Croneberg's 1980 film about telepathic humans being recruited by government and an evil corporate defense contractor. The good telepath Cameron ( Stephen Lack) comes upon the conspiracy and seeks to do the right thing. An evil telepath named Revok ( Michael Ironside) seeks to carry out his evil plan and stop Cameron. <br />  <br /> Horrible film quality that has every trapping of a &quot;B&quot; movie. Terribly outdated and overrated. The script is dull, the story is predictable, the acting utterly mediocre, and the special effects are cheap. It's time for this movie to find its Hollywood grave. <br />  <br />
0441009425|2.0|I've read much more than my share of SF over the years, from short-shorts to multi-book sets, and this book was definitely one of the biggest disappointments. <br /> <br />Reynolds is a gifted writer, no argument there.  But he's also far too in love with the cheap technique of conspicuously keeping secrets from the reader; there are too many places where one character tells another A Big Secret, and the author has to skip or gloss over the conversation to keep it from the reader.  It's cheesy and more than a little annoying. <br /> <br />I also thought there were too many places where his prose needed much more attention from an editor, particularly in those areas where Reynolds lapsed into techno-purple prose. <br /> <br />I was really looking forward to this book and the sequels, but I'll skip the rest.

The film shines in all areas: cinematography, direction, acting, and costumes.        The film is based on the rumors that the court's royal composer, Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), brought Mozart (Tom Hulce)to an untimely death out of jealousy and spite. Although the rumors have little weight in history, they form a great foundation for a drama such as this film. Tom Hulce plays the childish Mozart to perfection with his spurts of laughter and giggles. Abraham received an Oscar for his role as the brooding Salieri. Supporting this great film is the beautiful music of Mozart performed by The Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-fields: Sir Neville Marinner conducting: one of the finest symphonic groups for Mozart's music.        Don't miss this breathtaking film. The drama and humor in the film are, like the music, suited for all ages. A great film for the entire family.
B0001M0A4I|4.0|I know all you Genesis fans ,like myself really look for rare stuff <br /> or new stuff ,from the past Genesis bands. Well ,this is  <br /> something very special,by Tony Banks. Its all together different, <br /> I was expecting those &quot;genesis&quot; chording. But it is wonderful to listen to. If you go on Tony Bank's site,it tells of the hardship <br /> of &quot;converting&quot; his ideas to the London Philharmonic. A great <br /> CD to get,just listen to the different sounds of Banks.
B00005221L|4.0|One of Arnold's best films outside of Conan and Terminator. Also a great action star line-up with Jesse Ventura and Carl Weathers. <br />  <br /> The characters seem like GI-Joe action figure stereotypes but the script and action sequences make them believable and entertaining. Even with the mystery of the predator being gone, I still get thrills every time I see this movie: not to mention laughs at the humorous dialogue; &quot;I'm gonna have me some fun! I'm gonna have me some fun!&quot; <br />  <br /> The special effects are still great after all of this time and the music really carries on the suspense. Altogether one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made! I've watched this movie a hundred times and I stil enjoy it. <br />  <br />
B00005B36H|5.0|I know some hate Tool... <br /> <br />But I don't think Tool's intent was to make themselves a metal band....it's jus the notion everyone has about them.  If I remember they always thought of themselves as a form of art.  True the music may not be really upbeat, and they definitely don't have a billion solos lol, but that's not the point..  <br /> <br />you have to listen to this music, open up and let it take you somewhere, it DOES take a few listens though..cuz most albums this long do jus ramble on and on and on...but you can't expect this to be your master of puppets, justice for all, or any metal album seriously.. <br /> <br />so if you like metal..fine, but Tool is not thatttt bad and this album in it's on right deserves recognition. It's rare that an album this inaccessible becomes a commercial success
B00004RFFI|1.0|An utterly pathetic movie with about 5 minutes of by now out-of-date CGI effects and another hour and thirty minutes of fluff. Watch a documentary on tornadoes: I assure you, it's a lot more interesting than this garbage film.      Other than some brief moments of special effects, this movie has absolutely no creativity or imagination whatsoever. The script and story line formulas are so generic that they were probably taken out of a textbook. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play two white trash tornado chasers engaged in a shouting contest of stupid one-liners such as \\"Now!\\", \\"Let's go!\\", \\"Move!\\", \\"Yeah!\\" to the point you'd actually think you're with a drunken crowd at a football game.      As for the suspension of disbelief in this film, the other reviews have already described it ad nauseam. Save your money and don't pay Hollywood to see such garbage: they may eventually produce more good movies worth watching.
B00000G3I2|5.0|If you were in high school and/or college in the early 70's, this movie will really hit home. One of my all time favorites.
0790740443|1.0|This has to be one of the worst sci-fi movies of all time and definitely the worst movie Kurt Russel has ever done. A total waste of time. <br />  <br /> The genetically-bred/robot soldier story has become so cliche and overdone that it would now take a lot more imagination for such a film to be good than what this trash has to offer. Kurt Russel doesn't really act in this movie as he has an even smaller script than Schwarzenneger had in &quot;Terminator.&quot; In terms of quality, &quot;Escape From New York&quot; would really be Oscar material in light of this garbage. <br />  <br /> The story is utterly predictable and the action is weak. Terrible film. Don't believe the great reviews for this movie and save yourselves both money and time. <br />  <br />
0930073193|5.0|This is a great introduction to economics that ranks up there with Hayek's &quot;Road to Serfdom&quot;.
B00005JKN9|2.0|Tale of survival and vengeance in the ethnically divided burroughs of 1860s New York where Leonardo DiCaprio seeks to avenge his father's killer and gang chief played by Daniel Day-Lewis. <br /> <br />Certainly Scorcese brings out the smell of the tensions of the time, however, the acting and backdrops fail to bring any flavor to the story. The latter are too melodramatic and two-dimensional to bring the movie out of its Hollywood stereotype formula. Daniel Day Lewis plays his role well but the script and character is more archetypical than anything else; the characters psyche and motives aren't well explored. With so much of the film focusing on gangs and strife, one wonders why Cameron Diaz' character is included the story. The movie also has serious historical flaws as to events and the prevailing attitudes of the day. <br /> <br />In the end, you feel as if you just watched an average blood-fest movie and not much else. <br /> <br /> <br />
0671027387|5.0|Dan Brown has proven to be one of the most exciting and vivid writers of this new century.  Ignore the little nitpicking on this board about &quot;Canadian National Radio&quot; (Which by the way is a very common name for the CBC's radio component try googling it) and other tiny nonconsequential factors.  Pick up this book.  Read it and you will be absorbed into his writing like so many others have become!
B00006JDVV|1.0|Rob Bowman film mixing medieval fantasy with modern apocalyptic theme starring Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey as modern dragon killers. <br />  <br /> The spawn of devastating dragons are accidentally released through a mining accident and overwhelm the Earth but you don't get to see that. What you get is a big leap in time after which isolated pockets of humans (Yanks and Brits) reduced to mere subsistence remain to defeat the flying fire-breathing reptiles. The unfortunate thing is that there isn't much to see in the movie at that point: as if the best parts of the movie had also been burned by those elusive dragons. The only thing left to burn is the audience really. <br />  <br /> The story is actually unimaginative and more of an assortment of cliches to create a mood which never really stands out. Why would modern humans return to dwelling in castles and medieval customs? Just because their enemy are dragons and both are a product common to medieval lore? Why not live in abandoned subways or underground hideouts such as in the &quot;Terminator&quot;? <br />  <br /> The dialogue is also stereotypical and the characters shallow. Freedom loving Yankees competing against their snobish Brit counterparts. The worst part is the story having been so dissected that you don't even know what's going on anymore. After being frustrated with the bad sound mixing and acting, you probably won't even care about understanding the story. <br />  <br /> I wouldn't recommend even renting this movie because there isn't much to watch in it except special features on bad film making. Save your money. <br />  <br />  <br />
B0000C1733|1.0|Red hot chili peppers suck...why waste my time telling you people why. You all know its true
0783225903|5.0|The movie is Monty Python star Terry Gilliam's finest work. An adaptation of Orwell's classic political satire \\"1984\\" starring Jonathan Pryce and Robert De Niro.      The movie follows the same dominant theme and plot structure of 1984 but adds a little more light humor to the story. Just as in \\"1984\\", society is controlled by a totalitarian state and all modes of subversion are suppressed. The movie is perhaps less focused on the communist overtones in Orwell's novel and shows more of a fascistic state. The images are surreal and follow the main character's desire to escape and/or revolt against social conformity and bureaucratic convention.      I liked this movie a lot more than the the movie \\"1984\\" starring Richard Burton. The theme here is a little more jovial and comical but still sends the same message as its gloomier counterpart.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is by far one of the best medevil dramas I have ever seen.  The story sweeps you away to a time of honor and courage.  Mel was perfect for the role of William Wallace.  Personally I think he should've taken home the Oscar for his fine acting abillities, but Nick Cage was a great choice for the award.  The epic battle sequences were amazing and the set direction and look the movie had was wonderful. Five Stars
B00005V9IL|3.0|Can't see the big deal about this movie. Although the story and special effects are somewhat creative, the acting and film is just plain boring and dull.    A lot of shouting matches and action yelling without much significant dialogue. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's spousal spasms were just plain irritating. The best acting was by Michael Biehn who played the paranoid Navy SEAL. The movie takes too long to get to the point and there isn't much going on in between those long plot lags except those annoying shouting matches between Ed and Mary: one can watch Jerry Springer free for that.    A nice try by Cameron but certainly not one of his best works. Worth renting if you have nothing else to watch and you have a lot of time on your hands.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I had zero doubts that this film would be great.  Everything about this film added more excitement and drama to the saga.  Being the middle of the film it was unstructured, but still packed a box office punch.  Once again the acting, special effects, and story were wonderful.  A great follow up, and a perfect set up for a final installment.
0783231202|2.0|Another Spilbergian piece of Hollywood propaganda about how slavery was bad and it was all the fault of Europeans. Funny that Spielberg chooses to omit the African character's lucrative enterprise in the slave trade when he returns to his homeland. Maybe he should make more movies about the countless Africans who enslaved other Africans to explain how they eventually came to America: after all as Caine said, &quot;Am I not my brother's keeper?&quot; <br />  <br /> The movie is filled with false historical characters and gives the impression that the civil rights movement well underway as early as in the 1840s: baloney! Even in the 1860s, abolitionism was nothing but propaganda to lure ignorant zealots as canon fodder to the front lines of the Civil War; the cause of the conflict being a lot more disturbing: carpetbagging industrialists looking for low paying factory slaves to the north and snug plantation dixiecrats wanting to keep their slaves south of the Mason-Dixie line. Perhaps Spielberg should make a movie explaining how the KKK was formed in Connecticut and not the South as most people think. <br />  <br /> The film is too revisionist and soft-hearted for my taste. If a point is to be made by such films, then it should give weight to all of the issues involved. Maybe someone will have the guts to do a movie about these truths but,until then, I'll have to continue turning my head in disgust at this Hollywood drivel. <br />  <br />  <br />
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Master and Commander is a slow, but good epic telling the story of Captain Jack Aubrey, a valiant sailor played by Russel Crowe.  The story is set amidst the open ocean, in which Aubrey is frequently attacked by the French army.  The story tends to be slow at times and the characters lack development even with the films length.  What holds the movie together is its realism and accuracy to history and the period.  Russel Crowe gives a performance worthy of Oscar nods but doesn't outshine his roles in Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind.  This film is a must see of 2003 and a great film for fans of films like Treasure Island and Mutiny on the Bounty.
B00003RQNJ|3.0|The film written by William Goldman and directed by George Roy Hill has a solid cast with Paul Newman playing Butch Cassidy and Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid. Unfortunately, some of the scenes and soundtrack take away from the fading West of the early 1900s and bring us back to the takcy tastes of the 1970s. <br />  <br /> Both Redford and Newman play solid roles as good old western outlaws who are facing the rapid shrinking of the West with the advance of industry. Incessantly fleeing their pursuers, they decide to make their ill-gotten gains in the less-developed regions of the world: Bolivia. <br />  <br /> A soundtrack is more often than not just as important as the film itself; &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; is a perfect example. It sets the mood of the film and helps guide the story. The la-la music of &quot;Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head&quot; with happy scenes of bicycle rides really kills what would be a western as classic as Peckinpah's &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;; making it sound more like a Cumbaya flower-child festival than a bank-robbing western. How would people feel if Clint Eastwood had chosen Neil Diamond or the Bee-Gees for &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;? In short, such music selection indicates lack of foresight by those who directed and produced this film. Perhaps it's time for a new rendition of this story with more inspired film-makers who know good music when they hear it. <br />  <br />
B00005JN2F|4.0|The Bourne Supremacy is a new kind of action thriller, which out classes 007 by a landslide.  Set in the cold streets of Berlin we follow Jason Bourne once again on his quest for revenge.  The story is very compelling, and the film is shot in a way that puts you in the center of all the action that is before you.  Matt Damon is definately outshining his Boston pal Ben Affleck in becoming the next big action star.  Unlike James Bond, you can relate to Jason Bourne because he lacks suave and perfection that Bond does.  He still can fight and talk his way through hostile situations but he does it more human than other action heroes we have seen in the past. Julia Stiles performs in an extremely short role in the film. The supporting cast is another great aspect in this film that is rare in other action films I have seen.  The action, acting, and everything else is brilliant in this explosive film.  Definately one of 2004's best.
B00008EY65|1.0|The answer? A good movie. I read the other reviews. And people liked it. This boggles my mind so much i might shoot myself but not until i summon a red creature through an ancient portal with killer nazis.<br />A giant red hand? why? was it swollen? or was his other hand just really small?<br />A gay fish? Abe sapien. As opposed to homo sapien. Which would fit him much better.<br />I've seen better crap floating in the toilet. If your really dumb with a severe handicap or a spawn of satan with no horns than you might like this movie. A giant hand? A giant red hand? (...)
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Cold Mountain is one of my favorite films of all time.  I saw this film five times at the movie theater and was utterly swepped away by its beautiful setting, acting, and story.  The movie is set in the deep south during the days of the civil war.  It centers around two characters.  Innman, a troubled soldier who leaves the war for home to Ada, a grieving woman who after the loss of her father (Donald Sutherland) is alone to fight for her life.  Soon Ada is aided by a drifter, Ruby (Renee Zellwegger) who teaches Ada the grueling tasks on obtaining a farm.  This film teaches valuable lessons about honor and courage unlike any film.  The chemistry between Kidman and Law is beautiful and passionate.  The best film of 2003. See It.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|The third matrix. Genious. These guys are so brilliant they dont have to make good movies or even sense. The train man. The maorlvigian. Brillaint. It was so good i went home and took all the red pills i could find in my house. I went on crazy, puked on my mom then tumbled down a well and went on a journey where i thought i knew kung fu and thought i was making a good movie. Sadly both were wrong.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|i liked this one way better than her first cd b/c it was more rock and it sounded like more of what Avril has always wanted to sound like. Her first was more popish and Avril isnt pop like britany pop but more like rock. SO i think her new album was more of her real sound than her first. It's what i hoped it would sound like. This is a must-get album.
B00004RYZT|5.0|Ok here I go. This is one of the greatest concerts that I have ever seen. And believe me I have seen some good ones this is one of the best. Till is out there doing his thing and by god it is amazing. If you have never heard Rammastein before they are techno metal. So put the techno metal thing toghter with at least 20,0000 fans or more and pyro and you have the concert. Just amazing
0440236738|5.0|Harlen Coben does a superb job in creating suspense in his cleverly written &quot;Gone for Good&quot;. Coben masterfully disguises the numerous plot twists that occur as this passionate drama climaxes. His novel proprels forward at rapid pace as his intriguing storyline unfolds<br /><br /> Will Klein, director of Covenant House, a haven for runaways and street urchins seduced by drugs and prostitution, is sitting vigil for his beloved mother who is dying of cancer. Days before her demise, she reveals to Will that his older brother Ken is alive. Ken, thought to be dead, had fled their affluent Livingston, New Jersey neighborhood eleven years ago. He was implicated in the rape and murder of Will's old girlfriend Julie Miller. Will was never convinced that his brother actually perpetrated this horrendous crime.<br /><br /> Will's girlfriend Sheila Rogers comforted him as they returned to the apartment they shared. Sheila who was very much in love with Will, was a very strange soul. She revealed none of her past and when she mysteriously departed without a trace while Will slept, he was utterly befuddled.<br /><br /> Fearing the worst, Will enlists the help of his best friend Squares. Squares, a former runaway himself is now a rich and celebrated yoga master. He serves as a volunteer at Covenant House combing the streets in a van, trying to help young and unfortunate street people survive. Using Squares' many contacts, they search for clues to discover Sheila's whereabouts and the status of Ken. Their investigation gets them in contact with people that populated Will's past in Livingston, some of them quite dangerous and unsavory.
0767821629|4.0|THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR....most buildings don't have them due to our superstitions about the unlucky number.  This movie's 13th floor adds some validity to this concern, but in a way one wouldn't imagine.<br /><br />Opening with a stunning recreation of 1937 Los Angeles, the film moves into its labrynthine plot.  Since that plot has been so carefully relayed by other reviewers, I won't bore the reader with my summation.<br /><br />Suffice to say, it is an unusual film (I haven't seen MATRIX)that takes the viewer into a simulated world that is both intriguing and frightening.<br /><br />Craig Bierko as Douglas gives a nicely understated performance in three very different roles.  I've never seen Mr. Bierko before, but he should have a bright future..he's kind of like a Mel Gibson prototype in his laconic delivery.<br /><br />Vincent D'Onofrio, a brilliant actor, gets to ham it up in two very different roles, one a villain, one a computer nerd.<br /><br />Gretchen Mol looks like she stepped out of a 40s movie, and projects the right amount of mystery and sensuality.<br /><br />Dennis Haysbert as the cop reminds me of Denzel Washington at times, but gives a solid performance.<br /><br />Armin Mueller-Stahl as the pictures' focal character does a good job as well.<br /><br />The direction is tight and the effects are dazzling, but the recreation of the 30s is beautifully shot and lit.<br /><br />A nice surprise for reality vs. illusion fans.
B000002JEV|5.0|It's been a while since I've heard this album, and when I first reviewed it I gave it four stars plus change.    I'm going to have to disagree with me, though. It's better than that. All in all, this is probably the finest live Zep I have ever heard...no cheating on the high notes from Plant, tight, focused playing from Page, and a rock solid, yet supple foundation laid down by Jones and Bonham. And the sound is excellent as well, crisp and clear.    The material on disc one was originally recorded in 1969, if I remember correctly, so those are the \\"oldies\\". Two renditions of \\"You Shook Me\\", one five, one ten minutes, and Jimmy Page doing his best Muddy Waters on the slide guitar. \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" is even more powerful than the studio recording, and the same thing goes for the thundering riff-fest \\"Communication Breakdown\\".  And the non-album tracks are equally wonderful. Led Zeppelin have fun with Eddie Cochran's \\"Somethin' Else\\", they cover blues legend Sleepy John Estes on \\"The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair\\", one of the absolute highlights of the disc, and Jimmy Page and his slide guitar owns Robert Johnson's \\"Travelling Riverside Blues\\".  The grinding \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is here as well, of course, along with a wonderful, subtle performance of \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\", and the disc winds down with a near twelve-minute \\"How Many More Times\\". Whew!    Now, some live recordings of the Hammer of the Gods are plagued by a lack of focus by the band and erratic vocals by Robert Plant, but he is in absolute top shape on these two discs, and that's a major part of what makes the \\"BBC Sessions\\" so wonderful. That and Jimmy Page, of course.  He plays guitar like an angel who really likes the blues (!), and his slide work in particular is absolutely magnificent.    Disc two contains material recorded in 1971, including \\"Heartbreaker\\", a driving \\"Immigrant Song\\" (again, he hits all the right notes), the best live \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" ever by a longshot, and a crushing rendition of the band's best original blues number, \\"Black Dog\\".  The 18-minute \\"Dazed And Confused\\" may be a bit long to sit through for casual fans, but you can just fast-forward past the part where Page plays his Stratocaster with a violin bow.    It's hard to pick out any particulay highlights on disc two...the lovely folk song \\"Going To California\\" and the 14-minute \\"Whole Lotta Love\\"-medley, which emcompasses snatches of \\"That's Alright Mama\\", \\"A Mess Of Blues\\" and two pre-50s blues numbers, are both great in their own right.  I can't imagine any Zeppelin fan being disappointed with this wonderful album. If your idea of live Zeppelin is the semi-disappointing \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", you must pick up this CD right away. It's magnificent.
B000001EGA|5.0|This album was released in June 1975 and represented the culmination of famous pianist Elton John and lyricist Bernie Taupin's shared vision of the art of songwriting. The content is all based on their life experiences together as aspiring young musicians from 1967 (when they were first introduced to each other through a music press advertisement) to 1970 (when after several hard years of &quot;paying his dues&quot;, Elton's career suddenly took off) and weaves a story from beginnings (We All Fall In Love Sometimes) through disappointments, rejections and frustration in the &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; that was the late 60's world of the London music business (Bitter Fingers, Gotta Get A Meal Ticket) to the process of creating art itself (Writing) to the closer Curtains where they look back nostalgically to their very first compositions together (referring to &quot;Scarecrow&quot; and &quot;A Dandelion Dies In The Wind&quot; etc.). Elton is &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; and Bernie is the &quot;Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot; of the album's title, and this is all explained in the title track. The best-known song here is the US hit Someone Saved My Life Tonight- a tale of Elton's exit from an unsuitable engagement backed with a great tune and impassioned singing. The album set new records for instant popularity when first issued amidst the tidal wave of mass support Elton enjoyed during the mid 70's, but it is not really a &quot;pop&quot; record as such. Along with 1973's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, it is the best example of the partnership of Elton and Bernie at their creative best - producing a themed set of great songs that continue to be listened to and enjoyed to this day. Here, the songs were personal stories and therefore the standard of production and the lavish artwork of the cover and gatefold sleeve of the LP were of the highest order. My favourite song here is We All Fall In Love Sometimes, which is about the simple joy of finding a (platonic) soulmate to share one'sthoughts and feelings with. It has a lovely piano melody. <br />  <br /> The album is really good. <br />  <br /> The new CD version comes with the inclusion of two thematically-incompatible bonus hits that do not have anything to do with the Captain Fantastic autobiographical idea that links the other 10 tracks. Elton's 1974 version of Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is terrific, as is the 1975 single Philadelphia Freedom, but as these were single-only 7&quot; tracks not on an album, they would be best heard as part of a Greatest Hits album rather than tacked onto this album. Try to find the original CD of this with just the 10 original tracks if you can.
0066620996|5.0|I found this book both enlightening and depressing all at the same time.  I felt vindicated because I've always thought that it was the people that make or break a company, not credentials, or etc.  If you are a managment type then for God's sake stow your ego and read this book.  Take what the data says to heart.  The thing I liked about the book the most was that it showed that the pivotal people that made certain companies successful were _good_ people, not ego driven bastards.<br />The depressing thing is that only 11 companies from the Fortune 500 even qualified for the study.  That's right 11.  <br />It's an easy read and the author takes the time to make sure that you know that it's not his oppinion of the data but the data itself that presents conclusions.  This should be mandatory reading at all business schools.  5 out of 5.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Lord of the Rings is not just about men, elfs and dwarves fighting orc armies while Evil Lord seeks to regain his lost ring.    It is about the resilience of human spirit. It is about us and our desire to survive against all odds. It is about our iron will and our capability to unite and fight against common enemy who threatens our kind.    This is why Lord of the Rings has struck a chord with all those who dare to plunge into its dark depths and evil plots.    If Tolkein's book was grand with graphic details about massive orc armies threatning the middle earth, Peter Jackson's movie is well, \\"grander\\".    Director Peter Jackson brings to life what all of us could only imagine. True, some things are not exactly as they are in the book, but the changes are apt and in many cases necessary. For example, do you really want to hear all the songs Merry and Pippin sing in the books? I was relieved I didn't have to.    The movie begins with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas chasing orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin. It then progresses through Froddo's journey, his capture and later release by riders of Gondor, Aragorn's encounter with Gandalf the White, battle for Helm's Deep and Ent's battle with Saruman's armies. Of this the battle for Helm's deep stands out as the most detailed and accurate depiction of the scenes from the book. Huge Orc armies, fear and uncertainity in men, courage of Theoden King, last minute support from Elves are all recreated with all details. The only deviation from the book is that this movie ends before Gollum betrays Froddo to Shelob.    Apart from that each and every detail of the book, from elf world to Helm's Deep has been beautifully recreated. Aragorn and Arwen's fairy tale love, Gimli and Legolas' friendly, almost playfull rivalry and Froddo and Samwise Gamgee's deep bond of friendship bursts forth in a thousand colors and leaves you wondering how the director managed to do it all in such vivid details while maintaining the flow of the book andcoherency of the plot.    My favourity scenes include battle for Helm's Deep My wife's include love scenes between Arwen and Aragorn adorned with beautiful, almost delicate elf words. I am sure you will find your favourites as you watch the movies again and again.
B000068VHS|3.0|This 4th album from &quot;The Cranberries&quot; seemed to be their attempt at regaining the following they had from their 1st two albums. I don't find this to be as good front to back as others were, but some of their best songs are on &quot;Bury The Hatchet&quot;. &quot;Animal Instinct&quot; and &quot;Promises&quot; are both catchy, and therefore made good singles. Two of my favorites ever are &quot;Shattered&quot;, and the beautiful &quot;You And Me&quot;. However there's a few songs of filler, and &quot;Copycat&quot; that's just bad. The last two songs on the original album are pleasing as well, those are &quot;Fee Fi Fo&quot; and &quot;Dying In The Sun&quot;. The extra tracks here are all good, maybe not enough to buy this twice for, but good. Overall, this may not convert anyone, but fans should like it &quot;Loud And Clear&quot;.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|In short, the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across, in making people aware of the existence of Protestant fundamentalists (descendants of New England Puritans/Witchcraft in Salem/Prohibition/Bible Belt/Religious Right etc) in the USA. At the same time, however, it does not provide a balanced examination, which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create as it attacks tradition as a whole, indiscriminantly and below the belt. <br />Outdated, and so NOT original, Mona Lisa Smile is yet another (yawn) attempt/effort at presenting the \\"good\\" progressives and \\"bad\\" traditionalists. This time it's digging up the past to 1953 (!!!) as a means of creating a \\"feel good\\" movie, aimed at a naive/gullible audience as well as that specific crowd that has an appetite for such films.  It drives a wedge and divides instead of uniting people. <br />If originality is what the movie is after, it would actually BE original and courageous at the same time, if the story was set in the present, the other way around, where a small town USA teacher had to move to California or NY only to experience the current/present \\"radical\\" conditions as opposed to those from half a century ago; this time with reverse discrimination, Political Correctness, \\"Thought Police,\\" and the likes. <br />Nevertheless, the actors (especially Julia Roberts and Kirsten Dunst) are very good for the work that they have done.  <br />A more balanced and objective approach with less bias and closed mindedness would have made the film more effective and therefore, more successful. The ultimate goal is noteworthy, but the method used is not necessarily the correct one.
B00028HBKM|5.0|With out a doubt this is the best portrayal of the last hours of Jesus on earth. It is passionate, realistic and overwhelming. It will move you to tears. The greatest story ever told has never been told this greatly. The act of Christ giving His life to save us from ourselves is brilliantly portrayed. It is an excellent synthesis of the four gospels that demonstrates nearly all aspects of his trial and execution. Some of the other people around Jesus are also very well depicted, from His mother to Peter to Judas Iscariot. This gives the film a very &quot;whole&quot; feeling. Truely a wonder!!! <br />  <br /> A note to address the extremely negative reviews: Please don't let them persuade you into missing this brilliant film. Of the negative reviews that I have read, they are extremely inaccurate in how they portrayed the movie. If you are concerened about the violence in the movie please keep in mind that the vast majority of it happened at Christ's scourging...a scene easily fast forwarded through. As for the claims that the scourging is scene is unrealistic, just remember that the Roman empire was extremely good at torturing and executing people. They had hundreds of years to practice and perfect their art of butchery.

The plot was well laid and I was looking for loopholes while reading through. His stunts description are exhaustive however some I feel are relevant. I am already on to Angels & demons and cannot wait to buy Da Vinci Code...
B0000024K1|5.0|Public Enemy were perhaps the best, most influential hip-hop act of all time, and this is the greatest thing they created. Fear Of A Black Planet is the only other P.E. release in the same league and even that had some moments of filler. By the time Apocalypse '91 was released the group was already fractured from the Professor Griff controversy and past its prime. With It Takes A Nation... Chuck D., Flavor Flav, and the Bomb Squad were young, energized, angry, and at the top of their game in 1988.<br /><br /> It Takes A Nation... was hip-hop's clarion call to the world. While earlier albums from Run D.M.C., the Beastie Boys, and others proved that hip-hop could expand its sound and be more than a passing fad, Public Enemy showed that hip-hop could also be a voice for the black community and its social and political concerns. Intense, angry, militant, political, thoughtful, creative...all of the above apply to this album. While I'm no proponent of black radicalism (and think Louis Farrakhan is a nutcase), I definitely admire the intelligence and innovation that went into this recording. And contrary to what some have said, there is little that is racist about the messages in this album, though the views presented are largely Afrocentric. After all, this is the same group that later teamed up with Anthrax (a bunch of thrash metal-playing white dudes) to record &quot;Bring Tha Noize&quot; and bring about rap-metal. P.E. are trying to make people question society and history and look at the world around them, similar to what earlier punk bands like The Clash, Crass, and The Dead Kennedys have done. Pretty powerful stuff.<br /><br /> Love him or hate him, you ignore Chuck D. at your own peril. His prescence as an M.C. and lyricist is virtually unrivalled. While he's not as technically skilled as say, Rakim, he's definitely no slouch, and his lyrics are very thought-provoking, eloquent and downright quotable expressions of righteous indignation at the American prison system, pop culture &quot;values,&quot; the inner-city drug epidemic, the federal government (&quot;You're CIA, you see I ain't kiddin'&quot;), the media, and the watered-down history we're fed in public school textbooks, among other things. A far cry from today's common topics of &quot;bling and b-tches,&quot; that's for sure. Flavor Flav fills the role of jester, dropping humourous rhymes in between Chuck D.'s blasts of venom--smart writers know that polemics go down a little easier with a dash of humor (a lesson that all too many would-be political songwriters forget).<br /><br /> If the Rick Rubin/Bomb Squad production sounds dated these days (and I think it has stood up brilliantly, not something you can say for most hip-hop albums), it's because so many later hip-hop artists and producers have ripped it off. There's free jazz sax squeals, funky beats, excellent samples (my favorite is that MLK Jr. sample which, if I remember correctly, kicks off Night Of The Living Baseheads), and some crazy turntable scratching from Terminator X. On She Watch Channel Zero?, even a Slayer sample is used to awesome effect, proving already that metal can make an excellent hip-hop backdrop. Like Paul's Boutique by the Beastie Boys, It Takes A Nation... is worth listening to for its production alone.<br /><br /> Bring The Noise, Don't Believe The Hype (practically an anti-media anthem), Louder Than A Bomb, Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos (coolest title EVER!), Prophets Of Rage, Party For Your Right To Fight...all classic hip-hop. To all those who think Eminem is &quot;thought-provoking&quot; or &quot;original&quot; I'd advise you to pick this up and experience the real thing.son system, pop culture &quot;values,&quot; the inner-city drug epidemic, the federal government (&quot;You're CIA, you see I ain't kiddin'&quot;), the media, and the watered-down history we're fed in public school textbooks, among other things.

B00005B36H|2.0|Why are so many people praising this album?    Is it so ingenious that simple minded people like myself think its just loads of noise droning on and on when in fact its a god send to intellects everywhere. The first tool song i ever heard was prison sex, which i adored. I also enjoy maynards other vocal efforts in a band called A Perfect Circle (which i highly recommend). I bought this cd with all the best intentions in the world. I knew it was a cd for &quot;clever&quot; people so i got home, went to my room and began listening in the hope that i would soon be absorbed in some musical masterpiece. I lasted 2 minutes, before i put the cd back in its case, vowing i would listen to it some other time, perhaps when i could get into it more. I thought it was me you see, since every body else is praising it to the skies. Well its been six months and ive got a cold, not wanting to go out i got bored quickly and was browsing my cd rack when i came upon it again. Right, i thought, now is the time. I pressed play and lay down on the couch. Then a peculiar thing happened. I hadn't been able to sleep at all due to my cold, but low and behold i actually drifted off! I never do this, i was awoken a couple of times to some middle eastern wailing but quickly drifted straight back into slumber. I was harshly woken with a start to some sort of distorted radio noise with some hysterical man in the background harping about extraterrestrial beings and area 51, it totally freaked me out. I thought id made some kind of contact, then abruptly the cd came to an end and i was left in a sleepy confusion. I have decided that this cd should be used only for an alternative to sleeping pills or for tripping out on. Other then that it looks good with its pretty inside cover, and you can brag to people how brilliant it is and make them envious because they secretly don't get it either, it just makes them look good.    And all the people that are about to hit the un-helpfull button, go ahead, stayin denial. I thrive on negativity....Ahhhhh!   If you want to buy a cd that improves your existence then buy Begins Here by The Butterfly Effect. The vocalist is even better than Maynard, yes its true, pick yourself up off the floor.
B000002MP2|3.0|(NOTE: I hated my original review for this album, as I do some of my other old reviews. I would update them all but that would ultimately be counterproductive. This one, though, deserves to be rectified)<br /><br /> Green Day is clearly pop-punk, and Dookie is often the album reviled for bringing the genre into the mainstream and being responsible for horrid bands like Blink-182, Sum41, Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, and the like. But is it that bad an album, really?<br /><br /> I'd have to say no. Sure, Green Day is derivative--clearly indebted to UK and American punk bands with poppier leanings, like The Buzzcocks, The Jam, The Descendents, and Husker Du. But this band does a good job of drawing on those influences and had a distinct sound (at least distinct from the numerous NOFX ripoffs). The music on here is fun, catchy, and ultimately pretty damn good. Billie Joe Armstrong actually has personality--his endearing stoner-kid voice isn't Pro-Tooled to death. Tre Cool (drums) and Mike Dirnt (bass) are a good rhythm section. The songs are good across the board, though I'd have to say the highlights are Burnout, Chump, Longview, Sassafras Roots, When I Come Around, and Coming Clean. Lots of catchy melodies and good lyrics obsessed with teenage alienation, girls, and getting stoned (sounds a bit like the formula laid down by a certain four-piece band of &quot;bruddas&quot; from NYC, doesn't it?).<br /><br /> Anyway, Dookie may not be groundbreaking but I still enjoy it, and there's no reason why you shouldn't either. Unless of course you're trying to look hip in front of your Black Flag-worshipping friends.
0156027321|5.0|Think &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; with a lifeboat for an island, solar stills for livestock, and a 450-pound Friday with fangs, and, oh, Daniel Defoe would be proud! There is next to nothing wrong with this book. Yann Martel takes us on a suspenseful and philisophical journey of the human spirit through the eyes of an adolescent Indian castaway who is one of the most masterfully developed characters in this reader's recent memory. To go on would be a crime against the work's future audience. That means you. Brush up on your nautical terms and then go get lost in it.
B000002I55|3.0|I can't imagine what kind of stir Coleman's groundbreaking Free Jazz LP must've created back in 1960, especially considering how unique it still sounds to this day. Ornette courted serious controversy within the conservative jazz world, and this album created a schizm in the world of traditional jazz--Ayler, Dolphy, Sun Ra, and later Coltrane all owe their sound, in varying degrees, to this 1960 &quot;collective improvisation.&quot;<br /><br /> Other reviews have said it before, but I am going to emphasize again that this is NOT easy listening. Somebody buying this expecting obvious melodies or a pleasant lack of dissonance (like Ornette's own The Shape Of Jazz To Come) will find listening to this a seriously unpleasant experience. I myself find a good deal of this hard to take. I'm not a big fan of free jazz, but I acknowledge its importance to the progression of jazz as a form. If nobody took chances like this we'd all be stuck listening to the same 4/4 melodic bop and swing.<br /><br /> What's interesting about this recording is that it is NOT totally &quot;free&quot; from structure. The first take, included on this disc as a bonus track, is a rehearsal (!). To my knowledge the closest thing to totally &quot;free&quot; jazz is Coltrane's later record Ascension, which is influenced heavily by this recording but does away with all but the most rudimentary rhythmic bases. Another interesting thing about Free Jazz is the &quot;double quartet&quot; band configuration, with a doubled rhythm section. I'm tempted to say that Robert Fripp of King Crimson was listening to this album while assembling his own &quot;double trio&quot; and recording the album THRAK (go check that album out, by the way) but that's just speculation on my part.<br /><br /> What &quot;free&quot; refers to in this case is the lack of key and harmonic center. There IS melody, it can be found but it takes a determined set of ears and a love of abstract musical ideas and theory. Billy Higgins and Ed Blackwell's drums are playing mostly conventional rhythms, though not always in 4/4. The whole album is quite spirited and uptempo, firmly in the Charlie Parker bop tradition (who was one of Ornette's most prominent influences) but abandoning the restrictions of that genre. There are some great moments on this recording--my favorite is the dual bass &quot;conversation&quot; between Charlie Haden and Scott LeFaro. There are other pretty cool moments of interplay, and some great Coleman skronk too, but listening to all of this jam takes an open mind and plenty of patience.<br /><br /> All persons interested in the history of modern jazz, particularly free jazz and fusion, should listen to this recording at least once even if it is tough rowing. But don't start here with Coleman or you may be soured on the rest of his work. Get thoroughly acquainted with the usual suspects (Miles, Monk, Parker, Coltrane, Mingus) and buy The Shape Of Jazz To Come before you listen to Free Jazz.ns and Ed Blackwell's drums are playing mostly conventional rhythms, though not always in 4/4.

B00005JLT5|5.0|What a tremendous impact this film contains! Not only are we witness to the horrors of pure hatred taken to the extreme but we are faced to contrast obscurity with the beauty of music.  <br /> <br />This true story of Polish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, will make you appreciate life and question your own character faced with having to survive such brutal circumstances. Imagine losing your home, your family, your friends, your dignity and then being faced with confronting death, not just as a situation, but as a horrible daily darkness that appears never ending. Left alone in a world destroyed as you know it, to fend for yourself by eating garbage and by checking the pockets of the rotting dead who surround you, would you, could you survive? Well Mr. Szpilman did and this film is a tribute to a true war hero. Although he may not be fighting with machine guns and grenades and he may not be actively filled with pompous arrogance, this war movie exposes Szpilman's character as a most worthy human being who sat in the pits of hell and came out on the other side a man capable of beautiful symphonic music.  <br /> <br />Polanski does an excellent job as director on this film by capturing subtle nuances alongside of the absolute horror to create a deep emotion within his viewers. He chooses to cloak this film in the colors of despair, grays, dirty beiges, all muted in tone and begging for light and brightness. We are only allowed to see the greenest of grasses towards the film's end. Many scenes in other movies have captured the horror of the cattle scenes, in which thousands of Jewish people are rounded up into freight cars and carried away to their ultimate deaths, but Polanski films a scene that ripped me to pieces just by the jarring sound of a metal lock closing on a freight car filled with life. Polanski also manages to convey the humiliation suffered by the Jewish people and not just how their lives were destroyed but also their dignity. He stays true to the humanness of his characters and in doing so never loses their impact throughout the entire film. <br /> <br />What can we say about Adrien Brody? Simply that he is stunning! Brody becomes Szpilman and he personifies the walking dead. His entire being changes throughout this film, at first classy and dignified he transforms into a fragile beaten man who manages to feel a simple spark of recognition for life that keeps him moving. My heart ached with every step this tortured man took and cheered beside his undying ability to survive. Brody's walk becomes staggered and painful, his broad shoulders begin to stoop with burden, his mouth twists with scurvy and disease and his eyes reside in tragedy only to find some brightness with each chance survived. His hands become the instrument that seals his fate, sometimes elegant and well groomed and sometimes weak representations of their true abilities across a few dusty piano keys.  <br /> <br />This movie is a must have. It will stay with you for days and hopefully for an entire lifetime. We can only pray this devastating reality never touches our shores but as life goes hate somehow manages to exist. I hope that when faced with a moment of boredom, a pang of hunger or that furious glimpse of anger we can all remember this heroic story about Mr. Szpilman and that we allow it to change us into better representations of the human race. The truth is told in this movie and it must be respected and learned from because stemming from the bowels of hate the most beautiful music can arise if we strive to find it. <br />
B0000AM6LY|2.0|I live in Holland and the only two songs played on the radio here were 'Sunrise' and 'you make me feel brand new'. <br />I loved and still love sunrise, but I considered 'you make me feel brand new' a pretty dull song. <br />A week ago I bought this cd second hand for 2.5 euro and after listening to it for a few times I found you make me feel brand new to be one of the better songs. So actually the only song worth listening to is Sunrise, giving the album 2 stars, since the rest of the songs are below mediocre to very bad.
B00000K0E5|5.0|<br />'Goldeneye' is one of the best James Bond films ever made, a film that really brought the 007 series into the 1990s and revitalised it from the struggling genre that it had become in the 80s to the blockbuster success it was in the 90s and still is today. <br /> <br />The story is an interesting one, and at first we see a mission into Russia go horribly wrong, leaving 006 dead and with 007(Bond) just managing to escape. <br /> <br />From there, the story jumps ahead nine years and we see Bond on the trail of the mysterious criminal syndicate Janus.  What Bond discovers during his investigations is a deadly stranger from his past, a man who betrayed Queen and country, 006 (Alec Trevelyan).  <br /> <br />From there, Bond pursues Trevelyan through the streets of Russia in an armoured tank, and from there to Cuba, where the deadly plan of Trevelyan is exposed, and the final confrontation between 007 and 006. <br /> <br />The film is simply brilliant, with an engaging story and actors that bring fresh faces and a new spin to the usual Bond characters (except for Q, who is his usual charming self). Pierce Brosnan sinks into the role of 007 effortlessly, he simply IS Bond. <br /> <br />Judi Dench also brings a new twist to the role of M, and it is her character that voices some of the political changes that have swept the world since the end of the Cold War. The scene between M and Bond in M's office is simply electric, probably the best I've ever seen between Brosnan and Dench. <br /> <br />But in my opinion, the actor that really shines in 'Goldeneye' is Sean Bean. As usual, he plays a conflicted antagonist, the bad guy who isn't totally evil, and he does it with real style. His character, unlike other Bond villians, represents a very personal enemy to Bond, a trusted colleague who turned his back on everything that Bond lives to protect, Queen and Country, making the confrontations all the more interesting. In my opinion, the last scene between Bond and Trevelyanis one of the best finales I have ever seen in a 007 film, brilliant writing, fantastic acting, all put together with some beautiful camerawork. <br /> <br />On a more practical note, I must express my sadness that the 'Goldeneye' DVD is no longer available, at least not in Region 4. It was not on the market for very long, and now every shop and website reports the same thing, 'no longer available'. If MGM want to build up the 007 franchise, particularly with a new Bond on the way, then putting 'Goldeneye' back on the market would certainly help. <br /> <br />I recommend the film to all moviegoers, whether Bond fans or not, it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family. <br /> <br />
0316168815|5.0|Great book with a very powerful story; not to be read by those who like nice novels with \\"they-lived-happily-ever-after\\" endings.<br /><br /> Although you could say that the book is very sad and could at some point kind of depress you I found it really absorbing to the point that I finished it in three long, sleepless nights.<br /><br /> You have to realize that this was a book written by an author that was a victim of rape herself, and that is clearly reflected in the mood of the book. In fact the author and the main character share a lot in common.<br /><br /> Despite the, at times, dark mood of the book some parts of it are very inspiring. At times you may wonder why you're reading a story filled with so much suffering and sadness, but then you will reach those parts where the author just gets to your heart with the kindness and love of some of the characters.<br /><br /> There are a few pages that remind you of scenes from the movie \\"Ghost\\" and others that remind you of the movie \\"What Dreams May Come\\" with Robin Williams.<br /><br /> I loved the fact that because the story is being told by the dead teenager the author was able to use an omniscient first person voice. It made it more entertaining to be able to read the story in first person and at the same time to know what all the characters are thinking and feeling.<br /><br /> If you think you will be able to get through all the sadness and suffering, and even tears, that this book may throw your way, you could find it very rewarding and touching.<br /><br /> Give it a try!

B00008NRL8|4.0|(This review was originally posted for the first release.) <br />  <br /> In Argentina (and else where), there is always a debate on whether a new composition should be considered tango. Many of the songs from &quot;the Golden Age of Tango&quot; created their own shares of controversy when they first came out in the first half of the 20th century. Of course, then there was Astor Piazzolla, whose music to this day still manages to upset certain self-proclaimed purists.  <br />  <br /> The Gotan Project attempts to amalgamate tango with other contemporary musical elements. There were negative reviews, both on and off lines, that claimed that it was sacrilegious and ultimately not tango. I would like these people to listen again carefully, because I could point to segments where the reference to classic tango is very obvious. <br />  <br /> For example, on track 5 (&quot;Santa Maria&quot;), if you pay close attention and use a little imagination, the opening sounds just like &quot;La Yumba&quot; by Osvaldo Pugliese (more similar to the 1952 version; the 1946 version sounds too weak in most recordings.) And on track 6 (Una Musica Brutal), part of the rubato from the middle section came almost directly from &quot;Quejas de bandoneon&quot; by Anibal Troilo.  <br />  <br /> And the last track &quot;vuelvo al sur&quot; was truly interesting. Most of us in the tango world are probably familiar with the version sung by Roberto Goyeneche (from the 1987? film &quot;Sur&quot;). His scratchy voice in conjunction with Piazzolla's bandoneon made this song one of the darkest, heaviest, and the most haunting tangos I know of. The Gotan Project version is not as dense, but the contemporary rhythms seem to add an urban destitute and desolateness that are ironically appropriate, considering the current situation in Buenos Aires.  <br />  <br /> Some of the other original compositions are very interesting too. Overall, most of the tracks carry the quintessential &quot;tango feeling&quot;that connects this album to the century-old lineage of tango music. I applaud them for their courage to bring in new elements to tango. I think there is a fundamental question for tango music aficionados today: there are many excellent tango music groups that imitate the styles of the classic &quot;orquestas tipicas&quot;. The most popular subjects of imitation are Osvaldo Pugliese, Juan D'arienzo, and Carlos Di Sarli. These three orchestras produced more than 1,000 recordings, many of which are considered &quot;Gold Standards&quot; for the particular songs. Do we still want some &quot;new&quot; recordings that may sound like an cheap imitation to the Gold Standards? When we buy a new tango CD next time, do we still want yet another rendition of &quot;La cumparsita&quot; or &quot;El choclo&quot;?  <br />  <br /> I am writing here as someone who had fallen in love with tango from the Golden Age and had spent quite a bit of time reading about it and listening to endless hours of Pugliese and Troilo. Here in New York, we are fortunate enough to have two regular tango groups that perform in milongas and I adore both of them dearly. I love the tango from the 1940s and 50s but from I learn from its history, it is vital for tango to renovate itself every generation to sustain its existence 50 years after its Golden Age. Whether you like the music or not, I believe that the Gotan Project had at least made that courageous attempt.
0920668364|1.0|I received this book as a gift prior to having my daughter. I would throw it away, but feel bad doing so because it was a gift. Right now it is hanging in my office at work and is used to make jokes about it. People that come in say throw it away! It is so creepy it is gross. Yes, the illustrations represent the story line, but that is not a good thing. The first page is cute, then as he gets older, the mother on her hands and knees crawls over and peeks at her son (on one page of her doing this, it looks like she has on white gloves like she is going to do something) and waits until he is alseep and if he is &quot;really&quot; asleep she will pick him up and sing to him. This goes on every night, until he is an adult. One graphic at night she attaches a ladder to the car and drives across town. She puts the ladder to his window and climbs up to make sure he is really asleep, and if he was she would pick him up and sing to him. He is roughly 40 years old and she is climbing into his window and picking him up! In the picture the cat looks like it is trying to escape the sickness that is going on. Finally, the mother isn't well and he goes to her home and picks her up and sings to her. The last page, he does this to his son.  <br /> This is a creepy book. This mother not only needed to &quot;cut the apron strings&quot;, but check into the nearest mental hospital.
B000089RVX|5.0|I really like the CD a lot, great voice too......there's a band from here in Chicago called A.D.D. that are very similar except that they're heavier. Which is wayyyy cool. Kicking tunes too !! Check them out at [...] <br />
B00005B36H|5.0|As the band's singer, Maynard James Keenan, once said of TOOL's music in an interview years ago, &quot;it's not just about jumping up and down to some catchy phrase.&quot; This is not death metal to which you can simply burst into frantic convulsions and be following the rhythm. This is real musicianship and beyond. This is for those who enjoy challenges, questions, and introspection. You will not hear any propogandized messages in this music, instructing the listener on how the world is, but, rather, suggestions to consider and decide upon for oneself. <br />  <br /> All this is set to a the musical backdrop of Danny Carey's deep, rolling percussion work, the usual complex guitar performances of Adam Jones and Justin Chancellor, and, finally, Maynard's vocals that seperate TOOL from any other group on the planet. While TOOL's earlier albums (Opiate & Undertow) focused on quicker, harder, louder, higher sounds, and nima moved a slightly more relaxed tempo and reverberating bass tone, Lateralus demonstrates TOOL's development into something more complex and plotted. Each song has its own transformation, beginning, and end, rather than being simply 1 piece in the album's plot. The album focuses even more on Justin's bass and Danny's masterful use of the toms--enhanced in the time since their last release, through studying with Tabla master Aloke Dutta. This album has a much more mysterious and darkly intriguing feel than any of their others. Time changes are frequent and worked to perfection. Finally, Maynard's implementation of smoother, slower vocals to link together his more primal rage-driven spurts. This is the genius of the album, and one which no other singer (except maybe Jason Radford, formerly of onesidezero and now of Abloom) can produce. <br />  <br /> All in all, this is a masterpiece that takes the listener on a journey through the subconscious and the depths of oneself, the intricacies of which never cease to amaze--the lyrics of the title track, Lateralus, follow the Fibonacci sequence up and down in their rhythm, while maintaining musical consistency. TOOL has maintained the anger and frustration that they harnessed in their previous endeavours, but has now learned how to utilize these elements in the right places, and how to fill the space between with softer, yet even more eery passages. This is not an addition to their body of work, but rather the product of its evolution.
1402541775|5.0|This series of African stories is a wonderful read, but an even more enjoyable listen. While reading these books, I sometimes become distracted and skip over some of the rich descriptions of the African landscape and people. But these tapes are wonderful! They are narrated by Lisette Lecat, a native South African, who is absolutely perfect for the job. We took them along on vacation and played them in the car while driving 7 hours. Initially, my 11 year old son made fun of Mma Ramotswe and said the tape was &quot;lame&quot; but by the end of our trip he was hooked on the stories too. Definitely worth purchasing, even if you have read the books. You will finally know how to pronounce all of the African names!
1594200106|5.0|From the first sentence to the last I was enthralled in the action of the plot of this book.  I never reread a book and I will reread this book someday.  I hope I am fortunate to read another book by this author.
B000002MT0|4.0|One thing I can say about Prince's 1994 album, &quot;Come&quot; is that it's really not like typical Prince albums. To me, it's a strange, dark, and bitter record. It's also a &quot;contractual obligation&quot; record. It was not an album Prince set out to make, but it helped get Warner Bros. off his back. Anyway, the first thing I noticed about &quot;Come&quot; was the strange and creepy, black and white cover photo. The photo shows Prince standing in front a black metal gate with &quot;Prince 1958-1993&quot; in bold, white letters. When I saw this album, I asked myself, &quot;what the heck is this&quot;? When I listened to this album, the first things that came out of Prince's mouth was &quot;If you're 18 and over, come here, I got something for your mind&quot;. Oh yes, the title track, &quot;Come&quot;, is a dirty little song, but the jazzy instrumentation is amazing. The song itself is long, runing 11 minutes long. It has a lot of jazzy horns being played over a lone drum machine. The song also has some of Prince's most daring lyrics ever. The next song, &quot;Space&quot; is another one of those interesting gems. It's a strange, mid-tempo techno tune. It's really a sexy tune. &quot;Pheromone&quot; is one of the most graphic and pornographic tunes on here. It's another one of those typical funky and upbeat, New Power Generation-type songs. The next tune, &quot;Loose&quot; is a funky, club song with powerful beats. It also has Prince rapping. &quot;Papa&quot; is the best song on &quot;Come&quot;. Yeah, it's a song about fathers abusing their children. One of the most disturbing and daring parts of this song is when he says: &quot;Don't abuse children, or they'll end up like me&quot;. It's a real deep and personal song with Prince speaking many of the lyrics. &quot;Race&quot; is another dance-funk track. It's an ode about racism. &quot;Dark&quot; is one of those typical soul, Prince ballads. I think the remix, &quot;So Dark&quot;, from his 1998 album, Crystal Ball, is much better than this one, though. &quot;Solo&quot; is the only weak song on here. The song does display Prince's amazing vocal range, but it's boring. It sounds like he's singing at a funeral. &quot;Letitgo&quot; is a Prince pop standard and it's probably the most popular song on this album. &quot;Orgasm&quot; is really daring. The song has his now-ex-wife, Mayte faking some sexy moans. The song doesn't have any instruments being played or lyrics being sang. I really consider it as a brief outro. It left me wondering of what I've just experienced on this record. All in all, &quot;Come&quot; is one of Prince's darkest records of the 90's. Let me warn you, if you think this is another Purple Rain, Diamonds And Pearls, and 1999 record, full of bubblegum and glossy pop tunes, you better think again. This album is utterly dark and bitter. &quot;Come&quot; is such an amazing record, but keep this in mind, it's not for everybody. B+
B0002DB52M|1.0|Oh, man, I hated this film -- and I'm someone who can find something to like in almost any movie, any genre. And I didn't even hate it in a way that would inspire comment or conversation, but simply as a needlessly brutal exercise in one man's prejudice (von Trier) against, well, just about everything. But most of all America and its ideas.<br /><br /> This is a film that uglifies everything it depicts, everything it touches. The film seems coated with a layer of grime. It depicts gang rape, mass murder, the ugliest sides of human nature, while supposedly presenting an overly stagey &quot;parable&quot; (Our Town-style, on a mostly empty set) about small towns and (most of all) America. Von Trier's view is disturbing, ugly, needlessly brutal, and in the end a betrayal of all the amazing actors who worked on the film.<br /><br /> The performances are great, and I give 1 star for them alone. Nicole Kidman in particular manages to stay luminous and poignant even through violence, brutality, gang rape, ugliness, murder, you name it. I know some admire this film, but to me its pretensions to art were mostly what offended me about it. The film is a paen to Von Trier's simplistic view that America is corrupt and (ultimately) hopeless. I love America but I do so with a mind as well as a heart; I don't mind discourse, exploration, etc., as a pathway to ideas.<br /><br /> But to me this film ultimately is pretentious slop, a way for this guy to wage his one-man war against American ideas and daily life by painting a truly ugly picture and saying, &quot;See yourself there?&quot; I love dark stuff, but no, I didn't. I actually felt sorry for Von Trier -- at this point I feel he's someone who only seems to see what he wants, which most of the time seems to be the worst in people.<br /><br /> Ultimately the story is so silly and over the top that I wasn't even angry -- I felt like I'd watched something completely ludicrous. The film doesn't work even as a parable, despite the few favorable reviews mentioning names like &quot;Shirley Jackson,&quot; etc. The film has nothing in common with Jackson's quiet devastation -- Von Trier would rather hit you over the head with a hammer to make a point.<br /><br /> Stay away from this one, it's not worth a rental, much less an actual purchase.pite the few favorable reviews mentioning names like &quot;Shirley Jackson,&quot; etc. The film has nothing in common with Jackson's quiet devastation -- Von Trier would rather hit you over the head with a hammer to make a point. <br />  <br /> Stay away from this one, it's not worth a rental, much less an actual purchase.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|DOWN WITH ALTERNATIVE!! UP WITH REAL MUSIC!!! WHILE NOT BEING AS METAL AS OTHER ROCK REVIVAL BANDS LIKE ANDREW WK AND THE DARKNESS, JET HAS THE RIGHT IDEA: PLAY SLEAZY, HARD, ROCK, WITH NO ALTERNATIVE INFLUENCES WHATSOEVER. JET'S MAGNIFICENT 'GET BORN' SOUNDS VERY 70'S, NOT AT ALL LIKE THE MODERN ROCK SCENE. SINCE THEY ARE FROM THE SAME COUNTRY AS THEIR APPARENT HEROES, AC/DC, THEY PUT A LOT OF INFLUENCE FROM THAT BAND, BUT ALSO FROM THE ROLLING STONES AND UNDERGROUND 70'S BANDS LIKE DUST AND GRANICUS.

0553382179|4.0|After 3 kids and moving 4 times in 7 years(which includes buying and selling my houses!) I was semi-organized.  I knew how to make a house look clean and spacious for house-hunters, I knew how to keep things clean and safe enough for a toddler or a puppy, but I didn't know how to routinely clear out my entry way or what to do about my Fibber McGee closets.  After all, if you aren't actually selling your house, you shouldn't have most of your closet's contents in storage facilities, should you? <br />  FlyLady turned me from a 'fairly neat' person into someone who could safely open all her closet doors.  There are no spiderwebs on my front porch anymore or spices older then the oldest of my children in my spice cabinet.  I even have a file cabinet!  with labeled files! No more boxes of papers in their third decade. <br />    The freedom you gain from thinking about FlyLady's guidelines and adopting them to you is indescribable.  I no longer feel like my stuff owns me.   <br />  If you are like me, somewhat organized but kinda dusty and cluttered around the edges, read this book.  Dust will be an endangered species in your home and you will rule over your stuff. <br />    Debbie

Now 25 years later I purchased this DVD set and learned and used the lessons to some small degree in my life for the better.There is no Show like this. This truly is one of a kind and I am glad to have been able to enjoy and learn from each one. As a wise saying from Caine goes <br /> <br />Man: What do I do now? <br />Caine: LIVE! (Now,not tommorow or yesterday) <br /> <br />Few words, great lesson to enjoy this short life.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I loved this Harry Potter soundtrack. It was more mature than the first two soundtracks, like the film itself has matured. The songs are beautiful, and I just love it. Especially A Window to the Past. That has got to be the most beautiful piece I've ever heard..
B000002J1U|5.0|In Led Zeppelin I we were first immursed into the musical sensation know as Led Zeppelin. Their blues background was very easy to see with songs like Babe I'm Gonna Leave You and You Shook Me. And their hard rock heritage was very apparant in their second album. In many ways Led Zeppelin III was a colaboration of the blues (Since I've Been Loving You), hard rock (Immigrant Song), acoustics (That's the Way), and some folk (Bron Y-Aur Stomp). Many new instruments were incorporated into this album including the mandolin, dulcimer, and banjo. In my opinion Led Zeppelin III is the bands artistic peak, and has the best variety of sound showing the array of Zeppelin's musical arsenal. <br /> <br />For short, buy this album. You will not regret the purchase.
0671027344|4.0|Who wasn't an insecure mess in high school? The narrator of this book may take that to another level of intensity, but the worries, thoughts, and hopes he expresses seem nearly universal. This is a story we all know (or may even feel we've lived), presented in an interesting and unique new way. I definitely recommend it.
0312263120|2.0|This book is what it is, which is a poorly written, highly predictable, cookie-cutter type of fiction that goes down real easy. The dialog is awful, the coincidences are truly astounding, and the action is truly unbelievable. (Who would believe that in this era, multiple gunshots in an airport - no matter what time of day - would not bring down a swift response by security personnel?) <br /> <br />Having said all that, this book is a quick read and suitable diversion for a plane trip. It is not nearly as good as the Davinci Code, however.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|With Gavin DeGraws new &quot;stripped&quot; charriot album you definatly feel the intimacy he wanted the fans to feel. The mood of the album is carefree and very relaxing. Because he recorded it while touring and while his musical talents were exploring new boundaries, you get a different feel from the stripped album. All in all it's a great production especially for those of us who unfortunately missed him in concert. <br /> Tracy
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I don't know exactly what it is, but something keeps bringing me back to this album.  I'm not particularly religious (though I do believe in God, but I won't go into detail, because it's irrelevant in this review).   <br /> <br />I loved Spock's Beard (still do) since the first moment I heard them.  Aside from being wildly awesome musicians who mixed catchy and progressive music like few others, Neal Morse put his heart into the music like no one else.  I think that's why I like this album so much.  There's so much honesty and heart, that I can't help being moved every time I hear it, even just by one song.  <br /> <br />In addition to that, Neal is of course an incredibly talented musician who knows how to write a great song (or, many great songs).  I recommend this album, as well as his other two solo albums and all the Spock's Beard stuff.  And Transatlantic.
B000008M1P|4.0|The 80's were great, there were so many cool bands. Vixen was right in there with the best (and worst) of them. An all girl band that teased their hair to the moon, wore a lot of make up, and shopped at the same clothing shops as Poison and Warrant.<br /><br />My first taste of them was MTV of course and their first single 'Edge of a Broken Heart'. My initial thoughts were this is a catchy tune, and Janet Gardner (lead vox) was the most beautiful woman on the planet. She was smokin! I bought the album that week, actually it was a tape way back in 1988, and I bought it with a gift certificate I had won from Camelot Music.<br /><br />For those who enjoy or need a light album of rock every now and then, Vixen's debut should do you good. You can listen to the whole album straight through. No clunkers here. My personal faves are 'Edge of a Broken Heart', 'Cruisin', and 'I want you to Rock me'.<br /><br />I really missed them for a long time, then Tangerine came out. That's a different review, but that album is awesome. Well worth the wait.
6305014140|5.0|Probably one of the best anime's I've ever seen. It is definitely heavy on the sex and violence. Lots of blood and gore. If you mind that, you may not like the anime, but if your the sort of person who likes anime in general, which is frequently on the adult side, this is great stuff. <br />  <br /> Spoiler- The guy who said that the &quot;water killed the demon ending was stupid&quot; didn't know what the hell he was talking about. The demon didn't die, that was the point. It was encased in gold and then plummeted to the bottom of the ocean, and was unable to come back up because it was too heavy.... Worse then death basically, since it would be down their forever, theoretically.

A little bit of trivia for ya---NO SOUNDTRACK was ever released because the movie big shots didn't think the movie would do all that well at the box office. STARSHIP'S song NOTHING'S GONNA STOP US NOW was released as a single on 45 because it was so popular. Sadly, the other songs in the movie, BELINDA CARLISE'S IN MY WILDEST DREAMS was never released & ALISHA'S DO YOU DREAM ABOUT ME was only available on her 1987 solo album which is now out of print. In 2007 will be its 20th anniversary since the movie was released. You'd think they'd rerelease it on DVD or put out a soundtrack.

0312263120|3.0|A lot of people here have written about incorrect information regarding Brown's computer-science-story about the &quot;Bergofsky Principle&quot; on which the whole story is based. <br />  <br /> However he's also incorrect about a lot of other things: <br /> * The first computer was built by Konrad Zuse in Berlin <br /> in the early 1940s and not at Harvard.  <br /> * From whatever source he got his German, it's incorrect. <br /> For example addressing someone like &quot;Wer bist Du?&quot; is <br /> not what a native speaker (and Brown's character is one) <br /> would say, instead it's &quot;Wer sind Sie?&quot; There are <br /> several other flaws in German.. His choice of &quot;typical&quot; <br /> German names is also somewhat curious, he uses what someone <br /> unfamiliar with Germany would use as &quot;typical German&quot; which <br /> might have been correct in the mid of the last century but <br /> not nowadays. <br /> * Obviously Brown has some bad imagination about Spain <br /> as being a Third-World-country which is definitely not <br /> true. Bribery, not enough medicine and stuff is nice <br /> story-telling but as false as for any other industrialized <br /> nation. <br />  <br /> However the story is nice - one has to neglect the points above and it&quot;s fine reading. <br />

0156029065|4.0|a richly articulated and thoroughly descriptive adventure that ultimately did not hold my attention as much as the others (Rose/Pendulum/Island) did. I'm not sure if Eco simply blew me away or put me to sleep with this one. Either way, I'd rather read anything from this master before 90% of the rest of contemporary writers. What is lacking in the dynamic/excitement category is more than made up for by Eco's eloquent and powerfully written prose that proves elegant and enriching.
B00028HBKM|2.0|The sheer brutality of this film brings to question the actual purpose Mel had in making this film. In a society obsessed by cinema violence, I do not apologize for doubting motives. Was it biblically based. In part...but that part relates to the dialogue which was certainly not the directed appeal of this movie. Show me any section of the bible which depicts what was portrayed on film. The biblical readings go to short lengths to actually describe the beatings Jesus underwent, which consumed over an hour and a half of Mel's &quot;biblically based&quot; horror film. Show me biblical reference to Lucifer in Jesus's dying hours as so exhaustively portrayed in the movie.  <br /> P.S. Stop giving Mel so much credit for spending 25M of his own money to create this movie. I am quite sure he didn't lose too much money from this movie. For Glory or for Money...God bless anyone who saw this movie and became a believer from it. Just make sure you understand why you believe. Read the bible, don't just watch the Passion. <br /> P.S.S. For those who were offended for anti-sematism...Go get a history lesson.
6305537321|1.0|I never write review here but I had to point something out. I am a fan of Audrey Hepburn but there are many reasons why I think that &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; was a poor movie. Some of which is that a bad story line is made beautiful by use of the perfect music, perfect lighting, perfect camera filters, perfect actors, etc. Hollywood has perfected the art of emotion manipulation and this movie would be the pinnacle of the art. <br />  <br /> But the main reason that pushed me to write an review was that Mickey Rooney portrays an Asian landlord as buck-toothed, near-sighted minstrel. Do we still laugh at African Americans depicted in blackface minstrel in anyother classics? But yet most current audience / reviewers still think Mr. Rooney's depiction of Asian character was hilarious (please read other's reviews). How is this possible? <br />  <br /> I don't blame Audrey Hepburn, Mickey Rooney or even the director as racists. They would have to have been an very advanced social thinker to notice the offensiveness of their portrayal in their time. But I do blame the current audience for not finding it offensive now. Ask yourself if you are an intelligent thinking person but still find Mickey Rooney's character funny and why. <br />  <br /> I am force to post this review in the future to point this issue out. This isn't to hit you over the head with my point. But old reviews get buried over with newer reviews and this is an issue that should not be buried. <br /> === <br /> Go see &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; with Audrey Hepburn if you really want to see a great romantic movie. <br />  <br />
B0000U5RO4|3.0|Johnny English, played by Rowan Atkinson, is quite possibly the worst secret agent ever.  Unfortunately, due to a horrible turn of events, he is left as the sole protector of England.   The Crown Jewels have been stolen and Johnny English is on the case!  Working as his assistant, Bough, played by Ben Miller, keeps English on track and out of trouble. Lorna Campbell, an Interpol agent, played by Natalie Imbruglia, is the typical \\"Bond girl\\", while Pascal Sauvage, played by John Malkovich, is the villain trying to take over England. <br /> <br />Johnny English, released in 2003 by Universal Studios with a running time of 87 minutes, features a fun sound track and was nominated for Best Comedy Film by the British Comedy Awards.  Peter Howitt directed. <br /> <br />I give this movie three stars out of five.  It was an entertaining movie, but not nearly as funny as I had hoped.  It is, however, a movie that you can watch with your whole family without a lot of sexual innuendos and bad language. The humor ran along the lines of \\"poo\\" jokes and it seemed to be very reminiscent of \\"Mr. Bean\\" and his foolish antics.  If you are a \\"James Bond\\" enthusiast, this in not the movie for you. <br />
B000063DFN|3.0|...Maiden's often deft blend of Rush-like concept songs with Zeppelin's hardest edge is no better illustrated than on this album and on the final track. While &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; is not even remotely in the same league as Rush's magisterial interpretation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's &quot;Xanadu,&quot; it's still a great song, with Bruce Dickenson's voice rising to the best performance of his career; the eerie feeling of the poem is also captured in the music. No other &quot;metal&quot; song of that era, excepting &quot;Damage Inc&quot; and &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; even comes close.      While it goes without saying the Maiden's musicianship never rises to the level of the boys from Toronto, it was head and shoulders above their &quot;metal&quot; contemporaries, excepting Metallica only. Maiden also valued production--and not just as cover for a Dokken-like lack of talent--and they are consistently high throughout this album and their Eighties' output.      Dickenson's vocals occasionally overreach his range, but this is probably a matter of taste. He certainly handles the given material well, with an energy and confidence a make-up'd and permed nitwit lip-synching to tapes because his band sucks so bad could never feel.      This is the REAL intro the best of what we might call &quot;progressive&quot; metal, as opposed to Metallica's distinct &quot;speed metal&quot; sound (one of the funnier memories I have of the 80's was stoned boneheads debating the exact definitions of &quot;death metal&quot; and &quot;speed metal&quot; and &quot;Satanic Metal&quot; (&quot;Storm Troopers of Death&quot; anyone? Their classic, &quot;Speak English or Die&quot;?) and the fifty other kinds of metal the loadies distinguished and I can't remember; if you're between 30 and 35 you should know exactly what I mean).      Dickenson & crew were at least consistent on those 80's albums. I was never a big metal fan, but I knew I wouldn't be cringing when somebody popped in a casette (for the younger crowd, that's those small rectangles your parents have stored in the attic on top of that box where you stashed the Playboys) of Maiden.      Ahhh, the memories it brings of the days when MTV played videos and mostly Rush, Maiden, Crue, etc. Before the Simon Cowells of the world utterly destroyed music. Before the corporate machine made sure that only their manufactured puppets would get deals. (&quot;And the words of the profits were written studio walls/Concert halls&quot;!)       How many great bands out their simply gave up because they weren't pretty enough or &quot;telegenic&quot; and, gasp, actually wanted to play their own material instead of the crap coming out of schlock factories like Cowell's employer, 19 Records or the cookie cutter trash Lou Pearlman has spread.      Let this older, but not old, album transport you to the days when musicianship mattered more than looks and songs were written as art or just to rock--not focus-grouped, polled and audience tested until they are as insipid as Tiffany--in other words, REAL music!
1920769005|5.0|Others have written it more concisely than I can, but to repeat: this is a very exciting, engaging and deeply moving book. It covers the depth of real, pure friendships, devotion and sincerity. As well as plenty of danger, laughter and tragedy. It's an honest journey of discovery and adventure. Roberts remains true to himself. He certainly has lived a very full life and makes me wonder just what I'm doing. <br />I couldn't put the book down and still rate it as the best I've ever read.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite movies ever. I won't go on about how great it is here, cause enough people have done that! The reason I gave it only 4 stars was because I was a little disappointed that the DVD didn't have more special features.

Oh well!    (...)
B00007JVBI|3.0|Many consider that art and on further analysis music is the ultimate expression of one's soul and heart and for that reason alone , no other has the right to judge it . In modern music reality though , where sales are often considered more important not only by record labels but by the artists themeselfs , cd releases can and should be subjected to fair critisism . Cat Power's \\" You're Free \\" though sounds so personal in parts that it feels unfair to reject it .      The key element behind it's magic is Chan Marshall's voice . It's difficult to actually explain the whole experience with words . It's just something so intimate , like your best friend calling in tears asking you to ...well , listen . As a songwritter though , she still has a big road ahead of her . Her short guitar and pianno themes repeat themselfs over and over and in many cases ( \\" Evolution \\" , \\" Maybe Not \\" ) the result would almost be irritating if it wasn't for her fragile perfomances combined with the most haunting backing vocals i ever heard in my life . Only the sweet panic of \\" He War \\" seems to have legs of it's own .      In concusion , Cat Power is undeniably a gifted artist . She can sing about a cake recipe and make it sound the most heartfelt thing ever recorded . Her presence in today's female music scene is surely interesting . Still , with some stronger , more complex melodies in the future she could make miracles happen .
6305280762|5.0|Towering Inferno is one of the top two of the seventies cycle of disaster films (the other, of course, being the Poseidon Adventure) and, by all reckoning, it probably should have been a big a disaster (pardon the expression) cinematically as Earthquake or The Swarm.  There is the faded star Love Boat-style in the casting, particularly with Jennifer Jones and Fred Astaire, although with better than average choices in still-hot stars, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, and an underused Faye Dunaway, and odd guest stars such as O.J. Simpson and Bobby Brady of the Brady Bunch.  But it always manages to feel better than the sum of its disparate parts.  Sadly, 9-11 itself adds an element of terror to the film from the moment Robert Wagner falls flaming from the building to Steve McQueen's final line.  But even without those potent resonances, the movie is quite gripping as it often rises above its cliche-ridden script.  A interesting and exciting example of a certain style of popular seventies cinema.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay released one of their very best albums with &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head.&quot; the mellow sounds we have come to love when listening to Coldplay are once again present in this modern musical masterpiece. <br />  <br /> I also recommend Coldplay's other albums and their new single, as well.
0553382179|5.0|I haven't actually purchased this book yet, but I have been following the program via the emails and on the web, and I really, really like it. I will purchase the book after I finish some other ones I'm working on.  <br />  <br /> I know why Marla's program works for me -- because I am a perpetually distracted type who NEEDS someone to remind me to so something like put my shoes away, at least until it becomes a habit. In fact, I was so enthused about the program that I told a friend about it and mentioned the shoe reminder emails as an example. My friend, who I suspect is an &quot;NO&quot; (Naturally Organized) person, looked at me and said, &quot;That is weird.&quot; Is my friend a mean person who looks down on others? No. She just doesn't get it because she doesn't NEED it.  <br />  <br /> So maybe that can be a simple test for whether this book is for you. Do you think someone getting an e-mail reminder to take note of where they have left their shoes or that they should try to leave their sink clean is weird? Can you not possibly imagine WHY someone would need that? If so, you may be an &quot;NO&quot; that only needs specific information on how to make your already tidy life even more tidy and this book/program might only annoy you. Be thankful for your gift, and don't be critical. Remember, alot of people who battle with distraction are also gifted with extra ordinary creative and inventive abilities.  <br />  <br /> And by the way, if you really don't like some aspect of Marla's program, don't do it. You're an adult. Do you do everything the way your mother thinks you ought to? Probably not, but hopefully you don't hate your mother for continually making the suggestion -- you just ignore it, and be thankful for the things she taught you that do work for you. I don't &quot;dress to the shoes&quot; the minute I get up as Marla would like -- I have my first cup of coffee before I dress, and plan on continuing to do so on into infinity, even if I get scolded by Marla. That is my time for meditation, reflection and cozy talks with my husband -- I don't WANT to be ready to get to work right then. But I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater -- I need the &quot;nagging&quot; Marla provides for me in other ways, and I'm grateful to her for it.  <br />  <br /> If you can relate to my experience, than this book/program may be one of the best things you have ever done for yourself.
B000002LMK|5.0|I am fairly new as a Young convert and have been buying all of his records that seem to be well received by critics and fans.  I think I am up to about 10 so far, grabbing a few from each decade.  I would have to say that this disc is the one that seems to hold my attention the best and longest.  The songs are very strong-- lyrically, musically, and melodically.  I don't really get the 'garage' tag that gets pinned on this record since the musicianship seems pretty strong and the songs very well-written.  The overall sound of the record is loose, almost live sounding.  This plays to Young's strengths--free-wheeling, passionate, and powerful. I would think that any new convert to Young's music (such as me) would be well served to pick up this record along side Live Rust,Harvest, Zuma, and Harvest Moon.

B000002OG5|5.0|It sounds more than logic to assume that if The Godfather is a masterpiece of the cinema and this music was another distingued actor ; you should have this CD . Superb sound and the music still retains that fascinating charm.
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush are the kings of their own game, they pretty much nailed what progressive rock was to be all about. &quot;2112&quot; and &quot;Farewell to Kings&quot; were two albums with constructive themes the band played accordingly to and succeeded. And I love both of those albums dearly; quite honestly I love every bit of Rushs' music, even &quot;Vapor Trails&quot;. I must enunciate that &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; is Rushs' finest hour or at least their most accessible work of art. <br />  <br /> &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; as well all know it, is one of the bands' breakthrough hits, a song centered around modern man and their modern train of thought. With some of the best guitar riffs ever accompanied with amazing keyboards, this song is one of the moments when Rush just spill out everything they stand for. &quot;Red Barchetta&quot; and especially &quot;YYZ&quot; showcase the bands' adventurous side, really I think the drumming of the proffessor, Neil Pert in &quot;YYZ&quot; is some of the best I've ever heard. <br />  <br /> &quot;Limelight&quot;, the moment of truth when the band talks about their run in the light or on stage, is still one of my favorite songs ever. Geddy Lee, Neil Pert and Alex Lifeson are the trio that compose this band and all three play their parts really well and on key, every second of this CDs' length. Enclosing with this, I'll say that Rush, even after 30 years worth of music are still one of the premiere bands in the world.
B0002HTZJI|4.0|When I heard that RHCP were releasing a live cd I knew I had to have it.  But this isn't just a live show, it's a masterpiece.  All of the songs we know and love from By the Way and Californiacation are there, plus a few old favorites like Under the Bridge and Give it Away.  Each song sounds brand new live with all of the improv base lines and guitar riffs that it's a whole new RHCP listen.  The new songs Rolling Sly Stone, Mini-Epic, and Leverage of Space are all great.  The only reason I gave this cd a 4 out of 5 is because the cover songs on the cd are all kind of lame in my opinion.  Overall, if you're looking for a great live cd of a great band, there is nothing better than Live in Hyde Park.
B00005JMEW|5.0|&quot;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&quot; <br />  <br /> Quentin Tarantino's fourth film and the first one since 1997's Jackie Brown takes the theme of revenge like Hamlet on steroids. It has not been an easy road for this generation's &quot;It&quot; director. Tarantino once worked at a video rental store before writing the script for Reservoir Dogs that he later directed. It was his directorial effort in 1994's Pulp Fiction that catapulted Tarantino, as well as the independent film company Miramax, into the Hollywood mainstream. Unfortunately his next film, Jackie Brown, which, by the way, was not written by him, was not widely accepted and then Quentin Tarantino dropped off the scene for nearly six years. In that time period he took time off to act in some films but, for the most part, the idea for Kill Bill had been bouncing around in his skull. Now that idea has burst out of that skull in all its blood spewing, gut splattering glory reuniting Pulp Fiction star, Uma Thurman, with the acclaimed cult director in a film series that pays homage to the 70's karate films that many us grew up with. <br />  <br /> The story centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fianc, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins. They better watch out because here comes the bride! The story for Kill Bill (Volume I) is probably one of the best scripts of the year despite being only half of the true plot. In a wonderful bit of technique, Tarantino starts the film off in the middle of story then backtracks to the events that start the chain reaction of revenge. He then flashes backwards and forwards in several instances that offer the best insight into the characters the audience is about to encounter. This gives better meaning to most of the fight sequences that take place in the course of the two hour feature. <br />  <br /> A relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film. Uma Thurman, who starred in Quentin Tarantino's breakout film, Pulp Fiction, once again works her magic for the talented director in probably her best film performance. Thurman gives a witty and exhilarating go around with her role as The Bride seeking revenge against her former colleagues. She presents a style to the character that makes you clamor for her all the way to the shocking break point. Lucy Liu has another kick-ass character performance as O-Ren Ishi, the leader of a group of Japanese assassins. The only problem with this role is that it makes Liu feel type-casted into this sort of character. Not that she bad at it, she's extremely effective in her performance, but you get the feeling that eventually she may get bored with these roles but if it works for her then ignore this comment. Vivica A. Fox doesn't really get to show much acting ability as her character is killed off in the first fifteen minutes of the film but what she does show is her amazing fighting moves, which is the only evidence needed to prove her worth in the film. This is only a small portion of the full cast, the rest of which will appear in Kill Bill (Volume II) coming February 20th. <br />  <br /> Overall, Kill Bill (Volume I) is a wonderful kick-off point for Quentin Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction, despite only being half of the entire feature. Though that being said, there are a couple of things to pick at including the well-choreographed action sequences. It wasn't exactly the sequences themselves but the rather large amount of blood and gut spilling that occurred during them that had more then one person squirming in their seats. Granted having your arm or leg cut off results in a large amount of blood loss but does that blood spew out like a fountain? The campy style of violence that occurs in Kill Bill (Volume I) may seem disturbing as the feature starts off but by the end, it doesn't seem so unnatural, which says something our culture's customization to violence and bloodshed in films. The pacing of the feature seemed well balanced but definitely dragged near the end as the film wrapped in a spin-chilling conclusion for the time being. But other then those small squabbles, Quentin Tarantino gives an eerie insight into what the concept of revenge does to the human psyche and what it could potential lead people to do if not controlled. It is said in the film, revenge is like a forest. Men (and women) can easily be lost in it and lose track of where they started or where they were going, so caution must be taken when start off on this path. The famous cult director starts off with accelerating beginning; let's hope he can deliver on what the chilling twist promises.  <br />
B00005U8EM|5.0|A bitter, sarcastic and egotistical weatherman discovers that he has a heart after being forced to relive Groundhog Day again and again and again... <br /> <br />Played by the marvelous Bill Murray, Phil the weatherman is the only one who realizes that there's a time loop, and it's great entertainment to see all the things he does in his new situation.  At first he thinks he's going insane.  After that, he decides to have a little fun, committing crimes and seducing women because he knows there will be no repercussions.  But then depression sets in as he realizes that he's in love with the producer of his show, there's no way to spend 24 hours convincing her that he's a good person, and that he's stuck in a personal hell... <br /> <br />Groundhog Day is a superb comedy, and also achieves moments of real depth - the psychology of someone stuck in such a situation is nicely explored.  This is one of Bill Murray's best movies, where he's given great material to work with and really shines (I love how he can say awfully sarcastic things without batting an eyelash...  and I love how he can manage to be truly romantic without being sappy, either).
B00006879E|5.0|Wow, Maroon 5 is the grooviest and funkiest band on the planet. I would have never really guessed by some of the stuff I saw on MTV. And I'm actually surprised that they didn't really pitch them to an urban audience. This CD is almost more Funk/Jazz/R&B than Pop. This band could school the best of them. They know their instruments well, proficient beyond words. I just got this from the store yesterday and the cashier said she loved this album, and now I know why. They should have won Album of the Year at the Grammys. I would highly recommend this CD.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't think this movie was predictable at all. I also thought it was really scary--I jumped a lot of parts, and even screamed, even though I was with a bunch of my friends and we were watching it in the daytime! <br /> <br />This movie stars Halle Berry (who I think did a great job at acting), who is Miranda, a psychologist at an institution for the insane. One night she is driving home from work, when she sees a mysterious girl burst into flames. Before she knows it, Miranda is waking up in the institution she works at...except that now, she's a patient. Then she is told that she killed her own husband, but she doesn't remember a thing. <br /> <br />Gothika is a suspenseful, and sometimes creepy, movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
B000002UAU|4.0|As I write this review I'm listening to this album and wondering why it always scores so damn high on the best albums list and I realize it's not the fact that it was so good, it's the fact that it WAS made and could BE made. Nothing like it had really been done before. But an album like this presents a problem: the highs are high and the lows are looooo[...] <br />  <br /> Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (8/10) This really isn't much of a song as it is an introduction, but I love how it gives off the &quot;live&quot; feel. very upbeat like most opening songs on their albums. <br />  <br /> With A Little Help From My Friends (7/10) A good little sing-along tune, nothing revolutionary,and Ringo sings. but it's still a classic. <br />  <br /> Lucy in The Sky With Diamonds (8/10) One of Johns more psychadelic songs. Great imagery throughout the lyrics, but his voice is too high throughout most of it. <br />  <br /> Getting Better (7/10) An optimistic little song. I can get into it and I like the defiant lyrics, But really not a highlight of the album. <br />  <br /> Fixing A Hole (5/10)I've never liked this song at all,it's a typical bad Paul song. Alot of the songs after this one seem to be throwaways. <br />  <br /> She's Leaving Home (6/10) Doesn't have that special something that most Beatle love songs have. The lyrics are alright, but they could have been set to the music better. <br />  <br /> Being For The Benifit of Mr. Kite (9/10) I think They did a great job of catching the whole circus atmosphere in this one. I love this song for it's fun lyrics also. <br />  <br /> Within You, Without You (6/10) I love the fact that The Beatles often incorporated Indian music into their recordings, but this isn't one of their best outings in that field. <br />  <br /> When I'm Sixty Four (9/10) I LOVE this song, I don't know why but I do. <br />  <br /> Lovely Rita (4/10) I hate this song! It has annoying melodies at the beggining and it sounds so friggin' pretentious.<br />  <br /> Good Morning, Good Morning. (2/10) My least favorite Beatles song next to Blue Jay Way. Have a listen and you'll know why. <br />  <br /> Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (9/10) even better than the one at the beggining, has a faster tempo and sounds better. (&quot;Were Sgt. Peppers one and only Lonely hearts Club Band!) <br />  <br /> A Day in The Life (10/10) A lot of people consider this song a masterpeice, while I wouldn't be quick to do that I do think it is the best song on the album, I love how paul's part fit's in so well although it is totally different. <br />  <br /> Anyway, you shuld probably pick this one up considering that bad Beatles songs are often better than some bands BEST songs, so if you want something different be sure to grab it. <br />
1400034779|4.0|This was a wonderful book. I don't know why I had hesitations about reading it. I read it and I was well-rewarded. <br /> <br />         Precious is your average African female.

I really couldn't <br />put this book down I absolutely loved it. <br />            The book did have many African words I didn't know, and I never found out what they meant, and I ended up referring to people as Mma R or Dr.K,etc. because I just couldn't pronounce their last names.  <br /> <br />             Other than that it was a wonderful book, and I give it 4 stars:)
B00005JKQZ|3.0|<br /> <br />A Beautiful Mind is an enjoyable movie, mainly because of Russell Crowe's performance as the schizophrenic mathematician, John Nash.  Crowe really throws himself into the role, acting out the despair, the awkwardness, and the blunt humor of the genius very well. <br /> <br />The film does iron out a lot of the complexities of Nash's life, though.  It's almost as if the director was too afraid of showing schizophrenia in all its messiness; this is a cleaned up version.  As a result, the characters take a very predictable, carefully scripted course in their reactions to the problem.  The psychology is as simple as that of a made-for-T.V. movie. <br /> <br />Still, it's an engaging movie, filmed beautifully with a well-chosen cast.  The DVD also has some bonus scenes worth watching, the funniest being one where John and his future wife Alicia deter the advances of a smug man who wants Alicia's attention.
B00006879E|5.0|This CD is wonderful!  I put it into my car a few months ago and while I enjoyed it, at first I wasn't too into it.  Then, as I was driving I couldn't change discs and so it started over again.  And again.  And again.  I think this CD has left my car 3 times in the last 3 months, and never for very long.  I saw them live a couple weeks ago and was absolutely blown away.  Total rock stars!  My favorite new band!  Favorite tracks include the 3 currently played on the radio (Harder to Breathe, This Love, She Will Be Loved), although I think there are others that are better than This Love.  The Sun is great, and one I keep coming back to is Sunday Morning.  I also really like Through With You.  When in the car I literally just skip to whatever one I feel like hearing at the moment, but when I think about it they really all get about equal airplay because they are all so good!  Bottom line:  BUY THIS CD!!!!  And see them live!!!!
B000063DI9|5.0|Personally, I thought that Powerslave and Somewhere in Time were both a step down from their previous 3 efforts.(though they were still very good) With 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son(hereafter referred to as Seventh Son, if necessary) they got fully back on track with another all time masterpiece to stand alongside Piece of Mind and Number of the Beast.<br /><br />Contrary to what many say, Maiden has changes a fair bit over the years.  This is a bit lighter than their earlier material, with some tastefully used synths and a more natural guitar tone than on Somewhere in Time, but one that still thinner than they had on their prime era material(It's still a bit buzzy and trebly)  Stylistically, this is closer to 80's hair metal bands than they were before, and perhaps a bit closer than I'd like, but in the end this just illustrates that the most important difference between IM and the hair bands was that IM had talent, which shines through regardless of some fairly superficial tonal changes.(That and it still maintains a reasonable complexity and it never to pandering in it's attempts at commercial appeal.) They're all fabulous instrumentalists here, as always, with great melodic solos and licks, and lots of pulsing, energetic basslines.(Though the solos don't stand out as much as usual, the riffs and licks are probably even better.)  Nicko has always been an unsung hero, and while he doesn't stand out like the others he's got tons of power and energy and drives them well.  Dickinson is great too. The voice of classic metal for sure.  A little cheesy I guess, but IM can do cheesy very well.<br /><br />This album doesn't have as much variety as Number of Piece, which holds it back slightly, but its remarkably consistent.  Moonchild is a simply awesome opener.  Instantly memorable chorus and boundless energy. Infinte Dreams is a great ballad, but not very commercial as such, and fairly unconventional.  Lots of great guitar melodies in that one and effective synths.  Can I Play with Madness is cheesy, repetitive, mainstream and very good.  It's impossibly catchy and fun with some very nice drum work from Nicko.  The Evil that Men Do is similarly catchy, but darker and more mournful, with one of their best licks ever.(It's probably even better)  The title track is another true standout.  An absolute epic, with some great wordless vox from Dickinson after the chorus and a fine use of synths.  The instrumental sections all slay as well.  The album falters a bit in the last three tracks.  The Clairvoyant is quite excellent, particularly the vocals again, but the other 2 don't stand out as much.  Good songs, but nothing terribly different or exciting about them..<br /><br />All IM fans must own this.  If your not an IM fan, Number of the Beast is a better start, but this ain't a bad choice either.synths.  Can I Play with Madness is cheesy, repetitive, mainstream and very good.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|this album is very good. it dosent blow you brains out every song but to me and a lot of others thats a good thing. There are some really heavy songs and others where Corey does this miraculous thing called &quot;SINGING&quot; its truely incredible. Its cool when they go sick but c'mon every song can't be like that. If you have any taste in music you would like this album.
B000002KB8|4.0|During a time of &quot;peace and love music&quot; came a band called Black Sabbath, Hailing from the town of Aspen Burmingham, A steel town bombed out and dominated by poor wages and horrible jobs. It was the hard life that enspired them to write something That didn't drone on about &quot;pretty girls, or world peace&quot; but instead War, Violence, and Drug Addiction, Amongst many other taboo subjects. It was this that built and enspired Heavy Metal. It all began with Black Sabbath's Debut self titled album. I can still vividly remember the first time a listened to it. I remember listening to the first song thinking &quot;this is the most evil thing i have ever heard&quot; I was hooked from that point on. The Wizard took me by a little bit of a surpise when I heard the harmonica in it, but I quickly warmed up to that and really started to like the track, especially the guitar riff. N.I.B. and Wicked World, quickly became two of my favorite Sabbath Tracks, and although the final track is a little long for my liking it's still pretty cool. This album is a true classic, and as good then as it is now. You can't call yourself a Metal fan without respect for this album.
6305807930|5.0|Considering that Suspiria is by far the most popular and acclaimed film in Argento's catalogue I'm rather confused as to why the sequel Inferno isn't more popular.  Fans of Suspiria, like myself, ought to eat this up. Admittedly, it isn't as good as Suspiria, but it takes all the things that made that film so extraordinary and unusual and pushes them boundaries even further, while managing to be a fairly distinct from it's predecessor. This is most definitely a worthwhile piece in and of itself, and it is a must see for any horror fan, or those who enjoy visually startling films.<br /><br />Visually, Inferno is even more stylized then Suspiria, with virtually nothing being shot in a perfuntory or realistic manner. It takes the most prominent visual aspect of Suspiria, the bright, garish sets and surreal colored lighting,(most often red and blue) and takes them to a greater extreme, and in a slightly different direction.  In Suspiria, the set design and colored lighting were relatively simple, generally using open areas and relatively simple lighting, frequently with the entire scenes bathed in a single color.(And it rarely become more complicated than simply having 2 colors for the background, and 1 more illuminating the characters in the foreground) Thus, for all it's eeriness, the lighting in Suspiria actually illuminated the scene quite well. Not so in Inferno.  The sets are cramped and elaborate, with numerous different light sources illuminating small portions of the scenes, generally with much of the scene still shrouded in darkness.(often to the point which you can't easily identify objects)  Thus, although Inferno has many of the visual elements of Suspiria, they are used in a notably different style. Personally, I think that Inferno looks even better then its predecessor. The most notable scene, visually, is when Rose is attacked in her apartment.  It is simply astounding.<br /><br />This film is not big on plot or character development. In fact, I would say that it has perhaps the least character development of any film I've seen. (none) And to my surprise, I think this is actually a slight problem. Although Suspiria wasn't too big on character development, it managed to make me genuinely like Suzy and Sarah, whereas I don't give a damn about anyone in this film. And this actually makes the horror scenes less effective. The plot extends the mythos of Suspiria, with Rose reading a book, The Three Mothers, in the opening scene. The book states that 3 sisters rule the world, Mater Suspiriorum, Mater Tenebrarum and Mater Lachymarum, and that they live in Freiburg, Rome and New York respectively.(Naturally, Mater Suspiriorum was Helena Marcos in Suspiria)  And she discovers that, wouldn't ya know it, she's living in the apartment complex in which Mater Tenebrarum resides.(She lives underneath it though, not in one of the apartments.) She's disturbed by this story and calls for help from her brother, Mark, living in Rome. Thus, an investigation is begun by various individuals, generally leading to their untimely deaths. As you might imagine, the plot is driven by absurdities and contrivances almost exclusively. But I don't care, and neither should you, considering the film and its goals.  It can be a bit confusing at times as well, but you ought not worry about that, for the reasons stated above.<br /><br />The murder sequences are very elaborate and nicely done, in much the same magnificently colored and hallucinogenic slasher film manner found in Suspiria, this time generally with taloned, cowled killers.  They do have some slight flaws, however. Most significantly, they lack much of the sheer intensity and brutality of the killings in Suspiria. (Sorry about the endless comparisons, but they practically beg to be done) Simply put, the victims in Inferno are, for the most part, not made to suffer the way they did in Suspiria.  Some people found the more sadistic aspect of Suspiria offensive, but that's what gave the deaths there power.  Naturally, the most affecting death is the most painful seeming one, where the victim has their head pinned down through an open window, and the broken window pane repeatedly dropped on their throat.  The visualization of this event leaves something to be desired, but it is conceptually nasty enough to make it work very well. Still, all the other deaths are beautifully shot and staged, even if they aren't as painful or personally affecting. Another problem is that they attempt a few more animal attacks, with little success.  There is a cat attack, which is unintentionally humorous, and a massed rat attack which is just kinda bland. Fortunately, that is not all that is going on in those scenes, and they are still excellent sequences overall.<br /><br />One of the most famous aspects of Suspiria was its extraordinary score by the band Goblin.  Here Keith Emerson takes over scoring duties, and takes them in a different, somewhat more conventional direction, with lots of omionous, discordant piano pieces.  Though not as effective as Goblin's work, it still works quite well, and is preferable to merely attempting a retread of the previous score. It uses the old trick of having a vicious murder contrasted with a grandiose, incongruent classical piece,(to great effect) and I also particularly enjoy the rock version of some Verdi piece they use during the cab scene.(It's cheesy, but I like it)<br /><br />Sadly, the end of this film is somewhat anti-climatic.(Though to a lesser extent than was Suspiria)  It's primarily hurt by the fact that it has a conceptually solid but incredibly hokey visual effect during the confrontation with Mater Tenebrarum. It's also hurt by the fact that the evil is defeated not by the actions of any of the protagonists, but just through luck and chance.<br /><br />Well, that's about it. Somewhat flawed, but the flaws don't matter much.  If you haven't seen Suspiria yet, see it first. If you like that, check this out.e deaths there power.

B00005JN2F|4.0|Cool, confident, professional, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; cements the franchise as the intellectual alternative to the now goofy, effects-dripping James Bond series. Immersed in the spy world without posting blinking signs to the genre - minimum gadgetry - the movie is a brisk, excellent global tour of international politics.  <br />  <br /> In Matt Damon, the series, mined from Robert Ludlum's novels, has a man of everyday, blockheaded features capable of physical extremes; this is not Tom Cruise tossing back his hair, suspended in vanity from a rock. There is moment when Jason Bourne, in mourning, looks pinched and ugly, an excellent capture of sadness. Bourne barely breathes in this movie, and he doesn't speak much more. Waste in not in his vocab, nor the film's. <br />  <br /> Still haunted by memories of the mission that helped trigger his amnesia in &quot;Identity,&quot; the first film, Bourne has found a ocean hideout in Goa, India with girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente). Across the world, in Berlin, Bourne is being framed for two murders in a CIA sting gone bad. Soon after, a Russian assassin (Karl Urban, excellent if virtually silent) is after Bourne and Marie, who is killed after a car accident on a bridge. Bourne is then onto Naples, Italy, where he must reenter the CIA grid as deputy directors Pamela Lundy (Joan Allen) and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) wait to descend. Both want Bourne. Lundy prefers him alive; Abbott pushes for death. Bourne seeks his framers and the source of his dreams. It leads to Room 645 in a Berlin hotel.  <br />  <br /> As a young colleague (Julia Stiles, in garish highlights) puts it, Bourne doesn't make mistakes, he makes moves, drawing the crosshairs closer, the better to learn his captors motives. He lands in three major jams, the last pitting him against that Russian assassin, every bit Bourne's equal, in a Moscow tunnel. Staged by director Paul Greengrass, these public chases are feats of speed and editing, daring enough toadmire Bourne's considerable spy skills while still this side of believable - Damon sustains a limp after landing hard on a barge. As in the first movie, boxy European four-doors are the vehicles of choice as Bourne evades his captors - slow, yet seeming to endure almost endless structual damage, they are mechanical companions to Bourne. Functional, indestructible. <br />  <br /> Joan Allen, glaring soft like steel wool, is perfectly cast as CIA ice queen Lundy - by-the-book and clever, but not Jason Bourne clever. But Cox, as Abbott, is hamstrung by the red arrow pointing at his character. Tony Gilroy returns for the screenplay, and it is again literate, hushed and direct, proving that stories absent of joy - gray skies abound, and Moscow simply doesn't play host to happiness - still entertain through the force of their intelligent gambits. Whereas the Jack Ryan series got caught up with the pedestrian manliness of Harrison Ford, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is content to keep working the angles, the reward being a night of sleep, or a simple, overdue apology. It's spy food for those with perspective.
B00023B1LC|4.0|&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; takes the premise from the marvelous novel by Robert Ludlum and adds a distinctive modern film twist to it. In many respects, Bourne (Matt Damon)is the anti-Bond; he begins as an assassin but, robbed of his memory and hunted because of an assassination he failed to carry out, Bourne tries to stay alive as other assassins are sent to eliminate him. In the meantime, he tries to discover who he is and why they're trying to kill him. He meets Marie (Franka Potenta from &quot;Run, Lola, Run&quot;)and forces her to drive him to the apartment where he lived. While she's frightened, she's drawn to this mysterious and hurt soul.<br /><br /> Director Doug Liman (&quot;Go&quot;) and screenwriters Tony Gilroy (&quot;Proof of Life&quot;, &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;) & W. Blake Herron (the forthcoming &quot;Mr. Ripley's Return&quot;) have fashioned a marvelous spy thriller with a number of marvelous set pieces including the infamous carchase with the minis. Visually striking with strong performances by tne entire cast, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is a great way to spent an evening.<br /><br /> I wouldn't, however, recommend the re-release unless you haven't purchased the film previously. The alternate opening isn't quite finished and the alternate ending was available on the previous version on DVD. The biggest drawback, though, is the fact that this edition doesn't have an audio commentary track by director Liman. While there are a number of extras (they are highlighted in the amazon.com list of new features) here that are new, this really isn't all that different from the previous version. If you haven't seen the movie yet, this edition does have a free &quot;ticket&quot; to the sequel so that might entice someone who has rented but not purchased the movie before to get this. Having seen both editions, the transfer appears to be the exact same digital transfer from last year.<br /><br /> A great spy thriller of the type Hitchcock might have made if he were 35 years old and just starting out making movies, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is well worth purchasing but if you bought it before you may want to seriously reconsider getting this edition.ck might have made if he were 35 years old and just starting out making movies, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is well worth purchasing but if you bought it before you may want to seriously reconsider getting this edition.
B000068TPN|5.0|Too often Hollywood says they are going to make a movie thats &quot;real&quot; and end up making a Special Effects display to rival the 4th of July.  <br />  <br /> Not this time. As Col. Moore says in the special features - &quot;Someone finaly got it Right&quot; <br />  <br /> This movie relies more on the story and the ability of its actors to convey human emotion on all sides, U.S., the wives, even the North Vietnamese, than special effects.  <br />  <br /> They do a marvelous job, expecially Gibson and Pepper. Just as in Saving Private Ryan, alot of the emotion is related through the actors' eyes. You see the madness of war and the sheer joy of coming home...just by looking into the eyes. <br />  <br /> Simply Amazing.  <br />  <br /> Anyone who knocks this film for its realism has no idea what they are talking about. Remember this, all the things that happened in this movie...happened in 3 DAYS. Imagine being &quot;on&quot; for months at a time....no civilian can. I can't imagine living through it either, and so I pay homage to those who fought. To all our vets i say thank you.
0142001104|4.0|I experienced Benjamin Zander doing a presentation at a conference a few years ago, and though some of his activities were not my cup of tea, the power of his ideas and more importantly his energy was effective.  While the book is not as good as the real thing, it is a lot easier to access! <br /> <br />Certainly there are many books of this type, but the message that we become what we think is such a critical message that it needs repeating and reinforcement from a variety of voices.
B00005JNA2|5.0|It is a pity that the name 'The Conversation' was already bestowed upon a film, because that is what 'Before Sunset' is, essentially: it is a conversation that draws from life experience and a romantically important night the two people, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), had in Vienna nine years prior to the reunion taking place within this sequel to Linklater's last conversation-based film with the same characters...nine years ago, actually. It is a real-time conversation and is at times romantic, dark, hilarious and exciting, and not at all pretentious. In fact, it is quite realistic. The two talk about love and everything that surrounds its existence, if true love exists at all. They speak of past lovers, current romantic situations and dwell on the what-ifs of their own. Though it has no traditional plotting, there is a conversational, heart-breaking climax between the two that leaves you amazed by its authenticity. Overall, the conversation is well-rounded, well-grounded, insightful and perfectly written. Among other things, the actors' breathtaking realism only underscores the profundities of their words. Both were amazing, but it is Julie Delpy that struck me as best in show. It is a performance that is not to be missed in a film that is unforgettable, endearing and ultimately romantic in a way that is effective, not cheesy like most of the trash that comes our way.
B00003CXCT|5.0|OK, I am reading all these bad reviews because of the &quot;Special Editions&quot; are being used for the DVD's. Look I have seen every one of these films in the theater since I was 6 (1977). There is nothing wrong with any of these movies. Granted I do enjoy some more than others, but with Attack of the Clones and Im willing to bet Revenge of the Sith as well will make it into my top 3 favs in the series. That said, I have the VHS of the originals and the only thing that got changed that screwed up the movie a little is the Han Shot first scene. Other than that, the new effects are good and I dont have a problem with it. Granted I can now burn the originals on DVD from my Video tapes if I really want them that bad. But I can live with that one scene. Mr. Lucas is doing a fine job getting these out with good commentaries and tons of extras. Be happy, enjoy them as Lucas wants them seen, not as you all envision them. And I cannot wait until all of your prequel bashers see Revenge of the Sith and change your minds. May the Force be with all of you....
B0002234LS|4.0|&quot;Secret WIndow&quot; is a slight but entertaining little thriller best approached with lowered expectations. It's based on a Stephen King short story/novella, about a popular author accused of plagiarism by a murderous creep with an oily pallor and a dripping drawl. <br /> The single reason to see this film is to catch yet another delightful performance by Johnny Depp. This guy is truly amazing...his portrayals are full of details and quirks that flesh out the characters in ways other actors can't. They try, but they always look like they're trying. <br /> The supporting cast, Maria Bello, Timothy Hutton, Charles S. Dutton and a wicked John Turturro, are fine...but you really can't take your eyes off Depp. He clearly elevates the material. <br /> David Koepp's script makes the most out of a difficult adaptation, and his direction is unexpectedly impressive. Inventive but always servicing the story...it's the second best thing about the film. He sets the mood, keep the atmosphere tense, surprises you here and there... <br /> Give this film a chance, and you just might be pleasantly surprised.
B000008H1U|4.0|For a band that never seemed to hit its stride, this particular album stands out.  There is a bit of a Cold War theme to many of the tracks and the others all have relavance.  Other Tull recordings never seemed to get it together for an entire album, but Crest of a Knave hits the mark.  Like just about every other Tull recording, this one received minimal air play but that cannot be an indictment of the quality.  Ian Anderson seems to back off of his dictatorial leadership and let guitarist Martin Barre share the spotlight. <br /> <br />If anyone has never given Jethro Tull a serious look (or listen), this album might be among the best opportunities to get a flaavor of what the band is capable of.  Tull fans have already rang in with their endorsements of this effort.  There is a good flow to the songs and they compliment each other in their placement on the disc.
B000000OQF|5.0|I grew up with this album and it's in my top 5 ever.  In my words and in simplest of terms..............PURE ROCK AND ROLL.  A must for everyone.
B000002H33|2.0|What was good once usually becomes outdated after time. Such is the deal with Metallica. This album was good back then but now it's crap. It's just riff after riff. And whats more many people these days can play this stuff. If it was truly art, )which it is only considered by non-musicians and crappy musicians) then then it would be difficult. So as you all know Metallica are now sellouts and are fading from the metal scene. Good Riddance:) New bands like Blind Guardian (The gods of metal) simply put Metallica to shame. Its harder to play, Lyrics are more indepth, Drumming is 10x better. All of the people in Blind Guardian are 10x better then James, Kirk, Lars and which ever bassist you choose. There is really no comparison. And I know about real metal music and since you consider metallica to be the best, you obviously don't. So you should stay away from Blind Guardian because you don't deserve to listen to it.
B000002KGT|5.0|well, for starters--although this too has probably been said--_rumours_ is one of a relatively small number of true masterpieces in the genre of soft rock. it's simply the greatest softrock album of all time and one of the most successful albums of any genre, any decade. all the standard hits are here, &quot;don't stop,&quot; &quot;go your own way,&quot; &quot;the chain,&quot; and several others that aren't quite that popular. my favorite by leagues and leagues, however, is the tucked away acoustic number, &quot;never going back again,&quot; an absolutely lovely track. all the same, i think this album cowers and disappears when placed up against it's infinitely more ambitious sister album, _tusk_.
B000001GQT|5.0|After having consulted The Penguin Guide to Classical Music, I settled for these particular recordings (Amazon helped, too, in making up my mind as to what to buy). There are a lot of other choices available to prospective buyers/listeners, but the above mentioned reference work was in favor of this version of especially Also Sprach Zarathustra. <br /> <br />So I went for Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic. Personally I haven't got anything against Karajan, who is in my opinion simultaneously overrated and underrated (and hated, too) by some people. Karajan's approach to certain works of music is not always to my taste, to be honest; but here Karajan's vision and the Berlin Philharmonic's playing are at work to produce great music. <br /> <br />Besides Zarathustra you also get Don Juan, Eulenspiegel, and Dance of the Seven Veils. <br /> <br />Note: Of The Backworldsmen (part of Zarathustra) is incredibly powerful.
B00005JM02|5.0|What in the hell was that reviewer doing complaining about violence in this movie?  Have they even played a video game or watched their local news?  If they're referring to Nemo's mother getting killed, well, (1) you don't see anything graphic and (2) death is a part of life.  Anyways, Nemo is a great film, you should know that by now.  This dvd really is fantastic as well.  I highly recommend all of Pixar's movies (Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc.); they're just fabulous.  One last thought . . has anyone wondered what is UP with Disney nowadays?!  Brother Bear was pretty good, but if I hear about another sequel to some classic films . .
B00004Y2QT|5.0|I went to the Prince concert recently at MSG in NYC on the opening and closing night and was completely blown away by his exuberant performance. I wanted more of Prince live so I went searching on Amazon and read reviews then decided to purchase this and 2 other VHS (Sign O' The Times and Prince and the Revolution Live).  After seeing this I am really convinced this man is quite the Musical Genius, often imitated but never to be duplicated. I enjoyed Prince on this DVD to the utmost and it was like added bonus with the special guests he had especially Lenny Kravitz. This is the DVD to get, it's like going to another live Prince concert in the privacy of your own home. It's true there is only one Prince!
B00009RAJJ|5.0|_tusk_ is fleetwood mac's _white album_, and that pretty much says it all. this was lindsey buckingham's project, and his tendency for weirdness is exactly what this band needed. interestingly, the album follows a kind of alternating weird-song-easy-song format that somehow makes the easy songs weird and the weird songs even weirder. great piece of work, here. criminally overlooked.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I truly and honestly think that anyone who doesn't love this album is one of three things: one, following a trend of stupid critics; two, judging without listening; or three, deaf! This album is so great! As an album on the whole, I think it is much better than
0783229364|5.0|This movie is awesome, and there is no denying it.  It stars Michael J. Fox.  If that isn't enough to win you over, I'm not sure what will.  But I'd like to point out this movie's absolutely genius use of the classic 80's movie montage.  That's right!  MONTAGE!  New York City montage no less.  To the montage fans all over the world, this movie is the Citizen Kane of montages.  Brantley Foster is climbing the corporate ladder, not to mention the fact that he's LIVING 25 HOURS A DAY!  Oh, Carlton.....I mean Brantley.....you're my hero.
1401201911|4.0|This graphic novel is not a parody, it's an alternate history. A most unusual alt-history: an alternate to a fictional reality, rather than an alternate version of our history. (The most popular themes for alternate history are, What if the South won the Civil War?, and What if the Germans won WWII?)<br /><br />Alternate history is a concept generally more familiar to those who read SF novels rather than comics/graphic novels. Many of us SF novel readers did read a lot of comics when we were younger, though, and I think this particular graphic novel is aimed at us. We read Superman - and Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman - in the 50's, 60's and 70's. So, although we may not have read any other of this particular series of graphic novels, we have quite a bit of background in the Superman mythos - his real parents, where he grew up, girlfriends, enemies, etc.<br /><br />I think that knowing that background from the original comics may make this book more enjoyable to my middle-aged generation than to people who are used only to the graphic novels. As well, my generation had the advantage of living through most of the history that was really happening from 1950 on. For those who know the history of the Cold War only from school, many of the details wouldn't make sense. It helps a great deal in reading this book if you are familiar with the course of the Cold War, and that you know not only who JFK was, but some of the celebrity gossip about him as well as the official records. (The name Norma Jean should mean something to you.) You should know what the Warsaw Pact was, and something about in what order the Soviet Union took over various countries.<br /><br />I liked the way the book involved similar alternate twists on Batman, and brought in Wonder Woman and Green Lantern as well. Batman's hat is the funniest thing I've seen in a while!<br /><br />A couple quibbles: having the artwork done by more than one artist is distracting; a couple times it was hard to recognize Lois Lane as herself. And I do wish that illustrators would STOP trying to use the Cyrillic alphabet incorrectly. If you can't use the letters for what they really are, don't use them, please. The thing that looks like a backwards R is NOT an R. The letter that looks like a backwards N is NOT an N. So stop it already! Just go for English in the signs and titles, or for accurate Russian. (One illustrator did this correctly, but on many pages, and the cover art, these letters are used incorrectly.) OK, that's one of my pet peeves, since I happen to be able to read Russian a little; it may not bother other people as much as it bugs me.<br /><br />Summary?

B000002MM8|4.0|this is world music, plain and simple and leaning towards ambient. and the fact that any of these songs received airplay--track 2, &quot;the ubiquitous mr. lovegrove&quot; was a minor hit of sorts--is entirely unbelievable. this album came to me hidden by a few dozen others in a gigantic selection i bought for a paltry sum on ebay. it is wonderful night-time music, darkened-room music, sex music, winter music, etc, etc. the whole thing is so subtly crafted, the percussion always just right, the arrangements never overdone, the vocals never too dramatic. it's a very well done piece of music/work of art, and if you're into this sort of thing, you can't go wrong.

B000002HH2|4.0|most of you have probably had this album for a while now, and loved it for a little longer than that. it's superb, and groundbreaking, and accessible, and complex, and bizarre, and all the other titillating adjectives you hear people apply to bjork and her music. this, i think, may be her most enjoyable album, very cohesive and sturdy, with nary a weak link to be found. but then again, i haven't listened to all that much bjork in my lifetime. i've found that i take her best in smallish doses.
B0000640SA|5.0|Before you watch this film, to avoid being confused you have to realize that the whole movie is played out backwards. A certain scene will play until it reaches the starting point of the scene before it. Christopher Nolan used this technique to put the viewer into the same perspective as the protagonist. He suffers from a short term memory disorder that renders him incapable of making new memories past the point of his accident. During a robbery of his house, he sustained a serious head injury that messed up his memory. So he is trying to track down his wife's killer. However, it's very difficult for him to do because he can't remember new things that he's just discovered. To compensate for this, he has a series of tattoos with the certain facts that he has confirmed. He also takes pictures and makes notes to remember people or places that he's been to. The film is executed brilliantly and showcases the perfect actors. Guy Pearce stars as the protagonist, Leonard Shelby. And the film co-stars Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix, Red Planet) as Natalie, and Joe Pantoliano (Bad Boys II, The Fugitive) as Teddy. The film also has a terrific twist of an ending. 5 stars, one of my favorite films. <br /> <br />Sidenote: This DVD edition, the Limited Edition, has a very unique style to it. The special features are all easter eggs, as you are presented with a series of questions and then you have to answer them in the right order to reach certain supplements. It is an interesting approach to the new things you can do with the DVD format, but it can get frustrating at times. If you prefer a more straightforward DVD version, there is a single-disc edition available.
B000068FY1|4.0|although i've not heard much of the jayhawks' other output (i like what i've heard from their most recent LP, _rainy day music_), i believe it when critics say that they never topped this album. feel-good alt.country, plain and simple, from one of the genre's pioneers. &quot;wichita&quot; and &quot;take me with you (when you go)&quot; are both classics.
B000050FEN|5.0|Due to the brutal nature of the film Se7en, it is clear that it isn't for everyone. The ending caused a lot of controversy because there were a lot of people who hated it, but also a lot who thought that was the greatest ending the movie could have. Either way, this isn't a happy movie. It's about two detectives who follow the trail of a mysterious &quot;John Doe&quot; who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins. Disturbing and disgusting crime scenes are discovered throughout the movie as the detectives figure out John Doe's system. <br />  <br /> I loved this film. I thought although it was very disturbing at times, it is also very well done. David Fincher's dark film style really shows and benefits the film. The actors were perfectly cast, Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset, and Brad Pitt as detective Mills. <br />  <br /> I think that one will either love this film or hate it because of its brutal nature. Before one can judge it though, one must give it a fair chance. 5 stars, it's brutal, but it's good. <br />  <br /> Sidenote: This DVD edition provides considerably better audio and video quality than the single-disc release, and also includes four audio commentaries on it's first disc. On the second disc, there is a considerably large handful of extras to dig into, and they are both informative and fun to watch.
B00006F7S4|4.0|...this record has more review than any other record i've ever clicked on. that's just as well; _sea change_ is sublime, everything i wanted _mutations_ to be. i ended up disliking _mutations_ quite a lot--probably unfairly--and so went into this one expecting to be let down. it actually took me almost a year to listen to it, but when i did, i was way, way impressed. his 2nd or 3rd best album, i think. you know what it is? it's very pretty, that's what it is. did you know beck came out with a b-side compilation in 2000? i didn't; just found out. i wonder if it's any good?
B000002L9J|5.0|The &quot;Queen is Dead&quot; is my favorite album of all time, full of stark contrasts, cockiness, piercing vocals, and musical compositions that seemingly mock the morbid title name. &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot;.... much is often said about the title, the title sticks out, it surely a statement of extreme importance and sadness however Morissey expresses his cyncism AND his grief on this emotional record. It's easy to see why people hate the Smiths, dude to the pretentious nature of the lyrics, the repetitive beats, but all that is underrated and misdirected. What Morissey, the greatest and most important song writer of all time, has manifested throughout his career (thus reaching the zenith here) is a persona, that many a songrwiter has failed to produce. He defines himself through his pretntiousness and vanity (much so) and his sarcasm and lack of care towards importance issues. &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot;.... Morissey seems to state that while he comprehends the existence of this event is tragic, he lack a certain sympathy, thus implying he often forges what he feels, and he feels much regret for not becoming well... more caring.  <br /> I could sit here an analyze ach song, but that would take most of the fun away from the reader and listener. Two songs here are often listed as the greatest of the decade. Those are &quot;the boy with a thorn in his side&quot; and &quot;there is a light that never goes out&quot;, while I think &quot;I know its over&quot; contends very well with them, sometimes, I believe, better.  <br /> I can't really do much to say more about this record, but the one big thing I can say, are the Smiths aren't easy to like, and reward the observant and patient listener.
B000002AGN|5.0|quite possibly my favorite single jazz album, way up there with _kind of blue_ and the charlie parker compilation i have. in fact, i think i like it better than both of those. insane rhythms all the way through, and yet, somehow it sounds like the easiest music in the world. everything is so subtle, so comfortable, and that means you can listen hard and pick this album apart, you can barely listen at all (it's great background music), or you can kinda listen and just enjoy it for what it is: great jazz. <br />
0380789035|1.0|Having read several of the Sandman comics, I went into 'American Gods' expecting sharp, incisive wit or at least some degree of dark humor.  Sadly, this book delivered neither.  The central tenet of the story was interesting, but the basic plot device (i.e. gods mascarading as humans) seemed old after about 30 pages.  After that the book was just plain boring.  I agree with the other reviewers who said Neil Gaiman should stick to comics...
B000001FSR|4.0|i was a bit nervous about getting this one, worried that its foundation as a musical might make it a weak album. i was wrong, big time. i mean, this guy just won't stop exceeding my expectations. there are many great waits-moments on here, but the best, and now one of my favorite TW songs ever, is the sweetly haunting &quot;innocent when you dream&quot;. this album also flows seamlessly with its two predecessors, _swordfishtrombones_ and _rain dogs_.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|&quot;Oh, this is the start of something good. Don't you agree?&quot; Well, I certainly do. Gavin DeGraw's new 2 cd set Chariot Stripped is riveting. From &quot;Follow Throuh&quot; to the classic &quot;A Change is Gonna Come,&quot; Gavin's soulful voice will captivate you. His lyrics are raw and genuine, making a connection with the heart. This is a cd you will fall in love with; I know I did. I listen to Chariot Stripped every day, sometimes 3 and 4 times a day. Buy the cd. You won't regret it.
B00000255F|4.0|i honestly thought i would love this album, given that i hold dear the anthems &quot;born to run,&quot; and &quot;thunder road&quot;...but come to find out, this album is way too dominated by these two songs. the best track is, in fact, &quot;backstreets,&quot; but it hides behind the rock monstrosities surrounding it and hasn't gotten its due. there's also the slight uneasiness that emanates from bruce's sheer determination to become the biggest name in rock 'n' roll; it's as audible as the drums on this record. i much prefer the earlier albums, like _the wild, the innocent, and the e-street shuffle_, where the boss was more concerned with just rocking out than actually becoming &quot;the boss&quot;.
B000255LIY|5.0|I just finished watching this.  This is so much better than the 1968 movie.  Patrick and Glenn are much closer in age than the 1968 version.  Even though Henry was younger, he wasn't that much younger than Eleanor as portrayed in the 1968 version.  Both actors gave a 3D performance and their range and depth of character was incredible.  Patrick is a dynamic performer and Glenn was certainly up to the challange.  This performance is also complete.  The 1968 version is a scaled down version of the play. Both characters were much more in line with history.  My wife, a historian, is a direct descendant of Eleanor and Henry and this performance was indeed scrutinized.  If you want a classic, get the 1968 version.  If you want the real thing, get this one.  You won't be disappointed in the powerful performances of ALL of the actors.  It is a true emsemble of performers playing off of each other in an intense and rivoting way. This performance kept me on the edge of my chair continually.
B0000931OG|5.0|honestly? i can't for the life of me understand why opinions were so violently divided over this album. i mean, i know the guitarist left and a lot of people believed he was the soul of blur. but let me tell you: blur has always been damon's band. sure, this sounds a little more like the gorillaz record a couple years back than it does blur's last album, but it's so damn good, what does that matter? i didn't hear a groovier record this year. &quot;good song&quot; is one of my favorites: never has a song bore such a modest title.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|A great CD. If you like Tool, than you'll love this CD considering its the same lead singer. Tool's orginal 'poetry' and vibrant sound carry over to the Thirteenth Step and of course A Perfect Circle. Most of the songs are great. <br /> <br />Great Songs: <br />The Package <br />Weak And Powerless <br />The Noose <br />Vanishing <br />The Outsider <br /> <br />Songs to Avoid: <br />The Nurse Who Loved Me <br />Pet <br />Lullaby <br /> <br />Overall a great CD beside the filler parts of it. If you don't know who Tool is, that I suggest also buying Lateralus - Tool in conjunction with this CD.
B000002LND|4.0|i probably would never have owned this album, but i found it for a ridiculously cheap 2 bucks and wouldn't have been able to live with myself without snatching it off the rack. this is worth 2 bucks many times over. most all the great ones are here, but nothing--in my opinion--approaches the perfection of &quot;like a prayer&quot;...the only song with a drum machine that we studied in my &quot;history of rock 'n' roll&quot; class a couple years ago. i sure do wish she'd stop cavorting around with britney spears, though. just hurting her image...she could have faded away respectfully enough, might even have had a few more great singles in her. but now, it's anybody's guess as to where her career is headed. (that terrible movie about sex on the beach or whatever didn't help matters either.)
B00005YUNY|5.0|&quot;Yes&quot; always has an omnipotent presence in concert and their musical talents are amazing. Even Jon Anderson's vocals are nearly the same as they were over thirty years ago. This great concert sounds fantastic in DTS or Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. I suggest turning the volume WAY up. The camera work is typical of any concert with lots of (thankfully short) close-ups of the German backing orchestra (they are extremely talented, however). There is a nice ambiance when using an orchestra instead of keyboards and it works very well here. The orchestra members are generally very young, but their intense joy and talent is not lost here. All of Yes's best songs are represented here, almost to every single note (&quot;Ritual&quot; being one example). There's not a lot of flashiness, but each band member has their chance at solo work and the results are perfect. The documentary is just for fun and the bonus video is a nice addition.
B00018D3JQ|5.0|Heard part of the album in France in April, couldn't find it before I left. Highly recommend it.
B00009RAJI|4.0|This expanded version of the Rumours album features a second set of Roughs and Outtakes, as well as some early demos and jam sessions. The booklet has also been expanded, featuring lyrics, many photographs, and an essay about the making of Rumours. <br />  <br /> Below is my review of each disc: <br /> Disc: 1 <br />  <br /> 1. Second Hand News  <br /> 2. Dreams  <br /> 3. Never Going Back Again  <br /> 4. Don't Stop  <br /> 5. Go Your Own Way <br /> 6. Songbird  <br /> 7. Silver Springs  <br /> 8. The Chain  <br /> 9. You Make Loving Fun  <br /> 10. I Don't Want to Know  <br /> 11. Oh Daddy  <br /> 12. Gold Dust Woman  <br />  <br /> What can be said of disc one that hasn't been said. This is virtually a perfect album. Every song is a classic. The remastering vastly improves the sound quality from the original CD release of Rumours back in the mid 80's.  <br />  <br /> Some people have an issue with the insertion of \\"Silver Springs\\" in the middle of the Rumours track order. I don't share in this, as I think placing the song at the end would be awkward. Positioned at track 7 fits well with the flow of the album. A good decision, in my opinion. <br />  <br /> A bad decision, however, was not to include the ORIGINAL single version that we all know and love, and instead use a new remixed version that bring's Stevie Nicks' vocals too far forward and overpowering the beautiful harmonies. The powers be \\"fixed\\" something that wasn't broken in the first place! Simply a HORRIBLE decision. <br />  <br /> Disc: 2 <br />  <br /> 1. Second Hand News - Doesn't differ significantly from the original Rumours version.  <br /> 2. Dreams News - Doesn't differ significantly from the original Rumours version. This arrangement is somewhat sparse, with Stevie's voice is somewhat more upfront in the mix, giving the song an somewhat more intimate quality. <br /> 3. Brushes (Never Going Back Again) - This is essentially the instrumental track (no vocals), with a different opening. An interesting, slightly different approach to this song <br /> 4. Don't Stop - Features a winding organ part towards the end of the song. - Doesn't differ significantly from the original Rumours version.  <br /> 5. Go Your Own Way - Doesn't differ significantly from the original Rumours version.  <br /> 6. Songbird - One of my favorites from Rumours, as it's always a delight to hear. However, this version doesn't differ significantly from the original Rumours version. The guitar, mostly in the right channel, strangely drops in suddenly on the left channel at 1:58. <br /> 7. Silver Springs - Another remix of this beautiful song.. As stated previously, I wish they would have just included the original single mix on disc one.  <br /> 8. You Make Loving Fun - Features an interesting funky, false start, as well as some nice alternate background vocals. <br /> 9. Gold Dust Woman #1 - Different vocal inflections from Stevie, but the music is essentially the same. Sounds more angry to me. The ending features some haunting vocal work from Nicks. <br /> 10. Oh Daddy - Very different vocals - Christine McVie's voice was brought forward in the mix, and Stevie Nicks's background vocals are more pronounced.  <br /> 11. Think About It - A very stripped down, funky version. I really liked this version.  <br /> 12. Never Going Back Again - An instrumental version. Nothing that special  <br /> 13. Planets of the Universe - An early Stevie Nicks song, recently resurrected on her 2001 CD \\"Trouble In Shangri-La\\" . <br /> 14. Butter Cookie (Keep Me There) - A previously unreleased Christine McVie song. While I loved her songs on Rumours, this song was justifiable left off. The lyrics are unfinished and therefore some bluff vocals are sung instead. <br /> 15. Gold Dust Woman - An extremely stripped down version. Consider this \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" unplugged. Probably my favorite track on disc 2.  <br /> 16. Doesn't Anything Last - A previously unreleased Lindsey Buckingham song. I liked this song as well. Because it is a demo, it's also features the sparse unplugged type of feel. This song is incomplete and ends suddenly. <br /> 17. Mic the Screecher - Some noodling in the studio while the tape rolled on. Not something that bears repeated listening.  <br /> 18. For Duster (The Blues) - A 4:26 blues style jam, harkening back to the early style of Fleetwood Mac. An interesting way to close disc 2. <br />  <br /> What's amazing is that the rough demos and outtakes of the Rumours songs presented on the second disc don't differ much from the released versions, indicating that the songs were pretty much recorded as originally envisioned. Unfortunately, that also means you're less likely to come back to the second disc, as the originally released versions are for the most part the best version. <br />  <br /> So it is worth buying this set? The remastered material sounds great, and it's nice to finally have \\"Silver Springs\\" included with the other Rumours tracks. However, the second disc really doesn't present anything all that unique and essential for anyone but the most avid Fleetwood Mac fan, and the screw up with \\"Silver Springs\\" is criminal. Given the $20.99 price of the expanded edition vs the 13.99 price of the standard CD, well, the choice is up to you. <br />  <br /> Even though this is an absolutely classic album, I am rating it with only four stars due to the &quot;Silver Sprinsg&quot; screw up, as well as the unessential second disc. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> One last note - the DVD-Audio version present the Rumours tracks in remastered sound with the ORIGINAL version of \\"Silver Springs\\", so for some of you that may be the best way to go.

0618526412|5.0|If I could give this book TEN stars, I would. I love this book! It held me spellbound -- the characters had life -- flesh and blood, hands reaching out and picking at my sleeve to get attention, proud eyes looking at self-deprecating failures, wise eyes looking into mine. I heard the whispered secret thoughts of a grimy young girl whose ambitions go far beyond the shanties and dirt roads in her town, and who grew up right before my eyes. Who can't remember being 12 -- that magical age when everything new in life starts rushing toward you and you suddenly realize that YOU start calling the shots.<br /><br /> I smiled at the way the two hearing-impaired friends shared their mornings, and wept over their loss -- made especially sad by the different reactions each man had. I held on to my temper as Blount ranted and raved and I wanted SO badly to tell Biff: &quot;Alice IS right -- throw him out!!!&quot;<br /><br /> Dry, Southern clay sifted into my hair and onto my face and was all over my city shoes as I walked in between the tilting shacks called &quot;home&quot;, smelling the musty odors, sweat and rancid beer coming out of open windows in the opppressive heat. My mouth watered as Portia cooked yet another meal for her beloved yet oh so different father, and I wanted so badly to tell him: &quot;Can't you just love her for the way she is???&quot;.<br /><br /> Then my feet burned on the hot hot sidewalks as I followed Mick and Bubber, the red wagon wheels creaking from a combination of dust in the wheel-bearings and just plain old age. I held on tightly as Mick balanced on the rooftop, and I sang with her.<br /><br /> For the all-too brief time that it took to read this incredible book (Carson did it again!!!), I was wrapped up in the sweet syrupy closeness of a small-time Southern Town, when life went by slowly and people had time to think - maybe too much time to think. I was part of that community, their joys were mine -- their losses were mourned.<br /><br /> My only criticism? I think that the way in which this book meanders so nicely is suddenly pushed out of the way by accelerating action toward the conclusion. But who am I to complain? Isn't that the way life sometimes goes???<br /><br /> Like &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, this book is one that I will pick up and read MANY MANY more times. Why? Because when you meet and make friends like that -- you MUST go back and visit them occasionally!/>  <br /> My only criticism?

B000003TA2|5.0|I ecpecialy like the song Dirty Boots and Kool Thing but the rest of the album is great too.
B000001FSR|5.0|..but with Tom Waits, that's exactly how it should be. Frank's Wild Years was my first disc of his, and boy it had taken a while to reach the point where I got the courage to get it.  <br /> That has all changed.  <br /> The man is, as someone else said here: &quot;...a genius, complete unto himself..&quot; and even if you don't like his music, or try (and fail) to get it, I would still have to say the summation is right. <br /> Tom Waits has created a musical universe all his own, and I personally still feel &quot;Frank's Wild Years&quot; is one of his greatest discs. <br /> What underpin even his most way-out recordings are honesty, compassion, and, yes, innocence that bore right through the characters he embodies, and in turn, tear you apart when you play the disc. His beautifully broken voice, combined with the &quot;don't mow the lawn' approach to recording give the songs a grubby yet epic quality hard to overstate or describe. <br /> I feel &quot;Tom's Wild Years&quot;, with its more &quot;mainstream&quot; (relatively speaking) approach, is a good entry point for newcomers. It also happens to be one of his masterpieces. <br />  <br /> CC <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
B000023VR6|4.0|there's no doubt that this album set a benchmark for Aftermath to begin swallowing the mainstream-yet-talented rap industry with em, 50, g-unit and all that noise. basically it gave dre enough credit as a beat-maker to survive making the moves that he made. i would recommend it to any hip-hop head (or pothead) as a part of your collection. unfortunately, however, most people don't know that jay-z wrote dre's verses on both &quot;still dre&quot; and &quot;what's the difference&quot;, which discredits some of the best lyricism on the disc.. still dre particularly, which is a good, insightful summary of the beat guru's founding and return to the industry.
B000001IPL|4.0|Smash is the only Offspring album anyone needs to own, although Ignition and Ixnay are good choices too. <br /> <br />Lately Offspring can be viewed as sellouts, with a cleaner look and smoother music. On this CD, which really was their break-out cd, they were gritty, foul mouthed, and full of energy. Labeled a Punk band they play  aheavier form of punk that is almost heavy rock and is a good introduction to punk for people getting into the genre as it includes alot of rebellious and catchy tunes. <br /> <br /> <br />Song Highlights: <br /> <br />3. Bad Habit 5/5 <br />My favorite song on the cd. The song is about road rage and stats off very slow but when the song kicks in it really kicks in. I can't help laughing when i listen to the lyrics that are very humorous (in a dark way) and its a very fast moving song, with ensues in deloberate thrashing.  <br /> <br />7. Come Out and Play 5/5 <br />First single, and an amazing song. Hard hitting, not so fast, good melody and the beat and bass line is catchy. Everyone who grew up in the 90's has heard this song at least once. Once again, social commentary, this time about gang violence.  <br /> <br />8. Self Esteem 5/5 <br />The Second single, which sounds a little different then any of the other songs on the CD. This is the cd's million dollar song, and the price of the CD is worth it for this song alone.  <br /> <br />11. What Happened to You? 4/5 <br />OPffspring has a ska-beat influenced song that works very well and shows off Offspring's musical ability and ease at which they can experiment with influences. <br /> <br />Thoughts: <br />This is old Offspring and came out in 1994-95 (dont exactly remember when). It  has a very different sound then today's Offspring. Here on Smash we have rawer, more aggressive, innovative and harder music that is kind of punk, kind of hard hard rock. I would say this is their best CD, having enough of the indie grittiness and freedom of expression and the pop-punk catchiness to their songs.  <br /> <br />Conclusion: <br />This cd is always goodto listen to from time to time after you have played it out for yourself. It has many noteworthy songs on it and only one or two filler songs and is a great introduction ot harder rock and punk. For people like me who grew up in the 90's, this album is what we would play when we rebelled and wanted to shock our parents, and it is still a good listen after all these years.

B00005ATQF|5.0|First off is Stanley Kubrick's addition to the slew of Vietnam war films that came out during the '86-'87 film season. Based on an effective novella about the Vietnam War titled Short-Timers, Kubrick's take on that war and the military (specifically the U.S. Marine Corps.) at that time is one that's very anti-war and also shows the dehumanizing effect that young men go through to become effective soldiers.<br /><br />I agree with Ed that the first half of the film during Corps bootcamp is very effective and also very brutal. The dehumanizing tactics used to turn soldiers like Pvts. Joker, Cowboy and Pyle into killing machines has Kubrick's style written all over it. Kubrick succeeded in showing the brutality of their training, yet still keeps the audience at a distance. Its almost clinical in the way he pulled it off. The stand out performances by R. Lee Ermey as Gunny and a young Vincent D'Onofrio as Pvt. Pyle made the first half of Full Metal Jacket a classic in my book. The second half on the other hand loses some of the effectiveness of the bootcamp scenes.<br /><br />Kubrick tried to show the inhumanity of war through scenes for the Battle for Hue. The scenes are well-shot, but Kubrick's knowledge of city-fighting was very limited and he has talked about it in some detail that he didn't want to really show the battle accurately. He needed a major set piece and the Battle for Hue was a major battle the USMC fought in and used it. This second half is also where he deviated from the book. The book showed the camraderie that Joker and Cowboy had during bootcamp and then throughout Hue and showed that even through war's inhumanity and insanity soldiers kept a bond with their comrades that allowed for heroism to shine through. Kubrick's take on the second half was that war made instant cynics and murderers of people no matter how principled they may be.<br /><br />I may disagree with the second half's treatment of the book and of Kubrick's unsubtle antiwar message, but this film has to count as one of his best. Right up there with The Shining. Spartacus and Lolita.age, but this film has to count as one of his best. Right up there with The Shining. Spartacus and Lolita.
B000001Y2U|1.0|Marilyn Manson is one of the sickest most evil people ever!! I don't know how anyone could listen to his disgusting adhorrent awful music. You have to be like really insane and crazy to like this nutcase. The things he does and stuff he says is not even describable. UH!!!! Enough said!!!!!  <br /> (i hope you like hell &quot;Brian Hugh Warner&quot;)
B00000JGHM|5.0|Michael Mann's (writer-director) 1995 seminal cops-and-robbers classic still stands up very well almost a decade since its release. Mann's directing is top-notch especially since he also doubled as the writer for the film. The story is well-written and doesn't branch off into unnecessary subplots as some films try to do to fill up time. His direction of the main set-piece in the middle of the film --- the main shoot out after a daily bank robbery --- was well choreographed and really had an air of realism that most film shoot-outs don't seem to have. The sequence was so realisitc that I couldn't blame the news media using it as an example of it giving the North Hollywood bank-robbers ideas when they held up and shot it out with the LAPD a year later.<br /><br />What I liked best of this film is the first time on-screen pairing of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro. These two veteran actors I consider the best actors of their generation. It was surprising that they've never worked together before. The scene between them in the diner was just perfect. No witty dialogue that usually makes a weaker actor sound better, but just plain old dialogue that shows both characters having more in common than they would like to admit. This scene also hinted at their mutual respect for each other even up to the very last scene of the film. I highly recommend this film for those who haven't seen it and a must-dvd-buy for those who are looking to add a title to their collection.<br /><br />Hopefully, Warner Brothers will finally give this classic crime-thriller a dvd treatment it really deserves.
B000092Q4U|5.0|When I first heard Lamb Of God, I saw some of their videos on MTV2 Headbangers Ball while I was in Indiana. Then I quickly picked up As The Palaces Burn along with their first album New American Gospel, and I was hooked to it right away. The vocals were just awesome, the guitar riffs and the insane double basses are so catchy, you just get every song stuck in your head for days and never get tired of them. A true heavy metal assault, I love it. Favorite Songs: Ruin, 11th Hour, and As The Palaces Burn.
6305263248|5.0|This 1998 spy-thriller from the late John Frankenheimer more than makes up for the current crop of spy-thrillers to come out of Hollywood: The Sum of All Fears, The Bourne Identity and The Recruit to name a few. The plot is straighforward enough for even the most slow audience to follow. Out of work former covert operatives hire themselves out to the highest bidder to acquire an item other parties are intent on acquiring themselves. The title comes from the Japanese word describing masterless samurai who have become lost and hire themselves out as brigands, mercenaries, etc...<br /><br />Robert DeNiro's work as the lead is exemplary and shows why he's considered one of the best actors of the last 30 years. His portrayal of his character is understated when compared to his more notable roles. The other stand out in Ronin is French-actor Jean Reno. The professional relationship between DeNiro's and Reno's characters help pull together the rest of the cast and the rest did a very good job with the parts they were given. Even Sean Bean's small time onscreen is time well spent.<br /><br />The other thing that I must point out as a plus about this film is Frankenheimer's work on shooting the film's many car chase sequence. Instead of relying on lots of explosions, FX-work and over-the-top stunt work, Frankenheimer's car chase scenes has the look of realism that is rare in many action-films these days. If one wants to see a spy-thriller and a car chase scene done right, one can't go wrong by watching this film.

B00008EY65|5.0|Hellboy I just saw and enjoyed very much. It doesn't match up to the original source materials it was taken from --- one of the best written and drawn comics in the last 20 years --- but what film ever lives up to their books.<br /><br />For fans of the comics, this film is a must-see. There are some changes made to keep the film from becoming too much of a copy of the books. The changes didn't bother me too much. Some ideas were taken from other Hellboy stories, but you have to be a major fan of the work to notice them.<br /><br />For casual film fans, this film is a hit or miss. The film has a classic pulp, serial look and also doesn't try to make itself out to be something too serious, or life changing. This is supposed to be a fun film and I think it succeeds.<br /><br />The Hellboy comics are a gold mine for ideas. The graphic novel that this film was based on is not even the best, but good enough as an introductory film. If they give the go ahead for a sequel, I wish that Del Toro look hard at using the Wake the Devil graphic novel as a sequel: Vampires, reborn Greek Goddess, insane Nazi scientists, and more on Hellboy's origins and purpose.
B00005ASIL|4.0|If you will notice in the track listing three of the songs are marked as the edited version and Thick as A Brick is so edited that they didn't even mention it.  I thought that this was a great album until I realized that the original songs were much better than the edited ones on this cd.  Jethro Tull just has too much music to come out with a one disc best of and not get complaints.  One of the saddest tracks is Thick As a Brick.  I realize that they had to recognize that it was great but was it worth it to cut it down to 3 minutes?
B00012FXAE|5.0|People say that Terminator 2: Judgement Day was James Cameron's best film that didn't involve a big ass boat sinking, but this sequel to Ridley Scott's Alien shows the master at work.<br /><br />Going a different route from the one Ridley Scott took with the first film, Cameron decided to make the sequel less horror (to be honest there's not a moment of horror in this film) and more action-oriented. Aliens pretty much gave birth to a whole sub-genre of scifi films that pitted small numbers of humans against large numbers of aliens. The game Starcraft even has some of its design influenced by Cameron's film.<br /><br />The acting by Weaver as Ripley and to a certain degree of Michael Biehn as Cpl. Hicks keeps the film from becoming all action and style, but no substance. Actually, the mostly unknown group of actors who comprised the small cast did pretty well. Characters one thought to be good and honest ended up being worst that the aliens in the end.<br /><br />The production design in the film doesn't look dated at all. This film could be shown right now in the theaters and it will still look better than a majority of the scifi work thats being released. People these days try to over-design futuristic sets and props.<br /><br />The action sequences doesn't let up one bit once it starts and this is where Cameron does his best work. Each scene flows seemlessly from one to the other. Aliens is pretty much an old-fashioned World War II movie that is set in space instead of Earth.<br /><br />Cameron also took the concept of the alien and gave it more character and life. In the original film, Scott's alien pretty much acted as some extraterrestrial boogeyman. In Aliens. Cameron and writer Dan O'Bannon gave the creature more history and background that continues to be the basis for the next two sequel and the many comics based on the creature.<br /><br />Aliens qualifies as one of the best scifi-action films ever made. Some have tried to capture its look and feel, but none have been able to do so. I still think Scott's Alien is a much superior film overall, but for sheer rollercoaster fun Cameron's sequel is a close second. A very close second.feel, but none have been able to do so.

B00008EY65|5.0|Awesome is the only word to describe the beauty of this movie.  It had a real plot, short, but effective.  It was a great movie.  Not as funny as Men In Black, but it's not supposed to be.  I really enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />Hellboy makes the Spawn movie look tragically lame.<br /><br />That minion of Rasputin's gave me the ultimate heebie jeebies.  I'm going to have nightmares about him.<br /><br />The horrible evil unleashed at the end reminded me of Lovecraft's Yog-sothoth!!!<br /><br />Hellboy rocks.<br /><br />The director and screenwriter Del Toro deserves a nod for this.  Art as its creator intended.  Bravo! Can't wait for a sequel.
6305014140|5.0|Wow only begins to describe this anime. I saw it almost 10 years ago and it is still way way above some of the anime past and present. Non-stop action all the way through, exotic and deadly enemies,backstabbing, betrayal, gore( maybe a hair much, but nobody's perfect) this movie had it all. It was so good that it was bad for me because I started to compare every other anime I saw to this one and a lot of good anime didnt' compare at the time. This movie is great and if you are thinking about getting into anime, this one will blow your socks away. The only other drawback would be that maybe, and just maybe they should have had a little more background on Jubei and Gemma. That would have been really cool. Like I said though, that's just being picky. To me Ninja Scroll is the best anime of all time
B000002UB3|5.0|It's too bad this, the final album they recorded, couldn't have been released last too, in lieu of their embarrassing penultimate album LIB, which just leaves a bad taste in the ears. AR would have been the perfect swan song. At the time, it was also their biggest-selling album, with five million copies sold. Even without all of the hype surrounding it, this is a great album that really stands up and has withstood the test of time brilliantly. They really worked together as a band again on this album, something they hadn't done for a long time, and really got back to basics, instead of bringing in lots of outside musicians to play exotic instruments or adding multiple layers to the songs. They were good enough to be made in a back-to-basics style, which was a welcome break from their more recent albums, where they had mostly been recording solo or experiencing a very tense atmosphere when they did all work together. Unlike LIB and the White Album, they were in very happy spirits during the recording of this album.<br /><br /> Some people don't rate this album as highly as their other great albums because most of the songs on side two are medlies instead of full complete songs, but it wouldn't be AR without them! They fit together into whole songs despite being composed of fragmented parts. And the second of the two medlies, &quot;Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End&quot; is such a perfect swan song it couldn't not be on this album. (It's kind of weird to have it be followed by any song, let alone the 23-second &quot;Her Majesty,&quot; a song snippet Paul wanted thrown away.)

B00005LOUP|5.0|Celebrating Christmas in August, I decided to watch this movie the other day, since I hadn't seen it in a long time and wanted to give it a second chance. After all, after my first viewing, I'd given it the same rating as so many others. The same type of horrid review the \\"Cat in the Hat\\" movie has gotten. By the time the Whobilation was over, I had thought the entire movie was finished and then wondered when exactly the Grinch was going to try to steal Christmas. Well, having matured a little and watched through the film with a more positive attitude, I can now say that it is nothing close to the superficial, vulgar, boring disaster I once believed it to be. Contrary to what some may say, this movie is worth seeing--and not just once. Yes, it's a different story than the Grinch book. Who says that's a fault? You must appreciate this film for what it is on its own, and that's something that is only based on the book. The movie is creative and elaborates on things the book barely touches. Max is a brilliant canine actor, and while he's clearly not of the same breeds as the dog in the original, he's near enough.<br /><br /> Would this film ever replace the cherished Boris Karloff cartoon? Never! But the half-hour cartoon need not even be mentioned in a review of this movie. Ron Howard's film is both funny and touching, and tells people it's different right off the bat with a setting located inside a snowflake, and some variations/additions to the Grinch poems/songs. Pretty near everything about this movie is above satisfactory; the acting, the scenery, the make-up. Cindy Lou's \\"Where are you Christmas?\\" song could be called, admittedly, somewhat random, pointless, dull, etc. However, when seen from the proper angle, it's kind of cute. And it's so short, I was actually surprised when the little girl didn't continue singing and the scene cut directly to the Grinch's lair. The whimsical, elaborate sets are truly brilliant, and do the best they can to fully transport you to Whoville. Look closely for all the clever little pieces of work put into them, such as the \\"E Pluribus Whonum\\" on the town hall. And Mary Stein, if anyone knows her from the Babe sequel, isn't instantly recognizable but is fantastic as Miss Rue Who.<br /><br /> This film will become a holiday classic in its own right; it won't replace or compete with the previous Grinch we all know and love. I found it nice to see that the moviemakers had read into the original Seuss story a bit and decided that, not only do the innocent Whos have some valid points to make, but so does the old Grinch. The Whos are good people, but a tad naive, as they have gotten caught up in material presents so much that they've almost forgotten the gifts that are more important. They know deep down what the holiday's all about, but they simply need to tap into it. Funnily enough, the Grinch helps them do just that. Another point: claims that the movie revokes lessons parents have tried to teach their children by encouraging them to approach strangers, wander off, etc., are entirely ungrounded. I won't even go into it except to say that, living inside a snowflake, little Cindy Lou doesn't exactly have much to worry about. Oh, and we're not supposed to feel sorry for the mayor in the end; if there was one Who who really needed to learn a lesson, it was him.<br /><br />The cast of brand new characters is quite well developed; the added backstory of the Grinch's past and, most especially, Martha May Whovier (Christine Baranski), is adorable. She is beautiful, and may at first seem almost perfect in a superficial way--but she is in fact not shallow. She loves the Grinch because she sees in him what no other adults do, and she is strong. (Frankly, I always could have made perfect sense of someone having a crush on the Grinch--at least, the old animated and illustrated renditions of him!)<br /><br />Also perfectly cast is Betty Lou Who, Cindy Lou's dowdy mother, portrayed by Molly Shannon. One thingI couldn't entirely figure out was the deleted scenes on the DVD. Sure, the \\"Wholiday Shopping\\" song is indeed irritating enough to be understandably cut out, but one brief scene in which the Grinch's \\"boo hoos\\" are coming from the mouths of the Whos on Christmas morning is very, very funny. At first I was shocked to see Betty Lou, the first one; \\"Why is she crying like a man?!\\" At any rate, I recommend seeing this movie and giving it a real chance. You may find that it's a new favorite to be watched each holiday season.I couldn't entirely figure out was the deleted scenes on the DVD.

0553274503|5.0|I was introduced to this story by means of the long short story version of it, which was the first thing my seventh grade English class (which we had at an eighth grade honours level) read.  I really really liked it, and was really excited when the teacher told us that there was a much longer version of this story out there, a book, with stuff that wasn't covered in the short story, like Charlie's sister Norma, his childhood, and his mother.  I read the book version in June of 1995, a bit over two and a half years later.  It was just as good as the short story, and even better, because of all of the extra details.<br /><br />Even though Charlie is retarded mentally, psychologically, and emotionally, his heart isn't retarded.  He knows he isn't that smart, but is a really kind person, and wants very much to learn and to become smarter.  When he is first introduced to little Algernon, a mouse who had an operation which made him smarter, he is very frustrated that even a mouse could be smarter and more intelligent than he is, but with the support of his teacher Alice, he doesn't give up hope.  He has the operation, and slowly starts becoming smarter.  It isn't full-blown, though; in the early days he sometimes gets carried away with his newfound knowledge, like when he goes crazy with punctuation when he first learns about it, using it all over the place even when it's not correct.  And as he gets more and more smarts and intelligence, he also becomes aware of how his co-workers at the bakery weren't laughing with him when they went out to dinner and dancing before, they were laughing at him, making a fool of him, and encouraging other people to ridicule him and to laugh at him.  He finds out who his real friends are, though as he continues to get smarter and smarter still, even his old real friends, like Alice, begin to distance themselves from him, since he's become too smart for them as well.  This starts to change when Algernon's intelligence begins a steady downward spiral, and Charlie is afraid the same thing will happen to him.  The results are heartbreaking.ward spiral, and Charlie is afraid the same thing will happen to him.  The results are heartbreaking.
B00005JLSE|5.0|What words can I find to describe this musical-turned-movie? How about stunning, spectacular, electrifying, dazzling, etc. etc.?!? This movie is so well-done it's difficult to adequately describe. &quot;Chicago&quot; thoroughly deserves all its honor and recognition. No matter how many times you watch it, you will still be thrilled by it. The song and dance numbers are beyond catchy; they cause an audience to want to get up and join in on them. My personal favorite part of this film is the Cell Block Tango--the six murderesses are just too much fun to watch and listen to! &quot;Chicago&quot; is a truly great film and one that should definitely be seen by everyone at least once.
1400049628|5.0|I've bought three copies of this book, one for myself and two as gifts for friends. They both loved it, and so did I. So here I am to recommend it.  <br />  <br /> The Zombie Survival Guide is a notoriously difficult book to classify. It would be laughed at if it were shelved with other &quot;survival&quot; books, yet it doesn't seem to fit in with humour because it's not technically funny. It's a parody. Therein lies the humour. It probably won't have you in stitches (no pun intended), since the book is written &quot;with a straight face&quot; on something that (if it were real) would be an extremely gory and disturbing subject. If you can appreciate this book as a parody...well, you won't be laughing out loud, but you'll be highly amused and very entertained.  <br />  <br /> Basically, this book is a very entertaining parody of survival books that happens to use one of the old horror stand-bys: zombie hoards. Let's be honest: would most of us know the first thing about how to survive if we woke up one day to see the walking dead at our doorstep moaning for our sweet, sweet brains? Sadly, the answer is a resounding NO. This book details the basics of what every person who values their lives -- and their brains -- should know about surviving a zombie attack: which weapons work and which ones don't, what supplies should be a priority, which buildings make good shelters, historical records of past zombie attacks, terrain types, as well as tactics for being barricaded in your home, on the run, partaking in zombie hunting, or -- should the unthinkable happen -- hiding out as the undead hoards sweep across the Earth. The Zombie Survival Guide won't guarentee your survival, but it will certainly give you an advantage over the poor shmuck who doesn't even know to shoot for the head. <br />  <br /> The only real con about this book comes up if you buy it expecting a laugh-out-loud humour book. If so, look elsewhere. This is a parody that never strays from its serious demeanor. Not to scare anyone off; it's quite readable, and has enough of a coloquial feel to appeal to the average civilian. It's an amusing parody and an enjoyable read, but the book doesn't wink-wink-nudge-nudge the reader or go for one-liners and laughs.  <br />  <br /> The pros are simple: it's a higly enjoyable parody of survival books, with an extremely cool topic. If you're a zombie movie buff, this book will let you smirk at your superior knowledge of zombie-fighting tactics when the idiots in the movies wouldn't know a zombie if it bit them. (Alright, THAT pun was intended.) If you're looking for a good reference book about survival tactics and the like, this is a readable variation that's probably more entertaining than most. (The lists of gear to carry seem pretty logical in ANY dire situation.) Yet even if you read the book and fully accept it as a parody, it still has a way of getting to you. You'll find yourself idly wondering if you have enough food in your house to last through a seige, or whether you should invest in a machete and a shotgun. Just in case.
B000069AUI|5.0|the first time i listened to &quot;a rush of blood to the head&quot;, i was expecting more mellow tunes like &quot;yellow&quot;, but this album, with more rock sounding songs, is now my favourite.  <br /> every song featured on &quot;arobtth&quot; is unique and a perfect example of songwriting. some make you feel like dancing, others make you want to just sit and think about your life, but each has a meaning and a great sounding one at that. <br />  <br /> 1.politik <br /> this song is my least favourite on the album, but definitely not a bad song. it's a very rock-y song, and too much for the first track, i thought. the lyrics and overall tune are great though. <br />  <br /> 2.in my place <br /> this song is probably the most mainstream pop, but with these fantastic lyrics, who cares? <br />  <br /> 3.god put a smile upon your face <br /> this is a really good song to give you a boost or to cruise around with, because its soothing with a distinct rock edge that just draws you in. <br />  <br /> 4.the scientist <br /> my favourite track, and song, of all time! the beat and tune in this song are so great, you feel like just sitting back and letting it wash over you, but listen to the lyrics and you'll feel so good. chris martin is a genius. i love the video clip for this too! <br />  <br /> 5.clocks <br /> this song is a highlight! the lyrics are superb and the video clip, though simple, really adds depth to the song. it's poppier than the rest of the tracks, but is a great tune to listen to at night. <br />  <br /> 6.daylight <br /> slot of coldplay fans think this is the worst track on the album, but i think it's just a more lighthearted song; better to dance to then to analyse. it's definitely the most dance-orientated track though. <br />  <br /> 7.green eyes <br /> this is where the album takes a turn, not getting better or worse, but going in a more indy/folksy direction, but still with the rock edge. this is another favourite track of mine, and it's a reallyromantic song. <br />  <br /> 8.warning sign <br /> another great song, lyric wise. the tune is so excellent and so addictive, it gets stuck in my head for days after i hear it. my second favourite track. <br />  <br /> 9.a whisper <br /> this track starts off sounding quite indy rock, almost a 60s rock sound, but the chorus is great, and the overall feel of this song is a feel-good vibe. <br />  <br /> 10.a rush of blood to the head <br /> this song has the best lyrics on the album, and it provokes you to contemplate life and love. the chorus actually is a rush of blood to the head, and is great to have sex to...  <br />  <br /> 11.amsterdam <br /> the slowest and one of the best tracks on the album. a real highlight with a very addictive beat. i usually repeat this song over and over just to hear the great chorus and lyrics.
0064407667|4.0|I stole this book from the Country Inn and Suites. I admit it. It was wrong, but I liked it so much that I took it with no intention of returning. Then, I figured &quot;why not take another copy for my niece?&quot; So I did.  <br />  <br /> This book is a little heap of clever evil storytelling. It is fitting that I acquired it due to thievery. I would recommend it to all children who are in search of a fun, cleverly written story. <br />  <br /> Adults enjoy it too. There is no political agenda here. Only great British storytelling in the tradition of &quot;101 Dalmations&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, and &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. <br />  <br /> Read it. You'll want to steal a copy for youself.
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|This movie is a dog. I found the flashback fantasies annoying, sappy, and boring all at the same time. The &quot;love your father&quot; moral is laudable, but the execution is painful at best. Don't even rent this one.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|The idea that the world around you would change -- perhaps dramatically -- if you changed something in your past goes back at least to the 1946 classic, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot; In &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot; this theme gets beaten to death (as is one of the characters in the movie, at least on one timeline).<br /><br /> Many reviewers have erroneously called this a &quot;time travel&quot; movie; it's really more of an examination of what might happen in one young man's life if he had the ability to project his adult persona back into the past and alter events in his childhood. And boy, does he have reason to do so! There's a lot of grim stufff back there!<br /><br /> Overall, the movie works fairly well, although it's pretty heavy-handed and Ashton Kutcher is no great shakes of an actor. He handles the lead role passably well, but it's no Oscar-level performance. And there are some places where Evan does things that are obviously stupid even at the time he does them; it's almost as if Kutcher's &quot;Kelso&quot; character from &quot;That '70s Show&quot; has taken over. Still, if you like movies of this genre, you'll probably be willing to overlook them. And Amy Smart shines as the ever-changing Kayley.<br /><br /> If you're expecting greatness, look elsewhere. But if you just want passable entertainment with a smidge of thought-provoking ideas mixed in -- and you don't mind depictions of violence directed against children and animals -- &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot; fills the bill.<br /><br /> PS: Of the two versions on this DVD, I personally preferred the version released in theatres.
B00005JMUA|2.0|There is less action in this volume than in the first, which makes it more tedious.  To be fair this is just the wrap up of Volume 1, but I found the second installment to be quite boring at times.  There are several scenes that could have been cut from both volumes and they should have been combined into a single movie.  Splitting the movie was a cheap grab for more money and this ploy should not be tolerated in the future.  Worth a rent if you've already seen Volume 1 and need closure. Otherwise skip it.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Sex and the City is about four single, professional women in their late twenties to early forties, who live in Manhattan. They have different personalities, but are fast friends. Samantha is a sex kitten who loves her single, swinging life. Charlotte is sweet and idealistic. Miranda is tough talking and confident. Carrie Bradshaw is a mix of all of them, probably closest in beliefs to those who watch the show. All the women are beautiful in their own way, but it is Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie who is the most vulnerable, natural, and thus the most beautiful. Carrie Bradshaw writes a weekly newspaper column called \\"Sex in the City,\\" where she explores dating dilemmas and philosophizes about them.<br /><br />The actresses aren't the only stars of the show. We have all heard about the shoes, the clothes, that fans of the show have demanded and purchased in high numbers. And not only the clothes, but even more so the City herself. The show is filmed all over New York - in the parks, at night on the streets, in innumerable restaurants with amazing ambience, in apartments, and clubs. Searching for meaning in the concrete jungle is a daunting task, and we are happy to share their experiences.<br /><br />The show IS very risque, with lots of nudity, sex, bad language, graphic dialouge. Yet the show has a moral heart - everything the friends do has consequences they must suffer. And in the end, doing what is right almost always prevails over what feels right.<br /><br />Season 1 contains two discs with six episodes each. Disc One has more belly laughs than the second, but they are both good. We are introduced to the four friends and their different attitudes. Carrie meets Mr. Big, who plays a large part on the show. These episodes were first aired on HBO June -August of 1998. The prominent shots of the Twin Towers in this pre-9/11 time are poignant.<br /><br />Disc One:<br />Episode 1: Sex and the City - The four friends are introduced.<br /><br /> Episode 2: Models and Mortals - Carrie encounters a man who is obsessed with dating only models.<br /><br /> Episode 3: Bay of Married Pigs - Carrie loses her friendship with a married couple (and the use of their house in the Hamptons) when the husband exposes himself to her. Even though it is not Carrie's fault, the wife treats her like a homewrecker.<br /><br /> Episode 4: Valley of the Twenty-Something Guys - Has one of the biggest laughs of the whole first season. I was roaring with laughter, and had my husband come and watch that part. Carrie explores the idea of thirty-something women dating twenty-something guys in order for the women to boost their own self-esteem.<br /><br /> Episode 5: The Power of Female Sex - On a whim, Miranda dates a puppyish boy named Skipper. Skipper becomes obsessed with Miranda.<br /><br /> Episode 6: Secret Sex - Carrie explores the fact that some people have \\"secret sex\\" - sex with someone they like and with whom the sex is great. Yet, they are ashamed to introduce this person to their friends.<br /><br /> Disc Two:<br /><br /> Episode 7: The Monogamists - Carrie asks the question, is monogamy obsolete?<br /><br /> Episode 8: Three's a Crowd - Charlotte is pressured by her boyfriend to engage in a threesome.<br /><br /> Episode 9: The Turtle and the Hare - Samantha tries to make over a financially successful, but horrendously nerdy man.<br /><br /> Episode 10: The Baby Shower - The four women attend a baby shower for one of their former wild friends. \\"The Cult of Motherhood\\" is a very funny idea that I wonder if it is true.<br /><br /> Episode 11: The Drought - Miranda is suffering from a sex drought; Samantha tries yogic celibacy; Charlotte gets addicted to a new vibrator called The Rabbit.<br /><br /> Episode 12: O Come All Ye Faithful - Carrie tells Mr. Big she loves him, with disastrous results - got to wait for second season to see what happens! This episode tries to explore religion, but fails to draw as meaningful a conclusion as the rest of theepisodes.lusion as the rest of the episodes.  <br />   <br />
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|Why do people like to see movies set in slums about scummy people doing crappy things?  If I want to see that kind of stuff, I'll just drive downtown.  The actors performed well, but seeing this just depressed me.  And every time I see Sean Penn, I feel like I need a shower.  If you want an uplifting movie, then don't see this.

B0001MDP3G|2.0|This is one of those movies that I enjoyed as long as I had the fast forward button under my thumb.  This is a nicely filmed, well acted movie, but it is also very long and quite boring at times.  Kidman is always nice to look at, Zellwegger had an interesting performance, and Law was credible as a soldier.  The ending was also not the usual Hollywood happy ending, which I found refreshing if not a little depressing.  If you feel like a quiet, slow paced movie then by all means rent this.  It is certainly not worth purchasing since I could not imagine sitting through it again-Kidman nudity notwithstanding.
B000031XCR|3.0|I first came to like Celine's music after seeing her performance of Power of Love on an award's show... After hearing more of her music, I was even more impressed.  Of course, after hearing continuous radio marathons of My Heart Will Go On, as well as listening to her other top 10 hits on the radio,...well truthfuly, one can get tired of her voice.   <br />This album has all the songs that were overplayed on the radio, as well as a cover of All The Way. And if that's not enough, there's also a few lesser known songs on the album - none of which I would say is a decent song tho.
B00005JMEW|3.0|This movie is entertaining due to its extreme violence and cartoonish bloodshed.  The soundtrack is also very well selected.  The plot is the usual revenge story and Uma convincingly portrays the wronged assassin.  My only complaint is that Vol. 1 and 2 could have easily been combined into a single movie.  There are many slow and uninvolving parts in both volumes that should have been cut.  By separating the story into 2 installments, Tarantino effectively doubles his profits.  This cheap and obvious money grab left a bad impression and I will not be so eager to see another of his films.  Worth a rent, but not a buy.
B00005JN2F|5.0|Far better than the the original, and the original was very good. People complain about the camera angles and action shots but I feel that help make the scenes more dramatic. Absolutely loved this movie, and can not wait for another. The plot was twisted and Matt Damon is born to play in roles such as this. I wish there were more of them instead of the same stunts and and weaker performances.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|When I first caught this on PBS, I was a little skeptical.  So many Beatles cover albums or attempts seem to fall so short of my expectations (George Martin had a really bad one a few years back, and I Am Sam can be summed up as okay), and though all these people were friends with George I wasn't sure even they would get it right.  Man was I wrong!  <br /> <br />It's a very heartfelt and touching concert.  Such strong musicians as Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, Tom Petty, and Eric Clapton do George and his music justice.  I love when people bring out the ukeleles, or ukes as everyone seems to call them, for songs like Something and I'll See You In My Dreams, which made me cry and still does every time I see it.   <br /> <br />The extras are pretty good, and it's nice to have both versions of the concert.  The Python featurette is without a doubt the best of the extras, with Eric Idle poking fun at his rear and the irony of Michael Palin reading tavel magazines.  <br /> <br />Although this is a rather expensive DVD it is definately worth every penny.  PBS has great specials and concerts, and this one is another great one to add to the library.

Because, Paul DiPodesta, Billy Beane's assistant and the co-star of this book is now the Dodgers General Manager. He just made a huge trade that has left many &quot;conventional&quot; baseball thinkers shaking their heads. But having read &quot;Moneyball&quot;, I can look at the moves he's made and at least understand where he's coming from. The majority of fans, writers, and his peers can't understand his moves and as you will find out in the book, that's perfectly fine with him!!

B00013RC8O|5.0|I first saw this, accidently, as past of a double feature not too long after I finished my USAF tour of duty and was in grad school. At first, being a former jet jockey--as we said then--I was really blown away by the car and the stunts...and, a good to really good soundtrack that had several folks who went on to bigger things. I even got a white R/T Challenger. But, then I realized how Kowasksi,like many of us, had walked the straight and narrow and then the shady side of the street. But,he could not find the answer/an answer in either venue. So, he chose death. How close many people have come to that point---the vanishing point. I look at today's drug culture (culture?); the gays; the religious zealots; the racism; the drop-outs (aka slackers)and I believe little has changed. The movie, with different clothing a a few modernisms, could be made today and be as compelling and accurate. But, where do you find a car like the white Challenger?
B000002U82|5.0|This album is awsome I listened to it about 50 times already.If you close you eyes from breath to time you will be suprised what would happen.Get this album or I'm going to find you and hunt you down!!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|The first time you listen to this CD, it sucks. The second time, you're hooked. Every part of the cd is so well made, that you hear a tune even when the singer repeats only one word over and over (listen to him singing &quot;the raindrops&quot;). There are several small touches like this that make the music amazing to listen to, and the songs never get old no matter how many times you hear them. It does take at least two tries to like this CD though. Also, the whole CD has to be listened to without skipping or stopping to get the whole effect. Best songs: 2+2=5, Sit down Stand up, The Gloaming, Myxomitosis

B000001ES9|4.0|This is a really good album in so many words, and anyone who likes rush and/or zeppelin would be able to appreciate it. It is incomareable to the amazing things they would do later but is still really good; it does have something special in how light hearted and sort of with a rockin' optimstic aura.<br />John Rutsey is infact a pretty good drummer and people only find him really bad beacause they compare him to the absolutely spectabular Peart (who wouldnt look like crap beside him).<br />If youre a big zeppelin fan, a big rush fan, or a moderate fan of both, you'll definatly like this retro rush cd which is indeed nothing more but a Led copy. Hey! Its still a good one!

The love has always been there, but commitment wasn't. Will the two end up together, you'll just have to watch the movie because I wont spoil everything. <br /> <br />Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump is captivating. It's one of the greatest performances by an actor ever. He won the Oscar that year for Best Actor and it would have been a sham if he haven't. His peformance as the mentally challenged man in all the big events will bring you to tears. You leave the movie wishing you could be full of life and innocent like Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks is the man and In my opinion this is top 5 performances ever. You can't help but love him. No one else could have been Forrest. Nobody. <br /> <br />Robin Wright gives the performance of her carear in this movie. She's awesome as Jenny. She displays the emotions of the character so well. We can all relate to her character in a way. <br /> <br />The two characters cover almost all the major of events from the 60's on to the early 80's. They stir up memories and everything looks authentic. It's magical and funny as you think back about these two love birds and the situations they are in. <br /> <br />Gary Sinise gives the performance of his carear as well. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor but lost. He should have won it over Marin Landua. Lt. Dan brings more emotion to the movie as he relates to Forrest in different ways. There friendship is special and the two change each others lives. <br /> <br />Robert Zemcki's established himself as a Hollywood elite with Forrest Gump. He already had hits like Back to the Future and Who Frammed Roger Rabbit under his belt. Forrest Gump is the icing on the cake though. It's a special movie and the way he made it is beautiful. He deserved his Oscar for Best Director. <br /> <br />The movie is so well made. It won Oscars for Editing and Effects and you will see why. It was nominated for 13 Oscars and it won six. It could have easily won any of the others as well. <br /> <br />The DVD extras are great. There is a second disk jammed with stuff. The stuff on the making of the movie is great. The documentaries are great as well. If you love DVD extras, then pick it up. It's worth it. <br /> <br />This is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a passionate love story and an awesome tail of a man, just being himself. Everybody should see this movie at one point or another in life. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who isn't a teenager. It deserves it's PG-13 rating and some people argue an R rating, but I think thats stretching it. Buy this movie and experience the phenomenom that is Forrest Gump.
B000031WBQ|5.0|Musicians today need to be reminded of just how wonderful things were forty years ago and further back.  The artistry on this recording is so detailed and fine-tuned.  Mr. Rubinstein's phrasing is impeccable.  Listen to the nuance at the end of each phrase -- his shaping is exquisite.  He was that rare phenomenon: a gift to all of us -- he could express himself verbally and instrumentally and we are richer because of it.  Art is alive on this recording.  The technical acrobats of today need to open their ears and begin to listen to what music is.  I do not devalue all the artists today.  There are some who deserve our attention.  But let us not forget what we had.   <br /> <br />Music is not self-absorption (as so many performers seem to think it is), but communication on a deeper level.  We immediately enter the world of feelings.  Mr Rubinstein has left us a legacy and I am grateful to have had the experience of hearing him live some 34 years ago.  Wish it were now so that I could appreciate him even more. <br /> <br />Reiner is a powerhouse and commanding.  I'm crazy about his other recordings as well.  <br /> <br />The recording itself was well-done with the finest technology of the day.  The fidelity rings true.  It's very clean.  I'm sure the combined effort got raves back then and, to me, it still does.
B0001AP12G|5.0|...from Kanye West, leader of productions in the hip-hop world. He has finally released his own album, College Dropout, a vivid display of Kanye's true talent. After producing blazin' hits for Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, and many others, Kanye's work has come full circle. And while he is not as good a rapper as he is a producer, College Dropout showcases his full potential as a rap artist. <br />I must say, that while this is one of the best album released since the millenneum, I was a bit disappointed. Not by the rhymes, but by West's specialty, production. There aren't any samples quite as good as he is capable of, and that's a shame. That's not to say that it doesn't sound like a Kanye West album. Everything is there, from the high-pitched soul vocals, to the burning brass and soothing strings. I really wish that Kanye would release a greatest hits of his productions, because they rule the rap world, and every track he touches is bound to be a hit. From Twista's Overnight Celebrity to Jay-Z's H.O.V.A.(Izzo), the music is amazing. For any fan of Kanye's work, get this album. Just expect to walk away feeling like you are missing a bit.
B00006879E|5.0|This CD is awesome. Every track sounds different from the next, which is nice because then you don't get sick of listening to the CD after only 5 tracks. Adam Levine has an amazing voice and each song has great lyrics. This CD is worth every penny and I highly recommend it to anyone. You won't regret picking it up I swear!:)
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This is easily one of the best movies I've seen recently.  When it came out I didn't think it looked all that good especially having Ashton Kutcher play a non-comedic role, but I don't think that any actor could have done the job better.  Everything from the acting the flashbacks the story is great, it just goes beyond awesome.  The movie grabs you and won't let go, definetly a must see.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Okay so you know when you go buy a CD... and you listen through all the songs and you think &quot;Well that was a waste of 15 bucks&quot; because the only good song on the whole album is the one of those songs that you love but you are quickly getting sick of because its over-played on the radio.. yeah well this CD is definately NOT one of those CDs! I heard &quot;More Than Anyone&quot; on TV and I fell in love with it so I went and bought the CD and every single song on there I fell in love with. Seriously. It's not one of those CDs where you are continually skipping all the crappy tracks. I can listen through the whole entire thing and not touch the CD player. And the greatest thing about it all is that I'm still not sick of it, and let me tell you I have played that album over and over and over and I'm still crazy about it! I highly highly HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with a good music taste. I promise you, you'll love it!=D
B00029NMRW|5.0|This is probably a 4 or 41/2 star movie, but I had to give it 5 because the Whole Nine Yards is just so good.  Although the actual movie is easily a 5 star film, and even better because all of the same cast is back.  But the DVD sucks, there are no special features except for director comentary.  But other that that this is an altogether good movie.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|The Butterfly Effect (Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, 2004)<br /><br />Bress and Gruber, the scriptwriters for Final Destination 2, deliver their directorial debut with one of the worst casting decisions of all time, Ashton Kutcher (That 70's Show) in a dramatic role.<br /><br />Or so it seemed.<br /><br />Kutcher is actually one of the best things about this movie. Like Jamie Foxx in Any Given Sunday, an actor who's nauseatingly annoying in comedies gets put into a drama and shows that he does, in fact, have talent.<br /><br />The first half of the film, which despite the above doesn't feature Kutcher, is told in flashback form as we meet the main character, Evan Treborn (played variously by Kutcher, Unbreakable bit player John Patrick Amadori, and Logan Lerman of The Patriot, Riding in Cars with Boys, etc.) at three separate times in his life. He's your typical unpopular schoolkid with a very small group of friends, a similarly messed up brother and sister, Tommy (William Lee Scott/Jesse James/Cameron Bright) and Kaylee (Amy Smart/Irene Gorovaia/Sarah Widdows) Martin, and the fat kid, Lenny (Eldon Hensen/Kevin Schmidt/Jake Karese). Evan suffers from odd blackouts throughout his life, and also various other things, like the Martins' dad (played menacingly by the always-fun Eric Stoltz) being an abusive pedophile, and his own father (Callum Keith Rennie, recently in Torso, eXistenZ, and Memento) being locked up in a mental institution for suffering from the same thing Evan does.<br /><br />Let me make sure you understand this: the setup is fantastic. Everything is laid out perfectly for the massive payoff. Sure, a few things are a little too pat (Martin, for example, is stereotyped to the point of silliness), and it's obvious that they're setting you up for the massive payoff. But that makes it no less enjoyable.<br /><br />The movie, however, starts to go downhill when it snaps back to the present. It goes from being a good thriller to something of an episode of Quantum Leap. To be short, the payoff is simply not as good as the buildup was; it's as if they had this idea, worked out how to get to it, then got there and realized there was no creative energy left.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh. Some parts of the present-day storyline work just fine. They don't leave any loose ends around. Things are still a little too pat (the stereotyping of Evan's mother during one scene is so stupid it makes Eric Stoltz's character look like something out of Sartre), especially when you get to the ending (which takes the message of a popular classic film-- to say which one would give it away-- and turns it on its head), which is way too \\"man, that's the way things SHOULD have happened\\" to be anything but a cheap trick. And the idea itself is extremely interesting, and could be done far better, were anyone to come up with a good way to do it (it's been done in novels and in short form, but I don't think a feature film has ever quite pulled it off).<br /><br />All in all, some good things, some bad things. Probably worth a rental just to marvel at the idea Ashton Kutcher really can act. Lord knows we've never seen him do it before. ** ½episode of Quantum Leap.

B0002234LS|5.0|This movie kicks ass. It is very suspencefull it had me loving it from the very begining. It is one of the better movies that has come out recently by far.  For those who say it's to predictible they're lying, because there is no way anyone could have even come close to seeing the twist at the end. Either way you definetly should watch.
B0000041DZ|3.0|I find Brendel's interpritations of beethoven lacking. Basically I think it is good to the ears to hear him play, but his interpritations are very plain. This is good to listen to if you don't have a very wide understanding of Beethoven. Personally I recommend Vladimir Ashkenazy who plays the best Beethoven I have ever heard (especially in the later sonata's). You really should try listening to Ashkenazy's recordings of the Beethoven's sonatas.
038551123X|5.0|A deeply black humorous riff on the serial-killer trope and it's, well, delightful isn't exactly the work but comes close. Set mostly in Broward and also Dade counties in and around Miami, the semi-tropical urban setting is well rendered and the cop detail fascinating. A beaut of a read.  <br /> <br />
B00004WLXZ|4.0|Would suggest that Matthew Thibeault explore night courses offering remedial spelling and restrict his moronic reviews to the insipied John Wayne films he seems to fancy.
B000001GF9|4.0|The major interest of this CD is powerfull and inspired Bernstein conducting, especially choral parts of c-moll Messe and motet Ave verum corpus. Ave verum and Messe Kyrie here are the best performances I know.  <br /> The major drawback of this CD is poor, and to my mind awful, solo vocal. Soprano in Kyrie and throught Messe is unbearable; also &quot;Exsultate, jubilate&quot; is just impossible for listening due to poor vocal.  <br /> In result the pure gem of this CD is Ave verum.  <br />
B00000G3I2|5.0|I think it is a great movie with a great cast of great actors. So those of you out there who did not like it maybe it is over your head. I think it is very on the money for that generation, the only thing that is too Hollywood is the scene where the wife sets her friend up with her husband to get pregnant. That is just a little to much, in my mind I will always wonder if her husband liked it more then he is letting on, like the comment: (you don't have to be so happy). I just love the movie, I just wish we knew more about Alex then was let on.
B00008WT5M|5.0|This would be my 3rd favorite Ac/Dc album i think it is just awesome the songs on it are very very good i love &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; and &quot;Are You Ready&quot; and the song &quot;Razors Edge&quot; itself is very good all in all this album is in Ac/Dc top 5 albums of all time <br />  <br /> 1.Back In Black <br /> 2.Highway To Hell <br /> 3.High Voltage <br /> 4.Razors Edge <br /> 5.Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap <br />  <br /> the magic sorta ends after those 5 albums but Ac/Dc still remains great and every cd of theirs is worth listening too
B00005JM1F|5.0|Old School is awesome rated R entertainment. Though not all of the material is suitable for everyone, there was a target audience in mind when this was made, and they nailed a bulls-eye. This is a movie about some guys just about 10 years removed from the college scene and eventually try breaking back into that life style by setting up a unique frat house. There are some trials and tribulations that have to go on before the house can get totally set up and the movie takes you through the journey. <br /> <br />The cast was awesome, so many funny men that worked wonderfully with each other.  These guys are becoming the corner stone in the comedy movie industry these days and that couldn't make me happier.  If you love that college humor kind of comedy and are a fan of people like Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn, then this movie needs to be on your shelf. <br />
B00005B36H|5.0|While This album may be less agressive it sure doesnt hold back on quality of music this band knows how to make music hands down Tool are in my top ten favorite bands buy this album for yourself and see what is in it for you to discover i have this albuma nd love every song unfortunatly recently it got a scratch on my cd so it skips so im going to go buy another one thats how good this cd is trust me
B00008K7AM|5.0|Going into The Hot Chick, I prepared myself for a relatively bad movie, but was pleasantly surprised by a very funny movie. Rob Schneider has done a few different movies that seem like they may be the same idea with a different twist, but non the less, The Hot Chick is down right good. The plot is cheesy, a dirty dude swaps bodies with a high school hottie and you go through the movie with Rob Schneider experiencing what it is like to be a guy. <br /> <br />This is a great rental video on a rainy day and not a bad movie to own either. My parents liked it, my little cousins like it, most of my friends thought it was great so it isn't going to be a waste of your time. <br />
B00006V9A0|5.0|this is most of nirvana best hits. but they didnt add all of their best hits. they only selected a few and i was very dissapointed of that when i bought this album. and i know when everyone is reading the reviews for this album you see a lot of low stars, like 1 star or 2 stars. i looked at all the people who gave this and nirvanas other albums bad reviews and there not even punk fans. they dont diserve to post up on this or any other nirvana or punk album because there not fans and they do not know what its about.
B00005JMYG|5.0|Anchorman is another one of those delightfully silly movies that Will Ferrell takes to the next level.  Based in the 70's, Anchorman features a group of people that work for a local news station out in San Diego. The humor is more appreciated by a slightly older audience though younger viewers will laugh as well. <br /> <br />If you are into movies like Zoolander and Old School, then this is your kind of movie. Will Ferrell is awesome and gets some superb support from a bunch of funny dudes such as Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Jack Black and that girl that played Kelly Bundy. Allow yourself to love the ridiculous and you will love this movie. <br />

0684800713|5.0|Ernest Hemingway gave the world a gift in THE SUN ALSO RISES.  It is many things that are good in the literary sense and it is a highly readable novel, one of those over far too soon at 250 pages.   <br /> <br />Narrated by Jake Barnes, an American journalist living in Paris, THE SUN ALSO RISES chronicles his community of fellow ex-patriots in the 1920s.  The chief characters, besides Barnes are Bill, Robert Cohn, Mike Campbell, and Lady Brett Ashley.  That all the male characters are in love with the promiscuous Brett is just one of the tensions building as they travel to Spain for the fiesta of the running of the bulls in Pamplona.  The realistically presented bullfight yields a lesson in bull and steer herd dynamics, which becomes a metaphor for the gang's own conflicts as it steadily becomes apparent that what binds them together is the frustrating attempt to find purpose and reason in the wake of the physical and emotional devastation of wartime experience.  Hemingway employs a line spoken by Gertrude Stein in conversation as an epigram: \\"You are all a lost generation.\\" He also quotes from the first chapter of Ecclesiastes: \\"One generation passeth, and another generation commeth: but the earth abideth forever.  The sun also riseth . . .\\"   <br /> <br />In any other hands, Hemingway's story would have been so much melodrama. In his, it is comic and tragic. His story is charged with top of the craft writing.  He excels at exposition, voice, character, dialogue, setting, and style.  Symbolism sneaks in without the author having to bang the reader over the head.  What seems like so many simple declarative sentences--he did this, she said that--creates a fully dimensional literary experience.  The characters are fully drawn, representative of their time but also of universal conflicts.  That some express antisemitic sentiments that are no longer socially acceptable (though not necessarily extinguished) provides thought-provoking material for comparing generations.There is much to discuss in this book and it is far too good to avoid by capitulating to study guides. <br />
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I was not expecting this album to be so different from Mer de Noms,  probably cause Billy Howerdel did not have half of the album done before adding the rest of the band. This is quite a listen and if you look at reviews opions are really variated to what the best tracks are. They are all good songs and the album feels great as a whole, it is a journey from beginning to end, I really cant hear just one song of this album without wanting to hear them all in their order. The song that really touched me was Gravity, and I guess thats what many want in an song is to express how you feel, this one did it for me, it was an emotinal ride. 5 stars.
0156027321|5.0|Wow! This is a great, great read and one that I've given as a gift several times. Riveting from beginning to end, it is definitely hard to put down.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|When &quot;Let Go&quot; came out, I wasn't an Avril fan. She seemed way too fake for me to support so I couldn't tolerate listening to her music. The turning point was when I heard her two new singles and saw that she gained a bit more talent and has become a bit more serious regarding her musical career. <br />  <br /> Becoming a bit more rock with the help of Canadian songwriting heavyweights, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; sounds more rock than pop and helps us listeners see Avril in a better light. The singles &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; have a much more mature approach than &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8r Boi.&quot; <br />  <br /> &quot;Take Me Away&quot; is a great opening for the album, showing off a newer rock and roll sound as well as Avril's more rock vocal talent. &quot;Forgotten&quot; and &quot;He Wasn't&quot; also give the album a grittier sound. <br />  <br /> &quot;Together&quot; is one of those songs that made me change my negative view on Avril, it's so headstrong and raw that I couldn't help but become an objective reviewer once again. <br />  <br /> &quot;Forgotten&quot; is so rock compared to any other song Avril's ever done with the darker guitar riffs and Avril's bridge &quot;If only I could run away.&quot; This song gives me chills, it's that good. <br />  <br /> I honestly never thought I'd convert to an Avril Lavigne fan, and would cringe when she was being compared to Alanis Morissette (one of my favorite alternative artists,) but now I'm doing the same. Especially with the more mature lyrics and stronger approach to her vocals, Avril is starting to sound more and more like Alanis to me. <br />  <br /> It's not guaranteed that if you liked &quot;Let Go&quot; you'll like this album because it's not the typical pop punk album <br /> that is becoming increasingly more popular (New Found Glory or Yellowcard.) If you are like me and were waiting for Avril to mature a bit and pull herself away from what she calls &quot;punk,&quot; give this album a listen, you might like it.
B000089CJI|5.0|A really relaxing cd.  It has a great electronic sound like a good techno song minus the ridiculous amount of bass and has great vocals.
B00008DDRX|5.0|As i began watching this film, it became clear that this movie was a very visual thinking film.  It used imagery rather than spoken words arranged in a sentence to communicate the storyline.  Me, as a designer/artist, am a very visual thinker.  So watching this movie was very refreshing, plus the car sequences are amazing, especially the few crash scenes. Awesome film...
B0000027RL|5.0|I had a great time at PJ show ,(Regal theater,Chicago), and feel like I owe them at least this:  A classic. At least three songs for the ages,  a -strong- band, and a charismatic singer. Has already stood the test of time.
B000055ZB8|1.0|WHY OH WHY did Kino chose to use 2 equally horrendous Synthesizer tracks for the background of this beautiful amazing inspiring film?

B0001FR3IG|4.0|Wow! &quot;Gothika&quot; is a real spooky suspense thriller in the best gothic, B movie tradition - with ghosts, no less. It's a dark rainy night, thunder rumbles and lightning flashes, illuminating a state prison for the criminally insane, which looks more like Dracula's Transylvanian castle than a mental institution for women. Director Mathieu Kassovitz gives us damsels in distress, along with paranormal activity and something...or someone very evil...lurking. Brrrrr. Ok, so Kassovitz uses so many horror cliches the movie becomes campy - but it is better than most scary films I have seen recently, and it is certainly entertaining.<br /><br /> Halle Berry plays respected psychiatrist Miranda Grey, who works at the above prison. Her husband, (Charles S. Dutton), also a psychiatrist, runs the place. While driving home one dark, rainy night, (wherever this city is, the sun doesn't shine much), she is forced to take an out-of-the-way detour. She sees a young woman, bruised and partially clothed, standing in the middle of the isolated road and swerves to miss hitting her. Dr. Grey gets out of the car to assist the girl and then the real weirdness begins. Miranda wakes up three days later in the same institution where she works, but she is in a hospital gown, locked in a cell - a prisoner, not a doctor - and accused of the violent murder of her husband. She has amnesia and remembers nothing after seeing the girl in the rain. Her fingerprints are all over the murder weapon, her bloodyhand prints are on the wall, along with the written words &quot;NOT ALONE,&quot; and the murder weapon is covered with her prints also. Could this rational, professional woman who loved her husband have murdered him? No matter what other reviewers say, I had fun watching this flick - and was even scared, at times. I'm a pretty good sleuth too, and I didn't catch on for a while.<br /><br /> There is overacting here....and some under-acting too. As a screamer, Hallie doesn't disappoint - but it's a scary movie, right? Penelope Cruz plays Chloe, one of Miranda's disturbed patients who becomes a fellow inmate. She has few lines of note, and what lines she has are barely audible. Robert Downey, Jr. plays Miranda's colleague Dr Pete Graham, who definitely listened to her more before she became a patient. The script bogs down at times and becomes a bit muddled. However, I would recommend &quot;Gothika&quot; as light entertainment for a dark rainy night when you might be in the mood for a fright.<br /><br /> JANAbut it's a scary movie, right?

B0001HAITK|3.0|This movie did not live up to my expectations. It was a bit too childish for my taste. Jeremy Sumpter is at best a mediocre actor. I know it must be challenging to bring a &quot;forever young&quot; character like Peter Pan, and Jeremy did his best, but at times it seemed as though he was acting like a 7-year-old child (i.e. His views on discipling the children for almost killing Wendy). Rachel Hurd-Wood annoyed me terribly as Wendy, acting like a fragile little girl who couldn't think for herself. That might be how Wendy was supposed to be, but if so, Rachel took it to an extreme. All in all, the casting for the child actors was unsastifactory. <br /> The adult acting was much better. Jason Isaacs salvaged the movie as Hook. He was every bit the villain always portrayed-but with a twist. He did seem to be, in the words of Wendy, &quot;a man of feelings.&quot; When Hook met his doom at the end, I did not feel jubilance at the fact that the children could now escape. I was actually regretted the fact that Hook was gone (and the fact that Tinkerbell did not succeed in getting rid of Wendy, but that's a diffent story). <br /> This was a movie obviously directed at children. I, being an adolescent, did not enjoy it as much. The visual effects were spectacular, and there were laughs to be had, but I might have enjoyed it more had I been a few years younger.
B000002GXX|5.0|If HOTEL CALIFORNIA ranks amongst Rock's greatest albums, how can ONE OF THESE NIGHTS surpass it? I'm beginning to think of ONE OF THESE NIGHTS as a better Eagles album, it represents the variety of styles the band had mastered, and if it doesn't contain as many core classics, it has just as many great songs. The album, produced by Bill Szymczyk, was able to blend country background, pop sensibilities, and rock ambitions into a cohesive collection. The lineup on the record was Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon (his last album with the band), Randy Meisner, and Don Felder. The title track, which opened the album, served as a jumping off point. &quot;One Of These Nights&quot; was a #1 hit, though the song was different from their previous records, with a significant R&B influence, and falsetto harmonies on the chorus. Don Henley took the lead vocal on this classic recording and the song was written by Henley and Frey. &quot;Too Many Hands&quot; was an aggressive rock song, written by Meisner and Felder and featuring Randy Meisner on lead vocals. The song was a continuation of the rock sound which broke out on ON THE BORDER. The Leadon/Leadon/Henley/Frey collaboration, &quot;Hollywood Waltz&quot; is probably my favorite song on the album (with &quot;Lyin' Eyes&quot; a close second). The song is a beautiful mid-tempo country ballad, sung by Don Henley, with a great chorus, and the incredible sound of the mandolin, steel, harmonium, and synthesizer coming together in the closing instrumental section. A winning track all the way. Bernie Leadon's &quot;Journey Of The Sorcerer&quot; is a fascinating instrumental which clocks in well over six and a half minutes. The song does hold my attention, it was used as the theme song to THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, and some critics hold it in a similar esteem to the album's hits. &quot;Lyin' Eyes&quot; is one of those hits, written by Henley and Frey, and ranks as my favorite Eagles song (even if &quot;Hollywood Waltz&quot; gets that nod on this album). Sung by Glenn Frey, &quot;Lyin' Eyes&quot; is a country-rock staple, it represents the Eagles success at polishing the merger of country and rock into a sound that pleased the record buying public. It could be a signiture piece of the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; sound (a genre distinction represented by the Eagles, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie Raitt, Fleetwood Mac, Warren Zevon). It has an inviting melody, terrific lyrics, and is just an outright enjoyable piece of music. It also earned the band their first Grammy for Best Pop Performance By A Group. &quot;Take It To The Limit&quot; is Randy Meisner's most famous lead vocal with the Eagles, a beautiful, dynamic ballad that brims with energy from the first notes to the closing ones. The song details an almost signiture lyrical ideal, sort of desperately restless, which is found throughout several Eagles songs and the basis of HOTEL CALIFORNIA. Meisner, Henley, and Frey collaborated on this gorgeous classic. &quot;Visions&quot; is another crashing rock number, and Don Felder's first lead vocal with the band, written by Felder and Henley. &quot;One Of These Nights,&quot; &quot;Lyin' Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Take It To The Limit&quot; were the big hits of ONE OF THESE NIGHTS, but &quot;After The Thrill Is Gone&quot; became another favorite after it was used to fill out GREATEST HITS VOLUME 2. The song is another stunning ballad, with author Glenn Frey taking the lead vocal on the verses, and author Don Henley taking lead on the bridges. The verses convey an almost wistful tone, they set the mood, and the song's title is repeated at the end of the verses, when the bridges come in (two different ones) they change the entire effect of the song. &quot;After The Thrill Is Gone&quot; is an impressive performance, and makes an excellent addition to both this album and the greatest hits compilations (its on THE VERY BEST OF THE EAGLES (2003) as well). While that song could have easily closedthe album, &quot;I Wish You Peace&quot; bring the record to a perfect finish. Bernie Leadon and Patti Davis wrote the gentle ballad, which features Bernie Leadon singing of good wishes, bringing a nice resolution to the Eagles most diverse album. ONE OF THESE NIGHTS was the band's first #1 album, and represented a huge jump in commercial success. Given the great songs, terrific performances, and amazing command of different styles and types of music, its definitely well-deserved success. All the Eagles studio albums are worth checking out eventually, but ONE OF THESE NIGHTS is the high point in the Eagles catalog, and is a must.
B00001PE4D|4.0|Cruel Intentions is one of those movies that will forever be associated for me with high school, which certainly sets the tone for this updated version of Les Liasions Dangeruese. It is at times witty, satrical and most of all sex-charged. Neveretheless, sex is the prime subject of the movie and as it was even in the classic novel so it obviously cannot be omitted and honestly, the movie would have suffered if it had. <br /> <br />Sarah Michelle Gellar gives a fantastic performance as Kathryn, the rich drug addict of the Upper West Side. She gives the stand-out performance in this film and is a nice change from her good-girl image of Buffy and Scooby-Doo. Phillippe pretty much plays himself, brooding and whiny, and Witherspoon does the same, playing a cheerful, bright, not-to-be-taken-advantage-of young woman. <br /> <br />This movie falls way above the mark when it comes to typical teen drama movies. Whether that's because of the classic plot or the acting is your call, but remember it is a teen movie and not on par with its older, far superior counterpart, 1988's Les Liasons Dangereuse.
0609610570|5.0|What's left to say about this book on execution? With 130 online reviews many issues are covered already. One point's missing, though. Look at the reviews; they are divided into two camps. The reviewers either think this is a mediocre book with very basic ideas (management 101) or they see the light. The latter realize that there's no need for new acronyms or faddy words in the management-speak. \\"Execution\\" is about getting things done, being persistent and realistic, as well as managing the 3 core processes; strategy (why? and what?), operations (how?) and people (who?).      Building a performance culture is never as easy as it sounds. Looking back a few years, try to recall a few of those companies with great media attention and grand strategic visions. Many of them failed. And many of them will fail again and again, because the heroes are strategic visionaries that never bothered to deal with the issue of execution; continually and personally making sure that things were actually done. You know, when all is said and done, usually more is said than done...      If you found this book fascinating, you'll probably have some of the execution traits hidden in your personality preferences. If you want to check it out, you might visit some of free Internet sites for a test (e.g. keirsey.com). For a business, I believe it's paramount to make sure that you have a well-balanced team on all levels in the hierarchy. This also includes having enough executives with execution traits. Advice: Don't assume you have it; test it!      Conclusively, this is a great book. I liked it so much that I even also bought the audio version! The reason for the audio version is that these execution ideas simply are needed to be absorbed over several readings (or listenings). Otherwise, you won't be able to start changing your behavior (which you can change, unlike your innate preferences). While commuting, I often turn the CDs on and find it inspiring to forget about traffic jams and just getting the views of Charan and Bossidy in their own voices. However, I do agree that the book easily could have been shorter.     Peter Leerskov,   MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This new musical from Stephen Schwartz is a mixture of delights. From the music to the lyrics to the dynamic personalities of Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good Witch of the North who come alive through Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, Wicked is a superb show that cannot be missed.  <br />  <br /> The two leading ladies are without a doubt the show's driving force. Each of them lend their vocal talents to their characters and create personalities for them that are perfect. Chenoweth mimicks Glinda from the movie so well in the opening number that you could truly believe that she played the role on screen. Menzel gives a spectacular performance of Elphaba and her numbers are truly show-stopping. Both of their two main numbers, &quot;Popular&quot; for Glinda and &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; for Elphaba, as well as the closer &quot;For Good&quot; are fantastically performed and recorded. <br />  <br /> It should be noted that the musical differs quite a bit from McDonough's book upon which the show is based so do not listen to the album expecting the storyline to mimic the book. And while this is certainly inspired from a children's story, it might not necessarily be for younger children since some of the themes of love, betrayl and loyalty are aimed for an older crowd. <br />  <br /> A delightful show that should be enjoyed by all!!
B000002LGQ|5.0|The album was great, but i hope a digitally remastered version will also be released soon by Warner, just like the first three albums that also had two bonus remixed tracks. For this album, an extended version of Like A prayer, Cherish, or Express Your Self would be excellent!
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Doubtless the argument will rage over the years as to which is Adam's best work. My personal favourite will always be Gold. Each of his albums has something different to offer; whether it's the country-tinged melancholy of Heartbreaker, the 80's infused rock of Rock and Roll, or the intimate acoustic musings of recent effort Love Is Hell. <br />However, there is no better display of Ryan Adam's versatility and song writing genius than this album. From the opening joy of New York New York, to the heart-wrenching Goodnight Hollywood Boulevard, Adams deftly jumps across musical genres- blues, folk, country, rock, piano and acoustic based ballads- they're all here. People argue that this album sounds too commercial- I'm sorry, but that's exactly what makes it so great. Adams has never sung better than this and every song is mixed to perfection; he has recently taken to producing his own albums, a mistake in my mind, as he has never been more instantly accessible than this. <br />Not that there isn't a lot to discover in Gold. Some of the best tracks are the ones that don't necessarily jump out at you in the first place. New York New York, Firecracker, and Answering Bell are all instant hits, but the likes of Wild Flowers and Sylvia Plath have an underlying beauty that tug at the heart strings more and more on every listen. The latter depicts Adam's dream of being the lover of a woman ultimately destined for tragedy. This echoes the earlier theme of Firecracker; Adams, it seems, is someone who would rather burn brighter than longer. <br />This probably also explains his apparent song writing obsession with prostitutes. The final two tracks are obviously based on this theme, although most of the tracks can be related to them in some tenuous way. Before outraged Adams fans berate me, try listening to the entire album again with this in mind- you'll be surprised. Latter albums also return to this theme (Hallelujah on Demolition for example). Coupled with his other tracks lamenting failed relationships, it paints Adams as rather sorry fellow; a travelling minstrel destined for one-night flings and never quite hanging onto to anything deeper. <br />In short, Gold will broaden your musical horizons. Since buying this album three years ago, I've found myself listening to more country, folk and blues- although it's difficult to find something as honest and accessible as this. If you're new to Ryan Adams, this is the best place to start- and it may be all you need.
B00004W55E|5.0|The best tracks on this CD in my opinion are 'I Forgive You&quot; & &quot;I Can Explain&quot;. I will not be able to describe the vocal prowess and utter talent that exudes from this womans' brains, throat, fingers and toenails when I here her sing these two songs. Ms. Ferrell sings extremely well. She is what most would like to be....A VOCALIST! If you have never heard her sing, make sure you purchase this CD. She is smooth, mellow, funky, soulful and sweet.  <br />  <br /> I will get the opportunity to witness &quot;The Voice&quot; in person in NYC tomorrow. I do not care what she sings ....as long as she sings &quot;I Can Explain&quot; !!!! I LOVE HER!!!  <br />  <br /> BUY THIS CD, DAMN IT!! :)
B0000033P0|4.0|Tarkus(1971). Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Second Album.<br /><br /> After the Top 5 success of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Eponymous debut, they hit the studios to create their most daring work, 'Tarkus'. The entire first half of 'Tarkus' is made up of the 21 Minute Title Track, a Progressive Rock masterpiece that still stands as one of the Top 10 of all-time, and for good reason. 'Tarkus' features the immense vocal and guitar talents of Greg Lake, the illustrous drumming of Carl Palmer, and the massive keyboard/synthesizer talents of Keith Emerson, so Emerson, Lake, and Palmer was set to rock the world. Upon its release, 'Tarkus' debuted at #1 in the U.K., and rose to the Top 5 in the US, going Multi-Platinum even without a hit single. So, is 'Tarkus' an overblown album only worth the title track, or an overall excellent album? Read on to find out!<br /><br /> Track Ratings-<br /><br /> Tarkus- \\"Tarkus\\" is a sprawling, epic, progressive masterpiece, and I will be rating it by its subdivsions.<br /><br /> A) Eruption- \\"Eruption\\" is a Psychadelic Rocker in which Keith Emerson flexes his Keyboarding and Synthesizer talents. Think of a Doors Instrumental!<br /><br /> B)Stones Of Years- \\"Stones Of Years\\" seamlessly flows Lake's phenomenal vocals into the equation, while keeping the backup keyboards. Emerson once again shows us his talents on an organ, yet this is more jazzy than psychadelic.<br /><br /> C) Iconclast- \\"Iconclast\\" starts off almost frantically, with fever-pitch drumming from Palmer, and Emerson casually blends Organs, Keyboards, and Synthesizers.<br /><br /> D)Mass- \\"Mass\\" FINALLY adds in Lake's guitar along with his soaring vocals, but Emerson quickly takes over with a phenomenal organ solo, greatly helped by frequent e;ectric bursts from Lake's guitar and INSANE drumming from Palmer. This section also fleshes out the story more, with Lake's vocals putting out excellent lyrics.<br /><br /> E) Manticore- \\"Manticore\\" starts off mostly as a drum solo, with slight touches of Emerson's synthesizer, and it continues on to become an almost Psychadelic Drum Solo with slight organ interplay.<br /><br /> F) Battlefield- \\"Battlefield\\" echoes to The Doors, as Lake's foreboding vocals are frequently interspersed between Emerson's organ and keyboard solos, and Lake actually plays a large amount of guitar, as Emerson takes a seat for Lake. Excellent example of Classic Rock!<br /><br /> G)Aquatarkus- \\"Aquatarkus\\" shows that the good guys prevailed against tarkus, so Emerson's Synthesizer solo almost sounds like a victory song, and the listener feels like throwing their fist into the air! \\"Tarkus\\" ends with a more Pink Floyd feel, with odd sounds like gongs, and interplay between Emerson's synthesizer and organ. \\"Tarkus\\" is a Progressive Masterpiece, and quite frankly, is worth the price of the album alone. 5 stars easily!<br /><br /> Jeremy Bender- \\"Jeremy Bender\\" finds Keith Emerson using a piano technique not unlike the Old West pianists in bars, and Lake's happy, upbeat vocals make this short song a fun, almost Old Western rocker!<br /><br /> Bitches Crystal- \\"Bitches Crystal\\" is almost undescribeable, but it finds Lake belting out funny lyrics behind Emerson's unrelenting keyboard, along with frequent dark(as in, not happy) outbursts from the synthesizer. An odd, fun rocker.<br /><br /> The Only Way(Hymn)- \\"The Only Way(Hymn)\\" starts off like a church song, with Emerson's organ playing, but suddenly it gets very dark, and Lake's symphonic, yet oddly remorseful vocals and lyrics come in. Soon the song goes in a new direction, with Emerson breaking loose on the keyboard, and Lake singing happy, light vocals to end this Keyboarding Ballad.<br /><br /> Infinite Place(Conclusion)- \\"Infinite Place(Conclusion)\\" starts off like usual, with Emerson breaking into a keyboard solo, starting off slow but picking up the pace to a frenzy before settling down again to mold an all-keyboard Jazzy Instrumental.<br /><br /> A Time And A Place- \\"ATime And A Place\\" starts off loudly, with Emerson's deep, almost bassy keyboard notes backing up Lake's screaming, almost pleading vocals. A very moody, and heavy, melodic keyboard Rocker!<br /><br /> Are You Ready Eddy?- \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\" shows ELP throwing away all their Progressive elements and sitting back and belting out some 50's Rock, very much like Buddy Holly. \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\" is a fun rocker, that in all my dreams, I'd never expect Emerson, Lake, and Palmer to do!<br /><br /> Overall, 'Tarkus' is a step up from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's debut, but I still think they have a ways to go. As many reviewers have mentioned, after the magnificent 'Tarkus', the other songs seem a little bit mediocre in comparison, and although they aren't bad tracks, they're unfortuneatly right. Also, I'm happy Greg Lake got more time for singing, yet his guitar talents should be fleshed out more than 1 or 2 solos on \\"Tarkus\\". On the Good Side, Keith Emerson sounds better than on the debut, as he's introduced Organs and Synthesizers to the mix, while still keeping the familar keyboard.<br /><br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF PROGRESSIVE ROCK, EMERSON, LAKE, AND PALMER, CLASSIC ROCK, AND FANS OF CLASSICAL PIANO. \\"TARKUS\\" IS WORTH THE PURCHASE ALONE, TRUST ME!<br /><br /> Killer Kuts- \\"Tarkus\\"<br /><br /> Also Recommended-<br /><br /> Brain Salad Surgery- Emerson, Lake, and Palmer<br /><br /> In The Court of King Crimson- King Crimson<br /><br /> The Doors- The Doors<br /><br /> Thanks For Reading!e usual, with Emerson breaking into a keyboard solo, starting off slow but picking up the pace to a frenzy before settling down again to mold an all-keyboard Jazzy Instrumental. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> A Time And A Place- \\"A Time And A Place\\" starts off loudly, with Emerson's deep, almost bassy keyboard notes backing up Lake's screaming, almost pleading vocals.

B0000931QA|5.0|Operation: Mindcrime(1988). Queensryche's Fourth Album.<br /><br /> After the releases of 'Rage For Order' and 'The Warning', Queensryche headed back to the studios to create what would soon become their masterwork, 'Operation: Mindcrime'. Hiring Todd Rungedren(of Rush fame), Geoff Tate envisioned a concept album, based around the story of a fortune hunter whose disillusionment with Reagan-era American society leads him to join a shadowy plot to assassinate corrupt leaders. Unlike their previous two records, Queensryche decided to use a more Prog Metal approach, with their main influence being Iron Maiden. 'Operation: Mindcrime' is a gritty, dark, and haunting album, and it works well with Noir Films or 'Goodfellas'. Upon its release, 'Operation: Mindcrime' breached the Top 40, and it eventually stayed on the charts for over a year, certifying it Platinum. While no hit singles emerged, &quot;Eyes Of A Stranger&quot; received fair airplay from MTV, and it would set the stage for the breakout success of 'Empire' and the single &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot;. So, is 'Operation: Mindcrime' an over-ambitious concept album, or a beautiful Prog Metal Masterpiece? Read on to find out!<br /><br /> Track Ratings-<br /><br /> I Remember Now- &quot;I Remember Now&quot; introduces you to our main character.<br /><br /> Anarchy X- &quot;Anarchy X&quot; is a short-lived intro to &quot;Revolution Calling&quot;, but for an instrumental, the feeling of revolt and the excellent guitar solo make this a superb track!<br /><br /> Revolution Calling- &quot;Revolution Calling&quot; takes over from &quot;Anarchy X&quot;, slowing down for an intense buildup, where 'Ryche's chugging guitar molds into Tate's sarcastic vocals, which fully bloom in the excellent chorus, which will have you banging your head undoubtedly! An awesome Heavy Metal rocker that makes you want to revolt!<br /><br /> Operation: Mindcrime- &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot; presents itself as a dark and haunting look at the Goverment's deception, and Degarmo/Wilton's(I will refer to them as &quot;The Duo&quot; henceforth) doomy riff behind Tate's sadistic vocals, not to mention a killer chorus and solo(s) make the title track and excellent Prog Rocker!<br /><br /> Speak- &quot;Speak&quot; starts off with &quot;The Duo&quot;'s duel guitar attack, and it builds up to Tate's vocals, which are obviously trying to sound like Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson. A dark, melodic, Heavy Metal masterpiece, with absolutely stunning lyrics and musicianship!<br /><br /> Spreading The Disease- NOT THE ANTHRAX SONG! &quot;Spreading The Disease&quot; is a scathing look at the media, and the pessimistic vocals and lyrics show why. &quot;The Duo&quot;'s guitarwork is surprisingly harmonic and upbeat, which properly complement the song's dark undertones. Bliss!<br /><br /> The Mission- &quot;The Mission&quot; is a ballad along the lines of Metallica's &quot;Fade To Black&quot;, with somber, moving vocals courtesy Tate and a innocent guitar riff, but it picks up midway through, and gets heavier towards the end after a beautiful guitar solo. I'm Lovin' It!<br /><br /> Suite Sister Mary- &quot;Suite Sister Mary&quot; is &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot;'s epic, a 10 minute long Prog Rock masterpiece that goes from heavy to slow, almost in a heartbeat. Throughout, Tate's creepy vocals, haunting monks' chanting, and a sinister(but slow) guitar riff enthrall the listener the entire way through!<br /><br /> The Needle Lies- &quot;The Needle Lies&quot; echoes back to Judas Priest influences, with &quot;The Duo&quot;'s duel guitar attack and Tate's Halford-esque vocals warning all that 'the needle lies' throughout. Magnificent interplay between &quot;The Duo&quot; makes &quot;The Needle Lies&quot; a dark, heavy rocker in the vein of classic Judas Priest.<br /><br /> Electric Requeium- A REALLY dark, scary, filler track that would fit well with murdering your best friend. A frightening track with an excellent guitar solo!<br /><br /> Breaking The Silence- &quot;Breaking The Silence&quot; is Queensryche at their most Glam/Hair Metal, and the end result sounds a little something like Dokken. &quot;The Duo&quot;'s chugging guitar riff and Tate's light, optimistic vocals truly build up to the stellar Glam Metal-y chorus, which, unless you're dead, will having you banging your head!<br /><br /> I Don't Believe In Love- &quot;I Don't Believe In Love&quot; is a Power Metal Ballad, much like fellow rockers The Scorpions did. &quot;The Duo&quot;'s light, easy-going riff and Tate's moody vocals truly stand out when they pick up for the addictive chorus, where each shows a flair that only the 'Ryche can get! Excellent solo, excellent song!<br /><br /> Waiting For 22- A Touching filler track, much like Randy Rhoad's &quot;Dee&quot;, with a short but sweet guitar solo.<br /><br /> My Empty Room- An intro to &quot;Eyes Of A Stranger&quot;.<br /><br /> Eyes Of A Stranger- &quot;Eyes Of A Stranger&quot; blossoms from the start with a killer guitar solo, but soon turns into a ballad featuring beautiful, symphonic vocals from Tate. &quot;Eyes Of A Stranger&quot; is a magnificent Power Metal Ballad, featuring an addictive chorus and magnificent guitarwork.<br /><br /> Recently in 2003, Queensryche's catalogue was remastered, featuring 24 Bit Digital Sound and Extra Tracks! On 'Operation: Mindcrime&quot;, you get to Live takes on &quot;The Mission&quot; and &quot;My Empty Room&quot;, and they both never fail to amaze! This is just icing on the cake!<br /><br /> Overall, 'Operation: Mindcrime&quot; is much more than I expected, and definitely now is one of my favorite CDs. I can't stress enough how well &quot;The Duo&quot;'s amazing duel guitar attack and solos work, being beautiful, symphonic, and far-reaching at the same time, much like Geoff Tate's vocals. I LOVED EVERY TRACK, and even the filler was a good listen! Progressive and Heavy Metal never sounded better!<br /><br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! A MAGNIFICENT CD FOR FANS OF HEAVY METAL, PROGRESSIVE ROCK, AND QUEENSRYCHE!

B000002U82|5.0|Unless you have lived in a dark cave, feeding off moss for the last thirty years, you know who Pink Floyd is and their most notable album, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". I'm sure everyone on the planet, and maybe even some who are not on the planet, have heard \\"Time\\", \\"Money\\" and \\"Us and Them\\". This was a very transitional album for the Floyd, separating their career into before the Dark Side and after. Their pre-Dark Side music was more raw, more psychedelic. Where with the release of Dark Side they became refined, masters of the overdub, and gave attention to every little detail. Dark Side was really the first album of its kind, which may explain its popularity causing it to soar the charts for so very long. Dark Side was the boost to push rock to the next level, opening a whole new sound to musicians and listeners alike. For being more than thirty years old, Dark Side still sounds fresh and new to this day. A timeless classic indeed.
B00005JMXX|5.0|My expectations were like zero, I knew that the makers of this movie were the ones behind Independence Day - so I was positively surprised, it's plane entertainment, sometimes very stupid, and a typicall American movie (no offence) - but it's done well, it looks real, and it's never boring (I think) - even the acting is mostly ok, barable at least - and there are many exitment-factors in this movie - much better than Will Smith and the stupid effect-movie Independence Day, that one failed to show nerve, as the MOST American movie I've ever suffered myself through - in other words; The Day After Tomorrow is an improvement. If you expect no more and no less of a movie of this kind than I did - so enjoy!
0679720200|4.0|<br />Mersault is an existential person; he goes to work each day, comes home each evening, stops when something stops him, and goes along with events that cross his path.  At what point does this turn to nihilism, and more importantly, at what point do we stop thinking of his actions as a philosophy and begin to judge them or him? <br /> <br />Mersault is complicit when his neighbor asks him to compose a letter to exact revenge on a woman whom the neighbor says did him wrong.  Vengeance seems an appropriate reaction to Mersault, so he writes the letter.  Subsequently he hears its result through his wall: the woman arrives, and the neighbor beats her.  Another neighbor abuses his dog, Mersault tells us.  He doesn't intervene nor form a judgment.  Marie asks him, \\"Do you love me?\\"  Mersault replies that it doesn't have much meaning, but he doesn't think so.  He then agrees to marry her when she asks.  Our first neighbor, rumored to be a pimp, who has beaten a woman, invites Mersault on a trip.  Sure, he'll go.  He goes where the tide takes him. <br /> <br />On this trip, the `thugs' behind the event with the woman arrive.  While alone on the beach, unprovoked, Mersualt shoots one of them - once, then four more times.  Why?  He was not asked to nor provoked; in his mind he was, in short, being himself, though he has a hard time articulating this as a courtroom defense.  <br /> <br />The prosecution shows Mersault as an unfeeling callous person who premeditatedly murdered.  He didn't pre-plan; we know this of Mersault.  He did commit homicide, unprovoked.  Now we have societal questions: is his personality, or philosophy of life, relevant?  Does his past behavior, that one could interpret as callous, have anything to do with murder?  No tears at mother's funeral, behaving in concert with a man in a manner that results in harm, then befriending the man and taking the fateful trip with him.  Legally (another topic entirely), no.  The event on its own and his defense, ashe sees it: is it valid or is there a point when one has the \\"right\\" to judge another?  If the other's actions do harm--murder--what should we do? <br /> <br />Mersault is Mersault.  Camus places this existential character in the most questionable circumstance.  His personality caused the death of another person.  And that's the book.  Mersault has thoughts and opinions; not many, so he doesn't speak much, but he knows who he is and is never dishonest about it.  The back cover of the edition of the book I hold tells me Mersault is a victim.  Is this true?  Or is there not an answer to that question?  What does society do when someone commits murder for no reason other than he is who he is?  The penal system (another different topic) is atrocious - but that isn't what the book is about.  So if an existential, easy going life leads to behavior that is complicit in events that hurt or kill others, do we switch the \\"ism\\" to a judgmental word - in the book, amorality (his atheism plays role as well in others' judgment of Mersault); in psychology, unsafe to others; in culture, a threat to society.   <br /> <br />In my opinion the book asks us to think about these questions and answers.  Perhaps it gives us its answers but, more importantly, it is to us to think of them.  When is existentialism nihilism, and when is nihilism `wrong' and what should, if anything, society do about it?  I personally found Mersualt 'strange' at the start, then uncaring about the ills of others, and finally a murderer, which, to me, is a horrid thing regardless of the philosophy that led him there.  I found him interesting, but I can not condone his actions.  However, I think the point is more that Camus gave us this extreme example as a demonstration, and I think that's what to walk away with. <br /> <br />Last, I loved and admired the way the first few sentences, which are brilliant, come back later to tie the entire book together.  A short, simply stated book extraordinarily well-handed tous as food for great thought. <br />
B00000G3PA|2.0|What have Clint Eastwood, Chuck Norris, Charles Bronson and dearest Bruce Willis in common? Only on expression on their rich and talented actor-faces - and you just have to envy Bruce: how many times did he save the world now? Was it 50? I liked Bruce in just one, ONE, of his many films - Sixth Sence, he actually did a good &quot;face&quot; there - and up to recently, for some reason I just can't find, he has been offered many great film-deals - and I'm sure he was paid &quot;ok&quot; for Armageddon too, no doubt - Willis is a man I find hard to see as the big actor-star that he actually is, compare him to Sean Penn, Robert De Niro... Well, this is my opinion on him as one of the highest paid actors today anyway, I'm sure he's a nice guy - but I found both he and this movie a total waste of screen+seats in the cinemas around the world - will not ever watch it again - and Ben Affleck doesn't exactly tempt me there either...
B000003TA4|4.0|The songs on this cd are good and some are great: come as you are, breed (for its pure rawness), and lithium alone make this cd worth buying. It gets boring after a while but the first time you hear it you can understand why some people think its great.  The fact that Kurt Cobain is a junkie and an idiot, and that the music is simple (not bad), doesn't change the fact that its good. A good solid buy for anyone who is into music.
B00006879E|5.0|I heard Harder to Breathe on the radio and it's a really catchy pop tune so I decided to buy the CD even though I'm not much of a pop fan.  Well I was pleasantly surprised that most of the rest of Maroon 5's are more soft and mellow, almost a little R&B and it's quite refreshing.  They have great music and clever lyrics and I definitely recommend this band.
B00001U03Q|4.0|This is an excellent compilation, but I think the last 4 songs are not worth being in this cd. More like filler material. Nevertheless, it's got some memorable tracks.
0385512104|5.0|I was amazed and absolutely hooked by this book. Simply written in a matter of fact tone and no frills it is a book that draws you into the mind and life of the character. This should be on the reading list for anyone from an older teenager on up. I won't go over the story line but suffice it to say it is a marvellous story and you will never look at an autistic child or his family the same way after reading this book.
0553573403|3.0|In character development and in presenting the details of an alternative civilization, this book ranks among the best. The integrated detail of the characters' lives and the intrigues are also among the best. The readability of this book is excellent.<br /><br />So, why have I rated it with three stars? With fear that I'll be viewed as somewhat prudish, the author over uses sex. Often the sexual references are simply gratuitous. When necessary, i.e., actually a part of the story line, the sex is unnecessarily emphasized.
B000000P11|5.0|Strange Times is the first album I heard by The Chameleons.  I liked it so much, I ended up buying three more albums by the Chameleons that same month. They are all great.  I cannot believe that I never heard of them before recently.
630512762X|1.0|This movie was a first for me. After 15 minutes, I turned the VCR off, returned the video to the store, and never looked back. I can count on one hand the number of movies I have ever stopped watching before the end. This one has the dubious honor of being the one requiring the fewest minutes of viewing to conclude that I was completely wasting my time. And, no I do not hate all action movies, nor do I have anything against John Travolta or Nicholas Cage. This was just so bad from the beginning that I couldn't suffer through the whole thing.
B000286S8S|1.0|O.K. Let's be REAL honest. Yes,this is a decent compilation. Yes you get all the greats here. Yes,it's missing a few here and there (but they are not going to put everything on there right??Because then you won't go out and buy all the other albums if you haven't already)But they WILL get you to buy the same material over and over again as this double disc clearly displays. <br />  <br /> TRUTH BE KNOWN...WE &quot;DESERVED&quot; A VAN HALEN: BEST OF VOLUME 2 !!! <br /> Every fan ran out to by Volume 1 in '96 that featured the two new David Lee Roth tracks. It would have been pefect to have a Volume 2 all these years later with Sammy back at the helm to compliment that first edition. BUT NO!!!  <br />  <br /> You want a worth wild track list for a BEST OF VOLUME 2 mix (that is keeping the tradition of VOLUME 1) Here it is: <br /> 1. YOU REALLY GOT ME <br /> 2. JAMIES CRYIN' <br /> 3. FEEL YOUR LOVE TONIGHT (or even I'M THE ONE) <br /> 4. SOMEBODY GET ME A DOCTOR (if you prefer BEAUTIFUL GIRLS fine) <br /> 5. EVERYBODY WANTS SOME!! <br /> 6. MEAN STREET <br /> 7. LITTLE GUITARS (or if you love the covers PRETTY WOMAN,or DANCING IN THE STREET) <br /> 8. HOT FOR TEACHER <br /> 9. I'LL WAIT <br /> 10. BEST OF BOTH WORLDS <br /> 11. LOVE WALKS IN <br /> 12. FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED (or FEELS SO GOOD or CABO WABO, but this was the hit) <br /> 13. RUNAROUND <br /> 14. TOP OF THE WORLD <br /> 15. NOT ENOUGH <br /> 16. WITHOUT YOU (should at least give Gary one track!) <br /> 17. IT'S ABOUT TIME (new track) <br /> 18. UP FOR BREAKFAST (new track) <br /> 19. LEARNING TO SEE (new track) <br />  <br /> One final message to the real VH fans,borrow this double disc from somebody just for the 3 new tracks and make your own BEST OF VOLUME 2,which is what the real VH fams deserved. Not getting ripped off for all the same material again! You probably have all the original albums,therefor been putting money in the VH boys pockets for years. ITS' ABOUT TIME you didn't! <br />  <br />
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I'm fairly new to these guys, but I gotta say... I am f*cking IMPRESSED!! &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot; is everything I had hoped for from Killswitch Engage's last album, and then some! KSE's Adam Dutkiewicz lends his talents with some excellent production and arrangement. Unearth seems to draw elements from everywhere, from the brutal hardcore breakdowns of bands like &quot;Blood Has Been Shed&quot; to the string punishing melodic riffs of early &quot;In Flames&quot;. Nu-metal this is NOT. One can find some killer guitar solos, as on the track &quot;Zombie Autopilot&quot;, something even the old school metal bands are running away from in droves. Any fan of hardcore and/or melodic death metal will absolutely enjoy this album. You CANNOT call yourself a fan of metal and not own &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot;.
0060512806|5.0|I have been saying this (woe to hyse) outloud for over a year now and still get a kick out of it (read it-you'll get it).  So much so that I am re-reading the novel. Before derailing into incomprehensible semi pretentious litterary babble (see Quicksilver &amp; co.), Stephenson created a gem with Cryptonomicon.<BR>The style is a notch away (above?)  from mainstreem thrillers. The digressions are hilarious. The observations keen. The humour witty and tongue in cheek. The history informative. The breeziest 1200 page read ever. Does with words what Bach did with notes.<BR>All in all a terrific effort worth all the praise it has garnered.<BR>Woe to Hyse!
B00005JLRT|3.0|At best, \\"Nemesis\\" is a decent Trek flick, though how much you like it will depend on how much you like TNG's band of Trek.   <br /> <br />PLOT: The Romulan Star Empire suffers a militaristic coup.  (Romulans are perennial rivals of the Federation, and their background hints at the Chinese as well as imperial Rome).  Though Romulan generals are backing the move (in which the entire senate is killed by a mysterious radiation weapon that shrivels them), the real culprits are \\"Remans\\" - Nosferatu-looking denizens of Romulus's sister world.  Leading the faction is a young man who is neither Romulan nor Reman, but a cloned human named Shinzon (Tom Hardy).  We learn that Romulans had cloned Starfleet Captain Picard years ago in hopes of substituting him and subverting Earth from within.  When the plan never panned out, Shinzon was discarded and sent to an almost certain death in the dilitium mines of Remus.  Big mistake - couldn't those silly Romulans have realized that Shinzon would survive the experience to become steeped in hatred of both Romulans and humans?  That he would rise to lead the Remans?  To build a monster super-starship that outguns and outruns anything built by anybody else in the Galaxy? And that he'd become everybody's problem?  Not realizing Shinzon's intentions or his origins, Starfleet dispatches Picard to Romulus to greet Shinzon - now the Praetor.  Before then, the Enterprise makes an unplanned stop on a remote pre-spaceflight world where they discover and activate an earlier model of Data.  Reaching Romulus, Picard soon learns the secret of their shared DNA and Shinzon's plans for Earth and the Romulans.   <br /> <br />At best, Nemesis is okay - though at worst, it's got a loose plot that unravels quickly - richer than \\"First Contact\\", but inferior to that film which was more tightly plotted.  The Picard in \\"Contact\\" had some genuine character flaw - will he let his hatred of the Borg sway him from taking the right course?  Here, he's just compulsively noble.  Just about every scene raises questions, and not the kind that scripts should engender - Picard becomes a one-man fighting machine aboard Shinzon's ship; the Remans can snatch Picard off the Enterprise, but can't locate him on their own ship? Shinzon is supposed to be a clone of Picard - but was Picard bald at that age?  Also, he looks, acts and thinks nothing like Picard (though, in a thematic sense, the main characters are so interchangeable, they are largely clones of each other); the crew lands on a primitive planet whose backward inhabitants have otherwise matched Starfleet in the critical technology of dune-buggies.  Fans of Worf will lament his under-use hear (he seems snappy, like he knows that he's about to become somebody's punchline).  The script plays up the sentimental connections between main characters, even as it makes them as stiff as ever.  The story itself seems a pastiche of storylines from other Treks, especially the classic \\"Wrath of Khan\\" (the villain is an obsessed enemy with a painful past; a weapon that can render whole worlds lifeless; starship dogfighting inside of some nebula-looking thing climaxes the movie, along with an act of sacrifice by one of our heroes) and there aren't enough plot turns or twists to set Nemesis apart from the rest. <br /> <br />Still, it's a decent flick that won't send you scurrying for a copy of \\"Attack of the Clones\\".
B00006RU5B|4.0|With Rage Against the Machine behind Chris Cornell and Chris Cornell in front of Rage Against the Machine, I was expecting the hybrid I heard when bought the CD. Driving rock with Tom Morello's unusual rythmic guitars setting not only the melody but also the rythmn of the songs, Cornell's clear as a bell voice, and the tighest drum/bass combo you could ask for. Everything was there. <br />  <br /> Know, all that was needed some tighter song structure and for Cornell to sing more than two or three notes TOTAL in the songs. I guess by using a rapper for the first part of their history, Rage wasn't sure what to do with a guy that could actually could sing. <br />  <br /> But when it works, it works beautifully. &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot; is my favorite song on the CD. I've asked that question to many, or maybe to few times before. <br />  <br /> All in all a solid debut from a band I hope survives to make a second record, all signs point that!
B00005MM67|4.0|K2 is more realistic and definitely better than the more successful blockbuster climbing movies such as 'Cliffhanger' and 'Vertical Limit'. This movie is shot on original location and has very few special effects unlike the other two. The story is also more believable. Unfortunately this movie was not marketed well enough because it is definitely one of the best climbing movies of all time.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Anyone who gave this movie a bad review should be beaten up by Tyler Durdan.  This movie has excellent realistic fight scenes, its a deep movie, and some of you people obviously can't see the overall genius of the movie.  Excellent movie, no doubt about it.
B00005JK8K|5.0|Windtalkers is a great movie. Its about a guy who has to guard a Navaijo Code Talker. Its kind of gory and its not about bunnys and rainbows. If u liked Saving Private Ryan you should watch Windtalkers.
0345350499|5.0|I had always put it off as a &quot;chick book&quot; and never got around to taking on the 800+ pages. I was bored this summer, so I decided to give it a try. At first, I considered stopping, but decided to get at least 100 pages in before giving up. After that I continued reading, but it felt more like a soap opera than epic. Around 300 pages in I was engrossed. The characters are so alive. I felt like I had grown up with the characters and understood all of them as if they were close friends. That was the best part, I really cared for the characters, especailly Lancelet. I couldn't put it down. Even though I knew how things would turn out, I was always wondering what was around the corner. I was VERY sad when it was over. The ending is a little anti-climactic, but that can be forgiven for the point MZB is trying to make. This is a wonderful book that I would recommend to anybody, whether they are into the genre or not. This book has it all: action, romance, betrayal, suspense... It is fantastic.
1920769005|5.0|I just love this book. Its beautiful, moving and illuminating in every one of its 900 pages. Its simply un-put-down-able. I havent read such an engaging book for a long long time. <br /> <br />I loved looking at Bombay through his eyes. The little things he notices and sees deeply is fantastic! Also, he is so compassionate and kind in his writings.  <br /> <br />Its the first favorite book of mine now. :) <br /> <br />

B000286S8S|5.0|You know what they say about opinions....they are like ***holes. Everybody has one. Lesson number one: music is an art form. Painting, photography, drawing, sculpting, music, any form of enlivening the senses -- ALL of it is art. What I see in most of the negative reviews here is jealousy in the fact that no other band or you reviewers can produce such an artform as Van Halen, regardless of its singer. Concerning the 3 new tracks, it is Eddie at his finest, with extreme intricacy and delicacy on \\"Learning to See\\", as well as very well-written, sung, and funny \\"Up for Breakfast\\". Just look around the Web a bit at all the rave reviews of that song. It is the essence of Van Halen all over again. Van Halen music is recognized foremost by the guitar that's heard. It's unmistakable. Stop whining about singers. The music rocks, and Van Halen is about rock music. Dave sang slow stuff (\\"Jamie's Cryin'\\",\\"Dance the Night Away\\"), yet they were hits. Same with Sammy. Many of you folks have tunnel vision, and live in the past in some hole so deep you can't see any light comin' down. Sammy Hagar is equal with David Lee Roth because of the simple fact that he is a different man and has won over millions of fans around the world just like DLR. How did he do it? He can sing wonderfully. You got that folks? The man can sing. If you hate Eddie now, you never liked Van Halen. It has his last name, remember? If you don't like the new stuff, you never liked rock music or creativity, and seemingly never heard any in your life. As far as the selection of tracks that make up this compilation, the band collectively chose their favorites. All of you are different, and the band would have to release its entire catalog to satisfy all of you. Finally, this set is fine exactly as it is, and this fine piece of art stands its ground no matter how hard anyone wants to shake it. One last pointer; this 2004 tour is selling like mad, unlike these bad reviewers getting all their buddies to put in a goodvote for 'em and/or registering with Amazon under false names just so they can vote on their own pathetic reviews.
B000089RVX|5.0|It's hard for me to articulate how much I love this band. There are so few female rock singers, and they all seem to have hard, raspy voices that &quot;fit&quot; the music. Amy Lee, on the other hand, has an operatic voice that is a beautiful counterpoint to the screaming guitars and hard baselines. For those who might wonder, she sounds just as amazing live, at least she did when I saw them.   The first track and second single, &quot;Going Under&quot; is dark, bitter, and mournful. The first single, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; off the Daredevil soundtrack, is the song that earned comparisons with Linkin Park, as a male rapper from the band 12 Stones adds his voice to the track for a rap-metal sound, but this is the only song with that feel on the album (thankfully). &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; is a strong statement of refusing someone's falsity and betrayal, stating that one who has &quot;everybody fooled&quot; becomes &quot;everybody's fool&quot;. &quot;My Immortal&quot; is a piano ballad written by Amy Lee when she was only 14, a gorgeously sung tribute to the pain of a relationship ending. &quot;Haunted&quot; is gothic and disturbing, a song about contradicting feelings, complete with spooky bells and heart-monitor sound effects. &quot;Tourniquet&quot; is a song surrounded by controversy, as many took the reference to God and Christ to mean it was a Christian song. Nothing could be further from the truth. If you listen closely, you'll find poetic references to self-mutilation and cutting. The reference to God is &quot;My God, my tourniquet&quot;, which is of course a bandage used to stop profuse bleeding, there are references to wanting to die, and the line that mentions Christ is: &quot;Christ: Tourniquet; my suicide&quot;. Not very godly, as the band pointed out themselves, wondering why they would ever be on the Christian charts. Moving on, &quot;Imaginary&quot; is a poem about depression and escaping the world through fantasy, sung delicately but powerfully, a rare talent I've found only in Amy Lee. This has to be my favorite song on the album. &quot;Taking Over Me&quot; is a creepy stalker love song. &quot;Hello&quot; is another piano-ballad type song about dark reality, realizing you're &quot;not sleeping&quot; in a world of pain. &quot;My Last Breath&quot; is a powerful song of longing, describing holding rapturous thoughts within you, but knowing it ends, one way or another. The final track, &quot;Whisper&quot;, is a plea with one's self not to give in to pain; a song about trying to escape death, ending with eerie chants that slowly fade away. The album is gorgeous and dark, understanding and empathizing with anybody's pain in a voice that can pierce your heart and bones. If there is a perfect voice in female rock, it is Amy Lee, and anyone who likes rock in general and chick-rock in particular should own this album.
B000000WCA|4.0|Okay, so the Spice Girl's might not have the best vocals ever, their beats got a little annoying, and hell, that spice girls movie was a big wad of crap. But the spice girls have that sort of flare to them.... Somethings that made the whole world turn their heads to listen to them a few years ago. The spice girls still have a place in my heart, considering they were my favorite band (and probably the favorite band of a lot of girls my age) when I was in Middle School. I still listen to their cd sometimes, though not very often. It helps remind me of an age where &quot;Bubblegum&quot; described music, Britney Spears was a virgin, and girls could break their ankles walking around in 10'' Platform Boots. So, let me salute the Spice Girls for old times sake! Viva Forever, spice girls... Wait, the last thing I want is for the spice girls to live forever... Or, wait.... Who Do You Think You Are Wannabe Spice Girls.... nah, that doesn't work either... how about Mama If You Can't Dance Naked Who Do You Think You Are?? Or Or.....
B00028HBKC|5.0|I am a Christian and have seen the movie. I am frankly puzzled why there has been so much made about the violence in the movie. The purpose of the movie was to show what Jesus sacrificed and endured for us. It does this very well. It is the only movie that I have ever attended where when the movie finished and the credits started to roll, no one moved or spoke. Stunned silence. This movie reaches your soul unless you close yourself off to it. As a Christian I needed to see this. I did not &quot;enjoy&quot; it - but I needed to see it. My wife wept openly after the movie. I felt like my best friend had just died - which is exactly what happened. Now I can truly understand what &quot;crucified&quot; means. This is real - Roman executions were like this and in fact worse than is shown. The descriptions of Christ's sufferings in the Bible are much more extensive than what is shown in the movie. Some of the beatings that he was forced to endure during this time are not shown in the movie. There were more than was shown. This was a violent, horrific death and a glorious resurrection. To show it otherwise would not do justice to the sufferings that Jesus endured for us. We live in a sanitized world here in the US. Christians are enduring sufferings much like this in the persecuted church worldwide now as I write this review. While we are sitting comfortably in our homes and discussing whether this movie may be too violent and being shocked by it and concerned, other Christians are living this now. If you are a Christian and don't like the violence in this movie (who would), help our brothers who are dying - yes dying for their faith. They don't like the violence either.
0385504209|2.0|Seventy pages into Dan Brown's surprisingly putdownable potboiler, the inevitably green-eyed, French-accented code cracker Sophie Neveu sighs, \\"This is not American television, Mr Langdon.\\" Oh, Sophie, if only that were true. You know a book owes too much to the screen when an albino assassin appears on the very first page, and rather than taking the time to construct an original variant on the intelligent-action-man hero you're simply instructed to think of Harrison Ford - in tweed. This is a movie, pure and simple: a thinly plotted, strongly visual, mildly entertaining Hollywood chase movie about cardboard characters (replete with sappy childhood flashbacks) and with enough Opus Dei-bashing to make it a fast-acting antidote to \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\" Crammed full of supposedly arcane revelations about mathematics, religion, symbolism and art - most of which read like verbatim downloads from Google - the \\"intellectual\\" content won't be dazzling or new (forget accurate) to anyone even slightly inquisitive about these topics. Worse, it's presented with a juvenile fascination for \\"connections\\" that would embarrass the most seasoned New Age charlatan. It all moves at a cracking pace, of course, and has enough scope and colour to hold your rapt attention for a few winter nights, and enough Catholic conspiracy theory to warm the heart of an atheist. But it's so devoid of literary merit, so apparently committed to the squandering of every opportunity to do anything interesting with the material - rather than just ape the narrative grammar of cinema - that it truly beggars belief. The characters are just names on the page, huge swathes of deadpan \\"I'm glad you asked\\"-style exposition pad out the clunky plot shifts, and because it's all so closely modeled on the rhythms of Hollywood nothing ever comes as a surprise - not a word, not an image, not a moment. This is post-literate prose at its direst, plugging directly into pre-fabricated scenarios, characters and images, absolving the reader of the need to imagine anything - which is why it's such a famously easy read. This is reality as a simulacrum of television, a copy of a copy, and about as convincing. It's an odd stylistic choice in a novel which takes as its theme the notion that great art depicts truths which evil empires would suppress. My advice? Save your time, and wait for the movie, i.e. wait until this story is presented in its natural form. I'm actually really looking forward to it. Seriously. I quite like the story, I just dislike the way it's presented here. It's fundamentally a puerile novel, but as a Hollywood movie I'm sure I'll be tickled by it. In the mean time, if you want to read the kind of novel this purports to be, get yourself a copy of Umberto Eco's \\"The Name of the Rose\\" or, better yet, \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\". If those don't grab you, at the very least try Donna Tartt's \\"The Secret History\\" - nothing to do with the Grail, but it's certainly more deserving of the \\"intelligent thriller\\" label than this. Is there really nothing better to be said for \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", as novel?

0553382179|3.0|First, the positives: I have been a member of the FLYlady email group for over two years. I'm still on the most basic of babysteps, but it really has made a difference. If I'm following my routines (which I do slip now and then), I'm showered and dressed BEFORE I sit down to goof off on the web, and that makes it a lot easier for me to stop goofing off and head out the door. Sounds small, but has a huge impact on my day. And I'm not a middle-aged stay-at-home mom - I'm 24, single, live alone (except for my five pet rats) and am a full-time graduate student. If you don't like some little piece of the system (like wearing shoes), ignore it! With so many little pieces (like 27 fling boogies, spending 15 minutes on something so you don't burn out, etc), there's sure to be something that helps everyone. Don't trash the whole book just because you don't want to follow a step or two - FLYlady herself freely admits that her system should be customized for your life. <br />  <br /> Now, the negatives. The one thing I've nearly unsubscribed from the email list for is the syrupy attitude, self-back-patting, and religious content, and they're present in the book too; for some, they might make it unreadable. Sometimes her &quot;morning musings&quot; make me want to gag; I've just stopped reading them. If you flip through the book and decide you really can't take it, I suggest getting what you need from the website and deleting all the morning musing and testimonial emails. If you can stand it (or at least skim over it), the book is a nice way to get the whole system in one package.
B00000K3UU|4.0|Adam Sandler is not a great actor.  Like many of his compatriates, he is a personality.  In BIG DADDY, though, he appears to have worked on his thespian abilities, and after the movie gets into swing (after he adopts little Julian), he settles into the role and becomes rather convincing in it.  Although some of the humor is deliberately off color, one can't help but find it funny because a kid is involved.  How many times have we had to stifle a laugh because a kid has repeated something he's heard from an adult, and has no idea what he's saying?  That's the kind of crudeness delivered in BIG DADDY.  Along with Sandler, we get a delightful performance from Dylan and Cole Sprouse as Julian.  How can one not develop an immediate attachment to such a cute little kid?  Joey Lauren Adams oozes maternal sweetness as Layla, the girl Sandler falls in love with; Leslie Mann is perfectly bitchy as Corinne; Jon Stewart does well in his role as Kevin, the kid's real father; Rob Schneider is fun as the European delivery boy; and veteran character actor Joe Bologna is perfect as Sandler's disgusted father.  Add a nice bit by the reliable Steve Buscemi as a homeless man and you have a pretty tight cast.<br /><br />BIG DADDY is another one of those raucous feel good movies (like THE HOT CHICK and JOE DIRT), and one can't help but get caught up in its shameless sentimentality.
B000003TAW|5.0|This work is a very melodic, innocent, and beautiful album that is a timeless joy to listen to. This was the first album that I discovered on my own and passionately cared for. Listening to music before Weezer was just something I did on occassion with no real thought or feeling. This album changed my life. I changed radically in middle school and this album literally helped carry me through. I still listen to it on ocassion 4 years after I first heard it, and it still feels incredible. This is my chicken soup album...my comfort music for when I am going through hard times or such. It reminds me of happy carefree times in 7th grade when my existence was at its maximum potential and I had the chance of becoming something more than just another average doosh. This album invokes memories of hope of success, perserverance, youth, innocence and desire for experience, and happiness. It is a timeless work that is sure to live with me forever, however if you already have your own chicken soup music this might just be another album for you. Definately download \\"Only In Dreams\\", my favorite Weezer song, and give this sensation a taste.
B00008G9JM|5.0|There is no getting around the fact A Passion Play is without a doubt the most controversial album of Tull's career. The rock critics said nothing good about this album. Prog rock detractors would tend to use this album (as well as Yes' Tales From Topographic Oceans and ELP's Tarkus) as the reason punk rock happened. Fans either tend to consider this their worst album or their best album. Let's say I am one who believe in the latter. This is definately not an easy album to get in to, and it's little wonder that some of the critics that did praise Thick as a Brick didn't praise this one. Tull was going for a much more complex brand of prog than they ever done before, going as far as trying to beat Gentle Giant in the complexity game (Tull actually did tour with Gentle Giant, and GG actually ended up on Chrysalis Records by 1975, same label as Tull). In fact some of the passages of this album actually remind me a bit of Gentle Giant. Like Thick as a Brick, A Passion Play was basically one cut that takes up both sides going through many different changes, with Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond's silly children's story, &quot;The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles&quot; dividing side one and two (that is, if you own the LP). That makes reviewing this album a bit more difficult than other Tull albums (other than Thick as a Brick, of course) since it's not a collection of separate songs. John Evan added some Mini Moog synthesizer, making this the very first Tull album to use synthesizers. Still Evan's Hammond organ and piano are his most dominant keyboards. The lyrics have something to do with the afterlife and whether you'll end up in heaven or hell. Ian Anderson not only provides his trademark flute, but also sax (this isn't the first time he played sax, as he played it on &quot;Dharma For One&quot; on Tull's debut, This Was way back in '68). The album does start off rather slowly, with the sound of a heartbeat, and strange electronic effects, before the music kicks in. Here you get to hear plenty of Evan's Mini Moog, then the music slows down with just Anderson's vocals and acoustic guitar. Some of the instrumental section near the beginning tend to be quirky in a Gentle Giant manner. Then of course you get &quot;The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles&quot;. This is the only part of the album you actually get to hear David Palmer's orchestrations while Hammond-Hammond tells his story about the hare. Then you get the second half of the album which sound like five different songs, with bizarre synth effects dividing them out. I think the album's best moments are on this second (and final half). I remember when I bought this album thinking I would hate the album, hearing how the rock critics despised this album and instead this turns out to be one of my Tull favorites. That simply means you can't always believe everything a rock critic says (often he just gets his opinions from listening to a particular album only once or twice, and most good prog requires four or five listens to &quot;get it&quot;, as opposed to simple 3 minute R&B derived rock which only needs one or two listen to &quot;get it&quot;). Yes, it's difficult to get in to, but I still feel this is one of their best albums.
0061015725|1.0|This book will corrupt and ruin any reader's genuine interest in virtually every subject it touches upon. Nanotechnology, emergent behavior, flocking, none of these are explained by more than an anecdote, something which mass-market commuters that serially absorb Crichton's work will no doubt embrace, but which revolts anyone who notices that what they are reading is, from an informational perspective, running on fumes, and from a literary one, nothing more than a series of deus ex machinas, logical non sequiturs, and third-grade level prose. I personally resent his using emergent behavior, a really interesting subject for me and my network-theory brother, when he could have locked anything into his tired, childish formula, like the ring around my bathtub, which has more imagination than he does.
B000001DVD|5.0|Having gone to high school in the eighties, this is one of the most influential hard rock albums of the decade. This album was responsible for me buying a destroyer guitar. Personally, this album is more raw and more powerful than Pyromania. Pyromania is a great album, but written more for the radio. High n Dry is just pure power from a bunch of young guys with a hunger to make it. Trust me, buy this CD, play it in your car stereo, turn it up to 10 and drive on the highway!!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|These movies are classic. I was too young to actually go and see Star Wars in theaters the first time around, however I still grew up surrounded by The Star Wars phenomenon. I loved the original three movies the way they were but when Lucas redid these movies it gave me a chance to see them on the bigscreen and with the added bonus of extra scenes that are visually stunning. It isn't like they removed half the movie. In this day and age people want to see movies with extra's, hints DVDs. The extra scenes let us dig a little farther into the storyline meshing the three movies together a little more as well as meshing them with Episodes 1-3. If you don't like the added scenes then go get a drink or use the restroom while they are playing. I myself love these movies with the added scenes. I like to know as much about the storyline and the backgrounds of characters as I can. Why do you think they make so many special editions or directors cuts. If you are too immature to get past the extras and enjoy the movies we grew up with, than maybe you should search for beta versions of this Trilogy or stick with your VCR.
B0000021RG|5.0|I just found this album on LP(used)and was knocked out by the sound and clarity of it-the vocals are great and the stereo separation is excellent-the talking among Terry Kath, Peter Cetera,Robert Lamn, and others between songs is interesting -the Terry Kath guitar solos are excellent-the whole band is excellent--why this went out of print on CD is hard to figure out-it is one of the best live albums of the seventies!  This needs to be released again on CD-I do not have the book included with the LP set (it was not in the 4 LP box) but I hope it is included on the CD set--I am currently looking for a used CD copy until hopefully it is released again!!!!!!!!!!
0156027321|4.0|A friend recommended this book, saying she couldn't walk past it in a bookstore without lovingly touching its spine.  I bought it and began reading, eager to experience a similar enlightenment.  It never happpened, and I wonder if it's the book or I with the problem.  So I hesitate and resist the urge to give it 3*s (wishing I could give it 3 and 1/2, I bumped it to 4).    So many love this book that I am willing to say it is I who didn't respond properly, and as a result will read it again.  I do admit that it is well written and nicely framed, as stories go.  Also, the main character is fully developed, especially early in the book.  Perhaps my expectations sought more from it, more understanding about life and death than I received from the resolution.    I'll grant that there's a patient faithfulness, a resignation to hope that lifts this book and keeps you reading, rather similar to Hemingway's THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA.  That itself is an achievement.    To those who love this book, my apologies.  To those thinking of reading it, please do ... and draw your own conclusions.  As with most fabulations, they either work or they don't.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie will bring you to tears, bring you to confession, bring you to a NEW (or renewed for others) understanding of how much Christ loved us. The things He goes through before death will leave you speechless and wondering how anyone could endure such torture... but when He rose again and to know that we are free because of Him... it makes it all worth while. This is a classic that should be in everyone's library!
B00004W52U|5.0|Yes, step back into the early days of Gilman St. bands with this album. Some of the best known, classic punk anthems are here; &quot;Knowledge&quot; &quot;Take Warning&quot; &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;Room Without a Window&quot; are still being cover by bands today. Check out Greenday's version of &quot;Knowledge&quot; on 1,039/Smoothed out Slappy Hours. I mean we know that Tim (lint) and Matt go on to be in Downfall then Rancid but just forget that for a moment. Op. Ivy is the soul of the underground and their simple chords and speedy beats mixxed with lyrics of street livin and friendship are what drove punk to what it is today. This is a once simple neighborhood band that was just too good to be ignored, if you have the chance I would suggest getting this album in vinyl along with the Hectic E.P. Trust me it's worth it, nothing sounds better than punk on vinyl.
0453005071|5.0|These four early stories all share the same theme of a terrifing not to distant future that strikes as close to reality as a book can. The first story, Rage is a dark psychologial portrit of teenage boy who loses grip of his sanity yet at same time feels alive for the first time in his life. The most frightning thing about the story is that it has happened in real life, more than once. The second story, The Long Walk really got to me. Its a chilling tale of a disasociated American watching and waiting for a group of runners to get their \\"ticket\\" one by one. Helped inspire the contraversial Japanese satire film Battle Royale (amazing film, see it!!) The third book Road Work is the story of a man whos life and mental state detiriorate around him along with his home, job, and marrige. Until he reaches the point of no return and lashes out at society. The final story, The Running Man is the tale of a decayed and apathetic America, where the poor are expendable, and people get their thrill by watching desparate people run for their lives on the Running Man. Some of these stories are cautionary tales. Some are stories that mirror reality in a frightiningly real manner.While others are a pesimistic Freudian analisyis of the human race. All in all this is a must read book. So buy it already!!
B00029LNHS|1.0|What I do not understand is why on one hand people accuse G Unit, Jadakiss and Twista of turning commercial and on the other enjoy listening to this &quot;new&quot; black eyed peas cd. They have apparently turned their back on Hip Hop & Rap to get some money. What you can find here is just plain pop-music, which I occasionally listen to in clubs, respectively the radio, but generally try to avoid. For those who like HIP HOP/RAP pls stick to the roots, kanye west and talib kweli.
B000059Z8J|5.0|&quot;There's a strong streak of good in you Superman. But, nobody's perfect. Well..., almost nobody.&quot; - Lex Luthor polishes his ego while taunting The Man of Steel in &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;<br /><br /> One of the best sci-fi films from the 70's, is also one of the better comic book films (only surpassed by the &quot;X-Men&quot; & &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films). Richard Donner directs a faithful big screen adaption to the popular DC Comic of the same name.<br /><br /> Kryptonian peacekeeper, Jor-El has figured out that his home planet of Krypton is on a deadly collision course with its own sun. Although there is no time for a full evacuation, Big J builds a small, yet powerful, rocket placing his only son, baby boy Kal-El, safely into the rocket, launching it & sending it toward a distant planet called Earth.<br /><br /> The rocket arrives, crashing into the state of Kansas, & is found by Jonathan & Martha Kent. They soon find out that Kal has extrodinary powers and decide to adopt the boy (there excuse is Kal-El is a nephew of Martha's whose parents have died) and raise him as their own. Kal gets a name change to Clark Kent & has to downplay his powers as not to draw attention. In his late teens, Clark goes on a self-discovery journey finding out who he really is and why he was brought to Earth. Enter Superman, Clark's true identity, who stands for truth, justice & the American way. His first duty is to stop, what would become his main arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor from a deadly real-estate scam.<br /><br /> Richard Donner does a great job at directing (he would later go on to direct all 4 &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; films, as well as, &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;). He was offered the job after the success he had with &quot;The Omen&quot;.<br /><br /> The cast is truly top notch. Margot Kidder, & Christopher Reeve would go into typecasting hell because of these roles, but, I can't imagine really anyone else potraying these characters (Nicholas Cage? Ashton Kutcher? No f**king way! these guys were supposedly attached to play the new &quot;Superman&quot; that is still, as of this review, trying to get flight clearance). Gene Hackman has some of the best lines in the film thanks to Tom Mankewiez's snappy screenplay.<br /><br /> The effects aren't as great as they once were (the scene where Superman stops the dam flood with the rock avalanche looks fake & some of the rear-projection flying was getting a bit old near the end). But, the image of Supe's drilling into the concrete and walking through Luthor's underground traps to get to his lair is the classic sequence from the film, as well as, Superman's flyby in space that ends the movie (that small scene is used in the other 3 &quot;Superman&quot; films as well).<br /><br /> The DVD has a lot of great features, including screen tests, featurette's on the history of the film, and, what I like most of all, an isolated score track to listen to John Williams classic, legendary score, while watching the film. The film is remastered in 5.1 Dolby Digital with optional audio commentary with director and screenwriter to the film. It sounds awesome!<br /><br /> I do give 2 strikes to the DVD presentation. One, the film is a two sided disk, with the feature film on side 1, with the special features on side 2. Warner should have went dual-layered with this (I hate flipper disks!). Two, the packaging is in the form of those cheap, cheesy, pain in the as* cardboard snap cases, that has become Warner Home Video's trademark claiming that its made from recycled paper and plastic (I don't care!! I want a regular DVD case, so that it fits in with the rest of my collection!!).<br /><br /> Eitherway, &quot;Superman:The Movie&quot; is an indestructible film that's worth owning.Cage?

6305212112|5.0|Jon Avnet's 1991 film on life and everlasting frienship. A very touching film with multiple themes explored through deep character studies.          Kathy Bates stars as a wife in crisis who feels that she's everyone else's door mat. By accident, she becomes friends with an elderly lady (Jessica Tandy) who lives in a retirement home and receives little company. Kathy Bates becomes captivated by the old woman's stories of friends she knew a long time ago. After offering many visits to hear her stories, Bates becomes good friends with Tandy's character. Tandy's narratives change the scenes to the past to follow the lives of two women (Mary Stuary Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker) living in the South in the 20s and 30s. One of the friends is the reserved Southern Belle while the other is the fiercely independent tomboy. Because the women are both at odds with many of the customs and traditions of the South (segregation, marriage, etc.) they are soon faced with hostility. The story goes on to cover all of the trials and tribulations the women encountered in their lives and how such adversity made them stronger.          Again, a very touching film on life and its challenges. The film explores how personal and social struggles can bring out the best and the worst in the human being. A well made film that moves the spirit and appeals to all genders and ages.
0141000198|5.0|I haven't seen the movie but I may buy it after reading the book. This book is hysterically funny. A great fast and easy read for those days that you really need a laugh. I not only found my self in tears of laughter while reading this book but also nodding in agreement with Bridget as she complains about guys, food, dieting and all that other &quot;girl stuff.&quot; Buy this book for your girlfriend who just got dumped. She'll love it.
B0001O3YD0|4.0|It had been quite some time prior to this film that a successful sci-fi/horror genre had been released.  Audiences were mostly being burried under a pile of mediocre alien films and cheap conventional horror.  Director David Twohy brought back this fading genre with new concepts, good effects, and a rather decent cast. <br /> <br />The plot is laid out in the main review and so I won't go over it here.  The story itself is solid and allows the audience to immerse themselves in the adventure of the characters without great leaps in reasoning: a common problem in the science fiction genre.  In terms of acting, Radha Mitchell played a very credible role as a shaken but resolute captain. The star of the show is of course Vin Diesel as Riddick, a shiny eyed alien who can see in the dark.  His character was the basis of a less-than-stellar spinoff 'Chronicles of Riddick.'  Cole Hauser as Riddick's tormentor also did a pretty good job.  The film has excellent special effects with monsters that are quite terrifying to look at. <br /> <br />A fun cat-and-mouse horror/sci-fi film that is worth multiple viewings.  I strongly recommend it.
B00008BRB5|4.0|If you're a fan of later day &quot;Police&quot;, this is practically your greatest hits album right here. Not only was it their most popular record, but the whole thing is excellent. This includes the huge hits &quot;King Of Pain&quot;, &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot;, and &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;. But what's so great is that the other tracks are at least as good. &quot;Synchronicity I & II&quot;, &quot;Murder By Numbers&quot;, and &quot;Tea In The Sahara&quot; I all enjoy just as much. I know this for sure, if I didn't still have a copy on vinyl, I'd be ordering this right now. Everyone and their &quot;Mother&quot; should own it.
B0000648WZ|5.0|A science-fiction pulp satire based on Robert Heinlein's (author of Farenheit 451)novel of the same title. Director Paul Verhoeven and writer Ed Neumeier present their own satirical version of the novel with spectacular and extremely graphic special effects.    The Earth is under the governance of a fascist state in which citizenship is conditional upon proper military service: commonly accepted rights are reduced to privileges granted on the condition that one perform state-mandated duties.  Several young friends soon join the ranks to fight a mysterious race of gigantic insects who are assaulting the planet.  The new cadets join the space fleet to attack the giant pests on their home planet of Klandathau but things don't go as planned: the critters are smarter than anyone thought and put up a stiff resistance.    The film is presented in a rather comical/cartoonish manner to emphasize the satirical themes.  Although the acting is somewhat weak with perhaps the exception of Michael Ironside as the hardened sergeant, it's the special effects that are the prize of the film.  These are truly some of the most impressive CGI effects ever presented and there's no shortage of blood and guts.  For this reason, I would not recommend this film for young children or disturbed adolescents.  The gore in this film is the most graphic I've ever seen and I'm certainly not shy to violence in films.    A great satire/sci-fi/action film with great effects and a good plot.  Definitely a film you can enjoy over and over again.
B000002JAX|5.0|I found this disc by chance and what a chance! Madeline sounds so fresh and vibrant across a wide range of material. I have passed it on to several folks of varying tastes and backgrounds and they were equally enchanted. We are now collectively waiting for more sightings and more offerings on disc. Madeline, don't give up. The world is out of sync, not you. We are waiting!!!!!
B000002WYT|4.0|DMB is a ragtag bunch of dudes who devote their entire lives to playing their songs, and Crash is a true testament to that honest, sincere and tenacious desire they have for making thoughtful, upbeat music in a completely original fashion. Most bands can be compared to countless different groups from all different eras, but I think Dave manifests a fantastic sound that is all its own. Sure, the name is tossed around with bands like Phish, O.A.R. and Rusted Root, but honestly, other than being known for putting on outstanding liveshows, DMB has very little in common with those bands. Crash is an archetypal album, a seminal recording that seems to channel the energy of a thousand different cultures into one stunning amalgamation of heartfelt tunes. Songs like Crash Into Me, #41, Lie in Our Graves and So Much to Stay are prime examples of this bands talent. These tracks will stay with you for a long time. I know that Dave Matthews Band is put down by a lot of people for a number of reasons, but personally, I can't find anything wrong with Crash. Check it out.
B000059PPN|4.0|No figure in the horror film genre is as divisive as Lucio Fulci. After watching one or two of his films, viewers tend to move into one of two camps. One side hails Fulci as a master of terror, a man who upped the gore quotient in his films while creating wonderfully atmospheric pictures. For these people, Fulci is right up there with the likes of Dario Argento as one of the best filmmakers ever to emerge from Italy. The other camp sneers at these claims, pointing to the plodding pace of his films, the use of extreme gore to camouflage plot holes, and the director's inability to draw good performances out of his cast as evidence of mediocrity. Initially, I enjoyed Fulci's films, specifically &quot;Zombie,&quot; &quot;City of the Living Dead,&quot; and &quot;The New York Ripper&quot; because I did not know any better. When I came on the scene, you went to Fulci to feed your craving for gore. What a difference a few years exploring the genre makes! While I will not go so far as to remove Lucio from my play list altogether, I have seen enough of his films to realize he is not a cinematic genius. He is at best a competent director, at worst an abysmal one, and there are plenty of examples of bad filmmaking in this director's filmography. &quot;Zombie&quot; is without a doubt his best film, but &quot;The House By The Cemetery&quot; runs a close second along with &quot;The Beyond&quot; and &quot;The Gates of Hell.&quot;<br /><br /> Good old Lucio amazingly foregoes his usual heavy gore quotient with &quot;House,&quot; instead attempting to ramp up the atmospheric qualities of the film. It's the story of a house by a cemetery (!) once lived in by Dr. Freudstein, a physician who quickly earned an unsavory reputation amongst the local denizens for unspecified atrocities committed in his basement. These events occurred way back in early twentieth century, but his reputation lives on in the minds of the poor dupes who rent the house. The latest victims are the Boyle family, mother Lucy (Catriona MacColl), father Norman (Paolo Malco), and son Bob (Giovanni Frezza). The trio moves into Freudstein's old abode when Norman, a professor at a New York City university, decides to finish up a deceased colleague's research. Apparently, Dr. Peterson couldn't hack it up in Freudstein's house so it is up to Norm to finish the assignment. A few problems present a host of difficulties for the young professor. First, wife Lucy seems to have suffered a nervous breakdown at one point in her life, and continues to have issues requiring periodic hysterical fits followed by heavy doses of medication. Second, son Bob claims that he is seeing and conversing with a young, redheaded girl by the name of Mae (Silvia Collatina), a girl who warns the young boy not to go into the house. Aaah, the life of an academic, eh?<br /><br /> What happens once the young family moves in? Oh, the usual Fulci stuff. It turns out Freudstein's experiments were quite ghastly, that the good doctor didn't actually pass away but instead learned a few secrets that allowed him to keep up the appearance of the house. To do so, Freudstein must routinely butcher anyone who ventures across the doorstep. The key to the whole film rests on a locked door leading into the cellar. The Boyle family continually experience problems with this portal and the basement it leads to. When Norman finally opens the door and wanders inside, a cheesy looking bat that looks like it is on loan from an Ed Wood, Jr. production attacks the professor with quite bloody results. The basement will continue to dominate center stage for most of the film. In the meantime, Norm turns up a bunch of scary information at the library about Freudstein, including a taped statement from the late Peterson about the supernatural activities going on in the house. Little Mae keeps turning up to make cryptic statements about the abode, a creepy babysitter named Anne (Ania Pieroni) appears to make things interesting, and the real estate agent who rented the house to the Boyles seems to know more than she's letting on.<br /><br /> That ought to be enough to give you an idea about the film. The good points of the film outweigh the negatives. While you get less gore than in &quot;Zombie&quot; or &quot;The Gates of Hell,&quot; you still bear witness to a gory prodding with a poker, a couple of slashed throats, an impaling, and a few other saucy surprises. Fulci even delivers a few chills. For example, there's a great scene at the beginning of the film where Bob sees Mae in a picture of the house hanging on the wall of his parents' apartment. The eventual appearance of Freudstein is unsettling and graphic. Unfortunately, we also get Fulci's trademark plot threads that go nowhere and a confusing conclusion. Worse, there's Bob. Imagine, if you will, a little kid that looks a lot like Klaus Kinski must have appeared as a child but with a dub job so bad that it peels paint off walls. Who in the heck did the voiceover for this kid? Bob is so annoying you'll miss out on significant portions of the movie while recovering from his dialogue.<br /><br /> The Anchor Bay treatment of Fulci's classic looks superb. The transfer is amazingly clear and the score sounds great. Extras include two trailers for the film (loved the voiceover of the guy who did those trailers!), a stills gallery, and biographies for Fulci and screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti. You don't get as many extras here as you do with &quot;The Beyond&quot; or &quot;Zombie&quot; discs, 'tis true, but I didn't miss them. Give &quot;The House By The Cemetery&quot; a shot if you're just getting into Fulci; you'll definitely want to check out his better known stuff first, but skipping this one would be tragic.l estate agent who rented the house to the Boyles seems to know more than she's letting on. <br />  <br /> That ought to be enough to give you an idea about the film.

B000002UAT|4.0|I don't have to tell you, you should already know, it's like one of the most influential albums of all time, probably the most influential in the last 50 or so years. Actually it is often touted as the best album of all time, or at least there abouts. So there might be some disappointment with some people given the best album ever tag, or something along those lines.     Basically the Beatles created a new sound, they used technology to try and achieve some colourful guitar sounds, they used interesting instruments such as organs and trumpets and wrote some fantastical lyrics, and some lyrics about a cultural revolution, I suppose (She's Leaving Home).     The album begins with the title track, I don't really like it, I think after a few listens the novelty wears off, but most people seem to like it... Then there 'With a little help from my friends', which cuts out a nice groove, and is a memorable song to this day, and Joe Cocker does a nice job of it too. Then comes the best song on the record in my opinion, 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds'. There's harpsichords (well sounds like it), sitars, organs and colourful guitar effects, and fantasy lyrics, and catchy chorus. This song is one of the best songs of all time. So inspiring, so original, so enjoyable to listen to. Trouble is, they have kind of set the bar for what you can expect for the rest of the album, but don't really deliver. I'm going to stick up for 'Getting better', a classic piece of rock n roll, great guitar tone. The ballad 'She's leaving home' is heart-wrenching and is very intelligent too. The Indian inspired 'Within You Without You' rewards a patient listener, but 'For the benefit of Mr.Kite', behind all the glitz is a weak song. Of course, there's that classic piece of English Vaudeville 'When I'm 64', everyone knows that one. The other masterpiece is 'A day in the life', with it's big orchestra bursts and good melody and is a very interesting piece, though I don't personally like it. I'm increasingly liking 'Lovely Rita' more and more, the backing vocal chants are really psychedelic, and it's a fun song.     I don't know if this is the best album of all time or not, but compared with the best songs on this album, which includes 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds', some of the other songs aren't really as good. But I'll give 'Sgt. Pepper' this, it's a fun, enjoyable album, from beginning to end, it's entertaining and it's very influential, so what more could you ask?
0316168815|2.0|For months I've heard about how wonderful this book is. However for some reason it just didn't seem appealing to me. I would see it on display in bookstores and pass right by it. Then a friend told me how much she loved the book and insisted that I read it. So, I checked it out of the library (thankfully) instead of purchasing it. I genuinely do not understand why this book is the success that it is. The first chapter smacks you in the face and then the rest of the book simply falls apart. I found that most of the characters were either underdeveloped or unrealistic. In fact the only character that seemed realistic in any way to me was Buckley. The Mother was particularly bothersome to me. I simply cannot believe that any mother would tell her child she wanted to be more than a mother, leave the family for several years and than upon her return, have her husband completely accept her back into the family. Like many other reviewers of this book, I too was confused by the sex between Susie/Ruth and Ray. The thing that bothered me the most about this scene was the fact that this girl who had been raped would find it acceptable to &quot;use&quot; another woman's body to have sex. I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of 1, only because I did appreciate the premise of the book and how the author did get my attention in the beginning.
B000002KD9|5.0|Let me first get this clear, I just love Neil Young. I'm writing this review as a true fan. Anyhow this is one of my favorite albums with Neil Young. If you havn't heard him before this is an album to reccomend to get a true opinion if you like him or not. I'ts tunes with nice melodies and lyrics. Very easy to listen to. <br />All I can say is BUY IT!
B00005JN2F|4.0|The plot of the movie is not really the selling point. But I am thrilled all the same, not by the story but by the fast pace and stunning visuals. Acting isn't all that great either (probably because the script doesn't offer too much room for the cast to perform), but again it doesn't matter much for this spy thriller. I was tired when I stepped into the theatre. But such is the energy level of the movie that I even felt so refreshed after the movie. Even the romance part in this movie is squeezed. And it's replaced by, you bet, even more actions. <br /> <br />CIA and the villains pursued Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) across half the Europe. Then before you know it, the hunted has briefly switched role and become the hunter. There's not really a scene that offers the audience a chance to go refill their popcorn. The movie might not be particularly memorable, but it's sleek, fast and classy. In short, it's a typical summer-holiday kind of way to spend two hours <br />
B000002KGT|5.0|I really havn't listened to Fleetwood mac before this album som I'm not familiar with the stuff before the girls entered the group.  <br /> Anyway, I just love this album. It contains songs with great lyrics and &quot;sing along tunes&quot;. I've reccomended it to many of my friends with different taste in music an they've all loved it. It's music to play in your car, at a party or just when youre hanging out. Very easy listening but still very interesting. <br /> i don't relly know what to compare it with but I'm sure that you will not regret it if you purchased this album.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Hype. It is the best thing that can happen to an upstart band, but is also sometimes the worst thing that can happen to us music fans. With their self-titled debut Franz Ferdinand have proved themselves worthy of more than the accolades of NME, SPIN, and others. They deserve your loyalty, your stereo, and, most importantly, your booty. Franz Ferdinand is everything that has been great about the past 30 years of rock n' roll, and yes, the past 30 years of rock n' roll has been derivative. Rock is about creative borrowing; it is about taking a reggae baseline and mashing it with post punk guitars and disco high hats. Franz Ferdinand is Brit-pop, New Wave, and Electroclash. What do these words mean? What is Franz Ferdinand? It is fashion, sex, boogie, pop, and style. It is Rock and it is Roll. It one of the best albums we are likely to hear this, or any other year. <br />By the way, Franz Ferdinand has also produced one of the greatest debuts I have ever heard. These eleven perfectly crafted tunes are tight, energetic, and could all easily occupy the A-side of a single. This is a record for summer days and dance floor nights. It is playful, catchy, and awesome. It bounces and pops with a freshness despite the fact that every song as about a hundred obvious influences. This is a record you will love if you have a heart that is not made of cranky old rock fan steel. Stay away from the haters (we will call them the Black Hands) instead, get this record, put it on, and prepare to smile.
B000002C2E|1.0|Dylan's sound has always seemed to the stuff that drunken bars are made of: wood all over the place, knock-knock-knocking barstool bores. <br /> Undoubtedly cooler closer to his time (the 60's), the times have continued a-changing. No longer the naughty moody boy who turned the Beatles onto dope and extended the lone middle finger to any establishment that cared to notice him, the folk anti-hero is still here, or was in 1997 anyway, when he released this &quot;comeback&quot; album much heralded by sycophantic critics. There were no shortage of &quot;prizes&quot; as well to give it additional cred. <br /> So then, how does it feel? <br /> Well, the first thing one notices on &quot;Love Sick&quot; is how nakedly, hauntingly...BAD the man's voice has become (not that it was ever much good anyway). All those years of put-on vocalistics, loud, mosquito-like droning into mics, clearly must have taken its toll. On &quot;Time out of Mind&quot; we have the voice unplugged, stripped to its horrible quivering rawness. The softer the singing, the deeper the cracks. <br /> It's painfully juxtaphosed on this opening track with orchestral backing which gives an embarrassingly grandiose feel to the cornflake narrative of (Dylan) being &quot;sick of this kind of love.&quot; <br /> The next track, &quot;Dirt Road Blues&quot;, promises the obvious, and then delivers some - a monotonous bandwagon riff that sounds like a cover version of another cover version of a pub standard belted out by a beer-bellied outfit in some seedy bar on a badly-attended night. Wonder if Dylan would stay seated for this one live. <br /> As the album crawls on, things don't look up. More ballads about a lovesick Dylan being left standing in doorways and so on. By the time the tenth track, &quot;Can't Wait&quot; comes along, one really can't wait - for the album to finish. &quot;My eyes are so tired, my brain is so wired&quot;, sings Dylan on &quot;Love Sick.&quot; That's exactly how the listner feels after this tiresome time in Bob Dylan's mind.
B00005JLPK|4.0|Some have complained about Mexican art icons speaking English with accents.  Frankly, this did not bother me.  I found the photography so beautiful and the acting so impressive that language was secondary.  The hot bright colors of Mexico and Frida's reflective art dazzled. Now bioflicks have come a long way.  In Frida we get a look at her sexual preferences rather than her motivation.  Her German-Jew father and Mexican mother in early scenes do not give us Freudian aficionados much to go on.  Salma Hayeck is built like a brick (...) house, so her nude scenes and the nudes of other Latin ladies were thrilling for the guys.  The lady viewers might say they were artistic.  I don't have a beef here.  I'm commenting that this movie is not for children.  Frida is quite active for a woman wracked with pain and when she dances with her girlfriend, I worried she would snap like a twig.  I suppose Hollywood thinks that too much sex and too much drugs or drink, make for a wonderful life.  Unfortunately I read misery rather than debauchery.  Still, captivating and I recommend.
B0001ENYKS|4.0|These Scottish lads sound like the descendents of David Byrne and the Talking Heads to me - and I like it! It is nice to have something to combat the doldrums of the &quot;Nickelback Era&quot; where many of the current crop of largely interchangeable modern rock bands seem to struggle to find some personality. This is a great album, and highly suggested summer listening!
B00024BHTC|1.0|Superbly written?  More like superbly ripped off from elsewhere.  This isn't a beautiful album at all but a horrible album to listen.  Proms type outtakes with a heavy guitar riff and out of key vocals sounds crap in my mind.  In fact Nightwish are one of the worst bands I've ever heard.  Kids will love em though, and from reading most of these reviews, I doubt there are many reviewers over 13 years old that are praising this band.  Except of course the Finnish loyal.
B00009UW0N|5.0|I cannot put into words how much I love this movie. It is the greatest film I have ever seen and I must have watched it more than 50 times.<br /><br />I saw this when I was 8 years old and was terrified beyond all reason. I'm too familiar with the movie to get the same effect nowadays but I still love watching this masterpiece.<br /><br />It's hard to believe there's anyone out there who needs to be convinced about the brilliance of this movie but if you haven't seen it, I envy you because you are in for one of the scariest experiences of your life.<br /><br />There is no substitute for this masterpiece. HALLOWEEN rules.<br /><br />RIP Donald Pleasance - we love you.
B00006F83Y|1.0|This albums sucks!  The songs are crap!  AVOID!
6305841861|5.0|This is the coolest film ever made (not the best, just the coolest). Everything about this movie is sensational.  <br /> <br />Watch it, see it, love it. Again and again. In this modern age of CGI effects, Evil Dead II is all the more special for its' low-tech SFX, camera tricks, rubber & latex demon charm. There's just a no-holes-barred charm to this movie that others can't match (like the lame-ass Cabin Fever crapfest which is like contracting a really bad case of Ebola for 90mins).  <br /> <br />Accept no substitutes and also check out BUBBA HO-TEP. Bruce Campbell's best performance since Army of Darkness can be found in Don Coscarelli's masterpiece. <br /> <br />I wish Raimi would make an EVIL DEAD IV but I guess now that he's gone all mainstream and everything that will only remain a dream.  <br /> <br />I love this movie. Nothing should stop you from seeing it. This is also a great DVD edition to own (until Anchor Bay make us fans shell out for a new super-duper edition some time down the road.)  <br /> <br />Avoid the crappy videogames though. They suck.
B000286S8S|1.0|So these 3 tracks are the results of an 11 year split then?  Timeless hours writing and recording in the 5150 studio?  Well all I can say is that VH have lost it now TOTALLY!  You would have thought that after the agony Eddie has been through over the past few years the music would reflect more emotion, but no it's dead, pure Van Hagar fashion.  These tracks are crap, I have played them once and that's the last time I ever bother listening to em.  So if this is an introduction to their next album, then `Fair Warning' cause I certainly won't be buying it.  R.I.P Van Halen, a long time ago you use to be a cool band, but now you suck suck suck!
B00008EY9G|5.0|Some people hated this movie once the twist ending was revealed. I just don't understand that - it was a cool idea and a really bold move on the part of the writer. John Cusack and the cast do a great job. <br /> <br />This has to be one of the most visually beautiful storms ever committed to celluloid. Great flick in 5.1 surround. <br /> <br />Is the writer the same Michael Cooney who wrote the bizarre killer snowman flick JACK FROST? He's certainly picked up his act since that film, and I'm not referring to the Michael Keaton film of the same name. <br /> <br />Hope Mangold keeps making thrillers like this. Nice work. <br /> <br />John C.McGinley is a great actor.!
1400032717|4.0|I just finished Curious Incident last night. While I was not &quot;wowed&quot; quite as much as the earlier reviews led me to expect, I still would recommend this novel to friends. The author has a true gift for writing from the autistic protagonist's point of view and he does so consistently. It was very interesting to &quot;see&quot; the world through this narrator's eyes. Also, the plot is clever and entertaining. Enjoy!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Lucas, are you reading this?  You are an idiot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
038572179X|4.0|the story is a slow starter that picks up pace and concludes in a very interesting fashion. <br /> <br />the real interesting part of the book is its storyline. it jumps from one time period/location to another while leaving many unanswered questions behind. some of these are resolved in later sections, others are not, and there are some real surprises too. <br /> <br />in the first part of the book we see 13 year old briony who witnesses a flirtatous encounter between her sister and a servant's son. her imagination and immaturity twist subsequent events that change the lives of everyone. the rest of the book jumps years ahead to trace the effect on everyone's lives and the final atonement of the sins. <br /> <br />the most interesting section is the retreat to dunkirk in the early years of world war II. <br /> <br />you really don't appreciate the ingenuity of the book, however, until the end. <br /> <br />this was my first mcewan book, and it won't be my last.
B0000AOV85|5.0|If you are a fan of Dark Side of the Moon (DSotM) then you will love this disc. The feature runs as long as the actual album and gives insight into the development of each song. It's amazing to see the Floyd seperately playing bit pieces of each song. What is amazing on this DVD is Alan Parsons and his explanations and demonstrations of all the details we have grown to love on this disk. The bonus material rocks just as hard. Over 10 bonus tracks including additional interviews, insight and music. Pink Floyd is the best!!!!
B000286S8S|5.0|OK, so they dumped David Lee Roth, I didn't like it either but this disc set rocks!  Sammy Hagar CAN sing so the band does NOT suck just because he's in it.  Van Halen brings back a lot of good memories and since I bought this set I haven't listened to anything else.  Have you heard the crap on the radio these days?!  I'd much rather listen to VH than that junk!
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second album takes the songwriting up a serious notch from that which was displayed on their debut album, Kill 'Em All. Don't get me wrong, I love Metallica's first album as well, but even though this album was released just one year after their first album, they display much maturity on this record. First of all, the band most likely were more cohesive as an ensemble since Kirk Hammett was now an established member of the band, whereas with Kill 'Em All, he had barely been in the band.<br /><br /> For those who don't know, whereas Kill 'Em All for the most part was lyrically about themselves in the band, with such songs as &quot;The Four Horsemen,&quot; &quot;Metal Militia,&quot; and &quot;Motorbreach,&quot;; RtL, rather is an album seemingly all about death, from execution, to suicide, to being &quot;trapped under ice&quot; to the Angel of Death; the whole album is an examination of all things morbid. This album also includes the last batch of material by Dave Mustaine who went on to Megadeth, though he would argue he also developed the riff to Damage, Inc among other later songs.<br /><br /> The songwriting on this record is actually rather complex, and personally this album is my favorite, in a virtual tie with Master of Puppets. Here is the track breakdown:<br /><br /> 1)Fight Fire with Fire--this song has a great baroque-sounding intro that then evolves into a great pounding riff (much like Battery on the subsequent record) however, the song seems to fall short after about the first minute and a half, becoming one of the weaker songs on the record.<br /><br /> 2)Ride the Lightning--The title track of this record is probably one of the most underrated Metallica songs ever, the breakdown 2/3 of the way through with Kirk's solo is one of the best ever.<br /><br /> 3)For Whom the Bell Tolls--probably one of the best Metallica songs ever, EVER made. This song is a flawless march about death in the Spanish American War. The intro riff is one of the best heavy riffs ever.<br /><br /> 4)Fade to Black--at this point, this was probably Metallica's slowest song...the lyrics are very depressing yet full of heart, it's with songs like this, that they can be taken much more seriously, than say, Metal Militia.<br /><br /> 5)Trapped Under Ice--without a doubt the most mediocre song on this record, it just seems very sub-par, as though little effort went into it.<br /><br /> 6)Escape--I personally love the somewhat mellow solo in this song. I think this is another underrated Metallica song, and actually seemingly breaks the mold of their normalcy at this point, it actually sound different than anything they had ever done.<br /><br /> 7)Creeping Death--without a doubt the most powerful song on the record with the most catchy breakdown chorus ever crafted &quot;Die...by my hand...&quot; This is probably one of their best known and most liked really heavy songs.<br /><br /> 8)Call of Ktulu--this is one of the 3 EPIC instrumentals Metallica recorded, the others being Orion, and To Live is to Die. This song seems to rely on a lot of classical influences, though it is nonetheless crushingly heavy. The great thing about this song is is somehow captures a feeling of tension like something evil is brewing...perhaps a Ktulu is being called...I don't quite know. Also, the blisteringly heavy closure to this song is downright incredible. By the way, Cliff Burton has an amazing bass solo through most of this song which can be barely heard due to equalization holding the bass so low...turn up the bass on your stereo to hear the amazing solo.e best heavy riffs ever. <br />  <br /> 4)Fade to Black--at this point, this was probably Metallica's slowest song...the lyrics are very depressing yet full of heart, it's with songs like this, that they can be taken much more seriously, than say, Metal Militia. <br />  <br /> 5)Trapped Under Ice--without a doubt the most mediocre song on this record, it just seems very sub-par, as though little effort went into it. <br />  <br /> 6)Escape--I personally love the somewhat mellow solo in this song.

B00000J7SS|5.0|this music pulls and aches and it plays with itself gushing its spirals of touch drums and building to sonic tenders. it goes and rips sewing the stiches you needed and bleeding that muscle that never kicks enough. oh to feel as one normally does is painful. it needs to be flushed, expelled with the waste. It needs to be inseminated and screwed on tight in that loose lid way. expend. spend that sound. miles.
B000000P17|4.0|Im a big GNR fan but never bought the cd before cause It was only covers and it didnt do well at all.But I bought it cause it was cheap. I listened to it and i dont think it is bad at all. I thought it was right up there with all the GNR albums. Id go buy it. <br />Since I dont have you is a great song that axl sings <br />New Rose isnt bad Duff sings it so its ok <br />Down on the Farm really rocks! <br />Human Being is another good song <br />Raw power wasnt as good as the rest <br />aint it fun is a great dark song <br />Buick makane was actualy one of my favorite songs on the album <br />Hair of the dog has to be my favorite for the sweet talk box solo <br />Attitude is an amazing song only 2.27 minutes i think though <br />Black leather is ok <br />You cant put your arms arond a memory is good cause duff plays almost all the instruments <br />I dont care about you is good  <br />The bonus track is ok too
B0002HTZJI|5.0|I bought the import of this CD a few weeks ago (and it's identical to the U.S. release).  I must say this is a fine live album.  The sound is mixed very well and the execution is great.  The band sounds great and the cover songs are decent as well.  The only issue is if you are a fan of their earlier stuff (pre-warner bros...EMI releases) then you won't hear a thing from the past.  Give It Away and Under the Bridge are the only 2 songs that are from before the Californication album.  But at least they sound terrific.  There is a very great feel to the CD and it only makes me wish I was there to see it live.  Definitely a keeper and definitely good for people who are fans of their recent stuff.
078062565X|5.0|I typically don't like old movies but King Kong truly is a classic movie.  What amazes me about the movie more than anything is the political overtones about racial prejudice, the environment, and the empathy it builds for the misunderstood Kong.  I like the original better than the remakes.
0553382179|5.0|Yes, I am a FLYBaby. I have been for over 2 years. I would highly recommend this book and Marla's website for ANYONE that isn't BO (for non-FLYBabies, that is Born Organized).  <br />  <br /> The Fly way of doing things emphasizes creating habits for managing life while working through setting up a system for cleaning and decluttering. Marla emphasizes gradual baby steps that won't overwhelm you. But the baby steps will make a BIG difference in your life. You can do anything for 15 minutes. <br />  <br /> FLYing doesn't make you a Stepford wife. FLYing isn't only for &quot;depressed&quot; people. FLYing isn't only for those that are conservative in their politics or religion. <br />  <br /> FLYing is for people who want to &quot;Finally Love Yourself&quot;. <br />  <br />
B0002EXH4K|2.0|I bought this &quot;Remixed and Remastered&quot; version thinking that it was just going to be a better sounding version of the original album...boy was i wrong! <br />  <br /> Here are a few reasons why i'm selling it now... <br />  <br /> 1 - It sounds like he RE-RECORDED most of the vocals, and just tried to reproduce the original sound...but its sloppy <br />  <br /> 2 - There are added intros to a couple of songs that just make me cringe every time i hear them...the original album flowed MUCH MORE SMOOTHLY!! <br />  <br /> 3 - I think that just about every guitar note on this album has been re-recorded, or at least altered in such a way that i dont care for it. <br />  <br /> 4 - some of the &quot;quotes&quot; (random people talking throughout the album) sound like they have been re-recorded by different people (like the asian woman that has the monologue in the song Countdown To Extinction). I dont know if these are just different takes from the original recording sessions, or if they just couldnt get the rights to use them in another version of the song, but I DONT LIKE IT <br />  <br /> 5 - I hate demo songs as bonus tracks on albums. If you want to release bonus tracks, do it all on one cd (like they did with hidden treasures) If the bonus tracks were any good then they would have either been released on the original album that they were recorded for, or they would be on their own compilation cd. Its very rare that a band has bonus tracks that are worth including on an album, and i hate how bands think that its acceptable to put stupid DEMO songs on an album...they always sound like DUMP!....NOBODY IS SUPPOSED TO HEAR YOUR CRAPPY DEMOS! THE PURPOSE OF DEMOS IS TO HELP YOU PERFECT THE SONG IN THE RECORDING PROCESS! DURRRRRRRRR <br />  <br />  <br /> __________BOTTOM LINE__________ <br /> If you love the original version of this album, then you will probably hate this version. It sounds sloppy, and it makes me think that Dave Mustaine is an ameteur when it comes to mixing songs. Stick to recording and singing Dave, we'll all be a lot happier if you let someone else do the mixing. <br />  <br /> Original Version - ***** <br /> Remixed Version - ** <br />  <br />
0767802659|5.0|Starship Troopers is one of those movies that become an instant classic. Starship Troopers was originally a book written by Robert A. Heinlein which I read a few years after seeing the movie. The movie's plot is much more different from the book, it keeps the same basic eliments of the book, but it turns up the action! The book is a sci-fi best seller that explores theories and human principles, there actually isn't much action until the last chapter. I believe this is why the movie's plot was changed from the books, it has the same characters (except the movie gets Razacks name wrong, and Dizzy Flores is changed to a woman)but storyline expands on the military action, and the bugs. Lets face it, not many people want to watch a 130 minutes sci-fi with mostly military theoreies and priciples. Naaaah, most people (including me) want to see people being ripped limp from limb.        This is what the movie will give you. You can also expect good acting, music, direction, a good storyplot, amazing effects (except the dead bodies) in a sci-fi classic.        The basic storyline is that the Arachnids (they aren't spiders but for some reason are called the Arachnids) are invading human colonies and eventually send a comet into earth, wiping out Buenos Aris and causing the humans to retaliate by invading Klendathu, home planet of the bugs. They are slaughtered and surviving main characters join Razack's Roughnecks. The Federation uses propaganda to get more people to join, as you will see in their little commercials, would you like to know more?        This movie expands on the bugs more then the book and the invasion of Klendathu is actually a World War 2 parallel. It is very similar to D-Day, however turned out more like Dieppe. I know what you are thinking, why can't the humans just nuke the bugs? There is a very good and simple explination. The bugs live underground, the brain bugs (who think for the bugs) live deep in the bug holes, aswell as the aliens to reproduce (you only hear about them) therefore by nuking the planets surface you will take out thousands of warriors, who will just be replaced with more the next day. Knowing this the troopers have to go into the bug tunnels to capture a brain....and no one has ever even seen one, its all a theory at first.        So in conclusion this is an amazing movie, one of my all time favourites, and I encourage everyone who likes sci-fi, action, thrillers or war movie to see this movie now. however if you love the book and have not seen the movie, don't expect it to be the same, it is very different, but in my opinion, better!!!
0312263120|4.0|One thing I can definately say about this book is that this was an incredibly easy book to read.  Even if you know nothing about computers it can make sense to you.  Dan Brown's style here is what made it worth reading.  The plot in itself was alright, although extremely predictable and really not even close to politically correct.  The one part that I found extremely hard to believe was how easily the hitman was able commit all these murders, especially the ones that weren't his targets such as the teenage girl.  The dialogue sounded too movie-like at times, but I didn't really mind since the book itself had the pace of a movie.  Every chapter (Almost every chapter was only a page or two) was pretty much just a scene.  Digital Fortress was actually the first Dan Brown book that I read, I just started the Da Vinci Code today and I already find it a whole lot more interesting.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This film has to be one of the greatest movies ever created, I have never seen a film that could top this one. I mean, this movie has everything, sci-fi, fantasy, action, adventure, thrills, chills, suspense, comedy...everything! Speilburg was deffinetly the perfect choice for director. I'm not going to get into the storyplot because lets face it, everybody has seen this movie, and if you haven't, where have you been the last decade? <br /> <br />The special effect in this movie are among the best I have ever seen!!! And it was made in 1993! This was before those computer graphics and a all that jazz we have today. Even movies today with computer graphics can't match Jurassic Park. It used minitures, string puppets, stop animation, animatronics (huge T-Rex head), and even guys in suits (raptors in some pictures)! <br /> <br />The acting is good at all times, it never falls behind, and the characters are well developed. The script was slightly different from the book, however, very few movies follow the books storyline word for word and when this does happen, the movie drags on forever *coff Lord of The Rings coff* (not even those movies are exactly the same). Non-the-less the script was brilliant. I read the book after seeing the movie, I thought it was amazing too!(even though you don't even see a dinosaur until the second half, that is one thing that the movie has over the book)!! <br /> <br />So in conclusion, this movie is amazing, there is absolutely no reason not to see it, even kids can see it (because its PG-13, in fact i saw it as a kid). If you read some of the bad, one star reviews, they dont even sound like they were watching the same movie, or they were drunk as they watched it (or when they wrote the review.....) and they really shouldn't be watching movies if they are going to point out every tiny little mistake in the movie, and write a paragraph about it and exploit it, making it sound worse then it really is...I've been watching this movie for 11 years, all the time! Welcome, to Jurassic Park!!!
B00006LLNU|5.0|More than enough people have written gushing reviews of this album, but it's understandable, because it's arguably the finest sequence of music that's been heard. The reason this album surpasses its wonderful predecessor, Agaetis Byrjun, is the level to which the group has pared down the arrangements. With Agaetis Byrjun, pretty much everything was thrown into the mix - brass, strings, sonar sounds - which perhaps slightly detracted from the brilliance of the compositions. I certainly wish that Vidrar Vel Til Loftarasa had been recorded in a straightforward way, as it's one of their great compositions, but the vocal is too buried and distorted on the album version. On the third album, everything is heard as it needs to be heard, without much decoration (just the odd computerised sound in the background). So you have piano, organ, bass, guitar, drums. It's very close to how the compositions are heard live (many of them are even better live, it should be said). The first track, Vaka, has regularly been used as the opener at live shows; it was only through hearing the live renditions that I fully appreciated the beauty of this piece. It is devotional; it is a spiritual exaltation, reaching out from a state of blissful reflection to a vocal climax of spiritual ecstasy. The simple piano part establishes the minimalist tone of the album. The second track, Fyrsta, shows Jonsi floating his beautiful falsetto over the downbeat notes of the guitar. It's one of those great Sigur Ros moments, when one finds one's soul lifting with the vocal, and accompanying it on its flight. It's a piece of music that can be undervalued; it really is superb. This is followed by the instrumental Samskeyti, which almost always follows on from Fyrsta at live performances: the two pieces are intended to be considered together, almost certainly. The minimalist circular piano part which drives the piece, is certainly astonishing in its ability to affect a listener; it's both hypnotic and galvinising. Sigur Ros instrumentals do not tend to match the song-compositions, but Samskeyti is an exception. This is followed by the beautiful Njosnavelin (also referred to at one time as the Nothing Song). In some ways, it is a sister to Vaka. It has a similar use of piano, and similar vocables from Jonsi, though it also employs organ to good effect. The end of the track is always slightly surprising, as the sound cuts out just as Jonsi draws in his breath as if to repeat the melodic line. One is then left twenty seconds of silence in which to readjust oneself, before the long, funereal Alafoss trudges in. The first half of the album is impressive, but the second half goes up another level. Alafoss is one of the most mournful pieces of music that's ever been recorded. It has the sombreness of a requiem played in church. Jonsi's falsetto has rarely seemed as eerie and dark as it does here. However the piece does shift towards its end, as the guitars start to exert their influence, and the organ loses its foremost position in the mix. It's not a piece that has often been performed live, which is regrettable, as it is one of the most powerful Sigur Ros compositions. It's similar in its slowness to Nyja Lagid, which was once a live fixture, but never found a studio release (only a live version on the Svefn-G-Englar EP). Alafoss is followed by the superb Ebow, with its pounding tattoo-like drum pattern (which had been prefigured in Bium Bium Bambalo, the main template for the third album, in my view). Jonsi's falsetto is at its purest and most beautiful. A key to alot of the compositions on the album, and particularly this one, is the group's refusal to give too much, keeping things economic in terms of the melody. When the guitars kick in here, it's not a form of exaltation like on the previous album, or of intimidation and adrenalin, as on the final two tracks here, it's more as a statement of realisation, as a conclusion to a meditation. When I hear Ebow I keep thinking Jonsi's singing 'never, never die'. For this reason perhaps, I consider it to be an optimistic rather than a pessimistic piece of music. Which cannot be said of the following track, Dauoalagio (The Death Song). The first time I heard this thirteen minute masterwork, I was pretty much dumbfounded. It moves through its stages masterfully, with extraordinary intent. It rises and falls, with moments of deadly quiet and deadly noise, culminating in Jonsi's lonely voice, repeating the same phrase suggesting an entreaty to the gods, begging for mercy or salvation. Jonsi vocal comes to an intimate, emotional conclusion, then the memorable opening guitar line of Popplagid (The Pop Song) unfolds. This composition is certainly the best final track of any album ever, and almost always closes Sigur concerts. It rolls along for the first couple of minutes in a comfortable way, before Jonsi's voice starts to move its way upwards in anticipation of the wave of noise that soon crashes in with pounding drums. At times Jonsi's voice can be like a siren, wailing above the music, alerting the listener to forces of darkness swirling around us. It's certainly true on this piece. The composition sinks down once more, and we listen, waiting for the next tide of noise to swell, which it duely does. But what follows that is perhaps unexpected. We hear just the pounding drums on their own, then Jonsi's voice starts to murmur in the background. Then the drums stop and one is left with an insistent tugging electric guitar line. And Jonsi's cry becomes more insistent, more siren-like. Before the mammoth weight of the track finally kicks in with screaming guitars and pounding drums and Jonsi's repetitive cry. It's simultaneously one of the most exhilirating and terrifying moments in recorded music. The music can only come to a lurching, exhausted conclusion, which it does. And the album is finished. And the experience cannot be forgotten. Particularly the sequence from Alafoss to Popplagid. One of thekeys to the power of these compositions is the level to which they have been honed. Popplagid was regularly performed live as far back as 1999. Most of the other compositions had also been heard live for a few years before the album's release. Sigur allowed these songs to build to greatness through their repeated performance and natural evolution. Most groups would have released studio versions alot sooner, but Sigur wisely bided their time. Hopefully on the next album, we will hear studio versions of Salka, Gong, Milano and Gitardjamm, which are all brilliant compositions that have been regularly performed live. Sigur Ros are at the pinnacle of modern music as it stands. One can only hope they can invent even higher pinnacles for themselves. Sigur fans can anticipate nothing but this.
B00006CXXU|5.0|this is her best cd yet! there is not one song on this cd that i dont like and it is definetly worth every penny! if you decide to only buy one cd this year stripped has to be it. the songs are all amazing and really deep you can almost hear her voice break in one of the songs because its so emotional for her <br />she did an amazing job on this cd and it will be hard for anyone to make a better one
B00005JM0B|1.0|I am a huge fan of the first two. So I cannot stress enough what a huge dissapointment this movie was for me. I should have known something was wrong when i found out that james cameron did not direct this movie. Let me explain. This really is not a part 3.... its a sort of Terminator 2 REDUX!        Its basically the same story.. John Connor goes through all the same troubles accepting that terminators exist... and he teaches him not to be violent again... etc.. If I wanted to see terminator 2 I would rent it, or buy it... This is just a cheap knock off of the original. (Cheap special effects... the effects from part 2 are actually alot better!)      Acting= terrible.. ( John Connors got really dorky)      action sequences= look phony.      story= what story? nothing intriguing what so ever (if you already saw part 2)...    i think arnold simply made this movie because the name alone will make money (one last big payday)        I also want to mention how sorry i feel for those people who enjoyed this movie.  it doesnt even deserve one star!!!!       and yes kristina loken is hot. the movie is still terrible!
0780626966|5.0|I have been a fan of Nightmare on Elm Street for years, so when this came out, I had to have it. In fact, this collection is what precipitated the purchase of my first DVD player, but I digress. <br />  <br /> The collection is exquisite. &quot;Freddy's Dead&quot; contains the original, 3D ending, complete with two sets of 3D glasses. (Unless I'm mistaken, this film was the first movie ever released on DVD with an included 3D sequence.) I'll mention that I am one of those unfortunate people who cannot watch 3D without getting queasy. However, I did check out the 3D sequence, and it looked pretty impressive, nonetheless. The image also looked okay to watch without the glasses as well. <br />  <br /> There are some phenomenal extras in this collection. I spent several hours watching the different clips. Some are random, like sound bites of Freddy Krueger from MTV, while others are lengthy discussions, including one with Rachel Talalay where she laments the fact that the ending of #6 had to be shot in 3D because it greatly limited the special effects they could have done otherwise. <br />  <br /> The encyclopedia includes a very cool &quot;labyrinth&quot; game that can be entertaining. (As well as somewhat tedious, since you have to navigate with your DVD player remote.) There is also an alternate ending to the first ANOES buried deep in the game that is quite a treasure to find. <br />  <br /> The commentaries included (on #1 and #7) are also quite entertaining. Especially #1, which includes Wes Craven, a gentleman I can't recall at the moment, John Saxon, and Heather Langenkamp. Although Mr. Saxon barely spoke at all, it was very fun listening to Craven and Langenkamp speak about their experiences on the film. The only way it could have been better would have been to have Robert Englund sit in on it as well. (If only...) <br />  <br /> The only real downside I can think of about this collection is that the trailers are included on the Encyclopedia Disk and not on each individual movie's disk. Also, there is only one trailer for each film. The trailer for ANOES 3 is the trailer of the dollhouse with Freddy's arm shooting out of it. A very cool trailer, but I still would have liked to seen the one with actual footage from the movie included. <br />  <br /> This collection is definitely for the fan, even a casual fan, of the Nightmare on Elm Street series. I doubt it will win any naysayers or those flat-out not interested over, but for those with an interest in Freddy, it's fantastic.
0380789035|5.0|I haven't enjoyed reading a fiction book as much as American Gods since I can remember. I tried to savor it as best as possible and only read a chapter a night, but one night I lost control and stayed up till 4 a.m. reading it.<br /><br /> A lot of people in their reviews say things along the lines of &quot;Neil Gaiman should stick to comics&quot; and the like but they are totally wrong. Neil Gaiman is the BEST fiction writer of the 21st century.<br /><br /> The characters are great, the dialogue is great, the story is great and the twist at the end is great. Neil Gaiman, an Englishman, tapped into one of the core reasons America is special--we are a melting pot of cultures, and Gaiman uses that to his storytelling advantage. I can't say enough about Neil Gaiman. He really is a wonderful writer, both of comics and novels.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|It's been awhile since the days of grrl power on the inaugural Lilith Fair tour in 1997. And for the festival's founder, Sarah McLachlan, that's enough time to have experienced tragedy and joy, and then, of course, channel her reflections into a new album. The woman's an artist, after all. That said, McLachlan is returning to a different music scene than the one she left behind. Sarah's soulful comeback album, Afterglow, comes along at a time when many of us are spellbound by pop's candy-coated superstars -- but happily, this new release offers a welcome reprieve from the recent Madonna Makeout Mania.  <br />  <br /> An equally distant memory to the early days of Lilith Fair is McLachlan's last studio recording. In the six years since the release of Surfacing, Sarah lost her mother to cancer and gave birth to a baby girl, India. All things considered, Afterglow -- a smooth, lyrical reflection on what proves to have been a deeply transitional period -- is nothing if not aptly titled.  <br /> Here, the three-time Grammy winner delivers 10 new tracks that showcase the haunting quality of her voice. Though Afterglow lacks songs as memorable as &quot;Hold On&quot; or &quot;Building a Mystery,&quot; Sarah is still producing evocative music. The gravity of her lyrics in &quot;Stupid&quot; and &quot;World on Fire&quot; reveal that she's working through a laundry list of frustrations. But no matter how dark her words, the songs are tempered by a gentle lullaby quality that underscores the entire LP.  <br />  <br /> McLachlan also composes lush instrumental backdrops, and she lays them on thick. You almost have to peel away the layers of percussion and strings to hear the piano chords at the heart of every melody. But despite a little edgy electronica in &quot;Train Wreck,&quot; Sarah takes few risks, and steers clear of the upbeat pop sound that characterized her old records. In fact, the overall feel of the instrumentation is so warm and soft you'd imagine McLachlan wrote much of this album with her baby right by her side.  <br />  <br /> In short, if Sarah's older material made you feel introspective, Afterglow is certainly moody enough to bring out your pensive side once again -- heck, a few of these tracks might even make you want to have a good cry. But odds are likely it's the simple, soothing comfort of McLachlan's sound that will make you happy to hear from her again.  <br />  <br /> Final Verdict: It has its elements of predictability, but true fans will be content to bask in Sarah's Afterglow. <br />
B00005AFMT|5.0|Holy crap! Has this actually been on my Desert-Island-Five list for 21 years? I'm either getting terribly old and set in my ways (a possibility I'm not quite ready to embrace) or \\"Discipline\\" is one of the most enduring things to come out of the music industry in the last quarter century. Other favorites have come and gone, but this just never gets old. I continue to find every note, every line, every animal-like guitar squeal as exciting as it was when I first... ah... \\"borrowed\\" the LP from a boyfriend in '83. This is Robert Fripp at his talented best and Adrian Belew in all his unique and, well, just plain WEIRD glory. I never tire of their jangled, discordant romps through \\"Indiscipline\\" and \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet.\\" My frazzled nerves unclench to \\"Matte Kudasai\\" and \\"The Sheltering Sky.\\" Lines from \\"Elephant Talk\\" have saved me countless hours of slogging through the thesaurus and \\"Frame by Frame\\" is absolute perfection!    Buy, beg, borrow or steal this CD and shout with me, \\"LONG LIVE THE KING!\\"
B00005JMJG|5.0|I just wanted to comment on the cover of the DVD that is going to be released in later September. There's a quote on the front of it that says the movie is &quot;funny, sexy, romantic comedy!&quot; and it is, sure, but that's not what I got from the movie. If you are looking for a &quot;funny sexy&quot; romantic comedy, i don't know if the movie really is for you. I don't know why they put that quote on the front.  <br />  <br /> in conclusion, movie = amazing, dvd cover = huh?
B000002G7E|5.0|This album was the soundtrack to my wayward youth of hot nights and bleak windy days; this, in my opinion, is the greatest of Velvet Underground albums. It is guaranteed to invigorate the mighty few, horrify many and puzzle most. That's the way it ought to be. If stuff like this doesn't &quot;make you grow&quot; (and I quote William Orton Carlton) then forget it and forget you man! Is that a bit mean? So what! When you're ready to toughen up put this album on, then maybe follow it up with Mr. Reed's &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;. Take a walk on the really wild side! <br />  <br /> The album begins with the title track which is a tough 50's style rock and roll number with enough fuzz and distortion to make you want to whip out the switchblades! A catchy, hotcha number if there ever was one too and the fact that it's got a good tune should smack the faces of all detractors. Then comes &quot;The Gift&quot; an odd as hell little tale of modern suburban horror that features, on the modern hi-tech remix version, one stereo track of nothing but John Cale's deadpan Cymragean narration about a couple of stereotypical &quot;American&quot; suburban upper middle-class lovers. The other stereo side to this song is a sweet little churn of improvised psychedelia. This tune's great for mixing the hunch-punch in your dad's basement on a Saturday afternoon! Then comes the warbling, strange and spooky &quot;Lady Godiva's Operation&quot; which is, in my opinion, even creepier than the previous song with it's fluttering production, Lou Reed's punched-in vocals and desciption of some kind of ugly surgery on what I take to be a mindless beauty queen. Yeesh. Then it's &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot; which is actually a very beautiful tune, sublime and reminiscent of some of Leonard Cohen's works. After that is my favorite! Much of what I've read is negative concerning &quot;I Heard Her Call My Name&quot; but so freakin' what! If this song doesn't make you want to take up the war-hammer then there's no hope for that hair on your chest son (or daughter!). This is a mighty, stomping, relentlessly brutal tune that smashes and crushes everything in it's path: in other words it's great! Towards the end of the strange rant and blasting rythms there is one of the most shamanic, epochal guitar solos ever, as if Lou Reed was channeling electricity from beyond the galaxy, a mighty preternatural, yes, free-jazz styled wail. I love it! If you don't &quot;get&quot; it then move on, if you do then thump your chest in primal triumph! This one-two punch is followed by the Teutonic victory feast as the historical &quot;Sister Ray&quot; rumbles into audibility. What can be said about this 17-or-so-minute long epic that hasn't been said before? A tremendous battle between all instruments with ramblings about tough, questionable decadence is what this song is and by then end your brain should be a smoking crater.  <br />  <br /> I don't know what the Velvets were on or what they were smoking when they did this album but they created a monster of it in 1967! Maybe it was all about the internal conflicts that were heating up with the group at the time, it's hard to tell, but one thing I know is that this is one of the greatest rock and roll albums of all time!
076790592X|5.0|Mitch Albom captures the essence of what humans need: real compassion, love, and caring. He pieces it all together, as it was in the life of Morrie Schwartz, and places it into Tuesdays with Morrie.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I was in my mid teens when episode 3 came out and saw it probably a dozen times then. I was pretty excited when they rereleased it and was mildly impressed by the extras. Mostly it was really cool seeing it in the theatre I first saw it in back in 77'. <br />  <br /> I have no doubt the DVD in either form will be outstanding. As mentioned, it would be nice to have an original or extended option like the second T2 DVD release. <br />  <br /> I would also like to see a high definition version similar to the 3rd &quot;ultimate&quot; T2 DVD release. Not very many people were able to see the HD T2 verion simply because it required a fast pc by the standard of the time. They don't know what they missed. <br />  <br /> For those who are so critical of this release, I'm sorry you won't allow yourself to enjoy it as much as I know I will.
B00020X88O|4.0|Ok, so Showgirls has a pretty bad reputation. That's because most people just don't get it. It's a satire. Sure, there are some (possibly) unintentionally funny moments (and enough breasts to make people who complained after the last Super Bowl have a heart attack), but it is all good fun. If for no other reason, witness the acting power of Elizabeth Berkley, who went on to star in...er...some other stuff.  <br />  <br /> In addition to the DVD itself - which contains a number of features including a commentary by David Schmader (a man who isn't afraid to say he likes this film); a lap-dance tutorial; 'A Showgirls Diary'; trivia track and the original trailer - this V.I.P Edition comes with all the goodies you'll need for a Showgirls party. Two shot glasses; two pasties (most likely to be used after the two shot glasses have seen their share of liquid beverages); a blindfold (still not sure if this is a subtle comment on the film); a deck of cards (if you get really bored); and a big centrefold poster thingy, to play &quot;Pin the Pasties on the Showgirl&quot;. <br />  <br /> I ask you - does DVD collecting get any better than this?
B000002HRE|1.0|By now everyone actually knows what Metallica used to be, and what they turned out into in the 90s. Screw that...      What I would really like to see, is a personal music CD collection of a person who rates this abortion of an album 5 stars. I'd really like to talk to him or her, to know what they have been listening to in their lives, how their musical taste evolved, what they like and dislike, and what other CDs by Metallica grace their CD-shelves.      That's about all the interest that this album arouses in me.       So the obvious verdict is this: excellent Metallica started with &quot;Kill'em All&quot; and ended by the black album. Buy all 5 of them.      PS &quot;Unforgiven 2&quot; is quite good, though. Download it through a PTP service, so courthouse-lawsuit-happy Mr. Ulrich has another $15 lost! I hope he won't sleep. :)
B0000UJL96|4.0|From comments I originally published on: [...] <br />  <br /> Star Trek VI proved not to be the last Trek film (or the last with Shatner), but it was the last with the complete original crew. As such, it is a fitting end to the legacy of Gene Roddenberry's original vision (he died during production). <br />  <br /> I am an unashamed Trekkie, so a recommendation from me is probably not that convincing. However, I can safely say that this is not only one of the best Trek films to date, but one of the best sci-fi action films with a brain. Despite the daunting &quot;VI&quot; in the title, even if you know nothing of Trek, this film has something for everybody.  <br />  <br /> Now, some comments here have stated the print looks a little dirty. However, while there is some grain and a few artefacts here and there, I have to disagree. The film has an intentionally &quot;dirty&quot; look - both director Nicholas Meyer and production designers agreed on a much dirtier and more military/industrial look for this film, even with the more familiar sets on the Enterprise. For some, this may come as a stark contrast to other Trek films, and the pristine look of the ships in the newer TV series. Further, with supplements as good as this, that cover everything from modern philosophy to peacekeeping in a modern world, Paramount have given us one of the best Trek DVDs to date.  <br />  <br /> Highly recommended. <br />
0679777547|5.0|Many have compared this book to the Da Vinci code, I don't see it. I think the characters are much better in this book, and Perez Reverte goes more indepth on their motivations. Plus the translation is brilliant, the prose is beautiful! While the Da Vinci code was a faster paced affair. With both books I found myself running to the internet do research parts of the books I had just read. Great learning expierience from both books. Overall The Club Dumas was written better, and I found myself rooting for the characters more. Plus there were a couple laugh out loud momemts of dark humor I did not expect.
B00008LDPU|1.0|I regret watching the Animatrix film and am thankful I just borrowed it from a friend and didn't spend money. This type of film is, to me, what is wrong with Hollywood or mass market films in general. I found the short films to be in one of two categories: <br />  <br /> 1. A storyline that was better left to the imagination of the user. Nothing &quot;new&quot; is shown, it is kind of like a documentary about how something referenced in the movie came about. Most of these shorts are completely centered around the point that the human race is becoming too reliant on technology. This removes any thought or imagination from the moviegoer, something that was present in the first Matrix film but every successive release removes pieces. <br />  <br /> 2. An attempt to bring in some new angle to the story by proposing a new &quot;deep&quot; theory. All of these shorts just came off as confusing jumbles of random thoughts and images. You end up confused as the storyline makes no sence. The ones that do have a point aren't very interesting for all the work they put in to depict it. <br />  <br /> The quality of animation is quite nice. Like many of thse reviews have mentioned, the shorts are all done by different people so the styles are all different. That part of it, I found quite refreshing. <br />  <br /> This is not a DVD I would want to own, my recommendation if you really want to see it is a quick rental and low expectations. Otherwise you will be very disappointed.
B00005JLIU|5.0|The movie is great, a terrific spoof on the 1920's,really funny and with some great songs.As for acting,Julie Andrews and Mary Tyler Moore are SO GOOD! And Bea Lillie is,as always,brilliant. She was a comic genius.I don't see why some person complained about Jimmy Fox.He was perfect as Julie's boyfriend.And you can't compare this movie to &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.Two completely different kinds of film.Any perceptive person could see that.And now to answer the unfair criticism of Carol Channing.Sure,her acting was over-the-top,but the character of Muzzy IS over the top.Her singing is great,and she dances up a storm.A wonderful performance! To appreciate the artistry of Channing you must see her in person.She can enchant and hold an audience better than anyone I have ever seen on the stage.Her &quot;Dolly&quot; is sublime.She is one of the greats.I recommend this video to anyone who loves great fun,great songs,and smashing performances from all involved.Buy it,you won't be disappointed. <br />

B00005JNH0|1.0|While Spinal Tap was a rockumentary about a fictitious metal band, Some kind of Monster is for real. I don't think the creators of Spinal Tap could have or would have even conceived of a film like this, it is unbelievable and sad. This has absolutly no entertainment value in the least. Anyone who can claim to be a Metallica fan after seeing this is the same person who votes for Bush and say what a great job he's doing.<br /><br />This film is not out to make new fans, it couldn't. This film is another lame attempt at the once mighty Metallica to milk more money from the Metallisheep fans. Watching Lars sipping champagne while enjoying the auction is enough to make you vomit.<br /><br />I would have been happy just to see the Dave Mustaine portion in its entirity, uncut. That would have been worth the price of admission.<br /><br />I swear I cannot watch Cliff'em All and believe that this is the same band. Kirk is a lackey with no say or spine. James is a burntout, looking like a white trash, trailer park geek, Bob Rock should keep his mouth shut and go produce bubblegum bands like A-ha, and Lars, freakin' Lars, that arrogant little midget. His comment on Cliff Burton was the stupidest thing anyone has ever said in the history of mankind. Cliff had more talant in his pinky than Lars could ever hope to. The greatest bass player who ever lived died at age 24, and with him his sound. Fans from the 80's will never forget Cliff, newbies will never know what Metallica was all about.<br /><br />Lars has your money and he's laughing at the world. Pretty good for a tennis player from Europe who stole the name Metallica while being a Motorhead groupie. Put a fork in them, Metallica is long past done, they are overdone. They have nothing constructive to contribute to music, so quit already.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I have to admit that I have been monitoring the reviews of this barely debatable mockery, from near the beginning, and I find it suspicious that about half of the reviewers give this movie one star and the other half are giving it five stars but the overall rating has stubbornly remained a consistent four. Hmm. How very odd. <br />  <br /> I don't have the time to actually go through every review to create a mean score but it wouldn't surprise me if the rating is being electronically manipulated to ensure that one of most anticipated DVD releases of all time, will stay that way. How would it look to the younger fans, and potential fans, if a movie had a rating of 2 and a half and it hadn't even hit the shelves yet? Hmm. You don't have to be Yoda to tell that something doesn't add up. But I know that Amazon would never do anything so duplicitous or illegal. I could be wrong but the force has always been strong in my family.  <br />  <br /> BTW, don't buy this POS. If you want to watch a &quot;quality&quot; movie that epitomizes the real Lucas vision, watch Howard the Duck. To the younger, less informed fans, that last statement was sarcasm. <br />
B0000C8AW7|5.0|Bob Dylan was all but written-off as a vital, viable musician in the 1980s. But the last 15 years have witnessed a gradual and stunning rebirth of this timeless artist. 1989's &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; was a good album that hinted of greater things to come. Dylan's 1992 and 1993 acoustic covers gave him a chance to delve back into the roots of his (and all) music. His last two albums, 1997's &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; and 2001's &quot;Love and Theft,&quot; stand as evidence of a legendary singer/songwriter coming gloriously back into his own. <br />  <br /> I like &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; an awful lot. Song for song, maybe it's better than &quot;Love and Theft.&quot; But I prefer &quot;Love and Theft&quot; overall. Whereas &quot;TOOM&quot; is dark and brooding, &quot;L&T&quot; is a breath of fresh air. Bob's band is dead-on perfect here, leaping nimbly from blues to jazz to folk to rockabilly; and Bob's gravelly twang meets the music and the mood just as perfectly. I cannot describe how great it is to hear 60-year old Dylan (so famously prone to moroseness) sounding like a man and a spirit reborn. He gives his best vocal performance here in decades, finding rhythm in complex lyrics, where only he could.  <br />  <br /> I've always loved Bob's blues songs, and &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot; is one of his very best. &quot;Cry A While&quot; is musically fascinating with its stop-start tempo and inspiring lyrics. &quot;Po' Boy&quot; and &quot;Floater&quot; are quiet riots, stunning displays of Bob's vocal timing. (He's still got it, folks!) &quot;Mississippi&quot; is about as catchy as Bob gets these days. And the balance of the songs are wonderful, as well, though some work better live than they do on &quot;L&T&quot;.  <br />  <br /> Anyhow, a great success for a great musician/artist. &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; may have been Dylan's official comeback, but &quot;Love and Theft&quot; proves that &quot;TOOM&quot;'s success was no fluke. <br />
B000002UAX|5.0|This is probably the best-known musical collage in the world and with abunch of people this is the first thing they'll think of when you say sound collage and there is a good reason for that: it's one of the best. It has a strong sense of purpose, and it stays there. <br /> . <br /> The purpose of it is that it's a reinterpretation of the Beatles song &quot;Revolution&quot; (included) and that's what the first time listener would think because there is another reinterpretation of the song (&quot;Revolution 1&quot;) earlier on in the album. This is why the song took so many pop music fans by surprise. Although it was by far the weirdest piece on The Beatles, it is one of the best collages because it has two things that most collages always lack: focus (the song revolution), and exiting elements that pull the listener though all of its ten minutes of length.  <br /> . <br /> The common subtitle of the album, The White Album, was never intended to become the title of the record. It was added to the title when the album made it to cd because when the album is issued on record, there is nothing on the sleeve besides an embossing of the words THE BEATLES on the white cardboard of the record sleeve.  <br /> . <br /> I hope that you like the first of five collages (the last one is 9 parts and will need to be sent over email and Aim) that I'll be sending you throughout the week.
B00005JN2F|3.0|After becoming a great fan of &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (with Matt Damon, not the old original), despite Doug Liman's lame politically-charged reasons for filming it, I was glad to learn they were making a sequel. <br />  <br /> The acting was fine, and, like the earlier film, the cinematography and special effects were great. But why the hand-held camera? I thought Hollywood had learned that people don't like it so much and had given it up. After all, it was a new technique way back when NYPD started up on TV. It's a dated technique now. <br />  <br /> Buy a stinkin' tripod already! This movie only gives one good extended fight scene - after Damon had spent months practicing kali and boxing preparing for the filming of the first movie - and then the fight scene (with the German former assassin in Munchen)is ruined by use of handheld camera. You can't see what's happening! <br />  <br /> A couple of logic gaps in the plot were big enough to drive a Mack truck through. When the Russian agent finds Bourne in India, and assembles his sniper rifle from a bag, then fires it at Bourne's speeding vehicle across a bridge, both he and Bourne are surrounded by dozens of Indians all over the bridge. The Russian watches the catastrophic result of his shot, then presumably disassembled his rifle and stuffs it back in the bag, which we see him carrying once again as he calmly watches all these Indian people around him yelling about the demise of the Jeep Bourne was in. What -- none of them would have pointed him out as the culprit, when there were so many that some must have seen him? <br />  <br /> Then, when Bourne takes a train from Berlin to Moscow and the CIA finds out, they immediately notify Russian authorities, who somehow show up late at the train station to arrest him. Did the writers realize how long it takes even a high-speed train to travel from Berlin to Moscow? It's an overnighter, and at the very least the authorities could have had the train stopped somewhere along the way. But that wouldn't have worked with what they had written to happen in Moscow, so we get this ridiculous plot weakness. <br />  <br /> And what's with leaving Chris Cooper out of the credits? Sure, it was just a couple of cameos, but it was new footage of him playing Conklin. They put characters like the guy who played &quot;Second Policeman&quot; in the credits, but not Cooper. For some reason he tends to get overlooked; though he carried &quot;Lone Star&quot; on his shoulders, he got third billing under Kris Kristofferson and Matthew McConaughey, who played far lesser roles -- because they were more famous. Cooper always gets stuck playing the most difficult roles, because he does it so brilliantly well - then gets left out of the credits on the sequel of a movie he helped succeed.
0312243022|5.0|It was some time ago that I had first seen the Trailer's for the movie The Hours, later I was in the library, found the title, and the synapses connected.  <br />  <br /> To start, English and psychology are two of my strongest points, and Cunningham's (and originally Woolf's) Stream of consciousness writing appeals to both. The book can be summed up to this Paraphrased quote from the movie, &quot;One day in a woman's life, and in that day... her whole life.&quot; While some may think of this book as having no plot whatsoever, they fail to realize that they are reading just one day in three woman's lives. And all at once, within these 226 pages (Picador USA edition, movie poster front) Cunningham is almost required to throw every stroke of depression, every twinge of happiness, and every questioned thought, and every placed rock at you. Could this be too much for some? In all honesty, yes quite possibly. <br />  <br /> The Hours tells about Virginia Woolf's plotting out of her finest work, Mrs. Dalloway, Laura Brown's semi-obsession with the same book, as well as her struggle to try to be herself AND fit in with 1960's post-WW2 era times, and Clarissa Vaughan (-Dalloway's) parallel to VW's Mrs. Dalloway.  <br />  <br /> I find it refreshing that Cunningham rips open his three character's minds and plays show-and-tell with them, viewing them to the whole world.  <br />  <br /> To end, I highly recommend this book if the readers can KEEP A CLEAR, UNBIASED ATTITUDE ABOUT THEM. If the reader has problems with homosexuality (although to say any of the three characters, save Vaughan were 100% homosexual is going out on a limb), depression, or suicide this book is not for you.
B00006879E|4.0|Maroon 5 has brought introduced a new sound in music by fusing R&B, jazz and rock into their own brand of music. Indeed, I personally feel that Maroon 5 has given us music listeners something new; just like how Norah Jones in 2002/03 stormed with Come Away With Me. The main reason that Maroon 5 is doing so well is to do with its unique music, which no one else offers at the moment.    Adam, the lead singer of Maroon 5, has a very good voice and best of all, he uses it well on this CD. You won't find the usual hoarse voices of Nickelback or 3 Doors Down or Lifehouse. I find similarities between Adam's vocals and that of Justin Timberlake - perhaps even better.     I am a great fan of music and listen to almost anything. But I only purchase CDs that are worth keeping and listening to over and over again. This CD is that type of CD. One more thing - Maroon 5: expect Grammys next year.    Update 2005: What did I tell ya? Hail this year's Best New Artist at the Grammys.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have to say that this thing moved me. After finishing watching the episodes, I actually ached with sorrow that the series had been cancelled. I sort of felt like I'd been dumped.<br /><br />Wonderfully cast, superbly written, gorgeously rendered. Can't wait for the movie and can only hope Fox sees the light.
B0000931OG|5.0|Along with Joe Henry's &quot;Fuse,&quot; this is one of the coolest albums made in the past twenty years. While so many other big-market bands just keep trying to give the people what they want and taking it to the bank, Blur remains as restless as it is engaging. Of all the artistic twists and turns this band has dealt its fans over the years, this is probably the most successful of them all: a darkening forest of sound brimming with suspense and intrigue; an inviting sonic wasteland. The astonishing &quot;Ambulance&quot; manages to go in five directions at once while somehow staying focused, from its raunchy horn section to its sultry drum beats and keyboards. &quot;13&quot; and the band's eponymous 1997 album suggested even more ambitious aesthetical horizons, but hardly anyone could have foreseen such a dramatic change of paths as the one &quot;Think Tank&quot; paves. Even the band's own label misses the point, billing the generic &quot;Crazy Beat&quot; as the album's single. The rest of the record so thoroughly reinvents the band that the merely bellicose &quot;Crazy Beat&quot; sounds like a stale echo of long-gone days. The irresistible grooves of &quot;Brothers and Sisters,&quot; &quot;On the Way to the Club&quot; and &quot;Jets&quot; are so organic as to anticipate the sound of music centuries from now. This is that doomed art: a brilliance so radiant as to go unrecognized in its own time, waiting for rumors of its legend to swarm to ears of later generations.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I know most people proclaim Terminator 2 as the best of the trilogy.....however, my favorte will always be this little masterpiece for a couple of simple reasons:      1. James Cameron got his continuity right. The basic theme in the movie is: you cannot change the future, you can only hope to survive it. Everything someone does to alter the future will in turn, cause these events to occur. He carried this theme over to T2, but only halfway. But that's something I'll get into when I review that movie.      2. Whereas T2 and T3 were 'sci-fi/action' movies, the original Terminator was straight up 'sci-fi/horror'. The atmosphere in this movie is phenomenal and conveys the feeling of impending doom more clearly than the sequals.      In T2 when the T-1000 is chasing after the T-800/John Conner/Sarah Conner, you're thinking, &quot;Oh, man...they better run or they're screwed. I hope we get to see the two terminators fight again. That was sweet.&quot; But when the T-800 is stalking Sarah Conner through the police station in the original Terminator, we feel only despair for the characters. Never before has a man been so convincing as a machine. So cold and lifeless, yet moving with an uncontrollable desire to destroy anything that moves. That single sequence in Terminator was far unsettling and dramatic than anything I saw in the sequals.      In T3 when the T-800 gets his head knocked off and is only hanging by a few cables, we're thinking, &quot;Oh, wow...she took his head off.&quot; or, &quot;Hey, that's photo-realistic.&quot; But remember the bathroom scene in the original? Remember how freakin' scary that was? A damp, barely lit, grungy bathroom in a parking garage....a giant of a man stoicly slicing open his arm and PULLING OUT HIS OWN EYE. Yeah, even though the animatronic Arnold head looked extremely fake, the atmosphere was extremely creepy. I'll take style over photorealistic CGI any day.      I think what's so great about this movie is how you're slowly revealedthe true form of the Terminator. Piece by piece he loses a chunk here, a chunk there. You know he's a machine with flesh over his endo-skeleton, but the full force of this implication isn't really felt until you see the machine without the flesh emerge from burning wreckage. I find the scene where the endo-skeleton is lurching very quickly toward the door as Sarah is struggling to close it far more terrifying than the whole Terminator apocalypse scenes in the sequals. But then again, those are action movies. This original is a true sci-fi masterpiece and is probably the best sci-fi/horror film in existence second only to maby the original Alien.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|***1/2 Have you ever wondered how differently your life might have turned out had you taken a left turn instead of a right on the day of that fateful accident, or chosen a different college or career path, or not gone to that dance the night you met your one true love?  All of us have played this \\"what if\\" game at some point in our lives, speculating about where we might be, whom we might know and what we might be doing now if even a single event in our past had played out differently.  And how many of us would be willing to return to a key moment in our past if we knew that, by doing something different, we could forever alter the path our life ended up taking?  And what if we discovered that by undoing that event we ended up altering our lives and the lives of those around us in ways we never expected?  Would we still want to do it?<br /><br />This is the premise for \\"The Butterfly Effect,\\" an effectively creepy supernatural thriller that boasts a star-making performance by Ashton Kutcher.  Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a young man in college who, since his childhood, has been suffering inexplicable blackouts at key traumatic moments in his life.  And traumatic his life has been!  His father is consigned to a mental institution, suffering from an ailment that may have been passed on to his son.  In addition, Evan is friends with a young girl, Kayley, whose father sexually abuses not only her but Evan as well.  Kayley also has a sadistic little brother named Lenny, who inspires Evan, Kayley and a neighbor friend of theirs to perform malicious pranks and even sets Evan's dog on fire.  Now that he's in college, Evan discovers he has the power to transport himself back in time to many of these key moments in his life in an attempt to rewrite history and undo the mental and psychological damage they've caused.  The trouble is that Evan finds out that changing the course of history often brings a whole host of other unforeseen and unanticipated problems right along with it.<br /><br />Directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber have fashioned a complex, intricate screenplay filled with plot twists that continually alter the plane of the film's reality.  The story hurtles us back and forth in time, showing us what was, what is and then what might have been without a moment's confusion, all the while making us question whether Evan isn't simply insane after all.  There are a few, perhaps inevitable, plot holes, the most glaring of which is why Evan is unable to find out how a prank he and his friends committed in their childhood turned tragically wrong (Evan blacked out during the event).  Considering the fact that the tragedy was one that became common knowledge in the small town in which Evan lived, it is highly implausible that he would have to wait till his early `20's before he finally found out what had happened.  In addition, one might question the propriety of using a topic as sensitive as pedophilia for a supernatural thriller.  Still, those are minor quibbles for a story that works remarkably well at keeping itself credible and focused despite the inherent absurdity at its core.<br /><br />Kutcher does an effective job carrying the film.  By not being too handsome or too heroic, Kutcher keeps Evan life-sized and interesting.  We're willing to follow him through this elaborate labyrinth because we can identify with the truths of his character.  He's a young man who genuinely wants to make things better for the people he cares for, yet the mental anguish he is going through as he attempts to piece together some semblance of comprehensible reality from the jumbled fragments of his life comes through loud and clear.<br /><br />\\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is not your usual mind-numbing, schlock thriller.  It has intelligence and style and a very intriguing storyline.  It will probably get you rewinding some of those key events in your own life, wondering might have been.it. <br /> <br />Directors Eric Bress and J.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|Great follow up to Brave New World. Easily one of their best. The 3 guitar attack comes to the fore, with more harmonies and clearly distinguishable solo styles (KILLER solos from Adrian). The melodies and quiet build ups are there and just show the maturity of the band and a breadth of songwriting. Bruce and Steve are brilliant as always. The production is fantastic, the variety of songs is spot on. Whilst younger 'metal' bands sound tired and old, Maiden kick their botty's, not sounding like they've just made an album to make money, this sounds like they are actually getting into what they are playing. Yeah, there are a couple of slightly weaker tracks (per usual), but that's only because the others are so strong. Metallica, Slayer, Queensryche, Judas Priest, etc TAKE NOTE. The only other old bands blazing a quality trail like this are Bad Religion (and King Crimson).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you haven't seen this series, and you consider yourself a sci-fi fan, then you're missing out!!!!  This show is a must see. <br />
B0000024KQ|5.0|This album has to be in the top 25 of greatest rap cd's ever. In my opinion BACDAFUCUP by onyx is in the top 5. All We got iz us is the grimiest of the 3 real onyx cd's (disincluding triggernometry and bacdafucup 2). It has sick and dark beats and a lot more reference to death. The most popular song is problably Last Dayz, if you've seen 8 mile the beat is used during a freestyle. Shout is a classic loud onyx screaming song which is nicely done. Betta off dead is probably the worst song on the album just cause of the beat which is just the word &quot;onyx&quot; turned into a beat. Live Niguz is my favorite song on the album. Then everything from Most Def to Walk in New York are AWESOME. Lots of people forgot about Onyx cause of all the bitchass rappers now a day who cant even flow, so pick up some onyx
B00028HBKM|5.0|The Passion of The Christ is the most powerful and meaningful movie I've ever seen in my life.  I praise the Lord for this movie.  Yes, it's graphic, but it's what really happened.  Jesus suffered a brutal death for us...that we may have life and be restored to a right relationship with God the Father.  Talk about a loving sacrifice.
B000022TSY|5.0|Easy Rider is definitely a movie for its period. There's no doubt that the film was a free-wheeling, pot-smoking, and other illicit drug type of movie that reflects the period that was - the counter-culture, anti-Vietnam War, and anti-establishment 1960s that came from the age of baby boomers. Peter Fonda's &quot;everything goes&quot; production was effective in producing a spontaneous film that has allowed continued analysis by scholars and anyone interested in the tumultuous period that was.<br /><br /> The behind the scene commentary was interesting and insightful. Both Dennis Hopper and Fonda offered much discussion about the making of the film that reveals how difficult and how real the actors experienced what was happening in the southern part of the United States during the late '60s, which was much more intense -- bigotry and animosity towards the hippie or &quot;long-haired&quot; culture.<br /><br /> The cinematography was excellent. The road scenes were just gorgeous, and the motorcycle drive through New Mexico was quite impressive. The most chilling scene was the ending with the panning out of the camera that gave a somewhat dark feeling that might depict a scene from war torn Vietnam. Or maybe a false sense of hope of a generation that fought for freedom.<br /><br /> Besides the film's look, one cannot forget the soundtrack of the movie. It included a diverse selection of artists, and who can forget the Steppenwolf's overplayed Born To Be Wild, which opens the movie? Other than that, music of The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix, and Bob Dylan captured the film.<br /><br /> The is a film that has survived the times and should be viewed.
031218087X|2.0|Cliched: I loved DaVinci code but this not the same class of novel. The writing is riddled with cliches, I expect the phrase &quot;he turned on his heel&quot; in high school essays but not a best seller. <br />  <br /> Predictable: <br /> The plot was almost totally predictable. I think I figured it out after a couple of dozen pages. Usually with a Dan Brown novel it's the guy you least suspect that has a hand in it. So save yourself the trouble and just look for that character early on. <br />  <br /> Unrealistic: <br /> The idea of a graphical display of the hackers penetration is laughable. If you can identify them you can stop them. <br />  <br /> Tedious: <br /> The hunt for the **** was tiresome in the extreme. It seemed contrived to spin out a few more pages of the middle of the novel. <br />  <br /> I am amazed that reviewers like this stuff. I will stick to reading Houlbecq in french, who seems the only worthwhile modern author. <br />  <br />
0679428895|3.0|1 star = abysmal; some books deserve to be forgotten<br /><br />2 star = poor; a total waste of time<br /><br />3 star = good; worth the effort<br /><br />4 star = very good; what writing should be<br /><br />5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with others<br /><br />STORY: The young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus has just taken charge of the Aqua Agusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to a quarter of a million people in nine towns around the Bay of Naples...including Pompeii. When things start going amiss with the water supply his investigations throw him in the middle of a disaster not just from nature but also from men who would stop him from knowing the truth about the water supply.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />1) CHARACTERS - First I needed to realize that I was listening to the abridged audio version. Even with that I enjoyed the main protagonist but I also found the rest of the cast to be backdrop. But I also realize the book is called Pompeii and the story is really about that part of the world more than the people in the midst of this historic disaster.<br /><br />2) SETTING - I definitely felt like I was in the Bay of Naples at this time in history. Enough detail is given to develop the right picture in one's mind but not too much that I just wanted the author to get on to other things. It appears he did his homework and delivered the right words for the overall setting.<br /><br />3) PLOT - How does one tell a natural disaster story? Not an easy question to answer and the fact that Harris chooses to take the story from the perspective of the aqueduct maintenance man shows ingenuity, creativeness and originality. At no point did it occur to me that something wasn't plausible or believable. I enjoyed the quest the protagonist had in his effort to wade through corrupt officials and the challenges of nature. Even though I didn't care for the characters that much, the story propelled me along at an even pace giving me enough suspense at the impending doom to want to know what happens next.<br /><br />OVERALL: It is a solidly good story. Not great, but worth reading.ense at the impending doom to want to know what happens next.<br /><br />OVERALL: It is a solidly good story. Not great, but worth reading.
B000002LR6|5.0|I love this album.  It is industrial metal.  I have listened to as much of Ministry's stuff as I can get my hands on and I think that this is the best of it with Land of Rape and Honey coming a close second.  I also love their older album, Twitch.  I bought a promotional copy of Twitch on vinyl many years ago and am sad to say I have no way to play it.  I am not really impressed with anything after Psalm 69 but of course, anything by Ministry is decent enough.  Psalm 69 was so good you just can't compare it to anything other than Rape and Honey.
B000002WU9|5.0|Someone who said the new Raekwon album is better then this must be crazy, on all the Wu &quot;Solo&quot; albums it is evident that the clan is still tight because yes there are multiple Wu members one every track but aint nothing wrong with that. The best cuts on this album include: Crimonology, Incarcerated Scarfaces, Rainy Dayz, Ice Cream and Wu Gambino. In my opinion it's one of the top 25 albums of rap all time and is the second best Wu release next to Entering the Wu
B00022PZ60|5.0|Yes, we all know this movie sucks but frankly i'm surprized that nobody's talking about all the games that this v.i.p edition has to offer...<br />First you got this \\"pin the strings on the stripper's nipples\\" game that includes the poster, a blindfold, and two stringy things. There's also a drinking game attached to it, but don't you need shot glasses for that? Yes, and two of them are included as well!! <br />Second, you got poker cards with the \\"Showgirls\\" logo on them!<br />Thrid thing includes a bunch of collectable cards from the movie that all have different games to play in back of it, most of them dealing with drinking or sex!<br />And the last thing included in this awesome set is unfortunately the actual movie but don't worry, you won't be missing much if you just dispose of it.<br />So there you have it, 5 stars for the boxed set and it's price (worth every penny) but a big 0 for the film!!<br />ENJOY!!
1573228737|4.0|Please do yourself a favor -- if you like historical fiction, and especially if you like Victoriana, read this book. You won't be sorry; it's among the best of the best.<br /><br /> Now, do prepare yourself for the fact that there is not a lot of action in this book, beyond psychological action. It's a thinking person's book. However, it is quite suspenseful and the characters are fascinating, so you won't mind the fact that the events aren't happening at the speed you may be used to.<br /><br /> I gave this book four stars and not five because of some uneven editing in the book, especially in the antagonist's diary entries.<br /><br /> Overall, however, this book is top-notch. Read it and like it very much.<br /><br /> BTW, this isn't a &quot;lesbian book&quot; as it is often billed. There's nothing sexy in this book, and nobody comes out of the closet as a lesbian; it's all implied.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|I am writing this on the fly with no editing, because I feel I must respond to those who are knocking this album . . .<br /><br /> I'm just guessing, but most of those who rated this album low are probably &quot;old-school&quot; Rush fans who secretly wish for the days of 2112 or Hemispheres (25+ years ago). Yes those times were grand indeed, but here's a revelation: Rush has evolved and matured from common hippie-ish rockers into masterful modern musicians, and this recent live effort is utterly phenominal because they continue to grow and mature. It's time to wake up and realize that Rush has moved on to more brilliant successes since Tom Sawyer.<br /><br /> I highly recommend this incredibly energetic album. My goodness, the crowd is singing along with an instrumental for gosh sakes! What unbelievable enthusiasm! And it's all generated by one of the greatest bands of all time, performing at their peak like a fine wine - - - better with age. And they resurrect many of the aging Rush tunes of the 70's and 80's and make them powerful once again to a new generation of fans. Don't blame this album for that.<br /><br /> There is also a nice documentary that takes you inside the trio's thoughts, and how they prepare for a show; very informative.<br /><br /> Ever since Neil's recovery from his tragedies, Rush has come back to life, and this album proves it again. Do not be mislead by those skeptics trapped in 1977 - Rush one again proves that they (for as long as they wish) are always a force to be reckoned with in any genre, any age, and/or any musical period. That's their strength.<br /><br /> You will not be disappointed with this album.
B00005JN2X|5.0|A hired killer comes into L.A. Five hits are on his list. How does he get to them all in one night? He hires a taxi. Tom Cruise plays Vincent, the killer. Jamie Fox plays Max the driver. Together, they go from one end of the city to the other, wreaking havoc, as Max tries to somehow get away and stop the carnage. But Vincent would have no compunctions about killing him or his mother, in the hospital and totally helpless. <br />  <br /> What can he do anyway? He's a man with dreams, but who has driven a cab for 12 years, telling himself and others that he has big plans and one day he'll give up this &quot;temporary&quot; job. Vincent taunts him as being someone who will never do anything with his life, as one after the other, the targets fall to the killer's gun. But the last one, means something to Max. Will he finally make a commitment, do something, be proactive instead of being acted against? Can anyone go up against a stone cold killer who knows his business and has never failed? <br />  <br /> Both Cruise and Fox are well cast in this thriller and Jada Pinkett Smith is believable as the woman who appears then disappears from Max's life. The tension ebbs and flows, then builds to a crescendo, only to rise again. A bizarre moment occurs when two coyotes appear in the night streets and one has to wonder if it's some sort of mirage. For the most part, this film will leave you breathless and perhaps wondering about your own values as you sympathize with the characters.
B000002OVJ|5.0|When it comes to declaring your favorite classic rock and roll band, one sounds like a wimp or, at the very least, one who really dosen't have a true personal opinion if you pick the Beatles of the Rolling Stones. These two bands are so firmly rooted in the Rock godhead that even making them subject to such a decision feels like heresy. That's why God gave us The Who.<br /><br />The only problem with this picture is that it relegates The Who to no better than number three in the universe of British Invasion greats, let alone the world of Rock in general, and, as one of their biggest fans, I require more for my very favorite quartet of English pop musicians. To compensate for this position in the shadow of the Beatles and the Stones, I grant The Who one of only two bands to produce an honest to gosh work in a classic form, the Opera, using the Rock idiom. In fact, they did it twice with both `Tommy' and `Quadrophenia' in creating an opera with not only a genuine Rock band and instruments, but with one of the legendary bands of the British Invasion era. In case you are wondering, the only other work I believe is worthy of this distinction is Spooky Tooth's `Ceremony'.<br /><br />Now that we have established that I believe The Who to be just slightly lower than gods, I have to up the ante and claim that `Live at Leeds' is hands down one of the very best live Rock and Roll albums ever recorded. My recollection of the story surrounding the production of the album is that Pete Townshend and his chums toured England and the world for several months and recorded every note at many different stops with the intention of creating a live album from the very best takes. The problem was that when they sat down in front of the hundreds of recordings, they simply had no idea where to start, what to include, and what to throw out. So, the packed up all their recording gear to record a single concert at Leeds, England, a rather ordinary city of industry and working class people. I believe the result could not have been better.<br /><br />This album was recorded about a year after the release of `Tommy', but it contains only one long selection from that seminal work. The other thirteen cuts span their entire output up to, but not including the album `Who's Next' which always, in my mind, marked a change in the Who's basic style from Live band to Studio band, especially after the loss of Keith Moon. The only cut I cannot place on one of their classic albums is the first, entitled `Heaven and Hell', written by the greatly missed John Entwistle, released on the B side of the `Summertime Blues' single. Every other cut is pure gilt edged Who, with the original four lads at their ear-splitting, heart-pounding best.<br /><br />In case you may not know it from this great distance in time, The Who were one of the very greatest live performing bands in their era, and I saw them live just after the release of `Tommy', about a year before this album was recorded and, I can honestly say that they are one of the very few live performances which lived up to the intensity one generally associates with a live Rock show. In this same period, I saw Jim Morrison and the Doors, Frank Zappa, Jimi Hendrix, and Eric Clapton with Derek and the Dominos, and while the experience of seeing all of these legendary performers was satisfying, it was often less than electrifying. The original The Who including Keith Moon was electrifying in live concert.<br /><br />One of the very best things I like about the original The Who as a group is that it is almost perfectly balanced between the talents of the four. Leader, lead guitar, and principle songwriter Pete Townshend leaves the limelight on stage to singer Roger Daltrey, who does the greatest impression I know of what we all believe to be the performance of a rock star. John Entwisthe is the anchor, who keeps everything nailed down on base, while Keith Moon is the force which threatens to spin off into the second balcony. Keith Moon may not have been the very best rock drummer, but I dare anyone else to venture an alternative for that title with some very serious evidence. Moon was hands down the fastest, getting a faster beat with single sticking than most professional drummers can achieve with double sticking.<br /><br />Even a conservative evaluation of this album must place it among the top five live rock albums of all time. For Who diehards, this is pure gold.ock drummer, but I dare anyone else to venture an alternative for that title with some very serious evidence.

B00006J9OT|5.0|Unlike some of the other reviewers I loved the &quot;new&quot; sultry, Diana and her offerings. This, however, is probably much closer to the &quot;true&quot; Diana Krall than some of those offerings. Unlike the current crop of rap &quot;stars&quot; (making millions with their celebration of poverty), artists like Diana Krall,Jane Monheit, Tierney Sutton and Cheryl Bentyne actually KNOW the music - both theory and performance.  <br />  <br /> Krall, in addition to being a fine pianist and a top-of-the-line vocalist is also actively involved in arrangment and composition (as are the others mentioned above). This performance is one of the best, carrying that atmosphere and sense of presence that only a live outing can do. Once again, the melding of her voice and piano with the band says it all- arrangements are crips and never &quot;wandering&quot;, her rather odd intonation is near perfect. <br />  <br /> The album improves on repeated listenings as all good recordings do.
B0002KQNL8|2.0|If you loved the gore, &quot;black&quot; humor and overall tone of the first &quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot; then you had better prepare yourself for a disappointment.  &quot;Return of the Living Dead part II&quot; is in some ways a &quot;re-imagining&quot; of the first film (think &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; remake.) They even cast James Karen and Thom Matthews (&quot;Frank&quot; and &quot;Freddy&quot; in the first film.) They essentially play the same characters, go through the same ordeal and end up the same way....only without the sadness and horror of the process. The pathetic thing is that they even used dialogue from the first film word-for-word! William Stout, production designer from the first film, was offered the same job on the sequel and he turned it down based on that fact alone.  &quot;Return of the Living Dead part 2&quot; doesn't take itself seriously at all, in fact it's something of a parody of a parody much in the same way that &quot;Gremlins 2&quot; related to the first film. It's all comedy (and occasionally bad comedy to boot. Please note the &quot;Thriller&quot; zombie at the end played by Brian Peck -who was also in the first film- he walks in front of the camera, dead center hitting his spot and does his thing. Incredibly amateurish.)  This sequel is rather insipid and bland with cheap horror FX, jokes that fall flat and an attitude that says &quot;We don't care if you loved the original, we just want the title to make money off of.)  Still, there are *some* things to like, notably the performance of James Karen who is absolutely hilarious. He is an absolute joy to watch in every scene he's in. Thom Matthews, on the other hand, looks like he's in it only for the money. (Side note: Clu Gulagher, who played &quot;Burt&quot; in the first film, auditioned for the doctor but failed to get the part!)  I know it looks like I hate the movie but I don't...honest! It's just a world apart from the original. The filmmakers took a great concept created by Dan O'Bannon and basically threw it all out except the zombies and Trioxin. It's a bit sad really (and the less said about &quot;Return of the Living Dead 3&quot; the better.)  For diehard fans, you might be interested in knowing that the upcoming DVD might feature a slightly different version of the movie. In the past few months, various movie channels have aired a new version that features an altered soundmix with different songs and an alternate beginning that features narration explaining the story.  What we DO know about the upcoming DVD is this - Warner Brothers announced that the DVD will feature: a brand new anamorphic widescreen transfer, audio commentary by director Ken Wiederhorn & co-star Thor Van Lingen, theatrical trailer. Also the DVD will be in a keep case and NOT a snapper! That's about it.  Fans of this sequel will snatch this DVD up quickly BUT if you loved the original and have NOT seen part 2, I strongly suggest you rent *before* buying.
6305897786|1.0|There are a lot of reasons why I went to see The Ninth Gate. Perhaps top on the list is because the director, Roman Polanski, is the man responsible for the highly disturbing, yet artistically sound Rosemary's Baby. But it's also because of the movie's subject matter, i.e. Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies, Lucifer, and Mr. Boogedyman...whatever you choose to call him. Satan.<br /><br /> You can take a look at the past, oh, twenty-five years, and it's amazing how Satan's popularity fluctuates in pop culture. With movies like Dracula, Rosemary's Baby, Prophecy I & II, and End of Days forming the backdrop of our modern experience, it seems like today's society finds the subject fascinating, if not &quot;cool.&quot; Satan movies are all the rage. So I went to The Ninth Gate to see if the subject matter gets the same distressing treatment found in End of Days-to see if Polanski didn't sacrifice plausibility for pizzazz.<br /><br /> He did.<br /><br /> The flick follows book dealer/con artist Dean Corso as he attempts to verify the authenticity of a book for book collector/Satan-lover Boris Balkan (who is also filthy rich). The book is called The Ninth Gate, and it was supposedly written by the devil, who even drew the cute little pictures found in the pages. The theory is that if you get all the pictures together and speak some rudimentary Latin, the Dark Angel himself will pop up and shoot the breeze with you for a while. In a twist of what I suppose is irony, the motto of the book found on the title page reads: &quot;Thus let the light shine.&quot; That nutty Satan! He's all into irony.<br /><br /> What is redeeming about this film? Two things. The tone, for one, is good. Polanski didn't rush himself, and so he reproduces the same eerily hushed quality found in Rosemary's Baby. Johnny Depp, playing Corso, delivers a well-measured performance in sync with the movie's atmosphere. Unfortunately the tone of the movie demands substance. This film has none. It relies so much on the weight of its subject matter that the audience members are left essentially clueless on some basic plot points.<br /><br /> A lot of reviewers are going to harp on the &quot;artistic integrity&quot; of this film, and to its credit, the cinematography and editing are excellent. But good timing and restraint are not workable substitutes for a decent story. Depp's character starts the movie with the type of noncommittal attitude necessary for the plot, but by the end, his indifference is reflected by the audience. Polanski mistook confusion for art. When there's not a strong story to guide the mood, even the best craftsmanship becomes meandering nonsense (see Eyes Wide Shut).<br /><br /> However, even with the mish-mash of supernatural gumbo, even with the unfortunate and undecipherable ending, and even with the cartoonish side characters more fitting for a Sandman comic book, the movie at least doesn' t TOTALLY glorify Satanism. I'm all for dissing the devil's fan club. Most worshippers of the devil, it seems to say, are self-indulgent whiners who just need an excuse to hold orgies. What a burn.<br /><br /> But that's one brief, fleeting moment in the film. It's an instance of inflated self-awareness that loses steam fast. Polanski gets his jabs in on the devil's followers, but the conclusion of the film makes him seem sympathetic toward the devil himself. As if his acceptance of Satan wasn't enough to distance the movie from the typical non-evil-promoting viewer, that very acceptance is so clouded in distraction and &quot;artistic integrity&quot; that the only thing getting burned when the credits roll is the audience.lies so much on the weight of its subject matter that the audience members are left essentially clueless on some basic plot points. <br />  <br /> A lot of reviewers are going to harp on the &quot;artistic integrity&quot; of this film, and to its credit, the cinematography and editing are excellent.

014028009X|2.0|I purchased this book a while back, but can't say that I'm a proud owner. When I first read the book it didn't seem so brainless, but the second time around, I couldn't fathom how such brain-stunting material could have spawned almost an entire new breed of &quot;women's novels.&quot;
0060930187|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time, and contrary to popular belief, Sylvia Plath is not crazy; she is simply honest.  Any teen, adolscent or post-adolscent girl can identity with Esther's plight because it is their own, and anyone who says otherwise is a liar.  Plath's novel takes you places where you may not want to go; but, they are places where every woman has been before at some point in her life.  Even if you've never been haunted by the prospect of suicide, you know how it feels to have life close in, leading you to toy with the idea of crawling under a rock and quickly disappearing from the rest of the world.  You know what it's like to be afraid of living because one more day in the world is one more day you have to deal with an overbearing mother, a snoopy peer or a demanding boyfriend.  Every girl gets trapped in her own private bell jar.  Esther goes through all these things and any woman can easily relate, whether she wants to admit it or not.  I must say that this is far and away the most bare and honest novel I have ever read.  I could almost hear the wheels of psychosis churning around and around in Esther's head.  Plath is a genius and expresses her brilliance ever so beautifully in this masterpiece of hers.  FIVE BRIGHT GLEAMING STARS!  A MUST READ FOR WOMEN EVERYWHERE!
0800177975|4.0|I think I know why this film was so poorly received and tanked at the box office. It was TOO &quot;inside&quot;. Much of this film is a series of jokes about the standard, conventional, formulaic, bombastic action film genre. But the humor was so tongue-in-cheek so often that it probably didn't bode well with the average action-junkie film fan. &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; made fun of itself as it unfolded, and one would need a certain sense of humor to fully appreciate it on its intended level. I dare say that most folks who went to this film just didn't &quot;get it&quot;. Too bad for them.<br /><br /> The major flaw of the DVD is that the film is presented in the god-awful Pan and Scan format. Pan and Scan presentations of frenetically-shot widescreen films should be outlawed, it's just that simple. You almost get a headache watching this P&S version. The digital pan is so obtrusive and distracting that it can drive one to anger! It pulls you out of the film, to say the least. I like (but don't really love) this film, and the low price of the DVD makes the purchase a no-brainer. But it is too optically uncomfortable to watch in P&S.<br /><br /> Release it in widescreen and all will be okay.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron Maiden is just unbeleivable. They are of one THE metal bands, no denying. They recorded countless classics in the glorious 80's, and even in the 90's they did not sell out to grunge or rap metal. But this is their masterpiece, their most unbelievable album since Powerslave. Nothing is filler here! it's all classic-sounding, almost gothic metal from the true Gods of Metal. The 3-guitar lineup is just as, if not more, incredible than on Brave New World. I tell all of you to ignore the negative reviews on this album, because anyone who does not like this album must be sick. Keep going, guys, and I LOVE THIS ALBUM! MAKE MORE LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0780631684|4.0|If you really want to scare someone, don't tell them another &quot;guy with a hook&quot; campfire story. Skip the urban legends and cheesy ghost story fare. Because what really scares people is real life.<br /><br /> Go through the list of every possible way to die in any given situation. Mention how easy it is for a plane engine to fail, or a car to break an essential part. Comment on the plethora of common household items that, if they were to be involved in just the right coincidences, might result in your death.<br /><br /> If you really want to scare someone, take them to Final Destination.<br /><br /> The lead character, a high schooler named Alex Browning, is waiting on-board an international flight to Paris along with almost 40 of his classmates. During the wait, Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up. He ditches the flight, taking several classmates and a teacher with him in the broil his panic incites. These precious few have their lives changed when, sure enough, the airplane explodes just after claiming the skies.<br /><br /> The premise: those people were supposed to die, and now Death is simply getting caught up on his list. This means there is no killer, there is no hockey-masked looney with a rubber knife. There is a slight breeze, a brief, anamolous shadow, and then, you're dead.<br /><br /> The craftsmanship here is excellent. The deaths are all very disturbing, all very real, and all very brutal, and the effect is nauseatingly refreshing. We don't see hysterical people running up the stairs to escape a never-tired creep, or jabbing meat thermometers into supernatural critters. We see a pattern of easily explained, perfectly normal, lethally designed events that not only cause death, but also adapt to the victim's movements. No matter where they go, death is at their heels, following them in the endless coincidences. And it's all the more terrifying because it's supposed to happen, and there's no one to fight. The most any of the characters can hope for is that Alex will predict it and, perhaps, intervene in time. Needless to say, Alex's track record for saving his friends drops drastically post-plane crash.<br /><br /> The acting, though excellent, is a bit forced at points, and there are parts of the movie created solely to pad the film. A cringe-worthy expository interlude with a cheesy mortician and some repetitive dialogue are the only weak links in the show, however. The very concept of the flick is so interesting that it laminates all the duller moments.<br /><br /> The premise is, of course, self-destructive. Death can't die so no matter how many times the characters manage to cheat the traps that seem to be laid for them, sooner or later, the chain of events will be set in motion all over again. It doesn't end until they die. This type of problem might have crippled most horror movies, but Final Destination cleverly eludes the chance of a weak and long-overdue ending by cashing in on the repetitive &quot;tag-you're-dead&quot; quality of the plot. It ends with the understanding that it hasn't ended.<br /><br /> Not for the squeamish of heart, this movie is a landmark in the horror movie genre. Although it's not going to win any Oscars anytime soon, this well-timed and moodily constructed film does exactly what movies are intended to do: it entertains. It reveals the possibility that villains are all well and good, but the true horror lies in real death, in a murderer that exists in every inanimate object you come across.<br /><br /> Oooh.

0767800958|5.0|A fantastic, inventive, unexpected, energy laden salute to the dance. The dance... <br />The music is divine, Latin, intense, dramatic, haunting then joyful. The images, all excellent, well done and as they should be. The cities of Paris, London, and Buenos Aires, each in its own milieu; with sound effects of music, rhythm, the human voice, in languid love song, or in French vocal combat, perfection upon the ear. <br />It's a stretch, to follow the artist's imagination, into convolutions which lure then baffle you. Her intentions are to find the shape of her creation, within the creation, and to give it shape in that place. <br />The rounded square staircase, looking down four floors from above, opening outward like a grand snail shell, into that mysterious place above. The staircase, and the view from below of the great geometric layers of stone, where flickering in and out of color and form, ideas suggest themselves--try to struggle into life. <br />Elation grows from this food, it is fulfilling one. Knowing now to weave together life with life, without loss. To nourish one's own need for inspiration. The beauty can be summoned back again and again, living in its own joy. We ration ourselves too poorly in this...
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I miss Ross Robinson raw, loud and organic production. This Rick Rubin's produced Slipknot is mellow as the Red Hot Chilli Peppers!I remember they mentioned on an interview that Ross was the 10th member of the band...so i would like to believe that this isn't a true Slipknot album since one member is missing.I'm not dissing them, but Robinson's production makes all the difference in the world when it comes for this band's (once killer) sound.In my oppinion this new album can be considered the Slipknot's Black Album. It has some heavy tunes but that is nothing compared to their prior work. Hell, there's even some slow moments that sounds like a true ballad.It's their fault they accostumed me with the most aggressive metal sound i ever listened to in Slipknot and Iowa.Well, since this isn't the real Slipknot with Ross Robinson i figure this isn't a real Slipknot record.
B000286S8S|2.0|Luckily, I never bought Best of Vol I. So this is a better value for me than others. I am satisfied with the song selection from the Roth era, which is the only thing I was interested in. Like others have noted, Roth and Hagar each serve a different audience that have little in common. Roth VH caters to the traditional long-haired hard rock demographic of the early-80s and Hagar VH is for the trimmed and primped top 40 radio audience.  <br />  <br /> Bearing the above in mind, that brings me to my main beef with this compilation - why on earth did they interlace each track with a different vocalist, i.e. Roth, Hagar, Roth, Hagar, Roth, Hagar, etc. That is beyond annoying! You have to buy both disks with the package. Why does the record company care if you only end up listening to one of them? They still get their money. It's like they're telling me &quot;you better listen to Sammy, too, or he might feel bad.&quot; <br />  <br /> Now I have to burn all the Roth tracks on to a CD-R in order to avoid pressing the skip button on my stereo remote every four minutes (not to mention switching from disk 1 to disk 2). The three new tracks are not very impressive. The guitar playing is heavier but sounds tuned way down. The lyrics are completely moronic. Way immature for guys in their fifties. I would rather have 'Beat It' on here than 'Up for Breakfast.' <br />  <br /> Not worth $20 in my estimation. (I got it for $14.99 by the way.) <br />  <br />
B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil are one of the best bands to come out of recent years. They hail from Milan, Italy, which is rather unusual for a metal band. They have two singers, a female one (Cristina Scabbia), and a guy one (Andrea Ferro). The sound is really 80's goth hard rock, with a lot of synthesizers. Don't believe people who classify them along with nu metal bands such as Slipknot or Evanscene. They have more of a classic goth sound. Not at all nu metal. The two singers voices blend perfectly. Cristina's voice is angelic and light, while Andrea's sounds a lot like James Hetfield's. This is one great album, and I think everyone should own it.
B00003CXFV|3.0|Julia Roberts is like the vanilla ice cream of movies. Everyone pretty much likes her more or less, and for a dessert, she'll do in a pinch.<br /><br />And I don't mean that literally.<br /><br />Of course, vanilla ice cream isn't really all that memorable, and, I'll admit, there are a few memorable Roberts moments. But despite these fleeting moments (think Thelma and Louise or Steel Magnolias) there is one thing you cannot deny about Ms. Roberts: she is the same in every movie.<br /><br />There are many subtle variations, I'll give her that, but when you boil it down to its essential elements, Julia's performances coast by on a few melancholy looks, a few shy smiles, and a lower lip that juts in the cutest way. If you think about the movies Julia has shined in, they are typically the films with intense plots. But when you stop to imagine her in some of her more shallow films, the parallels are impossible to ignore. Her latest film Erin Brockovitch is such a film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. It's entertaining. But it's formulaic. A cinematic experience made with a cookie-cutter plot. The story: Julia is brash young unwed mother of three Erin Brockovitch who manages to score a job filing forms at a small-time law firm. Erin's take-no-sass attitude and foul-mouthed pluckiness soon take her far, and she ends up with a raise and a new car. This woman with no traditional schooling beyond a few years of high school manages to bring together some 600+ members of a big chemical scandal, memorize all of their families, diseases, phone numbers, and life histories, and does it in this no-nonsense, down-to-earth, sassy way.<br /><br />They win the lawsuit and the big mean corporation has to pay up 300+ million dollars to the working man. Hip hip hooray!<br /><br />I didn't ruin the movie for you. It's not a surprise. This movie floats on the same emotive capacities that all based-on-a-true-story enterprises bank on. Because of that, its basic story is only interesting as something off of which to bounce Erin's personality. Which is entertaining enough, although I don't know if I would call it good theatre.<br /><br />With a storyline with about as much subtlety as a Three Stooges movie, Erin Brockovitch's basic accomplishments fall in the same vein as the Stooges. Just as no one ever watched Curly to see a well-constructed plot, so Erin Brockovitch's exploits become an excuse just to watch her act all tough and in-your-face with everyone.<br /><br />Vanilla isn't the best flavor, that's true, but it's a fail safe. Likewise, I wouldn't recommend Erin Brockovitch to anybody with uncompromising and discriminating tastes; but anyone looking for basic, well-commercialized entertainment and prepackaged humor should come with a spoon and a bib. Erin serves it up piping hot.<br /><br />And she won't take none of your lip, neither.sting as something off of which to bounce Erin's personality.

B000267JQK|4.0|Seether is one of my favorite bands out there, so when I heard that they were re-releasing Disclaimer with 8 &quot;new&quot; songs, I was ecstatic. So I ordered the cd as soon as I had the money, and when I got it I really liked it except for a couple of things.... <br /> The re-done songs are all fantastic, they are so awsome now; except for FXXX It. That song was so awsome on the first album, it was just raw emotion, but on Disclaimer II, Shaun screaming fxxx it in the chorus was faded so that he was shouting it in the backround. It went from a great song full of emotion, to something stupid. <br /> The new tracks aren't really new, they're just the songs they've done for soundtracks and two other songs. These songs are all pretty cool, I've heard some of the other songs before. However, some of these tracks are less than outstanding, &quot;Take me Away&quot; would've been more appropriate closer to the end of the album, and it's also not Shaun's best work. &quot;Out of my Way&quot; didn't really strike a chord in me either; it's a good song, but not my favorite. <br /> The DVD is definately worth the money I paid for this album, I suggest that any Seether fan to buy this cd just for the DVD.

This book WILL jump-start you. It won't give you the gas you need, or show you the road to take, or turn the wheel for you, but it will get your motor running. All that other stuff, it points out, you have to do.<br /><br /> Pressfield is quite concise, and he has a plan for the book, and he fullfills it almost flawlessly and with very little diversion. I say &quot;almost&quot; and &quot;very little&quot; because, at one point, he gets off track.<br /><br /> This is the point where he discusses religion (specifically fundamentalism---and not just of Christianity, but of any ancient doctrine). Religion, he acquiesces, is useful and even somewhat necessary, but it is not the be-all and end-all of any life.<br /><br /> Perhaps his point would've been better suited for his purposes if he'd done a better job of explaining his reasons and excuses, but, ultimately, all he does is advocate his own type of fundamentalism, or rather, his own type of religion. And even then, contrasted with his rather half-hearted condemnation of fundamentalism (in all its forms), his attempts at clarifying his point miss the mark entirely, so that, for an odd and about 15-page moment in the middle of the book, he sounds like an amnesiatic priest who believes strongly in something, but can't quite explain what it is, exactly.<br /><br /> Other than that, the book works, and despite his liberal use of cliched quotes and other people's insights, it may just be the kick-start you need to get your butt off the couch and into the winning side of the war.
B0001W1BXC|1.0|Please note: the 1-star rating I gave to this film is based on the actual DVD product, not the movie itself.  <br />  <br /> Released by Top Ten New Media Production Limited, this DVD is your typical cheapo bargain bin atrocity. Do NOT confuse this with the Anchor Bay release, which I haven't yet watched but is most definitely of better quality. And as I'm writing this review, AB is planning a special edition release to come out in the Fall (along with CHILDREN OF THE CORN).  <br />  <br /> The image quality of this DVD is God-awful; even worse than the VHS or TV prints I've seen. Everything looks foggy, blurry or scratchy, and to make matters even worse, it's PAN and SCANNED. There are 4 chapter stops and no extras. Face it, you KNOW a DVD is of poor quality when it spells &quot;Start Movie&quot; &quot;Strat Movie&quot; on the menu screen. Skip this and wait for the special edition release. <br />  <br /> As for the film itself, it's OK. It's a really uneven film and doesn't feel anything like the original. It's not funny, not scary and, frankly, kind of boring. That said and done, I think it's better to grade each segment seperately.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Old Chief Wood'n Head&quot;  <br /> This is the middling segment of the 3. The first half is really boring, but once the Indian statue starts stalking, it picks up a bit.  <br />  <br /> &quot;The Raft&quot; <br /> Easily the best of the stories. It's quite gory and nasty and is the only tale that comes close to capturing the essence of the EC comic books it's based on.  <br />  <br /> &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot; <br /> Maybe it was because it was late at night but this segment almost put me to sleep. Lois Chiles was fun but it had no meat whatsoever, just her being terrorized over and over again.  <br />  <br /> All in all, skip this trashy release and go for the Anchor Bay DVD. It's a decent movie that I recommend only to those who like B horror flicks from the 80's.
B0002KPIQY|3.0|The movie Gia (based on a true story) is very well made for an HBO film. Jolie is really good and uses her ex-modeling skills a lot in this one. The R rated version cut out a good amount of nudity, so it will be nice to see it all put back in. For those of you wondering, YES Angelina Jolie is naked in a LOT of this film and NO it doesn't have a happy ending!
B000063JZQ|5.0|This was the first issue in what we should call the second age of Polanski . In this case his deep inspiration carried him to play this powerful work of William Shakespeare. Many people consider ths film too violent and bloody , but we are talking about Macbeth , and precisely this violence is part of the story. The visual language needs it, to express the raise and the decay of Macbeth. The greed and ambition feed his soul and will carry him to commit the required murders to reach his goals. This is a machivelian statement .<br />The art direction is eloquent . The cast is first rate , the atmosphere is by far convincing .<br />Polansnki developed one of the most fortunate versions in the screen , but keep in mind the previous releases of Welles and Kurosawa (Throne of blood) , however , this movie is fundamental in your collection.<br />The hands are filled of blood!
B0001O3YD0|5.0|This movie, when it was released, stared nobody famous (helloooo Vin Diesel), was directed by David Twohy (who is responsible for some pretty major flops, like G. I. Jane, The Arrival, Waterworld, Critters 2 and Terminal Velocity), and was written by the brothers Wheat, Jim and Ken, who have also spent most of their time penning some pretty dreary stuff (Birds II, The Fly II, and Nightmare on Elm Street 4). Aside from the fact that Twohy once directed The Fugitive, this movie has nothing going for it right out of the starting block.<br /><br /> Let's talk plot. Taking place in the distant future, a space ship is carrying some passengers to an unnamed planet. Among the denizens is a dangerous convict, who is our narrator. For no explained reason, the ship's hull is punctured full of holes, causing an understandable and intense crash, depositing the surviving members of the group on a large deserted planet that has three suns. Unfortunately, a major solar eclipse is on the verge of occurring, and the planet just happens to be infested with a horrifying race of aliens that can only live in the dark. Needless to say, the aliens begin feasting on the poor survivors like they're Human McNuggets. Pass the popcorn!<br /><br /> Perhaps the most admirable trait of the movie is its patience. It jumps into the story with just enough exposition to keep it sensible, but it doesn't rush anywhere from there, doesn't make any excuses, and doesn't explain itself any more than it has to. Each element of the story (including the nicely designed and unobtrusive sub-plots) achieves a mythical quality within the confines of the well-measured story. Of course, the cinematography helps. The first half of the movie, establishing the mood and situation, is almost over-exposed, glaring a hot white. The three suns (one of which is a silver blue) shine beautifully on the shimmering and humming planet, and everyone's faces become bleached masks. And then, suddenly, it's dark.<br /><br /> There's nothing devouring about the film. It certainly doesn't swallow the audience whole, the way Aliens did. But it does provide a context and a story that, in its own element, is believable and suspenseful, the way Alien did. Sure, Pitch Black has its cheesy moments, but it's the type of cheese you don't regret, and most of it provides a welcome relief from the constant swarthy forms rushing by in the darkness. Balanced out by moments of intense creepiness, the cheese helps keep the movie from falling into total self-importance.<br /><br /> But what makes the flick (despite nicely underplayed acting all around) is the visually enchanting tricks the director opted to add. The convict narrator spent most of his life in a prison with almost no lighting. Upon his release (i.e. breakout) he got a doctor to give him night vision. (C'mon, it's the future) At many points the movie adopts his point of view, which is simultaneously gorgeous and chilling. Add to that the alien point of view (which is an array of crystalline shards, intended to represent the way they &quot;see&quot; things in a manner similar to bats: via echoes), and you have a flick well worth just watching, if not experiencing.<br /><br /> It's hard to know who'll like it and who won't, but I don't hesitate to say this is a good movie. Playing out like a live action version of Myst plus Doom, this show has its weak points and its strong points, its silly moments and its strong moments, but doesn't disappoint. And although some of it may be gross, some of it disturbing, and some of it a little dopey, it's an engaging story without a predictable resolution, tuned to an almost perfect pitch.<br /><br /> Get it? &quot;Pitch?&quot; Pitch Black? Just go see the movie, for crying out loud.There's nothing devouring about the film. It certainly doesn't swallow the audience whole, the way Aliens did.

B00006CXXU|5.0|WOW Christina has one of the most powerful voices out there. Her true love for her music is reflected, and all the tracks on this album are deep and meaningful.
B00003CXCT|3.0|As a lifelong fan of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; Trilogy (I was 5 when &quot;A New Hope&quot; hit theaters in 1977), I am greatly distressed that the original versions of the films will not be present on the upcoming DVD release. For the reviewer who was implying that those of us complaining about the originals not being included might be a bit dense, of course we all KNOW that the VHS video release in 1995 stated it would be the last time they would be released. However, let's be reasonable here. DVD was in the infancy of its' development at that time. Many of us would love the opportunity to have the original versions on this new and improved format that will last a lifetime, unlike VHS. Denying us that because of a statement that may have been made prematurely is simply not fair. And for those who say, &quot;so just burn your original VHS trilogy onto DVD's if you want them so badly&quot;, let's be honest here. That is NOTHING like having an official studio DVD release, and you know it! All of the VHS imperfections and fuzziness will still be present on such homemade discs. Now that I'm accustomed to viewing films on DVD, trying to watch a VHS tape today is a most painful experience, indeed. Aside from the convenience of being able to skip around to different sections of films instantly, the biggest joy of DVD is the unparalleled picture clarity and crispness. A homemade DVD transfer of the VHS original trilogy would be nothing more than a normal VHS version with chapter search that will not deteriorate any further than it already has. That's not exactly what we want, obviously. One could reasonably expect George Lucas to have a bit of compassion and make an exception to the 1995 \\"one last time\\" statement in this case, right? After all, it was his fans (a.k.a. \\"Us\\") supporting his efforts that made him what he is today. What better way to thank us for that than to provide what we want most: The original versions of the \\"Star Wars\\" Trilogy in crystal clear,re-mastered prints on studio DVD's that we can treasure forever? <br />  <br /> For the reviewers who've been knocking the prequels, let me address that for just a bit. Episodes I and II are fine films in their own right, and I'm not here to bash them in the slightest. I enjoyed them at the theater and own both of them on DVD, and will be one of the first ones in line to see Episode III next year. However, step back and let's be honest here. How hard is it to create this incredible universe we all love so much with a bunch of computers? Most of the acting is done around NOTHING, and the backgrounds, ships and enemies/aliens are added later. That is a far cry from the originals, folks. Every ship or vehicle you saw, every explosion, every alien and droid, every single THING that wowed you in the theater was an actual model, prop, actor in costume or puppet being filmed. Talk about a labor of love! Despite the limitations imposed by the time period of their creation, the originals are much more impressive to me than the prequels. I don't mind the &quot;special edition&quot; enhancements to the original films, and I don't lose any sleep over them as it sounds like some reviewers do. I just would have greatly enjoyed the OPTION of still being able to view the original versions on DVD too. I know from what I've read here that MANY fellow fans agree with me on that. <br />  <br /> George Lucas may feel like his original trilogy is an &quot;inferior, unfinished product&quot; that is not worthy to be seen anymore, but he is imposing his personal feelings on all of his fans who feel differently. I'm sure we all agree that he has absolutely NOTHING to be ashamed of with his original films. So what if they don't look as good as what can be produced today, and have a few visible imperfections? We don't mind that! I'm telling you, if some of those &quot;problems&quot; hadn't been pointed out to me by George Lucas himself in his VHS interviews, I would NEVER have noticed them. Mr. Lucas's original films are works of art that showcased special effects no one had ever accomplished before, and they looked pretty darn good to me. If you're reading this Mr. Lucas, I'm asking you nicely: PLEASE consider changing your mind about releasing the original versions on DVD! SO many of your loyal fans want this! <br />  <br /> Moving on, let's talk a bit about the &quot;Special Editions Only&quot; DVD box set that WILL be released next month. It has a nice lineup of commentaries for each film and there is a bonus disc containing a wealth of behind the scenes materials. Both of those features will be very nice touches and are too good to miss. However, the one thing I REALLY wanted (aside from the original versions of course) was a deleted scenes section. It could have included the &quot;Anchorhead&quot; scenes from &quot;A New Hope&quot;, the additional \\"Wampa\\" scenes in the rebel base from \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and the &quot;Sandstorm&quot; scene from &quot;Return of the Jedi.&quot; I've seen still shots from these scenes and have read their dialogue, but it would be so much nicer to actually get to SEE and HEAR them. No dice, though.  <br />  <br /> In summary, I give the DVD box set three stars. That is not because of problems with the material that IS included, but because of the content that IS NOT included that I feel should have been. Despite that, I have no intention of boycotting this DVD release. The special edition versions of the original trilogy on DVD will definitely be worth owning, especially at such a reasonable price level. Don't boycott the set just for what's missing. Remember, George Lucas doesn't need our money at this point. He already has all that he will ever need. Maybe instead of bad-mouthing him and claiming you're going to &quot;hurt him in his wallet&quot;, you should try the simple approach of politely appealing to him to provide you with what you want? If you refuse to buy this box set simply to try to &quot;punish&quot; him, in reality you're only punishing yourself. <br />  <br /> Ok, I'm coming down off the soapbox now. Next! :)
B00003CXD5|5.0|John Huston made - in my personal opinion - his masterpiece with this movie . Inspired in the most shakesperian mood , Huston tells us the story of men in search of gold and the raise of the unknown dragons who live in the deepest of his soul . The greed  that primary instinct - loads the screen .<br /><br />Bogart in his most difficult role , won the challenge . The picture is the best shakesperian western ever made. All the prizes for Huston were widely deserved for this cinema jewel.
6305903182|4.0|Scream 3 is a good film. Not great, but good.<br /><br /> It certainly has a lot to live up to. The original Scream, when it was first released, was a refreshing departure from the belabored and formulaic cesspool to which horror movies had long since relegated themselves. Mixing an array of tongue-in-cheek self-referential in-jokes with legitimate terror, the first installment of this multi-million dollar franchise revived a genre that had long since been condemned to movie history, buried alive by such cinematic c**p as Critters 3 and Leprechaun 4: In Space. Never heard of those? Not surprised.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, the sequel, and even the third installment to some extent, threatened to collapse in upon itself. Part of the charm of Scream was the way it mixed a clever hook (a horror movie that knows it's a horror movie) with some very simple, but plausibly disturbing murders and motives (or lack thereof). Cashing in on the success of its predecessor, the makers of Scream 2 hastily jammed together a conglomeration of dying college students with some shaky logic, resulting in mediocre fare. Although it has some great scenes (with the intro being one of the best and most ironic murder scenes out of all three installments), the second of the series seemed a bit too blood-happy. &quot;See here?&quot; the makers seemed to be saying. &quot;We're doing it again! Isn't it great?&quot; And we smiled and said, &quot;Sorta.&quot;<br /><br /> Well, Scream 3 is a winner. In fact, the worst that can be said for the flick is that its irony is often a bit forced, and it occasionally succumbs to the very cliches that it seems to mock. Although it doesn't reach the crystal clear tones of the original, it takes the same old cast to some impressive heights. The film is set on the set of Stab 3, a movie within the movie that is a fictional fictionalization of the actual murders in Screams 1 and 2, which are fictional to us, but not to the fictional makers of the Stab movies. Following me? Therefore, there are pretty much two of every cast member. Courtney Cox, for example, plays Gale Weathers, while Parker Posey plays an actress playing Gale Weathers. It's pretty cute.<br /><br /> This gives the cast some artistic license, which adds to the humor and the tension of the script. With the performances by Posey and David Arquette (as the somewhat annoying Deputy Riley) by far the best of the cast, Scream 3 boasts not only some believable fear, but it also has plot twists that aren't ludicrous for once. Written by Ehren Kruger (the man responsible for the fabulous film Arlington Road), this final bow by the Scream movies is done gracefully and, thank God, unpredictably.<br /><br /> Of course, there are some hitches. The killer, for instance, takes two ice picks to the neck, one to the chest, a nicely carved and varnished Victorian table to the skull, and several vases to face, and he/she still comes off with barely a bruise. Ah, but do we care? Not that much, really. Although some of the movie trips a bit over moments of unnecessary complexity and melodrama, those moments are few and fleeting. And although it can be said that the movie itself is not quite as substantial as the first, it is certainly a fitting and satisfying close to a franchise that never took itself too seriously to begin with.ies.

B000001FI7|5.0|Before I listened to &quot;Dummy&quot; I'd never listened to any form of trip hop before. I was pretty close minded to the idea but a friend insisted. I was amazed at who beautiful this album turned out to be. The vocals were chilling and the beats were down tempo and hypnotic. The lyrics ached with isolation and longing and were sung with raw emotion. To this day &quot;Dummy&quot; remains one of my most played albums and has opened a new world of music for me. &quot;Wondering star&quot;, &quot;Sour times&quot; and &quot;roads&quot; are amazing tracks.
B00005JN2F|4.0|Sequels generally tend to be a bit of a let down, but not The Bourne Supremacy. Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne, and this time around, Bourne is really angry. The CIA is after Bourne again, this time thinking that he has killed two operatives in Berlin. Bourne was actually 4,000 miles away in India at the time and living with his girlfriend Marie. <br /> <br />There are lots of chase and fight scenes, all choreographed perfectly, though the camera was incredibly jolted throughout and too many closeups make it confusing during hand to hand fight scenes. I overheard several theater-goers complaining of motion sickness afterward. It didn't bother me, I liked it-- it only added to the overall tone of the film, which is one of chaos, confusion, and lots of running. <br /> <br />Great perfomances by Matt Damon, Joan Allen, and Julia Stiles (who truly looked absolutely terrified when Bourne put a gun to her head). This is definitely a thrill ride, one that's fantastic to see on the big screen, unless you get queezy easily. It's not really too important to see the first film either before you see this one. It would no doubt help you get to know the character better though.  <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|It's really sad that Lucas has destroyed such a great piece of film magic.  I will not buy this DVD box set and if you ever want to see the original trilogy released on DVD I suggest you don't buy it either.
B00004RF97|1.0|First let me say this: I AM NOT A KATHARINE HEPBURN FAN. I find her mannerisms, rapid fire speech, twittering high pitched voice and her hyperactive personality too much for me! She gets on my nerves and the best scene in this movie is when Cary Grant pushes her through the door and she falls flat. I only wish when she had fallen she wouldn't have gotten back up and the film would have ended right there. For this reason I have never been able to sit through an entire showing of this film, despite the star power of Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart who make up for what is lacking in its leading lady...(Just my opinion). I know I'm in the minority here and we all have different tastes, so please, no offense to Hepburn admirers. I actually have two movies of hers that I love her in...(Stage Door (1937) and Dragon Seed (1944). Its because in those films she toned down her mannerisms and wasn't unlikeable. Perhaps its just the hyperactivity that gets to me, I don't know. I can't give this film an honest critique because I've never been able to sit through an entire showing of it. I either fall asleep or get too much of Hepburn (who in my opinion was severely overrated as an actress....of all the golden era actresses, needless to say she is my least favorite....). So this review of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; may be unfair and biased. One thing is certain....the Oscar that Jimmy Stewart won for this was given to him because the Academy overlooked him the year before in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;. His role is truly secondary to Hepburn's and Grant's. The Oscar that year by Stewart's own admission should have gone to Henry Fonda for &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. As I said, I'm in the minority here but we all have different tastes. If you're like me and don't like Hepburn, then stay away from this one.
0553296981|5.0|This book is hallmark of human behavior under death threatening circumstances. A slow transformation of child into a young woman with all the feeling & constant grasp and daily account of the outside gruesome surroundings. The writting is so mature and the feelings in the days of captivity are well penned. A harsh reality faced by Jews during WW-II seems like a fiction out of some cruel writeup by an endowed author.<br /><br />A must read and preserve for life time book for the whole mankind.
B00023BLXK|4.0|I didn't think I would like this one better than the original. The original is a classic-- the perfect 80s movie, but the new one is so much more sensual and emotional. My only complaint is that it ended much too quickly, without much closure for the audience, but otherwise this film is a joy to watch. <br />  <br /> Katie (Romola Garai) has just moved to pre-revolution Cuba. She's a total bookworm, but when she meets hotel waiter Javier (the marvelous Diego Luna) she's completely swept away. The basic story follows that of the original-- she doesn't know how to &quot;feel&quot; the music, her parents dissaprove of the guy she likes, preferring her to date the guy she hates.  <br />  <br /> The cinematography is impressive, and the colors are amazing-- lots of reds and oranges. It's so picturesque. The performances were great, the dancing was wonderful (although I don't think the dancing was necessarily dirty, it was much more beautiful and sensual than the dancing in the original). I really like that Patrick Swayze makes an appearance as a dance instructor. His limited screen time is awesome.  <br />  <br /> Definitely check this one out. If your a fan of the original, don't snub this one, you may like it better. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B00000IPAX|5.0|A lot of people will tell you that this is the point when blink-182 became sell-outs. Just because this is when they made it big doesnt mean they are sell-outs. It makes me so mad when ignorent people tell you that just because a band is on trl or the radio they are sell-outs. This is a great punk, yes punk cd. It has lyrics that every teen or older can relate to, and its funny. Go buy it, no blink fan should be without.

0375758992|5.0|My heart and mind are still wrapped up in this book. Usually, upon finishing one book, I immediately jump into another one, but I can't quite seem to do that with this book. This book is so full of life, it's hard to put down. Alexandra writes about her childhood in Africa so well...It's right out there, she doesn't mince words and she tells it exactly like it is. We see everything through Alexandra's eyes. We experience poverty in Africa, racism in Africa, life in Africa. That is exactly what this book is...an experience and one that is not to be missed!
B00004WKII|5.0|This box set should be the one to get even if you don't like Hendrix because the reason you do not like him is you've probably only heard a handful of his most well-known recordings. I, as a huge fan, am even tired of hearing the Jimi Hendrix &quot;radio songs&quot; that are extremely overplayed on all the classic rock stations. Actually, I suggest getting this rather than any of the studio albums because many of the tracks are un-released, raw, and just amazing. There are a few tracks that were recorded live, some as sound check jams, and some unreleased studio stuff. I love the jam session songs because it shows just how talented Jimi was by showing his ability to improvise without any structured framework around the music. <br /> An excellent set and put together extremely well.
B000009EUM|5.0|I remember my sister back in october 1986 bought this album. She was very excited about it, but then soon figured that the album was very different from the 1985 release &quot;Hunting high and low&quot;. I however loved it and I remember listening to &quot;I've been losing you&quot; over and over again. I regard the first side A, the first five songs, as the best start of a record ever, and believe me, I own quite a few records. The second side B is weaker, especially Cry Wolf, which I never have liked, and Maybe maybe. Apart from that the songs are awesome. Listening to this album today makes me realize how mature a-ha had grown in a matter of 1 year. I believe if the album had been recorded today the somewhat electro-simple sounds of the keyboards and guitars would have been replaced by more organic sounding stuff which would further improve on the already awesome result. Apart from that the record is a must for anyone wanting a deeper better understanding into a-ha than the Take on me fans. I think in a way the record was too good for their own fans, since there were mostly teenager girls wanting Morten to show his biceps. The true fans stayed though, and has never complained about that... I rank this record as a-ha's best, and on a top three on my overall 300 record collection. As you might understand I suggest you all to buy this album, it is awesome!
0156027321|5.0|...it can easily win you over to the power of storytelling. <br />  <br /> &quot;Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims.&quot; <br />  <br /> So says Pi, the young man at the center of this novel, whose innocent faith and love of life lead him to practice three different religions without feeling that they conflict with each other. His secular parents, who own and operate a zoo populated with wild animals, are a little embarrassed, but Pi is unabashed: \\"I just want to love God.\\"  <br />  <br /> His story really begins in a shipwreck, after he finds himself in a lifeboat in the company of a few zoo animals. He survives 227 days, most of them in the company of a hungry, 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger. (A premise famously borrowed from another novel, but used for a wholly original story and work.) It is a story Pi claims will make one believe in God. It might, but when forced to give an alternative version of the events following the sinking of the ship and the loss of his parents, his story is put into a poignant new light suggesting that God, or the miracle of life itself, is an act of perception.  <br />  <br /> It is an absorbing, some might say addictive novel. It never drags - it grabs and does not let go, by turns playful and harrowing. This novel deserved its Booker prize and earns your attention. Highly recommended. <br />

B00020X88O|4.0|Okay, I just finished watching the complete Showgirls VIP Limited Edition special features and I am a tad confused.  Does David Schmader love Showgirls, hate Showgirls, love to hate Showgirls, or love Showgirls but has to trash it because the guy is embarrased to admit he is a serious fan of the film.  All joking aside, I found some of the commentary amusing but still as useless as the lump removed from Henrietta Bazoo's #@*!

0743455967|5.0|On Writing is a mixture of autobiography and 'how-to-write' book.  It works both ways. I'm not a huge King fan but it was still very interesting and inspiring to here about his early misadventures, especially if you've read some of his short story collections and get the fun of connecting story to real life incident. <br /> <br />As a 'how-to-write' book it was liberating to me. A lot of what King thinks just falls in line with what I feel, or even hope. One of his premises (and out of context it sounds a tad silly but it fits, believe me) is that stories already exist, and as a writer it is your job to carefully unearth them for the world to enjoy. King eschews elaborate outlines and summaries and instead lets the story go where it will. That appeals a lot to me. <br /> <br />There're also some very practical tips and advice; in fact the book is jam-packed full of good stuff. If you're struggling to find your voice, to meet your muse, read this book!
0060989157|4.0|Motley Crue were insane.  I always knew it and after reading this, I was not only convinced they were bonkers but should all recieve help!  On an ongoing basis. <br /> <br />However, The Dirt reads like the best party you weren't invited to.  From Bunnies to black magic, carousing to carnage and back again, the Crue seemed to have lived out every rock cliche in existance and invented a couple of new ones along the way. <br /> <br />The Crue come across as an entertaining bunch of monkeys who seem to be in the music game just for the f**king and sucking that seems to go with the territory.  It's a good thing when it comes to writing though, how dull would it be to just bang on about chords and drum risers for 20 chapters?  For die hard fans the lack of musical insight might be taxing, with Mick Mars being the only one seemingly interested in what happens at the mixing desk, not on it.... <br /> <br />As for the rest, Nikki is the sweetest, but the most dangerously hedonistic person I've ever read about... Tommy is dumb as a bag of spanners and Vince, well, he just got fat!  But his telling of his daughter's death is absolutely wrenching.. <br /> <br />The book is well edited, the photos okay but not quite there as far as portraying the goods as much as the text, but there is not a skeleton left jangling in the closet making it a very satisfying journey from the bginning to beyond. <br /> <br />Any Crue fan should get this, just for the peek behind the scenes of the band they may have just started wearing eyeliner for, and for the rest of the world, there may never be another band like Motley Crue, so get in there and get filthy.
B00004W50T|5.0|\\"The big, pink house,\\" was one thing that everyone in my college dorm could agree upon in 1968, when this masterwork emerged. Farm boys, city boys, hippies, frat-boys all agreed: \\"this is great!\\" Eric Clapton agreed, too. Once he heard it, he decided to leave his supergroup and follow the new path of Dylan and the Band.      All that aside, this recording continues to astonish me with its tastefulness here some 36 years into its future. If you drop the needle (or, point the laser) to track one, \\"Tears of Rage\\", I think you'll get what I mean. It's pacing is glacial, its tone mournful and its effect on the listener is positively spell-binding. It is still almost shocking. There is actually no other song to which I would compare it. This is the charm of \\"Music From Big Pink\\". All of the original tracks have just that kind of effect. Is that a trombone on \\"Tears of Rage\\"?       Let's consider some of the other inimitable performances herein: \\"Chest Fever\\", with its Bach organ prelude and stately though powerful rhythm unravels itself and begins to swing with stoic, contained passion. The organ-work is stunning and the performance, like many here is one of a kind. \\"Long, Black Veil\\" is possibly an ancient song and the ties to the past are reinforced in this recitation. The fog of regret and sorrow conjured by the Band on this old chestnut is palpable. Then, of course, there is what is arguably the Band's most famous song, the whimsically mysterious \\"The Weight\\". The other tunes here included will similarly impress upon you their singularity.       And despite the stand-out, unusual songs, the album works as a whole, musically and every other way. Something about the overall sound of the disc lingers with you as much as the songs themselves.       Perhaps inconsequentially, it is noted that this album grew out of the rootsy explorations by Bob Dylan and the Band now known collectively as \\"The Basement Tapes\\". However, listening to the remaining shards of those sessions does very little to prepare you for the full, main course presented here. They didn't know what to call it, they didn't know what to call the band playing it, so they just called it \\"Music\\" from \\"Big Pink\\" the home in Woodstock NY to the Basement Tapes Sessions. The aggregate musicians they merely called \\"the band\\". Music played by the band.       By the way, (in my opinion) the Band never did anything again that quite lived up to this and neither did Dylan - this is magic, a one-shot deal. Organic music grown from months of playing songs. (As Band-Member Robbie Robertson told Eric Clapton when he showed up at Big Pink, \\"We don't jam.\\")      So anyway, there's more here than meets the ear, but what meets the ear is way way way more than you might expect.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|How much was I hedging that Macaulay Culkin was going to be rubbish!  A lot.  And was he?  Not really.  Damn. <br /> <br />Screamers, dreamers, you name it, they inhabited the neon world of New York and its sweatbox clubs.  Was it all dancing cheek to cheek and overpriced cocktails? No way, baby!  It was sex! Drugs! Death! Panstick!  And James St James and Michael Alig were up there with the best. <br /> <br />Party Monster is the 'no holds barred' look at how the Club Kids came and went.  With plenty of limp wrists, crack pipes and affected pretty boys going 'ooooh, Michael, that's my look', it could easily grate on someone whose idea of a top film is Rambo.  But for those that were there, the curious and the Disco Bloodbath readers, there's plenty to get into. <br /> <br />Seth Green is cracking.  He maybe the size of a gherkin, but he does vacuous party boy like he was born to it.  Macaulay looks awkward at times (you would too in hotpants!), but his acting is decent and there's not a face-clapping shriek in sight.  Marilyn Manson is hilarious, but that could be down to a non-speaking role.  The costumes are eye popping, the music suitably catchy and the frisson between Mac's Alig and Wilmer-whatshisface from That 70s Show is quite touching. <br /> <br />The film is disposable, definitely. The characters are generally not ones you really care about, though Green's St James is certainly endearing in a bitchy way. But it's candy coloured good fun and the murder seems to be just a hook to hang one and half hours of partying on.  Nevertheless, it's a great film for a Saturday night.  Not high concept, but definitely 'popcorn indie'!
B00001PE4D|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The plot is amazing, the characters are deep and well developed, and the flow is excellent. <br /> Selma Blair as Cecile. A naiive, sweet, and virginal girl who just wants someone to look up to. More specifically, Kathryn. She just does what she is told and is sweet for that reason. The fact that she is so very naiive makes her funny as well. The scene at Mrs. Rosemont's with Kathryn is absolutely perfect.  <br /> Reese Witherspoon as Annette. Annette is virtuous and chaste, but firm in her beliefs. She gets wind of Sebastian and tries to make herself stay away from him. Not an easy task. A self-professed virgin till marriage, Annette doesn't trust herself with Sebastian (and rightly so). By the end, she is a strong woman, not the little girl who wrote a &quot;manifesto&quot; for Seventeen. <br /> Ryan Phillippe as Sebastian Valmont. Sebastian is coniving, decietful, and charming; every girls dream and worst nightmare. He makes a point of destroying girls and thier reputations. He refers to them as &quot;insipid Manhattan debutantes.&quot; He decides his next conquest will be his greatest, and is determined to win a bet conceived with Kathryn. He is determined not to get emotional, which is usually his strong point. But something about Annette gets to him, and he can't get past it. In the end he, like Annette, has changed.  <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar as Kathyn Merteiul. This may be the finest example of perfect casting. Although being a huge fan of hers may make me biased, anyone can see she plays the part perfectly. Like Sebastian, Kathryn is coniving and decietful; but unlike Sebastian, she doesn't change. She enjoys making trouble while mantaining a facade of being &quot;a lady.&quot; Student Body President at Manchester, she must set an example for all those who look up to her. Including Cecile. She befriends Cecile in order to get back at an ex-boyfriend, and ends up making quite the mess of Cecile's life. Though she is evil in a sense, Kathryn is also quite misunderstood. She explains it all in a wonderfully written and spoken speech that is both honest and eloquent.  <br /> The plot of this movie is sharp and inventive. Yes, it is based on another movie, which was based on a book, but the twist of making all the characters high school students was absolutely brilliant. <br /> With some...uh, interesting scenes, and Ryan Phillippe nudity to boot, this movie is the best one I have seen in a long time. One of few movies that I can watch over and over again and not get sick of. An absolute gem.
B00007KWHN|5.0|The second greatest rock album of all time IMO. Only one song gets skipped on my CD player (&quot;Venture&quot;). The other five songs are Yes (and ProgRock) classics. &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; is one of my five favorite Yes tunes, &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot; and &quot;All Good People&quot; are also 10's, and &quot;Perpetual Change&quot; is an underrated great tune. Steve Howe's &quot;The Clap&quot; is catchy and upbeat. The first of the &quot;Spectacular Six&quot; Yes albums of the 70's (along with &quot;Fragile&quot;, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, &quot;Relayer&quot;, &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; and &quot;Going for the One&quot;).
B000001F76|4.0|...although i really dig it if i'm in the right mood. quality country music started here, which means quality alt.country--one of my favorite genres--started here, too. all the classics--&quot;move it on over,&quot; &quot;so lonesome i could cry,&quot; &quot;i can't help it (if i'm still in love with you),&quot; &quot;hey, good lookin',&quot; &quot;honky tonk blues,&quot; &quot;ramblin' man,&quot;--are here, and the list goes on and on. pretty essential for country music fans.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Relayer is a fabulous album. Rick Wakeman was replaced on keyboards by Patrick Moraz, but the band didn't miss a beat IMO. I rank this album as the 3rd best in the Yes catalog (behind &quot;The Yes Album&quot; and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, and just ahead of &quot;Going for the One&quot;). &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; is another classic 20+ minute Yes piece, and &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; rocks heavy (some GREAT guitar work by Steve Howe on this tune). But, the song which elevates this CD ever so slightly above the aforementioned &quot;Going for the One&quot; is the final song, &quot;To be Over&quot;. This 9+ minute gem is the one of the most underrated great Yes songs. The artwork by Roger Dean is incredible. You will be pleasantly surprised by this CD.
B000066HI4|5.0|one of the best albums....................ever. any genre, any era. my god, what a knock out. this is the latest musical persona of will oldham (whose illustrious career began as &quot;palace/palace music/palace brothers&quot;) and many say it's his greatest achievement yet. i knew within ten seconds of first hearing this record that it had to be true. every song reaches in and squeezes the heart, gets all tangled up in your insides. you know what's great about this record? every single haunting track is memorable and affecting. every one. there isn't a single track that fades into the background...and that is a rare treat these days. and the fact that a tune as staggeringly vibrant as &quot;a minor place&quot; can co-exist so easily with smothering odes like &quot;i see a darkness&quot; is just amazing. it is, in many ways, like life.
B000002Q7Y|5.0|I like almost all the tracks on this recording. Steve Morse is simply amazing. I like Steve Morse in this group setting more than with Deep Purple unfortunately. Power is like the Steve Morse Band meets Kansas. I High Recommend this CD for any Steve Morse, Kansas, or Prog Rock fan. Enjoy! <br />
B00000AFWZ|5.0|this 4-disc box set from rhino covers insurgent rock music from the 60s, just as _wild, fast, and out of control_ covers the rebellious 50s and _no thanks!_ covers the nascent punk movement of the 70s...and if that latter set served to persuade me that the world of 70s rock 'n' roll wasn't such a black hole of worth, this one serves only to justify the widespread claims that popular music reached its zenith in the 60s, a time of passionate experimentalism and open-minded acceptance the likes of which had never been seen, and will never be seen again. it's true, when all is said and done, roughly half of the songs included here fade from memory and into the background. but guess what? that still leaves about 60 standout tracks, and even the ones that eventually fade away are never less than immediate and engaging while they're playing. all of which makes this set an essential and rewarding listen, not to mention energizing. the songs here, many of which were commercially handicapped by primitive production methods, are easily as poignant and heartfelt as those on the punk set, but while the vast majority of the songs on no thanks! were almost entirely distinct and original, the majority of these songs have clearly defined antecedents and influences. for this reason, i think i prefer _no thanks!_, but this set is a fantastic complement. there are too many individual stunners here to name, but almost all of them are from bands i'd never even heard of before the purchase. which leads me to the single-most amazing aspect of nuggets: there are huge hits, here: &quot;wooly bully,&quot; &quot;incense and peppermints,&quot; &quot;time won't let me,&quot; &quot;little bit o'soul,&quot; &quot;double shot (of my baby's love),&quot; &quot;i want candy,&quot; and most recognizably, &quot;louie louie.&quot; the amazing thing is not that these songs are included on a set alongside virtual unknowns, but that these songs were hits in the first place. why? they are no different--no better--than any other song included. the amazing thing is that these songs were accepted so graciously, so eagerly by the listening public...that young people had such influence and power...and GOOD TASTE!! they were able to hear something in this music that the kids of today have been dumbed down too severely to hear. for chrissakes, &quot;louie louie,&quot; an international smash hit that sold literally millions of copies worldwide, had a pretty glaringly obvious mistake in it. during the bridge, as the guitar solo is rocking around the neighborhood, the vocalist goes off his rocker and starts singing a full measure ahead of where he's supposed to. he immediately figures out he's flubbed, and cuts off, leaving the drummer to pick up the slack with an awkward fill...and yet, that just makes the song more beautiful, more pure, somehow. and the kids loved it, nurtured it, and that's why this set is here today. people cared, and they knew the score, and if they were listening to the radio and thought &quot;bah! i could play that!&quot; they went down to their garage, called over their friends, and learned how to play instruments. or not. maybe they just screwed around with chords and verses and accidentally came up with something profound. this set brings those moments into the spotlight...it is musical justice.
B00008PX8P|5.0|DVD format is a wonderful way to view movies and TV programs, but the new perspective it brings to the music industry is in a class of its own. Gone are the days of 'jumpy' footage of classic bands, with blurred and muffled sound quality. Now it is possible to IMAGINE YOU WERE THERE. The Led Zeppelin boxed DVD set is one such experience. <br /> As someone who was not even alive at the time (b. 1985), and grew to enjoy the music by trying my fathers Cds out for a laugh, this DVD is priceless. <br /> As soon as you view disc one, crisp, clear black and white footage of Jimmy Page meets you, playing with a violin bow to a packed out aircraft hangar in a bygone world, creating sonic shards of sound that are captured perfectly in the Dolby surround format.  <br /> What follows are 5 hours of concert footage of quality rock that surely can never be repeated or surpassed by any other band. <br /> Disc 1: <br /> The Royal Albert Hall: Led Zep look young and healthy here, and the music has the same vitality. Such is the quality of the individual skills of each band member that I mistakenly thought this was footage from a later stage in Led Zep's carrer. In fact the band have only been together for a year or so, already with hits 'Whole Lotta love and 'Communication Breakdown'. John Bonham shines with his incredible, pounding, relentless solo work on his song 'Moby Dick'. <br /> The extra footage on this Cd is interesting, more so I suspect to those who were around at the time. <br /> Disc 2: <br /> The better of the two Cds. <br /> &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;: Edited to resemble a music video more than a documentary, the long atmospheric ride atop a car into the sun-kissed stadium is likely to evoke strong memories of summer in the 70's. The roar of the crowd and the scintillating opening riff was the highlight of the CD for me, and the song pulsates with energy. <br /> Madison Square Garden: Footage from the same concert as &quot;The Song remains the Same&quot;, which almostput me off Led Zep forever because of the shocking treatment of the songs by Plant, who seems to be completely lost. The rest of the band carry it through,with page shining in particular towards the end of &quot;The Ocean&quot;. <br /> Earls Court: An extremely interesting journey. Jimmy Page could play sublime acoustic guitar, and his treatment of these songs is peerless. Watch for John Paul Jones showing what a complete musician he was, playing Mandolin, Bass and synths equally well. <br /> Knebworth: The final concert led Zep ever gave, and a reminder of how well they stood up after a decade on top. Plant is in fine fettle, JPJ is as solid as a rock, Bonzo is very much alive and well, particularly on &quot;Kashmir&quot;; his death just one year later creates a poignancy to his entire display. <br /> Extra footage includes several interviews, and promos. It struck me how softly spoken they all were for such a loud band! <br />  <br /> Overall, a wonderful DVD. perhaps the only fault I found was that many good songs are notably missing, with several lesser songs being covered more than once. I guess this is due to the lack of footage available to work with, and shows just what an extstensive catalogue they have. <br />  <br /> Buy this, whether you like Led Zeppelin or not. This is music.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|fact is, if they rereleased the original _blue album_ as is, with no remastering or bonus tracks, it'd still get a perfect score from me (not that it wouldn't be a little annoying). but instead, it's the _blue album_ remastered (the drums and vocals sound great!) and repackaged with a slew of new artwork and a second disc of rarities, demos, and b-sides from that period, including the infamously magnificent, heavily bootlegged and downloaded triumverate: &quot;suzanne,&quot; &quot;jamie,&quot; and &quot;mykel and carli&quot;. and on top of that, some acoustic renditions, some live tracks, and the early demos. great package.
B00000F6LQ|2.0|Nothing to say about the film itself - simply a word of warning about the box set: it appears from the product listing to be simply a copy of the ordinary 2 DVD edition - which retails for less than half the price of this boxed set - with a copy of the screenplay and some cards and senitypes (whatever they are) thrown in.<br /><br /> The complete screenplay can be obtained from literally hundreds of places on the net - just try googling on &quot;anarcho-syndicalist commune&quot; and you'll see.<br /><br /> You do the maths. Twenty bucks for some cards?<br /><br /> Someone's having a laugh, and my guess is he's not part of a self-perpetuating autonomous collective.<br /><br /> Olly Buxton
B00000JNJ1|5.0|very impressive stuff! i bought this because i've always loved rod stewart's voice but been more or less indifferent to his music (aside from &quot;maggie may&quot; that is; never could resist that one). this is rod's first musical endeavor, a sloppy-as-hell, balls-to-the-wall, hotel-trashin' RAWK band. the guitarist ronnie wood would go on to replace what's-his-face in the rolling stones, and the other one, ronnie lane, wrote some of the best tunes, namely &quot;ooh la la,&quot; which you movie buffs will recognize as the song that so perfectly and triumphantly closes out the film _rushmore_. silkworm covered it on _lifestyle_ and that was the first version i heard: i thought it was a silkworm original until i saw the movie, but i never knew it was a faces track (not even when i ordered it). not to mention &quot;glad and sorry,&quot; which was my favorite song on golden smog's first album (golden smog was something of an alt.country supergroup featuring jeff tweedy and that guy from soul asylum). again, i thought it was a golden smog-penned tune, but turns out it was a faces song. wow. great stuff, here. i knew you had it in you, rod. <br />  <br /> since listening to this, i've gone back and rediscovered some of the early rod stewart albums like _gasoline alley_, _never a dull moment_, and _every picture tells a story_. it's all really great stuff!
B00000G3Q4|5.0|&quot;Evil Dead&quot; is where it all started.       A young Bruce Campbell plays a twenty something college student that vacations at a lonely cabin in the mountains with a group of friends who stumble upon an ancient evil that disrupt their lives forevermore. There really isn't much more that I can say concerning the storyline that hasn't already been said already in reviews here other than that its fairly simple, formulaic, and you have seen similar plots in nearly every slasher movie made. However, unlike many other low-budget slasher flicks, &quot;Evil Dead&quot; has a uniqueness of its own with its queer humor, disorienting camera angles, special effects and gore.   The only thing that was disappointing about this movie is that Campbell's character hadn't yet developed his caustic sarcasm and arrogance that is experienced in the other &quot;Evil Dead&quot; movies. There is no mention of the trademark &quot;groovy&quot; or &quot;come get some.&quot; Also, the comical dark humor found in the other movies are missing here although there is a deliberate amount of cheesiness.   Overall, no horror movie collection is complete without this low-budget classic horror flick.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Just buy the DVD.  Don't even hesitate - it's well worth the money.  This is by far one of the best DVD concerts out there that you can buy.  I love this concert and I watch it at least once a month.  It does not get any better than this.  I also bought the CD and listen to it everyday at work.  Awesome!!!
B0000640SA|5.0|What has not been commented on too much is the subtle humour present in this film noir.  There is something subtly funny about the lengths Leonard will go to seek revenge for his wife's death,as he attempts to rationally cope with his disability, including Polaroid photos, notes to himself, maps, and body tattoos; not to mention stealing a dead man's Jaguar.  Of course to him it is not at all funny, but a thoroughly rational and disciplined response to a debilitating psychological condition. By this constant discipline he hopes to overcome his disability.  I thought this film was strong in almost all ways, including its portrayal of L.A. lowlife,a brutal drug-related murder, the character Teddy, and the use of Sammy Jankis as another example of a person with short-term memory loss. Sammy was a sad case, being denied insurance benefits after an accident; the insurance company--more specifically Leonard-- determined his condition was psychological, not physical.Leonard constantly forces himself to remember Sammy. I thought the scenes with Natalie, who helps him try to find his wife's murderer after Leonard beats up Dodd, were excellent. Whether Leonard or Dodd actually beats up Natalie is unclear. Leonard's memory  is so faulty it's hard to tell. All Leonard knows is he loved his wife, and he has mementos of their life to prove it.  He even has a call girl come in to recreate their former life.  After two viewings I still find it somewhat surrealistic as to what actually happened, even including whether his wife is truly dead or not, or whether in fact Teddy is honest. I think the bulk of the evidence suggests that he is.  There is a short scene late in the film showing his wife embracing his tattooed body, indicating she was alive after he believes she died. The film is very good at evoking for the audience a state of mind of short-term memory loss. There is also some question about the underlying assumptions of the film including the assumption that Sammy's wife wasdiabetic: Teddy says late in the film that Sammy didn't have a wife; it was Leonard's wife who was diabetic.
0517194112|5.0|You should buy this book because it will be the only book by a politician you will ever read that is: <br /> <br />1) Well Written and insightful <br />2) Actually written by the candidate.  <br /> <br />this is a great book, written before Obama was anything on the political landscape. It is honest - sometimes to his own political detrement. It deals honestly with issues of race in america. I encourage everyone who cares about their country to read this book.
B00005ATQD|5.0|This film is an opulent and decadent visual extravaganza, and the story in its most basic form is not surrealistic, but fairly basic and concerns marital fidelity. But because of numerous dreamlike and fantasylike scenes the movie ends up being surreal.  We see both characters straying outside the bonds of marital fidelity, Alice mostly in her elaborate dreams and fantasies though there is a temptation in the ball at the film's beginning which Alice does not succumb to; Dr.Bill in his wanderings about New York City on the several nights following the ball, during which he encounters hookers and patients, among others, who are highly receptive to his advances. The owner of the costume shop also has a young teenage daughter whom, if I am not mistaken,he offers to Dr. Bill. There are numerous direct references to the use of drugs (Dr. Bill and Alice smoke pot), one of the hookers turns out to be HIV-positive, and one of the participants at the orgy dies later that night of a drug overdose.   The most celebrated scene is the masked ball or orgy which forms the heart of the film, at which numerous prominent (?) people gather to indulge their sexual fantasies.  Dr. Bill is an unwelcome outsider but gains admittance through his long-term friendship with the piano player who performs blindfolded at the orgy. This is a secret society and the piano player is removed from New York to Seattle with the assistance of two thugs because he has seen too much, and Dr Bill  is also threatened.     All of these scenes occur after Dr. Bill and Alice have a heated discussion about marital fidelity following the Christmas ball.  Dr. Bill states rather cavalierly that all of his relationships with his female patients are professional, and Alice replies somewhat maliciously that she cannot believe he never considers having an extramarital affair.  Why, indeed, she herself had an elaborate fantasy about having a one night stand with a naval officer she noticed during a visit to Cape Cod. Thelanguage, though not necessarily the film, is pretty crude throughout and is not suitable for children, unless you are an extremely liberated parent.  The fact that the movie takes place over Christmas enhances its opulence considerably.
B000066F6H|2.0|I wasn't so sure about the Hives to begin with, but I guess this confirmed it. I mean, the singles were pretty good, but I was kind of jumping on the bandwagon. I'd never particularly enjoyed any of these &quot;The&quot; bands. <br />  <br /> So what made me think I'd enjoy this one? <br />  <br /> I don't know, but I was probably possessed that day, wanting to get this album above all others. Howlin' Pelle Almqvist may know how to have a good time, but he's purely annoying, from the beginning. The best songs on the disc are the singles, but wasn't that expected? I was looking for a silver lining on this CD, but then I heard &quot;Find Another Girl.&quot; To tell you the truth, I was instantly turned off. What this album remains as is an artifact of new millennium garage rock. Turns out all of it is just some big trend. None of these guys are here to save rock and roll, all they're here for is to pollute the airwaves. <br />  <br /> Sum 41 got it right in the &quot;Still Waiting&quot; video. And guess what? They aren't here to save rock and roll either. They're here to prevent it from becoming something these &quot;The&quot; bands want it to be. Music from the '60s and '70s have influence, but once the generation gap has made its mark, there's no turning back. <br />  <br /> Oh, well. I wish the Hives the best of luck with the sales of their latest album, Tyrannosaurus Hives.
B00000HXFL|5.0|Of the dozen Chet Baker CDs that I own, &quot;Baby Breeze&quot; stands out as the most poignant, intimate and resonant--deeply romantic but never cocktail lounge saccharine. Overall, it has the depth of feeling and richness of melody lacking in some of Chet's earlier, breezier albums. It is definitely a reflection of a more mature singer, musician and human being. His renditions of &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; and &quot;The Touch of Your Lips&quot; are particularly haunting. I could listen to these two tracks for hours--in my solitude.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This album is such an improvement since her first album, Let Go. The lyrics in this album are much serious and you can relate to them more. The voice of Avril is great in this album, she is a good singer. The piano in the whole album makes the songs better. The best songs in the album are My happy ending, Nobody's home, He wasn't (the song may seem to hilary duff pop, but the lyrics are deep &quot;He never make me feel like I was special/ He isn't really what I'm looking for&quot;), Take me away, Fall to pieces, and Forgotten. There are no fillers here. If you really like Avril, I recommend you buy her acoustic cd at Target, she sounds awseome.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|I went into &quot;Mystic River&quot; fully expecting this film to live up to the critical acclaim and accolades that had been heaped upon it. With Clint Eastwood directing and Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney, and Marcia Gay Harden rounding out a stellar cast, I didn't think much could go wrong. Not true. This is one of the most disappointing cinematic experiences I've ever had. The plot is bland and is not in any way original or creative. In fact, it is derivative and closely resembles Lifetime movie of the week productions as far as story and execution go. It's your regular Whodunit movie, only with a Hollywood cast. I still have no idea what the big deal about this movie is. Yes, the acting is all right--it's hard for these actors to misstep--but in the end the story itself is simply not as engaging and original as critics made it out to be. I would avoid this one.
B0000020C4|5.0|This is easily my favorite of the Les Mis recordings that I have heard (I've not heard the entire Original London Cast, but I've heard enough to know I don't like it as much as this one). <br /> <br />For starters, and certainly a very important point, this recording doesn't have the heavy use of synthesizers that the others have. The music is done with a large orchestra, which makes it sound all the better. <br /> <br />On top of that, the cast is amazing. Colm Wilkinson's odd accent takes some getting used to, but once you do he's great (and on this recording of the concert, you can't see the goofy things he does with his eyebrows like you can on the video :)). <br /> <br />Philip Quast brings an extraordinary amount of depth to Javert's character, and Ruthie Henshall brings across Fantine's anguish like no one else. And, thankfully, this recording was spared Frances Ruffelle's annoyingly pathetic Eponine in favor of Lea Salonga's far superior performance in that role, even if Lea Salonga does here and there over-enunciate a few words. <br /> <br />The only minor complaint I might have about this recording's cast is that I would probably have rather had Anthony Warlow as Enjolras, but Michael Maguire is certainly not bad to listen to. <br /> <br />This recording is not as complete as the Complete Symphonic Recording, but it seems to me it cuts out less than the Original Broadway Cast recording. Regardless, the quality of the material that is here makes this CD very much a worthwhile purchase. If you can only buy one Les Mis recording, this is the one with the highest quality music and cast.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Will Ferrell's performance in &quot;Elf&quot; approached genius for me. The plot is pedestrian, but you can't help but be charmed by Ferrell and his elf antics. The supporting cast also shines. The scene that most stands out for me and still makes me giggle is when Buddy (Ferrell) declares that a department store Santa is most certainly NOT the real Santa (Buddy would know, as he lived with the real Santa at the North Pole for most of his life). I laughed so hard in the theater for this scene, and so did much of the audience.  <br />  <br /> Buy or rent this--you won't be disappointed!
0783240236|4.0|This film greatly changes the way I feel about birds.  Once, I loved their songs, their feathers, and their wings.  Watching them fly gracefully across the sky could raise my spirit and inspire me in my activities.  Until I saw this movie.  The horror of their attacks on humans in the film made me realize that animals can have a dark side if they are mistreated.  Perhaps, this is the diractor's own prediction of what will happen if humans continue to destroy animals' habitat.  Their attacks are both a warning and a revenge. <br />I was so into the movie that it distracted me when the indeterminant ending was presented.  I really wanted to know the real reason behind the attacks.  This is a great film to show a class of students, where each student then writes a sequel explaining what they think would happen next and what the birds' motives are. <br />Watch this film... Make time fly...REALLY!
038551123X|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. The idea is great--very original and funny in a dark, dark way. The book starts off in an interesting way and Dexter is an intriguing character I wanted to get to know. However, the other characters in the book are mere charicatures. None of them act like real human beings. Even Dexter is a bit flat. I never really understood why he did what he did or believed that someone like Dexter could actually be so coherent in conveying his thoughts to the reader. Still, the plot kept me going. I wanted to see where it was going. But the ending of this novel was just awful. It was both obvious and completely unbelievable. I was pretty disappointed in this book because I think the premise is much stronger than the delivery.
B00003CXD0|5.0|I have to admit, I was never really a fan of 80's movies. Very few movies filmed in the 80's have ever appealed to me. So after watching Tootsie, I was glad that I had found one comedy made in the 80's that does not suck. In fact, it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, an unemployed actor who pretends to be a woman in order to get a job on a soap opera, and raise enough money to produce his roomate's new play. Bill Murray plays his roomate, and is very funny in this role, one of the funniest I've seen him in actually. Dabney Coleman plays Ron Carlilie, a character you can't help but hate, because of the way he treats Julie. Jessica Lange as
B0001IN0DA|4.0|I'm not sure if Kurt(my favourite wrestler)got worse from his neck injury(he's still fast)but he used a few moves(except mat based), Against Eddie he used belly to belly suplex and 1 of rope, german suplex. Where's the missle drop kick or moonsault of top turn buckle, waist lock take down or that sick inside out german suplex. Watch the street fight on King Of The Ring 2001 and you'll see what I mean. Anyway the match was the best of the night and I think it's alot better than the overated triple threat match. It started of fantastic with Shawn and Chris Benoit then HHH ruined it. HHH needs to retire because since his quad or something was torn from his leg he got werse I heard(I got into wrestling in mid 2001 so I never sore him wrestle before because he was injured). <br />The Cruserwieght match is underrated, Christian/Jericho was was surprisingly great. <br />

B00004T9UF|5.0|One year after his fateful crashlanding into the mainstream, the original Slim Shady returns with a vengeance...against parents, politicians, pop stars, pop rappers, metal rappers, his ex-wife... you get the point. Eminem's racked up endless beefs, a huge fanbase, and enough platinum plaques to plate his teeth (YEEEEAAAHHHH!!!). In 2000, he cranks his winning formula of controversy up a notch to create an ultimately darker, funnier, and more brilliant album. He gets the party started with a more abrupt PSA, following with \\"Kill You\\", a maniacal message to his mother and all haters, set to a quirky beat courtesy of Dr. Dre. Then \\"Stan\\" takes listeners into the world of an obsessed fan of Em's through some clevely worded letters. Easily a classic, along with the more humorous \\"Who Knew\\", sarcastically addressing critics and parents who scorn his explicit lyrics. \\"The Way I Am\\" also does this, in a certainly more direct way. I could go on about these tracks, so i'll just skip to my favorites. There's \\"B-Please II\\", where the rapper rhymes alongside the Westside's finest (including a nice hook from Nate Dogg); \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" marking Shady's return to the charts, with the addictive hook from Dre; and \\"Kim\\", easily one of the scariest rap songs you'll ever find, with an eerily vivid depiction of Em's ex-wife's \\"murder\\". There's also \\"The Kids\\", available on the edited version, which shows that Shady's been watching a LOT of South Park. Overall, if you need any answer to why so much controversy and hype surrounds Eminem, cop this disc; it delivers on both fronts and then some.
B000006XSD|2.0|When a band or a perfomer consistantly puts out music over a multi-decade career, they are bound to drop a few clunkers every now and again. Jethro Tull had 'Passion Play', KISS had 'Music from the Elder', Van Halen had 'Van Halen 3', and Alice Cooper had 'Lace and Whiskey'. Now don't get me wrong, there are some really good songs here, 'Hot Tonight' is a classic Alice rocker that sounds like it came right off of 'Muscle of Love'. 'Lace and Whiskey' is a cool little song with echoes of Film Noir. 'You and Me' is one of Alice's best ballads. But the rest of the album.........well it's not Cooper's best work for sure. 'Love at your Convenience' is almost unlistenable. Alice's vocals are buried under the disco back up singers that not once can you hear him clearly. 'Ubangi Stomp' is a cover of a rockabilly song that just doesn't fit at all on the album. 'King of the Silver Screen' starts off okay, but the lyrics go from funny to simply bizarre, and your left scratching your head wondering how a guy goes from loving movies in the song to a transvestite who is coming out of the closet?! 'My God' actually has the seeds to be a great song, but the production is so lousy you can't understand 75% of what is being sung. And finally, I get a kick that towards the end of the album Alice features a song titled 'I Never Wrote Those Songs', which is an okay acoustic ballad. I am sure that once he sobered up and heard 'Lace and Whiskey' that those were his thoughts exactly. SO yes, this is a Clunker of an album. Should you buy it? If you are a Cooper fan than I say yes, because you need 'Hot Tonight', 'Road Rats', 'You and Me' & 'Lace and Whiskey' in your collection. If you aren't really a fan and only want Alice's hits, or a more listener friendly CD buy one of his many other great albums first.
6304602901|4.0|A film by Hugh Wilson<br /><br /> Those who are disgusted with the entire &quot;Police Academy&quot; series have to look no further than this first movie to find the root cause of their misery. Grossing 81 million dollars in 1984, &quot;Police Academy&quot; set the template for the future movies. The style of the series was set with this first one, though the next six movies never quite hit the level of quality (such as it is) that this first film did.<br /><br /> The new Mayor has relaxed the standards for new recruits to enter the Police Academy. Now, anyone can sign up, and people who would have never considered joining the police force are now attempting to do just that. Included in this group is Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg). Mahoney cannot seem to stay out of trouble with the law (petty stuff, really, nothing malicious), and he is given the choice to either join the Police Academy or go to jail. He is told that he cannot quit, but can be thrown out (little does he know that part of the deal is that the Academy cannot throw him out, either). Mahoney, the prankster that he is, does his best to get thrown out of the Academy.<br /><br /> Along with Mahoney, the Police Academy has several other zany new recruits, among them is the gun loving Tackleberry (David Graf), the soft voiced Hooks (Marion Ramsey), a man with a talent for imitating nearly any sound effect in Jones (Michael Winslow), and also Karen Thompson (Kim Cattrall) who appears as Mahoney's love interest. Calling the cadets &quot;screwball recruits&quot; would be perfectly appropriate, and Lt Harris (G.W. Bailey), an instructor at the Academy, wants them all out and sets them up to fail.<br /><br /> &quot;Police Academy&quot; has something of a slapstick comedy. It is very lighthearted, and the characters (the good guys, anyway) are very likeable. I don't think I would want these recruits in an Academy near me, but it was always fun watching this movie. And that is what &quot;Police Academy&quot; is all about: fun. It seems like everyone in the movie is having fun making it, and it works. Granted, the movie is not nearly as funny as I originally found it ten years ago when I was 15, but I can still manage smiles of nostalgia while watching &quot;Police Academy&quot;. The characters which the movie focuses on are those, with a couple of exceptions, who will return for sequel after sequel and they are fun characters to get to spend an hour and a half with.<br /><br /> &quot;Police Academy&quot; is the only one in the series to get an &quot;R&quot; rating, which is for female nudity and language. After this one, the series starts to get sanitized, which also seemed to tame the comedy as well. This first film sets up many of the running jokes that continue throughout the series, and perhaps for this reason it is the best of the bunch because it is the most original of the bunch.

B00005JLXE|4.0|I wasn't a Daredevil fan before seeing this and didn't know much about him before I watched the movie. I really enjoyed this film and I recently found myself in the graphic novel section of the bookstore picking up Daredevil reprints. The comics and the bonus material on the DVD filled me in on Daredevil's history and it seems that he's been both a devil-may-care 60's comic character and a more dark hard-boiled character. This film tries to bring both versions to the screen and it works. It's a great intro to the world of Daredevil. Even if you've never heard of Daredevil you should still give this DVD a look.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I can't look at her, let alone listen to her. She's boring, generic and this album proves that she can neither write nor sing. Save your $$$ and check out JLO or Brit's albums. They have great beauty plus talent!!!!

I was realy excited to receive it, not to mention the expectations of a claimed 1 1/2 hours extra footage with never seen before scenes. Wow. What dissapointment!

B00009W0U4|4.0|Gaspar Noe's Irreversible is filmed in the same style as Christopher Nolan's excellent Memento. With the story unfolding in reverse sequence, the audience's first impression of the story doesn't end up being the same once it finishes.<br /><br />Everyone has made it a point to mention the disturbing and hard-to-watch sodomizing that Monica Bellucci's character goes through at the hands of a random, strung-out stranger. This 10-minute sequence is as disturbing as any film sequence I have ever had the chance to watch. There is absolutely no feeling of lust or sexiness this scene brings up. A sense of shock, disgust and pain is more appropriate reaction to seeing the lovely Ms. Bellucci's character go through a very inhumane experience. This scene goes a long way to explaining the film's beginning where a brutal and equally inhumane murder takes place inside a murky, red-lit, underground gay S&M club.<br /><br />As the film continues to move backwards in time and shows the viewer the earlier and happier time of Bellucci's and Vincent Cassel's characters, the earlier scenes of violence take on a more poignant and sad note. In a space of a day many lives are broken and destroyed, and in the end all because of a random night occurrence in an dingy, lit underpass.<br /><br />Gaspar Noe's film is not for everyone and even those daring enough to take a chance to view it will have a hard time sitting through the first half of the film. The film itself takes on a dream-like quality as it begins to unfold. From its nightmarish tone and look to a dreamy last reel. I have heard people call Noe's film as exploitive and misogynistic in its treatment of its main female character. In the end, Noe's choice to shoot the rape scene so realistic and have it linger and linger shows the viewer that evil and ugly things do happen in real life. One either takes it and learn from it or turn away and pretend it never happened.<br /><br />Irreversible is a film that people will either love or hate. This film doesn't straddle the center when it comes to viewers reaction to it. Gaspar Noe's film is not perfect, but overall it provokes the viewer to think on what they've seen and felt as the story unfolded.love or hate.

B00009V7RF|5.0|I've known about BEP for a while but never took them seriously. I heard their single &quot;Where is the love&quot; and liked it. Fergie really got my attention but other than that I liked the singles and nothing more. I once heard a song &quot;Shut up&quot; and wondered who it was by. When I found out it was BEP, I immediately went to iTunes and listened to clips of the whole albums. Less than five minutes later I purchased the album from iTunes. I have an iPod with an FM transmitter that I take everywhere with me. I have not listened to another album in one week. Not many albums can be listened from start to finish but this one is one of those rare ones. Good music is hard to come by these days. I love Fergie and her voice. In the songs &quot;Shut up&quot; and &quot;Fly Away&quot; her voice just puts me in a trance. My main factor in buying an album is the beat, the lyrics come second. Buy this album is you're a clubber and love to dance.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Probably one of the greatest movie series/franchises ever (although Lord of the Rings is catching up to it),The Star Wars Saga has became a pop culture phenomenon for almost thirty years.      Generations of fans are fascenated by what is essentially the story of Anakin Skywalker,A troubled young Jedi who becomes seduced by the dark side of the force and becomes the evil Darth Vader, only to be redeemed by his son Luke.   The first three episodes (I-The Phantom Menace, II-Attack Of The Clones, III-Revenge of The Sith) were made two decades after the original trilogy.Although technecally superior than the original trilogy,they lack the passionate storytelling of the earlier movies.   Arriving with universal anticipation from movie goers,I-TPM was a confusing mess with ridiculous dialogue, and clumsy direction(George Lucas hasn't directed a movie in 22 years).Geared more towards children(including the character of Jar Jar Binks),die hard fans cried foul,although the movie made millions.An improvement on TPM,II-AOTC was still a disappointed due to the  script making such talented actors as Natalie Portman,Ewan McGregor,and Hayden Christensen come off as wooden, and stilted.III-ROTS promised to be darker, and and delivers despite it's script and acting flaws.   Released in 1977,the original Star Wars(aka Episode IV-A New Hope) was a hit from the start.Made on a low budget ($11M),it pushed the limits of special effects.Although it had a clumsy script,it made up for it with it's beloved charaters including heroic Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill),fiesty Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher),rogue pilot Han Solo(Harrison Ford), and wise Obi-Wan \\"Ben\\" Kenobi (Alec Guiness).Also introduced were the droid duo of R2-D2(Kenny Baker) and C-3PO(Anthony Daniels),and Solo's loveable Wookie sidekick Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew).V-ESB has aged better than the other movies due to it's superior script,direction(Irwin Kirshner) and special effects.The movie has a darker tone as well as an unexpected endingthat sets up the next chapter,VI-ROTJ .An uneven mix of the previous movies VI-ROTJ is a bit of a letdown after the brilliant ESB.Wrapping up the events of the series ,it brought the series to a grand end.   The DVD edition of the original trilogy includes one disc of extras including behind the scenes,trailers, and other goodies to make the fans drool,including a preview of the yet to be released III-ROTS.
0553573411|4.0|Plot Summary: As described in the countless other reviews, Fitz is a wounded character now due to Prince Regal's treachery in the Mountian Kingdom. He is also being attacked in various ways throughout this book, mentally and physically. All the people he loves and trusts are either dissappearing or being hurt due to their acquaintance with him. The King is dying, the Prince is gunning for the throne and Fitz is stuck between his duty and his desires. Such are the trials of one assassin to the king. <br /> <br />Opinion: I still like the series. In fact I like this book better than the series opener, Assassin's Apprentice. Fitz and his associates are all good characters to read about. I care for them. I hate who I am supposed to hate and suspect who I am supposed to suspect. I was surprised by a few of the twists in the novel, but others were fairly predictable. The story moves along pretty well starting with the return from the Mountain Kingdoms to, interestingly enough, well....I don't want to say how the book ends. The Six Duchies change as much as Fitz does in this book and some of the change (in the characters and in the Duchies) strains credulity but not too much. Overall things take a turn for the worse, one just has to accept the small personal victories as a counterbalance to some of that negativity. <br /> <br />Recommendation: Read it. 4.5 out of 5 stars. I look forward to reading the conclusion to the series
1586215817|4.0|I agree with another reviewer that the best aspect of this book is the love triangle--steamy! My only hesitation with this work was that a few of the twists and turns didn't need to be there--there were enough to keep your interest and a few less might have been less of a distraction. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a page turner. <br />Would also recommend another book I read recently THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD--shocking and not for the fain-of-heart.
0312263120|4.0|All in all, it was a good read. Being a computer programmer myself, I'm naturally pretty critical of the technical aspects of books like this. I'd say Brown did his homework pretty well, with a few minor annoyances. But you can get past them even if you're a technophile, because it has a good pace and keeps your interest. My criticisms are that the one-page chapters that keep you bouncing from character to character to see what they're doing makes me dizzy. I'd rather have seen him develop the characters a bit more so that we could identify with them. David Becker--who knows anything more about him except that he's a teacher? And he seems like a total idiot to keep pursing a dangerous quest that really doesn't seem to have any logical motivations for him. The NSA stereotypical fat slob computer geek Jabba was a bit much for me. Come on! Writers need to start getting away from the computer geek image of the 80's. I've worked for a lot of firms--big and small, and you don't really see characters like that who live on Dr. Pepper and pizza and never see the sunlight. My final annoyance is this--and everyone out there who's ever going to write a book or make a movie, please pay attention. If you're going to use guns in your story, talk to someone who knows them. The assassin character chasing Becker around Spain is said to be using a high-quality silencer, but at one point his weapon is referred to as a &quot;revolver&quot;. You don't put silencers on revolvers. It just doesn't work. You put them on semi-automatic pistols. This assassin would have had something pretty leading edge. Probably a compact automatic like a Walther. And the guys chasing each other around the NSA crypto lab are using Berrettas. Those went out with Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon. A Glock might have been a bit more with-the-times. Or a SIG. DESPITE my complaints, this was a good techno-thriller and worth reading!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I'm not sure what it is about this movie that keeps drawing me to it. It's just one of those films that I'm able to watch again and again. Alot of people don't seem to grasp it's purpose - I suppose the plot can seem a bit shallow, and the characters are sort of &quot;stuck&quot; throughout most of the movie, but I thought the problems they were facing were so down to earth. (??) Charlotte is facing that postcollege dead end, pondering what else life has to offer when she meets her soul mate Bob Harris, a has-been actor going through his midlife crisis. They don't fall into some scandalous affair as you might think, but keep their mutual love at a friendly relationship - regardless of all the possibilities they had. It was very atmospheric and just laid back. I guess that's why so many reviewers either fall in love with it or, rather, just blow it off. It's certainly not a movie for everyone. But regardless of what you felt about this movie you don't have to command people not to go see it. People can make their own decisions. Just be open-minded.      I'm reading so much crap from people who claim to be the exclusively normal ones for not liking this film. You're being ridiculous so don't make yourself out to be better or true to your own oppinions. I don't like this movie because I want to be revered as some creative intellectual - I just like it for what it is.

With virtually unparalleled deftness, he weaves together a plot that caters perfectly to this intended audience: flat characters (because people want this book to be a simple read), an obsession with the occult and conspiracy (facilitates desperately sought-after escapism), and high adventure (in the cast of Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider). Secondly, he panders to a theory of the \\"sacred feminine\\" that has been en vogue since the publication of The Gnostic Gospels in 1979, giving it a flair of realism unachieved in earlier works.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, Brown's skills stop there--in a mirage of realism. At a very superficial level, this mirage of realism can be seen in the quality of his prose. While Brown's description of sweeping landscapes and pulsating action at first can leave a reader benumbed, a close reading of the text reveals its lack of depth. Rightfully has the text been bemoaned as \\"uninspiring\\" and \\"flat\\". Correctly, also, has the logic ostensibly holding the story together been lambasted as \\"bordering on non sequitur\\".<br /><br /> This mirage of writing adroitness is the least of Brown's concerns, however. What wrenches any shred of legitimacy or hint of true scholarship from the text is the porous nature of its presented facts. Time and again, Brown shows a complete ignorance of basic art, historical, and literary facts. Indeed, it is rare to find a single substantiated claim in his supposedly \\"meticulously-researched\\" work. While this may be attributed to the scope and ambitiousness of the topics covered, such attribution can scarcely defend the rampant incongruity between Brown's assertions and universally established and historically-corroborated facts.<br /><br /> To mention but a few of the grotesque errors and outright fabrications that form the very foundation for his plot would result in a book review almost as long as Brown's tome itself. As such, I have chosen to forego enumerating even the most salient of these in this review. In doing so, I imitate Brown's own style of poor citation. However, unlike Brown, I herein give the readers access to primary sources to demonstrate his shoddy scholarship. For the true historian, philosopher, student, and anyone else open-mindedly in pursuit of historical truth, I suggest reference to all of the links that can be found at the bottom of this review.<br /><br /> Please note that the following links represent a broad spectrum of theological and political viewpoints. I have intentionally done this so as to lessen the probability of institutional revisionism. To the same end, I have favored secular sources over religious ones. All the authors to whose pages this review is linked are world-renowned experts in the fields of art history, the occult, and the history of religion. It is they who have felt most repulsed by Brown's patent ignorance of their disciplines. And it is they who have spilled the most ink in debunking it.<br /><br />(...)for his plot would result in a book review almost as long as Brown's tome itself.

B000002H2H|4.0|The main reason I only rated this album at 4 stars was that in my opinion it is not as consistent as some of Metallica's other records. There is quite a mix of material, ranging in my opinion from the sub-standard to the excellent. The album has a very morbid theme to it, with each song revolving around the topic of death. There are a couple of songs that stand out way above the rest, namely For Whom The Bell Tolls and Fade To Black.      The opening track, Fight Fire With Fire, has a slow intro before breaking into one of Metallica's fastest ever songs. This attack on nuclear warfare is, in my opinion, the worst song on the album and receives just four out of ten from me. Hetfields vocals are poor and the song is dull.      The title track, Ride The Lightning, focuses on the electric chair. The song is quite good, with a good guitar solo. Hetfield screams a bit too much. Six out of ten.      For Whom The Bell Tolls, on the other hand, is one of Metallica's greatest ever songs. Hammett's fast guitar riff is brilliant, as are Hetfield's vocals. The lyrics are also great and convey a very clear message about war. The song's main downfall is that it only has two verses and a short chorus. There are two minutes of music before the vocals start, and before you know it the main part of the song is over, and the fade-out is just a dull, repetitive racket that lasts for ages. Nevertheless, the brilliant lyrics, vocals and guitar-work earn the song an overall nine out of ten from me.      Track four, Fade To Black, contends closely with One for the title of 'Metallica's greatest song' in my opinion. A brilliant, soft intro, soft, moving verses (on the topic of suicide), and and a massive guitar solo lasting several minutes until the fade-out. The one thing I would change would be to add more vocals - they're the best part of the song. At least ten out of ten.      Trapped Under Ice: good bit in the middle. Otherwise sub-standard - five out of ten. I will say no more.      Escape, despite being short (by Metallica standards - less than four minutes I think) has quite good verses and a very good chorus. The riff is great ... seven out of ten.      Ride The Lightning's penultimate track, Creeping Death, has a biblical theme, centred around the book of Exodus. Great verses, brilliant chorus. Magnificent guitar solo. Then there's the part, &quot;Die, by my hand, I creep across the land, killing first-born man&quot; which should always be played as loud as you possibly can without the neighbours taking you to court. Out of ten, I'll give it nine.      The Call Of Ktulu (can anyone tell me what the Ktulu is supposed to be?) is a brilliant instrumental - great end to the album. It starts off soft, with an eerie sound, before breaking into a great, heavy riff that won't leave your head for days. Nine out of ten would probably be my rating. Don't let the filler put you off - this album is worth ordering just for the best few songs alone.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't really watch TV, but when I first saw Firefly, I was hooked; my girlfriend at the time brought me into watching it. When Firefly left the airwaves, I stopped watching TV again and went back to DVDs.<br /><br />TV is at a sad state when they allow all the horrible reality TV shows to continue, yet not allow series such as Firefly to remain and truly entertain.<br /><br />Stupid Fox executives! Although I am loathe to put more money into their coffers for cancelling Firefly, I can't help but add this to my discriminating collection.
B000002H6C|5.0|I will not say that this is definitely Metallica's best album, because each album has its own different style and therefore is brilliant in its own right.  There is a significant change in style from the band's previous record, Master Of Puppets, probably due to the adoption of Jason Newsted as their bassist after Cliff Burton's tragic death.  ...And Justice For All is more consistent than Metallica's previous albums, with fast, catchy riffs and thought-provoking lyrics from start to finish.  Hammett's solos are as brilliant as ever and Ulrich's drumming is also great; for best results the album should be played on a high bass setting as there are many parts where Jason Newsted can hardly be heard at all. <br />  <br />The first track, Blackened, starts off with an excellent intro (possibly one of the best sounding parts of the album) before bursting into a brilliant, high-tempo riff that sticks in your head for days afterwards.  The guitar solo is brilliant, one of the very best on the album, and is accompanied by a good bass-line and excellent drumming.  The lyrics are on a similar topic to those of Ride The Lightning's opening track, Fight Fire With Fire - though much better.  I'd rate this track eight out of ten. <br /> <br />...And Justice For All: the title track also receives an eight out of ten from me, despite clocking up over nine minutes.  The guitar solo is excellent and the lyrics leave a definite impression on the listener. <br /> <br />Track three, Eye Of The Beholder, has a repetitive but good fade-in before breaking into a bouncy, high-bass riff that I rate as another of the album's best moments.  Lyrics great, solo satisfactory ... an overall seven out of ten. <br /> <br />If you are at all a fan of Metallica then you will probably agree that the next track, One, is among the best songs ever written.  With a soft, gentle intro and two brilliant verses, heavy chorus (though lacking in bass), before becoming much heavier and faster throughout the remainder of the song, revolutionary lyrics and probably one of the world's best guitar solos, One is arguably Metallica's best ever work.  Lars Ulrich's drumming is brilliant, particularly with the double bass pedal later on in the song, most noticeable at one point where the guitar dies away leaving only the drumming audible.  Towards the end the song builds up to an impressive climax before a coming to a sudden, abrupt end.  Ten out of ten wouldn't do it justice - I'll give it twenty.  Couldn't be better. <br /> <br />Track five is The Shortest Straw ... it lets the album down.  It probably seems worse simply because it follows One, and is therefore a large step down in quality.  I'll give it a mere five out of ten. <br /> <br />Harvester Of Sorrow has a great intro and great lyrics too.  It has a distinctively dark and eerie sound to it, not just in the guitar of the intro (which also appears in the background later on in the song) but in Hetfield's harsh vocals.  The guitar solo is absolutely brilliant and I will therefore give the song an overall eight of a possible ten. <br /> <br />I had difficulty rating the next track, Frayed Ends Of Sanity, but eventually settled with eight out of ten.  This is because I think the verses could be better but the chorus is great ... and there is a good guitar solo in there as well, as well as a couple of brilliant-sounding, high-tempo instrumentals which, though repetitive, stick in your head for weeks. <br /> <br />To Live Is To Die is an amazing instrumental which appears to be a tribute to Cliff Burton, as the four lines of vocals are apparently taken from poetry written by the late bassist.  The song has a phenomenal intro and outro, with soft, melodic guitar and a slow tempo.  The majority of the song is heavy but also quite slow and sad.  There is also an amazing soft part around the middle of the song, where everything else fades away leaving only soft, slow guitar similar to that of the start and end.  There are also afew good, fast guitar solos - among the best in the album.  Brilliant - ten out of ten, full marks.  A great reason to buy the album. <br /> <br />The final track, Dyer's Eve, has an odd title but the music and in particular the lyrics are awesome.  With really fast, high tempo riffs, and fast bass drumming throughout the verses, the song has a great sound.  The lyrics are violent and aggressive and Hetfield's harsh vocals are great.  The song is great if you are annoyed at your parents as well (Dear Mother, Dear Father, Every thought I think you disapprove, Curator, Dictator, Always censoring my every move, Children are seen but are not heard, Tear out everything inspired ...).  Good guitar solo too, a definite nine out of ten at least.
B00005JN2X|5.0|Well worth seeing, more than the usual twists and turns, although I do have to say the ending may be hotly debated by viewers - good or bad? Even so, go see this one to see Tom Cruise departs from his usual &quot;good guy saves the world&quot; persona, playing a hit man who encounters an unwitting cabdriver and makes him part of his game plan.<br /><br /> A solid and riveting movie, with a bit of philosophy thrown in, just enough to keep things from being formulaic, as Cruise and the cabbie debate ethics. Try to see it in a theatre without too many people or distractions so you can give it your full concentrations - and don't buy too much soda. You're not going to want to miss a moment of this one, let alone for a restroom break.<br /><br /> Won't say more, this is one plot that doesn't deserve any spoilers.
B0001I55SS|3.0|How can one rate this movie when it has so many beautifully blended elements with so many gratingly annoying ones? <br />  <br /> Plus sides: <br />  <br /> 1. The Cygnus emanates a deep sense of forboding throughout the movie. <br /> 2. The Cygnus' captain, a somewhat Nemo-construct, plays off the elements of being a crazed genius wonderfully. <br /> 3. The musical element to this film is astounding. I can still remember the chills of the musical crescendo as the Cygnus first lights up. <br /> 4. Maximillian makes one hell of a scary, scary robot and it surprised me that Anthony Perkins' death in the movie still allowed a PG rating. Keep in mind, I was 9 years old when I saw this!! Watching somebody get their insides spun around by rotating claws (even if you don't actually see blood or guts) is still pretty raw. <br />  <br /> Minuses: <br /> 1. Ok, for the most part, I liked VINCENT. Even as a youngster, though, I hated BOB. HATED HATED HATED. That &quot;old prospector&quot; voice was annoying. <br /> 2. The most hilarious part is when our beloved captain rescues the damsel in distress. The music is triumphant and soaring, but he still manages a rather wimpy &quot;ow&quot; as he gets himself barely clunked by an attacking robot. <br /> 3. The whole STARR scene. VINCENT versus STARR. Was there a point to this scene beyond showing off effects? Even as a 9 year old, I was pretty much fast-forwarding through it. <br /> 4. Yikes...we're in outer space, people!! Even when I was 9, I knew that you did not have ANY air in outer space. Still, having a meteor rip through the garden and having our crew moseying around in outer space trying to get on to an escape rocket was hard for me to swallow. It was just plain WRONG. <br /> 5. Heaven/hell scene. Theology aside, why does the crew go to hell and the Cygnus captain goes to (although somewhat half-way; see the movie and you'll catch my drift) heaven? Does this imply that even if you make zombies out of your crew and a robotout of your XO, that you are still redeemed because you &quot;had a vision?&quot; Sorry, write me out of that one. <br />  <br /> It is so hard to rate this film as a result. Despite its cons, there are its pros and if there were ever a movie that had something similar to bipolar disorder, this is the one. I still think it's worth checking out.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I've been reading through many of these reviews and what I tend to see from the lower ranked reviews is that they didn't like the camera &quot;tricks&quot;. Aronofsky didn't do that to be edgy or &quot;hip&quot; he did that because when your on amphetamines, you &quot;speed&quot; up, and &quot;slow (crash) down. He's trying to give you the experience of the addiction. The vien collapsing and the cutting off the arm isn't shock, its real. That's what can happen in the worst cases. Still, something to be watched, a beauty of a picutre acting/directing/score wise.
0385720920|5.0|One of the knocks I have heard about this book is that Palahniuk writes books that are all in the same vein, and this one is a lot like Fight Club.  I agree that this book is a bit similiar...but I fail to see how that is a bad thing.  This book is filled with Truth about our modern society.  Anyone who thought that Fight Club was cool because they turned out to be one person might not like this book.  Anyone who thought that Tyler Durden was making more than a little sense, will find this book informative.
B00000373U|5.0|This album is--hmmm, what's an accurate way of putting this?--FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE! Seriously, this is absolutely one of the most flawless albums I've heard in years--and I hear A LOT of albums. Honestly, by the mid-90s I had given up on 'alternative' rock music (wow, it hurts just to type that phrase) and I still do not like or listen to it, minus a few notable exceptions. For years, it's felt as though American rock music was completely tired and played out and noisy electronic stuff was the only thing that sounded unusual or fresh to me... <br /> But then I heard this timeless and achingly beautiful music from a tragic man who was already dead by the time I discovered him. I get the same feeling from Elliot Smith as I get when I hear the music of Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Kurt cobain, Bradley Nowell, etc.--it's sentimental and nostalgic and you only wish they could somehow come back but at the same time you are nothing but grateful that you got to experience the beautiful gift that these strangers had for you. <br /> Like Hendrix said, &quot;This one's for all of you with hearts and ears...&quot;
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This album is great, my fave songs are &quot;Together&quot;, &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; & &quot;Freak Out&quot;. I don't care if she's pop, this is good pop. Avril is hot and has an amazing voice. And this is coming from a System of a Down fan. <br /> I appreciate a well written song, and this album if full of them.
1594200106|5.0|I no longer recall how I was alerted to this marvelous, especially suberb novel for bibliophiles. No matter, it's finest kind of reading, I assure you. It's not perfect but you won't care once you settle down with it. The first chapter is titled &quot;The Book Cemetery&quot; -- just wait 'til you read about this place. It's where I want to work and die!<br /><br /> In many ways this novel is an exceptionally Spanish mystery/thriller; there's philosophy, religion, intense passion, historical roots, mysticism and more. Barcelona comes alive in full color for the reader while the implications of the Spanish Civil War and its Francoist aftermath is presented clearly. Utterly splendid reading book.
B000007T1M|4.0|How can you say Daron is a terrible song writer, and yes he does have solos, listen to Soil, there is a solo on that and it kicks ass. This is SOAD's worst album, there is too much screaming on here for my personal taste, I prefer the new melodic SOAD. Spiders is an absolute masterpiece. <br /> And Karl you say RATM are more poetic than SOAD, don't make me laugh mate, whats so poetic about &quot;Yo its just anotha Bomb track&quot;. SOAD are far more poetic e.g. &quot;Plagiarised existence exist, forewarned customary spirits&quot; You see, read that you might learn something boy. Don't ever diss Malakian again, the man is a genius.
B00028HBKM|5.0|One of the great reasons for buying DVD's is the extras. This movie is great, but the DVD is the same thing as you saw on the big screen, no interviews, no commentaries, no deleted scenes, just the trailers and that's it. I would love at least to hear Mel's opinion on such a controversial film, but the fact that this DVD is so pale without any extras makes me wonder if it Gibson is waiting to release another DVD (Special Edition, Collector's Edition, Blessed by the Pope Edition or whatever you want to call it). Is Mel trying to take more from us?<br /><br />Anyway the movie is great, and the controversy was all taken out of proportion, the movie is violent but the Turin's cloak and other studies have proven that Christ's death was violent. This movie will help the christian people to see and contemplate more on our Lord suffering for us.<br /><br />PS: This space is to make an opinion of the movie, not to make a theological rapport on Jesus and if it was really the Son of God or not. This is for the movie/DVD opinion. So those (like the guy in Tampa, FL) opinions please take notice that those are out of place.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Firstly can I just say Octavius doesn't know what he's talking about. The plot here is not ridiculous, yes this sort of thing may not happen very often in real life but its a movie....DUH! This film is not perverse in any way, they have a father daughter relationship, what is perverse about this? Her real Dad didn't care about her so she looked to Leon as a father figure and Leon was a loner who had no family and meeting Mathilda, as he said, gave him a thurst for life and he didn't want to be a killer any more, so your point that he shouldn't care about the girl is ridiculous, everyone is capable of loving & caring for someone no matter what you do for a living. And you say he isn't professional? Did you see the way he killed people? Or were you watching a different movie? <br />This is one of the best movies ever, I can watch it again & again, its so moving. The acting is superb, Jean Reno, Natalie  Portman, Gary Oldman & Danny Aiello give phenominal performances. Video quality is excellent with some really nice shots of NYC.
B00005YUAC|5.0|It'a amazing.  Hardly no one knows about this wonderful rock album! It's a darn shame. This is beautiful and complex progressive rock dominated with jazzy, electric guitar. The early 70's had a ton of great music: not just prog-rock but it seemed like ALL the music back then was really good. I think Camel's first album stands up with all that excellent 70's music.     I don't know what it is about Camel's debut that makes it so great. I can tell you one thing, it took a few serious listens to get into this album. The instrumental parts (which is a HUGE portion of the album) REALLY jump all over the place, going from one beautiful guitar melody straight into another, without letting up.  We're talking some *serious* jumping!      Because the instrumental parts are all over the place, it takes time to remember the music but I guarantee if you're a big prog-rock fan eventually the instrumental shifts will click and become exciting for you.      It's funny though, because as complex and melodic as the many guitar parts on this album are, the singer gives the listener very simple melodies that should take NO time at all getting into.      Let me mention a few of the songs. \\"Mystic Queen\\" and \\"Never Let Go\\" give me the strangest pictures. I don't know what it is about these two songs, but unusual feelings enter the dreamy part of my head every time I listen to them. It's weird because both of these songs are beautiful and soothing, and yet so DARK and haunting at the same time!  Nothing should be giving off such strong, creepy feelings. Right now I can't think of another album that gives me the creeps more than this album. And I can't understand why! Something in the music scares the crap out of me and I'll probably never figure out what it is.  That's the fun thing about Camel's debut.     I just have to say it- Camel has a PERFECT guitar sound.  It's impossible to hate it. Pink Floyd's guitar sound is a favorite to many people, but there's something about Camel's soothing and brilliant guitar sound that really keeps your attention (once you get into the complex guitar melodies, that is).      If you like the instrumental parts of Genesis or King Crimson's music, PLEASE give this album a try. Camel may not be as diverse as Genesis or King Crimson, and certainly not as influential, but that's okay because Camel can be known for having the perfect guitar sound. If someone told me that they hate the sound of the guitar on this album, I wouldn't believe them!      Camel never had another album quite like this one. The electric guitar is really noticeable throughout the album, along with the keyboard and the heavy, constant drumming (which sound REALLY cool if you have a good stereo set-up). I think \\"Slow Yourself Down\\" could pass for a Santana song. \\"Arubaluba\\" is a strange standout because it's almost like surf-rock.     Look at me, I need to stop writing this review because I've said quite a lot already, and you're probably tired of reading my review! Just remember this-      Camel's debut- The electric guitar is relaxing, exciting and melodic all at the same time, the keyboards are haunting, the male singer has a soothing voice and he sings nice, peaceful and simple vocal melodies. If this sounds good to you then pick it up and enjoy!
B000066NW0|4.0|This may sound weird coming from a System of a Down fan but I can't help it, her songs are so damn catchy, she's gorgeous too. I'd consider this to be guitar pop, not lame bubblegum pop like Nsync. I think Avril is a great singer and this album is full of well written songs like &quot;Complicated&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;My World&quot; & &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;. I listen to Avril when I want something mellow, you can only listen to so much SOAD before your ears start to bleed. We all need our chill out music and this is it for me. I know a guy who listens to underground death metal music and he confessed to me that he was a secret Avril fan and that he was going to one of her concerts and took his niece there as a cover up. This album is full of catchy songs that only a deaf person wouldn't enjoy.
0714843377|5.0|The world's best-selling book? Presumably the cover line is being clever and this is merely the world's best-selling book that has been written by Paul Arden.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Oh look its KarlMarx again dissing the Gods that are SOAD. He must be deaf if he thinks SOAD suck and and wtf do you mean this is their worst album?  No way their worst album is the first one, Steal This Album is an amazing album. RATM could never make an album like this, Serj sounds better than ever and Daron Malakian uses a lot of acoustic guitar showing everyone how much of a talented versatile guitarist he is.<br /><br />Don't listen to Karl Marx he's just bitter because Zach has disappeared into oblivion, still working on his solo album? ROFLMAO, he's been working on that for about 6 years dude, Malakian writes an album in about 2 months and Zach takes 6 years? LMAO. You will have gray hairs  by the time Zach's pathetic solo album is released. Steal This Album is a masterpiece,  SOAD rules,  Malakian is god.
6300271439|5.0|Who's That Girl may not have been a hit at the box office (but in it's defense, it was released during the summer sleeper season and may have faired better in another time of year.)   This film is FUNNY!  Every time I watch it I find more humor in it than I did before, and Madonna really pulls off her character.  I felt the supporting cast was more of a damper than anything, and the film could have been structured better.  But it's a silly comedy, kind of the point.  Madonna plays an ex-com attempting to clear her name for murdering her boyfriend.  Enter a lawyer hired by the real killer to try and get her out of town, and all sorts of funny dramatics begin.  And Murray, the Pategonia Felix tiger is just adorable.   <br /> <br />Give it a shot!  And I hope this arrives on DVD one day soon!
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I recommend this dvd to anyone who is a fan of Angelina, you are not supposed to take this movie seriously, its just a fun chill out movie. The picture quality is amazing and its packed full of extras. If you love Angie buy this!
0385336810|5.0|GREAT job Ms. Kinsella!! I personally thought this book was better than the Shopaholics... a review below mentioned that Emma's faults weren't as defined as Becky's, well that is one reason I liked it better. Becky got a little predictable. <br />  <br /> This book made me laugh OUT LOUD while I was reading. My husband kept looking at me like I was crazy, as I burst into giggles and at one point, cackles... and he said &quot;what's so funny?&quot; and all I could choke out was &quot;FALSE TEETH!!!&quot;  <br />  <br /> During one whole part of the book I was crying too... tears pouring down my face, where is the kleenex, I can't see the book to read crying. (Ok, I guess I should add a disclaimer here that I'm pregnant so it's possible I'm a *little* emotionally challenged, hehe) <br />  <br /> I couldn't put it down. I picked it up after work, stopped reading to go out for dinner, resumed reading and pulled an &quot;oh dear, is it midnight already? but I have to finish this!&quot; <br />  <br /> I highly recommend it. A++!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I'm glad Zach threw his dummy out of the pram and quit RATM  so he could concentrate on his (6 years in the making) solo album because the musicians of RATM deserved a better singer and they got it in Chris Cornell. Cornell's powerful vocals meshed with Morello's trademark riffs & out of this world guitar solos backed up by Tim Commerford's thumping funky bass lines & Brad Wilk's tight, hard hitting drumming makes for an explosive 1 hour of music. The best track here is Like a Stone. Morello is such an amazing, inventive guitarist. These guys are so much better without the dreadlocked whiney mommy's boy. With bands like SOAD, Deftones & Audioslave the future of rock music is looking very bright indeed. <br />
B000286S8S|4.0|BOBW is essential listening for anyone being exposed to Van Halen for the first time, about to embark on a road trip - or both.  As a soundtrack to your last 20 summers, it is best heard full blast and top down.   <br /> <br />As with any Best Of collection, there are always going to be omissions, but then that's why it's an anthology.  If one of your favorite songs is missing, then you probably own the original album anyway. <br /> <br />That said, one fact becomes very obvious in this collection.  The bombast, swagger and ground-breaking urgency of Van Halen disappeared when David Lee Roth exited the band.  In its place came the corporate, safe and formulaic - albeit solid - music of Van Hagar.  The sole exceptions to this complacency are \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" and \\"Right Now.\\" <br /> <br />If the three new tracks are any indication, Van Halen is not aging very well and their best years are clearly in the past.  The new material is pedestrian at best and simply bad at worst. <br /> <br />The Van Halen brothers also seem to reluctantly make a tacit admission that the Roth-fronted material holds up better live, as the three live tracks are Roth's signature songs.  The fact that it isn't vintage live material and instead culled from the Van Hagar live album seems like a flimsy concession to themselves.   <br /> <br />Finally, the fact that not one picture is included of Roth speaks unflattering volumes of the Van Halens' animosity and pettiness toward the co-creator of half this album.   <br />
B000002BE9|5.0|I got this album in 1998, I'd heard a few things about this new singer called Fiona Apple about how she was kind of alternative and different then I heard a clip of her song Criminal & decided to buy this album and I was blown away. This album is alternative without being rock. Its alternative because it has soul, passion, anger, feeling & rawness. Fiona writes all of her songs on her OWN. There are no other names on the credits. I'm sick of solo singers like Aguilera who don't write their own songs or who claim to write their own songs but they hire co-writers to &quot;help&quot; them. Aguilera makes way more money than Fiona when she does stuff all work and just sings on top of some tune someone else wrote. People have such bad taste in music, they just buy whatever is spoon fed to them by MTV. Tidal sold a few million but the music scene was a bit more credible in 1996-1998, also her next album only sold half a million when that was equally as good as this one. <br /> Anyway I love Fiona because her songs are so moving, the melodies are amazing and she has a very soulful jazzy voice. As well as playing piano. What a talent. Her next album &quot;When The Pawn&quot; is also amazing, proving &quot;Tidal&quot; was no fluke. <br /> My fave songs here are Criminal, Never Is a Promise & Sullen Girl. Now this is what you call an amazing female solo artist, not that obnoxious s--t Christina Aguilera. <br /> Tidal rocks even without guitars.
B000002H33|5.0|Danm they don't make them like this anymore thats for damn sure. You don't really get a better Metallica cd then you do with Master Of Puppets except for And Justice For All,But this one might be slightly better.Battery,Damage Inc,Disposable Hero's,and Title Track are all fast paced heavy thrash metal songs that just kick your ass,But Metallica slow it down with more metal tunes like Thing That Should Not Be and Lepper Messiah and the epic power ballad known as Sanatarium.Wow this is really the same band that is responsible for St. Anger what a f***in shame.Kirk rip's out some killer leads he is next to Kerry King probably the best thrash lead giutar player and James crunches the rythm with pounding riffs,Cliff wails on his bass and Lars kicks are asses with his double bass assaults he was a bad-ass before he turned into a loud mouth anti-napster jerk.Metallica are probably along with Slayer the best band of their time.
B0000028RR|4.0|RATM were a great band but I'm afraid that they have been surpassed now since 1998 when a little band from Los Angeles called System of a Down emerged. Morello is an amazing guitarist but he is much more suited to Audioslave because there he has a great singer in Chris Cornell to back him up instead of Zach's whiney high pitched rap vocals. Serj Tankian is a way better singer than Zach any day of the week. Serj can do it all whereas Zach is 1 trick pony. SOAD are far more diverse, melodic and lyrically poetic than RATM.  <br />KarlMarx if you are reading this its time you woke up and quit listening to this boring RATM stuff and started listening to the real deal....SOAD, the greatest band to ever come out of LA, forget RATM, they are over. Morello is awesome but come on Malakian writes all of SOAD's songs he's a genius.    <br />My fave song here is Know Your Enemy,  RATM is a great album but you should buy Toxicity first.
B00020X88O|5.0|What to say about Showgirls? I fell in love with it 10 minutes into my first viewing. I must've seen the film about 50 times since and I still laugh with glee every time. This new V.I.P. edition is for fans like me that love to laugh at Showgirls.<br /><br /> Two shot glasses, a deck of cards, a blindfold, two pasties and a game poster are included along with a deck of five cards with different drinking/stripping games on them. Sadly, only one of the suggested games actually involve watching the movie, but with all this paraphernalia, you're bound to come up with a game or two of your own.<br /><br /> If you're not into playing games, you can enjoy a commentary or watch the film with various trivia and facts appearing on the screen at different times throughout the film. Sadly I didn't care for the commentary too much. David Schmader spends too much of the time saying &quot;Zing!&quot;, making odd breathing sounds into the mic or not saying anything at all for long stretches of time. How he got a name by doing this type of thing I'll never understand. Maybe he's better in person. Still, he delivers the occasional zinger and I found myself laughing at a few of his sparse comments. The best part of his commentary comes during the credits where he goes into a bit more detail about his feelings on the film. Too bad he talks over the credits for only about a minute. The best way to enjoy the commentary is to watch it with the Trivia Track turned on. This way you have something to read when Schmader decides to zone out for 10 minutes.<br /><br /> The Showgirls Diary offers a few brief glimpses of Verhoven's directing. What can I say? It's very entertaining to see him and others taking themselves so seriously. I wish there were more of it. This is without a doubt my favorite special feature on the DVD.<br /><br /> As for the rest of the special features, we get the original trailer and a lesson on how to do a lap dance from two girls of Scores. Fluff. I'll never watch them again. But you can be sure I'll be watching the film for years to come.<br /><br /> I haven't talked much about the film since I assume all who'd be interested in this set would have seen the film at least once. After all, this is set is for die-hard Showgirls fans. Sure, if you're a first-time viewer or a casual fan you'll enjoy the film but to fully enjoy all this set offers you have to be prepared to &quot;leave your inhibitions at the door.&quot;<br /><br /> P.S. My review might sound a bit harsh, but I'm one demanding Showgirls fan so I've weighted my score.ver watch them again.

B0001NBMBC|2.0|Slipknot have hired System of a Down's producer Rick Rubin in a bid to emulate LA's awesome foursome. Well it ain't gonna work because Slipknot don't have half the talent that SOAD have. Rick, quit fooling around with these no hopers and get to work producing SOAD's new album please.
B0002EXH54|5.0|The thing that this album suffered from the most back in 1986 was the production. Even for the time, this was a low-budget production. (Drug Money must have taken precedence over the band at the time.) For example: If you listen to Anthrax's \\"Fistful of Metal\\" which was recorded two years earlier, it even sounds better than the original \\"Peace Sells\\".      But finally the time has arrived, the remaster is here. When I bought it I was struck by how much better you can hear the bassist. I thought the bass lines on the original were great, but thanks to the remaster I just found out how great they all were. The cymbals on the drums are a lot clearer and don't fade into one another like on the original. The snare action is higher pitched and easier to hear than on the original. The part of the drum kit that benefited the most from the remaster was the bass drums. I have 10\\" subwoofers in my car and I can tell you the bass drums hit hard at every part. (The problem with the original was the bass drums would be audible sometimes and impossible to hear at others; in the remaster they are consistent, i.e. always audible.) The vocals are a little bit sharper, and the guitars are more level (volume wise) throughout the album.      This is one of the best remasterings I have ever heard. Dave must have spent a lot of time on this one. Having said this there are some slight downsides. One is on the song \\"The Conjuring\\", a whirling-echoing guitar effect nearly drowns out the end of the Dave's vocal before the song's bridge. Also on \\"Peace Sells\\", the drums song kinda hallow at the beginning. There is also a little bit of background noise. But these are really small complaints compared to this superior product! (For a stylistic review of the album, see my review for the original print.) If you buy the remaster I bet that you will appreciate this already great album in a whole new way.      I really hope they start remastering some of the eighties Thrash stuff. Anthrax and Testament remasters? Probably too much to hope for...     P.S. Don't believe the BS about Dave \\"re-recording\\" parts of this album; that one reviewer seems to believe in fiction as opposed to audio fact. The album they re-recorded parts of was Rust in Peace...and that's only because they lost the vocal tracks. Speaking as someone who has more than adequate training to remaster (Analog-24-bit), the source tape remains the same. I compared it to the original as soon as I bought it. The 700,000 dollar studio decks they have can change the sound of anything...its about knowing how to change it right. Which they have done here. Amen. Buy it. Now.
B000002NIW|5.0|Around The Fur is a masterpiece from start to finish. My Own Summer has one of the best riffs I've ever heard. Be Quiet &  Drive is a masterpiece, this song kinda sounds like Everlong by Foo Fighters. These guys are influenced by bands like Smashing  Pumpkins, The Cure,  Weezer & Radiohead as well as metal bands and you can see that in the music how they mix metal with melodic rock. Abe is a very underrated drummer, he's amazing.
B000001FSU|3.0|On first listen, this album sounds exactly Among the Living ('87) sound production wise. The guitars, drums, vocals and bass all sound like they were recorded the same way as in their '87 release.  <br />  <br /> The first track opens up with violins -very interesting indeed. The guitar lines are generic enough through out the album. Occasionally the guitar duo of Ian and Spitz come up with something truly great, but it usually only lasts as a fill or chorus. The bass lines are equally as faded. <br />  <br /> The drumming is interesting. Benante would later become a much better drummer, but some of his delivery on this album is impressive despite his limited ability during this period. For fans of double-bass, there is quite a bit on this album...like more double-bass than on Among the Living(!) Benante unfortunately overuses the &quot;explosion&quot; beat on this album. Also, Benante has a problem fitting in his on-again-off-again feet (as well as his hands) into the fills. This culminates in rushed drum work. (I.e. some of the drumming sounds &quot;off&quot;.) <br />  <br /> The one truly low point on the album is the obligatory cover of Trust's &quot;Anti-Social&quot;. Was it really necessary? <br />  <br /> Highlights: <br /> The time change-ups are one of the albums highpoints. Rather than stick with some over used tempo they do (much to their credit) change things up quite a bit. The lyrics are suprisingly intelligent for a period and a genera obsecessed with the occult and satanism. But the overall thing that I think helps this album the most is that it is incredibly consistent. There aren't really any great songs here, but there certainly aren't any(?) bad ones either. A solid, albeit confusing, effort that fits nicely in between Among the Living ('87) and Persistence of Time ('90).
B000021YQV|5.0|Ok listen to me KarlMarx you little RATM loving pansey. I agree with what you said about Serj acting stupid sometimes, I too have read interviews and SOAD are trying to be funny and its just annoying but at the end of the day whats that got to do with their music? Their music is original, creative, melodic, intense, exciting & thought provoking, how can you not love it? You say SOAD lyrics are meaningless, what about RATM's awful spelling mistakes? Why do they spell &quot;the&quot; as &quot;da&quot; in their album sleeves. I'm glad the other guys fired Zach's ass and joined Audioslave, that band is so much better without Zach's whiney, high picthed voice. Brandon talks a lot of sense. Karl you are a ******** moron so grow the **** up you ass ******. <br /> Daron Malakian is GOD!!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|The movie is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. For all the people who say that the movie is too violent, what did you expect ! Please remember this, no one can dispute whether or not Christ was actually beaten that brutally or not. No one that is living today was there. Movies are to stretch your imagination a little. The purpose of the violence in the movie to is to give you a sense of guilt. It is placed in the movie to grab your emotion. It is to make you feel remorse for some of the things that you have done in your life and that one man, Jesus, died for those sins so you can go to heaven and be with the Father. If you watch the movie with the notion that this is a violent movie, you have missed the purpose that Mel Gibson was trying to portray. Jesus suffered and sufffered a brutal beating, the ridicual while carrying the cross, and the pain of being crucified all for you and me.  <br />As far as anti-Jew, I could understand why people thought that. However, if you read the Bible, you will understand that the Pharisee thought Jesus was trouble and Jesus was taking their power away. They convinced an already stressed out Pilate to crucify Jesus. <br />Lucifer, the devil, satan is portrayed in this film. Each time s/he (portrayed by a woman) is present it flashes back to a younger Christ and when He could have given in to Satan and not followed through with His destiny and not die for our sins. <br />I recommend anyone who has not seen this movie to see it. I would not recommend this for anyone under the age of 18 or 19. Any younger than this might not be able to comprehend the true meaning of the film. I know a few adults that missed the meaning too. It is a powerful movie that will bring you closer to God and Jesus. If you do not cry by the end of this movie you are a stronger person than I.
B00004Z400|5.0|Deftones are a bloody amazing band. I'd say this is their best album though Around The Fur is very close behind. Abe is my fave drummer, the drum beat to Digital Bath blows me away. Steph's guitar riffs are so melodic & powerful. The production is so clear, the album sounds amazing, you can hear the drums so clearly. The best song has to be Passenger, man that song kicks arse. The last song Pink Maggit is an EPIC. Knife Party is a beautful song, Digital Bath sends shivers up my spine, Change In The House Of Flies is a masterpiece. These guys mix melody with heaviness so well like SOAD. With bands like Deftones & SOAD on the scene rock music is in very safe hands.
B00005JMCN|4.0|A good story about three men and a horse, who all change eachother's lives. Based on a true story, that I knew nothing about before watching the movie, it is set in the early 1900's. <br />The movie does a good job of making you sympathise with all of the characters, including the horse. The dialogue and acting are both superb. <br />The only drawback to this movie, is is predictability. Everything here has been done before in several other movies, but Seabiscuit still does it well. <br />An overall inspiring, and moving story, that kept me interested from start to finish.
0441009425|4.0|I love space opera, and was pretty pleased with this. Although maybe not quite on par with the earlier stuff by Iain Banks (Consider Phlebas, Against a Dark Background), and Vernon Vinge; it is much, much better than Peter Hamilton, which isn't hard sf at all. He writes about disguised zombies, while Reynolds keeps it real. The story is exciting, and of course the secrets should be released little by litte. The person complaining about BIG SECRETS being dumped suddenly really doesn't grasp how a story should unfold, and should stick to kid's novels. Reynolds provides good, hard sf, a little bloated maybe, but not too much, not like the overswelling Hamilton-novels, who seem to decide beforehand to make his novels 1200+ pages. Anyway, I intend to read more of Reynolds, as this was most convincing. But if you haven't read early Banks, I would do that first.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|The movie was interesting, funny, and overall very moving. It was incredibly fun to watch, had a great story and was very well acted. Burton is just about the greatest director and he shows his stuff here. Not as dark and strange as Burton's other works, but definately different.
0920668372|5.0|It's one of the best, most loving stories I've ever read.  Those of you who are creeped out by it are weird.  Are you also creeped out by Captain Hook's fanatical obsession with Peter Pan or the bestial implications of the princess kissing a frog.  God forbid reality and logic don't reign supreme in a child's imagination.
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|While it's not the most thought out and plausable story, this movie is fairly scary and keeps you guessing about what is going to happen next. Good acting from Halle Berry and Robert Downy Jr. give the rating a boost also. If you want to just watch a fun movie on a friday night, you will enjoy this.
B00005JMYG|3.0|Al Franken, Molly Shannon, Chris Farley, Will McDonald, Dana Garvey, Mike Meyers, Adam Sandler, and now Will Ferrell--why do these talented performers dependably crack me up on their SNL 10-minute bits yet leave me constantly looking at my watch during their feature-length movie offerings? Well, for one thing the writing is atrocious--thinly disguised, formulaic soapers with a few \\"F\\" words and whoopee cushion jokes thrown in to justify the length and venue. Characterization is nil--apparently a viewer's prior familiarity with the on-screen personas is considered sufficient--and plots are mono-dramatic situations used as excuses for lame (and loud) verbal and sight gags.<br /><br /> In the case of \\"Anchorman\\" the title says it all. Ferrell plays a vain and fatuous television news anchor whose chief attribute is his hair, which is suddenly under threat by a foxy woman rival with both brains and hair (no matter that the sexist situations and dialogue are at least 30 years out of date). For no reason other than dramatic necessity the two competitive anchors get their act together both romantically and professionally by the end of the movie (which came 60 minutes too late for this viewer).<br /><br /> Just to show you how short this film is on creative ideas, the highlight for me was the voice-over narration supplied by CBS and cable news commentator Bill Kurtis. A close second would be a 5-second out-take from \\"Smokey and the Bandit Part 2.\\" A 3rd would be Tim Robbins' walk-on as a ruthlessly ambitious PBS rep.<br /><br /> I'll be curious to to see how well this film does. Pre-college kids probably won't get the political humor of the opening sketches; college kids couldn't care less; adults find SNL humor, at least since the Belushi-Akroyd days, way beneath them. I have a hunch the makers of this film might wish they had chosen to invest their money in something like \\"Fear Factor: The Movie.\\"<br /><br /> I'm giving the film 3 stars because of Farrell's great comedic potential (he's actually a pretty good musician and dancer) and because he mercifully spared us that noxious cheerleading bit, which is as unfunny as any SNL sketch I've ever seen. Also, his \\"in character\\" interviews in promoting the film were so subtle he had me believing I was watching some of the anchormen from my youth in northern Wisconsin. Finally, the only other spectator in the theater--my wife--claimed that she liked the movie.etty good musician and dancer) and because he mercifully spared us that noxious cheerleading bit, which is as unfunny as any SNL sketch I've ever seen.

B000059XUP|3.0|The sequel to the Crow was a fairly good movie, held back by uninteresting villians that make you go &quot;blah&quot;. I did not like the new main character in this movie at all, but the supporting actress who played Sarah was excellent. The story was just not near as interesting as the first movie, and the actors not near the quality of Brandon Lee.
B0002858YS|5.0|I am not a fan of any other &quot;the&quot; band (Stills, Shins, Strokes, Muse..), but this CD has not left my player. I bought it because when cd's are 6.99 at best buy and it has a nice cover, I figure it's worth a shot. This one far from missed. The rhythms are really cool, which is illustrated right away by the synth/bass part opening to jenny was a friend of mine. my favorite part on the entire album is in mr brightside when he says &quot;no theyre going to bed...and my stomach is sick...but its all in my head and shes touching his....chest now&quot; i feel like theyre like playing with their listeners right there and that's really cool. if you dont end up loving this cd, youll have to appreciate it. YOU BUY NOW, YOU BUY NOW.
B00004RFFS|3.0|Watched Interview with the Vampire for the first time last night. I don't know if my expectations were too high or what, but I was kind of disapointed. <br /> <br />The story is rather interesting and pretty deep. The actors are great, with the exception of Tom Cruise strangely. I did not like how he played the vampire Lestat in this movie at all. Brad Pitt was great, but I think the best performance in the movie goes to Kirsten Dunst. The only time I have ever been that freaked out by a little girl was in the Shining. <br /> <br />The directing was great also, and the special effects were done surprisingly well considering the year the movie was made. <br /> <br />Was a pretty good movie overall.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Saturday Night Live used to do a skit called &quot;Bad Cinema&quot;. This film easly qualifies. It starts slow and never develops into anything. Its not funny, devoid of drama, bla, bla, bla. How this movie was even nominated for any awards--let alone--win any is beyond me.
B00005T30L|3.0|Ghost World, I believe is a very good movie. I just guess I didn't understand it, and that's why I can't give it the points it probably deserves. To me it just seemed boring, and plotless.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Don't buy any DVD's if you don't buy this one! ITS A MUST!!! <br />It also includes the prewiew of Revenge Of The Sith along with TONZ of other extras any DVD hasn't seen before! What more could you want?
B00003CXWV|4.0|Blow is based on the true life of George Jung. He is the man that claims to have smuggled 85% of the cocaine that was in america during the late 70's and early 80's. He had millions upon millions of dollars, and yet was never really happy. <br /> <br />There are few movies that get me as emotionally connected to the characters as this movie did. I knew from the beginning that, after earning tons of money from drug smuggling, he was going to fall hard. <br /> <br />The movie takes a unexpected turn towards the middle, where instead of the fun partying, or negotiating with columbian drug lords, it is more about his relationship with his daughter, and his relationship with his father. <br /> <br />The story is interesting, Johnny Depp plays this character with more emotion than I have seen him play in any other movie, and it is well directed and moving.
038073186X|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book!!! Although, I didn't so much care for the ending, the story is so AWESOME, it doesn't even matter!!! I could not put it down. If you like thrillers or mysteries, this is sooooo the book for you!!! Put it on your list, you will NOT be disappointed.
B00005JL78|5.0|Although I missed a little bit of this movie because the DVD would not stop skipping in certain parts, this movie was absolutely incredible. The story is something fairly original, and unexpected. The acting is top notch, with performances by Cruise and Farrell that are pretty much the best they will ever do. The special effects are believable and fun to watch. This is an all around great sci-fi movie. I classify it as a mix between Blade Runner and Dirty Harry.
0061015725|5.0|Michael Crichton is one of my very favorite authors. I absolutely LOVE all but two of his books. The thing that really gets me about Crichton is the science of the things he writes about, right now most of it is impossible, but if you think in terms of technological advances, in the next ten to twenty years or so, all of this stuff seems plausible and even likely. This one is no different. It is frightening, because as technology, specifically nanotechnology moves forward, something very like this could happen. I said COULD, not that it will. Read this book if you like Crichton and have any sort of interest in science and technology. It will make you think.
B00028HBKM|2.0|I knew when I first saw previews for this movie and started hearing things about it, that I would not want to go see it, and if, for some reason, I did end up watching it, I would not like it. I was correct. <br /> <br />First and foremost, this movie was incredibly boring. A good majority of the movie is spent watching Jesus get beat, hit, cut, or stabbed. I see no reason why anyone would enjoy watching this unless he is a sadist. <br />The movie would get much lower than a five if it weren't for the scenes where it shows flashbacks that Jesus has with him spending time with his apostles. These scenes are uplifting, interesting, and sometimes humorous. The rest of the movie is just a bloody mess that seems to focus more on making you cringe than making you feel sympathetic.
B00006878K|5.0|There are some excellent Albert box sets that include a lot of this stuff, there are some older records that have a great,swingier feel, and some newer things that may appeal more to younger listeners, BUT, this is the one that put King on the -map-. Booker T & the MGs lay down  what have since proven to be the ultimate classic modern blues grooves,(produced by their drummer Al Jackson, the best ever),Albert simmers, smokes, and burns these tunes to the ground.
B0002234LS|4.0|I went to see this movie with high expectations and usually, when i do that, those expectations are not reached. This time they were. <br /> <br />Every scene in this movie includes Johnny Depp, so he had to convey all the emotion of the movie, and single-handedly draw the audience into the story. He does this very, very well. He brings out all the idiosyncrasies in this character and does a good job of getting the audience to sympathize with him. <br /> <br />The director did a good job in his storytelling also, having just the right amount of suspense to keep everybody interested until the very end. <br /> <br />That is the most important part of the story: the ending; and this one has a good one. This ending is perfect.
B0000064TT|3.0|Die hard Dregs fans are probably going to hate me for this, but I find this one of the Dreg's less inspired albums. The energy and sense of fun was all but gone by this point in the band's history, leaving only the Dreg's superb musicianship and intricate charts. The one exception is the chicken pickin' blowout \\"Gina Lola Breakdown,\\" which is the only thing that saves \\"What If\\" from a two-star rating. Casual listeners should get \\"Freefall\\" and \\"Night of the Living Dregs,\\" both fantastic albums which neatly encapsulate what the Dregs are all about, i.e. a coherent and entertaining fusion of funk, country, jazz, classical, and rock music. Die hard fans (of which I am one) will want to get everything up to 1980's \\"Dregs of the Earth.\\" Avoid \\"Bring 'Em Back Alive,\\" the unfortunate 90s Dregs reunion.

B000067J1H|4.0|Fight Club I was fairly surprised with. I did not expect it to be as psychological as it was, and was sort of taken back by the whole story. I guessed the ending WAY before it happened, but it was still in a way surprising. The story, along with Pitt and Norton's performances make this movie well worth seeing and one of the most rememberable movies I have seen in quite a while.
1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon is a very unique work that I enjoyed reading very much.  The book's narration from the point of view of the mentally challenged and at the same time mentally gifted Christopher Boone is extremely powerful and believable.  The book has several unpredictable twists and turns in its plot and many mind-enriching diversions from the mind of Christopher.  While The Curious Incident is a pleasure to read, it also represents the struggles and passions in life that most of us go through: alienation, fear, family troubles, our purpose/destiny, love, and forgiveness.  I highly recommend this book, one of the most original books I've ever read.
B0001HAISG|3.0|There are some things that I really love about this movie. I love Jason Isaacs as Hook, I've always loved the story, and I like it that this is a bit darker than the other versions of Peter Pan. They really have a chance to show Peter as a real person, with feeling and emotions, instead of just an always happy little boy. <br /> <br />But this movie is flawed from the beginning. It is entirely too childish for most adults to enjoy, and children will like the cartoon version better and will not understand many of the jokes and conversations. It seems the perfect live action Peter Pan movie can never be made.
9626341041|5.0|I was looking for a unabriged copy of Pridge and Prejudice by Jane Austen when I came across the Naxos version.  While it's a very VERY well done, I wish it had been marked as Abridged.  However, if you want a quick enjoyable listen - this is the cd to get! :)
B00005JLXE|2.0|Daredevil [ Movies ] <br />  <br /> MY CURRENT RATINGS: <br /> ROTTEN: 5/10 5/10 Movie: Daredevil (2003) <br />  <br />  <br /> It seems like every time I watch this movie, I find more things that I like about it, and more things that I hate. <br /> I like the characters, and the interaction between them. I think the director did a good job with symbolization and art design. I think overall the story is great also, and most of the dialogue is pretty good, but there are just a few things about it I just can't stand. <br />  <br /> * The kid that is supposed to be playing Matt Murdock at the beginning of the movie does great, until he goes blind and gets his superhuman senses. After that, it just seems kind of stupid. <br /> * The scene where Matt chases down Elektra, and the two people who had never before met, bust out into a fight in the middle of a park for no apparent reason. <br /> * Michael Clarke Duncan looks way too nice to be the Kingpin. <br />  <br /> There are some other little things that bother me about this movie also. Like where did Matt Murdock get all the money needed to buy all the little gadgets he has? Why does Matt always take off his sunglasses or open his eyes to &quot;see&quot; things, when he doesn't even use his eyes to see? <br /> Bah, why does almost every comic book movie that comes out have to be crap?
B000286S8S|1.0|David Lee Roth IS Van Halen. All you need to do to prove that is listen to classic Van Halen and compare it to Dave's solo stuff and then to Van Hagar. It will be obvious then that Dave is the heart and soul of this band.      The title of this should be &quot;Some Good Songs From A Great World And Some Garbage From Another World&quot;. Sammy Hagar destroyed this band (or perhaps Eddie Van Halen destroyed it by letting Sammy Hagar into it). Van Hagar is nothing more than a second rate version of Journey.      The fact that live versions of classic Van Halen songs are on here sung by Sammy Hagar is all you need to know to prove the sorry state of this band (and Eddie Van Halen's mind).      To sum it up. Don't buy this garbage. Go buy a David Lee Roth solo CD like DLR Band, Skyscraper, or Diamond Dave.
B00000G3Q4|3.0|I watched The Evil Dead because I have heard so much about it over the course of my life, so I figured I have to watch it sometime. I can't believe this movie got a 100% here. I'm sure it was meant to be cheesy, but it was really neither funny, nor scary, but as a very low budget movie, it was decent. It was however, the bloodiest, goriest, grossest movie I have seen. EVER. But the special effects are so stupid looking, it doesn't really even gross you out or make you gasp or anything... just kinda looks funny.
B000286RKW|5.0|Man. I'll tell you, me and my buddies get together every christmas and watch this flick. It's the movie that let me know I wanted to make movies. I cried when it was over, not cause it was sad (obviously) but because...THE PIANO EXIT! How can you not get teared up at this masterpiece? I respect Godfather, I grew up with Scarface, but goodfellas is the film I LOVE. Hell, i've even read Wiseguy to death!
B000059XUO|3.0|Watched The Crow for the first time ever last night. I had heard things about this movie for just about all of my life, but just never felt like picking it up. I had heard about how dark the art and story is, and about how Brandon Lee died during filming, but I knew absolutely nothing about the story, and did not know what to expect when the movie started playing. I think this is probably the best way to go into a movie, and I was very pleased. <br /> <br />The movie's artistic direction, along with Brandon Lee's performance, make The Crow enjoyable for the entire 2 hours, and the action and violence keeps you glued to the screen. <br /> <br />My only complaint is with the story, which I understand they had to cut character development scenes and rewrite other scenes to finish after Brandon Lee's untimely death. It is a typical story mostly, of a man who comes back from the dead to avenge his girlfriends death. The story is mainly just there as a reason for him to be going about killing various people. However, it is told well through good dialogue and well-directed scenes, and remains very enjoyable. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this movie, be sure to pick it up sometime.
B00005JMEW|5.0|My second favorite movie of last year, only below Return of the King, this movie just rocks. The movie is so stylish that it makes you want to watch every frame, afraid that if you blink you will miss something. The soundtrack works perfect with the video. Uma Thurman is the epitimy of badass. Some people complain about the blood and the action sequences not being realistic, I say if you want realistic action sequences, watch boxing. The action in this movie is stylish and fun. I can't wait to see Volume 2.
B00003CXA3|3.0|Maybe the years just didn't do this movie justice, but I did not think this 1971 oscar winner was anything extroidanary. It was a well acted, well directed cop drama with some good action scenes. Gene Hackman is defined by his role in this movie. His character reminds me of Tony Soprano, except on the other end of the law. After playing Mafia for a couple weeks, I think that the game designers who made Mafia must have been watching a lot of this movie, because there are too many similarities to be a coincidence, not in story, but in setting and in some of the action sequences. <br />Overall, this was a decent movie, but I was not impressed at all by the ending, which may be why I'm giving it a low score now. It dragged on some times when it should have just moved on to the next scene. Good movie to watch after a lazy sunday dinner.
0156027321|5.0|It has been a long time since a book &quot;blew me away.&quot; I picked up this book because it won the Booker Prize (reliably indicates a terrific book). After looking at the cover and reading the blurbs I was hesitant to even begin reading it. It seemed like it might be sort of &quot;corny.&quot; Well it wasn't. The ending of this book - to use an old fashioned phrase - blew my mind. Highly recommended.
B0001EFTVA|2.0|\\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" is not, as the title would suggest, a film about the Japanese mafia, but rather a sentimental fable about three homeless people - a destitute gambler, a lovesick transvestite and an ill-tempered runaway - who find an abandoned newborn babe, wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a dumpster, on Christmas Day.  The film recounts their journey through the city as they search for the little girl's mother.<br /><br />This animated feature is indeed lovely to look at, capturing the stark beauty of its snowy urban landscape in finely drawn detail.  The story, however, steeped in sentimentality and riddled with coincidence, plays like a third-rate Dickens melodrama, minus the richness of character and subtlety of wit the Master would have brought to the task.  The three main characters aren't particularly interesting, and the story, such as it is, is tedious, unfocused and rambling.  I guess there has to be a reason for a story to be done in animated form, but \\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" fails to provide us with that reason.  The backgrounds are pretty, but the film itself is instantly forgettable.
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|This is simply the worst movie I have ever seen. And I am not alone. When I saw this the week it opened - to a full theatre - nearly everyone in the room laughed at Sean Penn's fake crying and TERRIBLE acting. This film is fumbly, immature, and just plain boring. I found it disinteresting and sloppy. The end is nothing short of stupid and confusing. Acting worse than a Star Wars film, and a thin - if at all present - storyline. Watch the cemetary scene where the entire camera crew is visible in the reflection of the headstones. Just plain amature backyard moviemaking. I fell asleep at one point and left the theatre wanting my money back. (I only gave it one star because Amazon requires at least one.)
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I've had time to digest this album. First off, the album as a whole is worth the purchase. Songs like &quot;Diary&quot;, &quot;Dragon Days&quot;, and &quot;If I Was Your Woman&quot; are some of the albums gems. While songs like &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;, and &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot; will join tracks from her last album like &quot;Fallen&quot;, as a staple of her unique sound. The more she matures, ventures out into different things, she will quickly develope a style, where music fans can say &quot;That's Alicia&quot;!<br /><br /> My gripe are with the first three full tracks. They just didn't work. Other than that, great follow up!
0553573403|5.0|I have been spoiled by this book, and by the subsequent books that have come out in this series.<br /><br />I am now completely unable to read a fantasy book without comparing its level of quality with that of A Song of Ice and Fire, and, sadly enough, very few compare at all.<br /><br />Everything about this series rings true: the characters, the complicated plot, the prose, the action, the dialogue.<br /><br />For those readers who are looking for a 'light' read, do not pick up this book. I can understand that sometimes a heavy epic is just too much, especially after having finished another (I know how it is to try and read ANYTHING after flogging through the tenth Robert Jordan). But if you are looking for epic fantasy that is not simply 'good v. evil' or 'hero who knows nothing about the world, yet ends up saving it,' please give this book a try.<br /><br />The characters are fully fleshed, with actual personalities. They are not 'good' or 'evil' but a little of both within themselves. There is no such thing as an 'invincible' character. All these characters are human, with human needs, thoughts, desires, lives, and decisions to make.<br /><br />The plot is not convoluted; it is complex. There is a difference. And it is not a lighthearted fantasy. There is darkness and evil here that has nothing to do with magic, but is instead related to the pitfalls of the human nature.<br /><br />Please, please, if you wish Robert Jordan would wrap the hell up, if you love Robin Hobb and thought that Terry Brooks' first book was a disaster of hackneyed prose and ripped-off characters -- please, please try this book. It is well worth your while.
0425179877|5.0|I thought Gene Kranz did a fine job of re-living the space race from Mercury to Apollo. His remarks and recall put you right in the control center and his accounts of some of the more interesting moments make you appreciate everything that test pilots and astronauts went through in those early years. If you have want a great account of the space program, the early years, this is the book you won't be able to put down.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I love this cast recording. Kristin Chenoweth is amazingly talented and I love Idina Menzel just as much. The only bad part about this were the Wizard songs. I'm not such a big fan of Joel Gray in this musical and his songs were mediocre.
B000096I9G|5.0|just when you think the cure have &quot;lost it&quot;, they come back with this unparalleled display of artistry.  <br />  <br /> the sound quality is crystal clear, surpassing the original recording of pornography even. the visuals are great, some interesting camerawork but nothing too over the top. <br />  <br /> robert is in fine voice and the band sound great together. my personal favorite parts are the pornography set and the encore (the kiss is particularly stunning).  <br />  <br /> although it only contains material from 4 of their 13 albums, this is by far the best cure performance video out there. highly recommended to die-hard cure fans and lovers of live music. do yourself a favor and pick this up. trust me, you will not be disappointed!
0452282152|4.0|I find it difficult to review the book without also reviewing the movie, so I will review both and try to compare and contrast the two.      The story is about Griet, the daughter of a Dutch tilemaker and his wife in Delft, Holland, early 17th century. Griet's father is blinded when his kiln explodes, leaving him unable to support his family. Griet is hired out as a maid to the family of the painter Johannes Vermeer. She becomes the object of attention of the painter, as well as of his wealthy and lecherous patron. That's the storyline that is common to both book and movie.      First, the book. Chevalier's prose is nearly perfect, expertly supplying detailed setting descriptions that guide the reader into the beauty of everyday life that often goes unnoticed because of its ubiquity, &quot;hidden in plain sight.&quot; Common objects become &quot;objects d'art&quot;. The complicated personal interactions between the well-to-do and the poor, family and outsider, servant and served, artisan and patron are all meticulously treated and never boring. The hook(s) in each chapter are well relieved and easy to ascertain. This is not to say that the book lacks subtlety, for the lavish descriptions could easily have become distracting from the important action were it not for the author's skill in separating the wheat from the chaff. From a readability standpoint, the story is seamless and intriguing.      Now, for the movie. The movie is a visual feast. If you've ever viewed Vermeer's paintings, you will think that the movie is the paintings magically set in motion. The colors are rich and textured, and the action of many of the scenes are shot through door frames and windows, providing acute visual focus. The cinemagraphic emphasis is on contrast, just as Vermeer's paintings emphasize contrast. The dialogue is sparse, and much of the communication to the audience is via facial expressions and body language of the superb cast of actors. This is simply a great movie.      However. . .the movie diverges dramatically from the book in several particulars. The movie doesn't explain what has happened to Griet's father. The movie doesn't mention Griet's brother and sister, key players in the over-all effect of the book. The movie doesn't end as the book does.      It seems that book and the movie have different goals. The action in the book moves Griet from her simple life to a far more complicated life, eventually placing her at a point of crisis in which she must choose between eight different options (symbolized by a compass painted onto the street in Delft). The movie is about contrast, with the action (in conjuction with the visuals) moving Griet into the ultimate contrast, that of role-reversal. At first, she is taught by Vermeer, and then she teaches him; at first she is dependent upon the Vermeer family, and then the Vermeer family is dependent upon her.       When compared, the story of the movie is far more striking than the story of the book. If the movie's divergences from the book weren't so distracting (namely, the lack of explanation of Greit's father's plight), I would almost prefer the movie over the book. Taken separately, though, the book is better. Taken together, the movie is better. I guess the caveat is, don't see the movie without first reading the book. (I do sort of wonder if the differences are the result of a clever marketing plan to make the public partake of both.)      In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed both book and movie. Both explore the human condition in unique ways, and the rewards of taking in both are well worth spending money on both. I highly recommend.
B000002H97|2.0|This Release is when Metallica decided to leave there true roots and go for the big bucks.  This Album appeals to a much broader crowd.  So much that even the biggest Poison or Kip Winger fan could enjoy it.  Well produced but wimpy & wishy washy compared to any previous Metallica album.

B000001FQ4|5.0|First, a big dunce cap for me. In my review of \\"Fighting\\" I mistakenly said that \\"Fighting\\" was the first Thin Lizzy album to feature both Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham on guitar. I am a moron. They both played on this album. But let me offer some reasons why I may have made the mistake...... <br />1) I haven't listened to \\"Nightlife\\" in probably 15-20 years. (I think I simply like everything this band did, starting with this album). <br />2) The distinctive harmony style guitar lines are not clearly evident on this album. (Although there is plenty of great guitar on it). <br />3) Guitarist Gary Moore also played on this album (responsible for the great work on \\"Still In Love With You\\"). <br />4) This album is probably the most \\"all over the map\\" album the band had done. Lots of string arrangements throughout the album, some funk (\\"Showdown\\"), blues (\\"Still In Love With You\\", \\"Nightlife\\"), rock (\\"Sha La La\\", \\"It's Only Money\\"), ballads (\\"Dear Heart\\", \\"Frankie Carroll\\"), Irish music (\\"Philomena\\", \\"Banshee\\"), and the great pop song \\"She Knows\\".  All in all, everything I would expect from the greatest rock band, but in \\"spades\\".  <br /> <br /> So, as you see, I have plenty of excuses (but am still a moron for not checking my writing before I post it). <br />To me, this is just another great album by what in my opinion is the greatest rock band of them all. They had their missteps, \\"Spinal Tap\\" moments if you will, but these guys had a distinctive look, sound, style, attitude.....they just did anything they wanted musically, and I loved them for it. (For example, who in their right mind follows \\"Sha La la\\" with \\"Dear Heart\\".....lyrics like (from \\"Sha La la\\") <br /> <br />I want your body <br />Not your soul <br />Come on baby <br />Take my jelly roll <br /> <br />..followed by (from \\"Dear Heart\\")... <br /> <br />Man with the golden arm, his face gone pale <br />Taken too much junk, he's gone over the rail <br />Breathes out a sigh and his body wails <br />He's gonnaland in trouble, gonna land in jail <br /> <br /> <br />And the album cover artwork by Jim Fitzpatrick is awesome. (And the back cover photo shot of Phil in white, and the other band mates in black, is just another reason to go get a turntable and hunt down the vinyl copies. Lots of great photos and artwork are contained in the vinyl editions. I also think the vinyl editions sound better than the CD's). <br /> <br />
B00020HEG6|5.0|John Williams does it again this time, but better than ever. This is without a doubt the best Harry Potter soundtrack so far. Just like the third movie installment, the soundtrack also has a change in style, but familiar compositions such as &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot; can still be heard. The music is beautiful and well-orchestrated. One song in particular, &quot;A Window to the Past&quot;, proves that a song doesn't need a complicated score to be beautiful. The soundtrack ends with the last track, &quot;Mischief Managed!&quot;, a medley of all the songs on the soundtrack.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I find it humorous that people in this forum seem to be reviewing their own political positions and purposes rather than going into or after the film itself which is the real state of grace here.  Michael is an excellent documentarian, perhaps the best today, with a more historically bent nod to the Burns brothers (sic) and a few others.  He is a great one because he wakes people up and gets them to display thoughts and emotions, while many of these films just make us grab for some more popcorn, change the channel, or nod off.  And almost all of Moore's films have made us think and feel STRONGLY (Roger and Columbine especially).   <br /> <br />As a documentary junkie I have never seen anything perform the effect that Fahrenheit 911 has and does.  It is the cattle prod for the polarization of America today and seems to be getting more and more defined as we move towards November.  Well so be it.  Whether you are a Bush monger or a Kerry cutie this is a movie that needs to be seen.  You decide for yourself whether its purpose is propaganda, entertainment or to overthrow the world in a nicer way than Dick Cheney (corporate takeover) or even John Edwards (legal eagle) ever thought possible.   <br /> <br />I was so disappointed in a recent New York Daily News or Post cover story (can't remember which but they're pretty much the same, right?) when 911 Tragedy standard bearer Rudy Giuliani (I voted for him) blasted this film, sizzled Moore and went on to say he never saw it.  What!?!?  Siskel and Ebert moment ala Rudy: I loved the film Gene.  I hated it Roger, you're an idiot.  Why?  Don't know, never saw it.  Sounds like my Robin Hood book report in the 4th grade.  Skipped the book, watched the cartoon, wrote a parody (got an A+).   <br /> <br />What is everyone so afraid of?  Changing sides, a firmer position, not having the best hairdo?  Maybe Mr.  Moore should make a documentary about THAT.  But Rudy should stay out of that race for sure.   <br /> <br />-Joshua LelandEvans (bald as well) <br />

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I guess you could call me a theater geek -- I have a bazillion cast recordings, and I worship the ground Sondheim walks on.  I have to say I thoroughly enjoy the music from Wicked, and I think the cast is just amazing.  Idina Menzel, whom I've been a fan of since her Tony-nominated performance as Maureen in RENT, does a fab job and rightly won the Tony this past year.  Kristin is fantastic as always, but Idina most definitely deserved to win!  The show is creative (it's based on Greg Maguire's book of the same name -- also recommended) and is just a lot of fun.  Schwartz isn't always viewed as the best composer, but alas, Wicked is great in its own right, and if you're looking for something to cheer you up, pop Wicked in your cd player!
0553579908|4.0|While one reviewer writes that they don't like that bad things happen to some of the \\"main\\" characters in the book that is one of the reasons I love it!  I get tired of the cookie cutter novels sometimes when you know that the heroine is going to come and save them all but I found out quickly in the first series that Martin is not afraid to shake the norm.  While I am enthralled w/ the story I must admit that at times the sex/violence is a bit gratuitous and that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.  The book/series is one of the better one's I've read!  One thing is I wouldn't recommend it for younger readers because of the content.
006054094X|4.0|Gavin Menzies should be commended for doing such detailed  research and analyses.  From what I understand, he is neither a scholar nor a sinologist but a navy man. He has written an excellent book. <br /> <br />Had the voyages and ship-building continued, China would have been a great maritime(and possibly  colonial) power.  I must say that this book should be a research paper or a Ph.D thesis.  These events are not considered significant in Chinese history and it is doublful if too many people are interested in reading or studying this book
B0002858YS|5.0|This CD proves music has not completely died. Killers' demonstrate to critics that recording labels should still venture to launch a fun product with new artists that is hooky  yet intelligent and it'll generate respectable sales. Thankfully Killers do own a refreshing sound to back up the buzz. Musically, they are exciting. The product re introduces the aspect of having a strong rock guitar mixed up front. Killers may own the magic ingrediant to regenerate sales at North American music outlets. Unlike the current crop of \\"has been\\" musical pop acts currently invading Top 40 airwaves in North America, this band is GOOD. This is one CD that you will not regret purchasing. You'll listen to HOT FUSS possibly until the day you have HOT FLASHES.
B00014TJ7K|4.0|It took George Harrison almost five years between albums to present &quot;Cloud Nine.&quot; But it was time well spent. The original eleven songs on this CD were probably the finest solo material he'd written/recorded since &quot;Living In The Material World.&quot; There was an energy and spirit here; Harrison was obviously feeling rejuvenated. Just listen to &quot;That's What It Takes,&quot; a sly but powerfully optimistic song. Or the enthusiastic slinky leads on &quot;Cloud Nine's&quot; title track (shared with pal Eric Clapton).<br /><br /> The other interesting note was just how comfortable Harrison felt with his Beatle-ness. The delightfully novel &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; and the great video that was made to go along with it probably said more about the Beatles' career than the &quot;Anthology&quot; series did, and only in four minutes. In fact, out of all Harrison's solo albums, &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; was probably the most playful. The romantic &quot;Breath Away From Heaven,&quot; the catchy &quot;gossip! gossip!&quot; chant in &quot;Devil's Radio&quot; and the sublime choice for the Disc's single &quot;Got My Mind Set On You&quot; fit Harrison like a glove.<br /><br /> The reissue emphasizes the loose and cheery feel Harrison and friends Elton John, producer Jeff Lynne, longtime cohort Gary Wright and even a quick guest shot by Ringo brought to these sessions. It's that sense of joy that probably carried Lynne and Harrison into creating the Traveling Wilburys albums (how about a remaster/reissue on those two Out-of-Print CDs?). Some cool pictures are included to spice up the package, though the bonus cuts don't add much. If the years found this one slipping out of your collection, &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; is a worthy release.
6302787300|5.0|Celebrate Italian Heritage Month every October! <br /> <br />Columbus: The Truth <br /> <br />Who was Columbus? <br />Christopher Columbus was born Cristoforo Colombo in Genoa, Italy in 1451. He worked for his father, a wool weaver, until he was 22. Bored and frustrated with his life, he decided to follow his dreams of becoming a sailor. Columbus then began reading geography books, and for the next few years studied The Bible and logs from sea captains, gathering all the information he could about the world. After being dismissed by many and called crazy by friends and family members for wanting to prove that there was more land to be discovered and that land went \\"around\\" the world and didn't \\"flatten\\" to an end, he left Italy for Spain. Columbus prepared a proposal for the King and Queen of Spain stating that he wanted to seek out alternate trading routes in and out of Europe. In reality, he wanted to do so much more and when he got the needed financing for boats and a crew, he was ready to begin his journey.  <br /> <br />What did Columbus do? <br />On October 12, 1492, the 90 crew members of Christopher Columbus's three-ship fleet (The Nina, The Pinta, and The Santa Maria) landed on the Bahama Islands, ending a ten week journey from Europe. The ships also sailed through Cuba and the Florida coast. The small population of inhabitants that Columbus's crew encountered were primarily brutal hunters, wandering across the underdeveloped land, living from hand to mouth and from day to day as modern bums. They had no written language, no agriculture and constantly went to war with other tribes. For this, Columbus called them \\"Indians.\\" Columbus and his crew went ashore in their best clothes, feeling confident on a successful trip and had a huge celebration. They thanked God for allowing them to find the land of opportunity and for having the resources to someday cultivate this land into just that. They rightfully christened and claimed the land \\"The New World.\\" Columbusbrought America to the attention of the civilized world and for this, he should be celebrated as a great hero.  <br /> <br />Why do some people think Columbus was bad? <br />Any account of Columbus being a \\"slave trader\\" or a \\"murderer\\" is greatly incorrect and very off base. While Columbus may have had some slaves, (this was common practice in the 15th century), it is unproven that he was a violent man, and to the contrary he was called very religious by many. Protesters of his discoveries and accomplishments are usually those who classify themselves as \\"Native-Americans,\\" wrongfully equating their own ethnic group with the early tribes that roamed the land Columbus founded. In reality, there is no connection between the modern native Indian culture and the savage animalistic roamers that scattered The New World. To say these early inhabitants rightfully owned the land first would be like saying cave dwellers or even in earlier times, baboons had a claim to it. The same goes for Vikings or any other medieval societies that may have at some point roamed the land years before Columbus claimed it, paving the way for the later foundation of a civilized nation. The fact remains that whomever or whatever may have been on or near the land did nothing to establish any sort of way of life other than horrible tribal wars which abolished much of the surroundings along with other unknown events-possibly natural disasters. The New World was barely livable until Columbus and his men got there. We owe our current American way of life to the early discoveries of the Italian explorers and it isn't far fetched to say that Columbus can be credited for paving the way for today's successful foreign trade practices between European countries and other ports-ironically a second tier issue on his voyage of discovery in 1492 yet so relevant in this era. Ongoing European alliances remain strong among many Americans today and tracing American roots to a family country of origin has become typical in modern years for the purpose of celebrating ethnic backgrounds (this especially holds true for the Italian culture). However, it is a false sense of pride for Native Americans to say that they are owed the credit for the evolution of the Americas. While the \\"native culture\\" is a true ethnic group, such statements about the native claim to the New World again have zero resemblance or connection to the early uncultured tribes whom had no distinction with any established nation or civilization and therefore cannot even be proven to have been in existence. <br /> <br />Is anyone truly a \\"native\\" American? <br />Discussions and protests have occurred in recent years with regards to America's discovery. The majority of the popular vote overwhelmingly agree that America was discovered by Columbus and Italian-Americans especially hold true to their hearts that America was founded by an Italian and named after another. All previous generations come from somewhere and therefore, how can one really be just an American and not an American of some background? Americans might not have a Columbus Day if Christopher Columbus had not been born in Italy. Out of pride for their native son, the Italian population of New York City organized the first celebration of the discovery of America on October 12, 1866. Since 1971, Columbus Day has been celebrated as a federal holiday on the second Monday in October. Perhaps someday it will be a legal national holiday like Christmas. <br /> <br />Why isn't the U.S. called \\"United States of Columbia\\"? <br />Years after Columbus died, sometime in the late 1500's in Germany, a clergyman-scholar named Martin Waldseemuller began work on a contemporary world map. He located logs of another Italian-born explorer, Amerigo Vespucci who died around the same time as Columbus. In the logs, Vespucci claimed that he had discovered The New World months before Columbus. For this, Waldseemuller (who later regretted his decision) hastily named these NewWorld continents the \\"Americas\\" on his map and the name immediately stuck throughout Europe. Vespucci made many voyages in his short life and made many claims in his logs, but to many he is looked at more as a great sailor then for actual discoveries. Because the travels of Columbus are the most well documented to date, we look to Columbus as the first official discoverer of the land and therefore, we celebrate Columbus Day in America. Considering both men were Italian, there is no ill-will between Italian-Americans over the land being called America and quite fittingly in 1792, the city of Washington was officially named the District of Columbia after Columbus and became the capital of the United States. Again, there is no accountability for Native Indians to dispute Vespucci's and Columbus's explorations, and if there was any relevance to the tales of Columbus as being fictitious or exaggerated than there would be no District of Columbia and America would have since be renamed by modern mapmakers as India. <br /> <br />The Columbus-Thanksgiving Connection... <br />By the 16th century (1621 to be exact) long after Columbus's life and death, another group of European explorers known as the Pilgrims-this time hailing from England-decided to set sail to North America on their boat, The Mayflower, for a religious mission. Their motives for the trip were to continue to build up the new territory that Columbus first founded. By this time, the much more sophisticated population of the Native American Indians in America were beginning to flourish. When the English Pilgrims settled in the territory now known as New England in Provincetown, Mass. they celebrated their arrival with the first Thanksgiving feast together with the Natives. It is this later date version of the Native Indians that are the true ancestors of the modern Natives and not those from Columbus's era. Contrary to some beliefs, the Pilgrims and the Indians co-existed together, building up the land and making it as livable as possible. For this, Natives and all ethnic groups in America should celebrate Thanksgiving together. In May 1941, President Roosevelt signed a bill that established the fourth Thursday of November as the national Thanksgiving holiday, which it has been ever since. <br /> <br />The Viking Myth... <br />The Vikings of Scandanavia (the Norway-Sweden area of Europe) may have roamed the land sometime around the year 800. The ancient artifacts and documents located from this era do not give us much to paint a picture with, so proof of their existence is widely argued. Grave sights however, were said to have been discovered containing bodies and weapons such as swords, shields and spears. It is speculated that the Vikings may have traveled the world like the much later European explorers, however they were obviously completely uncivilized (if real at all) and seemed to specialize more in brutal battles as opposed to any significant explorations. Any claims that the Vikings are responsible for discovering America or settling it are totally false. In the modern era, the only remembrance or association to any mythical Viking society is equated to the Minnesota-based football organization. Perhaps the forming of the Minnesota team is a fitting tie-in to the practice of watching football on Thanksgiving.  <br /> <br />The Columbus Counterparts... <br />Marco Polo - One of the first explorers to sail from Europe to Asia in the 1200's. Polo explored China specifically for 17 years, building relations with the Khan of Mongol and creating an empire of business between China and parts of Europe, earning him international acclaim as a political, historical and financial genius. An inspirational idol to Columbus, Vespucci and Cabot. <br /> <br />Amerigo Vespucci - A master ship builder, sailor, writer and artist, born around the same time as Columbus, Vespucci sailed to The New World at least three times and navigated many other missions, most of which are highly unknown. His logs often concentrated on scientific analysis on the sun and the moon as well as religion and culture. It is believed he spent much of his time throughout South America and it is doubtful that he crossed North America prior to Columbus. Of course, his most famous distinction is his first name.  <br /> <br />John Cabot - Born Giovanni Caboto sometime in the 1450's, Cabot moved to England from Italy in 1484 and began to take an interest in navigation and set his sights on discovering \\"new land\\" just like Columbus. However, Cabot did not make his first journey to The New World until 1497, long after Columbus's first trip. He is credited with discovering a shorter distance between Europe and America although his voyage actually took longer because the winds were not as favorable during his travels. His shortcut routes, however were used as the basis for later map creations. <br /> <br />The above report is a compilation of several internet essays written by highly acclaimed researchers of American history and is as fact-based and precise as possible. As with any historical document, certain details may be disputed.

B0001I55OC|1.0|I was so disgusted by this film that almost walked out of my living room! I put one star because that's as low as Amazon goes. This movie get's 0.1 star for being in color. That scores one tenth lower than Battlefield Earth, which only scored higher because it had better use of metal. How does this crap make it theatres? How do awesome books get translated into this crap? Why doesn't Michael Crichton write/review screen plays for movies based on his books? And if he did for this one, why did he shame himself and all his fans this way? Why did Richard Donner direct it? Why didn't they get more money for a Crichton adaptation? I'm upset. I didn't see this movie in the theater, because I heard it was too short and strayed from the book. So later on I rented it to satisfy my curiousity. Oh My God. They simplified the time travel process to 3D faxing...with mirrors! WTF??? No alternate universes? No Quantum foam...quantum foam makes me roam? Where do they get off adding to the plot and dropping key plot points? How dare reviewers compare it to Braveheart? The whole time I was was watching this &quot;film&quot; I couldn't help thinking, they based this movie on the Timeline blurb! It was cookie cutter action dribble. this is something you park your seven year old in front of so you and your girl can get some alone time. They stripped away everything anyone would care about. They should burn every last copy of this F-movie.
0790731452|4.0|Tim Burton's clever satire mocking the overly conservative culture of 1950s and the tons of 'B' science fiction films it generated.  One of his better works performed brillianty by a large cast of stars that includes Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, and Martin Short, to name a few.    The Martians are coming and, despite their silly voices saying otherwise, they're not friendly!  The morbid look of the Martians is actually quite humorous and their destructive bumbling over the Earth hillarious.  What can stop their indestructible hordes?  Nuclear missiles?  Ships? Soldiers?  Only those who love the little known folk art from the Midwest can really know the answer.     Burton's imagination along with the talents of many stars bring the audience a great satirical comedy that will have them laughing all the way to Mars.
B00004XQP4|4.0|I understand that when bands get older, just as a creature, they change, and in this case, Greenday changed in a very peculiar way.  If you look at some of their original albums, like Dookie, or Insomniac, they used simply electric guitars and drums, for the most part.  But then when Nimrod hit (don't get me wrong it is an amazing album), it started using accordians, and trumpets in a few songs, which makes the listener confused as to who they are listening too, but for the most part, Nimrod was a hard album.  Warning stepped it up another notch, by using alot of other instruments, which is fine, and it makes for an original album, but where is the hard punk rock hits that Greenday has released in the past??? Minority was the only track on the album that was somewhat like the original Greenday.  It is a good album, some of the tracks are original, and are still really good, but it doesn't really seem like the old Greenday.  I gave this album 4 stars, because I liked the variety, but as far as Greenday albums go, it should probably be a 3.  I suggest this for anyone that likes alternative or mellow rock, for long-time Greenday fans however, I say stick with the old stuff.
B0000683DH|5.0|A good rule to remember with the Star Trek motion pictures is to watch only the even numbered ones (2, 4, and 6) and avoid the odd numbered ones (1, 3, and 5.) Taken all together, this is the best Star Trek to be released on motion picture. It offers a pleasant recap of unfinished business presented in the original TV series and, it has all the requirements for a great film in terms of direction, script, and cinematography.        The film addresses the uncertain fate of Kahn (Ricardo Montalban) and his minions who first appeared in the original episode titled 'Space Seed.' Kahn is a product of the past when the Earth was embroyled in a eugenic war. Kahn and his followers were banished from Earth and sent to roam empty space in their ship, The Botany Bay, in cryogenic freeze. After running into the Enterprise and coming out of his slumber, Kahn sought to take over Kirk's ship but his plot was foiled: Kahn and his crew were placed on the uninhabited planet of City Alpha 5 to spend the rest of their days in exile. The film starts at a much later period where Federation men accidentally run into Kahn's colony. Kahn escapes and seeks vengeance on Kirk for having abandoned him on a desolate planet. With guile and cruelty, Kahn seizes a new machine that can be transformed into the most destructive weapon the Federation has ever seen. Will Kirk and his crew stop him in time?        Ricardo Montalban is definitely the shining star in this movie. His expressions of rage and obsession are quite impressive. The rest of the cast (Shatner, Kelley, Nimoy, etc.) perform their usual Enterprise routine pretty well. The film has a fast-moving plot with a good script and great special effects. This is truly the gem of all Star Trek motion picture films.
076790592X|4.0|People with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are my heroes. I first read this book several years ago. I re-read it for a very personal reason. One of my jobs as a Nurse Care Manager is to coordinate our ALS Clinic. I am often asked for pertinent reading material, and I always recommend &#34;Tuesdays with Morrie&#34;.<br /><br />Morrie Schwartz is the kind of man we would all want to know. A professor who loves to teach and to learn. A man who has his act together so to speak. A kind, loving man with an approach to life that we learn is very particular and precise for him. He has lived his life according to his own philosophy. Mitch Albom, the author first met Morrie years ago while a student at Brandeis College in Massachusetts, and Morrie became his mentor. They lost touch as people do. Mitch saw Morrie on &#34;Nightline&#34; discussing how to live with ALS. Mitch knew instantly that he needed to see his old mentor again. Mitch was at loose ends, and he needed to reconnect with Morrie. Thus began the Tuesdays with Morrie- 14 of them, to be exact.<br /><br />The Tuesdays spent with Morrie were filled with simple platitudes. How to live the life you really want. Morrie was an expert at this. He had developed a neuromuscular disease<br /><br />called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. There is no cure, and there is no treatment. The plan is to assist people with ALS to live their lives with quality. Almost every person I have met with ALS lives their lives to the fullest. They don't hesitate; they realize they don't have time. This is how Morrie deals with ALS. He lives his life well through his dying. Morrie doesn't dwell on the dying aspect. He has a wonderful support system. He has a family, particularly his wife and friends. He shows his love and gratitude to them on a daily basis. He does not miss a beat. They talk about everything. Morrie does not spout new words of wisdom. He talks about living your life with simplicity and connecting with those you love. Words we should all live by, but in our busy worlds, we tend to forget. Morrie knows what he wants, and he wants to live at home, without all of the complicated, expensive equipment that would keep him breathing. He dies as simply as he lives. He has given his best to Mitch. A lesson for all of us. A simple book full of ways to live your life to the fullest. Who could want for more?<br /><br />Recommended. pris robuld all live by, but in our busy worlds, we tend to forget.

B00002DE0S|5.0|There are far too many excellent recordings of the Chopin concertos to earmark this one as the best.  I would be hard pressed to name a favorite.<br /><br />But this one is different in the sense that the orchestra is much more of a participant than most other recordings.  To be sure, the piano is still the star, but this recording proves that the orchestral part is not merely an accompaniment.  While Chopin will never be known as a brilliant orchestrator, these recordings reveal that he had more of a sense for orchestral color than previously thought.<br /><br />The piano playing is excellent, the orchestra plays with passion, a very good, unique recording.<br /><br />Recommended

0743454529|5.0|MY SISTER'S KEEPER by Jodi Picoult <br />8/5/04 <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult's latest novel, MY SISTER'S KEEPER is one of those page-turners that you will not be able to put down.  A couple learns that their daughter, at age two, has a rare form of cancer.  The only possible chance the toddler has is from a donor, but there is no match for her.  Instead, the couple decides to have another baby, created with specific genetic traits, so that this new baby DOES become the perfect match for the two-year-old. <br /> <br />Thus, starts the life of Anna Fitzgerald, whose main reason for being conceived is to save the life of her older sister, Kate.  Brian and Sara Fitzgerald will do anything to save their daughter, and this is the only way they know how.  While at first the concept sounds very noble, and they are adding another child to the family (there is already an older child, Jesse), as the years go by, the family undergoes a change, and it is not for the better.   <br /> <br />As the children grow older, it is obvious Kate's illness is making a great impact on all of them. Jesse becomes the troubled older son, who gets involved with drugs and crime.  Anna becomes the \\"good\\" child, the one that does her best to keep a smile on her face, and is Kate's best friend.  Because Kate is constantly in and out of hospitals, she is pretty much schooled at home and Anna is her constant companion. <br /> <br />Anna, however, comes to a point in her young life where she is tired of being used to save her sister.  Donating marrow, blood, and whatever else is needed to keep Kate alive, is wearing her down. And psychologically, it's making Anna feel that the only reason she was a part of this family was because of Kate.  Through an action that shocks the entire family and the community, Anna sues her parents for the rights to her own body, and the family is now torn in two. <br /> <br />As with any Jodi Picoult book, the legal system is the highlight of MY SISTER'S KEEPER. Campbell Alexander is the lawyer who is hired by Anna to represent her, and his old childhood sweetheart, Julia Romano, is appointed by the presiding judge to act as Guardian ad Litem for Anna. They reunite after many years of being apart to fight it out and to figure out what needs to be done in the best interest for Anna, a girl who no one has looked out for until now.  It had always been in the best interest for Kate that Anna's body was being used, but now it is up to the legal system to decide whether Anna had rights over her body or not. Did Anna and Kate's parents have the right and power to decide what they can do with Anna's body, since she was a minor? What if they asked her to donate her kidney to Kate, a surgery that is not concerned simple? Did Anna have the right to say no?  <br /> <br />MY SISTER'S KEEPER is full of moral and ethical questions that will have the reader glued to the pages.  The ending is a shocker, and it would be shocking to hear of anyone who did not need to use a hanky by the time they had finished the book.  This has been so far my favorite book by Jodi Picoult.  Highly recommended!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I will start out by saying I was a fan of Unearth before this CD came out.  TSOC was a personal fave, so I was reallly looking forward to this.  When it was released, I immediately got my hands on it, and was MORE than happy with the results.  This is not a generic hardcore album, or a lame cheesy metal album like several bands have put out.  It is a fusion of the best of metal, and the best of hardcore, which creates a sound few other bands are able to acheive.<br /><br />Ken and Buz are quite possibly the best 7-stringers playing out there today.  Listen to Zombie Autopilot...these guys thrash the hell out of the 7-strings in ways that most guitar players would never imagine.  The cool thing is each song has its own flavor.  This Lying World has a really offbeat kind of intro that works amazingly well.  Great Dividers definetely is the big sing-along type song that really gets you going right away.  Perhaps my favorite track, Endless, brings the best of everything all together.<br /><br />Without rambling for too long, this is a great band...period.  Fans of newer hardcore bands will be amazed that a band that uses this kind of style is this talented, and even old-school metalheads will probably raise their horns and salute.  These guys are for real.
B000060P79|5.0|It seems that the only problem that anyone has mentioned was possibly childish lyrics.  I do think that Simple Plan's lyrics are less toned than, say, other Punk bands, but who said that was bad.  The actual musical performance is superb and there is not a SINGLE song that is a filler.  I was immediately taken to all of the songs and their beat more than makes up for any shortage in lyrical content.  Personally I don't believe the lyrics of this CD hinder it in any way, and I think Simple Plan looks like an incredibly promising band.  Personal favorites from this CD are 'I'd Do Anything', 'When I'm With You', and 'God Must Hate Me'.  Love the whole CD.
B000002HGD|4.0|Everything Is Wrong was mostly a album combined with many different and experimented songs.  He goes from melodic piano to hard rock to ambient textures and others.  This album sounds more like something similar to 'Animal Rights' but, Animal Rights was not as great.  My personal favorites were his piano tunes (Hymn, God Moving Over the Face of the Waters, & Everything Is Wrong)...I wish he'd make more tracks like that in his future albums to come.  For those who would prefer to stick with his gool ol' dance tunes, listen to the tracks: Feeling So Real, Everytime You Touch Me, Bring Back My Happiness, and Anthem ('Anthem' is absolutely amazing...I see as a true Moby theme).  He experiments well with these different styles, get this one for the collection!
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I first heard of Muse through the song New Born from Origin of Symmetry (which I have yet to buy). I loved that song and went to the store to buy Origin of Symmetry, but they only had Absolution. I thought, &quot;What the hell?&quot; and bought Absolution. My money was well spent. <br /> &quot;Intro&quot; is 22 seconds of a sample of what sounds like a march and it leads directly into &quot;Apocalypse Please&quot;, which has powerful piano mixed with drums and powerful lyrics and a great sounding electronic keyboard synth mixed in.  <br /> &quot;Time is Running Out&quot;, for a while, was a song I couldn't stop listening to. They have a great drum beat and nice lyrics in it. <br /> &quot;Sing for Absolution&quot; is a song I love singing along to. Ironic, huh?  <br /> &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; is electronic guitar doing its best. I don't even like hard rock and I can't stop listening to the riffs from this song. It's really powerful and, well, cool. <br /> &quot;Falling Away With You&quot; starts with acoustics and leads into more powerful lyrics and drums. A very cool song. <br /> &quot;Interlude&quot; is a bit over a minute and sounds like a muffled electric guitar sample that leads into &quot;Hysteria&quot;, which is another powerful electric guitar song. I like it a lot. <br /> &quot;Blackout&quot; might not be for everyone. I like it because it's more elegant sounding than the other songs. Also a great song to sing along to. <br /> &quot;Butterflies & Hurricanes&quot; is amazing! This is my favorite song on the CD. It has synths and guitars and drums and powerful lyrics and even some classical piano. It's a great song. <br /> &quot;The Small Print&quot; is the one track I can do without. It sounds so generic compared to the rest of what Muse can do. And, generic sounding rock doesn't cut it for me. <br /> &quot;Endlessly&quot; is a cool love song. It almost sounds like Moby had a part in making it, but Muse still puts their touch on it.  <br /> &quot;Thoughts of a Dying Atheist&quot; is also a generic sounding song, yet better than &quot;The Small Print.&quot; I like it because of some of the lyrics. <br /> &quot;Ruled by Secrecy&quot; is a slower song like &quot;Blackout&quot;, yet very good. It flows nicely. <br />  <br /> All in all, this CD is great, and I can't stop listening to it in my car.
B000148KK2|3.0|This is obviously a new direction for Diana Krall, writing her own stuff (with help) about personal events. For the most part its a successful venture, but not without some missteps in my opinion.  <br />  <br /> Her choices in which songs to reinterpret is first rate at times. I'm Pulling Through, Black Crow and Love Me Like a Man are wonderful choices and the best cuts on the album. The first showcases Krall's particular talent for torch songs. The third demonstrates Krall's ability to swing and let loose and is alot of fun. It would be nice to hear more of this type of song from Diana Krall. Black Crow is an excellent rendition of the Joni Mitchell tune. There's alot of great instrumentation and Krall's vocal delivery is excellent. Stop This World is another first rate choice.  <br />  <br /> If you like both Tom Waits and Diana Krall, you should love Temptation. I despise Tom Waits, so this track is not a particular favorite of mine, but its well done. Almost Blue is just plain boring for this listener. I love the slower tunes by Diana as much as the next person, but this one just doesn't move me. I'm not a fan of Elvis Costello at all, so perhaps that's the problem.  <br />  <br /> Which leads me to the original material written by Krall and husband Costello. Largely, its good, if a little too slow and too personal to hold up to repeated listenings. The title track is nice enough, but a little languid in places. Abandoned Masquerade and Narrow Daylight are languid in the extreme. Certainly well done, but just not that interesting. The best of the original songs are I'm Coming Though and Departure Bay. The former is especially enjoyable, with the emotion of the song coming through, and some nice instrumentation, especially near the end. Departure Bay is similar, but much more explicit in its personal references to Krall's home area. The only problem with these songs are that they are all slower numbers and maybe so personal that they might leave some listeners abit cold and unable to relate. As much as I like Departure Bay, I don't see myself listening to it very often, and the same can be said of most of the other originals. They are nice songs, very professional, but not very interesting. <br />  <br /> Diana Krall's next album should make for an interesting discovery. She'll obviously continue to write original material, but how much? How far will she move away from what's gotten her to this point (masterful interpretations of standards and other artists' songs)? Will the Elvis Costello influence become too much? Here's hoping the last question is definitely not true. This listener would like to see a few more upbeat tracks, with a good amount of romantic ballads. <br />  <br /> The first three tracks I mentioned make this a worthy purchase all by themselves. They are that good and demonstrate Krall's strengths to the fullest. The rest of the material is mixed as far as enjoyment. However, there is not a &quot;bad&quot; song on the album. It's just that the tempo and the mournful personal nature of the songs keep things from getting overly excited or interesting.
B000274THQ|5.0|Good Bye Lenin! is one of the best movies to come out of Germany in the past few years.  The film displays brilliantly the many conflicts of interest which gripped the German people during the events of 1989 and 1990.  Actors Katrin Sa and Daniel Brhl perform wonderfully as mother and son.  Alex's(Daniel Brhl)desperate attempts to keep his ailing mother, who is a staunch communist, from finding out that her beloved GDR is no more border on absurd, but it is this absurdity that makes his actions so poignant, and at times downright comical. <br />The film's seriousness and black humor balance each other out, giving the viewer an intimate look inside the newly dynamic world of the former east Germans.   <br />I recommend this film to anyone, regardless of one's cinematographic tastes. Its truly a remarkable film that will be remembered as one of the greats in German cinematography.
B000001FA4|5.0|All bands that grow from small underground followings to pan-galactic stardom seem to have distinctive &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; periods in their recording history, and Irish rock gods U2 are no exception. For the first half of the 1980's they were staples of college radio, a time when it really MEANT something to be big on college rotations. They had a small but extremely dedicated fanbase and were telegenic (well, Bono was, mullet and all) enough to make the video rotation on MTV, especially after the concert taped at Red Rocks theatre in Colorado, one of the best shows I've ever seen (and one I'd really like to see re-released on DVD.<br /><br /> Then &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; came out in 1987 and they became mainstream rock stars playing in stadiums on tour and being mentioned in TV shows like &quot;thirtysomething&quot;. Then came &quot;Rattle & Hum&quot; and they've been trying to sound like everyone else but themselves ever since.<br /><br /> But &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, now 20 years old, was the last album they made that still had the same raw and vital energy they had from when they formed during punk's dying gasps. The Edge was still one of the most distinctive (and I honestly believe the last truly innovative) guitarists on the music scene. Larry Mullen Jr.'s savage chops showed that he could keep up with any drum machine programmer; Adam Clayton's bassplaying has never been equalled either in the mix or stylistically speaking on any other U2 album. And of course Bono's voice was just amazing...truly versatile, monumentally inspiring on some tracks while utterly heartbreaking on others.<br /><br /> The album hits the ground running with &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot; (unbelievably the only lyrics printed on the liner notes), shifts gears to the arena-friendly &quot;Pride (in the Name of Love)&quot;, the monumental hit single that set the stage for their mainstream success (and became overplayed to the point that I sometimes forget to tingle inside when I hear it today...most unfortunate for me; it's still a great song), then upshifts yet again to my favorite track &quot;Wire&quot;, an exercise in kineticism with a laid-back growl rising to a searing howl played over a frenzied rhythym; great contrast.<br /><br /> &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; brings things down a bit, but some of Bono's finest singing is displayed here. The string arrangement may have been a bit over the top, but...it still works. &quot;Promenade&quot; and &quot;4th of July&quot; may be throw-aways, but they still add to the feel of the record. They fit the overall mood of the album. &quot;Bad&quot; is a crescendo-build-up that fits the same mood as &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, and &quot;Indian Summer Sky&quot; fits hand-in-glove with &quot;Wire&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;Elvis Presley and America&quot; I've never fully understood, but it is the only track featuring a droning acoustic guitar and the compressed effect (with Mullen's staccato drumming) give the song (to me, at least) more of a Hindustani feel, which I dig. &quot;MLK&quot; closes the album out on a very Eno-esque mellow note; it may not be remembered as one of U2's best tracks, but it should be remembered that they also chose to perform that song during their halftime appearance at Super Bowl XXXVI, which was the NFL championship game following 9/11. The roll of the dead from that day's events was displayed as a backdrop; obviously the song meant more for U2 in 2001 than it may have even in 1984.<br /><br /> Remembering that this album was initially designed to be a 2-sided LP or cassette tape should give the listener even more appreciation for the degree of balance demonstrated when comparing the first five tracks with tracks 6-10. Overall it's a terrific album, and the last time U2 recorded an album where they sounded like U2, which is to say they sounded like no one else before them or no one else since. Buy it at once.e when I hear it today...most unfortunate for me; it's still a great song), then upshifts yet again to my favorite track &quot;Wire&quot;, an exercise in kineticism with a laid-back growl rising to a searing howl played over a frenzied rhythym; great contrast.      &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; brings things down a bit, but some of Bono's finest singing is displayed here.

B00006F7S4|5.0|This is Beck's biggest breakthrough/re-invention to date.  I would think that I would stop saying this after every album, but somehow he manages to pull this off each album.  We saw a taste of this in Mutations, but this modern day amalgamation of funk/pop/rock/techno and whatever else he wants to be has consistently delivered.  Simply great, in the top 5 musical artists in the States and this album the best to date.
B00029NMRM|4.0|this was a great movie, however i think it's high time that Warner brought out DVDs in cases comparable to other distributors.  i think the cardboard case is absolutely terrible.  Movie was great, features were good, packaging was cheap and very nasty.  get with the program Warner, we consumers want total quality with our products and packaging, not rubbish that looks like the back of a cerial packet.
B00000JRTX|2.0|The film was tedious and dry. Zero chemistry between McDowell and Grant. An uninteresting disappointment, the film was disengaging and nearly vapid. A few comical moments couldn't save this bore.

B0001Z37HM|4.0|Maybe you have to be in the right mood to enjoy this movie, and it certainly helps to have low expectations going into it. Still, there's something about it that's kind of cute and endearing. The acting sucks, the dialogue is bizarre (&quot;I have fought 177 men; only one is still alive...and he has no legs!&quot;), and the plot is not very important to anyone in the movie, but the set design and costume design are totally insane. The design of the movie drifts in and out of real and imagined historical periods, and every scene uncovers another bizarre, oversized piece of scenery or headgear. The chemistry between the actors is also kind of sweet, especially the young prince (Ernie Reyes, Jr, who would later play the kung-fu Yanomamo Indian leader in The Rundown with The Rock) and his man-at-arms/father figure. For some reason this movie's lack of grounding in reality suckers you in and helps you accept the strange campiness of it all. Especially cute is a prolonged sword fight scene between Arnold and Brigitte Nielson that ends with them falling down exhausted. Now if only they had cigarettes. Give this movie a shot, at least you can learn where Arnold's misogynistic butt-slapping ways came from.
0553382179|5.0|EVERYTHING about my life, outlook and attitude has changed in the 2 years I have followed FLYLady's system. If you have access to a computer on a regular basis - you should really sign up for her daily emails at [...] flylady.net  While her tone may put some people off at first (it did me), and some of her essays and ideas may seem a little out there, there is absolutely NO doubt that her system works and works well.  BUT - you have to do her 'assignments' and follow her directions - don't leave things out.  I have a way of doing that myself, picking and choosing what sounds good or right to me and leaving the rest out.  You will not get the same results if you do that. If you step out in complete faith and do what she says, however weird it may seem at the time, it will all come together and make sense soon enough. This woman will make your life easier and more peaceful for you than you can imagine now.  I just can't say enough good things!!
B0002EXH4A|5.0|I love this album, damn the critics and fellow reviewers. Dave did the best he could while he still had a little bit of blood in his heroin stream. A new drummer and new guitarist will give you a different sound too.<br /><br />Into the Lungs of Hell is a great little opening. Never did figure out what guitar effects those were. From there we get Set the World Afire. Sure it's a little dated to hear mutants ruling the streets in the year 1999. But then again Einstein will prove to be right Someday.<br /><br />Anarchy in the UK? I love this version. I think Dave sounded great and the backup vocals threw it over the edge, a GREAT choice of covers IMO.<br /><br />Mary Jane? I had the T-shirt with the decapitated doll on the back. Not a bad song, but not my favorite. 502 falls in with Mary Jane, it's there and it's part of the album, but nothing special. The album really picks up with In my Darkest Hour. Some of Dave's best songwriting ever. I'd put this song up against anything else in the Megadeth arsonal. I could never hear James Hetfield sing this. I'm glad there was a Megadeth.<br /><br />To those who don't like LIAR. Are you crazy? This song is a juggernaut. The rambling vocal part is a metal highlight of the 80's. Hook in Mouth is good if you remember the times. If you were to be taken seriously with the kids, you HAD to write a song attacking the PMRC. You just had to.
B00009V7RF|4.0|...I say great. Some people are against the addition of Fergie, but I believe she is a &quot;rockin&quot; addition to an already &quot;jammin&quot; group. Her voice is fresh and spicy and gives a little flavor (so to speak) to the songs. <br />  <br /> 1. Hands Up- Very original beat & instumental back-ups. Not my favorite, but a good song nonetheless. 3/5 <br />  <br /> 2. Labor Day (Its a holiday)- Perfect weekend song!!! Song to dance or bob your head to! 4/5 <br />  <br /> 3. Let's Get Retarded- Even though the radio changed it to &quot;Let's get it started&quot; , its still great either way. Great to dance to. Even my dad likes this one!! (And he's old!) 5/5 <br />  <br /> 4. Hey Mama- ABSOLUTLEY WONDERFUL!! It just makes me want to dance and clap my hands. Great music video too! This is my favorite on the disc. 5/5 <br />  <br /> 5. Shut Up- Its ok, I guess. The middle of the song is where it becomes decent. I usually skip this one. 3/5 <br />  <br /> 6. Smells Like Funk- This is a great song, although it gets stuck in your head really easily. Hilarious lyrics and great beats equal a song to remember! 5/5 <br />  <br /> 7. Latin Girls- Very unique and fun song. I turn this one up. Obviously from the title, it has a hispanic flavor! 5/5 <br />  <br /> 8. Sexy- A little bit slower. Very funny analogies. 3/5 <br />  <br /> 9. Fly Away- Pretty much Fergie's song, but good. A little bit poppier than the rest of the songs 4/5 <br />  <br /> 10. Boogie That Be- Very funky song! I love the chours..you just have to snap your fingers. 5/5 <br />  <br /> 11. APL Song- Very real and sad. It makes you appreciate what you have. Its just too sad for me...3/5 <br />  <br /> 12. Anxiety- A mix of rock and rap and it's pure genius! 5/5 <br />  <br /> 13. Where Is the Love?- First single off this album. Slightly annoying because of Justin Timberlake, but very real and catchy. 3/5 <br />  <br /> So overall its a great Cd, and I would reccomend it to anyone. So to all you Fergie-haters, BOO! <br />

B00003CXCT|1.0|I took the time to calculate the true average of the reviews here after reading Skullchrist's review below dated August 4, 2004. It is actually very easy and takes no time (you just have to show all the 1 star reviews, then 2 star, etc.). Anyway, here's the breakdown: <br />  <br /> 1 star reviews: 183, 2 star reviews: 36, 3 star reviews: 67, 4 star reviews: 78, 5 star reviews: 498. Total number: 862. <br />  <br /> Calculation: (1*183)+(2*36)+(3*67)+(4*78)+(5*498)=3258.  <br />  <br /> 3258/862 = 3.779582366... <br />  <br /> I'm giving it one star because I too would like the option of having the original and the &quot;special editions&quot; in one set. After this review the average would be: <br />  <br /> 3259/863 = 3.7763615295... <br />  <br /> So, 4 out of 5 is just about right, Skullchrist; no rating manipulations. <br />
B00005Q4CS|5.0|if you have ever thought about doing drugs, done drugs, or knows someone that does drugs, you must see this movie. especially if you're in high school, because most of them are the most face level people in the world, and this would completely warp their views on reality. i saw this movie thinking that the story of the 3 friends would disturb me beyond expectations, but it was really ellen byrnstyns(spelled it wrong) performance taht disturbed me, and amazed me the most. i know someone who ended up like her in the movie, which is why i couldn't help but cry at the end. but although this movie is particularly based around drugs, the real story here is about losing all hope in life. when the movie starts, it is summer, and these kids are getting high for fun, and selling their drugs to get money, and they achieve that. then it becomes fall, things start getting a little worse for them. they lose most of their money, and honestly become helpless junkies, craving a fix. by this time, byrnstyns character has become addicted to diet pills, and becomes increasingly schizophrenic, and paranoid. by the time it becomes winter, hope is completely lost. in the last 20 minutes of the movie, you're completely stunned, and horribly disturbed, and completely devastaed at what has happened to these 4 individuals. it's truly a shocking ending, and one of the saddest things i've ever seen. i've seen 2 movies in my whole life that have disturbed me (the other being pink floyds the wall) but this one far exceded the level of horror and disturbance of that one. when the film has ended, you don't want to move, you don't want to eat, you don't want to talk, you basically sit in your chair for about 15-20 minutes afterwards, just thinking about this movie, and the horrors surrounding it. this is no afterschool special, or anti drug add, this is real, and this is what drugs will do to you.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|&quot;Mystic River&quot; is the kind of film you don't see much anymore. A powerful film that uses textured, mature acting and a story that cuts at its characters as its probes its own plot. Director Clint Eastwood is may bot be the most flashiest filmmaker out there, but his style feels as if it has evolved with experience and trial and error. Each shot looks and feels as if it has been set up by a skilled master of the game, and one who knows how to handle the story of &quot;Mystic River,&quot; adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane. <br />  <br /> Three friends from urban Boston (a dynamic acting trio of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon) share a history. One that involves kidnapping and sexual abuse. As adults they have drifted apart, but when Jimmy's (Penn) daughter is discovered murdered, they come back together again as Sean (Bacon) is the cop assigned to the case Dave (Robbins) slowly becomes the prime suspect. Surprisingly, there is a lot of ground to cover, detailing Jimmys' chekered past as well as Dave dealing with his own wicked experience as a boy. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland (L.A.Confidential) does so with a clarity and even-handedness that proves invaluable. No major plot detail goes without being explained, and in a way that doesn't distract from the main murder mystery. <br />  <br /> Eastwoods' supporting cast is equally stellar as the three leads. Marcia Gay Harden is haunting as Dave's wife, exuding subtle terror and fear that preludes the film's tragic two-pronged climax. Laura Linney has but a small part as Jimmey's wife but she makes an impact in the parade scene that ends the movie. The one real surprise of the film is Laurence Fishburne. For all of us who thought he was the walking dead in the ill-advised &quot;Matrix&quot; sequels, here he is a sly, humorous partner for Bacon, as well as being a great foil for the star in the scenes they share. Eastwood, however, makes the film. His style, though workmanlike, is masterful. He knowshow to use the actors at his disposal and when he is at his best, he knows how to make a story deeply emotionally resonant, especially here with Helgeland's shrewd script. &quot;Mystic River&quot; is a film that you may not see often anymore, but it's one to be remembered.
B00004Z459|1.0|Over the past few years, Linkin Park's songs have had constant radio play.  I never liked the way they sounded, plus I couldn't really tell the difference between one of their songs and another.  My friend said that if you just listen to the radio you're going to think that but the albums are very diverse.  So he lent me Hybrid Theory.  Surprise surprise when it was more of the same.  I wasn't able to tell when one song ended and the other began.  With the Screaming, Rapping, DJ Scratches and a singer that sounded like he was straight out of a boy band it got me wondering what happened to Mainstream hard rock.  Bands like AC/DC, Guns 'n Roses, The Motley Crue and Led Zeppelin.  Without the accompaniment of advanced recording methods and by being fun instead of having angst-ridden lyrics they made beautiful music.  Unless you liked the manufactured angst-ridden sound of modern hard rock, I suggest you start looking into the classics.
B00023GGFI|5.0|I am a novice when it comes to the blues. I picked up this disc somewhat on a whim after hearing a small clip online and i'm glad I did. This disc is amazing. I don't know what blew me away more, the vocals or the guitar playing. I can't decide on which is best. All I know is that I enjoy this disc very much.
B000002H97|3.0|Metallica's 5th album is held in high regard but there are some moments on the album that really hinder it froming getting a higher score. The first half of the album is awesome - It's great commericial metal. That in itself, might be a slight oxymoron but the music is enjoyable. After the 5th track, the cd begins to dip in quality. Nothing else Matters and Struggle within are great, though. Metallica first's albums are great, but this one does have some serious low points. It does fill like a collection of singles and filler. Yet, the good music is solid enough to stand on its own. If you can look past the reputation this cd has then you may be able to enjoy it more.
038551123X|4.0|\\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" is a uniquely, creative twist on the murder-mystery genre. Having just finished this book a mere few moments ago, I'm still thinking about it. I'm not sure whether I am to root for Dexter or be appalled. Dexter himself is an enigma wrapped in a riddle. For all outwards appearances he is a relatively good guy, excellent at his work. His outside hobbies though, are far from average. He singles out the unjust that warrant death and give them that reward. For example, Dexter finally brings a priest who murders small children to task. He is methodical, careful and borderline psychopathic.<br /><br />When Dexter encounters another who seems to share the same bloodlust that he does, it compels him to discover this person. The last couple of chapters left me oddly happy that Dexter and perhaps Brian and Deborah may make another return. This is a darkly odd book. I liked it because it wasn't a cookie cutter whodunit. It was a strange exploration into the dark psyche of an everyday individual. It may make me rethink my co-workers just a bit J.  My only complaint is the supporting characters. Stiff, and wooden, they did not assist the story as much as detract from it. I wanted more flesh to Deborah, to Brian and even to Dexter himself.
B000002GA8|1.0|Con 17 aos (en 1977) compr este disco y me pareci una obra maestra. Wakeman era el mago de los teclados y de la composicin. Poda codearse de t a t con cualquier compositor clsico que se preciara. !Qu ingenuo!. Haca lustros que no escuchaba este disco. El otro da lo adquir en Cd y corr a recuperar esas maravillosas melodas. El resultado fu una frustracin como hay pocas. Durante todos estos aos he escuchado bastante msica clsica. La suficiente como para darme cuenta de que Wakeman es tan slo un mal aprendiz de brujo. Es un correcto teclista, muy vistoso visualmente, pero poco ms. Compositivamente, esta obra es absolutamente vacua, pueril y grandilocuente. En el marco de Yes, Wakeman cumple su papel con mucha correccin. Es un buen teclista para la media de lo que son los teclistas en el rock, pero fuera de ellos, sus intentos por convertirse en algo ms resultan patticos.
B00005KARK|5.0|I bought this for my three year old and I was amazed at how much I had forgotten about the film. It is a beautiful film. The artwork of those days was so geourgeous. It's like watching a full length feature of moving portraits. I know the graphical Disney movies today are much brighter and colorful , but something about those old water painted cells is more appealing to me.  <br />Anyway, Dumbo is a wonderful tale of dealing with the grief of being ostracized. Dumbo is a classic protagonist who deals with so much that it is very hard for even an adult to hold back their tears at the end of the movie. People keep complaining about the Pink Elephant scene and the Crowes. Well, it is a fact of life that people drink and this could be used to educate a child. The Crowes are stereotyped of course, but yes most black people did talk that way back then. The point of the whole Crowes scene is too show that African Americans can relate to Dumbo better than anyone because they too had also been mistreated in society. It is in no way makeing fun of African American society. I don't understand this world. Anytime a scene is shown from early American Southern History everyone is in an uproar. This was our history and roots culture folks.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|I read the books after seeing the movie, and discovered how Weir had hacked away bits of O'Brian's novels and patched them together to make this movie. The books are wonderful and deserved better translation into several movies, instead of just one. Some of the, ahem, screen writing took huge liberties with the books, completely changing the fates of characters, locations, enemies and more. When I read the books, I'd find the movie bits taken from several stories and time periods. A writer's worst nightmare. Despite that, I thought Russell Crowe a wonderful Jack Aubrey, as well as the actors playing Pulling, Killick, etc. The actors playing Maturin and Bonden were miscast. Despite the hash Weir and company made of the script, I still want to watch it over and over, and keep reading the books. If you reaaally want to find out about what happened to Hollom, read the real &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;. Murder, intrigue, and tension abound...

1400031087|5.0|I read a lot, and I'll readily admit it was hard to adapt to this book's stylistic format: a lack of quotation marks for dialogue, the capitilization of certain words for impact, etc.  However, after overcoming/adapting to these literary obstacles, this book had me in its grip until the very end.  This is one of the most compelling stories I've ever had the pleasure to read.  This book is a must-read for anyone recovering from addictions of any sort.  There were many stretches that I couldn't put the book down, I had to see what happened next.  I only hope they get Gene Hackman to play the role of Leonard should there be a film adaptation.
B00005JKN9|1.0|Stink Bomb: Martin, how could you? <br /> <br />Daniel Day Lewis gives a riveting, fascinating, over-the-top performance, one of his finest. Unfortunately it is in this stink bomb of a movie. Rarely have I waited and anticipated a film to this level and rarely have I been so bitterly disappointed.  <br /> <br />Visually stunning the film is marred - and mired - by the leaden protagonist of Leonardo di Caprio. I can see why directors want him as he is a capable actor when given the right role.  In the wrong role he's less than adequate (and do people really find him THAT good looking? I don't get it.) Here, di Caprio's hero is a somnambulist, barely awake, barely able to go through the motions. I wanted to hold a mirror up to his mouth to see if he was actually alive. The only acting job I can think of worse then this in a major director's big budget mess was Sophia Coppola's in God Father III. But even she wasn't intended to carry the film as di Caprio is here.  <br /> <br />Cameron Diaz gives one of the worst performances of the year - she almost looks as though she knows she's being wasted. <br /> <br />Daniel Day Lewis deserved a better vehicle. Perhaps with today's technology his performance can be excised and dropped into something else? <br /> <br />One of the year's worst. <br /> <br />p.
B000002UAO|5.0|Prior to the release of this album, the Beatles was the BEST band in the world head and shoulders above everybody else. With the release of this album, they simply left everybody (already) in the dust.<br /><br /> Want to know how good these guys were..??<br /><br /> In the fall of 1965, the Beatles had to get to work to in order to have an album available for the upcoming Christmas season. Since their first album in mid 1963, the Beatles had spoiled us with two albums a year and their record company insisted on a Christmas release.<br /><br /> And so in October of 1965, they entered the studio and in the span of about 4 to 5 weeks, they had written and recorded a dozen new songs.<br /><br /> However, this feat becomes all the more remarkable when you look at the album and see songs like &quot;In My Life&quot;, &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;.<br /><br /> This album also contained new sounds / instruments (sitar, fuzz bass) that would become more and more prominent as the Beatles moved forward with Revolver and the landmark Sgt Pepper's album. With their tourning days now behind them, the Beatles no longer had to record songs that they could &quot;duplicate&quot; on stage in front of a live audience. Now, with George martin and Geoff Emerrick manning the control room, the Beatles could now flex their &quot;studio muscles&quot; and go for the sound that they heard in their heads.<br /><br /> If Revolver and Sgt Peppers' were LSD-influenced efforts (think about Tomorrow Never Knows, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, She Said She Said, etc), the Beatles were clearly under the influence of copious amounts of grass with this album. In fact, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, who listened to this album repeatedly while enjoying a joint was so inspired and influenced by the new sounds he was hearing that he would go on to record his greatest album Pet Sounds.<br /><br /> Norwegian Wood is a clever and well veiled song about an affair that John Lennon had had with a prominent English journalist. However, its primary claim to fame - other than being a beautiful crafted song - is that it is was the first rock / pop song where the listener heard this new instrument - the sitar.<br /><br /> In My Life is an incredibly beautiful song and, in my opinion, represented a major turning point for John Lennon as a songwriter. Although there's no question that Lennon was a brilliant songwriter even on the early Beatles album, this autobiographical effort took his craft to a whole other level. John is looking back at people (Pete Shotton / Stuart Sutcliffe - &quot;some are dead and some are living - his best mates) and places (later Strawberry Fields would arise from his memories). I hear this song and I can certainly hear the influence that Bob Dylan must have had on John during this period. Clearly John was becoming less and less &quot;comfortable&quot; writing about imaginary girlfriends and love and focussing more on his own personal experiences.<br /><br /> Nowhere Man clearly falls into this category as well. John has stated that in the song, he is the Nowhere Man. It's hard to believe that a man who was the leader of the world's most influential band, idolized by millions and enjoying a bank account that was growing by the minute could think of himself as a Nowhere man crying out for &quot;Help&quot;, but such was the nature of this genius, John Lennon.<br /><br /> This is a great album which provided further proof that in terms of artistic / musical creativity, the Beatles had no limits.<br /><br /> Nobody then or even now has done it better than these four guys..!!bout an affair that John Lennon had had with a prominent English journalist.

0767817478|2.0|Apart from the criticisms coming from the countless Kaiju (giant monsters typically made of cheese)fans this movie does have many problems in general. <br />The plot is relatively simple and one of the biggest flaws of this movie. French H-bomb mutates an iguana into a giant bipedal lizard. Shortly afterward this lizard buys a one way ticket to New York, where he steps on cars and upsets many people. He/she lays eggs and then gives new Yorkers a problem more serious than Mayor Bloomberg: thousands of little mutates iguanas (who look kind of like little Allosauruses and act like Oviraptors(I was sick of everyone comparing them to velociraptors).  <br />Now, why did this giant mutant iguana who was spawned in the pacific ocean go straight to New York? The classic Godzilla always went straight to Tokyo or Osaka but that was just a matter of geographic convienience. How did the giant mutant iguana fit into the New York subway? Well people have asked this question so I will ask a better one. Why did the giant mutant iguana travel inside of the subways? How did Godzilla have enough body-mass to lay those thousands of eggs? How did he/she fit into the parts of the stadium where he laid the eggs?  <br />All of this would be ok in an original series Godzilla movie or lets say a Gamera movie from the 60s, but in a Hollywood high-budget movie these stupid little things are not acceptable. Escpecially because this movie wanted to eliminate some of the campy aura from the word Godzilla. It failed and the old Godzilla became ressurected in 2000. I would suggest those movies over this one any day. <br />Furthermore I would suggest a name for this movie that would make it a whole lot better: Giant Killer Mutant Iguanas in the Big Apple. Calling it Godzilla is just a misnomer.
B000002UB3|5.0|When the Beatles recorded their White Album, it was apparent that &quot;cracks&quot; were developing within the band.<br /><br /> When Abbey Road was being recorded, these &quot;cracks&quot; were now chasms as wide as the Grand Canyon. Which makes this incredible finale all the more remarkable.<br /><br /> At the time, for example, Apple was losing money at an astonishing rate (John was quoted as saying that at the current pace, they would be broke in X number of months). In addition, John, George and Ringo were aligned against Paul in wanting to retain Alan Klein as their business affairs manager while Paul wanted his new father-in-law Eastman to take over the management role which had not been filled since the death of Brian Epstein.<br /><br /> And these factors, coupled with the fact that for 6 or 7 years, the Beatles were these God-like figures for an entire generation and you can easily understand how world-weary they had become. In the late summer of 1969, when this album was released, the Beatles were a long way from the cute mop tops who shook their heads and sang &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah only 6 years earlier.<br /><br /> After the completion of Let It Be, which many felt would be the swan song for this remarkable band, it came as quite a surprise to George martin, the Beatles producer, when Paul approached him and asked if he would like to produce another album for the Beatles.<br /><br /> I think George Martin agreed to produce this album on the condition that it would be done like it had been done years earlier when the Beatles were a band. I suspect George Martin had become very disillusioned with the Beatles efforts on the White Album when it was becoming painfully apparent that the album was more the work of four guys working independantly as opposed to four guys working together as a band.<br /><br /> Notwithstanding all of the above, their problems were not apparent on this album. It's as if they collectively decided that if this was to be their last effort (and when you listen to them talking years after the breakup, there never was any formal acknowledgement at the time that this would be their final album), then they were going to go out on a high note. Only the Beatles could put aside all of their differences and focus their energies on producing something as great as this album.<br /><br /> In fact, when you listen to this album, they never sounded tighter and more together as a band. Unfortunately, and I hate to dispel any illusions anybody might have, this wasn't the case. The Beatles were rarely together in the studio at the same time. And the &quot;structure&quot; of the album apopeared to be a comprimise that was reached between John and Paul. The A side, which consisted of individual songs was John's preference while the B side of individual songs skillfully weaved together was Paul's brainchild.<br /><br /> Again, in common with other Beatles albums, my personal favorites on this splendid effort are John's contributions - Come Together, I Want You, etc.<br /><br /> However , George also contributed two of his finest efforts on this lp - Something ( atribute to his wife Patti) and Here Comes The Sun, an incredibly optimistic and &quot;feel good&quot; song inspired while George was sitting in Eric Clapton's backyard during a beautiful spring day in England.<br /><br /> It's hard to believe that only about 6 years separated Abbey Road from the first lp. It went by so fast and despite a wealth of great material, I could easily have listened to these guys as the Beatles for another 25 years.<br /><br /> These guys were the best - NOBODY will ever come close to them..!!as to be their last effort (and when you listen to them talking years after the breakup, there never was any formal acknowledgement at the time that this would be their final album), then they were going to go out on a high note.

B000063DGC|5.0|I Love this CD Rhandy Rhoads is in my opinion the best guitar player Ozzy ever had. There is only a few songs left out that should have been on here(Ive never heard Diary of a Madman live)Overall I think this is one of Ozzys best. His Voice is perfectly clear on this one, much better than live at budakon were he is older and the words arent as clear.
B000002UAR|5.0|Sandwiched between Rubber Soul and the incredible duo of the Beatles single &quot;Strawberry Fields / Penny Lane&quot; and the album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Revolver is considered by many to be the Beatles finest effort and collection of songs.<br /><br /> When you listen to this album, they certainly make a compelling argument.<br /><br /> In 2004, it's possible for uninformed listeners to hear this album and think &quot;so what's the big deal..??&quot;.<br /><br /> However, in 1966, this album burst forth with creative ideas crafted in the studio that had never been done before. It was a groundbreaking landmark album that would culminate with Sgt Pepper a year later. The album contained Tibetian Book of The Dead, LSD-inspired images, a child-like sing-a-long song, backward guitars, tape loops of strange sounds, etc. And some of the most imaginative and sophisticated lyrics that pop /rock had ever heard before.<br /><br /> The album also showed the tremendous and growing creative / musical differences that existed between John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Look at John' contributions to this album - &quot;She Said, She Said&quot; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; and &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; and compare them to &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; and you can clearly see the widening gulf that existed between John (who was literally eating LSD at the time) and Paul.<br /><br /> I think this is a great album and just provides additional confirmation that the Beatles were continually moving forward creatively. I've always been a huge fan of John Lennon - more than any of the other Beatles - and this album contains some of my favorite songs by John. And it always blows my mind to listen to a great song (by John..!!)like &quot;And My Bird Can Sing&quot; and hear John refer to it as a &quot;horror&quot; and a &quot;throwaway&quot;.<br /><br /> Just another great work by the best band the world has ever known..!work by the best band the world has ever known..! <br />  <br />
B000000OSE|5.0|This CD I think has many more great songs than UYI2, Songs like november rain dont cry bad obsession and coma make this one better, the otherone is very close though both classics. any GNR is worth buying.
B0000029DD|5.0|The first time I ever heard Jeff Buckley was at a friend's house, listening to some &quot;classic rock&quot; station. &quot;Hallelujah&quot; came on, and by the end of the song, I was moved to tears by the hauntingly beautiful vocals and guitar of the song. Prompted by the love of Hallelujah, I decided to do a little research on Jeff Buckley, and when I heard the whole tragic story, I cried again. Immediately after that, I went out and bought &quot;Grace&quot;. The whole album is breathtaking, and the best album I have ever heard. There is a wondeful cover of &quot;Lilac Wine&quot; by Nina Simone, and the choir-like &quot;Corpus Christi Carol&quot; which is amazing because of the range of his voice. It is truly sad that we have lost an artist like Jeff Buckley, and he will certainly never be duplicated or rivaled by any other musician. If only he could have lived longer, his full potential could be shown.
B00024BHTC|1.0|I am dissappointed with this album.  It sounds the same as their previous releases and the whole charade of symphonic metal is getting tedious and boring.
B00006V9A0|1.0|&quot;Not fans of Punk&quot;?! Sorry guy, but I love all forms of Punk except the watered-down wanna-be &quot;Punk&quot; of Nirvana. Nirvana was a bar band, pure and simple. Bar bands aren't out to change the world, they're out to get drunk and shoot up with their drug of choice. Nothing about Kurt Cobain was innovative, creative, or relevant. He was not a smart man. He never questioned anything in any of his songs. He never raised any ideas about social consciousness or sensitivity. And no, his song &quot;Rape Me&quot; cannot be considered a social conscience. That is one of the most insensitive songs I've ever heard. So what if he called it &quot;anti-rape&quot;. Just because he says it doesn't make it so. Kurt Cobain even played it as the opening song at an Anti-Rape benefit. Just imagine if you were one of those victims. If I were one of them, I'd be outraged, saddened, and sickened that someone would be so ignorant that they'd play that. What a good way to open up some old wounds for an audience full of victims, Kurt. Want real Punk? Try Public Image Ltd, The Denver Mexicans, The Kinks, Coffin Break, Adam Ant, Siouxsie & the Banshees, and Atari Teenage Riot. Since you haven't, shut your mouth. What you think is Punk is nothing more than what the media tells you is Punk. Real Punk shouldn't adhere to any standards. Punk should not always be low-fi. It can have synths, horns, or whatever the hell a band wants it to have. The spirit of Punk can be found in Country music, New Wave, Dance music, but never Pop music fed to the masses like Nirvana. It should blur the lines of genres and have no boundaries. Punk is about a message, not about a sneer and a certain sh*tty sound. Nirvana tried to emulate the sound of Punk, but failed at getting any relevant message across. Tell me, how can &quot;A mulatto, an Albino/ A mosquito, my libido&quot; mean anything to you?
B000286S8S|1.0|Some people may like the new tracks, but from reading these reviews a hell of alot don't.  You can't force people to like summit just because YOU do!  This album is nothing special and thats that.
B0000035E7|2.0|Don't let any review sway you. Just listen to the music and make up your own mind. I personally think that Bleach is just as worthless as In Utero, but that's my opinion. Narrow-minded fans who pledge allegiance to anything (especially a charismatic frontman like Cobain) don't like it when you disagree with them, no matter how valid a case you make. Such is the story with most fans of Nirvana. Fans of this band need to stop pitying themseles and learn that nobody's going to love them until they love themselves (I don't care how cheesy it sounds; it's true). They also need to stop getting offended by everyone who hates their favorite band. Apparently, Nirvana fans here don't think I'm entitled to my own opinion if it conflicts with theirs, but they need to wake up and learn that conflict is what makes the world go 'round. Creating constructive conflict is what meaningful Punk is all about. Nirvana were only concerned with creating controversy for controversy's sake. Nothing attached tot the &quot;Nirvana&quot; name had any real message to get across. I always hated how vague and meaningless Kurt Cobain's lyrics were. And then he has the audacity to say his band makes Punk Rock music. For some amazing digital hardcore Punk Rock, I suggest Atari Teenage Riot's &quot;Delete Yourself&quot; and &quot;Burn!, Berlin, Burn!&quot;. It samples Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and the Sex Pistols' &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; and then uses it as a full-frontal assault on your ears! ATR will shred your speakers and your ears, and will probably lose yourself a few friends, but it's all worth it when you experience digital hardcore for the first time. I say we need to destroy popular culture and create an honest one. <br />  <br /> Nirvana's Bleach: 2.5 out of 5 (mediocre)
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This excellent DVD combines two of my favorite things, anime and Daft Punk. It's basically a silent anime movie, with the soundtrack (which is the main draw of the movie) being done by French electronica band Daft Punk. The story is basic, an evil man from Earth comes to a distant planet, and kidnaps the blue-skinned musical group so that he can conquer the universe. Odd plot, but it moves quickly and fluidly. The art is beautiful, and the songs are great. The story is very good, as well.<br /><br />The special features? A little mini-booklet that comes with the DVD. It has some art, and little extras like that. The movie itself has some making off segments and such, and scene selection, but they aren't labelled at all, making things somewhat confusing.<br /><br />This movie is quite excellent, and if you like anime, electronica music, or Daft Punk, I'd highly recommend looking into it.
B000003TAR|2.0|I shouldn't let my opinion of Kurt Cobain cloud my review of his music, but it's a little hard to do when his music served the same purpose as he lived to do: to create controversy. And no, Nirvana fans, you can't twist that into &quot;creating art&quot; because art isn't synonymous with controversy. Art should be about honest self-expression, not the cold and calculated alienation of people who love you. Even for what it is, the music on here is not good. All of Kurt's attempts at being Punk are throwaways. &quot;RFUS&quot;, &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot;, &quot;Milk It&quot;, &quot;Frances Farmer&quot;, and especially &quot;Tourettes&quot; aren't &quot;challenging&quot;, they are musically-challenged. And someone such as Cobain was not afraid to get out of bed in the morning (the call of the needle is what got him out of bed). Cobain relished the attention he got (that's why he was a performer), and he egged people on when he didn't get the attention he wanted (i.e., he purposely ticked people off to get a reaction he wanted). The guy kissed his bassist on SNL, and the kicker is that he just did it to &quot;p*ss the homophobes off&quot;. Kurt didn't want to show the normalcy of being gay, he just used it to create controversy. How Punk. All bullsh*t, and no social consciousness or sensitivity. Kurt Cobain confused creating controversy with starting a revolution of positive force. Tell me, what is half the worth of a suicidal junkie who used music as a hobby to occupy himself until he got sick of life and killed himself? That isn't a rhetorical question. The only way I'd be proud of my kid is if they were their own individual. I'd cry if if my kid turned out to be a Cobain clone like so many of today's youth are. The kid would be a f*cking sloth with no will to live for godsakes. Why would anyone want their kid to aspire to be half of what Kurt Cobain was when aspiring to be their own unique person is the best and only thing a parent can realistically expect?
B00000583F|2.0|First: This sounds like the noise my friends and I used to make in our pre-teens on an old Silvertone guitar before any of us learned how to play.  Like Sleep, we were trying to sound like Black Sabbath but relied on distortion for most of the appeal.  I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing; it just really reminds me of the make-it-up-as-you-go-along thing we were doing in our basement. <br /> <br />Second: This is why a singer like Ozzie Osbourne or Robert Plant is worth his weight in Platinum.  Everytime a guitar riff catches my ear, my next thought is that I can't wait to hear what the vocalist did with it, how he played off of it or along with it.  With Sleep, it is understandable why the singing is sparse -- it is inevitably a disappointment.  It's a great waste of attitude.  Though I don't think the lead singer has the pipes to pull off any great vocals, it would be nice if the current crop of metal bands didn't possess such a fear of melody.  <br /> <br />Still, I appreciate the effort.  At least there are a few brave souls out there who are still trying to rock.  Yo, yo.
0780626494|5.0|&quot;Blast from the Past&quot; is one of my hands-down favorite movies. It's charming, cute, sweet, and genuinely funny. Brendan Frasier and Alicia Silverstone are (surprisingly enough) perfectly matched as Adam and Eve (the movie contains only one joke about their names). <br />  <br /> Basically, Adam has spent his entire life in a very elaborate bomb shelter. His parents had just sealed themselves in their bomb shelter after a &quot;news scare,&quot; and when a plane crashed on top of the shelter, they assumed that a nuclear war had finally been launched. The doors wouldn't unlock for 35 years (because that's when the radiation would be done - or at least that's what Christopher Walken said). Fast forward 35 years, the doors unlock, and Adam gets the chance to see the world outside. When he gets lost and can't find his way back to the bomb shelter, he fortunately stumbles across Eve, who helps him adjust to life in the 90s, as well as purchase supplies to take back to his parents. <br />  <br /> The DVD release is pretty minimal, unfortunately. There is a movie trailer and a pretty lame game called the Love-Meter or something similar. Pretty skimpy, although the visuals are quite nice. It's a great movie, although if you are buying the DVD version, buy it for the movie and not for any extras, because there aren't any. It does contain both a widescreen and fullscreen version, however, and the disc is NOT two-sided.
B000000ORX|5.0|Much is made of an album's \\"accesibility\\", and for Joni this can be significant, as I've found some of her albums inacessable.  Night Ride Home was for me her most accessable album; as well as her best.  Limited publicity for the album though has left many not knowing of it.<br /><br />  There's not much that can be said for such a moving album. From the first time I listened to this album earlier this year, I was hooked. The writing is passionate and intense and the music is the same. Written more than 20 years after her first album, this proved that there was no slowing down in the creative process. I stil haven't heard all of Joni's albums, but from the 6 or so I have heard, this takes the cake. You can't beat most of the songs on this album!  Court and Spark has 2nd place right now for me.<br /><br /> There are only 2 or 3 \\"misses\\"; on this album, but the thing is that the rest of the album is so incredible that those 2 or 3 songs don't even make a dent--hence the 5 star rating I gave it.<br /><br /> On my list of the greatest albums of the 20th century, this album without a doubt makes it onto the list. Joni's not limited by decades or radio. She may put out some less than satisfactory music now and then, but over the course of her career has deserved that right I guess. This album ranks among the reasons why she is indispensible to musical history, and present day discussions.
B00005JN2X|5.0|Fans of &quot;Heat&quot; should not miss &quot;Collateral,&quot; a terrific thriller starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Foxx plays a mild-mannered cab driver who has no idea that a normal-seeming fare is going to give him the ride of his life. The less you know about the plot the better, so i'll just mention that the cast is outstanding, the pacing is excellent, and there's surprising humor as well. In fact, at one point I found myself hoping that the movie was going to be as long as &quot;Heat&quot; (it wasn't) because I was enjoying it so much.
B00024BHTC|5.0|First of all my top 5 bands in descending order are #5 - Stiff Little Fingers, #4 - Rammstein, #3 - Muse, #2 - Metallica, #1 - R.A.T.M. I've been to T in the Park three times, Glastonbury once and the Reading Festival twice (I'm British by the way). Anyhow the point I'm trying to make is that I take my music seriously. With this in mind I proclaim 'Dark Chest of Wonders' to be (perhaps) the best symph-rock song that I have ever heard and 'Once' (with the exception of 'Master of Puppets' & 'Origin of Symmetry')the best album.     Nightwish are THE most popular band in the whole of Europe right now, and on the evidence of this album I can hear why. Honestly, every song on this album is a gem. Just hearing Tarja Turunen's voice soar above the rythmic explosion of the drums and guitar riffs is mind/eardrum-blowing. I haven't seen them live yet, but (and I'm adding this because it's important for a band to be able to perform live and well) as a quote from Kerrang Magazine (Britain's #1 rock mag') puts it:      \\"As the spine-tingling intro to 'Dark Chest of Wonders' fills the room and Empuu Vuorinen lets rip with one of his trademark pomp-laden riffs, the secret to this band's success becomes obvious... Tarja Turunen seems more like an opera singer gatecrashing a metal gig than a die-hard headbanger with a gift for soaring vibrato. Nonetheless, she is a commanding presence as she blows dust from the rafters with her astonishing vocal range and dazzles the first few rows of fans with her spectacular cheekbones.\\"      (This guy puts it better than I ever could.)      Anyone who loves bobbin' their head or trying to bust the subwoofers on their sound system will rejoice when they hear the first couple of tracks on this album (it gets better with every listen). You really should buy it. But if you don't then it's definetely your loss.
B00000I8BX|5.0|As an avid fan of techno as well as metal/hardcore, i must say that this album brings the best of both worlds. Intelligent samples, smashing grooves, and punishing lyrics make this album thoroughly enjoyable. The musicianship is top-notch (in comparison to some of today's othe metal acts). The guitarist, while choosing to eschew solos, does a superb job in laying down an unforgettable anthem. The bassist and drummer add the best grooves lines of any hardcore band i have ever heard. Lastly the vocalist tries, and succeeds, in blending an agressive and heavy verse with a startling original and unique chorus. A must have album for any true metal enthusiast.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is arguably the most horrific and shocking American film I have ever seen. It is brutal, honest, and sadly depressing, and I didn't expect anything more when I first saw it. Saying that &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is over-the-top and exaggerated is like saying that an orange isn't a fruit. It is not exaggerated, but instead a fast-edited, well-directed masterpiece directed by Darren Aronofsky. The story concerns a lady named Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) who lives in Coney Island and is sometimes visited by her junkie son Harry (Jared Leto). She subscribes to diet pills after being selected as a guest on her favorite TV show. However, her addiction to the pills gets stronger as her son, his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans) all become victims of drugs.  <br />  <br /> Burstyn gives probably her best performance to date, same for Leto and Connelly in a very good performance. Wayans gives his first dramatic role and possibly also his best. Darren Aronofsky gives an outstanding direction, the editing is wonderful, and the music is one of the best movie themes I have heard in a while. Very powerful and horrific, &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is one of the 50 best films of all time. If &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; can't teach you to stay out of the influence of drugs, then what can?
B000002HMH|3.0|This album, is actually pretty good. But it's nothing compared to the Kill `Em All to ...And Justice For All days.<br /><br />OK, a couple of the songs go on for too long, and there were a few songs that weren't that good, so I had to take away 1.5 stars. Here's a run-down of the songs:<br /><br />1. Ain't My B****-7/10-A OK song, it's not on of the best, but not the worst song either.<br /><br />2. 2 X 4-8/10-Good song<br /><br />3. House Jack Built-8/10-An O.K. sonh as well.<br /><br />4. Until It Sleeps-9/10-I love this song.<br /><br />5. King Nothing-9/10-I like the chorus. Very good song.<br /><br />6. Hero of the Day-9/10-See 'Until It Sleeps'.<br /><br />7. Bleeding Me-7/10-Long song.<br /><br />8. Cure-7/10-Another ok song.<br /><br />9. Poor Twisted Me-8/10-See above^<br /><br />10. Wasting My Hate-8/10-See above^<br /><br />11. Mama Said-5/10-I don't like country, that's why it's a 5.<br /><br />12. Thorn Within-7/10-An OK song.<br /><br />13. Ronnie-7/10-I usually skip this song.<br /><br />14. The Outlaw Torn-20/10-AWESOME! This album would be a 5-star album if every other song were good as this! It's also the best song on the album, and my favorite song!<br /><br />Bottom Line: It's definately not a masterpiece, but it's a pretty good album.<br /><br />I'm done here.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have not been a Slipknot fan before.  I just dismissed them as a gimmick band.  After buying this CD, I am now a fan!  I've heard other Slipknot songs and liked them, but not enough to buy a CD.  Them I listened to the samples on this page and ordered the CD without delay.  More musical then the last CD, but just as hard.  They are letting the music be the focus now, not the masks.  Very good CD, BUY IT!!!
0307155102|5.0|I bought this book after my son fell in love with &quot;Cars and Trucks and Things that Go&quot;. He loved it but not as much. A few of the pages here that just teach words and don't show a detailed landscape scene aren't as interesting to my 21 month old. But still, he's learning words and shapes and colors here. We've got spiders and police cars down, thanks to Richard Scarry. I can see this one being a book my son will enjoy for a while as he starts to learn his alphabet and to count. My son enjoyed this one enough to motivate me to start collecting all the R.S. books for him. This book is hardcover with paper pages. Watch out because little hands can rip those pages quickly.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I bought this album after hearing Interpol for the first time at the Curiosa festival a couple of weeks ago. Their sound is a mixture of The Doors, The Clash, and grunge style all in one which is amazing ! Memories of my reaction Pearl Jam's debut album &quot;Ten&quot; resurface when listening to this album.  <br />  <br /> Watch out for this band. They have HUGE potential ! Can't wait 'til the follow-up album is released at the end of September ! <br />
0786852550|4.0|The best part of it is the djinn. I read it very fast to get to those parts.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I liked Ashton Kutcher in his &quot;Punk'd&quot; series, but not so much in his other shows. In this film, though, he really shows a wide range of acting. The story pulls you in and twists you up. It is not a generic copy of any other films, although it could be a mix of a bunch of them (think &quot;Dreamscape&quot;, &quot;Flatliners&quot;, &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;Sliders&quot; and even &quot;Blair Witch&quot;). It may not be a horror film, but it is suspenseful enough to almost be that way (kinda like &quot;Seven&quot;).
B00000DLUV|5.0|After watching that concert through the DVD &quot;One Night Only&quot;, I noticed the difference between that kind of music and nowadays music. I'm 25 years old and I like this kind of music (also actual music, of course). Bee Gees is one of the greatest music groups of history. <br /> After many years, Barry Gibb still has that voice which identify him in songs like: &quot;Stayin' Alive&quot;, &quot;Tow Much Heaven&quot;, &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;. All of them are performed greatly on this CD. I really like that nice two-in-one for &quot;Night Fever&quot; & &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; and that intro with &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot; (it also for the closure of the show). <br /> Production of this record is also great because the sound of attendance is not so high to fog the main attraction (voice and music). Robbin Gibb performs the classic &quot;I Started A Joke&quot;, &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;, &quot;Massachussets&quot;, etc. <br /> I strongly recommend this CD not only for its priceless quality, but like a tribute to Maurice Gibb. Think that after his dead, it will never be the same.
B000002I8D|4.0|One never knows what to expect when an artist releases a solo album when he has had a successful tenure with an established band. Such was the case when Phil Collins released &quot;Face Value&quot; in 1981. It usually is a case of hit or miss. In the case of miss, often the artist will just continue with the established band. In the case of hit, many times it means leaving the established band. There are some cases where the solo artist has maintained a duel career as a solo artist and band member. This would be the formula that Phil Collins would follow over the next decade. Phil Collins was now entering a third decade as a member of the band Genesis. In the mid 1970s, when lead singer Peter Gabriel departed Genesis, drummer Phil Collins would replace him as lead singer. Collins was now beginning to catapult Genesis to more and more commercial success. Genesis was continuing to grow in popularity by the beginning of the 1980s when Collins released &quot;Face Value&quot;. In this case (and on many of his solo albums), it provided an outlet for Phil Collins to explore avenues of music beyond the progressive rock sound that Genesis had so finely tuned. <br />  <br /> Collins has three avenues on this particular album. The first one is that he introduces brass horns on many of the tracks - this is something that would become a staple of Phil Collins' career in the 1980s. As you listen to the brass horns, you actually will see some simularities to the sound of Earth, Wind, and Fire. In fact, the EWF horns (from the EWF band) are used on the Beatles remake &quot;Tommorow Never Knows&quot; In addition to Brass horns, there are many other tracks that introduce a String element (Violin, Cello, etc). The second avenue that Collins goes down is what I term a &quot;dark psychedelic&quot; element. The best way I can describe this is this is the kind of music you might hear on a quiet, dark city street - with a touch of psychedelica. A lot of this avenue can be traced back to his days with Genesis. The third avenue overlaps the other two avenues - Phil Collins powerful and haunting drums can be heard across many of the tracks on this collection. <br />  <br /> The Brass Element comes into play on the third track of the album. &quot;Behind the Lines&quot; is a song that Genesis did on the &quot;Duke&quot; album (and later on the &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; album). In general, Phil Collins and Genesis have had an unwritten pact not to overlap the the group's catalog with the solo catalog. So it is very rare Genesis will do a Phil Collins solo song and vice versa. In this case, since Collins was launching his solo career as a compliment to Genesis, it probably didn't hurt. This is the only remake of a Genesis song Collins would ever do on his solo albums. On Collins' version of &quot;Behind the Lines&quot;, it adds a completely new dimension to a legendary song - mainly because of the horns and a more upbeat tempo. <br />  <br /> &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; has become a staple to open Phil Collins' concerts up in the 1990s. For the most part it is an instrumental with basically a choir element going &quot;nah nah nah nah nah nah&quot;. It is a pretty unorthodox opening song to a concert and it is just as unorthodox on this album - however this is on terrific song. The instrumentals on this song feature the horns and some haunting drums by Phil Collins himself. Other horn influenced songs include :&quot;I Missed Again&quot; - which was a Top 20 hit, &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; - a very underrated and often forgotten song in the Phil Collins portfolio, and the Beatles remake &quot;Tommorow Never Knows&quot; The ballad &quot;If Leaving Me is Easy&quot; doesn't have trumpets or trombones, but it does have a nice saxaphone element to open the song.  <br />  <br /> The &quot;dark psychedelic&quot; element is heard on several tracks as well. The most obvious is the legendary Phil Collins track, &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; ( there also is a nice violin that is included as well). The &quot;Roof is Leaking&quot; is a very quiet song, but has some pretty powerful lyrics - probably the most &quot;serious&quot; of all the songs. It features some Banjo and a slide guitar. &quot;Droned&quot; is another instrumental. &quot;Droned&quot; almost sounds like a preamble to &quot;Hand in Hand&quot;. It would have been nice if they actually had a better segue between the 2 songs. The piano based song &quot;You Know What I Mean&quot; - while less on the psychedlic side still may fall a bit on the dark side. Finally, Collins remake of &quot;Tommorow Never Knows&quot; while having a horn element - also falls on this dark side. The instrumentals are terrific, but Collins voice sounds a little to distorted to me. <br />  <br /> A couple of songs that give us a preview for what Collins will do over the next decade are &quot;This Must Be Love&quot; and &quot;I'm Not Moving&quot;. &quot;This Must Be Love&quot; has a sound you will hear on many of the Collins love ballads he would do over the next 3 albums. &quot;I'm Not Moving&quot; - with touches of psychedelica brings that happy, upbeat Phil Collins sound that also would be a staple of his career over the next decade.  <br />  <br /> The liner notes are terrific with full production credits. All of the lyrics are included except the Genesis song &quot;Behind the Lines&quot; and Beatles song &quot;Tommorow Never Knows&quot;. This album is a more dark album than the albums that follow, but it is a very good effort and really compliments the Genesis work well. It's a shame that many of the songs on this album are ignored by Collins in concert and on his greatest hits collection. This collection has a lot to offer and should is recommended for any fans with an interest in Phil Collins.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|For those who find this album \\"impenetrable\\" or \\"difficult\\" following the more musically accessible The Wall, I would recommend listening to this in a dark room with headphones, and unplug the phone. This intensely personal document from Roger Waters is unbelievable in its impact when you listen to it like a movie, letting it conjure images in your mind. The absolutely withering view of the waste of war as seen from a son who misses his father almost unbearably is incredible in its emotional impact. Roger must be tempted at times to update the lyrics so he could add Bush and Saddam in the name-checking! Also, in a funny way, this was the most \\"punk\\" thing to come out of England in the early 80's - the anger and honesty here is real, more real than you ever got from flameouts like the Sex Pistols. The bonus track is fine, but not essential, but it doesn't hurt the flow that the original album had either.  This 2004 remaster sounds amazing, and the album is friggin' brilliant. Check it out.
B00000I14Z|5.0|This is truly a jazz masterpiece and a timeless classic. The selections on this CD combine incredible musicianship with the genius of Mingus' compositions and the results are stunning. Every track has a unique feel with the music gleefully incorporating elements of gospel, blues and other influences while retaining a hard bop sensibility. John Handy is wonderful on sax and his performance really stands out although the entire band is excellent. This is jazz that is accessible to the general listener as well as challenging to the serious jazz lover. If you are just getting into the music from this period you can't go wrong here. Buy it and enjoy.
B00008EY65|4.0|Although far from a perfect film, Hellboy is way above average for the typical CGI/Action Thriller that we've all come to know and love (or be dissapointed by) ever since Terminator 2 hit the screens over ten years ago.<br /><br /> I'll forgo the typical storyline review as you can read it elsewhere.<br /><br /> Everything that is worthwhile in Hellboy begins and ends with Ron Perlman. After 20 years of being a supporting actor who was best known as the &quot;Beast&quot; from the tv show &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, Perlman finally gets a lead role in a major motion picture and his performance is first rate. Particularly the quiet scenes involving Hellboy and Liz, his fiery would-be girlfriend and Jeffery Tambor as Hellboy's droll boss. The so-called &quot;Thank You&quot; scene between these two actors is drop dead perfect.<br /><br /> The supporting cast does it's job well although Selma Blair as Liz is saddled with a rather sad character and she never seems to come to life.<br /><br /> The DVD extras are particularly good, especially the DVD commentary featuring the four leads. They are both funny and informative, serving as a model for what DVD commentary should be. When Ron Perlman says that he waited &quot;53 years to kiss the girl&quot;, it'll almost bring a tear to your eye.<br /><br /> If you're a fan of the film, but not really a Hellboy nut, then I'd say purchase this DVD. Otherwise, you should wait for the &quot;Expanded Hellboy&quot; DVD which is due out later this year.<br /><br /> Ken
B00005QCYC|3.0|The original is the only good film. Forget the set and buy it on HDVD when it comes out in 18 months. Does anyone know the condition of the original film? This film will likely be re-mastered to 1080p and isn't Jurassic Park all about the big screen? Incidentally the effects didn't get better as the trilogy lost its novelty.        That's my two cents (so now you have $1.06 if you read these things in chronological order).
0345350499|5.0|I read Mists of Avalon quite a while a ago and still I cannot forget the enchanting nature of the book. It is an incredibly quick read for a novel over 1000 pages and the reader can't help but be engrossed in the imaginative re-telling of Morgaine, Arthur, Lancelot, Morguese and the many other memorable characters of the legend of Camelot and King Arthur. <br /> <br />I do not believe it reads like a typical science fiction/fantasy book. In a way, it almost reads like a historical fiction novel, that is steeped in the histories of the peoples of early Britian and the chaotic struggle between the pagan religions and the new Christian one that was occuring during the time period in which the book is set.  <br /> <br />Morgaine is certainly the heroine in this rendition of the story of Camelot, and a strong one at that. She struggles throughout the book over her ancestry, her destiny and her future. Bradley portrays her in such a way that now whenever I read a novel on King Arthur or see a movie on the legend I cannot believe that Morgaine was ever evil.  <br /> <br />This book will change the way you view and think about the legend of King Arthur. It is a must read for anyone!!
B0000640SA|5.0|<br /> Don't read the following if you haven't seen the movie.  <br />  <br /> Leonard himself kills his own wife. His wife survives the intruders assault. Leonard kills one of them before he loses his memory. The second intruder is killed latter with the help of Teddy. Teddy shows him a picture where Leonard, covered in blood, is pointing at his chest where he would tatoo that he killed the second intruder. Somewhere at the end of movie, as Leonard drives around in a frenzy of mental activity, we see a rushed glimpse of him relaxing in bed with his wife -- with the legend &quot;I'VE DONE IT&quot; tattooed on his chest (exactly where he was pointing in the picture).  <br />  <br /> In other words, his wife was still alive AFTER he killed the second intruder.  <br />  <br /> In the last scene of the movie, Teddy explains to Leonard that he has manipulated Leonard to kill Jimmy and possibly several other similarly loathsome bottom feeders before that. He says something to the effect that it was &quot;to give you something to live for&quot;; of course, Teddy also has to admit that his own motivation had a little bit to do with the $200,000 in drug money stashed in the trunk of Jimmy's Jaguar.  <br />  <br /> Leonard gets angry, and Teddy, apparently frustrated by his lack of memory, hits him hard with some uncomfortable truths: Leonard's wife hadn't even died, Teddy tells Leonard. She actually survived the assault. Leonard himself had killed her, by administering insulin shots. The Sammy Jankis business is a dreamy conflation of a real story with events from Leonard's own marriage, events so horrifying and guilt-causing that Leonard has had to project them onto someone else -- poor, hapless Sammy Jankis. <br />  <br /> As Leonard narrates the conclusion of the Sammy Jankis story, we see an extended shot of poor Sammy in an insane asylum. A figure walks across the front of the camera -- and suddenly, for literally a split second of screen time, we see Leonard himself in Sammy's chair. Similarly, as Teddy berates Leonard at the abandoned building, we see shots of Leonard himself administering insulin to his wife's thigh.  <br />  <br /> Leonard has a copy of a police report, but we are given to understand that some pages are missing. Presumably the missing pages would have included the information that Leonard's wife didn't die in the original attack. But who took the pages? And why? Apparently, Leonard himself took the pages because he wanted to believe that his life has a &quot;mission&quot; to find the killer (even though his wife survived the assault, and he killed his own wife by insulin, i.e. &quot;Sammy Jankis&quot;). <br />  <br /> Teddy's outburst at Leonard in the end answers all the film's questions. But if what Teddy says about Leonard is true, and if Leonard can remember fully his life before the attacks, why doesn't Leonard remember his wife had diabetes? He says flatly that she didn't. But as Leonard himself tells Teddy fairly early on, &quot;Memory's unreliable ... Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police; eyewitness testimony is unreliable ... Memory can change the shape of a room or the color of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.&quot;  <br />  <br /> Did Sammy kill his wife with insulin? Or did Leonard? For Leonard to have killed his wife and then have transferred the story onto Sammy (as Teddy claims) would require that Leonard remember an event that happened after his accident. Yes, Leonard has a quick memory flash of injecting his wife, but it's followed by a repetition of an earlier version of the memory, where he was merely pinching her. Is the injection memory just the other memory distorted by Teddy's suggestion? Except, several hours later in the chronology -- which is to say earlier in the film -- Leonard, sitting at Natalie's house, has another momentary memory flash of preparing the injection. (It appears to be the exact same shot as before.) Even if the image was a false one, influenced by what Teddy said, how can Leonard still remember it hours later?  <br />  <br /> Who ends up in the mental hospital? Leonard tells us that Sammy ends up there. But Teddy tells us that Leonard's nuts, and then there's that flash in which we see Leonard himself there <br />  <br />
1594200106|5.0|It has been a long while since I've read such a beautiful and exciting story. It took me to a place that felt quite new and thrilling. It offered great romance, great suspense and some very dark scenes that seemed right out of a classic horror movie. This is literature at its very best!<br /><br />Daniel has grown up around books. His father owns a bookshop and transferred his love of fiction to his son. On his tenth birthday, he is brought to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, the place where old books that no one remembers are kept safely hidden away. That's where he finds a book called The Shadow of the Wind by a man name Julian Carax. Little does Daniel know that this find will forever change the course of his life.<br /><br />As he grows up, Daniel realises that his book might very well be a curse to him. First, a dark man with burnt skin corners him in a street, demanding to be given the book, the very same man who has been scavanging the four corners of Europe for Carax's books in order to burn them and erase the author's work forever. Daniel quickly becomes enthralled with the mystery behind the man and slowly begans to uncover years upon years of dark, hidden secrets.<br /><br />Daniel also has to cope with his newfound love, Beatriz, his best friend's sister. Their forbidden love will only bring them closer. Helped by his father's employee, Fermin, and Beatriz, Daniel will go on a quest to uncover the life of the great, forgotten author, a quest that will threaten his very life and the ones of the people he loves.<br /><br />This is a novel for anyone who love books. It is a rich story that is often funny, often filled with sorrow. I loved every single character in this story. Every new chapter brought forth a new and unexepected twist to the story. This is truly an original coming-of-age tales that deserves numerous readings.<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is that rare kind of book that sticks with you long after you've finished reading it. I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this one. It truly does have something for everyone.cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this one. It truly does have something for everyone.
B00005JMJG|5.0|It's rather unfair to lump this in the category &quot;romantic comedy.&quot; While very quirky in a way similar to Being John Malkovich, this is an amazingly apt picture of love: a collection of treasured experiences between two people. The film is a collage of scenes which don't really make sense until the final moment. But when it all comes together, the impact is forceful. This film shows the simplicity of love and the subtle power of it which keeps drawing us back. This is an intelligent, brilliant, touching story.<br /><br /> Just FYI: the title is a line from a poem by Alexandre Pope (Eloisa to Abelard) which starts:<br /><br /> In these deep solitudes and awful cells,<br /><br /> Where heav'nly-pensive contemplation dwells,<br /><br /> And ever-musing melancholy reigns;<br /><br /> Which is pretty much where the movie starts with the main character unhappy with her negative feelings about the relationship. So she chooses to wipe her entire memory of it from her mind. But this results not in moving on... just starting over.<br /><br /> How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!<br /><br /> The world forgetting, by the world forgot.<br /><br /> Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!<br /><br /> Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;
B00003CXFG|1.0|On top a Vin Diesil's terrible acting the movie was pointless and irritating. I understand the movie's called pitch black but do u really have to have bad lighting the intire movie. i wish i could have given it half a star!
B0002HTZJI|1.0|How can they put out a live album with this setlist??  Two songs from before Californication and they are Under the Bridge and Give It Away.  Pathetic.  This is the worst setlist possible for such a great funky band before By the Way came out.  By the Way is horrible.  If you want some real Chili Peppers, listen to Blood Sugar and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan.  Uplift album brought the funk and fun together.  You can't get any better than closing an album with Organic Anti-Beat Box Band besides Sr. Psycho Sex.  I just looked and aw that is an import and it will cost you stupid people 22 bucks to buy it.  Have fun listening to this.  I know I won't.
0800177363|5.0|There is one scene I will always remember from Awakenings. It's when Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) sits on a bench at the zoo watching a large cat pace behind the bars, staring out at him but unable, of course, to leave its confinement. All it does is pace. And in a voiceover we can hear a Rilke poem, &quot;The Panther,&quot; (&quot;his gaze has been so worn by the procession...&quot;) And Sayer begins to understand what is going on in the minds of his catatonic patients; though their bodies are dead, their higher mental functions may not be. <br />  <br /> The focus is on one patient, Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro), who for years now has not moved or spoken or really given any sign that he is aware of the world. Sayer discovers, however, that with the use of a certain drug, L-dopa (usually given to people with Parkinson's), the catatonic people can begin to move and &quot;come alive&quot; again. Suddenly the psychiatric ward is full of people who have missed out on decades of their lives, and are trying to come to terms with that. More alarming yet is the fear that the drug's effects will be only temporary. <br />  <br /> Robin Williams delivers a deep, quiet performance as the introverted doctor, a loner who did research on earthworms before taking his position at the psychiatric ward. His work with his patients, particularly Leonard (who is the first to receive L-dopa), teaches the doctor humanity and encourages him to develop a friendship with Eleanor, a sweet and shy nurse (played by Julie Kavner - the voice of Marge Simpson). Robert De Niro is wonderful. He embraces the role completely, delivering it without artifice or bathos. As a whole the movie proceeds slowly, so it's not for the impatient viewer. If you let it, it will draw you in; it really is one of the finest films out there on the human mind and soul.
1592400876|1.0|The high rating for this book is a classic case &quot;The Emperor's new clothes&quot; ! No one want to be left out from the long queue that has lined up outside Aunt Lynn's quaint old cottage in the English countryside. You must be some sort of history freak, or above the age of 70 to like this book. She takes forever to get to the heart of the matter - most of the time is spent doling out ridicule and the condescending tone will get to even the most patient reader at some stage. If you are looking for practical guidance, you are wasting your time here - The very &quot;markety&quot; title doesn't betray the content!
B00003CXXM|5.0|I can't understand why people who love a book keep on hurting themselves by watching movies &quot;adapted&quot; from those books! If you can't go watch a movie knowing that it will not be like the book, DON'T WATCH IT!! Why don't you try to go watch such a movie telling yourself that it's a *different story*. That would be easier on you! <br />  <br /> Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie, I thought the chemistry between Matt Damon and Franka Potente was there and worked well. <br /> I enjoyed the fact that there weren't endless action sequences, I get totally bored with those. I think Matt Damon, because he is not a usual action hero, gave some depth to the character. <br /> I thought the plot was cool (not profound, but good enough) and I had an awesome time. <br /> What else can you expect from a movie? It's great if you have a good time, you can't expect to be changed profoundly by a movie all the time, right? <br />  <br /> I also greatly enjoyed the Bourne Supremacy, I thought it was about the same quality (so people who hated the first movie, please, please, don't go watch the 2nd one!!! It has EVEN LESS to do with the book!!!) <br />  <br />
0679777547|5.0|While I was living it St. Louis, I took this book to Forest Park with me everyday.  I finished it under the huge fountain beneath the Art Museum, and beside the man-made stream near the Muni.  This book was one of the most entertaining reads I have come across in the past year.   <br />Miles better than the movie.  And I'm sorry some of these other reviewers didn't enjoy it as much as I did.  Maybe it's because I would love to have a job (quest) like the main character had.  I found myself turning back and forth from the current page that I was reading to the diagrams of the ancient text (while keeping a close eye on the jogging beauty's passing by).   TALLY-HO SUCKAHS!!
B0000CEB4V|3.0|This DVD features some nice George Harrison covers by some of the music industry's finest musicians who happens to be George's buddies.  The whole movie however could do without the Indian sitar music (i know i'll get some flak from the Indian musicos out there and the Beatle purists)...that music just didn't do it for me...when it was all good old rock and roll George music, its just great and fine and super...Beatles fans should love Clapton's renditions and Billy Preston's piano playing...the ending is quite touching and brought little tears to my eyes...a definite must buy..just fast forward past the Indian music :)
B000053VAF|5.0|I do not recall seeing `Dogma' on any lists of top ten cult movies, usually dominated by `The Rocky Horror Picture Show' and Ed Wood works, but it should be there, cheek and jowl Tim Curry and his musical transvestite crowd. One sure sign of cult greatness is my initial reaction to this movie, which was `Where in the world did this thing come from!!!!'. At the time, I was totally unaware of Kevin Smith's other movies, so I had no inkling of his type of humor or his stock company of Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Smith himself as silent Bob, and, occasionally, Matt Damon. I was also totally unaware of his very positive working relationship with Harvy Weinstein of Mirimax pictures which provided the resources for casting such A list cast members such as `Hans Gruber' himself, Alan Rickman and talents such as Salma Hayek, Chris Rock, and Linda Fiorentino, not to mention the very quirky Alanis Morissette and George Carlin. What an incredible cast for an independent movie from an at the time relatively unknown director whose main claim to Hollywood fame is that he got Mirimax together with Damon and Affleck as executive producer, with View Askew producer Scott Mosier, of the critically very successful `Good Will Hunting'.<br /><br />Getting back to initial gut reactions, my first impression was very similar to seeing `Monty Python and the Holy Grail' for the first time. It is simply so different, yet so funny, that your sense of the talent required to put the movie together is palpable. How did they even think of these things. There are many silly and superficial potty jokes and doper jokes and running gags, but below all that is this very deep concept of what could go wrong if there were some logical flaw in divine thinking, and someone in a position to take advantage of it. This is the point of the title, `Dogma', in that the driving force of the story is a loophole in church dogma which will permit two banished rogue angels, Loki and Bartleby, to reenter heaven contrary to the wishes of God. And, God can't do anything to prevent it. Icing on the cake is an evil spirit Azrael, who cleverly puts God out of the picture temporarily and leaves the handling of the situation to God's right hand angel, played by Alan Rickman.<br /><br />If all this wasn't enough, enter our heros, Jay and Silent Bob, fresh from minor roles in `Mall Rats' and `Chasing Amy' who are their usual doper selves, thrust into the role of assisting the scion of Christ in thwarting the banished angels, Loki and Bartleby (Damon and Affleck) in their plan.<br /><br />A mere synopsis of the plot as I have given above doesn't even come close to capturing all the nuttiness of the business and the depth of the story. I would love to know what inspiration Smith had for naming Loki and Bartleby, but I like to believe it was no accident that he named a Christian angel after a Norse god with a very nasty reputation for mischief.<br /><br />The entire cast gives their best to the movie, although I do get a sense that Affleck and Damon are not breaking much of a sweat and running purely on star power, although it is worth noting that at the time of the movie, Rickman probably had the most substantial reputation, as I believe `Good Will Hunting' had not yet been released.<br /><br />The cinematography, editing, and other technical stuff is adequate, but nowhere near Oscar level quality. The name of the game in this movie is plot, plot, plot. Like all the best comedies, going back at least as far as Shakespeare, in spite of all the fun, there is a clear threat unless our heros can complete a task and, in this case, the threat is the end of the world. No small potatoes.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are a must for all Kevin Smith fans. The voice over commentary to the flick is pretty good and gives a bit more than average `how we did this shot' stuff, including some on set difficulties with some actors and much appreciation for the professionalism of others. It was particularly touching to hear of Jason Mewes being so impressed by the appearance of the very professional Alan Rickman that Mewes learned all his lines before shooting started. It is also surprising to see how little of the business was ad libbed. Almost all of this stuff is in Smith's script. The other extras are mostly candy for Kevin Smith junkies.<br /><br />My queries at the local video store show that this movie has sustained a substantial popularity after a modest release which just managed to recoup its cost. I wish Smith continued success with movies of this ilk, and hope he finds it in his heart to bring back Jay and Silent Bob after his flirt with the main stream style in `Jersey Girl'.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who has or enjoys a quirky sense of humor. And before I forget, Salma Hayek and Chris Rock are a blast in this movie which even merited a sequel shared with `Chasing Amy', in `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'.It was particularly touching to hear of Jason Mewes being so impressed by the appearance of the very professional Alan Rickman that Mewes learned all his lines before shooting started.

B00005JN2F|5.0|Well, I thought that it was as good or even better than the first one. <br />Matt Damon as an action hero rocks. <br />I would put a 4 star review for the STUPID CAMERA THAT'S MOVING ALL THE TIME, but still it wasn't enough to spoil the whole movie for me, so I'm keeping the 5 stars. <br />But please, like somebody else said BUY A TRIPOD ALREADY!!! <br />The beginning of the movie had me nauseated! I guess I got used to it after a while, or I was really into the movie enough to not notice it so much anymore. <br />I am glad each time I get to see an action movie where you actually feel for the characters.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Bruce Springsteen has become somewhat of a legend. With gritty lyrics, rugged voice, and just plain awesome instrumental talents, he is a musician's musician--and this collection shows you why.<br /><br /> It collects songs from all of his previous albums (although only one track is included from the HUMAN TOUCH album; kinda disappointing, but then that's just me). From GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK, N.J. to THE RISING, you'll find songs hand-picked by the Boss himself, a three-CD collection designed to introduce new fans to the his music, while a bonus disc attracts those who've been around a while.<br /><br /> Let's talk about the bonus disc. It was somewhat of a disappointment to me; a few of the songs were good (&quot;From Small Things...&quot;, &quot;The Big Payback,&quot; &quot;Trapped,&quot; &quot;County Fair,&quot; &quot;Code of Silence,&quot; his version of &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;), but many were not (espeically those using his falsetto voice; dear God, we didn't need to hear that, Bruce!).<br /><br /> Overall, this is an astounding collection. From such rock classics as &quot;Born to Run,&quot; &quot;Thunder Road,&quot; &quot;Born in the USA,&quot; &quot;Glory Days,&quot; and &quot;The River,&quot; to his more folksier stuff like &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad,&quot; to the drum-looping of the haunting &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot; and several of the bonus tracks...well, this is quite an ecclectic collection from one of music's most talented and diverse artists. From rock to pop to jazz to country...Springsteen covers it all. THE ESSENTIAL BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN is a must-have collection for music fans of all genres. 42 songs, 2 CD's...pure Springsteen all the way. Essential? Of course.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is my very favourite album of all time.  Its my desert island disc.  I mean, if it would melt in my cd player so that i could never take it out to put another cd, I wouldn't really care.  The overall Mood of this album is delightful.

B000089CJI|5.0|Do yourself a HUGE favor and go buy this cd.  The Postal Service, hands down, is one of the best cd's I have ever bought in my life.  It totally changed me and my views of music and opened the door to another genre of music.  I bought Dntel shortly after the purchase of TPS and Dntel is amazing as well.  I even bought 2 Deathcab cd's and they are a great band too.  This is the only cd, that when it ended with Natural Anthem, I was so disappointed.  It was such a good cd, that I was not ready for it to end.  Go buy it now!
B000062Y98|5.0|As much as I don't like calling a band the best in a gender, I have to say it. Blind Guardian is the best Power Metal band in the world.  <br /> Why?  <br /> Because they are great musicians <br /> Another reason? <br /> Because they EVOLVE  <br /> Want some more?  <br /> Because that man called Hansi Kursh is a TERRIFIC songwriter and his creations are incredible. <br /> It doesn't matter how good a band is, it won't be enjoyed by the entire world, so if you are a closed minded metalhead that only likes Suffocation (A great band indeed, but not similar to Blind Guardian), then you won't appreciate the beauty of this CD.  <br /> A lot of Production? Yes but hey!! It doesn't matter. That's what makes this CD a HUGE creation. A work of art. Blind Guardian began almost as a Helloween (Old Helloween) clone but they evolved. &quot;Somewhere far Beyond&quot;, their fourth album, already sounded like a special an totally unique band. It had &quot;the sound of the Guardian&quot; Speed Power Metal but unique. Then, &quot;Imaginations of the other Side&quot; stunned the fans. It was fast and Heavy but it had a unique (yes, &quot;unique&quot; again) atmosphere. With &quot;Nightfall&quot;, they slowed down a little bit to show us how good they are and that they were big and again, different from the rest. The riffs, the solos. Plus the story of Tolkkien's &quot;Silmarillion&quot;, one of my favorite books (More than a book, is a bible of fantasy). Everything was great.  <br /> Now, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; is a masterpiece. It is well known that Queen is Hansi Kursch's favorite band and if you listen to this and to &quot;Nightfall&quot;, you can listen how he wants to sound like Freddy Mercury (Really, maybe you didn't like that comment but that's the way it is). I own all the Blind Guardian material and is so easy to realize how Kursh has changed from a less than average frontman (that used to play bass before &quot;Nightfall&quot;)to one of the Top 5 singers and Top 5screamers (both at the same time) in the entire gender of Metal. He doesn't play bass anymore, but he still writes all the music among with Andre Olbrich (Lead guitar). Every song progresses. They start slow and they get some speed and with backing vocals they just blow you away. Seriously, this CD is THAT good. If you listened to it and you ended like \\"Uh, well, I didn't get it\\" after the first time, then that's ok. Give it another try like I did. It will grow inside of you. Those CDs that grow inside of you and that make you appreciate them after the first try, are those that you end up enjoining the most. This album is ahead of our time. It will be appreciated in the future even more than now.  <br /> Oh I almost forgot, \\"And then there was Silence\\". As a reviewer said somewhere, whether you are a fan of Power Metal of any kind of Music (Real Music) or any kind of Metal, (Get close to the screen) <br /> YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO \\"AND THEN THERE WAS SILENCE\\". <br /> &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; shares the first place with \\"The Oddyssey\\" of Symphny X of best Metal album of 2002.  <br /> I love Metal, I really do. Is my favorite type of music. However, this CD, is just beyond Metal. Buy it!!!! <br />  <br /> Are you some curious guy that ended up here reading this because somebody recommended it and you are tired of the incompetent crappy bands that MTV shows you? <br /> BUY IT!!! <br /> Are you a good music lover ? <br /> BUT IT!!! <br /> Are you a Blind Guardian fan? <br /> You have this already <br /> You like the old Guardian? <br /> Give this a second chance, you won't regret it. This doesn't sound like the old Guardian, but this is GOOD MUSIC. Don't stay with one type of music and don't stay with one type of Metal. The more you close your mind, the more good sounds from around the world you will miss. <br /> Overall, the best CD of the best Power Metal band.  <br /> Hail the mighty Blind Guardian!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00007BK2N|2.0|Dont buy this for a &quot;good time&quot; party.....This is the story of one reporter would be club owner who latches onto the coming&quot;new wave&quot; music and wants to cash in. These people are located in Manchester England , which always seem gloomy to me. The drug use seems more pathological than fun. Also this DVD claims music scene...what music scene? There are really only 2 groups focused on (if you consider that &quot;New Order&quot; is a sprout of &quot;Joy Division&quot;) <br /> Joy Division/New Order and Happy Mondays. <br /> If you are into these groups you may like it, however it still does not focus on the creative process's of the musicians as much as tell the story of the club owner dude.  <br /> EXTRAS: the real person who is the club owner states in the extra interview that he doesnt understand why he is the main character and that he thought the musicians should have been <br /> (that should tell you something) <br /> I did get some info on music creation...one part of story is when a producer tells the joy divisiion drummer to throw away the massive drumset and come up with a smaller kit and create a new drum sound, and sets him up on the &quot;roof&quot; to practice relearning to drum. However that doesnt make the band look to good to me because it was production and not the Musicians who created their special sound. However when the singer for Joy Division wasnt there they reformed as New Order and had to come up with new music and it showed some of that,,, but not enough! <br /> Note: in the club as a result of the New Order sound or to coincide with it the rave scene was born, and thats mostly what the club turned into. Not much scenes of that party either.....DUD
B00000I1OY|1.0|I happened to watch this messed-up film on TV late one night where I live in Japan, and found this example of a &quot;movie&quot; to be utterly distasteful. First of all, Burt's charachter tries to &quot;make it&quot; with just about every woman he meets, if she's young and beautiful. Second, the story-line seems rather aimless and pointless: about a man who came from just about nowhere only to wind up distraught in a rainstorm at his house which ahd been abandoned for some time. Third, it showed human nature at it's very lowest, the only ones seemingly who cared about the swimmer were a friend he owed a lot of bills to and his ex-lover, who was civil to him for a brief moment, both of these being towards the end of the film (this isn't counting the pretty, young lady he said had been his baby sitter. He tried to &quot;make it&quot; with her, only to see her run off away from him somewhere in the midst of the movie...).<br /><br /> Cponclusion: don't waste your time with this one. Burt Lancaster was an excellent actor, and while he does a good job in this one - as in all of his films - I'm quite disappointed that he chose to be in this film, protraying a charachet that is far below some of his other portrayals.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I have listened to rap for ages, its good stuff but Kanye, MAN HES AWSOME, if uve ever seen crict's reviews on this album they say that his song &quot;the new workout plan&quot; takes the album down BUT MAN THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST SONGS has a real catchy beat and rythm. ALL OF THE TRACKS ARE AWSOME, the skits are funny, and the beats ARE GREAT. This CD is real if u like rap THEN BUY this CD u HAVE TO HAVE IT its a classic. If i could i could give this a 6/5 stars. One of the best CD's ive heard in a long time. Also if u wanna hear a good RnB CD get the Mario Winans &quot;Hurt No More&quot; CD its awsome. And if u wanna hear an artist thats gonna be big soon u mite wanna listen to John Legend hes good.
B000089RVX|5.0|At first I didn't really like Evanescence. &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; was a little repetitive and I got sick of it fast. But then I heard the cd &quot;Fallen&quot; and I fell in love with it right away. I can sit and listen to Amy Lee for hours. If there perfect voice out there, it's hers. I only wish that I could sing half that good. I love how dark her music is, yet her voice can sound so angelic and light. It sounds like it takes her no effort to belt it out! When I'm feeling down, I can go and listen to their music and just rock out, and although the mood of it is pretty dark, I live for that kind of music. I think my favorites have got to be &quot;Whisper&quot;, &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, &quot;Going Under&quot;, and &quot;Imaginary&quot;. I can't get enough of it. The only drwback of their music is that I can't sing along with it, or I sound worse than I usually do. When their next album comes out, I'll be the first one to the store to buy it. I can't wiat. Evanescence rocks!! Also, if you like Evanescence, I think you'd love Linkin Park &quot;Meteora&quot;, cuz I did!
0385486804|5.0|'Into Thin Air' became a (controversial) international phenomenon that will allow Jon Krakauer to do any project he wants to consider, regardless of sellability concerns, market acceptance, etc.  The hard-earned success of 'Air' has earned him that right.  But I'm certainly not alone in my opinion that 'Into the Wild' will always be Krakauer's best work.  While a compelling story in its own right, let's not overlook the masterful reporting required by the author in piecing together the last couple of years of Christopher McCandless' short, confused life.  It's a very impressive, comprehensive effort.<br /><br />I also like the way Krakauer - without any sense of self aggrandizement - is able to draw parallels between McCandless and his own period as 'The Angry Young Man,' going off on (retrospectively) foolish solo mountain climbs.<br /><br />As pointed out by others on these pages, I read this book over six years ago, but recall passages of it with a clarity that I can't claim for any other reading experience.  Isn't that what every writer strives to do?
B0000AM6K2|5.0|Josh Rouse has been writing strong ,fully rounded melodies with meticulous lyrics for many years yet it's with the release of \\" 1972 \\" that the time for his career to take off has finally come . Rykodisc , his record label seems to feel the same way and so , with his latest offering one will find a dvd-documentary film with interviews and clips from his live shows .          Back to the music now , Rouse's newest release is full of nostalgic pop and rock gems ,most of them melancholic yet in the warmest possible way . What is really interesting is how a song like \\" Come Back \\" which is instantly catchy and uplifting evolves as seconds go by and blossoms even more . First cd-single \\" Love Vibration \\" is hopefully a future number one radio hit while the tittle track is lo-fi and sweetly murmured yet it's the sad and tender \\" James \\" which stands out . The quality is unquestionable , the flute parts are simply amazing .       It's good to see that in times like these , an artist as discreet and down-to-earth as Rouse can shine only with the help of his talent . Hats off to the gentleman then .
B0001XAPX8|4.0|Apparently there is less shame in being Jewish than in being Black for the protagonist.  Can any sympathy go to him, when he has purposefully and arbitrarily removed himself from his family?  They didn't deserve that treatment, that loss.  Or is this just an extension of the racial tensions in the country at the end of the War . . and sacrifice was necessary for any black to achieve success?  The casting was not credible.  Why couldn't they have used make-up to age the young Silk, rather than use two actors, one of which could never be taken for anything but white.  And the relationship between a 70 year old and a 34 year old was not credible either.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|If you have not heard of the name Gavin DeGraw yet, you will very soon. His single &quot;I Don't Want to Be&quot; is already causing a stir and is just a small part of what makes his record &quot;Chariot&quot; so hot and fresh. His undeniable talent shines through in every word as he seems to dig deep into his own soul to uncover the underlying secrets of emotion that are a part of every person. His classic sound is raw, yet groove-worthy and keeps you begging for more. His work is real and full of substance. His words mean something that are understandable to those true at heart. You can't help but to hang on to every note and feeling emitted from songs like &quot;Follow Through&quot; and &quot;Belief&quot; and &quot;Meaning.&quot; Once you hear the first note, you are hooked! He amazingly blends in inspiration from all genres of music into a sound that moves souls. His songs are what make music powerful and remind us that life is worth singing about. Not enough words can explain the beauty in his music, you just have to listen to it for yourself...and you'll be glad you did. Believe him when he says &quot;this is the start of something good.&quot;
0920668372|5.0|i read this book to my nephews on a regular basis. it was purchased by my mom and will remain a classic in our family. the moms actions are over the top but this is to prove a point. if people remember that this is a childrens book the inner child in them may be found again. this is a tear jerker that should have won a caldecott award.<br /><br />if, on the off chance, this book brings up the issue of death then discuss that topic with your child. there are great books on that subject. unfortunately my grandfather died when my nephews were very young (6 mths and 1 1/2 year) so they were not afraid of death. they saw the family celebrate life and this book teaches us to do that-express your love while the person is alive so that there will be no doubt of your love being forever!
B00006JDVV|4.0|Reign of Fire isn't as bad as some of the reviews here say it is.  The key to enjoying this film is to recognize it for what it is--a B movie.  If you see a B movie and expect a great movie, then you'll be let down.  You have to be in the right mindset to enjoy it. <br /> <br />Basically, a hibernating dragon is unearthed on modern Earth, and then from that one dragon, the planet becomes overrun by dragons.  It's not explained how that one dragon produced enough offspring to destroy the world, but B movies are not about science lectures.  Flash forward to the future.  Pockets of humanity are scratching out an existance.  Most of the world is destroyed.  A group of British survivors, are doing everything they can to survive, when one day a group of American dragon hunters happen upon their dwelling.  The Americans have a plan to end the dragon threat, but the British are a little cautious of the crazy plan.  Will it succeed?  Kick back and enjoy this piece of B movie fluff.
1563890119|5.0|This is the first in a series of graphic novels that is, in my opinion, one of the most incredible stories written in the 20th century. I often tell people that reading the Sandman series changed me as a person because it made me re-think the limits of human creativity. That may sound over the top, but my god, in a series of about 75 comic books, Neil Gaiman created a new mythology, one that speaks to the modern, western world.  <br />   In this collection of the first eight comic books, Dream sets out to reclaim tools he lost during a 75 year captivity, and to rebuild his disintegrating kingdom. Though not my favorite story arc in the entire series, it is the beginning, and to fully appreciate the story it is definitely the place to start.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This is one of the few recent cast albums that made me want to see the show itself. Instead of the ponderous and overwrought, or raunchy and self-important, this is a score that has actual songs with actual melodies and understandable lyrics. When I saw the show, I thoroughly enjoyed it -- just like I did this album. Granted, it's not &quot;South Pacific&quot; or &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; -- but it is pretty darned good. I recommend it.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|It has been quite a while since I even felt like heading to the big screen theater for any movie, until Van Helsing came out.  It is a fantasy thrill ride, and a must see for anyone that loves the genre!  I thought it was the best vampire movie I have seen to date, and I have seen most of them.  This movie is pure fun, and should be viewed as such!  Hugh Jackman, and Kate Beckinsale bring a very energetic, and fresh feel to the whole genre, that I truly appreciated.  I can't wait for the sequel, and the television series that has been discussed for release this fall.  I LOVED IT !!!
B00005T30L|3.0|I do think that this is one of the best roles for Thora Birch so far, Enid, the bitter Daria like outsider.  The movie unfortunately is made to be a realistic look of a time that I would rather forget, and people that you don't always want to know.    Enid is a classically angst ridden girl.  She is smart enough to know how illusion ridden the world is around her, but not smart enough to know what her part in this is.  So she and her friend are the definition of defeatist youth.  They have little ambition, like to play cruel jokes, and everything seems to exist for them to criticize.  Due to their temperment they aren't good at keeping jobs, so spend a lot of time with their artwork and practical jokes.  School wasn't over long ago, but they have few friends from the experience and it is quickly turning into faded memories.    This turns around when they are looking through the I saw you ads of their local paper and find one of a lonely man who felt that something had passed between him and a girl he met at an airport.  So they make a response to the ad and arrange a meeting to see what will happen when the man shows up finds no one is coming to meet him.  This is where they meet Steve Buscemi's nerdy character, working at an office for a fried chicken company, and a vinyl junkie.    They watch him and for some reason Enid becomes fascinated with him and starts befriending him and learning about his life.  Trying to break him out of his dull day by day existence.    Then the film seems to take a down turn.  Enid starts to see her world quickly crumbling around her.  Her father has a new girlfriend and thinks she should move out.  Her best friend is getting frustrated with the fact that Enid isn't going anywhere and giving up on their plans.  Her attempts at holding a job with her tendency to make jokes at everything around her and temper fail miserably.    I think that this movie is well made, but I just didn't like it.  The characters were realistic, the situationsfamilar, the filming and casting had a gritty and realistic quality, but it seemed shallow in a lot of ways.  A lot of the characters just are, there is little to no background on them.      Plus the main character, Enid, is extremely difficult to like.  She is too defeatist and depressing to really get into.  Her character goes from one self initiated disaster to another, her wit seeming less and less endearing, and her character seeming less and less intelligent.  There are some times when the feelings of lonlieness and confusion hit her character and you feel a spark for her.  But her tendency to take others with her when she falls ruins it.  Enid attacks people for fun or lashes out at others for her emotional problems.  You never really see why she is so hostile to everybody in her life, and this is a big part of her character. Or why she is so intersted in Steve Buschemi's character.  I also found her best friend a mystery, a girl thats just there.    Though I think that the film was wonderfully made, I just didn't like it.  The characters were too defeatist and their rapid spiral downward too frustrating to want to watch twice.  As well as the many unanswered questions about the characters.      I hope that the director and actress do something else that is in similar caliber, but with different material, because it shows a lot of potential.
006092988X|5.0|I have read this book more than once and I own old hardback originals as well as the recent edition.<br /><br />  I absolutely love to read of the extremes the human spirit can endure and survive. We know now that children like Francie Nolan would be called resilient children, because they bounce back like the fabled tree growing thrugh the harsh concrete jungles of the brooklyn 'ghetto'. Unfortunately, we have way too many children who can survive such hardship with a resilient spirit.<br /><br />  It isn't merely the storyline that is engrossing, it is the tone and voice, the narrative nuances captured by the writer, Betty Smith, that allow you to see with your mind, but identify with Francie and her plight with your heart.<br /><br />  Even more inspiring is the triumphant spirit of this little girl under duress. It makes one proud to be human. I work in domestic violence field and I have given this gift as an inspiration to particularly challenged children and even ten and twelve year olds can appreciate A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, it becomes emotional meat for their bones and soul.
B000002MTR|4.0|This cd gets a bad rap from a lot of people because it is a different sound than many people are used form the chili peppers. And while it is in no means BSSM, this is still a great Cd in my opinion. The production is a little different, it is a little more mellow. Even the harder songs seem a little mellowed out. And I dont just mean Daves guitar, the actual vocals do sound different. <br />  <br /> Warped-I didnt like this song at first, I thought it was kind of messy, but it has grown on me. Its a much different sound for them, almost psychadelic. Its a grower, givie it a chance. <br />  <br /> Aeroplane-One of the more well-known songs off the cd, this song is very catchy. The chourus will stay in your head all day. I prefer the verses as they seem to be a more funky sound, which i like. A very fun song. <br />  <br /> Deep Kick-The first few minutes of this song are just spoken word, i prefer to skip them, but once it kicks in, this is a very funky song. After a slow start, it turns out to be a highlight. <br />  <br /> My Friends-A gret ballad for the chili peppers. This is a beutiful acoustic song, great vocals by anthony. Daves guitar is great, simple but complex at the same time. Everyone can love this song. <br />  <br /> Coffee Shop- This is a hard rocker through and through. A great bass line by flea, and some pretty wierd but cool vocals by kiedes. This song will have you out of your seat in no time &quot;dancing like iggy pop&quot;. <br />  <br /> Pea-This song is hilarious. This is flea all by himself, bass and vocals. The bass is very catchy, though i would consider this more of an interlude than a real song. Still very fun to listen to. <br />  <br /> One Big Mob-This sounds like old chili peppers from back in the 80s. Cool lyrics and hard rocking all over the place. If you didnt know better, youd think you were listening to uplift mofo party plan. <br />  <br /> Walkabout-One of favorites. A very chilled-out groovy song with Kiedes singing about finding yourself over a simple groove. Just listen and flow with it, and it will be impossible not to have a good time. <br />  <br /> Tearjerker-Touching song about Kurt Cobain. You really can feel the love the band shows for the late tortured genious, and this probably isnt the song to put you in a good mood. great song, you will be moved, though it isnt the most passionate ode to a fallen friend on the cd. <br />  <br /> One Hot Minute-Lots of people dont like this song, i absolutley love it. This song rocks very hard, and is probably my favorite on the album. This is one of the hard rockers that sopunds mellow. If this song doesnt put an adreniline rush through you, i dont you what will. <br />  <br /> Falling Into Grace- Like &quot;Walkabout&quot;, this is another chill out groove track. Kiedes' sooting vocals in the chourus make this a great song to go to sleep to, or just one to listen to while you are chilling or in a mellow mood. This is very different from the song before it. <br />  <br /> Shallow Be Thy Game-Another hard rocker, this one has a great verses and chourus, instruments are very good, this one is seemingly a religious song, but regardless of what its about this is a straight forward rocker, that everyone will love. Certainly a highlight, and it sounds kind of like the old band. <br />  <br /> Transcending-Here is the most passionate song on the cd. About the late Rivers Pheonix, this is very hard song to put your finger on. It starts out slower, and feels like a ballad, but escalates into an all-out rocker at the end, complete with screaming by Kiedes. <br />  <br /> Overall this is a very good album, different from the others but still is definitley worth your time. Give it a try.
B0001US62I|4.0|Re- Hutzler review below*  <br /> I have the identical problem on my dvd where the vision freezes temporarily and the sound drops out during the transition between chapters 1 & 2, yes v.annoying! Seems OK elsewhere.  <br /> btw, being a &quot;Special Ed.&quot; I would like to have seen some extended scenes, alt takes or deleted scenes, as I know many were filmed but were edited out. An opportunity lost..  <br />  <br />  <br /> *Great Dvd, but........., July 25, 2004  <br /> Reviewer: M. Hutzler &quot;Film Fan&quot; (Canada)  <br />  <br /> I admit picture and sound are exemplary but could someone out  <br /> there please clarify and or confirm a serious problem that I  <br /> have with my disc. Immediately following the director's credit  <br /> as the camera is moving out of the dark alleyway onto the busy  <br /> downtown N.Y. street filled with traffic the picture stops or  <br /> &quot;pauses&quot; for a few seconds before moving forward. Has anyone  <br /> else encountered this problem? Help! please let me know as this  <br /> is a major debit for this film fan!
B0001CCXY8|2.0|WOW another Cannibal Corpse album. If you've heard Bloodthirst and Gore Obssesed than you've heard Wretched Spawn. CC breaks no ground they haven't tread on already. Fact is if you put any song off the Wretched Spawn onto the previous 2 albums you would never know the difference. Now I see why Jack Owen left. Pure boredom and now more creativity. I have loved CC since their inception and have watched them develop into some of metal's finest musicians each album they have put out. They really made death metal what it is today.  <br />However this album just makes me bored. I'm not just talking about the lyrics cause I never really listened to CC for the lyrics. They have a song writing style and a sound they have settled into and it hasn't changed for the past 3 albums. THat formula equals reptition.  <br />  Hardcore CC fans will like this one just cause of the band name but after this one I'm not going to rush out and buy something I've been listening to for the past 4 years. It's the same album I've been listening to since Bloodthirst.
6305428220|5.0|A long time ago..before this movie was ever made, I thought of a cool idea of a movie where the teachers would be aliens. I guess they beat me to it lol. There version looked alot better than what I had thought should happen. The only negiative remark I have is that I wish the DVD could have been more of a &quot;special edition&quot; becuase I remembering seeing scenes in the theatrical trailers that were not in the movie. Plus they could of done a commentary and so on. This would also be a great movie to make into infinifilm
0783231032|5.0|But I think that's what works in this film! Although a lot of critics have given this film thumbs down remarks and bad reviews, I for one enjoy it. When reading a biography on Stephen Spielberg, I discovered that he had planned on turning the second world war into HIS version of my all-time favorite film, It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. The poster art done for the film is pure &quot;Mad World&quot;. It depicts every single character from the film be it major, minor, or extra, and it shows action shots of things you can see in the movie; Murray Hamilton and Eddie Deezen on the ferris wheel with the Dummy, a theater marquee announcing Walt Disney's Dumbo playing, and of course Captain Wild Bill Kelso (John Belushi) flying his airplane directly towards the audience. <br />  <br /> In my opinion, Spielberg stood true to his word and did in fact give audiences &quot;It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World...War&quot;. Originally, he was going to call the film &quot;The Night The Japs Attacked&quot; but of course, that title wouldn't be accepted by most companies. 1941 contains exactly the kind of material that was seen in &quot;Mad World&quot;; a cavalcade cast that included (In Alphabetical Order) Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, John Belushi, Lorraine Garay, Murray Hamilton, Christopher Lee, Tim Matheson, Toshir Mifune, Warren Oates, Robert Stack, Treat Williams and classic minor roles performed by Lucille Benson, John Candy, Elisha Cook Jr., Eddie Deezen, Patti LuPone, Penny Marshall, Frank McRae, Slim Pickens, Wendie Jo Sperber, Lionel Stander, Dub Taylor, Iggie Wolfington, Joe Flaherty, David L. Lander, Michael McKean, Susan Backlinie, Mickey Rourke, and Donovan Scott. <br />  <br /> Most people forget that there's a big love triangle in the story involving Bobby DiCicco and Dianne Kay and how they must deal with Treat Williams' harshness and rudeness. That's probably because Spielberg had filmed so much that the audience couldn't decide which characters were more important to focus on! Hence why when the film was first released on video, it only ran 2 hours long and was billed as a &quot;HOME VIDEO VERSION&quot;.  <br />  <br /> When the DVD was re-released in 2003, there were a few minor changes. The DVD disc itself remained 100% the same as it did when it arrived on shelves in 1998, however the re-release changed the cover art and replaced the expansive collectible booklet that was placed inside the cover with a smaller &quot;Chapters & Bonus Features&quot; insert instead. <br />  <br /> The Director's Cut of the film really adds more depth to the plot lines. The DVD was essentially put together in the same format as the &quot;Universal Signature Collection&quot; Laserdisc of 1941. It includes the newly restored 2.35:1 Scope Widescreen presentation of the film with all 26 minutes of cut footage intact and in widescreen as well, a restored Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound audio track, 2 teaser trailers (the 1st one allows audiences to discover that Belushi's name was originally going to be Wild WAYNE Kelso) and 1 theatrical trailer, an extra collection of unrestored deleted scenes (some of which are missing audio) and outtakes, a documentary featuring interviews with Stephen Spielberg, Bob Gale, Robert Zemeckis, John Milius, and John Williams, within the documentary are on-set home movies done by Spielberg and alternate takes not included in the deleted scenes section, a photo gallery, and advertising campaign gallery. Among the &quot;Text Only&quot; bonus features are production notes and reviews of the film from 1978-1979. <br />  <br /> As I said earlier, most people hated this film because of the millions of characters and plot lines but to me I consider it almost a cult classic. Like Dr. Strangelove, it took on a serious American issue and made it into a farce, giving people something to smile and laugh at. Therefore, 1941 in my opinion deserves 5 stars. <br />  <br /> &quot;So long mama, I'm off to Yokohama!&quot;-Wild Bill Kelso.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I remember hearing about this show before it aired, What I was told is that &quot;It is about a grieving family greving the loss of their mother and moving to a new envirnoment&quot; <br /> When I heard what it was about and after watching the Pilot episode. I could totaly relate to the lead actor playing the son and the family as well because I was about the lead son's age when my father suddenly died. So I loved how there was a show that can totally show what I went through. The only difference I find not real was the fact that the father of the show is so rich, he doesn't even charge his patients for his practice. I find that a little unrealistic because majority of widows out there are not millionares. Anyway I enjoyed watching the chemistry of &quot;The Browns&quot; the most because I found a show that you can really relate to. I'll be buying this DVD on the release date.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|Franz Ferdinand represents what is truely wrong with the music industry...FF trys to coax their listeners into all the &quot;new-old&quot; fad bands out there...&quot;Oh you like the Strokes..well here is such-and-such. What? Not in the mood for that, well how about some Interpolish flavor?&quot; Really, how about showing some creativity? That's what it use to be about anyways. UKish bands before FF did and still do (see Blur's &quot;Think Tank&quot;), but not these guys. It makes you wonder does the O.C. just exist to sponsor their own breed of carbon copy bands of curent hits (Jet, etc.)? The bands they try to emulate may not be head and shoulders creative musical geniuses, but they do their craft well. Franz Ferdinand does not. Yawn.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I was looking forward to this film but it far exceeded my expectations. The interviews with soldiers and their relatives are particularly poignant. Moore once again shows his skill, not only at capturing amazing footage and interviews, but at editing that footage into an absolutely mesmerizing film. It's funny, it's sad. and it's true.
B000002H33|5.0|This is the most exciting album Metallica ever made! Don't let the classical guitar intro to &quot;Battery&quot; fool you, this cd kicks a**! If you care about great thrash metal bands like Metallica, buy this album, don't download it! Show your pride for metal, buy this cd, show people the evil devil's horns hand signal, and keep on listening to loud heart punding music until you're six feet underground!
B00024BHTC|3.0|Half the reviewers love this, half seem to hate it. <br />Whatever, does it really matter?  This music will not appeal to everybody, but if you want to listen to some fast, tight Neo-classical based rock, Nightwish will be up your street.  They also make a change from all the Hip-Hop metal trash that's out there at the moment.
B000002KHH|4.0|This is an amazing cd and illustrates Black Sabbath at their best. With the exception of the song &quot;Planet Cavern&quot; (who decided that bongos and acoustic guitar belonged on a metal album?),the cd is great. This album combines riffs going at the speed of light with eerie vocals. This is a must have for any metal fan!
B000286S8S|1.0|Best of both worlds misses some classic tracks in my mind: <br />Atomic Punk, DOA, Spanish Fly, Somebody get me a doctor, Mean Street, Sinners Swing, Hang em High, 316 etc etc. <br />I can see why people are frustrated with this record cause when you release 14 out of 17 tracks on a previous compilation, it does seem a little dia.  The new tracks aren't my cup of tea, but neither were the new DLR tracks on the previous comp.  Perhaps this is what VH are doing from now, releasing comps each time with a few new tracks?
B0000251VS|3.0|I have been listening to, and loving Iron Maiden's music for some time now. But I wouldn't recommend people to buy this cd. There isn't anything wrong with it, just that it was a very early work made before the band helped define the speed metal sub-genre with lightning fast riffs and throaty vocals.
B000092Q4U|4.0|awsome cd better then the first. When some one I know starts listing to it they can't stop. a must buy for metal fans
B00024BHTC|5.0|To most of the bashers: I don't see many suggestions regarding better bands and singers. Please list the better female vocalists and bands rather than just bashing Nightwish.  I'm sure many of us would love to find some more great music!!  In the USA it would seem we are somewhat shy on decent female vocalists.  Although I have probably not heard them all, of the currently performing ladies the only US female singers that seem to be be worthy of note would be:  Amy Lee ( Evanesence), Faith Hill and Ann Wilson (Heart).  All of these ladies  have the  strength, range and projection to be truly great vocalists . Sheryl Crow is a great songwriter but doesn't have great projection (IMO). I have been looking for great female vocalists for a long time and Tarja is the best I've found to date. Floor Jansen (After Forever), Sharon den Adel (Within Temtation) and Chirstina Scabbia (Lacuna Coil) are also very good.  Many other European bands have great female vocalists such as Impressions Of Winter, Ambion, Edenbridge, Delight that are well woth listening to. If we go back a few years some more USA singers would also make the grade: Joan Baez, Grace Slick and Bev Bivens come to mind immediately, and would have the talent to make the list of great vocalists. Annie Lennox, Kate Bush and Marie Fredrickson are also excellent singers well worth listening to, and I'm sure I've missed several or more. Of couse music preference is very subjective  and I have daughters that think Brittany, Beyounce and Chistina A are very good vocalists; I happened to watch a Jessica Simpson MTV  video one morning during a bout of insomnia, pretty sad. Can't sing , can't dance, why is this woman selling millions of Cd's?, rather amazing! oh well!
B000001ELP|1.0|What a dull and extremely boring album YAWN.A disgrace of a album and quite possibly the worst by these morons.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I was rather surprised by the mature sound of this album. Not that their previous album was bad or anything, it's more that this album sounded very little like their last. Also, I found myself liking more of the songs off Thirteenth Step than their last album, which was more hit-and-miss (though songs such as Hallow, Judith, and 3 Libras are priceless). That being said, here's how I broke the album down: <br />  <br /> 1) The Package: 7/10 This song begins interesting, builds, builds, then finally explodes a little too harshly for my ears. I've read similar reviews from others on this song wishing it had not been track 1, and it really goes on for too long. <br /> 2) Weak and Powerless: 9/10 Easily one of my favorite A Perfect Circle songs, this is a melodious charmer. The only reason I rated it 9/10 is because it seems like it could use a more soaring final chorus, similar to Judith, yet it remains low-key. <br /> 3) The Noose: 9/10 This became the first song I truly loved that did not or has not yet received radio play. The quiet beginning and resounding chorus really sinks in after a while and won't get out of your head. That's not a bad thing. <br /> 4) Blue: 9/10 Continues the streak of good songs that is the best part of the CD. I heard this on the radio passing through Salt Lake City the day I'd bought the CD to listen to while on the road, so it stuck with me and grew on me. It's a heavy, dark, gritty song, reminiscent of their last album. <br /> 5) Vanishing: 4/10 Ends the streak of good songs with this disappointing and very experimental song. I see the dark edge they tried to take here, but it failed. <br /> 6) A Stranger: 8/10 Some accuse this of being a &quot;sleepy&quot; song. I consider it a very expressive song, quite unlike anything I've heard from A Perfect Circle. It's not deep like 3 Libras, but it runs along the same lines and is very relaxing. <br /> 7) The Outsider: 8.5/10 A quality radio song, this one is very much like their previous album,possibly the most reminiscent of all songs on this album. I absolutely loved the lyrics, it's the guilt-trip approach to suicide, screw other such anti-suicide songs by Blink 182 or 3rd Eye Blind, this one takes the cake. <br /> 8) Crimes: 6/10 A filler song, very odd, nothing more to say really. I wish they'd added a few more real songs and took out more of their filler songs. <br /> 9) The Nurse Who Loved Me: 9/10 Any cover of a Failure song is fine by me, I'm a Failure fan. This version is even better than the original, they took out the off-key guitar and replaced it with a haunting background vocal and a dreamy melody. The lyrics contrast with this melody so oddly, and it works. <br /> 10) Pet: 6/10 Not bad, just not great. Didn't strike me as anything that stands out, I usually skip this one along with the other lower-rated songs. <br /> 11) Lullaby: 7/10 Even though it's a filler, it's a nice transition into the next song, but again it's only a filler. <br /> 12) Gravity: 8.5/10 Great way to end the song, a fairly gentle song that gives closure to a far more melody-driven rather than guitar or drums-driven album. <br />  <br /> I am a huge fan of the drummer for A Perfect Circle, and of the lead guitarist, and in some ways their first album gave them more to do than this one. However, when I balance the lack of strong guitar/drums against the mature melody-driven songs of this album, this one tops the other. I can't say I absolutely loved this album, but it has enough high points that I'd strongly recommend it. <br />
B000002HMH|1.0|This is Metallica at their WORST.This album and the rest that follow are simply FU KED.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I watched 'The Passion of the Christ,' and as the credits rolled, I was incredibly surprised, not to mention overwhelmed. There were flaws; most films during the year often have them. But I must say, although I understand where most were coming from when hating this film, I'm still quite shocked there were so many that accused director Mel Gibson of producing an &quot;artistic failure&quot; or a movie full of anti-semitism. Read what Roger Ebert wrote here, and you'll see why I didn't throw similar accusations at Gibson or his film.      &quot;A reasonable person, I believe, will reflect that in this story set in a Jewish land, there are many characters with many motives, some good, some not, each one representing himself, none representing his religion. The story involves a Jew who tried no less than to replace the established religion and set himself up as the Messiah. He was understandably greeted with a jaundiced eye by the Jewish establishment while at the same time finding his support, his disciples and the founders of his church entirely among his fellow Jews. The libel that the Jews &quot;killed Christ&quot; involves a willful misreading of testament and teaching: Jesus was made man and came to Earth in order to suffer and die in reparation for our sins. No race, no man, no priest, no governor, no executioner killed Jesus; he died by God's will to fulfill his purpose, and with our sins we all killed him. That some Christian churches have historically been guilty of the sin of anti-Semitism is undeniable, but in committing it they violated their own beliefs.&quot;      I agree that Christians believe Christ died because it was part of God's plan. And according to the Bible, the Jews were not responsible, nor were the Romans: it was the collective sin in the world in past, present and future. It says it in the Bible, and that's what most, if not all, Christians believe. If a Christian were to hate someone of Hebrew descent or of the Jewish religion, they wouldbe, like Ebert said, violating their own belief system.      Despite some wonderful cinematic aspects of the film, great acting and obvious emotional power, I truly believe Gibson failed in attempting to make 'The Passion' universal. Sometimes, there was a bit too much violence. I really wished he hadn't focused on the beating as much as the beautifully filmed flashbacks, which could have given people who were unfamiliar with the subject matter a better understanding of why there was a purpose for this violence, and why there was so much of it, and why Jesus was so fiercely accused of blasphomy, the politics, etc. It would have continued to illuminate His influence on His people and family, as well.      Although the violence is disappointingly distracting from the overall messege, I do not hesitate to call it a work of art; technically, it is perfect. Also, a film that caused as much conversation about world issues as it did, well, it can't be thrown away as a failure or unimportant, in my eyes. It was not pornographic, either. Its violence served a purpose, and I think Gibson followed through with what he was trying to convey with what I think is one of the better films of the year. I was nearly brought to tears countless times. This is not to be missed. You may hate it, you may be on the fence, or you may love it, but there is no doubt that this is the most unavoidably visceral work in cinema since Lars von Trier's 'Dancer in the Dark.'
B000001EXR|1.0|TERRIBLE,i mean just look at the cover that's more than enough proof this band couldn't care less.
B000268QB2|5.0|While I can see why Keane has been compared so often to Coldplay I'd have to say that only perhaps at a first surface listen are they really alike.  Keane delves more into lush multi textured soundscapes than Coldplay, your hear something new in each song, with every listen.  The vocals remind me of the group Mansun more than anything, perhaps with a bit of Thom Yorke thrown in.  His voice has a certain liliting quality that Chris Martin lacks to me.   <br /> <br />The album is very solid.  I usually skip around a lot when listening to something in the car.  This I can listen to all the way through, over and over.  It's a beautiful album in every way.
B00002Z88D|1.0|No real metal band would even consider playing with a SYMPATHY ORCHESTRA even if it was offered to them for FREE.This proves Metallica have hit an all time low.
0312995423|1.0|The book should appeal to those who know nothing, or very little about technology. However, those people will also notice that the characters, at time, go out of their way to get themselves into trouble, rather than doing the logical thing.      The characters often find themselves puzzled over trivial problems, which the reader figures out a few chapters beforehand. Likewise, there are lengthy conversations, spawning many pages, about such important matters such as whether to phone someone or not.      Dan Brown's style of dragging out a simple story does cause some headaches, especially if there is a chapter break and a &quot;now, back at the ranch&quot; style switches common to soap operas at virtually every chapter. With over 100 chapters, you have lots of switches.      The ending, which I won't go into too much detail in case   someone still wishes to buy this book, will make you weep; You will weep for the time you wasted reading this book.      As a summary, if you believe at what the president has been saying, you will find this book of value.
B000002H6C|3.0|This is no good at all.The songs are long and boring even pointless to be more specific.'One' is a STUNNER and is the only REASON why you should buy this album.
0805076476|5.0|Whether or not you've seen the movie this book is a must read. No bull it'll change your life and so reflects what angst some people feel about modern day society.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I spend far too much time reading the news online, especially the foreign press, so I wasn't shocked or suprised by the film.  In fact, I was very moved by it in many ways.  I felt frustrated that the American people choose to overlook so much and give our trust so freely.  You can't dispute the footage - It's real.  Bush's actual documented actions do more to undermine his credibility than Michael Moore ever could make up.  One thing that can't be disputed, Michael Moore is a TRUE PATRIOT, his love for America shines through!
B000002AP1|5.0|This is an easy one.  Simply the most fercious album ever made.  If I had to throw all my music in the trash, save one CD, this is what I'd choose to keep.  The greatest music ever made!
B00013F38K|5.0|I was a huge fan of this show as a kid. But watching this series again as an adult, I find it unbelievable that it came out (and was quite popular) during the Nixon administration. It presents such great values as fighting (fiercely) only in self-defense, helping your brother (or sister) no matter who they are or where they come from, and always trying to do the right thing for the right reasons. Much of the wisdom imparted by Master Kan and Master Po must have gone right over the heads of the early '70s audience, but what these masters say--when you really think about it--makes important sense today.  <br /> Much has been made by other reviewers about the change of the aspect ratio from full-frame TV to a kind of &quot;pseudo-widescreen&quot;. I was aware of these complaints, but I myself never noticed any problems with the picture. The transfer is actually quite beautiful and does a great honor to a TV show of this era. David Carradine, despite his lack of Asian heritage, is perfect in this role (Caine is really only half-Chinese), and he treats this part with the profound respect it deserves. I am a huge martial arts buff, and I think this series represents the spirit of the arts better than ANY other film or TV depiction. It was what inspired my own study and enjoyment of Asian fighting arts.
B0000CFW87|5.0|There is something so relaxing and special about having this cd on. It is so classy and beautiful. I have been doing singing lessons on CD, &quot;Voice Lessons To GO&quot; by Vaccarino in order to sing along to albums like these.
0786852550|5.0|I was completely taken by this book.  I like Harry Potter and all, but its nice to read a novel where the main Wizard/Magician isn't consisting fighting the same evil, but a diffrent evil.  Bartimis is the demon that has been summoned by Nathaniel, a younge apprentice, to which his Master, Underwood thinks he is an underdog.  After being humilated by Simon Lovelace, Nathaniel decided to up his education, and seek revenge upon Simon.  To do this, he summons Bartimis.  Bartimis is summond to steal Simons precoius Amalut (which this isn't an easy task).  However, the story unfolds to reveal that Simon has the intetion of using the Amalut for evil.  But Nathanel steps up to the plate and outwits and proves his ambtion, and his place in society.  Together, Nathaniel and Bartimis learn they have to become a team.  A brillant novel!  I'm looking forward to the sequal...their team work is phenomenal!! <br /> <br />I would say I couldn't put the book down.  But from the wondering mind of each character, my attention span was cut short.  But it was great!  Just do not space out between characters! :-)  Beautifully written, and it wasn't HP!!  Two thumbs and a pat on the back for Mr. Stroud!
B000002U82|5.0|Undeniably one of the best and most influential albums ever made. Taking the extended instrumental experimentations of their post-Syd days and compacting them into proper songs, the Floyd, semi-unknowingly, created their masterpiece. This is the supreme concept album (Sgt. Pepper's was hardly even one at all), spinning a yarn that cleverly shifts from 2nd person, to a transitory &quot;we,&quot; and finally to a harrowing 1st person. As you listen, you can almost feel the attacks of routine life drive you insane. Musically, albums don't come better conceived. It is as compact as it is unrushed, and the flawless production allows only one break- the one where you flip the album over. Every other transition between rock classics is filled by clever chord progressions, well timed sonic explorations, and, very creepily, a faint background of laughing and talking that gives a voice to the madness that haunts every track. And for all its overall qualities, the individual tracks are equally impressive. The guitar solo in &quot;Time,&quot; particularly the shattering descent from the second highest note on the guitar down, can make you truly afraid. As usual, and as was to be proved undeniably in masterpieces like &quot;Comfortably Numb,&quot; the playing off of Gilmour's and Waters's voices is unparalleled in psychological effect. &quot;Money,&quot; of course, stands as a wonderful single, but if there's any complaint I have about the album, it's that the very personal blues beat stands somewhat at odds with the impersonality of the madness theme. But, with Alan Parsons at the helm, even this is concealed. All in all, it's one of the greatest ever, and, just like Sgt. Pepper's before, it, made anything possible and was an undeniable high point in the history of music.
B00007KWHG|5.0|This CD has all of my favorite Four Seasons hits of the early '60's, which was when I became a big fan, plus the hits from later on. I've always been mainly a classical music guy, and back then I wasn't much into pop. In fact, the only times I heard it were when someone else had a radio on. I never knew what I was hearing, but a few of those songs that came out of the radio really \\"grabbed\\" me, and I would go around humming them. And then I found out that they were ALL by the Four Seasons!     What was it that made those Four Seasons songs so appealing to a classical music guy? Well, there are a lot of things   --   the distinctive style, the clean classical harmonies (although with occasional audacious modulations into new keys), the crisp rhythms, the precise execution, and the great shaping of each phrase and of the larger whole.      The Four Seasons are simply timeless, and to me they're a true crossover. It's great that their old hits are being reissued in these collections.
B0001XAPX8|3.0|The Human Stain is one of those movies that seems to be self consciously striving for Oscar nominations. It features an all star cast, lots of tragedy and melodrama and weighty social issues involving race. Furthermore, it utilizes the overused technique of jumping back and forth in time, which in the case of the aging protagonist (played by Anthony Hopkins), means quite a few decades and allows for a large dose of nostalgia (accompanied by old songs of course) to be thrown into the mix. If this sounds like a cynical view of the movie, it's because the elements never really cohere. Hopkins, as always, gives a good performance, and Nicole Kidman and Gary Sinese are fine in supporting roles, but the plot, taken from a novel by Philip Roth, is meandering and top-heavy and it's hard to find a focal point.<br /><br /> Hopkins plays Coleman Silk, a Classics professor who resigns his position over a controversy involving race. Soon after, his wife dies, from causes apparently related to the stress of the situation. Coleman then meets the narrator of the tale, a writer played by Sinese, whose role is mainly to observe. Coleman begins an affair with a troubled younger woman (Kidman), whose life contains a laundry list of tragic elements, including a psychotic ex-husband who is stalking her.<br /><br /> There's one primary &quot;secret&quot; that is central to the film; although it's been fairly well publicized, I prefer not to divulge it here. I will say, however, that it does not go well with the casting and further strains the viewer's credulity. The Human Stain is a film with several interesting characters, some good scenes but an excess of melodrama and plot points.
B00012FXAE|4.0|I don't normally care for sequels, but the few exceptions I find are in the sci-fi genre. Then again this is almost not a sequel. Yes Cameron uses many of the invidious topos from the original, but they are desparate enough in approach to make the link between the two almost circumstantial. Where &quot;Alien&quot; was primarily a psychological horror film (complete with underlying mysogamy and rape symbolism), &quot;Aliens&quot; is an action-packed, in your face, frenzy. This inverse structure was very prescient on Cameron's part. He took a good tale of terror, a vile, redoubtable villain and really shook up the mix. And by adding more creatures he increases the horror expotentially. <br />  <br /> He did keep one aspect of the precursor in tact, as well he should have: Changes in technology are present with futuristic equipment, but the characters stay very human (the Marines talk like Marines, corporate greed subverts survival, etc). Also there is some clever dialogue. My two favorites: Newt ominously stating &quot;They mostly come out at night...mostly&quot; and Bill Paxton (perfect in his comic relief assignment) telling Paul Reiser, &quot;Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events but we just got out asses kicked&quot;. <br />
B00003CXFV|5.0|The year of 2000 belonged to Steven Soderbergh, directing two of the year's best films, this and &quot;Traffic&quot; (the year's BEST). &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; partially served as a foreshadowing of &quot;Traffic&quot; through its vivid and bumptious style, utilizing different color tints and handheld cinematography. However, its main glory is obvious: Julia Roberts. <br />  <br /> With her impudent, dauntless and saucy performance, the character of Erin Brockovich perfectly mirrored Soderbergh's style of filmmaking. Susannah Grant's screenplay contained impeccable lines to quote, ranging from, &quot;They're called boobs, Ed,&quot; to, &quot;Bite my ass, Krispy Kreme.&quot; Roberts pulled it off graciously and unflinchingly, finally winning the Oscar on her third try. <br />  <br /> And, while there may or may not have been a boost in sales of actual Krispy Kremes from that now-famous quotation, the true Krispy Kreme of the film is certainly Roberts, without whom Soderbergh's film would have been bland, tedious and ultimately unmakeable, although Soderbergh could certainly have come up with another brilliant film on the flip of a dime. <br />  <br /> The point is, Krispy Kremes have new meaning, and as such, Julia Roberts can tell anyone to bite her ass.
B000055Y0X|5.0|The iconic image of Slim Pickens riding that nuclear bomb like a rodeo bull is one of the most trenchant scenes in movie history. It perfectly captures both the madness of the Cold War and the essence of the film. This is the defenitive black comedy with quirky dialouge, bizaree characters, and classic characters. Kubrick had a vision for this work and he was able to capture it nicely. Defenitely in my Top 20 all time.  <br />
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a great film to watch alone; that is an excellent way to promote your utmost attention toward it.  It seems that many people despise this film, claiming that it makes no sense.  The best way to understand it is to pay complete attention to it so as to absorb its sparse dialogue.  Sofia Coppola's screenplay, which rightly won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, geniously integrates two people into a relationship who are not only alienated in the location they are in, but they are also alienated from their families. <br /> <br />Only by understanding more than just the few lines spoken but also the subtle body language and facial expressions can the full message of the movie be grasped.  By doing this, you, as was I, will be fully engaged in this wonderfully subtle, oft humorous and emotional film, the best of 2003.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Sometimes it's not simply that a movie is great, it's also the memories that surround the first time you watched it. For me one of those great reminisces is when my older brother Rick took me to see `Jaws' in the summer of 1975. This was a big deal to an eleven-year-old kid. I doubt if he remembers, but I always will. Just like I'll remember how I wouldn't swim in the neighborhood pool for the rest of that summer after watching this Spielberg classic. <br /> <br />I also recall the precedence that this film set in the horror genre by opening the movie with a scene in which the monster claims a victim. This was such a revelation that I remember telling a friend about the movie and he was totally aghast at such an iconoclastic beginning. `You can't do that' he exclaimed, `you have to have clues leading up to creature, then something happens!' Even at that age I realized that this was shaking things up. Soon a slew of nature vs. man flicks inundated the market and each had a creature (be it grizzly bear, piranha, etc) start the movie off with a violent episode. <br /> <br />Of course this is a fantastic scare-flick, but the reason it has stood the test of time (and the shame of ersatz sequels) is that is more than a frightening movie. The dialogue is smart and the characters are interesting and very well developed. From the central troika of Brody, Hooper and Quint to lesser characters such as the chief's wife and the mayor the players satisfy and represent what we want them to. Not to mention the clever nuances (during the scar-comparing badinage Brody slightly lifts his shirt and glances at a scar that you can tell he wants to mention, but obviously decides not to-and this leaves the moment more fulfilling by what is not said) and the side bars (the implied conflict between Brody and his wife and their current residence, the disparity between Hooper and Quint, etc) that add verisimilitude to the work. Also adroitly included are adumbrations such as the `Welcome to Amity' sign, and Quint sailing by with a large grin as the fisherman hang the tiger shark up thinking they have caught the beast in question (we share this irony with Quint and it's very enjoyable) as well as quick scenes (the overweight lady heading into the water) that we like as we watch the movie but don't remember when later on we try to explain why we like this film so much.  <br />
B000059H98|1.0|Title says it all.       First off, I'm a big Tank Girl fan, I know the comic's ADD-style lunatic writing, and I knew from the beginning not to expect some life-changing epiphany to arise from my viewing this movie. Unfortunately, despite my expectations being meager at best, I was still let down. For one thing, there's a coherent (muddled, but coherent) relatively straightforward storyline, something that NEVER happened in the comics.       For another thing, the Tank Girl I knew an loved was a cranky, amoral psychopath (British/Australian). She didn't have a concious, she killed people that annoyed her and indulged in all manner of demented fun. Meanwhile, Movie Tank Girl sounds like she fell out of the Upper East Side, a gun-toting tease with a heart of gold that makes one-liners borrowed straight from TMNT.       The movie takes itself too seriously to capture the outrageous fun of the comic (the violence and language is incredibly tepid), and instead tries to disguise directionless writing as camp.      The art of Jamie Hewlitt is present throughout various points in the film and is (as always) stunning (they often take the place of sets or transition scenes as there obviously wasn't money in the budget for them), but seems out of place. The bizarre world inside Jamie Hewlitt's head is poorly realized on the live-action sequences and makes the quick cuts from comic art to live action jarring. The animation sequences are nicely done and kind of make me wonder why they didn't just make the whole movie animated?       I didn't enjoy Tank Girl at all, I ended up just fast forwarding through 2/3s of the movie because I just couldn't take it anymore. I took it out of the library...which I would reccommend for anyone who shows any interest in viewing it (it's barely worth rental money).      Pros:   -Hewlitt's art is awesome   -Animation sequences are fun and well-done   -Ice-T dressed up as a kangaroo      Cons:    -Everything else.      If you do end up getting it and watching it, I would reccommend, beforehand, either getting stoned or consuming a large amount of alcohol. I did neither, and I think if I had I would've enjoyed it more.
0790731509|5.0|One of the reasons that the late 60s/early 70s was such a powerful era in filmmaking is the emergence of the anti-hero (defined as an individual with heroic qualities, but not in a position we would usually find a hero). This is symbolized greatly in `Cool Hand Luke'. We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours. It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on `Alien') live vicariously through him. <br /> <br />Filled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, `shakin' it here boss', the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history's most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic. Released the same year as `Bonnie and Clyde', it makes one long for the days when you needed a real script to make a movie.  <br />
B00000DOYR|5.0|i am just a kid and wasn't even close to being born when this cd came out. in spite of that, kids at my school listen and talk about acdc all the time. at one point i didn't know why because i thought that acdc was just screaming. their first 9 cds were great good quality music but i think that the back in black cd made them what they are today: GODS. on most cds that you buy, there is going to be atleast one song that you're just not gonna like but on this there aren't any. <br />  <br /> here are my ratings of the songs: <br />  <br /> hells bells: the intro is too long but once you finally get the song its fast and loud like any good song is. great melody too. 9.5/10 <br />  <br /> shoot to thrill: the intro to this song is the best bit of music i have ever heard. the song after the intro is also awesome and like the first song, it has an OUTSTANDING melody and is nice and fast. my favorite song on the cd. 10/10 <br />  <br /> what do you do for money honey: great song but sounds too much like shoot to thrill. 8.5/10 <br />  <br /> given a dog a bone: great, fast, upbeat melody. the chorus sounds really good. 9/10 <br />  <br /> let me put love into you: proof that an acdc song doesn't have to be fast to be good. its a nice song to listen to even though its not real catchy. 8/10 <br />  <br /> back in black: ever since i was seven or so i always wondered what that duh duhduhduh duhduhduh (chords:F DDD AAA) melody was. when i bought this cd i found out. i really like the guitar solo about halfway through the song. after listening to the first few seconds i found out why it is the namesake for the album. 10/10 <br />  <br /> you shook me all night long: anyone around in the 80's probably knows about this song. hell, even my dad does. the guitar in this song is great but they really keep playing the same 2 chords over and over. good song though.8.5/10 <br />  <br /> have a drink on me: a song i am banging my head to as i write. great guitar playing. it sounds great.i still don't understand why you would write a song about being in a bar. ahhh who cares. 9.5/10 <br />  <br /> shake a leg: this song, like beer, is an aquired taste. after listening to it about six or seven times you learn to love it. good beat and fast paced. awesome song. 9.5/10 <br />  <br /> rock and roll ain't noise pollution: there really much to say about this song. i really can't describe it. its different but it has a great beat. i love the lyrics. 9.5/10 <br />  <br /> too bad bon scott(original singer for acdc) just missed the chance to record this album by about a month or so because it rocks. &quot;rock and roll will survive&quot;.
B000059H99|5.0|The sequels (though at times entertaining) to this movie, along with the coterminous &quot;Rambo&quot; series, almost made this crtitcally acclaimed, truly great film, a joke. They also nearly ruined the premise of this original, that of a middling fighter, albeit with voluminious heart, who takes his one shot at glory and catches a much more talented man off gaurd. In the subsequent movies Balboa becomes a &quot;great&quot; boxer, and we lose one of the most endearing characters in film history. This egregious example confirms that sequels are self-serving and spoil the imagination of viewers of the orginal work. <br />  <br /> The main reason that this work is so moving is the character development of the title character. From his inept attempts at loanshark enforcement and romance, to his moments alone in his seedy apartment staring in the mirror, talking to his pets, to the advice given to the young girl, we find this man of violence very appealing. His development (and pari passu transformation of Adrian-played brilliantly by Shire) culminates in the poignant moment when he reveals to Adrain that though he knows he cannot win, if he can just go the distance he'll know that he wasn't &quot;just another bum from the neighborhood&quot;. And go the distance he does--in one of the greatest fight sequences ever made. <br />  <br /> Other plusses: The inspiring theme song which swells perfectly as he accends the steps, the interesting love story, and the fabulous acting of Shire, Young, Weathers and Meredith. <br />  <br /> A great film.  <br />
B00000DHRZ|5.0|when i first put americana into my cd player i thought how could i have lived without this band throughout my life. i especially like pretty fly for a white guy. like many of the kids at my school, this song is about those stupid, upper middle class, white posers who run around in clothing that rappers wear and call eachother nigre. it is probably the funniest offspring song ever. other songs like starin at the sun, have you ever, the kids arent alright, and walla walla to name afew make this cd one of the best cds ever. call it pop/punk, too soft, or mtv but this cd kicks a**. i dont care how you look at it but if you like any of the offsprings other albums then buy this one. you wont be disappointed. welcome to americana.     I WROTE THIS SAME REVIEW UNDER THE KID THING I AM NOT COPYING!
B00003CX95|5.0|A remarkable film in which I can watch several times without faltering. I am as much a lover of history as I am of film and literature, so I must acknowledge that this film is loosely based on the life of Wallace and does fall short in numerous instances to historical verity. That said it remains a stunning achievement in film work that liberally reconstructions actual events in order to present a gripping modern epic. <br /> <br />The entire movie is engaging but two scenes stand out: The `gift of the thistle' moment when the beautiful young Murron presents the young Wallace with a wildflower at his father's funeral. Few tableaus in film history can match the power here as the music swells in harmony with touching scene. The tremendous Stirling battle scene (though vastly historically inaccurate) is also a piece de resistance, from Wallace's rousing speech to his contempt for the English commander, from the comic relief of the mooning and flashing of the recalcitrant Scots and finally the riveting battle itself (that may only possibly be rivaled by Saving Private Ryan's D-Day landing sequence for sheer power in a battle scene). It's also notable that the script and Gibson's direction provide for a juxtaposition of this violence with the soothing powers of femininity; the bride who eases her husband's wrath sotto voce and gently pushes the adversaries blade from his throat, the lure of a life with Murron in which Wallace initially attempts to stay clear of war and the obvious benevolence of the princess. <br /> <br />This movie is a great one and without a doubt in my top ten. <br />
0553274503|5.0|Charlie knows he's not smart and when he's offered a chance to become smart through an experimental surgical procedure, he readily accepts. His intelligence level quickly increases, and with it, the complexity of his life. Unfortunately, the effects of the surgery are only temporary, and Charlie is doomed to lose all that he has gained.<br /><br /> This book chronicles Charlie's experiences in journal form. As Charlie's intelligence improves, the grammar and spelling improve and we can feel him getting smarter. Unfortunately, with intelligence comes the painful understanding that his old &quot;friends&quot; routinely had fun at Charlie's expense. And as Charlie realizes that he is going to return to his original intelligence level, we have to ask ourselves whether Charlie's brief brush with understanding was worth the cost.<br /><br /> This is an powerful and touching story about the desire for knowledge and understanding, and a reminder that they don't always bring happiness.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Next to `The Godfather' this is probably the best picture to come out of the great era in American filmmaking, the late 60s early 70s. This movie has it all: a great story, superb acting, wonderful comedic moments, clever dialogue and fantastic character development. Also timeless scenes pervade such as `no rules in a knife fight', the undressing scene when Katherine Ross's character is first introduced, the cliff jump and of course the fabulous ending in which director George Roy Hill stops the film but lets the sound continue thus revealing the pair's fate, but saving the audience the sadness of seeing it. It is a perfect compromise. The interaction between Newman and Redford is as memorable as it is amusing. One of the ten best movies ever! <br />
0393316041|4.0|Mr. Feynman's career as a physicist was remarkable, including highlights such as the Manhattan Project and the inquiry into the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster.  This collection of anecdotes gives us a look at another side of this distinguished scientist.  Here we find an irreverent person, who enjoyed practical jokes and loved to explore interests beyond science.  Many of these stories are extremely funny, while others are thought provoking.  If there is lesson here, it is that we should live our lives like explorers, always pushing the limits of our experience and never afraid to take chances.
B0000399WI|5.0|This outstanding work is coterminous with films like `The Longest Yard' and `Cool Hand Luke' in that it touches upon our ambivalence about prison inmates. It is indicative of the dichotomous view that our society has in regard to the penal system when we can clarion lex talions among our fellow citizens yet identify with and cheer on movie criminals in theatres. Quite possibly it is the underlying threat of being immured ourselves, as we realize that it is really a fine line that keeps us free. <br /> <br />Of course it takes more than a play on our hidden fears to produce a film this good. It takes a good script, solid acting and characters that we can give a damn about, all of which are gathered here brilliantly. Above all it takes a good story, and obviously Frank Darabont knew one when he adapted this Stephen King novella into a movie script (you never really can tell what you will end up with when you endeavor to bring one of King's books to the big screen). He also knows how to use a camera to draw us into the prison world and how to exploit the power of narration (assisted nicely by the warm voice and splendid diction of Freeman). <br /> <br />SPOLIER ALERT!!! A truly great movie must have a truly great ending and this film actually has two. They could have ended it right after revealing the circumstances surrounding the escape as Freeman explains that he just misses his friend and it would have been fitting, but they continued and finish with a fabulous moment on the beach as Freeman succinctly explains in a voice over, `I hope'. For those of you who try to say that you could see the end coming a mile away---forget it; sell it to someone who's buying.  <br />

B0001I55SS|3.0|The Black Hole isn't the best sci fi film ever made.  I don't even know if its in the top ten.  But there is just something about it that I love.  Maybe it's because it's a throw back to the sci fi films of the 50s.  Maybe because the effects are top notch.  Maybe because that space station looks so damn cool!  I'm not sure what it is, but the film is fun.  There are major plot holes, bad dialogue and an ending that really doesn't make much sense.  Let alone the fact that physics really don't mean anything in the world of The Black Hole.  It's funny to think this film came out 4 years after Star Wars and 10 years after Kubrick's 2001.   <br /> <br />Disney's release has little differences from the Anchor Bay release of a few years ago.  There is no pan and scan on this version, but it is anamorphic.  The overture is still present, although the a title card replaces the star-scape.  There is also a documentary on the making of the film. <br /> <br />This film is for kids and the kid at heart.  And like I said before, it's just a fun film that very cool to look at.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|I have seen alot of films - I have seen the best and the worst that Hollywood has to offer.Darren Aronofsky floored me with PI but that was an original screenplay and a screenplay based on a novel written years ago didn`t sound very appealing to me but then I caught the film Last Exit to Brooklyn - another Selby novel - and I figured if that film was such a wild experience,I would give Requiem For a Dream a shot. <br />I have to say that anything you have heard about this film is all subject to the person seeing it and what they`re outlook on drugs is.This film is at the very least a dark,relentless and at times painful film to watch....and that is why it is such an outstanding film.Most people have no experiences to compare it to and that is why some will say it`s not that great...and that is a shame.Everyone is accountable in the end and there is no happy ending....not really.  <br />Every actor is perfectly cast and Ellen Byrstyn deserved an Oscar nomination for her intense and thoughtful portrayal of the lonely widow who unwittingly becomes addicted to speed with nightmarish results. <br />Darren Aronofsky is really gonna have to pull of something really big to top this and you know what?.........I can`t wait. <br />An excellent film.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I LOVE this CD!  I know it's terrible to admit, since I'm one of those pretentious emo-listening fools.  But, what the hell.  This CD is catchy and melodic.

B000002L7R|5.0|I was 15 years old when this eclectic album was released. Being a devout Prince disciple since 1979's \\"Prince\\" album up to his funk/rock masterpiece \\"Purple Rain\\", I had yet to hear a bad Prince (and The Revolution) album. His albums were filled with a radical blend of dancable funk, smoldering rock, and sexuality (my mother somehow approved of me listening to it). As an impressionable adolescent, I respected Prince immensely because 1. He was totally original and 2. He was Prince!<br /> But then came 1985 and \\"Around The World In A Day\\", an album that both mesmerized and baffled me. Not too hip to 60's music at the time, I was not prepared for this (no one was). My sister had it on vinyl and she didn't like it so she gave it to me. I remember playing this album all the way through for the first time while reading the lyrics inside the cover and how stunned I was afterwards.<br /><br /> AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAY: Listening to this track, I felt like a gate to a whole new world (musically) was being opened before me. I still get that feeling when I listen to it now.<br /><br /> PAISLEY PARK: The second stop on this trippy journey. This was a place anyone could go when life became too hard or painful - as it is in this day and age.<br /><br /> CONDITION OF THE HEART: A orchestration that tells of a lonely man who wears his heart on his sleeve.<br /><br /> RASPBERRY BERET: A happy tune laced with strings about a young man losing his virginity in Old Man Johnson's barn.<br /><br /> TAMBORINE: In this funky drum/bass cut, tamborine could represent anything that makes one feel good. Period.<br /><br /> AMERICA: Prince makes his political statements in the form of a (funky) anthem.<br /><br /> POP LIFE: The message: Even for the biggest star, everything that glitters isn't gold.<br /><br /> THE LADDER: A touch of the gospel. The message and the music makes me want to walk slowly down the altar of a church and repent of my sins.<br /><br /> TEMPTATION: This is what happens when sexual lust takes you over and what you could face afterwards.

B00003CXCT|2.0|I just read about some MORE changes Lucas has made to these 3 DVDs....while I enjoyed the special editions and really only felt that having Greedo shoot first was pretty stupid considering it lessens Han evolution from scoundral to hero it was relatively minor.  <br />BUT NOW: <br />1. Hayden Christienson's face will CGI'd over Sebastion Shaw's face in Jedi for the Darth Vader death Scene? I have no problem with Hayden..I actually like his Annakin but that is just so damn stupid! The scene is fine leave it alone! <br /> <br />2.Ian Mcdiarmid will be replacing Clive Revill as the Emperor in Empire Strikes back. How silly is that not only does it not make a difference as it is one scene but why waste the time and money to do so? <br /> <br />George Lucas' new changes reminds of when I was a kid and would try to rework some of my artwork after I had already finished it cause I just didn't like this little thing or that..until I finally wore a hole in the picture and it was not any good anymore. <br />I am soo not a fanatic about this stuff I love the prequels films..not as much as the original films but I do love them. But it just feels like one of these days George is just going to remake the entire films get new actors and just redo the whole damn first trilogy..can you picture it? <br />Leonardo Decaprio as Luke <br />Brad Pitt as Han Solo (Or Orlando Bloom) <br />Kira Knightly or Kirsten Dunst as Princess Leia... <br />Not that I dislike any of these actors but could you really see them as these characters.... <br />Sigh I am sooooo disapointed that the joy of these films I had for so many years is being disregarded by Mr. Lucas that he thinks the films are of such poor quality that he needs to keep tinkering with them until the do not resemble the originals at all. I am very sad and disapointed and now I think I've finally lost my patience with this DVD set and will not be buying it....I have a good widescreen undoctored set of the original films on VHS and I think I will just stick to those. <br />
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|As I read reviews for this cd, I have one ? Did you buy this cd not knowing what you were getting and ignored the parental advisory/explict content sticker? I mean this is a very good cd, you just have to like rap and not mind the cursing. I loved this cd when I bought it, the best investment of money that I ever spent. Dont be fooled by the reviews in here saying oh this is bad, and other such nonsense. This is a must for a true lover of rap, there are many songs that are very good on it, and if you actually listened to many of Eminems cds you realize that D12 was in a number of his songs. So dont be fooled by reviews that in most cases the person has never listened to the cd. This is a great cd only if your a fan of rap and Eminem, it is the perfect cd for the collection.
B00000099Y|5.0|If anyone could possibly listen to the deep, meaningfull lyrics to this disc with the addition of the amazing instruments and say that it is bad, I would like to see it. Even though the songs that are &quot;popular&quot; are amazing in their own right, make sure you take a look at the last two full songs on the disc, &quot;Aenima&quot; and &quot;Third Eye.&quot; These two sum up the band's vision clearly. If you think that this music is not for you, buy this cd anyway and listen to Third Eye in a darkened room surrounded by candles and burning inscence and you will see what I mean. <br /> Thank you
B0002KVUKM|5.0|In 1999 director Steven Sommers presented the hit movie THE MUMMY to movie audiences (which opened to an amazing weekend take of $43 million May 7th). With so much success a sequel THE MUMMY RETURNS (2001) was inevitable.<br />Sommers, a big fan of the classic Universal monster/horror movies made the movie as a homage to the earlier Universal movies and in 2004 he paid tribute to the other staples of the genre -Wolfman, Dracula and Frankenstein's monster - all in one movie. The movie VAN HELSING even had Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde in a cameo role at the outset of the movie fighting famed monster hunter Van Helsing - portrayed by Hollywood star Hugh Jackman.<br />Ignore what you may have read or heard about the movie, it's a thrill ride of a rollercoaster of a movie that owes more than a tip of the hat to both the Indiana Jones and James Bond franchises. The movie never lets up, traveling along at breakneck speed right to its tumultuous, suspenseful, wrist-clenching climax.<br />The movie opens in 1887 and follows legendary vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing as he travels to the mysterious land of Transylvannia - home to his most famed opponent Count Dracula and a land that has been overrun by werewolves and vampires.<br />Prior to his departure we have a scene unabashedly influenced by the Q-scenes from the James Bond series. Equipped with such `futuristic' weaponry and gadgets as an automatic `machine gun' style crossbow, Van Helsing, with comic relief Carl (played by David Wenham) as his bumbling assistant in tow, heads to investigate the reports coming out of eastern Europe.<br />Upon arrival Van Helsing meets Anna Valerious (played by the impossibly gorgeous Kate Beckinsale). Valerious is the last member of a family that is under a curse that can only be broken by the death of Dracula. After some initial mistrust Valerious realizes that Van Helsing shares her goal of defeating the evil count and the two enter into an alliance.<br />I admit that my initial interest in the movie was sparked by the involvement of Beckinsale. A fan of the British actress since I noticed her alongside Clare Danes in BROKEDOWN PALACE, I have enjoyed a number of her movies (SEREDIPITY and UNDERWORLD) and had to endure some terrible movies (PEARL HARBOR and TIPTOES). Thankfully VAN HELSING falls squarely in the positive column and ranks unquestionably as my favorite Beckinsale movie to date. She gives an excellent and stirring performance as a determined fighter of the monsters that inhabit her land.<br />Opposing Van Helsing, Carl and Valerious is one of the all-time best screen portrayals of Dracula in Richard Roxburgh. Roxburgh is simply superb and steals every scene he is in with his deliciously evil rockstar take on the character. Aiding Dracula are his three vampire brides (Josie Maran, Silvia Colloca and Elena Anaya) who fly around the country doing his bidding - the interplay between the three I found to be constantly entertaining. Also under the spell of the count is Wolf man (Will Kemp), a character Van Helsing has sworn to kill, but one which causes some emotional drama for Valerious and an interesting subplot for the movie.<br />With a budget of $148 million, Universal really threw a lot of effort into this movie and it shows. A total of 980 special effects accompanies some well honed action scenes, amazing stunts and sumptious costume design in a movie that really delivers the goods. It's an incredible trip that will leave you breathless until the end credits roll.<br />This movie was criticized widely for its improbable script. Yes, it's a B-movie script but then it is supposed to be. It's a homage to the black and white Universal classics. That's what you go expecting to see, only with updated special effects and a larger budget. In those respects this movie is a triumph. Sit back and enjoy and remember those wonderful Lon chaney and Bela Lugosi movies of yesteryear. This movie isn't one that works if you try to overthink it. It's fun and played to be fun.<br />Delivering possibly two of their best performances is Jackman and Beckinsale and I really felt a chemistry between the stars, easily more so than Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz in the two MUMMY movies. Sommers sets his story against a spectacular scenic backdrop that worked for me as far more breathtaking than  the desert vistas of Sommers most famous earlier work.<br />VAN HELSING is an achievement and my favorite movie of 2004. I am eagerly awaiting the release of the widescreen anamorphic DVD on Oct. 19 in a release that Universal has understandably seen fit to shower with special features. Including two audio commentaries, a 360-degree tour of Dracula's castle, You are in the Movie, the tantalizingly titled `The Legend of Van Helsing' and (perhaps most enticing) some deleted scenes, October cannot come soon enough.<br />I'm hoping for a VAN HELSING 2, but even if one doesn't get made at least I will have this immensely entertaining movie to enjoy.<br />Well recommended.<br /> Be aware that the studio will also be releasing an Ultimate Edition DVD on the same day. This three-disc set will also include the classic horror movies DRACULA (1931), FRANKENSTEIN (1931) and THE WOLF MAN (1941).<br />Other special features included on the Ultimate Edition are: 'VAN HELSING, THE STORY, THE LIFE THE LEGEND'; 'TRACK THE ADVENTURE: VAN HELSING'S MAP'; 'THE MUSIC OF VAN HELSING' and 'DARKNESS FALLS: DRACULA'S LAIR IS TTRANSFORMED.'<br /> Which ever version you pick up, the regular edition or the Ultimate Edition be assured that you will be well pleased with the movie itself - a must-own!possibly two of their best performances is Jackman and Beckinsale and I really felt a chemistry between the stars, easily more so than Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz in the two MUMMY movies.

B00024I31C|4.0|As the saying goes, &quot;The only things for sure are death and taxes&quot; and the consistent quality of JJ Cale albums. <br /> Sure there are some albums I prefer over others but when I look at my out of 5 ratings for JJ's albums they are all 4 or 5. <br /> Its like going into that same coffee bar because you know damn well that the quality and taste of their coffee is gonna be of the same high standard everyday. <br /> Buy it......you cant go wrong.
B00003TL18|5.0|I don't agree with anybody saying that Roy's voice wasn't as good in 1987 as it had been in the 1960's era. I've listened to some tracks from 'a black and white night live' and compared them to studio originals from the 60's. <br /> <br />I do have to admit that Orbison is indeed sounding somehow more vulnerable in 1987, but the control he has over his voice has probably grown throughout the years. He's still able to reach the highest notes on songs like It's Over, In Dreams and Running Scared.  <br /> <br />In fact, my opinion is that Roy sings even better at this live performance than in the studio's in the 1960's: although it is a live performance, he's still able to reach the high notes pretty easily, while some of his 60's recordings contain parts where he's singing a litte flat on some demanding parts. <br /> <br />The appearance of guest stars only adds to the fun. Also the backing band, which Elvis Presley had been touring with in the 70's, is very much able to set the mood for Roy's songs. I even daresay that this particular backing group sounds even better than the one(s) on Roy's records from the 60's. <br /> <br />I would really want to recommend this live album to any Roy Orbison and/or classic rock 'n roll fan. It's a great effort and performance from a man who was taken away from us too soon. I really miss him.

So well, I like it as all the other albums. :) <br /> <br />But, to make it clear: <br />99% of lrics and music is and was always written by Tuomas Holopainen - on Once: the keyboards, the drums, the guitars and even the symphonic... the vocals and the choir. <br />The brand new symphonic-choir section is one and the same as the one which performed the OST for The Lord of the Rings movie - those, who hate LOTR and the OST hands up! Those who like them and criticize the orchestra and choir of Once shut up! :) <br /> <br />Oh, and don't forget about that Tarja Turunen is a professional opera singress, but on Once she sings in  different style. It was a common choic of Tuomas and Tarja. <br /> <br />Any questions? :)
B000286S8S|1.0|Any casual fan probably bought Best of: Vol. 1 a few years ago only to find that it was missing several of the great tracks played on the radio. The die hards bought that album for the 2 new rushed Roth tracks that were decent but did nothing to add to the original Van Halen legacy. <br />  <br /> Move ahead 8 years and here we have another greatest hits album...odd seeing as the band has only released one album in that 8 years and NONE of the tracks from that album are represented here. Seems odd, too, since Gary Cherone was supposedly EVH's &quot;musical soulmate&quot; without which he vowed to spend the rest of his days playing trombone. It's a slap in the face to Gary not to at least include &quot;Without You&quot; here. <br />  <br /> So anyway, basically what you have here is a band who claims to have written volumes of music in the past 6 years only to release a new hits package with only 3 new tracks. So answer me this, if you're doing this for the casual fans why not release a single disc &quot;Best of Volume 2&quot; with the new Hagar tracks and the rest of the radio tracks you included here? If you're doing this for the die hard fans why insult them by making them buy 2 CDs full of songs they already have for 3 new Hagar tracks that (just like the Roth tracks on BOV1) are decent but do nothing to add to the Van Hagar legacy? If you've written so much music in the past 6 years, why not give us a new album? <br />  <br /> And finally, why the live tracks? They're from a live album that true Hagar fans bought years ago. They feature Hagar on vocals, but they're Roth songs. Wouldn't Hagar fans want to hear Hagar singing Hagar songs? Wouldn't Roth fans want to hear Roth singing Roth songs? So why these tracks? Makes no sense. If you had room for 3 more songs why not give us one of the many radio songs you left off the CD, ie. Mean Street, Atomic Punk, Ice Cream Man, Somebody Get Me a Doctor, Top Jimmy, Drop Dead Legs, Summer Nights, 5150, Cabo Wabo, (Don't Tell Me) What Love Can Do, Amsterdam, etc? <br />  <br /> To make a long story short, lately Van Halen seems to be a band that cares nothing about their fans. Indeed, this CD is packed full of great music, but it is also packed with a lot of bad blood.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|I know Nash from game theory classes, specifically for his most prodigious econometric contribution that's popularly known as Nash Equilibrium, a way of describing how people caught in a strategic decision-making situation may respond based on their assumptions about each others' behaviour.<br /><br />Not only is that pivotal element skipped (except for fine print in the epilogue), casual viewers may also come away thinking that he was some sort of cross between a paranoid pseudo-codebreaker gone awry, and a crazy genius who devised a mathematical approach for picking up women and then forgot all about it.<br /><br />Russel Crowe may have been twice as credible if he didn't struggle to imitate Geoffrey Rush in Shine or Fred Gwynne as one of the Munsters. Well, Ok, I am over-analyzing. Jennifer Connelly does well to potray a doting wife, but the fact that his real-world wife had divorced Nash is totally ignored. For that matter, we're never even told that their son, also an ingenious math whiz and a schizophrenic, suffered as much at the hands of fate and society as his father.<br /><br />Why was a more honest, less Hollywoodized depiction of the mathematician so difficult to manage? None of such facts would have lessened Nash's accomplishment or undermined the originality of his contributions, but their omission suggests that the director was not confident in addressing the audience as grown-ups.<br /><br />If you know little about John Nash -- the troubled, violent, gifted mathematician --  this may come across as a very well made movie, as the numerous accolades it bagged may prove. But the film in its half-baked form is a bit of a gyp for anyone who knows a bit about the man and his much grander complexity. I still give it three stars for holding your attention, but I wonder if anyone would willingly watch it more than once.

B00012QM8G|5.0|This has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. Few movies show you the true horrors of the holocaust as effectively as 'Schindler's List'. You can read about it all you want, but you never really know what it was like. 'Schindler's List' helps you understand a little better. The black-and-white cinematography added to the effect wonderfully.

B00006DEFA|5.0|Simply fantastic. I'm not surprised at all that it one the Oscar for Best Picture (1984) and is included in AFI's Top 100 Films of all time. Even at three hours the music alone is enough to mesmerize you. Add superb acting and a superior story and you have 'Amadeus'. I highly recommend this film.
B00005RFVL|4.0|OK. I didnt even know who Robbie Williams was till I saw De-Lovely (hey, I cant keep up on everything!), but give me credit for spotting a good looking hunk with talent when I see one! I figured I'd check this out first after seeing the movie and its a gas! He covers many of the Rat Pack hits (Sinatra, Dino, Davis, Bobby Darin) and brings it off surprisingly well. You get Porter, Rodgers and Hart, Sammy Cahn, Gerswhin, Weill and many other standards sung with a full orchestra and great arrangements. There are duets with Nicole Kidman (subbing for Nancy on Somethin' Stupid); Jane Horrocks; Jon Lovitz(!);Rupert Everett (LOL! What's going on in this song?) and his flatmate and best mate (??). Even Old Blue Eyes shares some verses with him on It Was A Very Good Year. Only Mr. Bojangles seems a misfire. I give this 4 1/2 stars.  You'll have a great time!

B0002EXH4K|3.0|I bought So far, Peace Sells, and Rust in Peace and This one. I thought the first three needed the remixing and mastering, but this one? I really think Dave messed this one up.

Do your self an favor and don't buy it. I regret it!
B0001XAPX8|4.0|&quot;The Human Stain&quot; is based on the novel of the same name by Philip Roth, which employs the not entirely novel device of seeing through the eyes of a novelist. Gary Sinese plays novelist Nathan Zuckerman, who, after a bestseller and a divorce, has secluded himself in a cabin outside the town of Athena, Massachusetts. He grows close to the newly retired Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins), who has become an outcast of sorts himself, having been forced to retire after 35 years of service as a professor of classics and Dean of Faculty at nearby Athena College. Against the admonitions of friends and colleagues, Coleman has an improbable affair with a much-younger cleaning woman, Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman), which seems even less advisable when her unstable ex-husband (Ed Harris) arrives on the scene.<br /><br /> &quot;The Human Stain&quot; has a deliberately slow pace. It diligently picks its way along. It seemed oppressive for the film's first half-hour, but eventually I was drawn in by the characters. Both Coleman and Faunia's characters are defined by their pasts, ironically, as both have dedicated their lives to putting the past behind them. The mysteries of these pasts are revealed slowly, and that is the means by which the audience is drawn into the story. Both Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman give impressive performances, but the casting is conspicuously odd. Neither of these characters looks his or her part in the least. This doesn't detract from their emotional power, but I have to wonder what the powers that be were thinking when they cast this film. I guess they were thinking that two talented A-list actors could pull anything off. Wentworth Miller is perfectly cast as the younger Coleman Silk. And I was particularly impressed by Anna Deavere Smith as Coleman's wise but heartbroken mother. &quot;The Human Stain&quot; is a nice character drama. It's just not for the impatient.<br /><br /> The DVD: &quot;Behind the Scenes Special&quot; is an 8-minute featurette about making the film that includes interviews with the cast and director Robert Benton. It's not very focused and doesn't say much. &quot;Jean Yves Escoffer Tribute&quot; is a short tribute to cinematographer Jean Yves Escoffer to whom &quot;The Human Stain&quot; has been dedicated.

038551123X|4.0|After reading previous reviews, I was curious to see how a novel of a self-proclaimed serial killer could work. I definitely think it works! Dexter is a very different protagonist, emotionally scarred from childhood and the reason is revealed to us. I do wish the author had delved deeper into Dexter's thought processes and the other characters. I do look forward to the author's next Dexter book.

0802130208|1.0|After having read the onslaught of rave reviews I finally decided it was time to crack the covers of this book. Yes, it won the Pulitzer Prize, but was also rejected by every major publishing house for seven years. After having read extensively such authors as Updike, Bellow, Steinbeck, Vonnegut I must say that I find this book stunning in its mediocrity, painfully boring, and too exaggerated to even pass as social satire. <br /> Someone of Ignatius' intelligence and originality would not be on the social and behavioral level of a three-year-old. To be so perceptive what the world is concerned but to have no inkling of self-awareness is just plain impossible. <br />  <br /> As for being a comic masterpiece, I did not laugh once, it rarely even made me smirk. People who talk of &quot;side-splitting laughter&quot; do not seem to get out of the house much anymore. I probably enjoyed most his pseudo-intellectual indictment of society, although the whole thing is just social commentary in reverse, instead of social progress it advocates a return to theocracy and the Dark Ages, which is potentially interesting at first, but then just became redundant and annoying. <br />  <br /> I enjoyed one person's review in particular calling people who did not see the &quot;genius&quot; in this book the real &quot;Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, but I wonder if the dunces are truly those who cannot think for themselves and just go by the old if-it-got-a-prize-it-must-be-amazing motto. I really have to wonder about this Pulitzer... <br />  <br /> From the first page onward this book is pure drudgery, the dialogue is witty but seems to take place in some kind of void, the characters are somewhat unique but completely flat and predictable. If you want true comic anti-heroes I suggest you read &quot;Pnin&quot; by Vladimir Nabokov, or some other book by a real author.

0446677450|5.0|Several reviews have been conducted regarding this book, and I will try to add in my two cents. Kiyosaki does a masterful job highlighting, if not identifying, the many problems that several in the middle class, rat race trap are faced with. <br />  <br /> Refreshing is the almost simplistic, but tragically overlooked, layout of what constitutes an asset and what determines a liability. Quite simply, the former is what adds to your life or &quot;puts money in you pocket&quot;; the latter is what takes away from the quality of life or &quot;drains money from your pocket&quot;. <br />  <br /> Very frequently presented is the premise that unless you change, you will keep doing what you have always been doing. Though Kiyosaki's subsequent release, Cashflow Quadrant, touches more thoroughly upon the shortcomings of a traditional education, which he says does not equip one with financial intelligence, one overtone does reverberate in Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and it is this. We learn from our mistakes, and perhaps the key reason why people will typically become failures not only in school but in life is that they have become conditioned to fear failure to the degree that they are afraid of making mistakes. So they do not try and, in effect, have already resigned themselves to failure. Mistakes, Kiyosaki points out, are necessary not only for true learning but for any meaningful success. <br />  <br /> As somewhat an autobiography that centers around the contrasting viewpoints that Kiyosaki, throughout his boyhood and adult years, received from two different adults, one wealthy and the other middle class, Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a very thorough personification of the habits of mind that separate those who have more from those who have less or none. <br />  <br /> Kiyosaki does point to other recommended readings that are compatible with his works. From a historical perspective on wealth, Kiyosaki recommends Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith (the cornerstone of economics), and for those who want inspiration and encouragement, Kiyosaki also recommends Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. <br />  <br /> Also as one of my personal recommended readings for the pathway to success is the essential How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life by Alan Lakein, which effectively lays out the remedy to the 20/80----80/20 dilemma we are oftentimes faced with.  <br />  <br /> Combined with these other books and the like, Rich Dad, Poor Dad will be an effective tool for learning how to prioritize not only financial matters but life matters. A truly winning combination awaits you.

B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie was powerful. I feel not only did Mel do a great job as a director, but the actors were wonderful, especially Jim Caviezel. The actor that plays Marie was even better she made me feel her pain.  The movie to me was hard to take, but I believe it was important that I see movie and judge it for myself. But I also feel that adults should watch the movie before we the children see it.  And explain to them what they will see in the movie. Our children should decided if they want to go through these different emotions. <br /> <br />I hope everyone sees this movie and Judges it for themselves. Enjoy and god bless.
B00000E2VC|5.0|This is one of the most sublime Chopin recordings. I won't repeat all that the previous Amazon reviewers have written about its beauty, depth, and nobility, but would only suggest that you forget the caricature of Michelangeli drawn by many critics. For instance, the late Harold Schonberg -- while conceding that Michelangeli played \\"Gaspard\\" magnificently -- wrote, \\"in many pieces of the romantic repertoire he seems unsure of himself emotionally, and his otherwise direct playing is then laden with expressive devices that disturb the musical flow.\\" This from a man who believed the cynically manipulative Josef Hofmann represented \\"perfection plus.\\" For a resounding refutation of Schonberg I urge you to hear this disc, starting with the Op. 45 Prelude. And, as if it were needed, for further evidence of the refined but rich emotion Michelangeli brought to his art watch the VAI DVD of him performing Beethoven's Sonata Op. 2, No. 3. Returning, however, to Chopin: I suspect that the balance of elegance and deceptive strength we hear in Michelangeli is much closer to Chopin's own playing than that of the romantic players who followed in the wake of Liszt, Anton Rubinstein, D'Albert and Cortot. At the heart of Michelangeli is a still, mysterious melancholy. This might not seem appropriate for the more rollicking mazurkas that Ignaz Friedman played inimitably, but then Michelangeli didn't choose to record them all. For somewhat similar magic listen to Pachmann -- also disparaged by many modern critics. And then come back to this recording.
B00007GZQI|2.0|Tedious tale of the world's richest man(Sellers) and his adopted son(Ringo) out to prove that people will do anything for money. This results in a series of comic(?) vignettes that are out to prove this point. Many cameos (Raquel Welch, Yul Brynner) that prove to be a waste of our and their time. One of the few times I laughed was during a cameo by John Cleese as an auctioneer. &quot;Come and Get It&quot; by Badfinger is played at the beginning and that's pretty catchy. Otherwise, it's a waste of time for both Sellers and Beatles fans.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|After reading the other reviews on this sight I decided to toss my 2 cents into the well: This 2003 expanded remaster is the best stereo version of SP to be issued on cd. It is far more natural than the previous RCA/BMG editions, notably the rather murky-sounding 1995 gold-disc, and the nearly indistinguishable version released a few years later, both of which contained the reverb-heavy stereo mix followed by the much different mono mix. As listener who wants the closest thing to the original master-tape possible, this beats the stereo/mono set hands down. There is, of course, perceptable hiss on the original master, and to remove it would be to remove subtle musical information as well.(This is why I preferred the DCC version of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds to Capitol's sterile revision.) The chief drawback for those of us who already own the JA catalog on CD, is that for this new edition of SP Sundazed svengali Bob Irwin (who did a beautiful job remasterinng and each title and researching available extra goodies)has chosen to include for thie compact disc only the stereo mix (1997's blah transfer offered both, quite different stereo and mono masters), instear adding several bonus cuts from the same late 1966-early 1967 period, some of which were originally issued on the JA's farewell album, \\"Early Flight\\" (1974), a superb rareties set itself reissued in 1997, but now out of print. I would have preferred an upgrade on that title to having its tracks dispersed amongst the new reissues; those tracks are indeed excellent - hear the six-and-a-half minute blues 'In The Morning' by Jorma, featuring blues piano from Goldy McJohn, who soon hit big with Steppenwolf. Jerry Garcia's presence and influence is also quite unmistakable. And with the \\"Early Fligt\\" tracks (restored to their original mixes) oiut of the way we get a a few previously unissued delights (tho not as many as are included on \\"Takes Off\\" or later catalog titles). And mono single versions of \\"Pillow's\\" two top10 hits, 'Somebody To Love' and 'White Rabbit'.    Repeating the formula of including both mono and stereo albums, exlcuding the excellent bonus material, was one option, but Irwin's re-do of the reverb-drenched mono mix can be easily found on his own Sundazed label, on a beautiful (and inexpensive)180-gram vinyl reissue, which is exceptional (as are their Otis, MG's, and Love vinyl reissues, to name a few), and both the mono master and all original LP cover art have been meticulously reproduced (it is in print and available directly from the Sundazed label's label's website, under 'Sundazed Store').    So, for my money, the new SP cd upgrade is as close to the original stereo first pressing (good luck tracking that down for under three figures, let alone in mint condition) as we're likely to get unless a SACD is made.   To re-mix a classic like this, as Franl Zappa and Elvis Costello attempted a decade ago with their own catalogs, would be ill advised, and eventually date the sound (hey, early 90's drums!)- and it rewrites aural history. Careful, very occasionally deployed eq to eliminate specific tape flaws are all I want done to a seminal album. And neeedless to say, though the band would \\"sound\\" better on subsequent recordings (\\"Crown Of Creation,\\" for example) the music on \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" is classic!
B00004Z4WR|2.0|This is just one of those predictable dumbed down action movies that leaves you wondering why you just spent 2 hours watching it. The only good thing about this movie is Angelina Jolie is in it. If you are a big Angelina fan you may as well buy it if you see if for real cheap (like 5.99) because there are a healthy amount of extras including interviews with Angelina. <br />But this is just a seen 1 seen em all type movie. I find Nicolas Cage REALLY annoying in this movie although I am a fan of his but I prefer him in dramas and not cheesey action flicks like this. <br />The plot is ok on paper but the dialogue/script is really poor and you just know exactly how this movie will pan out and how it will end....so predictable. The cops were really annoying, especially the young detective...he tried ever so hard to be the cocky/funny type cop that can sometimes be interesting but like everything else in this movie it just fell flat. <br />Vinnie Jones' character was the only mildly interesting character in this film and he doesn't even speak!!! He used to be a soccer player here in England, he was a really dirty, aggressive player so its no wonder he plays a lot of bad guys in his movies.      <br />If you like cheesey, flat, predictable action flicks then this is right up your street, some of the car chases are pretty cool but its not quite as thrilling watching these in your bedroom as a pose to a cinema is it? I recommend saving your money & buying Leon instead now there is a great movie.

B000294SFW|5.0|I normally don't write reviews, but I feel compelled to by this release. Loud, fast and uncompromising , &quot; Inferno &quot; is one hell of a listen. Where else can you hear the lines &quot; Came out of exile for a handful of dust &quot; & &quot;..pity you still think like a monkey &quot; ? I truly respect the fact that regardless of trends, Motorhead continues to produce their music on their own terms. A brilliant, powerful album that will be almost impossible to top, &quot; Inferno &quot; is some of Motorhead's heaviest stuff. &quot; In The Name Of Tragedy &quot; is one of their greatest. The appearence of Steve Vai on 2 tracks doesn't hurt either.  <br /> Inspired, Brutal and Honest - But what else would you expect from Motorhead ?

In fact it probably made it even better. The music was phenomenal as were the special effects, the storyline, and the cast. And this CD has all the great songs and i loved it even before i saw the show. I really reccomend it! WICKEDLY ENTERTAINING!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is the best that she has ever made. I would love to see her top this. This CD is full of inspirational songs. Her vocal cords are so powerful and amazing, my family and friends didnt even know who was singing for some songs cause she sounds so amazing. This shouldnt even be called a pop album. Honestly, whenever I'm feeling down I just blast this CD, and just like a previous writer wrote, I feel sooo much better. Due to the CD's title many people may shy away from owning it, but truthfully, this CD is basically her letting go off all her fears and acknowledging situations in life in a more positive way. There are many songs on this CD that you can relate to no matter who you are. Even if one song doesnt apply to you today, the next day in its own way, it just may and will lift you up.
6305169187|1.0|If you like Michael Bay's movies (Bad Boys, Pearl Harbor) then you'll love this one. Don't bother reading further, it won't change your mind and you'll just ignore my advice anyway. <br /> <br />I actually can give this movie one star, not just rate it at one and lament that I can't give it zero stars. I give it that one star for belonging to that wonderful category \\"So Awful It's Fun To Watch.\\"  <br /> <br />With a less talented cast, this movie would simply be so torturous as to violate the Geneva Conventions. But in the hands of Billy Bob Thornton and Bruce Willis and Liv Tyler, the DOA screenplay actually comes off comically, almost as if the actors know just how bad the dialogue and story is, and they are playing parodies of their own characters.  <br /> <br />Every character is a caricature, a stereotype of some sort, from Bruce and Billy in the major roles, to Ben and Liv as teens in forbidden love, right down to the scientists who appear on screen just long enough to deliver a howler and make the entire scientific/engineering community look like the textbook definition of \\"geekboys\\", as well as a pair of Korean tourists who can't be bothered with meteors destroying New York and insist on going shopping in the midst of the chaos. <br /> <br />Every scene is a classic B-movie scene, from the cliche \\"war room\\" scenes of the president and his men trying to understand the imminent disaster, down to the \\"which wire do I cut?!\\" scene, and the final \\"daddy I love you\\" from Liv Tyler. You have seen all of these scenes before in other movies - Bay simply does his job in stringing them together into something resembling a plot. <br /> <br />And every other line of script is a howler. I have read many reviews of other disaster films in which critics lambaste films for packing X number of cliches in two hours, but this movie sets the standard.  <br /> <br />And yet, it's still dumb fun, if that's what you're looking for. Don't expect to be swept up in the story or to bedazzled by the sci-fi effects. Don't expect to care about the characters or what happens to them. But do expect to laugh, and laugh hard, at this anemic attempt at cinema.
B0002DB52M|5.0|i first saw this film long after it's release. a bit wary as I am not a devoted fan of von trier but i much admire a lot of his work and appreicate his efforts. i have to say, i really don't get the anti american stand. he may be pointing to hypocrisies in american culture: social and political at the end with the montage but i really saw the montage as a portrait of humanity in all its forms and did not, despite the Bowie song, limit the faces to America. What exactly does it mean to be human? What are our responsibilites to ourselves and to others? I think Dogville was about each of us, about humanity at various moments along the way. And, as Kidman says in the end, they did the best they could under very difficult circumstances. Just like we all do, even though our best may not be &quot;good&quot; enough and we have in fact behaved badly, very badly sometimes. The film is rich with so many disturbing and beautiful and frightening and sad and complicated facets of humanity, of myself, I was suspended and made breathless and trembling by the end. Once in a blue moon are you touched so completely by a film. Dogville touched me, shoved me and kicked me. Brilliant.
0671775308|4.0|This is not a how-to book, nor does it claim to be.      What it does is examine the habits, attitudes, and demographics of &quot;prodigious accumulators of wealth&quot; (i.e. The Millionaires Next Door), compared to those that consume and consume, living from paycheck to paycheck. It dispels some myths about millionaires, showing that just because you flaunt it, doesn't mean you have it.       For example, the authors explain that most consumers of luxury goods are living dangerously. People who live in homes that are too expensive (i.e. with a mortgage more than twice that of their yearly taxable income) are living dangerously. Their lives are precariously balanced between earn and spend, and any number of major life events could leave them in serious trouble.      The book doesn't tell you how to live, but it does explain the common-sense principles required to accumulate wealth. It's not perfect, and reads too much like a spreadsheet at times. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book for two main reasons.      1) Common sense is uncommon. Sure, it sounds easy. Make wise choices in life, and you will live securely. But how many of us do it? The book explains why being a millionaire doesn't take being well-bred or brilliant, using illustrative stories of real people, and how they earn and spend. Admittedly, one person's &quot;frugal&quot; is another person's &quot;tightwad&quot;. We wouldn't always want to be these people, but they do have good ideas.      2) Life expectancies are on the rise. You may argue that you work hard for your money, so why not just spend it now? Thanks to modern medicine, there is a significant likelihood that you will live (in reasonable health) to age 80. Will you be able to work until you're 80? What will you do when you retire at 65 or even 70, with nothing left in your bank account to last you the next 10 to 15 years? Wait for handouts from your children and grandchildren, or the government? The millionaires next door can afford toretire earlier, and maintain their standard of living.      In short, being a millionaire isn't about hoarding money or living extravagantly. It's about common-sense security and independence.
B000268QB2|5.0|I absolutely love Keane. Their songs are poetic and it makes you feel great. I recommend this album to anyone.
B000068OSK|5.0|Can't Stop Listening to that SWEET ROCK! I think this White Stripes Album is as sweet as Candy, as Sweet as the Peppermint Candy the band named themselves after. <br /> <br />I just absolutley love the sound, the beats, the melody, rythem, all of it. The sound rocks the wax from my ears. Not because of the words, but the mix between thumping drums, Jacks guitar and his voice just coming through creating a synergetic wonder! Favourite tunes include Big three, Cannon, Astro, Suzy Lee, St James...I'm not a music person, but when i hear what I like, i know what I like, and this is just ... ohmygod! <br /> <br />Wasting My Time is a pretty good one too. Full stars...it deserves.
6301661737|5.0|Like several others who have reviewed this movie for Amazon, I too prefer Kagemusha to Ran.  The story is more intriguing and unusual, and the movie asks several of the \\"big questions\\" of life:  What does it mean to be a leader?  Can anyone truly KNOW another person, even if you are very close to them?  Does personality or individuality matter, or is form what matters? Is there any value in war when everything is laid to waste in the end?  This is one of my favorite films of all time, it is somewhat long by American standards, but it is very absorbing and beautiful.  I consider it a much greater and more subtle achievement than Ran.
0553573403|5.0|George R.R. Martin picks up the ball right where Robert Jordan dropped it. Creating a fantasy epic that has as much to do with political intrigue as fighting, magic and all the other usual stuff that makes up fantasy novels. If everything in Wheel of Time from Crown of Swords on were done right it would probably end up something like this series. Where Jordan fails in the past few WoT novels, Martin succeeds. Characters who are supposed to be clever actually do clever things, plot twists are unpredictable, and the political intrigue is actually intriguing. The book centers around the Stark family a powerful house in the cold north. Eddard Stark is good friends with the King who comes to ask him to be the hand of the king (a sort of overseer) when their father figure, the previous hand, Jon Arryn dies. Eddard goes with 2 of his daughters to the capital way down south. All isn't as it seems though since Eddard suspects the Queen had Jon Arryn killed and goes more to investigate that more than out of loyalty to his friend. Alot more happens in subplots involving the rest of the family but that's the primary thing the story revolves around. I recommend this to anyone into fantasy with a more realistic edge to it. There is no magic in this book and really only a couple that set it apart from our world. An interesting approach that I'm not sure if I like better or not. If your one of those people who gets attached to the characters in books I wouldn't read this. None of them are ever safe from dying. I'll stop right there since I wouldn't wan't to spoil anything. New fantasy epic that will end all others? Probably not, I've heard that many times over the past few years and it never turns out to be true. Definitly worth picking up and hopefully the series won't start getting boring for a long time.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Truly amazing epic feature. Russel Crowe is brilliant and the CG is unbelievable. A must buy for any war or movie fan.
B000002H70|5.0|Kyle of South Park called Disintegration &quot;the best album ever.&quot; Well, it is definitely the best Cure album anyway. It is one of those rare CDs one can play with the &quot;Repeat All&quot; button on. There is not one weak track on the album. Each is a brilliant work of art. It makes for excellent background music as many of the songs clock in at over 6 minutes with long instrumental pieces before the vocals kick in (the opening track, for example, is that type of song with the powerful instrumental beginning that sets the tone for the rest of the album). There are also plenty of catchy individual tracks like &quot;Lovesong&quot; and &quot;Pictures of You.&quot; Favorite tracks of mine are &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot; and the 12th track (not listed above) &quot;Untitled&quot; which is very pleasant. I recommend this album to anyone who likes rich synthesizers, heavy bass, and dark (but catchy) mood music.
6305268843|5.0|What a gorgeous and moving film! The acting was superb. Sophie Marceau was riveting. I personally think Stephen Dillane is one very sexy man. The cinematography was wonderful and scenes were beautifully shot. Such passion and feeling projected off the screen. And I loved the little house on the lake. I want one like it. I rented this a few years back with my mom and we loved it! Too bad it's not on DVD in the US. I ordered mine from asia. But everyone must see this film! I think I'm obsessed.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|i like this crew but the disc is lacking.peep afroman and rap with a live funk band.  reppin the streetteam
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This collection of all four of the Alien movie series really does an excellent job of really compiling a very uneven movie franchise and packing it up onto one amazing, if imperfect, set with each of the individual movies having their original versions as well as ?Special Editions? of each one, with a ninth disc, and the result is a downright awesome DVD set.<br /><br />ALIEN (1979): This Ridley Scott directed classic broke so much new ground when it was released. A team of deep space pioneers are returning home from earth when a mysterious signal on a desolate planet is received by the crew aboard the ship Nostromos. When they are sent in to investigate where this mysterious signal came from, they have no idea of the horrors that they will find themselves up against. This one is incredibly groundbreaking and is very suspenseful. The special effects are extremely dated though but this is still a powerful sci-fi classic.<br /><br />ALIENS (1986): This one is easily the best one in my catalog. I can easily remember how much this movie scared me to death when it was released when I was only a toddler. In this one, Ripley is in cryogenic suspension for over 57 years and when she is awaked after all of that time, she is told that the planet that she escaped from after killing the alien there has been colonized. However, as the colony began to flourish, contact is suddenly lost?.completely?..and now a team of Space Marines is sent in with Ripley being the ?advisor? to the team and to rescue any possible survivors, but then realize that Ripley?s main enemy species has made it?s nest there and now they must destroy the nest and the aliens there and escape?if they can. This is easily my favorite of the bunch because of so many things. The acting is almost perfect by everyone. James Cameron?s directing is his best he?s ever done and the special effects even by 1980s standards are absolutely amazing and hardly even show their age.<br /><br />ALIEN 3 (1992): This one to me is one of the most unfairly criticized and underrated classics of all time. At the same time though, I sometimes felt troubled at some of the things that happened in this film in the beginning. Ripley finds herself on a planet after an alien in fact laid an egg onboard the spachship that she, Hicks and Newt were on and where the Queen Alien was defeated. An acid spill causes an electrical fire which causes the escape pod to detach and Ripley is the only survivor once again after the pod crashes into the ocean of a desolate planet where dangerous prisoners are held in a high-security facility called Fury 161. The prisoners however along with Ripley are being hunted by a much deadlier breed Alien like no other and they have No weapons to fight the creature. Ripley herself finds out that her biggest nightmare has come true and that the alien isn?t her only enemy anymore. I?ve always had mixed feelings towards this movie. The most troubling were that two of my favorite characters from the previous one are killed off and it was really depressing. The biggest problem I had with this was that it used the F-Bomb too much. A few such bombs are fine from time to time but sheesh, cut down on them please! Otherwise, this movie is nonetheless a strong entry. The extended cut of this is light years better and replaces some footage from the original version and replaces it while adding previously unreleased footage and extending the movie by over 30 minutes. The result is a much improved version that while deeply flawed no matter what, makes it a lot better than before.<br /><br />ALIEN RESURRECTION (1997): Easily my least favorite of the bunch, I nonetheless find it enjoyable to some extent due to it?s awesome special effects and action sequences. 200 years after Ripley?s passing, scientists from the company that wanted to quarantine the creature have managed to acquire both it and Ripley?s DNA and cloned both of them. The Alien species that her ?ancestor? had fought hard to destroyforever is now heading towards humanity?s home planet Earth and if the Alien makes it there, it could spell catastrophe for humanity. I?ve always had mixed opinions about this movie back when it was released and still do to this day. I?ve always felt that this was more like some kind of spinoff of some sort rather than the continuation of the Alien Saga but it interesting to take into account cloning her even if the samples have survived for over 200 years exposed to the elements. The acting except by Weaver herself of course was hammy and really dogged this movie. Easily the weakest but nonetheless enjoyable but only for Alien die-hards. For everyone else, the first three are more than satisfactoryto destroy forever is now heading towards humanity?s home planet Earth and if the Alien makes it there, it could spell catastrophe for humanity.

B00015TOCY|5.0|i have all four of the eno album that where reissued this past year [04] and i just fell in love with this one the most it just reminds me of a movie with messed up scenes. it moves beautifully across the room.i can't stop playing the album. it just grabbed on to me from the first song to the last.i'm a big fan of roxy music, which eno was part of for two albums, but this is just so different and u kinda know why he left other than the fact that him an bryan didn't like each other much. this is an album to get if not all.
630575067X|1.0|I tried to like it, I really did.  It's Star Wars for Cripes sake!  At first I was stunned, then sad, then just angry!  In defense of Lucas, I think he had a stroke or something and now he's retarded.  There really isn't any other explaination.  It was like a porn film, only without the sex, script or acting!  I felt dumber for watching it and it pisses me off that I'll never get those 2 hours of my life back.   <br /> <br />I thought it was a fluke so when the Attack of the Clones came out, I, like a complete dumbass, went to see it.  Needless to say, now there are 4 hours of my life gone with nothing to show for it.  I could have spent that time slamming my testicals in a door jam or trying to score at the nursing home.   <br /> <br />Should I even bother seeing the Revenge of the Sith?  I think I'll wait till it comes to TV, not cable, UPN or the WB!  Why should I fork out 10 bucks for that crap, when I could spend that money on some crack.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Just like he's done on VHS, he'll keep re-releasing different versions, trying to suck out as much $ as he can. I bought the original movies on VHS. Then, I bought the widescreen versions when they were available. Then, I bought the new edition's in widescreen (not sure why I felt compelled other than the influence the originals had on my childhood). <br /> <br />Well, I won't play any more. I'm not even going fork over cash to see the finale of the pot-boiler prequels. I'll buy when the original versions come out on DVD (in widescreen), but not 'till then. Hear that George? <br /> <br />-- a disillusioned fan
B0000C3I6U|5.0|The movie is fantastic. Whenever I lack inspiration to get myself in the gym, this baby is out of its covers and into the dvd player. 10 minutes later I am amped and yearning for iron! <br /> <br />The extra features make this dvd a must have. It was awesome seeing all the original big guys getting together and talking about what pumping iron meant to them.  <br /> <br />Probably the coolest part of the extra features is the interview with arnold where he dispells many of the myths surrounding this show (the stolen t-shirt, smoking the joint, arnold's cold presence in the movie, steroids (!), lou's dad etcetera). <br />
B00006CXXU|4.0|Who knew that a pop star who used to sing A&R garbage could come up with a song like \\"Beautiful?\\" I consider this the FIRST real Christina album. Her career begins from this point.
B000002KET|5.0|First of all I know many of you will throttle me for saying this, but here goes...I would assume that most Black Sabbath fans would list earlier works such as \\"Paranoid\\" as the best works of the \\"Ozzy Era\\"...however to me \\"Sabbath Bloddy Sabbath\\" grabbed me and stuck with me more than any other Sabbath recording.  Perhaps this may be because I was at the impressionable age of 14 when the original LP was released but I think it is also because this damned thing just souds so good.  The band is tight, there's great vocal harmonies, the cover art is the coolest.  So I grabbed the CD reissue adn wow, nothing has changed.  The sucker sounds as good or as better.  I reccommend if you are a metal fan and you don't have \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\"  you buy this thing and enjoy.
B000099T2L|1.0|This disk is nothing but an ego fest. Destiny's Child was one of the few solid groups out there before Beyonce \\"Diana Rossed\\" out with this boring CD. Listen to \\"The Writing's on the Wall\\" and then listen to this CD. Can you notice the difference? Beyonce's a mediocre singer who needs dance tracks to support her vocals. Destiny's child really helped her in ways that become apparent now that she's solo. The bottom line is: she just isn't that damn charismatic. Yeah she's pretty but if she never took all her clothes off she wouldn't be as interesting to the public, now would she? I have no doubt in my mind that she'll be playing German discos ten years from now just like her idol Ms. Ross.
