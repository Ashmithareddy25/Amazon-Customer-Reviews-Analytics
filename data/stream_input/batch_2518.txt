B00BHMF578|5.0|a lot of passion mistory and good end - like american movie - i saw it with my wife and we both had a great time
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I have already recommended this book to a variety of friends. I absolutely loved it. What a really good read
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|we saw it all the family together - the kids didn't like so do we - it is a simple story and nothing else
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Love The Good Wife!  However, I have been disappointed with Amazon's instant video streaming.  Netflix is far superior both in quality and functionality, but Netflix doesn't have TGW on instant stream...
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|If you enjoyed the original Cut the Rope game, you will really enjoy the new Time Travel version.  It includes new challenges, such as having an additional om nom to feed.  It also includes new ways to feed your om nom, like chainsaws (how else can you cut the new chain ropes) and telekinesis (!).  It's fun and not violent, a great game for children and adults alike.
B007T99ENE|5.0|Entertaining and clever, I couldn't put the book down. What Escher does in his art, McEwan accomplishes in this novel. I was surprised and spun round until the end and loved the experience.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This app was ok, but it could have some tweeks in it. Like, how it taught you songs and let you save your own songs, i like that feature. But, i didnt like how it had some free songs and some payed songs, just like smule magic piano. It had some problems, but $till enjoyable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. I love minecraft, but there's something I want to be added. In the next update I heard there will be servers. I also heard that the next update was suppose to come out may 16th or the 17th. But it never did. So I'm upset and I feel like Mojang has lied to me I want that update so I can play with my friends with out having to have them over. Please Mojang, if you're reading this get the update out before June 7th 2013.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book, I couldn't put it down. In fact, the whole series was captivating. I would recommend this book to all my friends.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|The plot was lame.  The audio/video and picture quality was excellent, i just didn't enjoy the plot (was there even a plot??).  It could have been appropriate for children, but the cussing/bad language was TOO FREQUENT, I would never allow my child to see it.  The movie was very unbelievable and I wasted my money renting.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is an essential app for the Kindle Fire hd. It has excellent graphics. I especially like how it details how much time you have remaining of each activity (i.e. reading, surfing the web, watching video). Well worth the money.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|love watching this show.  nice to have it on amazon makes it so much easier for those who don't have time to follow the date and times on the regular networks.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|extraneous pad made reading tedious...like child had to submit x words and was reaching!  plotline contrived for film and thus a big stretch
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|So glad that I was able to download this season and finally catch up. Way cheaper and more convenient than buying dvds.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I have the CD's of Wings Over America that were released in the 80's they were simply horrible.  I also have the 3 mini disc Japanese version that was FAR superior to the original CD's.  This remaster is simply fantastic!  It should have NOT taken so long to release this fantastic remastered album.  I was at the Seattle show in 1976 where Rock Show was recorded, so this album is very special to me.  I've also ordered Rock Show on Blu-Ray and I just hope that it is this great.  Thank you Paul!
B00821OX98|4.0|I like the overall idea of the series.  Streaming on Prime I found myself watching two episodes at a time when I only planned on watching one.  One thing the series is missing is subtle character development.  Motivations are broad and the audience is constantly reminded by Tom how important his boys are.  Also the pacing at times gets too frantic as the 2nd Mass moves from one crisis to the next.  I get the need to keep things moving, but at times it feels rushed.  But compared to alien invasion movies and series from TV's past, this is pretty good.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I could not get this app to work on my kindle fire.  I've tried everything. Good thing was nothing lost as this app is free.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is my most used app. It wakes me up in the morning, plays music for transitions in my school day (I am the teacher), and has a super timer, for math and reading timings. You can use apps, music, and or ringtones for any alarm, and all the alarms are easily manipulated. I first got the free app, but used it and loved it so much I bought the app. Great at home, for an alarm clock or kitchen timer too!! Plus you can bring it with you while cooking. It works wonderfully on my tablet and phone. I highly reccomend this app
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Each season and each episode keep getting better and better!  Sadly this is the last season for the Tenth Doctor.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a young woman just entering the career world, I found this book to be extremely helpful for women like me. I also recommend this book to men as well as women because I believe that anyone can profit from what Sheryl Sandberg has to say about making work and home more equal environments for both genders.
B00CFQN12Q|1.0|I am a long time fan of the Die Hard series. In fact, I have really enjoyed All of the Die hard movies until I saw &#34;A good day to Die Hard&#34;. It was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I can't even quite explain it but many aspects of a normal Die Hard movie were all missing. I think the terrible writing and story played a major role into ruining this movie sadly :(<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie and I didn't believe all the other bad reviews since I had loved all the other Die Hard movies but don't even waste your time with this one. It is nothing like the other Die Hard movies!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I hate writing reviews and sometimes even reading them. I just want an honest opinion if the book is good or bad and that's it. Mine definitively goes beyond good, AWESOME is more like it. After reading the first page I was hooked. Yeah, that good.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This was by far  the best book I have ever read!  (Besides The Hunger Games trilogy and the Harry Potter series of course.) Absolutely engaging, and thrilling. A real cliffhanger. Coudn't put it dosn.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good and addictive game can't keep my eyes of it always die tho but yh it's a really amazing game
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book! A super hot love story that will leave you wanting more. Sylvia Day is amaxing!  A definite must read!
0307292096|5.0|Overall, just a really nice book and package.  It adds a nice looker to my bookshelf and I am a huge fan of the series.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|I love this movie.  It depicts Jiro’ s humble dedication to his craft and his role as a patriarch.  One of my favorites of all time; the underlying spiritual quality is what really got me, and the sushi is flat-out gorgeous!<br />For those who criticize Jiro as a Dad, please remember that the culture is not western, he had no strong role models at home as a child, and that none of us are perfect.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|This movie is not much of a fairy tale but it's so romantic. It shows how love can be in the real world. I love it!
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|Downloaded Ps and found it had most of the features as the full software installed on my PC that I use to edit my photos as photography as a avocation.
B000HF0J36|4.0|Fact is like all shark movies they all look fake. I remember convincing my mother to let me see this film in theaters when I was 8 back in 1999. I've never seen a tiger shark that was greenish/brown and had a pointed nose. I also think  killing samuel L Jackson's character in fact I think both the black guys should of survived in this movie. I think if safforn burrows character really didnt want to get electicuted she would of taken all of her clothes off. but all in all it was a good movie.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Don't listen to the propaganda, this is not a book about bdsm.  It is fundamentally a love story with a kinky sexy life.  I enjoyed it and have read the whole trilogy a few times now.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|If I could play the 'bejeweled' portion of the game and get rid of the story line, I'd be happy. I'd be happier yet if I had the option to skip the timed version.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is one the best examples of a band full of master musicians showing thier abilities and loving every minute of it. Watching David Gilmour reproduce the guitar parts so vividly is what I love the best. No other band puts on a show equivelent to Floyd!  Well worth seeing, several times!
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|He is six, when I asked him how he would rate this movie, he said &#34;really, really, really, good!&#34; He watched it twice.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|Can play this cd for hours.  The song '1960 What' is the Bomb!  The other grooves are as smooth as butter.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Interesting subject matter and depiction of life's rough spots and how they can interfere with one's success. Well worth watching.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Series is getting better, so I will continue reading.  One of life's simple pleasures.  Entertaining, did not want to put it down.
B008RJFRTK|4.0|Very useful when no connection to the internet is available. Nice too, that you clutter your mobile with only the maps you need.
B00992CF6W|5.0|get this app also get launcher pro to change your character into example:sky does minecraft get them on [...] download go to options change skin go to file download press on it and you have your skin.THIS GAME IS AAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOMMMMMMEEEEEE.also subscribe to Tobuscus Pewdipie Skydoesminecraft and the best NIGAHIGA
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|Excellent portrayal of life's lessons vis-a-vis poking fun at others and their perceived weaknesses only to find out that through teamwork and camaraderie these &#34;weaknesses&#34; can be overcome. Good wholesome story for youngsters and &#34;oldsters&#34; alike.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|All in all, a good job of getting the essence of Lee Child's lead character on film and Tom Cruise does his usual great job playing a role.  But - he is so far off the physical description of Jack Reacher as imagined by Lee Child that they may as well have cast the late Michael Jackson for the part!  Still, the movie was very entertaining overall.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This novel was not as gripping as Brown's previous titles, but it was entertaining all the same.  I certainly feel more educated after reading this than any of his other works.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Tells a bit of his story but I wish it had been a bit more detailed.  Still it was a good read overall and enjoyable.
B003XU02QG|4.0|I recommend this film. There is something very likeable about this straight-forward, entertaining story. The film is also free from any of the unrealistic and contrived plot points that characterize so many Hollywood films these days. Michael Fassbender and Axelle Carolyn's characters are very believable and likeable. There is an unpretentious simplicity about the storyline and the main characters that make this film very appealing in its own way. By the end of the film I found myself liking the characters of Quintus Dias, Aeron, and the two remaining Roman soldiers who face off against the Picts, along with Quintus, in the abandoned Roman fort. The story-book ending between Quintus and Aeron was a very nice touch. Overall, it is the genuine, likeable, human quality of the main characters that make this film very entertaining in a rare and special way.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|My finance and I watched this movie thinking it might just be alright.  We were pleasantly surprised to find it quite enjoyable.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Beautiful Darkness was an excellent book. It isn't a love story, it is an adventure. A tale wrought with danger, twists and turns, love, and good versus evil. I definitely recommend it, especially if the first book, Beautiful Creatures, left you with an \\"I could have done without that book\\" kind of feeling.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Just reading the book now and revisited this classic movie. I love the story, but I recommend the book too!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game but the menus are not as intuitive as they could be, but the<br />instructor is there to help figure out what to do.<br />I like this game as does my 5 year old.<br /><br />The downside to this game is after you get to levels 5 or 6, there are tons of popup ads and some are not clear where to decline the ad if the child sees the ad or someone that cannot read.<br /><br />This game is easier for a nonreader if someone reads the activities to them.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|This is a cute app, but doesn't keep the granddaughter too preoccupied as some of the places where she touches want you to buy additional enhancements.  Had to block it from her, because she was continually being asked to buy more.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Just an all-around fun game, and VERY well done. If you like classic arcade games (Galaga, Defender, and the like) then just get this game and enjoy it!
B005HEWLQA|1.0|major selling point for instant video is mobility. flash is not mobile anymore! no android or iOS support.<br /><br />change to HTML 5!!!!!
B0094M2S5A|5.0|I just love this movie, I love the music and everything about it.  Has great actors and a good story line.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|All I need is 3 words to describe this. Great Fantastic Action. This book was a great read. Buy it
B005L38QHA|2.0|I purchased this mouse about two months ago.  I enjoyed the feel and ease of use of it (I'm female so the size was perfect); however, just after two months, the cord has started to malfunction right where it feeds into the mouse so that, as I move the mouse, it loses and gains connection.  Ultimately, it is a very cheaply made mouse that is overpriced because it has World of Warcraft on it and it changes pretty colors.  If you're looking for a serious gaming mouse, this isn't it.
B005UG542S|4.0|just watched it to see how the series ended, it wasn't as dull as part 1. might watch it again if the price is right
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|I watched this originally because of David Tennant and his character was by far my favorite, but the whole movie ended up being really good.  There was just the right balance of scary and funny.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was fantastic and perfect for small kids. I have 3 children and they watched the entire movie without even getting up for toys or a drink. They were hooked.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!! There was nothing I disliked about it. I can't wait to read the other 2!
0345803485|1.0|I will say the first book was 'meh.. Okay' the last two were pathetic. How did this book become a best seller?? Ana is unlikeable, annoying, and just plain stupid. I mean, the whole not eating thing or forgetting to eat... Gimme a break! I found it difficult to relate and I think EL James had a tough time deciding how she wanted Ana to be portrayed. One moment she was some young/dumb/nymphomaniac (hey that's a song!) then she was assertive, direct, and wasn't afraid to stand up to other women (or Grey). I found it laughable that Greys \\"doctor/shrink\\" also had no problem divulging his patients private matters with some girlfriend! To top it off he bought the company she was interning at, and made his girlfriend the CEO are you kidding me!??<br />I can't imagine any reputable actors signing on to this movie script.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|I got this through a review of The Name of the Wind and although it was definitely no NotW it was good in its own way. The use of magic as a hidden character and the dark aspects of the story were very compelling. The one thing that I feel pulls it away from a 5 star rating is a the lack of a completely original feel to the story. Granted, no story is completely &#34;original&#34;, all stories have interconnecting elements but I felt that this one had a few too many similarities to other stories I had read. Overall, an enjoyable read, I would suggest it to others and I really hope the sequel brings about even more character development. So really... 4.5 stars.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, especially with a couple of other people. It's a good conversation piece, that allows for group participation or just putting components together on your own.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|No words can tell you, you need to try this game. This game brings puzzles games to a whole new level.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This book was brilliant, little bit slow to start with and then it just got better and better.I was totally blown away as to how  a person can write a story that shows how both men and women can be manipulated  in a relationship by first love and then fear.<br />Reminded me of a Susan Sloan book i read years ago called An Isolated Incident.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Does what it is supposed to do.  A good solitaire game.  I recommend it.  Great application for a free ap.
B009PXNFQE|5.0|I already had the standard edition of the album, but when I found out I could get 7 new songs, I had to get this. SO worth it. The extra songs are some of my favorites, and I loved the album already!
B0063GORYU|3.0|This works fine.  I have one on my pc that lets me undo.  You really need that if you play with four suites.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I liked it but it got stuck after level 7!!! I had to buy it 2 times! Otherwise good game.
B0081336FO|4.0|A great show with some great cinematic bits.  I love the way it's filmed and the plots this season were a lot of fun!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I loved this item because it had all three DVDs in perfect condition and it is one one of my favorite movies. The action in these movies is just so gripping and exciting, it makes you want to watch them all over again.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I really love playing this game! I DEFINITELY recommend!<br />AWESOME! Once you play, you'll understand!  I hope to see more games like this in the not so distant future!
B002GNDXY4|2.0|We were looking for something the whole family could watch.  The first episode telegraphed that the series was going to be a bit odd.  Then the 2nd episode with the bug guy was just way creepy.  Seems like maybe the director is a horror director or something. This show leans toward a dark, edgy creepy side and we just didn't enjoy it. The acting is good and the writing seemed decent, but it just wasn't our thing.  Basically it's about the way you feel when the episode is over and mostly it's like, &#34;why did I watch that?&#34; Too bad because it could've been a fun series.
B00AJLHU3K|3.0|It was just not what I expected but I bought it on the basis of hearing one song.  It's great in the car and relaxing though!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|My review is not for your new cord. This review is of the defect that is obvious in the kindle fire charge port. One month before the warrenty expired the kindle charge port stopped working. You would have to find its perfect point or it would not charge.I tried every cord possible to have the kindle fire charge. It did not work, we kind of moved it to the side and kept moving through the holidays. Sometime in January when Amazon wanted to renew the prime account we realized that our kindle fire was not charging at all. So we renewed with amazon and tried again to find a cord that would work. At this piont several of my sons classmates noticed the same thing going on with the kindle fires that they had recieved a year ago for Christmas too. I called the kindle fire hotline and recieved the new cord,( which was obviously made because there was a problem with the kindle fire charging port cord not fitting right ) It charged the kindle one time at my persistence of an hour to find that right place that would except a charge. It never worked again. Now I have a kindle fire paper wieght......I am very bummed out. I called the hotline again and was told I could buy a new one for a little off. That does not sit well with me. This problem started before the warrenty went out. I really cant afford a new kindle fire. Or even a used one. I am bummed that this unit will be just thrown away into the trash.......what a waste. How about a trade Ill send you mine and you send me a new one. Thanks for listening.....I miss my kindle fire
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great Show, alway interestin, love the chemstry between the characters, I've been watching this show for years and am I always exicted to see the next episode.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha's voice is still as beautiful as it was in the Abba days almost 40 years ago! The songs are beautifully written and deep enough to have substance considering Agnetha's rich character and history yet playful and upbeat enough to maintain keen interest.<br /><br />I love listening to this album when driving long distances as it really is a journey album.<br /><br />5 Stars, Highly recommended!<br /><br />I can't believe the reasonable price they are asking for this album, it's definitely underpriced - I'd rate this as a $30 album not $9.99.<br /><br />Buy it today; you won't be disappointed.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great show...totally addictive. I bought one episode and just kept buying. I devoured the entire season in four nights and can't wait for Season 3 to be available.
B005QBBC2S|4.0|Nicholas Cage really knocks this one out of the park.  Elizabeth Shue as the hooker with a heart of gold offsets his craziness.  Definitely worth your time.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Love MLP even the fact that they remade the ones I grew up with and completely changed the story lines... this game was really fun at first but now it's awful I almost don't wanna play it any more... it is soooo expensive to complete some missions that it takes forever to win gems and bits.. not to mention the game errors constantly after playing the star game trying to load the game itself half the time it freezes my brand-new kindle..it's infuriating.. for a free game it sure costs a lot to complete..and going back to first day bonuses after five days is kinda asinine... the programmers need to rethink the setup and the CEO needs to realize that players would like to progress through the game and finish it without it costing an arm and a leg...ridiculous
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|this film was a slice of life told in a very creative way.  sons and daughters see their parents usually through a very narrow lens until they themselves live enough years to appreciate the weaknesses and strengths of human life.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|This movie is sad. The first 10 minutes of action clip felt like an afterthought, and it does not change the overall pace of the movie, it's slow, boring, and just plain dull. This is another movie you want to walk away after the first 10 minutes, not really a James Bond movie one expects. It's over hyped. By the way, I found most of 5 stars reviews to be less than three lines long. Coincident? Hmmm...
B0026PW67W|5.0|The map is not the same as the map from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (very expensive), but it is a great product for the price. Will be great for decor at any Harry Potter party.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|great game I would recommend it to everyone. keep up the good work. make more. I'll be looking for more of your products.
B0089M0DGM|5.0|take equal parts cab calloway,tito puente and james brown,throw in a little bob marley and youve got the kid creole formula.in other words a non_ stop party.in the u s. almost no one outside of ny city ever heard of them,which is a real shame.in europe they were stars and these two concerts show why.the<br /> show i saw at radio city in nyc ranks as one the best ive ever seen .you owe it to yourself to own this.(but u can skip the conga line sequence at the end)
B00CW665VI|5.0|Emma Chase is my new favorite writter. \\"Tangled\\" was a GREAT read! It had me laughing and sexy at the same time. I started this book mid-day and stayed up until 4am finishing it. Just couldn't put it down! I definite must read!!!
B009LDMJBU|5.0|This album got the essence of Eros and the duets are very nice. Although the previous album is still my favorite this one is very good. It just arrive, maybe I got to listen it a little more and maybe I will change my mind =)
B0016J81B4|4.0|I'm a bartender working 8-9 hour shifts and theses things are awesome..super comfortable, roomy but not too loose, a little hot, but no worse than any other shoes..I did have to build up a bit of a callus above my right ankle from the rivet  of the strap rubbing against my sock..still I'm really happy with these
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Once again, Lady Antebellum does not disappoint....love this CD as I do all of their previous CD's....Hope they continue to do well.  I am a fan!!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I like that I can earn coins and they don't force me to spend my own money to get ahead. It is a fun way way to pass some time.
B009R659L8|5.0|SUSPENSE to the very end. As usual a great book from one of my favorite authors. I can't wait until the next book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great way to teach responsibility without the real thing.  Lesson in real horse care and needs.  Gives the chance. to see how much work it takes.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|This movie has all the elements of a western as well as a history of the pioneers that won the west.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I bought this book at an event with Khaled hosseini. In this event he explained some of the overarching themes of the book and the little connections without spoiling it. had i not have heard these explanations from him, i probably would have been very puzzled by his direction with the book. I really like the book but I didn't love it. His other two previous books are still my favorite. I think one of the reasons why i didn't like it is because every chapter starts talking about a new character, and although the new character is connected to the overall story, i found myself either wanting to know more about their story or not want to know any of it. However, his writing is still beautiful and when I read I can see the images and smell the food and feel the wind. It's almost as if i was there.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a great series. We are truly enjoying the twists & turns within this sci-fi drama. Great acting & story even though it's the<br />second time we've watched it.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|What is a Paper Town? Just read this book and you will find out.  I find John Green's writing style captivating to me.  Paper Towns is another book by John Green that took me on a late adolescent road trip and transported me back to a time of my life that was fun, free and lacking worry.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm  glad  Stephen Chbosky played  such an influential and prominent  role  in the production and making of this book-turned-film. He made  sure the adaptation served the book  justice and carried the feelings it conveyed perfectly. Instant classic.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This is a great beginning to a wonderful adventure into a world of harsh realities. Of discovering love, the agony of love lost, and the self discovery of strengh to persevere. Great storytelling take you through aventures and life altering choices to become the man men want to follow. Every book deepens it's hold on the reader carrying them further into the world beyond \\"The Ring\\".
B0044IABFS|5.0|Loved the other seasons and this one is great too. Lots of twists and turns and constant suspense. Some violence yes but also some goodness and best of all no sex!
B0052AC8C6|1.0|I hate this movie. It's supposed to be a &#34;family friendly&#34; movie but it's dull, has little action, the script is terrible, and none of my children (ages 8, 3, and 2) can get from the beginning of the movie to the end. Horrible, horrible movie and I'm a big Johnny Depp fan.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A highly recommended glimpse into the the bodies, hearts & minds of teenagers with terminal cancer.  I laughed out loud and sobbed shamelessly while remembering how falling into my first love felt and trying to forget the pain of losing someone I  love.  The storyline is clever, the characters are fully available and true, written for both teens and adults. Grateful that I was given an opportunity to meet Hazel and Gus and vicariously  experience meaningful moments through them.<br /><br />Thank you, John Green, for making me feel more alive than I have felt in years.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is the novel that rocked the literary world with its controversial story line. I love it! The characters are well-developed and believable, and the story line makes the reader hypothesize the reality of everything they know about Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and the story of Jesus' adult life. It's fun, and it's creative. The movie only touches on the depth of The Da Vinci Code novel.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is amazing but the vehicle you start out with is ok but is hard to control and other vehicles are pretty expensive. But over all very good.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I love this movie! Such an excellent addition to the Marvel comic book heroes come to life :-) I'd recommend it to anyone who loves the Marvel movies.
B009AMANBA|4.0|This movie was a good one as I saw it in the theaters and had to have a copy once it came out on DVD.<br />We all know the story but the director had a few little twists and turns that were really well placed.<br />Good buy thru Amazon as well
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this as a child and loved it.  I have reread this as an adult and fell in love with the story all over again.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|Purchased this movie and loved it.<br />It had a number of twists and turns and even without Matt Damon as the lead, I like Jeremy Renner and had to see it.<br />Good movie and a good buy as well.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like this app pretty well. It just takes for ever to sync completely. Other than that, it's very useful! I'd even recommend a donation.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Purchased this movie and loved it.<br />It had a number of little twists and turns but had to see it after the nominations it had received.<br />Good movie and a good buy as well.
B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|Love the song \\"Get Lucky\\". Has a amazing, amazing melody. As for the rest-so far not too impressed, but I see what they were going for and that is cool with me. At least it makes for a good sort of retro sounding summer album. If they had only just had some better melodies for the others and had a few more that were a little more upbeat in tempo I would be more intrigued. I think for a lot of people going from the Tron soundtrack to this is such a huge change (even though I respect it and the sound and what they are doing) it can be a bit like...whaaaa? Go to itunes to listen to longer versions of the tracks before committing to buying the entire album here at Amazon. And shame on Amazon for selling singles at the same price as itunes. You could have lowered it by at least a few cents somehow. But I still prefer Amazon to itunes for ease of use and security of songs on their cloud.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Purchased this movie and loved it.<br />It had a number of little twists and turns but had to see it after the nominations it had received.<br />Good movie and a good buy as well.
B00BAWEGPW|4.0|This book is pretty good.It has almost the right combo of the exciting-keep-you-at-the-edge-of-your-seat element and the really-funny element. It's a bit too short,though.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Purchased this movie and loved it.<br />It had a number of little twists and turns but had to see it after the nominations it had received.<br />Good movie and a good buy as well.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|I was one of the lucky people in North America, or anywhere in the world really, to have been at Sound of Contact's very first concert during the Marillion weekend in Montreal in March of this year.  I have been anxiously awaiting this release ever since then!  I am not a great reviewer, but I can tell you that if you are a Genesis, Marillion, Porcupine Tree fan or just like prog rock in general, you will love Dimensionaut!  I know Simon wants to create his own place in the rock world, but it is uncanny how much his voice sounds like his dad (Phil Collins) and if I didn't know differently, I would swear it was Phil playing the drums!! Dave Kerzner rocks the keyboards and Matt Dorsey kills the bass! The great John Wesley of Porcupine Tree plays guitar and toured with SOC in Europe and has been instrumental in their launch, but I get the sense that he will be returning to PT after Steven Wilson completes his Raven tour and PT starts working on some new music.  Ok, so what are you waiting for? download this album right now!!! You won't be sorry!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Pros:<br />This headset has all the features i was looking for, for a decent price.  They are comfortable, noise canceling, very good surround sound.  Even has a built in voice changer with 6 different voices to get some interesting reactions out of your fellow gamers.<br />Cons:<br />I occasionally get what i can best describe as &#34;channel hopping&#34; to get the sound signal back on my headset, this is probably due to my area and all the wireless that i use causing interference but i only notice it while its getting low on battery.  But something people should be aware of.<br /><br />Other than that i am very happy with my headset, i typically game 4-16 hours a day and can wear these for the entire time.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|so the movie was cheesy... so what... the soundtrack is just (if not more) cheesy. still fun to listen to.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Both my boys (ages 8 & 6) really enjoyed the movie.  We actually watched it twice.  Disney always amazes me with their innovation, originality, unique ideas and subtle humor for adults.  They have made yet another wonderful movie.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|the quality of this is awesome. i loved this movie growing up and on blueray it is worth the money. it arrived here earlier than expected too!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I found it bearable but still the PC experience is the best. Need to allow more game play and other capabilities..
B008B1VYP0|3.0|so i bought the whole album thinking &#34;i like some of these songs, i'll just buy the album and maybe like the rest&#34; normally this is true. this time... ehh only ok.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Seeing Katniss in such a vulnerable state was different, I've got to say she definitely overcame, don't like the way the love triangle played out, but it was worth the read!!!
B00149C8BK|4.0|While i get made fun of, i am super glad that i bought this. It's really a lot of fun to listen to.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Loved it, which is no big surprise If you like Michael Buble, you will love it. I hear it in many retail stores in the background and it puts a smile on my face!
B00766CMZM|4.0|The picking is excellent, the female vocals are delightful, the selections are mostly up tempo and the overall acoustic is well recorded and transparent on the LP, the CD is seemingly more flat in soundstage.  If you like roots blue grass with a modern presentation, then get some tasty Chocolate Drops!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best zombies ever.  I’ve loved the zombie since 1971.  It’s a thrill to have an on going movie, well TV show that I hope never ends.  Zombies Rock!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had never heard of this show. It I is outstanding and I plan to watch all the seasons. It is the best!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|All and all a good movie. My only problem with it is that its three hour long. but still worth watching
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is an amazing look @ aristocratic life in a whole new way! Downton Abbey is now my very favorite show & will be until someone else tops it which I doubt is possible! Can't wait for season4!
B00991TCOG|5.0|If you're reading this review, it means you've already seen Lindsey run around in the ice and snow, watched her dance with her own shadow, and gazed upon her trying to slay zombies with her violin because she thought it no sin.  Now you're wondering if you should buy the CD.  Well, the answer is a great big YES!  This is the only CD I've ever purchased that completely exceeded my expectations, and considering that I've watched every LindseyStomp YouTube video several times, my expectations were quite high.  I love every song on this CD.  After spending the day getting chased around the maze by the larger rats, it's so nice to pop the Lindsey CD in the player on the way home, and forget all about the rat race.  So what are you doing still reading this review?  The Stars are Aligned. Click that order button now!  You're only regret will be that you didn't order it earlier.  Soon you too will be going into the rat race singing da-da-da-da. There really is a reason why Lindsey gets such high reviews from everyone, well except for Piers Morgan, but what does he know?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show and it was recommended by Amazon.Com after ordering several other British shows but this one tops them all!!! Can't wait for season 4. i am anticipating longevity for this series in hopes we'll have a lifetime of memories together! WOW!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|What's not to love.  I have fun seeing the occasional guest star. I LOVE Sulu.  After the first couple of episodes where Jim takes himself and the show WAY to seriously, the humor leaks in and I am swept away to the sixties and beyoooooooond.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This app has never saved a single picture for me. Waste of 5 bucks. If the app was updated too fix this, it would be money will spent. However, judging by the other comments it's not likely to happen.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Very edgy very refreshing<br />This is completely different from just about any other sci-fi  you will come across.<br />Watch it!
B007N6NGYG|1.0|The game itself was very interesting and enjoyable. I got this as the FAOTD, and after playing it a bit and checking that it had nothing objectionable, and no in-app purchases, I added it to my children's FreeTime account (games that they can play when logged in). Much to my surprise, a few days later, an \\"update\\" had changed the game so that in app purchasing was very obvious. Even though it is blocked on my device (Kindle Fire 2nd gen), the kids got frustrated because they'd keep ending up in screens that they weren't allowed to do anything on.<br /><br />I also dislike the ability to get \\"free\\" in-game currency by completing \\"offers.\\" YUK!<br /><br />In addition, the game really DOES have a huge learning curve. The first puzzles are GREAT and I was really enjoying them, but as you move on, the gameplay takes a HUGE leap and suddenly you are no longer figuring things out by thinking about them. Instead, you are playing and crashing things multiple times in a vain attempt to learn which tunnels lead to which other locations, and what the (seemingly randomly assigned) delay will be before your train reappears. Those levels made me lose interest, as I don't like having to use trial and error 50+ times on a single level. It then becomes grindingly boring.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I've been giving this book series as a gift to my husband and he loves them, it's very hard for him to put them down. I love the show and just can't find time to read the books.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I love the HD filters and touch ups.  Season three is when the series really starts to take off and get good.  I recommend this to any TNG fan!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Then you might also hate flash-forwards too!  LOL  This movie takes almost a second look viewing it to catch all the nuances it portrays in each character.  Loved the scenery, the many different characters each actor played, some I was totally blown away by in the ending trailer, which showed who they were in the movie.  A busy, action packed movie, which takes total concentration and focus to not miss what is subtly hidden within the framework.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Nice app when the content will load. Always old news and never refreshes even when I do it manually. So I'll try another app for my news.
B008Y79HE6|4.0|I enjoyed that time was taken to think out of the box and create a new form of Godzilla, not the same old stereotype.  I think a lot of negative reviews were due to it not ending as almost every Godzilla movie made, but was more of a King Kong ending added to it.  I thought the action sequences were good.  Liked the actors, and some of the hidden comedic jokes that some younger generations might not reference, like to the Siskel and Ebertesque officials.  All in all, I've watched this multiple times and enjoy it when there is nothing good and action packed on TV.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Thumbs Up From All Book Club Members  Wonderful Story As Well As Very Informative  Enjoyed The Descriptions Of All The Flowers In Our Gardens
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I found the basic plot of the show kind of different and interesting, but was a bit &#34;Twilight-ish&#34;, not bad, but just dealing with young love.  I felt it needed better plot development about the family's supernatural heritage, powers, etc. than was given.  I did enjoy the two main characters the movie revolved around, and felt they needed further enhancement and depth to draw you deeper into the story line.  Also, some supernatural scenes were good, and others like the table spinning were kind of childish in it's conception, could have used a bit more fright to the scene to make it better.  All in all, not too bad, but no award nominee in my humble opinion.
B007VYAJAE|4.0|A great introspective biopic about the life and times of Mr Marley. Honest, dirty and pure. I loved it and grew from it.
B001QJOZP0|5.0|The Searchers and the Duke/John Ford classic continues to be a must see year over year. The streaming quality was great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is the best game Bc its so much fun to collect coins and get on trains and go threw tokayo
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Great cast. Enough humor to keep the serious subject from being too dark.  Jennifer Lawerence's perfomance is riveting, as well as Bradley Cooper's and DeNiro. Highly recommend this flick.
B00847KFDS|5.0|The cynic in me thought, oh here we go again, another R&R veteran cashing in on his old hits.  But then Rolling Stone rated this 5 stars and that got my attention.  And wow, this is just terrific.<br /><br />One mark of truly great songs (vs. great recordings) is that they can be reworked many times and sound fresh and new each time, as long as care is taken with the arrangement.  Case in point: Proud Mary.  The original with CCR, Tina Turner's smoking version, and the version here with Jennifer Hudson and a New Orleans all-star cast are all very different.  And each is exceptional.<br /><br />It becomes completely obvious after only one listen that Fogerty absolutely wanted to avoid the \\"cashing in\\" scenario.  This is a labor of love.  The first clue is that almost every song was recorded in a different studio, meaning Fogerty traveled to wherever was convenient for the collaborators to ensure that the recordings were done together live in the studio, not tacked on after-the-fact overdubs.  It makes a huge difference as the collaborators are clearly thrilled to be involved with one of the greatest rock-and-roll songwriters of all time.  You can't fake this.  For evidence, just listen to the Foo Fighters absolutely shred the opening track \\"Fortunate Son\\".  Is it possible to be filled with even more venom and bile than the original?  Apparently so, but who'd have thought it?<br /><br />Some of the tracks are quite true to the original, some deviate significantly.  No matter.  All are terrific.  There's also two lesser known solo songs and two new songs.  Thankfully, these are interspersed with the rest of the album, not just tacked on to the end as \\"bonus\\" tracks.  Those four songs might not be anthems that everybody knows by heart but they are damn good and kudos to Mr. Fogerty to ensuring they get some air time.<br /><br />I can safely say you shouldn't have to make a choice between the classic originals and the versions presented here.  Make sure to own them both.For old timers that still sometimes buy actual CDs and not just downloads, I recommend the CD because the booklet has excellent personal notes from Fogerty about each song.<br /><br />This is going to stay on my playlist for the summer of '13.
B00942Y0TM|5.0|Ok so my two year old is addicted this one. I wish they would make a part two. We have on all formats. DVD, blue ray, iTunes, and now amazom. This movie is so cute. No adult puns in this one. But a true look to your self movie that for little girls striving to find who they are will get a kick out of all the hair.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Awesome series.  Season one and two are amazing.  Waiting for season 3.  All of the actors/actresses are having fun with this series.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Loved the movie. very inspirational and entertaining. Great for the whole family! It can be a bit sad for very little children though.
B00A69JZQU|5.0|Very useful and interesting, I've read it very fast and very carefully to all the info provided.<br />Thanks Erik for your marvellous work.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The mystery twisted and turned as it led me along and kept the pages turning. I loved the length, I could really get into it without it wrapping up too soon. The ending brought satisfying resolution to the plot, while leaving an opening for more to come, which I am interested in, but which I hope will skip the language, though it was somewhat retrained compared to other works. As an aspiring writer myself, I found this story inspiring!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a bee very ADDICTIVE game!!!! U can play it 4 hours. It going to wonder where all the time went because u don't want 2 put it down!!! Another Great game from Big Fish!!!! A++++++
B001AMNL2Q|3.0|Director Stanley Kubrick was known for not pulling any punches except the punch line, which he did ably in Dr. Stangelove, or How I Learned to Love the Bomb. This straightforward diary exhibition lays open the experience of two different military venues. Kubrick pulls them off without fanfare but therein lies the drama. Probably just about everything Kubrick did, like Coppola and Friedkin, was good. It wasn't something I sought out, for some reason or other, just happened to see at someone's home. But now that I have seen it, feel i can say it is worth the view.
B00CDXOPYE|4.0|Another great story based on a Nicholas Sparks novel.  This story has a bit of mystery and suspense but it boils down to the love story.  I love Julianne Hough and it is great to see her in this role.  If you liked the Notebook and Dear John, you will add this to your list.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very well detailed, and organized. very eye opening and a quick read. I will most definitely read again in the very near future.
B001XV09UG|1.0|I think Kubrick was aiming for a Terry Gilliam style surrealism. I think. Whatever his goal, he seriously missed it. The dialogue is stilted and dull, the characters are 2D (if that) the plot bizarre and pointless, Cruise's character is an oddly zombie-like Mr Perfect and we're supposed to believe Nicole Kidman at her most stunning is a lonely housewife.<br /><br />I'm a Kubrick fan, I loved &#34;Dr Strangelove&#34; and &#34;Lolita&#34; and am totally fine with his more random and bizarre moviemaking moments. But this wasn't bizarre. It was just lame.
B000SFD21Q|5.0|Overall informative, easy to relate, and interesting! My son has early signs of ADHD and reading this has gotten me into more activities with him to see how it affects him! Big help!!!!
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|A fun series that keeps you interested. I love the cast and characters... Now I just want to see Bombshell on Broadway!
B000ICXQF6|3.0|Great movie, along the lines of the movie Contagion.  Fun to see Brad Pitt when he was starting out in hollywood
0374533571|4.0|I had hoped to read this book before seeing the movie, but ended up watching the movie first with family in town. I unequivocally preferred the book to the movie, which I'll eventually expound upon in a blog post, but as a Philadelphian, I cannot quite give it five stars for two reasons:<br /><br />1) Protagonist Pat Peoples' scary, life-threatening experience in North Philly.<br /><br />2) The immediate aftermath of reason #1 above.<br /><br />While the movie makes at least one much more egregious Philly related mistake in its attempt at compressing multiple parts of the book into one scene, Pat's traumatizing, physically damaging North Philly episode came off to me as unrealistic and unconvincing, playing too easily into common stereotypes before his impossibly serendipitous reunion with his pal Danny.<br /><br />The above thoughts aside (and I'll admit that the above thoughts involve only a very small portion of the book, and that perhaps I'm overly sensitive about fictional depictions of my hometown), I loved the book. From Pat's Collingswood based family to Quick's close writing of the tailgate scene at the Linc to Pat's stated preference for his eponymous cheesesteak shop over Geno's (I like Pat's Steaks better than Geno's too, as do most of my friends, though all of us would rather go to Jim's or a lesser known spot, and the true signature Philly sandwich has become roast pork anyway, but I digress....), the book presents an authentic group of Philly personalities. By its end, I found myself rooting for Pat to get over Nikki and get with Tiffany, and I even got kinda choked up at some random moments that struck me to the gut for no particular reason. Quick's got good stuff, and I'll surely be reading some of his other books.<br /><br />Finally, I really loved how the action followed the Eagles' 2006 season, a season I remember very well, a season when Andy Reid, after McNabb's injury, finally increased his run to pass ratio to relatively normal levels, and the Eagles nearly got past the Saints with Jeff Garcia at the helm in the second round of the playoffs. Well done, Matthew Quick.e Eagles nearly got past the Saints with Jeff Garcia at the helm in the second round of the playoffs. Well done, Matthew Quick.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|it is so amazing . I play it all day everyday.I saw the movie and the game and the way the movie and the game relates is amazing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best tv show I have come to encounter in years! You need to see the whole series right now!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I hope to find more like it. I'm not a gamer but I honestly did nothing else today. It had me completely absorbed.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|Not worth watching. Bad movies seem to be a norm from Hollywood now. This movie is not one of the better movies available now. Very boring, little to find here.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It is awesome because they added some new stuff and it rocks like a jetpack and new cars that's IT
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I've never been the fastest of readers, but I read this in less than a week.  I HEARD bits and pieces of the second book on Sirius and wanted to read the first book. I wasn't disappointed. I had trouble putting it down.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It helps me and reminds me to charge my kindle when I get to focused on my apps . It is very helpful.  So my kindle is always charged.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it is very addictive and fun. The only con is the stages are a lot of coins and  so are there vehicles.
B005MHHREI|2.0|Wild Swans was a fascinating book, and I hoped that the book on Mao would also be as interesting. I didn't get far enough to give my opinion on the authors' interpretation of history. I found the book to be very tedious and gave up on it fairly quickly.
B005K17RU0|3.0|This app provides more weather information than most people want or need stretched out over several pages, making it difficult to comprehend at a glance. A single screen (or page) for each locattion of interest giving outside air temperature and humidity with a standard 24-hour forecast would be preferable. However, it should also include warnings of severe weather.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|For me this is one of the most captivating dramas that I've seen on television in a long time....there is a great cast, and the characters all have personal issues that are interwoven into the general plot which seems simply to be national security....the almost 'paranoid' quality of not trusting anybody is both disturbing and also feels real for people who function at that level.
1400064287|5.0|Excellent book. Focus on 6 principles of making great ideas stick.  Good, practical suggestions that are doable. I highly recommend it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I am holding my breath until the new season starts. I am never disappointed with Supernatural. I cant get enough.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|A great show to watch. I'm glad that it is on Amazon Prime, gives me something to watch in the wee hours while up with the baby, makes the time fly. Love the show and the actors.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is a lady who isn't perfect and tries her best to be a good mother while trying to make it in the legal profession.  I love the way she always maintains her composure even when she's blind sided by almost impossible odds.
B0000549B0|5.0|Have loved this movie for years!  Had the honor to play the aunt in a community theatre production of &#34;Harvey&#34; - made me love the movie even more.  I love everything Jimmy Stewart has ever done!
B003Y8YXEO|2.0|If you have LEGEND: The Very Best of John Lennon, hang onto it because it is a better CD in terms of tracklisting and remastering. This CD 'Power to the People' is a pointless upgrade because the remastering is lacklustre and they have not included all the hits, despite the room. A CD allows 80 minutes, so why did they stop at just under 60 minutes? Why not give the fans more? The photo on the front is good but it is odd that everyone associates him with New York, when he actually came from England. Missing key tracks include 'Beautiful Boy', and 'Nobody Told Me'. Why not include these and more when their is actually room? Shame on the remastering, it is very poor when compared with LEGEND.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best game for your money.... can't wait for the next one to come out ! Wish they had more now though... I really wish they would hurry and make.  New one
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Trekkies be damned.  This refresh of the original is well worth watching.  The characters are true to the originals and the dialog is spirited and funny where it needs to be.  Effects are great and some situations are really over the top. A good viewing for Star Trek fans of any era.  By the way, I grew up on the original series in the '60's and this is as fresh as the original was then.
B004WMKSH2|3.0|Hard to follow if you aren't a die hard harry potter fan, but it was good enough to make me want to watch the second part :)
B00CW665VI|5.0|I can not stress enough how totally freakin amazing this book was. Wow, just wow! This was written solely from the male POV and it was brilliantly done.<br />At first I thought Drew Evans was an arrogant, skirt chasing, a******. I was thinking \\"how am I ever going to like this character\\"? He was so conceited and I just wanted to nut punch him. Oh, but then as the story progresses my tune changed really quick.<br />I loved Kate and the way she didn't take any **** from him. She was smart , beautiful and did not back down from a challenge.<br /><br /> \\"I don't plan on being one of your groupies or a notch on your bedpost, so you can save your lines, your smile, and your bs for someone else.\\"<br /><br />This was the funniest book I have read so far this year. Laughed so hard I cried. For example, Drew's POV on Cinderella ...<br /><br />\\"A mindless twit who can't even remember where she left her damn shoe, so she has to wait for some douchebag in tights to bring it to her? Give me a figging break.\\"<br /><br />This author has mad writing skills and I can't wait to read more from her. Great, amazing , fantastic.. yeah, you get the picture. Go get this one.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|A well done documentary. I enjoyed learning about the band's history, the individuals, their struggles and  challenges....and listening to the music.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I loved Cat's independence and the respect she had from her men. Bones was charming and confident, just the way I love a man. This was a fun tale to read. I look forward to reading more from Jeaniene.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Complex characters you come to know and care deeply about, a harsh and unforgiving physical environment, a history of horror and violence, and a uniquely distorted social structure that arises inevitably from the past. Compelling story-telling at its very best!
B009Y7YC2M|5.0|The Pro version lets you adjust the mic (input) gain. I find this feature very useful, although you can set and and forget it too if you prefer.  The user interface is excellent - very intuitive.  At the top are two words - Recorder and Player. Tapping either of these words puts the app in Record or Play mode.  In Record mode, a large blue mic symbol appears in the center of the screen.  Touching it starts the recorder and while it is recording the mic is red.  Touching the mic icon again pauses the recording and the mic is blue again.  When you have finished recording, you touch the square stop button.  If you want to make another recording, you touch the blue mic icon again and repeat the above process.  If you want to play your recordings, you touch the Player icon at the top and use the normal media player icons to control playback.  Excellent App. I usually then transfer the .wav files to my laptop, sometimes for further editing or perhaps adding the audio to video files on my laptop.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really enjoyed this series and I'm looking forward to whatever Hugh Howey has coming next. I have to confess to staying up WAY too late a couple of nights with this darn bood.  So impressed that he managed to write a super story and keep control of the publishing reins to the extent that he did.
0670014893|4.0|Enjoyed ;the book, but it was not one of his best. I hope he can write several more during the twilight of his career.
0061537934|5.0|This book was given to me by a friend.  It moved me sufficiently that I purchased a copy to give away too.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Alice In Chains return with a very strong new album full of down tuned riffs and excellent harmony vocals that combine to make a worthy addition to their impressive discography. The band definitely stays true to their roots and delivers an album that any fan would expect and desire of a band with such a clearly defined sound. The album was produced by Nick Raskulinecz and Alice In Chains to create a very big sound with lots of interesting layers and a crystal clear sound mix. Highlights include the big groove of opener \\"Hollow\\", the powerful main riff of \\"Stone\\", the strong vocal melodies of \\"Voices\\", the nice build up from the dark verses into the brighter chorus of \\"Low Ceiling\\", and the dark winding riff of \\"Hung On A Hook\\". Despite the obvious change in vocalist on their latest albums, this lineup of Alice In Chains has to be commended for releasing two very strong albums and forging a future for a band that continues to do things their way. This new album is highly recommended to all Alice In Chains fans and anyone who likes dark dirty rock riffs characteristic of the Seattle sound - 4.5 stars.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Vampire Weekend's third record sees the band stretch their musical reach considerably beyond their (excellent) previous efforts.  Rostam Batmanglij's musical arrangements are consistently excellent and Ezra Koenig's lyrical concerns are more mature but retain the band's trademark quirky, irreverent and smart flavor.  A must have.  If you get a chance, you should also see them in concert.  One of today's best bands both in the studio and in live performance.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I did not see this at the theater.  I did see how many awards it got at the Oscars.  I took a shot by purchasing it.  I took it with me on vacation.  It is great.  I shared it with another couple.  They enjoyed the movie also.  I will watch it again and again!
B0065CCM76|4.0|For a while in the seventies and the early eighties, Bob Seger was a veritable fountain of songs which would define the now equally revered and reviled 'Classic Rock' category.<br /><br />Much like Springsteen, Seger concerned with the plight of the everyday man.  Lyrically, in my opinion, Seger is not as accomplished or ambitious as Springsteen, but Seger's vocal abilities far outstrip those of the Boss and  Seger was, perhaps, more capable of penning instant classics that were more accessible to mass audiences (at least until Springsteen's 'Born in the USA' came around).<br /><br />This ultimate hits collection gives a true taste of the accomplishments of Seger in the seventies.  His most popular songs suffer a little from overexposure ('Old Time Rock and Roll', 'Hollywood Nights', 'Night Moves') or from ill-advised commercial associations ('Like a Rock') but, overall, Seger's canon is consistently excellent and the tracks in this collection well chosen.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I bought the movie because I loved it at the theater.  I like to watch what I love when I want it!
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|My girl wanted the version where you can see the handle on the paddle. I bought the paid version. It works, iscute, gives you settings to change the colors and paddle options, from the glow to standard (like the regular table we all played on). Soxtheres. Not an option where the paddle glows AND shows the handle, you have to select the standard table for that. Dont know if that will matter to anyone but hey , shes 5. All in all ok just not as many settings of tables Id like.
1400069289|4.0|Without spoiling the book too much I will say that the author Charles Duhigg did a great job explaining the science behind habit and offered some solutions to change the bad ones and continue the good ones. I found the section on self-discipline very interesting as well and the new discoveries scientist have found. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the habits of humans and why people do what they do.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I downloaded this game for my niece (who is three) and it was a little to much for her, she got impatient. before I deleted it I though I would check it out. Omg I'm so addicted its like farmville but with nemo love it!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I found this mouse while searching for a mouse for a disabled user. I was reluctant to get a gamer's mouse but i am so happy with it.It allows me to customize the weight because I need a heavier mouse. I am enjoying the ability to customize the side buttons and I really the ease of the movement of the mouse.I would recommend this mouse to anyone.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Tom Cruise isn't 6'3&#34; but he pulled it off.  I sort of remember the plot froum the book and found few in the movie.
B0052YAKS6|5.0|I love David Guetta and this cd is the bomb. Great beats and fun to dance to. The purchase was awesomw and the shipping was fast.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Quentin Tarentino does &#34;Blazing Saddles&#34; in the south.  Rock-em sock-em blood and gore all over the old south and West.
B000001DQI|5.0|What can you say about Elton, this is one fantastic album with many big hits.  Makes me very nostalgic and brings back lots of good memories.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen! Very addictive and highly recommended. The acting is superb and the story is amazing.
B00005214X|5.0|Original George Harrison, independant of the Beatles which I will always be passionate of, but great as an independant artist.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I love this show! I watch it on my kindle instead of working and i appreciate it being Prime. Would definitely recommend and once I'm caught up, I'll follow it regularly
B005CKPQNE|5.0|this got me caught up on this show...It is really good. And I cant wait for the new season to start.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can choose to keep books on my phone, or in the cloud.  It remembers where I am in the book when I am reading from my phone, and then when I open the book on my tablet, it takes me directly to the last page I read.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I found this book just okay - disappointed as having heard a lot about it prior to reading was expecting a much better read.<br /><br />B Murray
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I know I can create a favorite, however I'd love it if you could have the app return to the page you last visited when the app was closed.  Other than that, it's a great app!
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I love it<br />This third Chronicle is my type of book.  The storyline keeps you interested and keen to get to the end.<br />Would definitely recommend the series.<br /><br />B Murray
076244911X|5.0|This is a gourgeous &#34;coffee table&#34; anthology packed with beautiful photography documenting Kylie's influence on fashion and beauty, including her most elaborate stage costumes and commercial dancewear and lingerie. Top quality printing and book binding, this is a large volume with just enough text to explain the lavish photos, biographical details and backstage production. Fans of Kylie, Pop Culture, Fashion and Glamour will all treasure this!!!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is one of a kind magic in a bottle series.  The casting, the costumes, the scenery. Everything about this show is an A+. Can't wait for season 2
B000LTAY1U|1.0|This is the second review I have written.  Amazon needs to pay attention.<br />I have returned the watch for a refund.  The watch is too small.  It is more of a kids watch.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Me and my wife both loved this movie. I don't want to give away anything if you've not watched it. But if your a horror movie fan it's a must watch.
B00336Y7ZW|5.0|I laughed until I cried. Talked about it all day I never heard so many funny one liners in such a short time
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love love this show.  I could never stop laughing after washing one of these epsoides.  Keep up the good work.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I loved the book series and was glad the movie followed the book.  Looking forward to the sequel.  When can we expect the sequel?
B000HZD168|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the movie and comparing it to Into Darkness. The ear scene still gets me, every time!
0062183591|2.0|I cannot express how disappointed I was in this book. It's not even a descriptive enough word for how I feel actually. It's like Ariely's writing just goes downhill with each book. I LOVED his first book. I have read it several times, so I know it's not just initial interest in the subject matter! The second book was okay but not great. This book just seemed like a compilation of the two books, some personal stories - which are beginning to sound like \\"pity me\\" tales - and a whole lot of nothing. The experiments are all mainly the off shoots of the same simplistic experiment which I didn't really think was that good in the first place. While GOOD experimentation should be \\"I tried \\"A\\", I got this result . I tried \\"A\\" again and got the same result (repeat several times) so MAYBE it means XXXX.\\" Instead they try one thing on one small group of people (college graduate students) and state that this DEFINITELY means XXXXXX. Yes, I'm trying to avoid spoilers. Since I could immediately thing of several other possible reasons \\"A\\" could have happened, it didn't seem like great science OR a very well written book. Time to write your \\"Eating Over the Kitchen Sink\\" book Dan!
B003EYVXT6|5.0|This movie is off the chain and out of the ordinary. They went beyond the realm of alien life and gave you something to think about when you watch this movie.  Try it, you will like it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Anyone who loves British PBS series will love Downton Abbey! A must watch; all of series are exceptional ( although I don't like the ending in series 3)...
B003YOZNBU|4.0|If you like a western style movie, you should see this one, interesting movie, Recommend you seeing it.  Satisfied customer.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait till the next one! Can't put it down, better story line than a fifty Shades. Totally recommend it!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|You'll see Ron Howard ( great Hollywood director, who also played Opie on the old Andy Griffith shows) as a little boy.  The beautiful voice of Shirley Jones in one of her first movies is wonderful.  Nothing like the old musicals
B00846REIS|5.0|Got to read the other book! The third book comes out in June! I can not wait to read it!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I personally very much enjoyed the Comic first and for most. The art style made it at times hard for me to follow and I personally didn't care for all the news segments in the comic. I understand what the artist was going for with them and the complete shock to a city it would be. Just not my cup of tea. So I was very interested when I first saw that these films were being made. As a visual enhancement to the story being told, I extremely enjoyed the film. As a Batman fan I very much enjoyed the film/comic and the story being told. I also feel (personally) that the movie holds up well in its own regards. I'm very much looking forward to the second part and hope its par for the course.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|For those of you who love 'The Bard', this is an interesting explanation of true events.  Why did Ben Johnson publish a collection of Shakespere's work while William was alive?  Why did only Ben receive profits from the publication?  Perhaps because Shakespere didn't actually write any of the works that bear his name?
B00A0MJ9VY|5.0|Peter Pan is a Family favorite. The movie is so crystal clear, it's was even better than before. Watch when ever we can. Thank you Disney.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Really good although I don't like  that we have to give a review but overall it is a okay game the quality could be better as well
B006M4F67A|3.0|GOT ON MY KINDLE- REMOVED- SORRY- HARD TO SEE ON KINDLE-DIDN'T TRY TO HARD-HAVE OTHER MAHJONG GAMES BETTER THAN THIS ONE
0385528752|4.0|Very  good book that helps one understand how others perceive change and what is od value to many individuals. his book should be read by all managers and their teams.
B00785P2QC|2.0|DIDN'T LIKE THIS GAME- DIDN'T TRY TO MUCH- NOT EASY TO SEE ON KINDLE- SO I TOOK OFF MY KINDLE
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Having an autistic child, and not having HBO to see this when it was first shown, I was dying to see this. We watched it right away when we received it! Excellent movie!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great bought it dozens of times. I do understand it is still under development but sometimes the signs glitch and all you see is the text. Which can be annoying but overall I give it five stars.
B00005JNX0|5.0|The whole family loved this movie! Another great one by dream works!! Thanks for the fun movie for the entire family!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Wild tale, not really believable, but maybe the convergence of another story might lead to the truth.  However, the original story is truly visually and intellectually stimulating.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I remember seeing the previews for this movie, and knew my boys would love it since it is based around video games. I never expected it to be one of my 3 year old daughters favorite movies!!
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Funny, yes, but not very actual.  For a couple facing financial ruin, they live as if the local bank was their private domain.  However, the laughs make the whole thing worthwhile.  But I did expect more from Paul Rudd.
B00942Y0TM|5.0|After renting this movie several times, and the kids still asking to see it, I decided it was time to buy it. My kids absolutely love this movie!
B009CF3MEK|4.0|A bit more believable tale of the idle rich in the roaring 20's.  And what cars they drove!  But Jay Gatsby gets his in the end, or the chest, or something.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|My 3 year old daughter requested this purchase, and has not stopped talking about it since she watched it the first time!
B0009P42UK|4.0|I loved watching the Dark Crystal growing up and so added this to my daughter's PSP collection.  We love Jim Henson.
0525953728|5.0|This book is history in the making and Mark Owen put himself in harms way, also to publish this book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Incredibly written. Can nit wait to see the film. I recommend this.book to anyone looking for a story with a happy.ending
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I like this app but would like a way to add custom sounds. Profiles would be nice and helpful. Sounds are  clear and like to mix them.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|The first book is a slow start, but the second and third are excellent, particularly the second. Very hard to stop reading.
B007F8L450|5.0|My daughter and her friends love this beach house. Got a car and lots of clothes plus a few extras like pets and they have a blast playing.
B0090SI4OC|2.0|I was eagerly anticipating this movie. I knew it would never live up to the book but in my opinion, it fell far short. I felt no chemistry for the lead couples, in fact I had a hard time figuring out which guy was which. Sadly, will not buy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzle! Makes you think. Totally worth the $1.99 I paid for it. I love having to use the eye piece to see things I wouldn't be able to see otherwise. A work out for the brain.
B00B2064IY|5.0|Jimmy Hendrix is back, great album with some guest vocals. very dervirse,a very talented guitar player and writer, holds up to modern rock today
B008MWBY6W|2.0|I purchased this camera bag for a big international trip, because I wanted something slightly more robust than the current bag I was using.  Unfortunately, the strap connection broke almost as soon as I started using it. The ease and speed with which it broke, makes it seem that it was just defective from the factory, and not necessarily a design flaw.  Nevertheless, I had to carry the bag in my hand the remainder of the trip so I'm not pleased.<br /><br />Strap aside, its a bit of an odd shape, and felt like a lot of space was wasted and unusable.
B00BVYLBP2|3.0|It's easy to start watching, but the further I get into the story the more confused I get. I will stick it out.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really needed an app that I could use offline for noting notes or even writing a little. Works wonderfully! My notes are so organized too, with the notebooks keeping topics separated.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book had me cracking up start to finish. Loved the male POV. Quick read that has you captivated start to finish and rooting for Drew to succeed!
B002DGV6KW|5.0|I used this book in college, then missed it after giving my copy to a family member.  It is so thorough, with its background, explanations (on appropriate pages), and easy reading.  I haven't seen any other that puts it all together so well.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|Very long tale, a lot of minutia.  Descriptive of the fifties but King inserts his excessive liberal derogatory comments about the era.  Pure escapism as I grew up in the fifties, and sure, no era is perfect, there will NEVER be utopia but sometimes political jabs don't fit the bill
0517053616|1.0|I bought this only because it was cheap and I wanted something in a hurry.  I looks nice, but is hard to read and has an annoying feature wherein, to save space, if there is only one word left in a paragraph, it is but above the next to last word, instead of continuing to the next line....you sort of have to read it a bit backwords at that point.  The overall effect is that text is squeezed in to get more on a page (and type is small to begin with).  Thankfully, I have since found a much better book to replace it.
B005DOL0R0|2.0|I thought that it would zip all the way to open as a book.  not so  plus the interior design left marks on screen
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A story so gripping that as hard as the subject matter might be to think about, one must know the outcome.
1594745692|4.0|I did my first reading with this deck just three days ago. I got the death card as my future. Now, knowing a bit about tarot, I wasn't worried, because the death card often just signifies change. Little did I know what change they meant.<br /><br />The glossy, high quality card had other plans in store. The reaction started at my fingertips, the ones that touched the card. I started noticing a numbness, and a greyish tinge to my skin. I was alarmed the next day when it had spread up my arm during the night, and was fully covering my chest. I am glad that the box the cards came in was sturdy and well constructed, because I dropped the set several times trying to do another reading that would give me a different outcome. It was always the same however... death.<br /><br />It's now three days later, and I am, as the song says, comfortably numb. I find I have incredible pain tolerance, which is probably good because parts of my skin have begun to blacken and decay. It doesn't really bother me though. I am too distracted by the hunger.<br /><br />-1 star for the blue-grey lividity of my skin not matching my wardrobe.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Not better than the original but still a solid movie. Robert Downey Jr. is very entertaining, to say the least.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|I find a USB stick a handier method of storing music than SD card, mainly because every system in the world has a usb port, and usb sticks are dirt cheap. I use this in my 2011 Golf TDI to listen to MP3's via the stock deck. The device plugs into the center console armrest, and the usb stick and wire are enclosed by the console lid, so there is nothing to jar or get lost.<br /><br />It just works.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|yes, maybe the story line is old but the visuals are so great! trully wnjoyed it in a therater and at home (not in 3D)
B00CS65JS2|5.0|If you're a musique fan, then make a good decision and buy this album immediately. Do not hesitate one more second.
B000MDDSB8|5.0|i had been looking for this movie on line for a while; happy to find it on Amazon. love the movie - its somewhat like twilight with lesser drama, more action, and with a purpose. great witchcraft flick
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I loved everything about this movie.  Loved the music and the comedy was LOL.  Memorable unique characters, good writing, clever and witty.  Will def buy this movie, I want to watch it again.  Me and my boyfriend were laughing our butts off.  Classic!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it love it!  I play it every day and have also got my mom and sister hooked. Would recommend to any die hard bingo fans.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Donald Trump hated this film and basically carved his oppinion in tacky gold lined marble rock.  I watched a couple minutes of it and right away knew it was classic QT.  Can't wait to buy it and watch it all the way thru.  Donald Trump is still bringing up Pulp Fiction saying \\"now THAT'S a GOOD movie.  He is so behind the times, this is another classic by QT.  Donald is still carrying on about Pulp Fiction if that tells you anything.
B009X01D9U|5.0|I love my orange case!!!  Fits my Kindle Fire HD like a glove, and I love being able to rotate the sleeve any way I need in order to use my Kindle most effectively.  My Kindle feels very well-protected in this case, I recommend it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My kids can't wait to play it on my android tablet.  It's a fun game for all three of them.
0765325950|5.0|I will keep this short, as otherwise I could go on for paragraphs.  But this really is a great finale to a fantastic, sprawling series.  Sanderson really wrapped up Jordan's masterpiece beautifully.  Where Jordan tended to get derailed with too many details, Sanderson stayed true to Jordan while driving the book forward at a strong pace, exactly where it needed to go.  As expected, there are many losses--some may complain that there is no real time spent mourning for the lost in the book, but I feel that it feels more realistic to a massive battle.  There was simply NO time for characters to brood on the losses of loved ones, but they were not trivialized.  The only part of the book that I felt moved way too quickly was at the end, with all the business up at Shayol Ghul/Thakan'dar.  The epilogue was also a bit awkward, and ended too fast--I would have loved to learn more about what characters were feeling and what was to come for them, but I guess it's alright to imagine the different possibilities for them.  Really was an enjoyable read overall!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|This thing rocks.... from packaging , to product feel... the LED lights that show activity  everything is well done... I have a Windows 8 laptop one of the very thin ones.... and do not have the chance to buy peripherals that require CDs to load the drivers.... for W8  this is Plug and Play....  Initially I  I tried a $12 option and 1) they shipped a different one than the one featured on the photo and was not plug and play....  needless to say that I returned it right away....  the Anker one  works perfectly!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I am a lover of User-Friendly concept especially because I am from electronic Horse-N-Buggy Days.  I found it very easy to acclimate to the format when I have only experience with my history of PCs and no formal schooling in computer skills since 1970s.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved the book just as I loved the first one. I know a lot of people have bad things to say about it, but it kept my attention and was a good read. I read it in about three, three and a half hours. :-)
B009UX2YAC|3.0|ITS A LITTLE SLOW AND YOU CAN ONLY PLAY WHEN WIFI IS CONNECTED TO IT ... BUT ITS OKAY MY KIDS LOVE IT
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season keeps you on the edge of your seat and dying to watch more one before bed. My husband and I can't hardly wait until season 4 comes out this Fall.

B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|What a terrible movie, I only got about 20 minutes in and stopped to see if I could return it. I usually like Tom Hanks but the acting was just awful. Some of the worst acting I've ever seen from Tom Hanks. Maybe it was just a terrible script and he had nothing to work with. It was the type of bad movie where I just felt really pissed off that I spent $4 to watch it.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Been with them over 10yrs..however, they don't always come thru in what they say they do.  When my account was broken into, I tried to recover emails via troubleshooting and contact. I loss something very dear n important. I now printout important emails. Kinda defeats the purpose.
093183841X|4.0|A big one with a lot of camera's!<br />Very nice but also very expensive, but the last one I bought was from 1993.......! So this one will do till 2025. haha
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I bought the first seven seasons of Bones and have been watching them in order.  It takes a while.  I just started Season 5 and the 4th disc is bad.  The sign on the screen actually says &#34;BAD DISC&#34; when you try to load it.  Can't see it.  Can't get a refund or exchange either, what's the deal?  I bought it April 20 and the refund date has expired.  You sell bad stuff and won't stand behind it.  All I want is another Season 5, no refund just another Season 5.  The ratings for AMAZON.com, is the first star.<br /><br />Sue Wilhite
0618918248|5.0|Any theist or atheist should pick this up and ponder the the questions that you are put up with after you read this book. All my friends love it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Bought this book for a book club I am in.  We read the book prior to going to see the movie!  Like all books, this one is much better than the movie!
B001NLL93W|5.0|The story is well written,it's a good story, keeps you interested. I couldn't put it down until I finished it.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Not really sure what else there is to say!  I loved reading this book!  Highly recommend it for others to read!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes books about killing. I loved this book read in about 3 days!!!!!!!!!!!!AMAZING
B00BF11STU|5.0|We watched 60 minutes this past Sunday and then watched this movie. It was great how accurate the story on the movies was to the 60 Minutes interview was. And the movie was so engaging. Didn't realize how long it was until it was over. Plus, if we had rented it on Comcast it would have been $2.00 more expensive. Thanks Amazon.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I plan to read more in the series.  Reacher is an interesting main character.  Good story lines.  Easy to read.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Because the theater production of War Horse was being shown near by I was interested in the story.  Unfortunately I could not attend the play, but maybe some day.  I would love to see the story come to life.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book reveals real people Placed in a time different from our own and yet totally understandable and real. I've enjoyed it immensely and have learned a lot
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|While reading this book, at every page I could see my company :)  it's very relevant to my world and I am sure that's the feedback of most people who have  read it.<br />While it's slightly lengthy, I really enjoyed reading it. This looks like a textbook which you would have  to read at least coupled  of times to understand fully, relate and implement.
B008P3SPVU|4.0|Too bad it's the exception, not the rule.  Discipline brings focus/Focus brings success.  Game action is predictable but interactions of characters makes the movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love it. It's a great game. funfun. engaging. Fun. Cool. Love it! A great way to relax. I rate this game high on the list.<br />Tang o
044024367X|1.0|I first met Jack Reacher a couple of years ago and became a fan immediately. The stories are gripping, fast-moving and Reacher himself, though (duh) unrealistic, is a neato character. And after all the villains are unrealistic too, but they are so incredibly evil it is fun to watch their get their come-uppance. Love the plots etc.<br /><br />Anyway, what the HELL was Lee Child thinking on this one?<br /><br />First off, Reacher spends the book going back and forth between two towns named Hope & Despair. Is Lee Child trying to have some kind of retarded super-obvious symbolism here, because it was laughable.<br /><br />Second, Reacher not only is in favor of deserters from the Military here but actually says HE would have deserted if he had the guts. Really?! Come ON, people. That is not in any part of Reacher's formerly-described character. Plus I find it hard to see how, in a volunteer military, desertion can be defended.<br /><br />Third, one of the towns has what amounts to an underground railroad spiriting the vast hordes of military deserters out of the EEEEVIL war that Child doesn't like. This is straight from fantasyworld. I mean, I know Jack Reacher is sort of in fantasy world anyway, but usually there are some links to reality.<br /><br />Finally, apparently Lee Child has absolutely no idea what fundamentalist Christians are like. The villain is an evangelist trying to bring on the Rapture. I am not a believer in the Rapture myself (to me, it is clearly a 20th century misinterpretation of a few verses of scripture). But even if you DO believe in the Rapture, no Christian would try to \\"bring it on\\". That's not our job.<br /><br />What a clinker. Does not fit any part of the Jack Reacher we knew before. I also note that of the surprising 120 5-star reviews of this turd, over 40 of them appeared in the first few months of 2013. I suspect an organized attempt to rehabilitate this awful disappointment of a book. That's a conspiracy theory I can actually believe,instead of the one that is touted here.<br /><br />The first Jack Reacher book that I didn't keep in my library - it's off to resale. I'm sorry I ever bought it. It is also the first Jack Reacher book I didn't bother to finish. I got pretty close to the end, then I suddenly realized that I didn't care what happened to the bad guys. Or the good guys. Or anyone. You know, in a \\"real book\\" you are supposed to get MORE interested the nearer you get to the climax. What hath Lee Child wrought.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I thought this would be like all the other match 3 games. I was pleasantly surprised that ut was challenging and fun. Finished the gene way too quickly because I couldn't.t put it down.
B0054SMID0|4.0|enjoyed it.  liked the idea of working from the car.  liked the characters and the plot.  movie was over before I knew it.
B003UESJFG|3.0|good, would recommend it to my friends(if they have a sense of humor).  It is very entertaining, you will enjoy it.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|What do you expect from Boz Scaggs but nice tunes very well done.  That said, I would never have expected to hear a pair of my favorite Mink DeVille numbers covered so nicely.  It's good to know there are artists you can trust.

B00124BNF4|5.0|I didn't realize there were so many talking heads in this band but then I saw the album cover and realized that it makes sense. They have so many layers to the songs that they need this many to sing them.
B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|Bryson himself admits that he has no other goal in writing this book than to show everyone that Australia is strangely awesome. And how strangely awesome it is. A short list of wonderful things I learned:<br /><br />1. the Aborigine people have the oldest culture on Earth, probably dating to at least 40,000 years. They crossed the sea to Australia using god-knows what maritime technology at a time when Neanderthals still existed. Yet no one remembers this remarkable accomplishment. Indeed, not remembering the Aborigines is an Australian pastime and a dark spot on their otherwise congenial culture.<br /><br />2. the flora and fauna found there are abundant and diverse. Stromatolites, platypi, \\"only\\" fourteen species of venomous snakes, cute and cuddly wallabies, and tons of species that will likely never be recorded because...<br /><br />3. Australia is HUGE. Astoundingly large. And in addition to being a hulking continent/country/island hybrid land mass, it is empty. An immense void in the Pacific.<br /><br />4. many explorers have gotten lost in the Outback, and desperately thirsty, have deigned to drink their own urine and the urine of their companions. Important lesson for any potential explorers: the salt in the urine will actually exacerbate your thirst.<br /><br />5. Australia is the least wooded continent aside from Antarctica yet it is the world's largest exporter of woodchips.<br /><br />Being a Bryson book, it has hilarious moments. I envy this man's ability to collect the most ridiculous true stories and encounter the most interesting real people. I have so many highlighted bits, but here's a funny paragraph where Bryson, obsessed with the plethora of lethal creatures out to kill him in Oz, discusses the Australians' attitudes toward them:<br /><br />  \\"Australians are very unfair in this way. They spend half of any conversation insisting that the country's dangers are vastly overrated and that there's nothing to worry about, and the other half telling you how six months ago their Uncle Bob was driving to Mudgee when a tiger snake slid out from under the dashboard and bit him on the groin, but that it's okay now because he's off the life support machine and they've discovered he can communicate with eye blinks.\\"<br /><br />Reading one of Bill Bryson's travelogues is always a fantastic time. You laugh, you learn, you marvel. He stuffs your head with useless trivia and reminds you how valuable our world and our fellow people are. I need to stop reading his books because I always finish and make haste to airline sites, researching plane prices for impossible journeys, adding another place to my lengthy Must-See-Before-Dead list. But I can't stop. He's perfect at what he does
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Let me say with no reservation that the awesomosity of this album is unbounded. Wowza! (And now Amazon is telling me that 5 more words are &#34;required&#34; and so I'll toss in a few more for good measure! Consider it a lagniappe.)
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Great story line and many twists and turns along with great characters.  This series keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B005C0DHEY|3.0|A lot of propaganda materials after I saw the documentary FrackNation also that refuted most of the claims in this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really fun. I cant stop playing it until I have to. Its very addicting I love this game.
B0058SNI94|5.0|Wonderfully comfortable shoes. Very stylish shoes. I am very pleased with the shoes. I would recommend the shoes to others.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love minecraft but the should really like make it were we can join servers like on the computer that would draw more coustermours in pls hurry up on it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was a very fun game , I really think people will like it and should be willing to only spend there time to download and play this game .
B00000DCHI|5.0|Excellent CD for sure.  If you like Billy Joes you will love this cd.  It is a double cd with great songs.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Saw the commercials, looked like a very good movie.  I did not enjoy the movie as I thought I would of, from the previews on TV.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This cd makes you dance.  I love the uniqueness of the songs and styles of the music on the cd.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I bought this movie for my kids. They had never seem it. I grew up with this movie. I wanted to watch it with my kids. They loved it!

B006ZE66P8|5.0|My dauther realy love this story! Im glad she try it, cause she is very exited to say the story she read!
0887431453|5.0|This is a great preschool book that teaches the important things needed to know for kindergarten and is much cheaper than preschool!
B00AG297GK|3.0|The movie was better than I expected. A good watch if you are bored and have nothing better to do. Sacha Cohen is more &#34;subdued&#34; in this move versus his more popular films; a good thing in my book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's a great app but if you can visit random otter parks, you should be able to leave the gift jems their.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is by far the most witty book I have read in AGES!  I laughed out loud so many times and the thought processes of Drew were fabulous. I loved that Kate was such a strong character and the interaction between Drew and Mackenzie was priceless!  When I am texting and calling my friends during a book telling them to drop everything and order this book, you know it's a MUST READ!!
B003TOMAPC|2.0|Just another story retold in another way. Gets old fast. Becomes very unbelievable and predictable. If a movie isn't somewhat believeable  its hard to watch .
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is great and very action packed and suspenseive its a great way to kill time reading so i recimend it
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved this book!!! It's a must read. Had me interested after the first sentence and I couldn't put it down.
B0064QNS62|1.0|I really did not care for this game on principle more than anything. I realized pretty quick that the game wasn't for me when Marv hit the bugs with his pickaxe and there was blood. Blech! Never been too fond of any video game like that. Sorry Marv, had to delete.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Besides all the techie stuff, there are wonderful interactions between the people.<br />See the constant friction between the sheriff and his teen-age daughter. Sometimes very touching.<br />Eureka is a win in my book!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|For some reason I got two of these and no one will respond to be to have one returned. Here's hoping.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show is thrilling, suspense and a mystery. I love a good mystery. This show keeps me coming back for more!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Grew up with this movie and the disk got lost so I'm getting a new one. It's Indiana Jones mixed with the Little Rascals.
B006L1TT8G|5.0|My daughter loves that CD... She's even made me listen to a few songs... As long as she's happy I'm very happy.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This App is easy to navigate. Makes it fast and easy to check on my FB account. Jude it in both of my Kindles.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I wish there was more features. I want to restart mg city. Not an option. Also it was very confusing at first. A tutorial might be helpful.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun game to kill some time. My 10 year old loves it. Not full of killing and Gore. Easy to play.
0375842209|5.0|I read this book years ago and loved it so much that I recently purchased a copy for my 12 year old grand daughter. She began reading it immediately.<br /><br />For a book that is written by &#34;death&#34; it is not at all morbid and it really works well. The storyline is well done and can be educational for young adult readers, even though they will be caught up in the story. Definitely recommended.
B000HL09MG|5.0|Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time and eyes wide shut is one of the best examples of it. Everything in the movie is great and tells a great story. It is very strange yes but if you have a taste for Kubrick movies you will love this as well.
B0097K21YW|5.0|I played through this game twice last year, and loaded it up again last week when Amazon had it as FAOTD. I was hoping for more levels, but ... gah! Nope.<br /><br />Anyway ... it's totally worth a 5-star review. You get to spew fireballs at buildings & airplanes. How is that not awesome? Plan your shots to bounce off walls, squeeze through gaps, or just blast head-on with your target. Some boards require precise timing, but most just let you sit there and make a wonderful messy disaster.<br /><br />Alas ... more levels would be REALLY nice.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|nothing wrong with the product everything as it should be. The special features are decent, but I know most of the people buy a movie to watch the movie not the special features. I'll say that it is a great movie and it is very true to the musical, which I love. They are also effective in making the musical a movie. The music is still there but they do a pretty good job with visuals using modern technology to enhance the movie. My one issue with it is that the singing at times is alittle week and could be alot better. While I understand where he is coming from when he directs this way. The sacrificing musical beauty for acting moves is alittle to much. In Music you can show emotion in singing and show how you are about to make a big change or your life is over etc. without sacrificing the beauty. The musical does this amazingly but in the movie they sacrifice that music for acting moves which I'm not a big fan of. Other then this it is a very great movie.
1609611543|5.0|And we thought wheat was a great thing to have in our diet, wrong. This book opens eyes and minds with facts too important to ignore.
B000HZD168|4.0|Now this movie makes more sense after watching the new Star Trek movie Enter The Darkness . If you haven't seen both yet then you're missing out .
B0041KBWM0|2.0|Watch the 1996 Douglas McGrath version of Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow instead.  This version has no soul.  Garai is not Emma - she doesn't come across as a woman of the era or as a vivacious and romantic matchmaker who would attract Mr. Knightly - the essence of the story.  There are credible performances by other actors but none match favorably with their counterparts in the McGrath version.  Skip it.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Howard Shore at his most creative. He has taken themes and motifs from The Lord of the Rings and interwoven them with new themes and magically made us hear these themes as they must have existed in Middle-earth before the stories of Lord of the Rings were made into film. I have wearied my friends with recommendations for them to buy this and listen. But in the end, they agree that it is indeed spectacular.
B00BNXOMHA|4.0|5 stars for the product itself, -1 star for the ridiculous Amazon price tag!<br /><br />This product is a Best Buy exclusive. DON'T BUY IT HERE, you are being ripped off!!! This is $49.99 at Best Buy. Other reviewers have stated that this was a limited time offer and it is completely sold out and this set will not be restocked. This is incorrect! The Best Buy website (last I looked) said item was on back order. I went to the local Best Buy store (in May 2013) and they had a ton of them.<br /><br />This is a great deal (for $49.99 at Best Buy) if you don't care about marketing fluff, fancy packaging, and all the extras. You get 5 movies on 5 disks all in one double-thick Blu-ray case. These are not director's cuts. There are no bonus disks of special features. If all you want is the collection of 5 movies in one compact case this is the one to get.<br /><br />***I don't use the digital copies, so I have no comment on them.
B003VANOFY|3.0|The sound and build quality are fantastic with this headset.  I get the feeling they would last a long time.  These would probably get a 4.5 (the sound is fantastic!) but i have to give them a 3 because they DO NOT FIT MY HEAD.  I dont have a small head, in fact my head would probably be considered larger.  But for whatever reason they do not stay on my skull. I hover around the 2-3 setting (anything tighter and it becomes uncomfortable quickly) on both ears (they go up to 16) and they kinda stay on as long as I dont look down or move around to much.  Which would be great if I used them just to stare at a monitor but I like to do things around the house with them on (clean, light work-out, etc.) .  And not to mention I'm getting an Oculus Rift in the near future so the headphones I have have to both fit snuggly and comfortably.  I am now in the process of returning them which is a shame, I really did love the sound from them.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is written well and very entertaining. I didn't like the way that the trilogy ended but the book itself was good read.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|its ok. ok. alright. not the worst. Some of it was pretty good. It had its moments. It was ok.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I didn't read Hunger Games but watched the motion picture and was intrigued with the story line. Catching Fire is a great read. Well written and offers just the right amount of imagery to excite the readers throughout the entire book. I am super excited to view the upcoming movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great book. It does get heavy at times but in the end it is so worth it.  There is a good love story in here but its not the focal point either.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the story lines and the costumes. Also the scenery is very realistic. The characters show caring and some show selfishness just like in real life.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Many have probably had a relative or friend who has told of &#34;seeing the light&#34; when a near-death experience occurred. But this writer was a skeptic and a very highly trained neurosurgeon who understood brain function in its entirity.  This is similar to a trusted friend/financial advisor giving you inside information.  You have to take it seriously.<br /><br />We probably all hope that there is something after we die.  Some look to religion, some look to nature.  This writer is convinced that there is an afterlife, as he has been there and seen it personally.  He takes a lot of time to explain why his experience cannot be attributed to brain function or malfunction. He truly became convinced that there is something good waiting for us after we die.<br /><br />The book is easy to read in some parts and quite technical in other parts.  I have a medical background so I understood most of it but some parts were well beyond my understanding.  Also, while he mentions his religious background, he makes his arguments on non-religious basis.<br /><br />It is a good read and provides a lot of hope to his fellow humans.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is beautifully designed, it reminded me of Must which I loved. If you like puzzle games and solving problems this game will entertain you for a few hours. Can't wait for the next game from Fireproof!
B00874T02K|5.0|this app assumes that you'd already know the correct way to do push ups, sit ups, dips etc. so as long as you do know how to do them, this app is perfect for getting you up to that goal that you wish you could reach. what the app doesn't tell you, is how to stagger your workouts so that you can do all of the different exercises together. since each time you do a workout you go to exhaustion, it can be a little difficult. once you get the hang of it though, it's fantastic.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my 5, 7,  and 10 year olds love this app.  It is great for developing critical thinking and problem solving!
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I just finished reading Jane Austen's Emma for a class and watching this mini-series reminded me why I enjoyed the book so much. Truly captures the humor and the subtext of the book. A faithful and well-done adaptation.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was expecting a gooey love story when my wife said she wanted to see it... but it was a decent show.
B009K0P10K|3.0|Still an entertaining show to watch. It's gotten a bit far fetched with the initiative plot. There were a few characters that the show could've done without, like Ashley and Padma.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play it every time I have a few minutes to kill. But I warn you, it may be addictive!!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|A classic Sci-Fi film with great special effects for the mid 50's that hold up very well today.  I love the slow pan as the saucer approaches above the (quite realistic) glowing atmosphere of the planet.  You can see how some of the shots influenced Stanley Kubrik in 2001 and the producers of the Star Trek TV series.  I also enjoyed all of the extras included with the DVD, deleted scenes,<br />variations etc.  It's a must have for your Sci-Fi collection
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great show, and I&#34;ll be a fan till it ends! I recomend it to everyone who love's the English!
B000FC11JW|4.0|Likes: makes you think a lot about the knowledge worker & how to become an effective executive. Also very practical & very useful for daily life.<br /><br />Dislikes: it gets a little confusing & sometimes hard to understand what Peter Drucker is trying to communicate.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all high-school & college graduates who are entering the job force.<br /><br />The reason why I gave the book 4 out of 5 is that it has some really nice ideas & it definitely makes you think about the implications of being a knowledge worker, but at the same time is hard to understand some of the ideas the author tries to communicate through his writing.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! Bradley Cooper is sooo amazing in it. Totally recommend it. Jennifer Lawrence is hilarious. I love her character. Just an amazing movie.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great to fill the time and entertain kids and adults alike. Another great hit! I loved the little pudding guys... so cute! But they look more like jello :)
B000JML90Y|4.0|It's the Origin of Species. I think people who have an opinion on natural selection are at a true loss if they haven't read this book before speaking. P.S. It's a bit ridiculous to critique the value of read a classic piece of work. Read it. The download is free.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I liked this book because it was exactly what I needed at the time; a good, light read. characters had challenges and met them on their own terms in their own time. worked through them. especially endearing was a married couple of some years who led a very simple, good life together and were hopelessly devoted to each other. and this same couple were dear and best friends to the &#34;misremembered man&#34;.<br />a sweet book.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I am an animal lover and I love it and I know that all animal lover's will love this game&lt;3&lt;3
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great it gives you tons if options to do things and you can also play with your friends too!!!whoever made this game great job and congratulations because like everyone at school love$ it<br /><br />THANK YOU<br />FROM SUBWAY SURFER LOVER(: (;
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I really loved this book - I could not put it down - I read it from cover to cover in one sitting!
B008Q0CO0U|2.0|I watched based on Mark Wahlberg starring in it.  Even thought the title was concerning, I had high hopes.  The movie was terrible....
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I love this show, I love everything about zombies. This season in particular was a little slow in the beginning but it picks up with a great ending.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|this is a really fantastic movie with wonder dialog.  I recommend the movie highly, regardless of your interest in history.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show! Best show in years! I don't normally watch a lot of tv but a friend suggested I watch this show, I was going to be out for a week for surgery so I downloaded season 1... I now own all 3 seasons and watch then over and over, always catching things I didn't see the first time. If I could give it 10 stars I would!
B000I9X50U|5.0|When I saw that Adam Sandler was in it, I wasn't sure this was a movie that I would enjoy. After watching it, though, I was really surprised. The story was good with some really good messages and thought provoking elements.
B000TDGGRY|3.0|A decent series.  The use of different sciences in each novel keeps me interested and I usually learn something new.  Sometimes a little slow and sometimes characters aren't fully developed, but a good beach read.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|You get so few stories that are worth pondering...more than just a quick read. This world and protagonist sucks you in.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|I own two of these bad boys and run them in SLI with a i7-2600k. Almost every game I've tried, I've been able to max out settings on my 24\\" monitor at 1920x1200. The heatsink / fan setup on this card is far superior to any of the stock or near stock cooling systems on other brands. I don't see my cards going over 55 C when playing Planetside 2 or Battlefield 3. And although they aren't completely silent, they are far quieter than my old GTX 480 or even older HD 5850.<br /><br />I recommend this card to EVERYONE! Seriously, I think my friends and family are getting annoyed at me for it.<br /><br />My only grip with the card would be that it stands 1/2 inch or so taller than other cards because of the cooling pipes. If it was shorter, I would love to put one of these things in my home theater PC but my HTPC chassis isn't tall enough. If you don't have 1-2 inches of depth to spare in your chassis, this may not work for you.
B001KZG99A|5.0|It still had the brand new movie smell to it. The discs work and it never was opened. I would buy from here again.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|I heard this was a good movie, but I wasn't sure what to expect.  This was a great kids movie with plenty of entertainment for adults too.  I might even be buying it, rather than the one time rental, depending on whether or not my kids are still into it when the rental expires.
0920668364|5.0|I had this book years ago, but somehow misplaced it.  I was thrilled to find the book on line.  It arrived in mint condition!  Now. I am even more sentimental about sharing this story with my grandchildren.
B00AG297GK|4.0|Funny in a sick way. Twisted in a good way.Love story with balls. Might even watch this again.  Very irrelevant.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Not a bad game but could do with more hints and more of a walkthrough but considering its free can't complain too much
B002UD56I6|2.0|Saddly the subtittles are not in Spanish, so I should by another one, but still searching for it, because no description is detailed .
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is an great suspenseful book with many thrilling twists and I would recommend it to everyone . I  think that if anyone is not to like this book I would definitely ask why.in
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|Predictable rom com plot, but sheds light on Parkinson's disease and it's possibilities for living with it, not just surviving it. Anne Hathaway's character is free spirited and appropriately vulnerable.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|More.... Give me more.  I am waiting for book 3 and the suspense is heartbreaking.  I want to know the ending.  This is a series worth reading a few times.
B009R8DJ72|4.0|Pretty cool book but the last page is the cover from Diary of a Wimpy Kid 6, steel a great book
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This movie gets only 3 stars because it had funny moments, but it just seemed to drag on and on a bit too long.  The ending was also a bit disappointing.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I was pretty satisfied with it for awhile.  Then...I got Mahjong II.  I really like and recommend it over the original.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I felt like this was written quickly and is certainly not up to Archer's standards. The first half was a rehash of books I and II, and the second half storyline was very predictable. I hope book IV is better - I feel cheated!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After hearing all the talk about this book, I had to pick it up. I'm so sad I have finished fifty shades, as a mother and wife I love my smutt lol looking forward to the next two!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great app i love it! it is sooooooo fun and very graphic i recommend this to horse lovers every where
B0055SWM08|5.0|The deeper you get into this game the more difficult it becomes with a simplicity that lulls you into complacency that can bite you
B005PK56TA|3.0|Meh.<br /><br />Although I have to say Jessica Lange still has charisma.  She grabs your attention whenever she's on camera.  I started to lose interest at the end, but stayed with it just to see how they wrap everything up.  There were too many strands left unresolved for me.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|I missed much of this band the first time around. The sometimes overwrought lyrics aside, these guys were among the absolute best of the 80s and this set proves it.
B002ELIXCA|4.0|Dexter is a great series and I started out with the first few episodes thanks to an Amazon gift card I had. However, the Amazon video player still needs some work and it prevented me from watching some videos at times. I wish there were better options for offline viewing besides a Kindle or taking up space on my iphone, but I have no complaints about the series itself.
0399165274|4.0|I will start right out by saying I am a fan of Frederick Forsyth, and have been ever since Day of the Jackal.<br /><br />This is the story of a JSOC (Joint Special Operations Command) agent known as the Tracker hunting down a radical Islamic known as the Preacher.  The well written story takes the reader on a thrill ride through the web the Tracker must penetrate to find the Preacher.<br /><br />As with all Forsyth books, the author has meticulously done his research for this book - whether it is the military structure, the cutting edge technology available, or the weapons carried - this book rings true.<br /><br />If you are looking for one of the novels with pages dripping with bloody shootouts on every third page - this is not your kind of book.  This is a book for a thinking individual who can appreciate a well told tale.<br /><br />I do think the author overreached a bit, when he has the Tracker's father fall random victim to one of the Preacher's converts - the odds on that occurring are just way too small, that it sends up red flags in the mind of the reader.<br /><br />I was in the middle of reading a WEB Griffin book when this novel arrived by mail.  I did not even hesitate, I put down the Griffin book and eagerly started in on this latest by Forsyth - I was glad I did.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|It's a little heavy handed in the the plot line. I can see what's coming. It gets better so keep watching.
B00CSWA1PM|5.0|I LOVED the musical and now I can relive it through the CD!  Very catchy and spirited music -what else would you expect from Cyndi Lauper- and extremely talented cast! I'm looking forward to the Tonys to see how many awards they win! Do yourself a favor and buy the music! It will &#34;raise you up&#34;!!!
B003ASLJK4|4.0|My wife loves this movie!!  It is a true love story that has enough twists to make it very interesting.  The story will stay in your mind for days!
B008D47DXC|5.0|Have seen it before.Wanted to own it so I could any time I wanted.It was good then and still is
B008CJ0KJ2|2.0|I just don't understand...is it so difficult to ensure some product quality in pressing vinyl? It's a spectacular record, beautiful...but the saving grace for the edition, is the CD edition included with the vinyl edition, 'for free.' Two stars for pulling yet another warped vinyl from a freshly opened package.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|Not sure how it received best picture.For me something was missing just not sure what that was.I would not care see it again
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Suspenseful. It was a love story and thriller. Even my boyfriend enjoyed watching it. Watched it a few times. Would totally watch again.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Not the best action movie I have ever seen but it was good. Didn't have that much of a story line
B000T46O52|5.0|This is a great film, even if it is pretty old. It gives insight not only into the intricacies of the court proceedings, but also real relationships and reactions.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Have seen many good movies with Mark Wahlberg this movie was not one of them.several good actors for a movie just didn't work.
030746363X|4.0|Followed the diet, lost the weight. Sorry...<br />I also did the workout plan (I am a life-long workout guy) and kept strength and muscle mass (as measure by Bod Pod while dieting.<br />The book is worth the money just for elucidation of the Minimum Effective Dose MED) principle. If you don't buy in to that, you are doomed from the first.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|It was a phenomenally scary movie with lots of edge of your seat scenes.  Top of the line on the ratings scale.  I loved it.  Kathleen M. Sekanina, Chardon, OH
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Watching without ads is a pleasure. The delivery was crisp and clean. This show just gets better and better! We can't wait to see what the gang is up to next season!
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|with the movie...and good in the car while driving...especially of you are needing something to steady yourself as you are determined to drive on through to destination and rest afterward....
B00AVIMB1W|3.0|It was interesting, sideline notes about his personal ordeal with the government, his religious connections to the black muslims and some other aspects outside the ring.  I was disappointed in the amount of time spent in bed instead of the ring.  So many great fights could have been highlighted.  Will Smith of course was excellent.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It gets 2 stars rather than one or none because the first half of the book is entertaining.  Then it gets sily
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Finely honed, sharp writing  and it captivated my interest  throughout. But the ending lacked some credibility because I have serious doubts about the murderer having the actual physical strenghth to carry out some of these acts; there should have been at least a hint  of this  capability in there somewhere.  As in Gone Girl, Flynn is a master at building suspense with subject matter that deals with the darkest, flawed side of human nature.  Her major female characters are interesting and well drawn for the most part but I didn't feel the same connection with her male characters.  On the whole, a good read with a chilling suspense that keeps one turning the pages.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is fun & challenging! Even when you've advanced your vehicles to their maximum, the next challenge is to see how far you can advance in each stage. Just when you think your about to beat your our distance, BAM!, you didn't make it.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|If you enjoyed the first Silent Hill, I strongly advise against watching this one. It is truly a sad attempt at a sequel.
B00BNR6RH4|5.0|At the time of The Beatles break up, I was confused about what happened and why.  Did Yoko cause it?  Was it Paul's egotism that came between Lennon/McCartney, possibly the greatest songwriting team in history?  Had John done a drop out from the musical scene?  All I was sure of at the time was that Paul was putting out music, some of which, in my opinion, rivaled what The Beatles had done.  And he had formed a new band.  \\"Wings\\".  The name had deep meaning and imagery and I thought was very apropos.  I think they would have been just as good without Linda (maybe better depending on who took her place), but if Paul loved her much and it made him happy to have her there with him, so be it.  I got tickets to the show at the Capital Center in Largo Maryland (near Washington, D. C.) as soon as they went on sale.  At that time concerts were general admission so getting a better seat wasn't a factor, I just wanted a ticket before they sold out (which they did, almost immediately).  When the band hit the stage, electricity flowed through the crowd, magic happened and time became immaterial.  The band was tight and you could see how comfortable they were with each other.  Paul was undoubtedly the star, but he didn't take any luster away from any of the others and they all shone in their own right.  He resurrected The Beatles with some of their early work like \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\", through the later material like \\"Lady Madonna\\" and \\"The Long And Winding Road\\".  When he performed \\"Yesterday\\" the audience was in the palm of his hand and the contrast between the absolute silence while he performed to the deafening roar of the ovation he received when he finished was stunning.  The band's performance alone was great and didn't require any embellishments, but \\"Live And Let Die\\" was a knockout.  Lasers and pyrotechnics were fairly new at that time and expensive enough that most bands couldn't afford them.  But I'm pretty sure Wings had some financial backing that they could draw from.  When the stage exploded and the air lit up with laser light just after the words \\"live and let die!\\", the audience went wild.  Wings took me through a roller coaster ride of emotions and feelings that night.  Each song on these albums is performed well by a band that is very tight and plays together like they've been doing it for a very long time.  This is one of the best live albums on the market today, which is quite an achievement.  I have attended many concerts in my life and this recording not only faithfully reproduces the music, but this mix allows me to put on my headphones, close my eyes and experience a lot of the original feelings from perhaps the best concert I have ever been to.  It may have even been better than a Springsteen show.  Maybe.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|This is a charming story, and the characters very recognisable - I know people just like the main<br />characters.  I found it strange that the story stayed with me long after I had finished the book
B000QRIGLC|4.0|this one was recommended by amazon.<br />I really enjoyed the story it was a great read.<br />I highly recommend it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The author seems to understand very well how men and women think.  The many twists and turns of<br />the plot make this book addictive - one just cannot wait to find out what's next<br />I was a teeny bit disappointed with the ending, but a Five Star book it definitely is
B000M5AJQ8|4.0|ended up getting it on Blue Ray when the HD DVD format died.<br />Great Scorcese movie and a stellar cast
0425252868|5.0|This is a true and inspiring story. A Luftwaffe war ace, one victory shy of a high military decoration, finds an easy prey: a lone American bomber, far apart from the protection of its squadron. On closer inspection, the enemy plane should not be flying, as it has sustained incredible amounts of damage; the tail gunner is dead, the rest of the crew barely hanging by a thread... The German chooses not to kill such a helpless adversary, and actually helps him to cross the gauntlet of flak batteries. The whole story becomes a secret, on one hand keeping a man from the firing squad, on the other by censure. Yet the common bond among men of conscience will find them looking for one another, decades after the war. This is such a powerful story that I finished reading it one night, around 3 A.M.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I really enjoy his voice and arrangements.<br />Heaven off this album is in heavy rotation in the car.<br />Love his sound.
B00336G7HI|5.0|Battery has been performing well, have been using it for multiple occasions and it holds the same charge as the included battery for the camcorder.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|This plot and all action.<br />What more can you ask for?<br />Bought it as soon as it was available to buy.
0312330537|5.0|When I first started reading this book, it seemed a daunting task. Not only was it a genre I have little experience with, but it was also a very voluminous book, even if it only has 900 pages. As it was, I started reading. The intro to me was a bit slow, but once the first 100 pages or so went by, I could hardly set the book down. His descriptions are colourful, without being so long as to draw away from the story, and he embellishes key points, to extend the experience, without being too unrealistic. About 2/3 of the way through, the pace of the book changed rather dramatically, which wasn't something I cared for. I normally read high fantasy books, but for anyone, even if this book doesn't fall into your normal genre, I recommend you read it. you will not be disappointed.
B0015XHP4K|4.0|Nothing can be said that hasn't been already said.<br />I like action movie and growing up in the 80's Rambo is an iconic character.<br />a must own for any Stallone fan
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|My science background is minimal, so I really appreciated the way Dr. Lipton summarized biology and related concepts, summarized new cellular research, and then analyzed the meaning of this work.    More than a year after reading this book, I cannot stop thinking about it. I recommended it to nearly everyone I met during the time I read it, so compelling was the arguments it made.    I agree with the reviewer who observed that the book is strong on biology but weak on exposing how one is to \\"unleash\\" the power of the mind.    The work does offer good explanations for the processes through which stress and belief can produce physiological outcomes.    Highly recommend.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Read it based on my GF recommendation.<br />I get it but didn't get it.  I am not the demographic for this one.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I'd read it again! I love being able to get the book I want with the ease of a click
B004A8ZX2I|3.0|Bought this one without having seen it in theaters.<br />it was good for a viewing.<br />not one that I will revisit over and over.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|the best game ever and its free.. i love this when i have nothing else to do with my time. buy this game if u love to have fun. so yeah buy this game for the heck of it
B003TNM2K6|4.0|Good movie and great cast.<br />And one of the most messed up endings in movie history.<br />Well worth a watch.
B007Z9RS22|5.0|I gotta say that it is a good movie. I've watched it for a hundred times. And I cry every time I watch it. Just love it.
B00CDV6WDS|2.0|I play making all the time and this one is dull. It is hard to see what tiles are available for play, there is not enough contrast. There are lots of games to play but I look at it for maybe one game a day. Don't buy it.
B009ME47H2|5.0|This product has made my life easier and sweet.  I can talk more than usual so I am able to express myself better.<br />It is a win-win every time I speak.  It is just a sweet thing to have.  I will never move without it .
B00847KFDS|4.0|I must say, I gave more thought to this purchase than ANY other Fogerty/CCR album I've ever bought, probably combined. It wasn't exactly for lack of faith in JF--he's been remarkably consistent over the years, IMO, and I thoroughly enjoy even his \\"lesser\\" efforts--but, rather, out of my innate suspicion of \\"duets\\" albums. I long ago lost count of the number of these efforts I bought with enthusiasm and quickly sold in disgust.<br /><br />But \\"Wrote a Song\\" is not your typical duets album. I feared it might be your garden-variety, note-for-note, dial-it-in effort that is so common with this kind of project. I should've known better. Fogerty is way too talented, way too driven, and cares way too much about his legacy to let that happen. The arrangements are fresh and just different enough from the originals to keep things interesting, even if they aren't necessarily improvements. At least they aren't hugely worse, which so often happens in these types of cases.<br /><br />The two originals, especially \\"Mystic Highway,\\" are fabulous, and indicate that our hero is FAR from running out of gas.<br /><br />Others have done a good job of evaluating the individual songs, so I won't. But, as of this writing, my favorite is probably \\"Mystic Highway.\\" IMO it's one of the most memorable songs Fogerty has done in years. In a different time, with enthusiastic promotion, it would've likely been a huge smash. It's THAT good. At best, in this day and age, it might hit the lower reaches of the charts, which to me is a crying shame. It deserves a much better fate.<br /><br /> \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone\\" is decidedly NOT for everyone. It's not the place to start if you're curious about John Fogerty's music (either CCR or solo), but it is an interesting little diversion that turned out far better than I would've expected. He chose most of his partners wisely, and the production and arrangements are pretty neat. Yes, most of us would've probably preferred to have seen an album of all-original material (\\"Mystic Highway\\" augers very well for his next effort, though), but in the meantime, \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone\\" represents an interesting little creative waystation on that road. Recommended.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|watched it with our grand-daughters , 9 & 10.  They were a little antsy until the ship sinking. Not sure what they got out of it though.<br /><br />Wife and I liked it very much.
1439196834|4.0|if you are a fan of HIMYM and esp a Barney fan, you will love it.  this book is legendary!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I would recommend this book to fantasy book lovers. The photos are creepy but the story isn't creepy or scary. The creepiest photo in my opinion is the one with one  girl looking at her reflection in the water and sees two girls but she wasn't even a character in the book. The photos look ok not great on the kindle but the hand written letters are hard to read. The story doesn't end so don't expect a resolution. I think the movie should be fun though.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Everyone I talked to that saw this movie in the theater seemed disappointed, so I avoided this film initially. However, I enjoyed watching it (maybe because my expectations were low). This is a nice, feel good story with an enjoyable cast - a good way to kill a couple hours without having to be too engaged.
B00BF11STU|4.0|IT WAS JUST OK  I HEARD ALOT ABOUT IT IM GLAD I DIDN'T PAY TO SEE IT IN THE THEATER
B001XV3LSS|4.0|Good acting and I liked the message of perseverance and enduring hardship and persecution to see your goals and beliefs through.  It showed that more is seen through paying attention and listening; that blindness does not have to handicap a person who trains them-self to strengthen their abilities that they have.
B00000DFSK|5.0|Outstanding, some of U2's best work. I think all U2 fans should invest on this CD. You will see the advancement of their playing through the years.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|i bought this on blu-ray thinking it came with the DVDs as well (as most blu-rays) but it does not.  so i ended up buying a blu-ray player to play these on.  i'm extremely pleased with the movies however.  how can you not be?
B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoy playing the game. I do have a concern about the pop-up ads. I can not exit out of them. I have to exit out the game and return to it. I hope I don't have to delete the app. I would give a higher rating if I was not concerned about the ads.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is one of my favorites. Everybody should read this book. This is a real good book. I love this book.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Great to see this movie in blue ray. I remember when I first saw the Sound of Music in 1965 on the drive in movie screen. Color and sound are great and vibrant. Recommend to children of all ages.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book lacks a lot of substance. However, as in all of the previous books in series, I could not put it down. Fast, easy read.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I am quite happy with my purchase. After considering spending almost $300 on a gaming headset before deciding on these, I think I made the right choice.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I wanted to know what all the fuss was.  It's a great period drama with interesting twists.  A good decent show.
B00BZIP31M|5.0|With their new album Battle Beast continues what they started with the superb debut cd \\"Steel\\" -> establishing themself as a major player among today`s classic Heavy Metal bands.<br />For everyone that likes Judas Priest, Iron Maiden etc.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I always look forward to reading a Jeffrey Archer novel because I know it will enthrall and engage me. I usually find them hard to put down. This book didn't have enough substance to it. Since I read it on my kindle, I was quite surprised when it ended. I was expecting more.
B009NY43NY|4.0|After all this bs she ends up with Sam??? Ha! Okay very disappointed but at the same time old how else Harris's could of ended the series..  I wish she ended up with Eric though and had at least one for real shot with alcide lol
B00APUQKDG|1.0|There was nothing exciting or entertaining about this movie. I found myself getting bored and skipping throughout the movie, hoping it would get better but it didn't. The whole movie is talking taking place in a limo the ENTIRE time. That's it. Wouldn't recommend.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|When I first played it I was going to rate it 2 or 3 stars. I played it once and wasn't really interested in really learning how to play.  But then I got bored and really gave it a shot and I got hooked!  This is unlike any match three + game because you have to focus on two parts of the game. The top screen to see what monsters you encounter and the bottom to match wands and swords to kill them. There are keys to unlock treasure chests, shields for defence, wood, stone and gold for upgrading.  You also have potions that give bonuses and scrolls, food, axes, etc awarded as you match certain combos that help. you kill the bad guys. I finished the entire game till there were no more objectives or upgrades.  It took two days of hardcore playing. There were no glitches on my kindle fire, and there are no in game purchases. This game is classic, and though I got it for free, now that I know just how good it is, I'd have paid. Well done 88 games.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Plasma Sky - Rad Space Shooter has Great visuals, responsive controls and a lot of levels.....what else you need? it's a classic reinvented.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|Lovely app that I use daily. Like every day. Only spinning numbers like the timer has would make it better.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Adds are annoying!  Other than that my bedtime relaxation. Win one out of three games most of the time. Lets play cards.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Real good book that moved quickly.  I was a tad disappointed with the ending but not enough to not recommend.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|They is a great little game. It works very well and I have had  no problems with it whatsoever. Perfect for the price
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Really have fun with this game. Good job .don't mind kids playing this game at all. Really want to see the movie also.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I usually love any movie Tom Hanks is in. This one was not what I expected. It's a long drawn out story that could have been told in the first five minutes. I found my mind wandering at time because of boredom and about 45 minutes in...I just wanted it to be OVER already.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|First, I admit I never liked any of the Oz stories.<br />This full-length book promised to shelve the old classic and provide in its place a modern version of The Wizard of Oz, designed for today's modern reader.<br />I think the revised version kept that promise. It's never easy to re-tell a story and keep the essence without changing the fabric of the story itself.<br />So, even though I still do not like stories of Oz, I compliment this accomplishment.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Any time I need to edit a document or view one on my phone, I use this without a problem. I have used on a droid x and Galaxy II Note.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|After reading this vivid story, I became particularly interested in this series. Rick Riordan has done it again. He combines mythology with daily life------- he understands kids and tells the story from the teens' views as an average kid would put the story. Although the fantasies can be a bit sidetracking, the author transitions smoothly. This is a great book!
B00124LYHQ|4.0|Took my daughter to a little theater production and everyone couldn&#34;t stop comparing it to the movie.  Hadn't seen it in many years so I got this to show my daughter.  Brando at his best, Vivien Leigh so vulnerable.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|It's awful. Lame story line, terrible script. I love both Streisland and Rogen and ignored the lukewarm reviews to watch. BIG MISTAKE.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Very enjoyable story.  Bought the second in the series right after finihsing this.  Sanderson's style is very enjoyable and his completion of the Wheel Of Time series was excellent.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was an interesting and challenging game.  The puzzles were an appropriate difficulty.  A little scary for my 10 yr old, good for adults.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I love this series! I cannot wait for season four to become free for prime customers. Watch the first show of season one and you won't be able to stop.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 4 year old daughter just loves it a lot.<br />its simple because only swipe gestures are used to control the surfer.
B009JZTP4Y|5.0|A must for any Star Trek Fan.  Great by even todays standards. Will watch over and over never gets old
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is hard to put down and it has quite a few levels to keep it exciting and new.
B006Y5EDRG|2.0|Enjoyed the song and dance numbers a lot. That's about it! None of the characters are very like-able, in my opinion. The show is pretty predictable.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|This is a very great album, I got this along with other. High Voltage is by far the best song on this album, however I have had his for only a few days.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think this is one of my favorite book on earth<br /><br />I love this book because Suzane explains things so you can imagine it. I can't wait to read the second and third book.<br /><br />I just wish this book would go on forever just as interesting  so I wouldn't have to find another book.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I enjoyed the novel, the back and forth with mother and son..though I felt that there was not a lot of thought put into the ending.  The book needed a clearer resolution to the relationships that were developing.  I think we also needed to see how he and his mother ended up adjusting to outside life.
B004TL3R24|5.0|The strap is a simple design that works really well. It is easy to use and can be stored by placing the strap around the neck of the tripod. It makes carrying my tripod much easier.
B00AAZOKS8|3.0|I think we may have read this one once... Not a bad book, really, just not that interesting to my son.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|In my opinion this movie has a few flaws.  If you would like to know<br />  the true story of Micky Cohan, chick his biography on Mobsters.<br />  Micky Cohan was subordinate  to Bugsy  while Bugsy was  in Los Angeles. He<br />  was very short not shown in the movie. Micky went twice to prison but not<br />  on Murder Chaarges but Income Tax Evasion. He was hit in the head with a<br />  iron pipe not by Mafia sanctioned hit  but by a crazy inmate.<br />  As for the technal side. The audio is bad not in a technal cause but by the<br />  the Actors whispering or sluriing the words. There are lots of machine gune<br />  scenes where the viewer has problems in knowing  who is killing who.and why.<br />  Finally, this is no Casino and could never compare.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I got this book in paperback form for my baby shower from my husband and I've been reading it to my son since (he's 3 now). I love the snuggle time I get from him when I sing the little song. The message in the book is wonderful for a mother and a son and perfect to keep that long standing tradition of love going. This one is an oldie and a classic!
030746363X|2.0|Too long and unattractive! You will lose interest simply because it's not very well written. Sometimes the information is contradictory and sometimes it becomes really confusing. Waste of money!
B0094K1K42|4.0|I liked the movie, the story was amusing, the characters were good, and Charlize was great as the self absorbed main character.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|The first hour or so of the movie seemed great, it was hilarious.  After that, it seemed to get a little long and dragged out.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This movie was unbelievably gory....I felt physically ill.  Had to look away many times, but overall good story.  There is one scene where the mother's shirt is ripped away...so if you have children watching with you, beware!  I would not let my children watch this as it is too bloody.  Don't believe they could handle the intensity.
B004P2HMNM|5.0|My Grandson and step-son enjoys this lego set and allows for parent interaction.  They want to collect more.<br />I think we will get another request for Christmas.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I don't understand why push notifications/ alerts don't work. I can get email push on kindle fire but not facebook. I have tried troubleshooting with Amazon spent hours on phone an they said they would have to call me back an they haven  yet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|infront of trians and be on train tracks but I gave it 5stars be cause it is fun and challenging that's the. hole purples of a game
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is well written by a neurosurgeon who was unexpectedly in a coma for 7 weeks, and was thought to be certain to die, or at best to be a vegetable if he survived.  And yet, he did survive and live to become a writer, speaker, and messenger with encouraging ideas and concepts for us all to consider.  Whatever your beliefs, this book will pull you in, and it will be hard to put it down.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|It was OK.  Good acting, but dragged a bit in some places.  Social issues agenda with a 21st century view seemed to get in the way.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Well now there are no longer any shows with space battles on TV - to bad a scifi channel had to change to a syfy channel and loose all hope of science - and only have fyction.....<br /><br />:P
B0063IH60K|4.0|All you have to do when the ad pops up is click on it and a bar pops up and you skip it.  That's it, your game is ready to play, I play at least 15 times a day with no problems.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second read was even better than the first time I read it.  The second read was more<br />understanding. I recommend it to anyone.
B0058SNIC6|4.0|These are what I consider the classic Croc.  Fits snug and works perfect for work.  I love them because you can just wipe them clean and be ready to go for work.  They are favorites.  I gave them a four because they do run small.  I am hesitant to go the next size up... and they aren't miserably small.  I wear them at least once a week. :)

They are challenging with a great result and gift when the project is completed.  I try to purchase them for every holiday.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept me turning the page, did not expect the twists and loved every one of them! Highly addictive!
B00005JKHN|5.0|I haven't watched this movie since i was a kid, and i got to watch it again with my son like it was the first time. Awesome, thank u
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Huge Castle fan and this season was one of the best.  Great twists and threads to keep you interested.  A must for any Castle fan.
B000065V42|5.0|My son is obsessed with this movie, as was I when i was a kid. Super excited we get to share that.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|A more complex movie than I had expected, and not a remake of &#34;Rocky&#34;. Consider it a story about men and the pressures they are under. We live near the filming location and it was great to recognize so many places and references to the suburbs south of Philadelphia.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|My son loves this movie. I think its very cute and fun to watch all year long. Thank you again
B001KZG99A|3.0|Yes indeed, when I was 14 I wanted to be a genius and rich, and invent a matter-antimatter power source that would allow me to power an anti-gravity machine so I could fly all over the world and fight evil. I also wanted a gorgeous and loyal girlfriend, but had little idea of exactly what I would do with her other than gaze longingly. Finally, my adolescent fantasy has been instantiated in this movie! The movie shows a profound understanding of the early teenage boy.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|My son and his father are obsessed with this movie. I think I have seen it over 100 times. Thanks
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|Was a great game until it decided to stop awarding me points when i was only 500K away.  Don't waste your time.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|In the midst of entertainment doldrums via cable TV, this movie was a most welcome find! Tommy Lee Jones is always a delight to watch, with his grizzled characterizations. This is an accomplished cast, even when the roles are barely more than cameos in length. The periodic dialogues with the specter of Texan General John B. Hood of Civil War era renown were fascinating. The very final seconds of the film brought his influence back once more with deeper meaning. Great flick!
B00005OWIU|5.0|I love the soundtrack from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone! It is so calming and relaxing. It was an Excellent purchase - I saved it to my computer at work so I can listen to it while I do paperwork; it's also great for driving when I'm particularly annoyed at other drivers.
B000O1799U|3.0|Nice smelling and goes on easy, can't really tell it's doing much more than say Gold Bond CoQ10 cream. But not a bad product either.

B005LAII80|4.0|There really is no reason for me to write this review as 1,100 have already chimed in. I'm doing so because of how surprised I was in seeing that, what I thought was going to be a mediocre, pedestrian outing, was actually very good.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is hitting the street with a rookie trainee (Olivia Thirlby) who didn't test well but is a mutant psychic which could giver her an advantage. Answering a call involving three dead lowlifes in a huge, vertical slum, they figure to dig deeper only to find it was a \\"message\\" execution. The attempt to find the perps leads them to a gang which is manufacturing and distributing a new drug called SLO-MO. The gang is headed up by a violent, scarred woman named Ma Ma (Lena Headey) and she isn't going down easy.<br /><br />The story and script are good (or at least good enough). What is really happening here excels on the production level. For my dollar, the director, Peter Travers has really stepped it up. The color palette is outstanding with many colors being over-saturated in greens and yellows giving everything a very diseased pallor. The sound design is also very good. The music score blends in with other sounds to raise the sense of doom and helplessness. The gore effects are outstanding. Seeing someone's head explode the way it's done here is one of a kind. The action scenes, in general, were filmed well. Travers knows how to set up and frame a shot. The editing, likewise, was essentially seamless. The set of the Slum was great. Part of what a film like this requires is the look, and they got it here in spades. The acting was good enough though I found it odd that Urban plays the entire movie without removing his helmet. Lena Headey is outstanding as Ma Ma. Her scarred face helps drive home her sense of resolve.<br /><br />This is not unlike the movie \\"The Raid\\" in its basic outline. This merely has a greater budget driving it toward a higher level. If you like sci-fi action, this is about as good as it gets.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are perfect for the lead roles in this show. Hands down the best version of the Sherlock Holmes story out there. Cannot wait for the next season.
B000JLO6OG|5.0|Now, I know a lot of you might be balking at the price of this umbrella adapter at first, but let me assure you, it's worth EVERY one of the hundreds of dollars I spent on this thing.  I mean, nothing screams amateur photog like showing up to a gig with a plastic umbrella adapter and plain old brass screw threads.  No sir.  They spared no expense on this baby.  The pure plutonite-molded core and 24 caret gold posts just scream, \\"PROFESSIONAL!\\"  And man... does it swivel!!  Sure, the soft gold deforms the first time you screw a strobe down, but you'll feel like a million bucks every time you adjust your lights in front of the sultan of Brunei.  In fact, I liked this product so much that I bought one for every one of my dozen lightstands.  And a couple of spares, too.  What's several thousand dollars for knowing you own the very best lighting gear that money can buy?<br /><br />Hell, I'll make you each a deal: I want to spread the word about these fantastic umbrella adapters so much, that I will personally offer to sell the ones from my own collection to you at a loss for a mere $500 each.

B001JNNDEW|4.0|Got this as a gift. It's a funny movie but it is now free on Netflix and maybe even Amazon Prime. Not sure it is worth buying.
B00CW665VI|5.0|NO SPOILERS!!!<br />I absolutely loved this book! Couldn't put down! Reading from Drew 's point of view was the best. Emma Chase 's take on man had me laughing, sad, angry, heartbroken, and feeling love for Drew. All the emotions that men elicit from woman. There was definitely depth to this story and I'm starting it again to get the full effect. Excellent job Emma!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The smile gets me every time! Great stories and a wonderful adventure. I love this show, cannot wait to start season 2.

B00000JCOV|4.0|This is a good first popular album,  although I read they had an album before this.  I like the fast paced songs on here especially &#34;Liberate.&#34;  This is a good album if you like angry songs.  I think they got even better with their next 2 albums..  The music on here is very &#34;raw&#34;..  I just wasn't crazy about a couple of the songs.  I also forgot this came out in 1999..  way back..
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I really enjoy this game.  I like that there are so many levels to complete.  My niece & nephew took over my kindle so they could play it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game that was the perfect balance of fun and mystery. The puzzles are challenging without being so difficult they are discouraging. I was sad I solved it  so quickly but that was my own fault. I was so wrapped up in it, once started I couldn't stop til I finished. The price is a bargain for how much I enjoyed it. I cannot wait for the next one.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Super easy to play, motivating challenges, loads of interesting information. The music and graphics are beautiful and pleasant. My son will be old enough to play it soon, but I'm enjoying it until he finds it!
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Im 14 and me and my dad love the game. Its a fun old style space shooter with some strategy, touch control and tilt control. I play it all the time and its definatly worth the price.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Can't stop playing ...it's a cool game .It keeps you coming back and checking on your city's .Your going to like it
B0055S348W|5.0|I got this when it was &#34;free app of the day&#34; on Amazon Appstore. I use it to print using Google Cloud Print. Works like a charm. Have tried it once with a network printer without going through Google Cloud Printing. Worked well for one HP printer I tried on.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Sinister tries to do for cardboard boxes what Psycho did for showers. This movie definitely unnerves. The cast is fantastic to a fault; Ethan Hawke and Juliet Rylance in particular act the hell out of a scene together later in the film as tensions are coming to a head. The movie is about a true crime writer (Hawke) who moves his family into a murder house so that he can get a better feel for the subjects of his latest book. At the house - which his family is not supposed to know is the actual murder house, which is one of a number of unlikely things he does in this movie - he finds a box of home movies. When he watches the home movies he realizes the mystery he is investigating is a lot weirder than he ever imagined. The idea behind what happened to the previous family is plenty disturbing enough to keep the viewer uncomfortable, and the research the lead character uncovers about a symbol discovered at the crime scene will keep you thinking about the film long after you shut out the lights to try to sleep. The soundtrack is a genius blend of sound effects and eery music, not quite one or the other, to keep you on edge. It's just that Ellison, the lead character, does things you'd think any halfway intelligent human being would have known better than to do. Like move his family into a murder house and think they wouldn't find out about it. Or something else he does later in the movie, which (minor spoilers) was telegraphed in such a way that the viewer did not need the deputy's timely intervention to see it coming. As a true crime writer, Ellison should have picked up on that connection and it would appear he didn't. These random acts of derp from the main character detract a bit from the overall enjoyment of the movie, but it's still well worth a watch if you like creepy films.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I used to use another app on my phone when I found this one. Love that it uses Google maps and is very easy to use.. would recommend this to everyone
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Mr. Gaiman allows the reader to BECOME Shadow (the protagonist) and plunge willingly into a world of folk-gods, demi-gods and assorted &#34;strange&#34; people. Hang on for a wild ride...I found it practically impossible to put down. When I'd finished, I immediately downloaded Neverwhere, and was even MORE delighted! Just a great , touching, blackly-humorous story with a perfect ending. Perhaps not for the squeamish.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a great game! This should get the neurons firing through the brain. Clever! Haven't been able to put it down.
B000FC130E|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a writer I'll never tire of, and I wanted this book as soon as I'd read American Gods. Profoundly amusing, touching, black-humored...and believable. I just love his (our) world of weirdness, which may just be the real truth of &#34;what's out there.&#34;
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Love playing the piano along with a guide or just having it play for you. Good songs were available to choose from.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Liked. Great series!! Enjoyed the drama and mystery that ensued through out the entire series!  Great characters! Recommend it to all!
0393342212|3.0|This book contains some very useful information regarding the competitive interactions between siblings.  Some of the set-ups are not real practical but do illustrate a point.  The little cartoons are particularly useful in demonstrating interactions.  I think the authors perhaps should have paid a bit more attention the the multitude of responses available in a given situation.  My three grandsons rarely have responded as described in the text.  Still working on getting the touch just right but at least a working thesis for positively modifying sibling interactions.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|.....that makes it almost impossible to stop playing! In a way,  I actually wish I hadn't ever downloaded this one. I've done little else since then. It's not a flashy game with super slick graphics,  and the overall goal couildn't be simpliler,  but the physics are great and the controls operate like clockwork,  there's just......something.
B00498YZH8|4.0|Very good acting but kind of a disappointing thriller.  The sequence of events was thrilling and a good plot but disapponting that she could never face her father; and there seems to be some kind of sympathy for the father, even as he is revealed as a low life dirt bag, who puts his house down as bail, all the while his kids are living there with no ohter place to go.

B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This was actually a great movie..A little like &#34;sleeping with the enemy&#34; and some others. Well at least similar plot lines, but all in all I really enjoyed it
B00821OX98|2.0|The drama is of a depressing sort. Giant rodent like aliens...so done with! Humans being seen as inferior intelligence....ugh!  Some cliche acting, depressing broken families looking for love ones and everyone carrying guns to fight the superior over grown cockroaches.  Really Hollywood?  Even the music is blah.  My husband watched it and I tried to get into it but had to make jokes and annoying comments throughout till I ended up painting our house as something better to do. ;)
B002ZG999U|3.0|Somehow I got suckered into buying two because I did not pay attention to the quantity count before placing the order. -Movie(s) and packaging itself are fine. -Just didn't like how it automatically Qty. (2)ed  the order.

B000002H1T|5.0|5 stars because the music is wonderful and timeless. There isn't a song on the CD that I don't love
B00821OX98|5.0|Great storyline, acting is  supurb, and once you get past a couple of the early scenes with the &#34;aliens&#34; it hooks you in to where you're dying to see what happens in the next episode. For a television series it's worth the time spend to watch it.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|The best toy in the world is made by Lego. I Recommend them to everyone from 5-99 with an imagination
B00BUT5I84|2.0|This album reminds me most of Linkin Park's \\"A Thousand Suns\\" - a ton of experimental sounds and textures, but a complete lack of interesting songwriting to allow you to appreciate the sonic creativity. I feel like Im listening to the score of a movie, and not an album. I've listened to it a few times now, and there are only 1 or 2 songs that jumped out at me. The rest just flowed into each other, with nothing really memorable happening.<br /><br />Bottom line, this album doesn't give me many reasons to want to listen to it again. Thats unfortunate too, because it just leaves more room for crappy bands like \\"Fun.\\" to take up the spotlight.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked the way this was written and the sincerity of the author. It certainly changes the way you think of the hereafter and helped me to realize that what we do here does make a difference.  Also that our loved ones aren't that far away.  I really appreciated this book.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|great game really fun but it needs more hints I would suggest buying this game. It needs more colors for the monsters
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I loved this book! It makes you appreciate and consider the love for life, family, and those who you care about.
B00BPWDMP2|3.0|Not overly impressed with this one. It's not horrible but not great compared to the rest of what Lady A has done!
158270208X|4.0|This book helps one to focus and be more grateful in life. We often take so many things or loved ones for granted and also God.  And knowing to be more thankful and/or grateful will help one to prosper better.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone that can get their little hands on it.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I like this game on FB so decided to get it for my kindle. It's O.K, but what on earth were they thinking with that awful game sound?  Why can't we have the original Diamond Dash game sound? Don't get and don't like it. Sorry.

B005HED11Y|5.0|It was great to see this again. Kirk, Mccoy and Spok were good and acted well. Good old social commentary.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Had to watch this for my son's class requirement. A great classic, enjoyed watching it again. Great for older kids to watch. It offers a clear dilemma, and teaches a lesson in the story. Something of which contemporary films don't usually offer.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I have this game on my iPod and I loved it so much I downloaded it on my kindle and instantly fell in love with it. Not a mistake to purchase.
B0090SI42Y|3.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />In my opinion The Man With The Iron Fists is kind of a mixed bag. It's easy to fall in love with because it's obviously supposed to be over-the-top and cheesy, but at the same time nothing really feels memorable. To be honest I don't think I've actually seen a kung-fu movie so this is probably my first, but upon doing some research apparently what we see in The Man With The Iron Fists is pretty standard as far as martial arts films go.<br /><br />The story is a little difficult to explain due to the fact that it lacks any sense of direction. Basically we start off with the leader of the Lion clan, Gold Lion, getting assassinated. This leaves his two subordinates, Silver Lion (Byron Mann) and Bronze Lion (Cung Le), to take his place as leaders of the clan. Gold Lion was a leader who believed in peace while Silver Lion has a lust for war. In an effort to eliminate all traces of Gold Lion, he sends assassins to eliminate Gold Lion's only son, Zen-Yi aka The X-Blade (Rick Yune).<br /><br />After word got out that Gold Lion was assassinated, a mysterious man by the name of Jack Knife (Russell Crowe) arrives at Jungle Village. The viewer doesn't learn who he is or why he's there until the final 30 minutes or so. Until then he's staying at The Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu). Jack is probably one of my favorite characters because of his personality. He gives off this very calm, cool, collective vibe that Crowe does a wonderful job of pulling off. He's here for business and he doesn't have time to waste.<br /><br />My main reason for seeing this was RZA. Up until now he's appeared in some small roles here and there, but The Man With The Iron Fist is the first time he's getting the chance to play a major character. RZA plays an unnamed blacksmith who makes weapons for the rival clans. He's not on any specific side, he's just trying to save up enough money so he can leave Jungle Village withLady Silk (Jamie Chung), his girlfriend and a prostitute at the Pink Blossom. I think the goal was to make this blacksmith the main character, but any effort to pull that off was eliminated when he's absent for majority of the first half.<br /><br />I think that's where I kind of got turned off. I enjoy films that follow a specific character/set of characters throughout the entire film. The Man With The Iron Fists is one of those films that jumps back and forth between multiple people. You have Silver Lion, Jack Knife, Madam Blossom, Brass Body (Dave Batista), and the blacksmith. Because there's so many key characters it's hard to form any sort of connection with any of them. That's not to say that they're all empty shells. On the contrary, I already mentioned my love for Jack, but Madam Blossom proves to be a pretty badass character and Brass Body (cheesy name aside) is interesting as well. The thing is that they only get brief spurts of screen time here and there which makes it hard to really care.<br /><br />My biggest issues, however, were the special effects and the predictability of the story. There's a scene within the first five minutes where a man is being attacked by a pack of wolves against what appears to be a barn door. It's obvious that these \\"wolves\\" are as fake as they come. In fact, these effects are so bad that when it cuts to this scene the color scheme changes from dark and solid to light and washed out. Then the fake blood used throughout the movie is just awful. There's been movies where the fake blood looks like fake blood, but this didn't even resemble blood at all. Whenever there was a spurt of blood erupting from a mouth, stab wound, etc. it looked like cherry soda. Part of me feels that this was intentional just to add to the cheesiness, but either way it just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />Then there was the story. Don't get me wrong, there were some things that I wasn't expecting, but majority of the time I said \\"This is probably goingto happen.\\" and sure enough it did. For example, there was a scene where the Lions stayed at The Pink Blossom and the women were ordered to \\"entertain\\" them. Right away I said \\"Lady Silk is going to get Brass Body\\". You wanna know what happened? Brass Body came into her room and wound up beating her to a pulp. I mean I understand that this is normal to include things like this because we've seen it done so many times in the past, but don't you think it's time that someone breaks the cycle?<br /><br />What really drives this film though is the performances from the cast members. It's clear that RZA is still a developing actor so don't expect some breathtaking performance, but considering that this is his first major role he did a solid job. Russell Crowe gave a great performance as Jack which more than makes up for his lackluster effort in Broken City. Rick Yune and Lucy Lui gave great performances as well, as did David Bautista, Byron Mann, and Jamie Chung. A lot of great performances from a pretty well-rounded cast.<br /><br />Overall Score: 6/10 - To be totally honest I expected more from The Man With The Iron Fists. From start to finish it felt really cluttered and directionless and the ending felt sudden and underwhelming. If you're a fan of kung-fu movies and you know what to expect then it would be very easy for me to recommend this to you. For everyone else I would advise you to go in with an open mind. While I personally can't say that I'll ever watch this again, I don't regret taking the time to experience it because when it's all said and done it was a nice ride.

B0027MJU00|5.0|If you need at least one likable character to cling to when you read a book, you should probably stay away from \\"Dark Places.\\" If you're open to exploring worlds seldom examined in any fiction, you can get through graphic brutality and oppressively bleak situations, and you like a well-written, well-plotted thriller, you might like Gillian Flynn's \\"Dark Places\\" a lot.<br /><br />The aptly titled \\"Dark Places,\\" set on failing farms and poor urban neighborhoods in Kansas and Missouri, spends its time with people who grasp at straws for security as tornadoes approach and explores depression on many levels.  When Libby Day was seven years old in 1985, her mother Patty and two older sisters were brutally murdered in what a voracious press called \\"The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.\\" Her brother Ben has, on Libby's testimony, sat in jail for 25 years for the murders. The $321,000 trust fund that well-meaning strangers established for Libby after the murders is running out. Libby, raised in a series of homes with relatives and foster care, has often not even got out of bed for days on end as an adult. She must now find something to do for money. She responds to an inquiry from the Kill Club, a group of true crime aficionados devoted to the study of notorious murders. A few Club members believe Ben is innocent. For pay, Libby agrees to interview people who might know something about what really happened and report her findings to the Club.<br /><br />The story unfolds in shifting narratives between Libby in the present day (told first person) and Ben and Patty on the day before the murders (told third person). Patty Krause Day is one of the most remarkable characters in fiction, largely because she is so ordinary. A Kansas farm girl, Patty married the wild Runner Day young. She soon found herself divorced from the useless, drunken Runner with four children and far more than she could handle trying to keep up the farm, which had been in her family for generations. She couldn't reach the moody adolescent Ben, and her girls wore her out. She mixed up water and ketchup as soup for the children. The brutally cold Kansas winter had set in to stay for several months. Even well-managed midwestern farms were in crisis, and Patty had neither capital, coping skills nor initiative to hang on. The bank was about to foreclose on the farm.  Meanwhile Ben, a high school outcast, went to extremes to try to fit in, hanging out with some wild kids who partied hard and dabbled in satanic rituals, and engaging in questionable conduct in his volunteer interactions with younger girls in his school. Ben's unsavory associations combined with Libby's testimony made him an obvious target for the murder investigation and a community anxious to put the matter behind them. He did little to help his own case.<br /><br />Author Flynn is at her best capturing the bleak boredom of small town adolescence and the cumulative effect of years of hardship, disappointment, bad choices and failures on Patty. Unlike so many female fiction protagonists, Patty is not the author of her life. She is well-intentioned but weak-willed woman to whom things, mostly bad things, happen. The reader feels for Patty as she unravels under the harsh glare of her judgmental neighbors, and feels for Ben as he takes desperate measures to assuage his loneliness, try to be cool and belong somewhere. The initially sour, dour Libby finds surprising strength in herself as her investigation proceeds and becomes more likable as the book proceeds, but it's safe to say she'll never be elected president of her local Junior League.<br /><br />Whether Flynn is describing the frozen Kansas prairie, a shantytown in a dump in Texas, or a boy who has become a man in prison, her way with words is striking.  She leads her readers to a satisfying conclusion. I would not recommend \\"Dark Places\\" to everyone, but I found it gripping, thought-provoking and insightful.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Loved this quick, easy read.  You really fall in love with the characters, so much that you'll miss them when the book is over!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I have now read all three of Gillian Flynn's novels. I am so happy to have a new favorite author who combines memorably skillful writing with an imagination as twisted as mine. I loved the Gothic \\"Sharp Objects\\" best of all Flynn's books.<br /><br />Camille Preaker, the world-weary, beautiful, self-harming 32-year-old journalist narrator, reluctantly obeys the order of her editor at her third rate Chicago daily paper to return to her childhood home in the small Missouri boot heel town of Wind Gap. The editor wants Camille to write feature stories about the vicious murder of a young girl there. Wind Gap, a sort of Maycomb, Alabama, on a bad acid trip, is populated by Grand Guignol characters. These include Camille's bizarre mother Adora, foppish stepfather Alan, and seriously twisted thirteen-year-old half-sister Amma. Adora, the proprietress of a wretched factory pig farm (you will be willing to pay the extra $5 a pound for free-range meat after reading \\"Sharp Objects\\"), still mourns the death of her second daughter years before and presides over Wind Gap adult society as its wealthiest person and largest employer. Amma presides over Wind Gap junior high society as head of the \\"mean girl\\" clique, precociously indulging in sex, drugs and manipulation. Camille's dreaded return to her childhood bedroom in Adora's Victorian mansion begins uncomfortably and goes from bad to worse as the murder investigation proceeds and we get acquainted with a wider circle of Wind Gap inhabitants.<br /><br />If you require plausible mystery, don't bother with \\"Sharp Objects.\\" You will probably find the characters and situations too over the top for your liking.  If you like Shirley Jackson's tales of the macabre, come on in. Though not quite as accomplished a stylist as Ms. Jackson, Flynn's gifts, like Jackson's, lie in her ability to create memorable characters, her descriptive power and her incisive observations, in this case about the claustrophobia of small-town life and the ways women exercise power and control. Sights, sounds, smells and textures jump off Flynn's pages.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more from Gillian Flynn.

B00AFQC4QC|5.0|The Luck of The Weissensteiners:<br />Christoph Fischer<br /><br />Sometimes chance meetings can change your entire life and at other times they can cause a downward spiral. Author Christop Fischer's the Luck of the Weissensteinrs brings to light what happens when a young woman named Greta falls for a young man named Wilhelm hoping to join two families together at a time when being Jewish required hiding it from the community and living a lie was your only means of survival. As we meet the families of both Greta and Wilhelm we learn about the younger years of parents, their family's goals and their hopes for their future. Jonah, Greta's father decided to hide the fact they were Jewish, not observe his religion and even attend church services. Greta would follow suit in a different way when marrying Wilhelm, having a young son and then converting in order to be welcomed in the Catholic Church. The times were volatile, the feelings about Jews not friendly, prejudice was evident, tolerance did not exist and two young people started their lives based on a single lie. But, there is much more that tears them apart, their families and those they love.<br /><br />The history of Czechoslovakia and Russia is extensive and the anti-Semitic feelings quite apparent. Even with the marriage of these two young people, the fact that Greta's family came to live with them on the farm, worked the farm and were really not welcome did not hamper the fact that their presence enhanced the productivity of the farm.<br /><br />The story centers around two families, their lives, futures and the events that are created during a time when hate, prejudice and a war were just on the corner. The story begins as Greta and Wilhelm have a whirlwind courtship. She loves to read and he is a German bookseller who enjoys supply her with reading material to suit her tastes despite that she is of a Jewish background. The times were changing, tensions were high and although Greta loved having her family live with her, Wilhelm's mother Johanna resented not only her but also everything that her family did or stood for. When her brothers decided to leave and pursue other careers, she literally fumed, Wilhelm's father was incensed and the two families would forever be split and the chasm so wide it might never be closed. But, Johanna is quite devious and Wilhelm's loyalties are not with Greta, her family and her heritage. Can you really hide who you really are and where you come from? Can Greta abandon her family, their values and remain true to what Wilhelm's family wants? Why Wilhelm believe the words written in a pamphlet without really researching the truths about Jewish people? Why would he desert his wife and leave her to fend for herself? Conforming to the wishes, whims and desires of others in order to be a part of the new government, new party and what political arenas are in the forefront in Germany.  Prejudice, hate, children and adults cast aside and the end result a holocaust so horrific and so many persecuted because of the hate and narrow mindedness of a few. Listen to the words, thoughts and feelings of each character and the narrator as we learn more about Greta, her failings, her strengths and the real life experiences depicted in this novel.<br /><br />Deceptions, lies, betrayals, hate, prejudice and fear are just some of the themes that run through this novel as we hear the voices of so many who thrived on persecuted the Jews. When the Hitler invaded Poland and 50,000 Slovak troops assisted. Greta although shocked and Johanna and Benedikt aware of much more never thought to tell her the truth, nor did they relate anything about Wilhelm and why he would never be in touch with her. Justifying his own actions, not really caring that he had another son, life became more like a real prison for Greta. But, an incident that the author relates brings to light just what would and was happening to many Jewish girls and Jews in general as Wilma sneaks off to seeher family and what she experiences at the hand of some German soldiers and the Slovaks brings to light the cruel and inhumane treatment of Jews and so many others but the worst has yet to come. So many living in fantasy worlds and so many falling prey to what Hitler wanted. Living on the farm was anything but happy for Greta and being at the mercy of Wilhelm's parents might not prove safe after all. Land reforms taking away the rights of Jews to own land and worse some farms confiscated many people deported. Some allowed to remain under certain circumstances others chose to leave. Johanna hated Great and was worried that in revenge for losing their farms the Jews would try and take them down with them. The hate was so strong you could feel it in the air. Denmark surrendered to Germany and Norway was invaded. The war was on and even Greta's brother was fighting for the other side. But, would Johanna protect Greta and her young son? What would happen if Greta knew that Wilhelm had divorced her? Wanting her to leave whether by force or on her own account the decision was going to be made and her reaction quite compelling. The inevitable advent of WWII and the hopes of survival this novel will take readers inside the minds of the Germans, those Jews that are forced into labor camps, the rationale behind the thinking of these two families and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Bratislava was not hit as hard or yet and many non-Jews hated the Nazi's and tried hard to harbor their Jewish friends hoping to keep them safe. Hardships that were unbearable, families broken apart and a war that will remain in the hearts of and minds of many forever.<br /><br />The Weissensteiners remained where they were and hoped to whether the war and the end result for so many. Prejudice is one of the strongest themes, anti-Semitism even stronger and the changes within the continent, government a Diaspora group of you might say colonists lost within their own world. As Greta will soon learn that being born a Jew and converting does not make you any the less a Jew and trust comes with a high price. When Greta realizes the gravity of her situation, the truth behind what Wilhelm did and her what her in-laws think is best for her what will the final outcome be? How will she react? What is the ultimate betrayal?<br /><br />Arriving back with her family would bring to light just how difficult Wilma's life had been and more questions would be raised about those who might reveal their true heritage. Living within this secret for over 20 years and coming to Bratislava unnoticed would that change? But, those remaining with Johanna and Bendikt, minus Greta would soon learn just how difficult life would be. But, would Johanna feel any guilt about what she did to Greta? Did she even care?<br /><br />The Weissensteiner family fared will for quite a while, and Greta's younger brother Egon's career advanced in the army. Safe, having friends would that last forever? The author takes readers through the year 1941 as we learn more about Johanna, those working for her, their betrayals, when the German army would attack Russia. All through this Greta's family was not aware of Egon's rise and she kept busy with her young child and still harbored her feelings about losing her first born. But, Jonah's involvement with a woman named Alma might bring more than just danger in their lives. As his housekeeper and he her employer can they keep it a secret?<br /><br />Worse than being hated is being branded you might say as the Jewish population was forced to wear Yellow Jewish Badges to indentify them as Jews. They were banned from movie theaters, parks, cafes, using public transportation and much more. Curfews were imposed on them and they were no longer allowed to own cars, radios or cameras. Would Jonah identify himself as a Jew or stay true to what he was already doing and deny his heritage for his family's safety? Having friends in high places helped Jonah and his family when theirname was placed on the list to be sent to a labor camp. Fortunately, someone made sure it disappeared. We enter 1942 and then Bratislava 1943 where Jonah's friendship with the Countess greatly helped, She hopes that the war would end and was glad that she was able to bring Jonah and his family to her Estate. The experience would be great, the Wilma seemed to have snapped losing her love of anything that had brought her any joy. Her mental status seemed to be in decline and her fear of everything more prevalent. With Alma providing the news from outside their confines and then the German army was defeated and Jonah was worried. The suicide of a friend brings things into focus and what will Jonah and his family do next? Papers in place, documents needed would he remain at the Manor with the countess, would they learn the truth about him and what about Wilma? Would they realize she needed more help?<br /><br />The end of the war but not the end of their plight as the Czechs were seeking out Germans and revenge was sweet. We hear the Countess express her regrets saying she wished should could have helped more, the loyalty of Edith and Esther and the hopes that Greta and her family would be safe. Entering a camp Alma and Jonah befriended many people and finally made their way back home. The war is over the prejudices are just as strong and now one family that hid their heritage reveal the truth. One young man denied his mother and adopted by another part of the Winkelmeier family. One man who deserted his wife because of what he read and the influence of others.<br /><br />The final outcome of each member is quite compelling, the descriptions of the refugee camps vivid, the end result quite revealing. Many survived others gave up and one young woman would learn the truth but will she ever be reunited with her son? What about her father, brother and Wilma? This story spans a time period where one man's fury reigned and ruled so many different countries, dominated so manygovernments and allowed so many to be tortured, killed, maimed and gassed because he hated them. What happens to Greta and the rest you will learn when you read the heartbreaking epilogue and learn the harsh realities of the times? One outstanding novel. One author whose research is extensive and so many scenes and conversations so vividly depicted he takes readers back to where it all began: Bratislava: Who comes home? The Luck of The Weissensteiners: After reading this novel you decide whether fate really did hand them a lucky hand. You decide: the Weissensteiners and the Winkelmeier: joined in marriage but never really as one.<br /><br />Lets dedicate this to all those who lost their lives at the hands of those who never really understood that different beliefs are what makes the world so special.
B000I9X53W|5.0|Great performances, clever script idea--it still holds up.  I used this in my acting scene class and did a reverse--female talent agent, female actor who can't get work--great to work with!
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Fascinating and profound - Jim Carey entertainment with a deeper vision. For anyone who has noticed the cracks in the façade, and seeks the whole truth - but finds it awful hard to get outside the paradigm. How easy it is to label such seekers madmen - to try and call off the search, to keep you in the box. The final scene says it all. No spoilers!
B009NG1Q96|2.0|I loved The Selection. It was a 5 star book in my opinion. I liked it so much I got The Prince novella, which turned out to be pretty much The Selection written (poorly) from Maxton's POV. But I held out hope...The Elite is not nearly as bad as The Prince, but it's...meh. It turns very dark, which would have been fine if there was actually a point to the darkness. Or, for that matter, the entire book. The only point seems to be dragging the story so we'd have to buy the 3rd one. There are no resolutions and some parts simply defy my willingness to suspend disbelief or try to understand the characters' motives. I'm fairly disappointed in this book.
B005HSL626|3.0|Same as android app. very slow on tablet alright on my Samsung galaxy s III though, it was free what can u say
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Liked the movie, better than most movies out now. TC was good in this one also, but he is usually good in all his roles. Seems to get better with age.

B0056JJ1M8|3.0|Once is enough. ok movie. Story line is pretty much like most sports movies, but the ending is a little different.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Very surprising plot. Great movie if you are in the mood for funny with a plot that makes you think.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|If you want to learn how to love someone in a way they feel loved, read this book.<br />Most people love people back the way they feel loved, this doesn't work so well in most cases unless your love language is the same
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Amazing record, nothing else to say. If you already like them theres is no worries, buy it now.<br />Being a fan since 95, they will still keep me busy listening to another masterpiece for a long time.
0393964582|5.0|The truly great part of this edition that sets it apart from the rest is the easy access footnotes that help add to understanding and enhance the reading experience. Get this version!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Glad I read it.  Author a little annoying at first, but her story drew me in.  I imagine many more will attempt the Trail after reading this...
B00942G4UA|5.0|What an eye opener, I definitely, don't view or will view food or the marketing strategies to get you to buy the food the same way again..
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I loved this movie, it was sooo cute and then right after seeing it I went to the San Diego zoo
B0067AC5KA|5.0|FANTASTIC TRILOGY. THIS HAD HISTORICAL AND FICTIONAL INTREST THAT KEPT MY ATTENTION THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO MY FREINDS AND FAMILY.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love how the animals don't go hungry and the best thing about it is that you can see the complete list of all the animals
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The game is pretty fun.  Its a good learning aid for kids.  I do wish they didn't have quests you had to buy stuff.  The bright side is the game is free.  Down side is not much you can do at one time.
B000ICM5O4|5.0|Note: I have the tracks, except Gonna Fly Now, in mp3 format.<br /><br />The soundtrack to the first ROCKY is really good. My personal favourite tracks are: Going The Distance, Reflections, Marines' Hymn/Yankee Doodle Dandy, First Date, You Take My Heart Away (which has echoes of Gonna Fly Now, foreshadowing ROCKY IV, wherein a few bars of the famous song are incorporated into Hearts On Fire at the end of the second training montage), Alone In The Ring and The Final Bell.<br /><br />Whatever you may think of the film ROCKY V, the soundtrack is pure garbage (saving the song Measure Of A Man).
B000FC1KBG|1.0|The information in this book re: breastfeeding is flat out wrong in places. Which is awful for someone calling herself a lactation consultant. I can't trust a lactation consultant who considers formula feeding as beneficial as breast milk. Formula feeding is appropriate in many cases, but to consider it as good as breast milk is wrong. And the way she portrayed this decision actually made me frustrated and angry.<br />It is also apparently wrong to carry your baby or nurse them to sleep. I read this book because my sister said it was extremely beneficial to them with their first child, but I found it to be a waste of my time. There are nuggets that are helpful to people that are lost in parenting, but since I already listen to my babies cues and talk to my baby, I didn't find it helpful to me. In addition, since I ascribe to a belief that its ok to carry or wear my baby, and to nurse on demand, this book just made me feel sad, and to argue with myself over my parenting choices.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Very fun puzzler that is pretty cool.  I like the graphics as well as the funny little remarks within the game
B003UMW68O|5.0|Great movie, Our great grandson loves the movie and watches it over and over again.  I would recommend to anyone with kids.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|I love this movie and it streamed perfectly.  It is an oldie but it was good.  I really enjoyed watching it again.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Loved this device immediately I started using it.  I had heard it took some getting used it, but that wasn't really the case for me, but I can see it being somewhat difficult for precise positioning.  So happy with it that I've also ordered the Notebook version.  I'm mainly using it with the latest versions of Alibre (now GeoMagic Design) and Altium Designer, both of which worked out of the box.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it is awesome it has all the things that your little racing buddy needs any ways grate game hope you guys make a second one if you haven't already
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great quality and well written show with great PQ and SQ. I highly recommend this series who love quality written shows.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Fast paced, lots of plot twists, great action-a must see.  One of the best, if not the best, television series of all time!!

B000J670ZI|4.0|Great movie.  Love both actors and together they are a great comedy pair.  I don't have seven more words to describe a classic movie.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Saw it on the big screen and had to watch again at home!  Fantastic movie!  Quintin did it again...as always!!
B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|All I listen to is EDM. I read that this album was supposed to be a little different and it definitely is. It sounds like a combination of dance music and disco.  I suggest previewing the songs before buying the whole album if your sensitive towards spending $12.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This is more challenging than I expected.  I try to improve my score every day.  It can be a little frustrating at times.  There are a few predictable things that happen in the game.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|The author has a decent storyline, and while the characters are pretty much two dimensional, either all good or all bad, I can live with that. What bothers me is when the author writes &#34;he had never felt so much a part of anything before.&#34; Or words to that effect, at least once in every book.<br />Or Princess Gwen takes Thor to a special secret garden, lake, or mini castle  that she's never taken anyone before, in every book. Seriously, how many special places that no one else knows about in the castle environs, can this woman have?<br />In the first three books we hear that Thor has a special destiny, which suddenly for no reason changes in book 4,and it's his destiny to be killed. (He gets saved). It's just annoying when the author doesn't take care with the storyline.
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|another horrible movie I bought, I guess you have no choice but to take your chances with no preview, another movie sent to the horrible movie box!!
B004V71CYQ|5.0|Great movie, the effects were obviously lacking due to the age of the movie but the story was compelling and kept me interested.
B0038AUY96|3.0|Harry Hole as good as ever. Looking forward reading the next one in the series. Never fails to provide a great thrilller.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|I was very exciting to get my favorite movies, again, now in Blu-ray, but when I started to see The Return of the Jedi I was very very disappointed, the image quality was poor, the color correction was awful, you can see the blacks, ones are reddish, others are bluish, that movie was NOT remastered, Star Wars looks good, The Empire Strikes Back was great, but the last one, terrible, just terrible.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I bought this for a road trip, and this device came very handy!!<br />I used to charger iphone5, and ipad mini simultaneous and it charged in full speed as it say on the description<br />I been using this for everyday for past week, and never had issue. the socket does not loss.. The best thing is their LED light is not as bright as other brand I had used.<br />We all know how the bright LED light can be annoying driving at night.<br /><br />I recmommned this to anyone<br />It is inexpensive item<br />came in very nice packaging with instruction and how to contact if there is any problem<br />18 months warranty is a Plus!!!<br />I like their product so much that I bought a 13000mah power bank from them, can't wait to test it!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved everything about this book and read in a marathon session. An uplifting story with loads of humour and never a dull moment.
1609613937|5.0|Love the concept.  Am going to Dr. McDougal's 10 day program in Santa Rosa this summer, so I wanted to get a heads up on what he teaches.  I'm trying to incorporate his ideas right away.  It's tough, but I think he's on to something!
B008DJBMO8|5.0|Give this a chance..Mel may have problems BUT as an actor he is one of my favorites. This has made me laugh and the plot needs to be followed...enjoy
193700788X|5.0|To be honest I expected this book to be terrible, after reading so many harsh reviews. However, I must disagree with most of them. I think the ending is perfect. It may be unpredictable for some, but I think this ending is the only one that fits. I agree that it was a little unsettling that this book was written at times from a third person perspective, but I can't say the writing is much different from previous books. I think Harris tried to give more depth to these characters by describing them from a third person perspective (although I do agree this type of style is not her strong suit). Harris tried to tie the loose ends with every character and I think she did it successfully enough to make it feel complete.<br />Warning, SPOILERS below:<br /><br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br /><br />Everyone seems to be going on about the fact that Sookie had to stay with Eric. But why would you want this for her? Eric is selfish and old, not a good match for Sookie. The way he treated her many times was less than desirable for a long time companion. She hated him in the beginning, remember?  Sam has been a long time friend, has always been in love with her, and Sookie was scared to screw up a good thing by bringing sex into it. I think this is the perfect evolution of the story. Sookie went through different ordeals with Bill, Quinn, Eric and now has a great comparison sample. She should stay with Sam, because he is loyal, actually loves her and knows her the best. To be partners, you have to be friends first and Sam proved over and over that he puts Sookie first - it just took a while for Sookie to understand that what she wanted all along was in front of her all this time.
B006RBZV82|4.0|Gorgeous filming, but narrative was lackluster (which surprised me).  Makes me appreciate the writing done for Planet Earth & other series.  Somehow it just didn't flow like it should.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This film deserves more recognition than it got. This movie adaptation is absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend this to any and all history lovers out there.
B00AO2TREY|5.0|It is refreshing to hear pop music that is made to sound good, instead of being made to appeal to the current taste of the mass collective.  While I prefer the first album from Hurts - Happiness, this is still an outstanding album and far superior to anything that's high on the popularity chart.  If you like Mumford & Sons, fun, Nicki, Maroon 5, Bruno Mars and One Republic, then avoid this and go on being part of the collective.  If you want to hear some crisp, slick pop, then buy this.
B008R14YBK|5.0|Bridgit Mendler not only has acting down, and now here it is her debut album! She has an absolute wonderful voice. I highly recommend this album to everyone out there.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Really enjoyed this - downloaded it to watch while flying. Good airplane movie, nothing that would offend anyone. I did figure out the ending (sorta) before the ending, but yeah, it's geared toward kids, so no too complicated plot. Might have to purchase it for my own DVD collection to have around when the nieces and nephews visit!
B003Z9Q548|5.0|In all honesty I had originally bought this for a few of the songs, but once I had it playing i ended up falling in love with all of the songs on the album. I am very happy with this purchase and strongly feel that you will too! you will not be disappointed.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's fun a lot like fishville on Facebook but I love nemo the movie is great and the game is entertaining.
B004J4WQ46|5.0|Great CD by a great band! I highly recommend this CD to any Strokes fan. This arrived to me on time and in perfect condition.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|This was a great movie being the sequel to Casino Royale. I thought the story plot was amazing as James Bond trying to figure out Vespers life and death etc. he seems still in love with her in the beginning but by the end he seems oVer her and I thought, &#34;Yay! Now we can get married!&#34; I reccomend this to anyone who liked Casino Royale and do watch Casino Royale first because a lot of it relates to things that happen in that movie. I need to get my friends to watch it with me!! Go James Bond!!
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|I love this new album, &#34;The Strokes&#34; are one of my all time faves and this new album just proves to me why once again, I love this band!

B002ZG975Q|5.0|This movie has a modern &#34;Beauty and the Beast&#34; twist to it. i love it and have a feeling that you will to!
B004S5FW1U|2.0|This is the first book I can truly say that turned out better as a movie. Too much fotball...looong sections of it. Disappointing, as the main characters were quite good.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Another great CD by the Strokes, I highly recommend this one to any Strokes fan. This arrived on time and in perfect condition!
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|Some great songs, do like this band and have another of their CD's, some new and fresh sounds. Shipped very fast, thank you.

B0053O8AQE|5.0|This is easily my favorite TV show on right now. This show is hilarious, Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs are perfectly matched for this show. I can't think of anyone better to have played their parts!
B00632HWOG|5.0|The features are visually pleasing, easy to use and navigate.  lots of additions make this app feel like a powerhorse.  wish my gmail app would do the same.  no mor jumping around from app to app, this one has all features like what your pc has.  love it!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I bought this for my mom for mothers day. Although i still have yet to watch it, I did see this movie at the theater. This is an absolutely wonderful remake. If you are a fan of the Broadway stage production, I highly recommend you give this movie a try.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|I found this album flirts with the playful and the morose with tracks you could exercise or contemplate nothingness to.
B000065V3H|5.0|i love this movie! I highly recommend this to any 80's movie fans out there. For the price of the movie and quality of shipping, you couldn't possibly ask for anything more.
B000E97HIA|5.0|What can you say about Prince Rodgers Nelson?  What a regal name for a regal man. He is another one of a kind artist. Prince is multi- talented multi-faceted artist. Prince does it all writes,produces, and plays a variety of instruments. What a talent? He does exactly what's he chooses too.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Once again they don't disappoint. This band has it all, in my opinion. I highly recommend this album to all Strokes fans out there.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I was able to down load this program on my kindle fire, although it refused to work. I would rate it lower but it will not let me
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|i love this band! This album is absolutely terrific. I highly recommend this album to all music lovers out there.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|i mean im a bit annoyed its not available on Netflix, but for 3 bucks its still a great deal in terms of watching this classic.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|If you are looking for a little now and a little then, this is the movie for you! This movie is terrific and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I really enjoy Sophie Kinsella novels. This one was light and fun. It's a story about sisters told from their two very different perspectives. I liked it!
B008O037RG|5.0|As their second album, it is terrific, once again, Mumford does not disappoint. I received this album in perfect condition and it was a day early. Could not be happier!
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a great movie that's selling at regular price even though it's not new.  I ordered a used one from Amazon and paid much less than the store prices right now. Plus it shipped quickly.  Thank goodness for that since my toddler kept asking to watch it!
B004QIG7CW|5.0|Okay okay, I know yes, it is a Disney movie and yes it can be cheesy at times, but, this movie is adorable. I highly recommend this one to anyone.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I am a big fan of Michael Connelly and the Bosch novels. However, this book felt like the ending was rushed.  I did enjoy it but it left the idea of Bosh committing kidnapping and brutality were a little over the top and didn't feel believable that it wouldn't come out in court.  Enjoyed it but not his best work.  I do recommend the book, almost a 5 but just not spectacular.
B002GOAH1U|5.0|This movie is wonderful! I highly recommend this movie to any teenager and mom out there. This movie is one of my mom's and my favorites, we've probably seen it 30+ times and never tire of this movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a very good game I bought it fans I didn't stop until I finished it . Love it and keep on the good work.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars has a style unlike many artists out there right now. With a style like his and a voice like his he will be around for quite a while.
B002QYSZBO|5.0|I honestly only watched it because a review for Iron Man 3 mentioned this was the second time RDJ and Shane Black were working together, and they referenced this movie.  I thought, sure, I'll watch it.  Even the fact that it was rated R didn't stop me.  I only enjoyed this and the first Hangover films because I could care less about such films.<br /><br />I loved seeing a different kind of character for Robert. I've only seen him in films as the character that seems to know everything.  It was weird seeing him play the idiot or the very lost guy.  Great performances, even from Val Kilmer, who I've heard little about.<br /><br />Pretty racy and a lot of cussing, but it's hilarious.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show just keeps getting better.  I cannot wait to see where it goes in the next season.  Just hope the Governor storyline doesn't drag on too long.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Our whole family loves Pitch Perfect.  While the singing is not fantastic, it is super fun to watch.  I wish there was a few longer takes but maybe that just didn't happen.
B00CKQ1092|5.0|A very soid album from DEP. They continue to be on top of their game. Melodic but still DEP! I really am enjoying it!
B0085OEU1I|3.0|I wish the two actors would enunciate.  Makes for a trial.  Family just saw a community college version and said it was substantially better .  Kind of sorry I purchased.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie was listed as long, but I enjoyed it so much,that the time went by very quickly. Daniel Day Lewis did an awesome job.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|This is an amazing movie!  It is a hollywood classic and a must see!  Of course, after seeing this...Funny Lady is a must!
B008A1NSTG|4.0|Movie was cute. A good relaxing story to watch on a quiet night or rainy day. Love Drew Barrymore, so this was a win, win for me from the start.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is a great mix between RPG elements and match-3 slider gameplay. I would liken it to PuzzleQuest in that you can build up your character with experience points and better equipment and you match 3, but there isn't a board you move around. You crawl through a randomly generated dungeon, unlocking doors & chests and defeating monsters, which populate the dungeon based on your character level. A very well-executed game, to be sure.
B006BQFUOS|5.0|I had first read the book and when I heard there was a movie, I had to see it. Loved the movie. The book was better, as most books usually are, but the movie caught the important parts. Moving!!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|So, yeah. The game runs flawlessly on my HD Maxx. By this point, nearly everyone with a smartphone or tablet has played some iteration of Fruit Ninja and most everybody loves it. I am no different. Great, fun, addictive gameplay that can waste five minutes of your time or... an hour if you aren't careful.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I don't watch very much TV - find most of the programs on it not worth the time.  However, this show is the one exception.  When I want to wind down and laugh this fits the bill.  I hadn't seen much of the first season so it was really nice to be able to download it from Amazon and watch it in order as my schedule permitted, without advertising!!  Highly recommend it.
1416972250|5.0|This was written for my blog [...]  -----------------------------------------------  I think this was my favorite book so far! It only took me about 1.5 days to read it, as it was between sleep and work. Lots of action going on from beginning to end. We learn there is more to the Shadowhunter world (what more is there to learn?). And Jace comes across as more human than he ever has, which is a nice change. He's only ever appeared as stoic and only seems to show emotions when he is in very close contact with Clary.    The difference with this book is the changes in Point of View. Jace's mind and thoughts are definitely more complex and emotional than his non-verbal body language expresses. Finally after three books Jocelyn wakes up! The path to get there is long-winded and twisted with new characters and information, but the end result is well worth it. As readers Jocelyn provides us with a critical plot changer; one that makes me very happy!    We also get to see more of Jocelyn as she is in her fighting mind set and see her interaction with those around her, namely Luke. With Valentine, while he is evil, he does come across as a semi-loving father to Jonathan and he's cast in a new light for me. The ending scenes where the book is leading up to (like the previous two books) is epic! Two big fight scenes which, as like the City of Bones and City of Ashes, throw in a plot twister once again.    plot: A+    This book has the best plot of them all so far! I very much enjoyed delving in to the crazy Morgenstern life of Clary, Jonathan, Jocelyn, and Valentine. CoG was also a quick read in that I was so absorbed with the telling of Clary's life that the pages passed very quickly. The action throughout the book kept the reader wanting more and easily made me want to get into the next book.    character: A    Without giving too much away, we were introduced to Sebastian who becomes central to the story plot and serves his purpose for introduction. So far every new characterthat has been given a part in this story has had a part to play in the plot and aren't just there for distraction sake.    readability: A+    City of Glass was a very easy read for me in that I was well versed in the `Shadowhunter' lingo by this point in the series and scenes blended from one into the other. Again like the previous books, this one was divided into three sections that gives the reader an idea of how far they are into reading.    romance: B+    Clary seems to get quite a bit of romance in this book between Jace and Sebastian, though while reading and after have ick factors. Jocelyn and Luke seemed to pick up right where they left off when she fell into the induced-coma. Things seem to continue sparking for Simon and Isabelle but they haven't come out as an official couple. Also, the biggest romance of the books, Alec and Magnus! Their relationship has had its ups and downs and for those that ship them will be very happy by the ending.    length: A    As stated above, I liked the chapter lengths and the three divisions within the book to help keep pacing and give an idea of how far in to the book I was. I think at this point we're about a month or two from the beginning of the series when Clary finds out about Shadowhunters, and still Cassie has found a way to make it seem like it was much longer in time than it actually was.    Favorite Scene:  The entire fight sequence between Jace & Clary vs. demons. Clary has really come a long way since the first book and I'm glad to see her come into her own person. She's still learning but this fight scene shows that she is becoming a real Shadowhunter and following in her mother's footsteps. While she might not be able to fully take on a demon by herself she can at least stand her own until help arrives. Go Clary!    Favorite Quote:  \\"There is no pretending,\\" Jace said with absolute clarity. \\"I love you, and I will love you until I die, and if there is life after that, I'll love you then.\\" - Jace Lightwood
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|This is a great kids show that everyone including the adults will love and bust out laughing.<br />All the Shaun the Sheep seasons are great.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|It's not often that I don't get to the end of a book but it just started to irritate me. The whole theme of it just kept making me think of Forrest Gump.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I love it when movies based on books stay true to the book! I love the books and was curious on how the short tom cruise was going to play the tall jack reacher. He was great!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I had a previous version of these headphones in my first home studio. I am so glad that I found these headphones again. They are true &#34;Studio Monitors&#34; with even, uncolored sound. Love them! Super quiet with the xlr plugs.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Plasma Sky is visually supurb, with fantastic neon graphics and runs very smoothly.  However, it takes less than an hour to get through all 80 levels.  There is an endless mode as well.<br /><br />Pros: stunning graphics, good controls, good sound.<br /><br />Cons: short!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Very great game. It has great graphics and it is very original ideas. Not only that but it is very addicting and time consuming. I only wish that it was more play to win and less pay to win, the gold farming is way too long and you get stuck in low level places so you are powerful enough to advance. Other than that, five stars.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Looking forward to more. The omnibus is the only way to read the book, and it was not what I expected.  This is not  a bad thing.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Don't waist your time. I fell asleep after the firs 15 minutes. I though it will be good but the true was something else
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is a fabulous character driven show.  Do not miss it!  I am currently working thru season 4 for the second time.  I almost never watch anything more than once!
B005HEPS6A|5.0|This is the season when Dr. Crusher returns. Great episodes, great acting. Adding Goldberg's character is also one of my favorite parts about this season.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|By returning to his usual genre John LeCarre has again written a compelling story that is hard to put down.  The plot revolves around an aborted operation to capture a terrorist in the Crown colony of Gibraltar and the aftermath that results in the resignation of a Minister of the Crown and the cover up that followed.  Good characterisations woven around linkages between various charaters makes for and interesting read that has a ring of truth to it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was so amazing! It hooked me and I could not put it down until I was literally sobbing at the end...I would recommend it to anyone looking for a book you can really connect with.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|A great remake of the old show.  With current flair but old style policing!  A must see every season! Will buy every year!
B001ANSSDC|1.0|The movie breathes character and warmth into what in the book is an unfortunate portrayal of bi-polar disorder as a form of mental retardation.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is fun and has great graphics. I love it. It's great for young kids (and older), and it is easy to play.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|My daughter had to read this for school and she had no complaints when it came to picking this book up and reading it.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I love the author and both previous works, I waited for almost 5 years for this book with great anticipation but felt completely underwhelmed. There were too many unnecessary story lines that added nothing to the overall plot and took away from what would have been a beautiful story had Pari and Abdullah been the focus of the work and the fall out from what happened to them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My first hunger book and loved it<br />  I never got into teen survival stories before, but now that I'm old, they seem fun.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|There are no words to describe this trilogy. I am so glad I picked up the first book to see what all the fuss was about.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Based on a true story but find some of the film implausible. Movie drags half way in I dozed off. Not what I expected & that's why it didn't make as much money as the Avengers!
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|It was one of the best books I have ever read!  So very interesting and very uplifting. I highly recommend it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have an awful time falling asleep and often suffer from insomnia.  I drive my husband nuts with the videos or background noise.  This app is the perfect solution and has some presets for concentration, relaxation, pre-sleep, deep meditation, dreams, REM sleep and lots of sounds to choose from.  It even has a timer.  I will use this app everyday!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Hooked. You can watch these episodes over and over and still catch new parts of the witty dialogue. And Harvey. Yum.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Vey well written & moved along at a steady pace bringing all the characters together. Absolutely enjoyable read & for followers of the series tied up all the loose ends & completed the story in a very satisfying way.
B00023BLXK|5.0|I loved this movie and it suddenly disappeared from our family collection when we moved so got it again but WAY cheaper than originally bought. The case was was pretty damaged, don't know if it was the post office or packaging but the disc (what really mattered most) was untouched and perfect. I can easily replace the case as long as I didn't have to wait again for the movie. Shipped well before its date and the movie was flawless as I remembered. ^_^
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I heard about this show from a lady into steampunk.  Loved the show , too bad there is only the one season and the movie.
157421327X|5.0|Great basics, hours of fun here and some simple designs the kids can have fun creating with, not sorry I purchased all three books at all
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I loved everything about it....had you on your toes the whole time! I am not one for watching the same movie over and over, but I would watch this one again!
1574214276|5.0|Some really great designs here it lives up to my expectations and is great for my reference for the future for something different
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|Amazon movies are so great! I have Toy Story 1, 2, & 3!! I am able to download the movies to the Kindle and my preschooler can watch her movie where ever we go without WiFi! On the road, at home, day or night. Love it! Quality is great and I have a quiet happy 3 year old. Nothing better :)<br />Thank you Amazon!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the best game in the world. It has an awesome graphic and is the best places for this type of game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is the best most fun app ever!!!!!! I just got it and am on the 4th level, but I am totally impressed with it already! So cute, and being a mario fan, this app is really fun. All mario fans out there , GET THIS APP!!!! IT IS FREE!!!!! :)
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I'd give this app 10/10. I love it it's AWESOME. This app was the free app of the day. I wish so badly that this app had more levels.... There's 80 epic levels of BLASTING! The modes are hardcore, conquest, and survival. I recommend buying this app. :P
B000FC1E2G|5.0|Classics are classics for a reason.  The writing style and the plot has both humor and tragedy.  I loved the characters, particularly Elizabeth Jane - a constant throughout and a quiet strength in the end.  The fatal flaw of the &#34;mayor&#34; ruins him, but  also reveals a man of greater depth.  This was not a caricature of any of the characters and Hardy was able to show the<br />vicissitudes of life's experiences as well as the multi sides of human behavior.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I'm lost 4 words, who isn't' a treck'e man too many words to sum up something you really like. Ok 15 Weiss
B00280LYHS|5.0|I absolutely love this book no doubt about it. Here are the reasons why:<br /><br />1: Nico di Angelo<br />2: PERCABETH!!!!!<br />3: Rachel<br />4: Tyson ( He's freaking awesome)<br />5: Well.... Nico! ( he's hot!)<br /><br />Overall this book is awesome sauce and I recommend it to anyone who loves Greek Mythology.
B004LQJPEG|5.0|I Great Movie Should be Part of Everyones DVD Collection, Gene Hackman is Fantastic.If you only Own one Gene Hackman Film it Should be this One.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|One of the best suspense novels I have read. David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors  when it comes the suspense novels.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Not as good as the first two... i was a bit disappointed.  Still, it's a good series that you might want to begin reading.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am glad that I read the book first.  I was much more aware of the underlying significance of the events in the movie and the interplay between the characters.  It made the action in the movie more meaningful.  Not sure how I would have appreciated the movie if I had not.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Reminds me so much of my crusty old uncle, who LOOKS and SOUNDS just like Clint in this movie!<br /><br />Well-done and an interesting ending.  I've watched this 3 or 4 times now and love having it in my library.
B0002IQHZM|5.0|Great Music CD for those who love Donovan and his kind of music....Of course I could not start any day without listening to music....It makes my day so much better.....If you love Donovan....I highly recommend this nice CD.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|This is not only one of the most amazing apps I have, it is also my favorite app for my Roku streaming box.  I've converted my entire DVD collection to mp4 files.  While it took longer and was more involved than when I i-podded my music and got rid of CD's years ago (due to many tv series that require separate rips for each episode and the need to follow certain naming conventions).. it was all worth it.  Now I can view my collection without having to open a single DVD and I can watch all of it from anywhere in the world.
0767840135|3.0|Some of the numbers were really great....The rest, I fell asleep on several occasions.  But whatever I might not like.....It might be a great success with somebody's else point of view.....
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This moving is very uplifting and funny. Great family movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Shows how fun college could be.
1416955070|4.0|My teenagers recommended this series to me, and with the impending release of the movie, I picked it up. First, as a rabid fan of the Harry Potter Series, I could not help but notice several similarities (copycatting?) of themes from Potter to Bones. Ignoring that, it was an enjoyable summer beach read. Candy for the mind. Currently I am reading book three, and find the series more enjoyable as it progresses.
B003DS9ECQ|4.0|If you enjoyed the Looney Tunes, and how can you not be a MJ fan?! You and your family will enjoy this movie!
1452113432|5.0|This book is full of great, easy to use recipes.  I want to buy this book for everyone in my family!<br />Cheri
B0084HJE0S|3.0|Good overview of HTML5 and the role JavaScript plays as part of the new web. Good read for the train ride home, but nothing you'll be likely to read again. Since it was free, I can't complain about the cost!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|So easy to clean up my Kindle Fire.  My internal storage is increased - thought I had cleaned up stuff by using ES File Explorer but Clean Master really did the trick.  Very easy to use.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Fringe is an interesting show with good acting that provides good entertainment for me. I think most people would like it if they give it a chance.
B009FAQ8IY|1.0|This is a great great movie totally spoiled by awful video &#34;remastering&#34; !<br /><br />Somebody show some respect for this masterpiece and spend some bucks to give it the presentation it deserves.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really like Suits. It has very interesting characters and the acting is very good. I have Direct TV with complete coverage so I can get future seasons of Suits on USA HD. I have plenty of money so I can afford to buy the second season of Suits from Amazon but I never will because they made it part of my Prime subscription for season one and then tried to sell me season two which I consider dirty pool. I think Amazon is one of the very best internet companies and that Prime is a great value but I think giving Prime customers one season of a show and making them buy the other seasons does not represent to me the kind of company that is Amazon who I thought always treated their customers fairly.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I really enjoyed Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. I loved the main character and his friends and how they all worked together to solve the mystery of the 24-Hour Bookstore and help Mr. Penumbra. This is a perfect book for someone who enjoys books, puzzles, mysteries, humor, and a little romance.
B00992CF6W|4.0|They should update mindcraft. Like lava, water, pistons,red stone, tracks, mindcart,lever,enchanting table,and stuff like that.more people will want the app<br /><br />  Please update mindcraft!!  ;)
0375851569|5.0|My 5 y/o enhanced his reading skills with it. Guess this is an excellent book collection for kids. Glad we have it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a good app but I wish they identified who's talking cause they just show a picture and also I wish the different activities didn't drain the horses energy quite as much. over all though its a good app.
B00A25NLOU|5.0|In San Francisco there is a 24 hour book store. It has 3 clerks, few modern books and large bookshelves at the back storing books that are lent out to the stores mysterious clients. The hero of this novel is one of those clerks and the story is of him discovering the mystery behind the book store and it's owner Mr Penumbra.<br /><br />I ripped through is book in less than three days. Its story covers the love of the printed word as well as the electronic one and touches on Google and it's workings. It's main character is very likeable and it gradually draws a cast of characters around him to build the momentum. The final reveal may be a little disappointing to some but I enjoyed the whole story and the premise of a mystery hidden within books. It's one of the best novels I have read this year and is highly recommended
0786891416|5.0|Fun Book, lots of action and quick reading.  Once you start reading you cannot put the book down.  Waiting for the next book.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|great cd.  Just as expected from Zac Brown Band.  Really liked the download ability also.  Have it on my phone and computer.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Violent, humorous, sad, sometimes boring, a satire, I wouldn't recommend it for everyone.  The content is for mature adults only.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|I<br /><br />i love this movie! it is a beautiful film with a bit of mystical whimsy along with more serious topics such as prejudice and the tyrannical treatment of women. I used to teach this movie, and after being retired a few years, I missed it so much, I had to buy it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much<br /> It is the best game ever I've always wanted a horse an  now I have one
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I have seen this, but I actually bought this for a gift. It is a favorite of my friend for whom I bought it.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|Ok first of all I've been waiting for this movie since 2012. When I saw the trailer I was so excited I love horror and gore. I know that it's a remake and I wanted to see the original which is a fun cult classic. This movie was so good I wanted to see it a second time but didn't. Thank goodness it's coming early.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I love Coldplay and this CD doesn't disappoint. &#34;Fix You&#34; is one of the songs I listen to over and over again. I love to listen to Coldplay alone so I can immerse myself in the sound and lyrics.
B000IDGBWU|3.0|Girl meets boy theme.  Nothing new.  Back in the day when abortions were illegal, the movie reflects upon the morals and virtues of the times.  It's ok, but nothing to write home about.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I started with the sample and found myself drawn into the life of the main character, which the author presents from her earliest years all the way till her 90's. I'm almost tempted to say &#34;epic&#34; in it's span, because of the characters across generations, but it's not presumptuous in that sort of way. It's about the life of one person, and the intersection of that life with many others. I would highly recommend this book to anyone as well who enjoys losing themselves in an almost forgotten time and place.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|I just fell in love with this movie! I haven't read the book yet..guess I should have done that first!!  it made me cry but in a good way :)
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|A very eclectic album to fit all my summer moods. It's been in constant rotation since I bought it and will remain so until I can't stand it anymore.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like this game because there are more than one armor and me and my friend's like it to so l it's a good iron man 3 game for people  that like iron man I hope you and your friends like this game to
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I read some one star reviews and they all say they didn't like how he was trying to change a little. It's my first time becoming a fan and so I decided to listen to his older songs and they were great too. I don't see why people hate it so badly, the songs has a classical feeling to it while trying to tell you how they feel.
0783229526|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. This was a good price. It came in a sealed package and was not scratched or damaged. The disc plays well, the picture is clear and the sound quality is good.
B00C8985DU|5.0|I have been waiting a while for this .Well worth the wait.Linda pictures amazing !What a great couple!What an amazing tour to be relived again &again!Cant wait to see him in millwaukee in july!
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|It was easy to get involved with this movie because the leading characters were all favorites from our childhood.  As with any good movie good triumpts over evil with a lot of action along  the way.
B00BZOD63S|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie. Very suspenseful, it kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Way too much medical detail and then it ends very abruptly. Too many different scenarios going at same time and that was distracting.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is the funniest book that I have read in a long time.  The author's writing style is fantastic.  Once I started reading, I couldn't stop.  It's written from a male's point of view and it's just the perfect combination of everything - curse words, sex, love, humor.  I laughed out loud so many times that I almost thought about letting my husband read it...almost...but couldn't relinquish my kindle.  You will fall in love with Drew.  I can't wait for more from this author!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|very good movie, effects and content make it worth it in this format, almost like going to the movies, excellent
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is so much fun and very addictive. Great way to pass the time. It's very fast paced but don't worry, the game teaches you how to do the moves before you start and you'll get the hang of it. I recommend this app.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|very good movie, effects and content make it worth it in this format, almost like going to the movies, excellent
0440237688|5.0|Book Cover - I really liked this book cover and found it to be appropriate for the story line. *<br /><br />Story - I loved this story. The more I read the more I wanted to read. I honestly don't think that there was a slow period in this entire book. *<br /><br />Author - I loved reading the work of Lois Lowry and defiantly want to read more from her. *<br /><br />Religious Factor - There really wasn't a boldness of this category in this book however there was one point in the book that I could easily have seen them trying to do a Narnia case where the Lion is suppose to represent God but in this case it was The Giver instead of the lion. So because it kinda left it open to let me form my own opinion on that I gave it a star. *<br /><br />Cleanliness - There was no fowl language used in this book. *<br /><br />Overall Review: I loved this book and think that everybody should read it at least once. I was supper excited to find out that there are other book like this one by this author and I will defiantly be reading those when I can get my hands on them. This book was a page turner for me that I just really didn't want to put down and was always looking forward to where the story would take me next. Great Work!
B005LAIGPU|5.0|very good movie, effects and content make it worth it in this format, almost like going to the movies, excelent
193700788X|4.0|a good way to end the series, and even though it's the last, it's left open for lots of things to happen
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I can honestly say that I have not been this excited in a long, long time. I was sitting straight on my own couch  (in my own home!) with unbelievable visual experiences the whole way. Life of Pi was more than I anticipated. You will not be disappointed!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this app for my 10 yr old daughter who LOVES horses and she keeps talking about how much she loves it! Very cool app and she can come and go from it frequently which is very convienent with our busy schedules!
B0006J28KU|5.0|This a good movie, Al pacino and De Niro fantastic actors, movie accion drama the best in this genero. OK
B00AW57L96|5.0|Lianne Moriarty's new novel begins with a bit of Greek Mythology, and the story of poor Pandora who's been given a bad rap and turned into a sorry metaphor over time, especially considering \\"nobody said a word about not opening it!\\"<br /><br />It's an apt metaphor, indeed. The unsuspecting and fair Pandora who didn't know what she was getting herself into when she innocently opened a jar and unleashed horrors onto the world. Cut to modern-day Sydney and Cecilia Fitzpatrick is wrestling with her conscience about opening a letter her husband never thought she'd find, to be opened only in the event of his death (which is a problem, since he's still very much alive and healthy). Cecilia is an upstanding citizen and beyond-reproach mum at St. Angela's primary school, where her three daughters are currently attending. Cecilia is a good Catholic, a superb Tupperware saleswoman and loving wife to equally upstanding John-Paul. But this letter is nagging at her - especially when John-Paul is thrown into a fit over it, and her daughters start sharing their own concerns about dad's behaviour. . .<br /><br />In Melbourne, Tess O'Leary has just had a veritable Pandora's Box blown up in her face, when her husband Will and beloved cousin (more like sister), Felicity, announce their pious love and declare that they'd very much like to start a relationship . . . Tess is shaken to her core, and fuelled with hate. Herself a socially awkward by-product of divorce, and with her young son Liam to consider, she decides to leave her husband and cousin to their debauchery in the hopes they come to their senses - she and Liam leave for Sydney, to stay with her ailing mother and escape the heartache. But while trying to escape the deluge, Tess runs into an old flame and PE teacher at St. Angela's where she's just enrolled Liam. Connor Whitby was a blip on Tess's romantic past, but seeing him again (and aged into a right spunk!) pulls a passion out of Tess that surprises her as much as Will and Felicity's betrayal.<br /><br />And then there's Rachel Crowley, who is hoping to pry open an ages-old Pandora secret. Rachel works administration at St. Angela's; she is a besotted grandmother to Jacob and widowed wife who is terrified when her son, Rob, and his wife announce they'll be packing their bags and living in New York for two years. Rachel is also the mother of Janie Crowley - the girl who was famously murdered in 1984, strangled to death and her body left in the local park with rosary beads the only clue to her murder. To this day, the police have no real suspects - though Rachel personally believes Connor Whitby to have `lies in his eyes', as the last person to have seen her daughter alive . . .<br /><br />While there are certainly plenty of Pandora-esque tragedies and catastrophes flying around this book, Moriarty plays out a few more metaphors than just the Greek. There's a biblical `eye for an eye' element running throughout, as these three women test their convictions and heartaches, measure their anger against forgiveness and seek very different retributions against the backdrop of St. Angela's primary school. Then there's also the history of the Berlin Wall running concurrently - as Cecilia's daughter is obsessed with history and has turned her mind to the Cold War, escape artists and the momentous historical collapse of the wall. The Berlin Wall being a metaphor for sealing in and keeping out . . . but also, perhaps, the inevitability of collapse - that secrets very rarely remain kept forever, and walls once put up are bound to come crashing down.<br /><br />I adored this book. I previously read and loved Moriarty's 'The Hypnotist's Love Story' and vowed to read whatever she came up with next - though I have no idea why I waited so long (a full month!) to read `The Husband's Secret'. This book hooked me in the first chapter, and by the fourth I was inwardly snarling at anything that kept my away from reading more, more, more (very annoying whilereading on the train and making my destination - I did consider just doing a continuous loop until I got to the end of the book).<br /><br />There's a big `what if?', `Sliding Doors' element to this book. Rachel blames herself for running seven minutes late on Janie's last day - seven minutes that might have meant she'd been waiting for her mum instead of walking home through the park. Tess starts thinking what could have been when she runs into Connor Whitby after so many years, and so much recent heartbreak. And Cecilia blames the Berlin Wall (and foraging in the attic for a souvenir piece) for her uncovering her husband's letter, and eventually his secret. . . Moriarty weaves this in beautifully to the book, and very occasionally an omniscient narrator reveals what was lost and gained from the small variants of life.<br /><br />I suppose `The Husband's Secret' could be said to be all about wives and mothers, as the three main characters very much are. But Moriarty also examines her protagonists as women, which I found really interesting. It was little things - Janie Crowley vulnerable as she walked through the park, Tess driving late one night and noticing a man walking home (musing that a woman would never think to do that). It was Cecilia raising her daughters.<br /><br />And while this is a novel about marriages, Moriarty swerves away from the usual line of `nobody really knows what goes on in a marriage apart from the people involved'. . . instead, she explores the possibility that even then, those involved in the marriage don't know themselves at all.<br /><br />I would say this is also a book about anger and morals and how those two are sometimes intertwined, but more often at loggerheads. And Moriarty captured anger so well that I could taste the metallic indignation, like blood, on the tip of my tongue in some paragraphs.<br /><br />This is a superb novel that, upon finishing, I instantly wanted to pass on to someone else to read so I could talk about it with them. I think these characters are going to stay with me for a good long while, and I don't think I'll ever really be settled or comfortable with the decisions they made throughout this book (I'll always think \\"what if?\\"). I'll never again make the mistake of waiting one whole month to read a Liane Moriarty novel.reading on the train and making my destination - I did consider just doing a continuous loop until I got to the end of the book).<br /><br />There's a big `what if?', `Sliding Doors' element to this book.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|I found this book depressing, like I had a cloud hanging over my head the whole time.  I was thinking it was because I have a son who is this exact age and maybe it hit to close to home.  I didn't feel there was enough depth to the book.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It works great on my Note and my Droid before that.  Have tried the stock app and others but keep returning to this one.
B000BBOV8U|3.0|I love Bryan Adams and bought this CD because of the track list, but I agree with That Girl, in the fact that this album was over produced.<br />They re-recorded all of the songs and took out all of the emotion that was on the original recordings.<br />It's still Bryan, just without any emotion. blah :-(<br /><br />He is not the first to do it. I have other artists G-Hits that did the same thing.<br />It always seems to be the CDs that have the most complete body of work.
B003ZJ70W4|1.0|I loved the tv series, but this movie is downright offensive. Do yourself a favor and save 2 hours of your life and avoid this movie!
1577314808|4.0|A friend told me this book changed her whole way of thinking. I am still reading it. I wouldn't say it is going to have such a profound impact on me but it does give pause to stop, think and see things from a different set of eyes.
B009NQXXZ6|5.0|This may be my all-time favorite movie!  When it first came out I was so in love with Kris Kristofferson!  I watched it again and I still feel the same way - it's my favorite movie!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Very disconcerting never knowing when one story would stop and another begin. I really don't like watching movies where you have to bear with the plot or plots (in this case). I am reasonably intelligent but waiting for the light at the end of the tunnel is just boring!
B00AZF13KG|1.0|I bought this movie because the reviews were good and it was cheap!  My husband and I both thought it was awful.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|If you like White Collar, you'll like Suits. The quick banter is the best part with sharp acting that raises the bar for cable t.v.

B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|The game is amazing for a android and ios app very detailed and very similar to team fortress just needs more maps
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This show has some really interesting characters. There is a main team and they are the stars, like any of these cookie cutter shows but they keep bringing in the lime light poachers to switch it up. I think it hits a good balance for me, the drama is a notch below the usual end of the world neurotic level that is so popular and the plots always involve next step thinking. You can tell a great show in my mind if you can walk away from the TV to check the pot on the cooker and stay engaged just listening to the dialogue.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Nice to watch a movie that is enjoyable and makes you think. I haven't seen one like this in a long time.

B00114RKT8|5.0|I thought I knew the story well but had to correct some of my details.<br />The movie is mildly confusing in the beginning but ends very well so don't give up as it gets better the longer it runs. It is tragedy that so few have any knowledge of Wilberforce who ended the slave trade in Britain.
6302212529|5.0|I just love the movie. I had the movie on VHS . I'm now replacing it with DVD. My grand kids just love it
B00992CF6W|1.0|My son bought this app for his Kindle.<br /><br />Graphics are horrible. No online game play even though they say it is allowed. Within 5 minutes we were wanting a refund.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|THIS WAS A MOST INTERESTING MOVIE.  THE YOUNG PI DID A GREAT JOB AND I HOPE HE GOES ON TO BE A FAMOUS ACTOR!!!  THE OCEAN SCENES WERE WONDERFUL!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I resided in England for several years and it brings back many memories. Believe it or not, it is still going on. I also like it because it has limited bad language, although it has adult themes, it is very true to life.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Good application. Goes straight to Facebook page and posts in real time.  Does not take long to upload and is user friendly.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This is a good app for the kindle fire. I enjoy practicing on the kindle whenever I have free time. A good app for beginners and advanced players.
0545265355|5.0|I already read these books but had borrowed them from a friend. Reading them again and shipping and condition of the books were perfect

B00AFEY354|5.0|One of the best stories about a teen with a troubled and sad history that makes you laugh and then want to cry for him.  Have already recommended this book to several friends and highly recommend the movie which holds true to the book.
B004FWPK8G|5.0|Love this movie,  really makes you laugh and life has enough drama so I love a good comedy.  Goldie was great in this!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard of the Hunger Games in title but had no idea what it was about.  I was hooked about 100 pages in.  Luckily I picked it up at the beginning of a few days off of work and had a chance to read the whole series before I got back to &#34;real life&#34;.  It was an easy, interesting, fun read.  Recommend it to anyone.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Considering the time when this movie was made, the ideas and effects are very impressive.  A great cast, only hindered by the lack of women.  A thought-provoking movie.  Highly enjoyable.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|I really liked this movie, it was fast paced, full of action, had me glued to the TV, but . . . if the sheriff came from narcotics in Los Angeles and is now in Arizona, why does he have an accent?  That question grated on me throughout the entire movie.  On a personal note, how does the former governator of California still have an accent after living in the United States for decades?  Mind boggling - it truly is.<br /><br />If you like action movies, try this one out.  It's not as good as Fast and Furious 6, but it has some amazing new stunts like FF6.  And if you like cars, that Corvette is SWEET!!!
B000O14VAU|1.0|I cannot connect with any of the characters in the movie. They are all concerned with obliterating each other. So I left then to it and stopped watching.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|What a cool game to have. My son can't of enough of this game. You have to build the suite, test it, add the specks, and well, create Iron Man in your own image. He plays the game quite a bit. I recommend this game to anyone that really enjoys Ironman (or has kids that do) and enjoys building and experimenting with mechanical technology.
B00CRYO7BU|5.0|I watched Season 5 in all of one week. It was that good! And now that it's over, I find myself at a loss. That cliffhanger was wicked - good thing we only have to wait a few months. Castle is charming and fun - especially for us sci-fi lovers.. all those little slip ins of sci-fi messages was fun. Of course, loved the Johnathan Frakes directed episodes.<br />There's enough drama, enough comedy, enough suspense, and enough mystery to keep driving this story forward.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|This is a cool App. You can position yourself with the Kindle anywhere and it positions the stars on the Kindle for you. My son has a telescope and can look at the stars and moon. He loves the app. I am glad we downloaded it as it is useful.

B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Not sure why we never saw this at the theater, but definitely worth your time. We will also recommend this movie to friends and family.
B00ARIO7PO|3.0|This is an electronic music REMIX of many of Mike Oldfield's classics, done by his young protege, York. The album is decent enough to buy, but don't expect to hear pure classics..<br />All music was heavily mixed and produced to a degree that its hard to tell what the original sounded like.

B00B2QG3K2|2.0|I've been hooked on Paramore since 2007, when [[ASIN:B000PTYPAC Riot]] broke them into the mainstream. They matured slightly but maintained a pretty similar pop/punk/happy rock sound on [[ASIN:B002FRNCG0 Brand New Eyes]], another successful album. Since then they've seen lineup changes and taken things in quite a different direction. I certainly hope they won't go further down this road, and I'll try to elaborate why in my review.<br /><br />\\"Fast In My Car\\" opens the album up, and already the band is on half steam. They throw on some poorly concocted riffs and Hayley makes it through the song, but there is absolutely nothing about it that stands out as interesting or memorable. The first single \\"Now\\" follows, while this one has grown on me, it sounds kind of like they recorded their instruments on seperate continents and threw it all together later. The song is sort of shambling indie rock, only the vocals keep it from toppling over. \\"Grow Up\\" is another song about someone (a guy who hurt you, Hayley?) who will not grow up, but Paramore are certainly growing up and moving on in the world, look at them go! They've nagged this theme to death on [[ASIN:B002FRNCG0 Brand New Eyes]] already (but at least back then it was set to good music). \\"Daydreaming\\" is another song sure to grind your gears, it's more like musical nagging than any melodic, awesome kind of rock. I'll sum up every last interlude on the album with my thoughts on the first, \\"Moving On\\"; it's a pointless, distracting, pretentious, wafty piece of filler with Hayley strumming a ukulele and trying to sound incredibly profound. If you have to pack the album with this musical bubble wrap, at least make it a little different - add some different instruments, lead into a song, anything at all. \\"Ain't It Fun\\" sounds like a rejected Michael Jackson song - a kind of Caribbean wedding muzak piece. It should pick up and go somewhere, but it doesn't. \\"Part II\\" is the spiritual successor to a far better song - \\"Let The Flames Begin\\". They prod at the wound only to remind us they were once a great band, by destroying their own music, it only adds insult to injury. It unfortunately sounds like a very half-butted indie rock version, and I say that very sincerely - they've sucked out every single part of it that was good, strong and catchy and replaced it with trudging drum machines and meaningless strumming on guitar strings. \\"Last Hope\\" is another interlude with drums and that same excuse for guitar work again, it's not a song, don't be fooled. Then, at last, comes the highlight of the album. \\"Still Into You\\" is an absolutely amazing song. It's everything this album should have been and more. It's got energy, it's got emotion, it's got joy, power and speed, and they actually play guitar and drums on the track! It's infectious, rocky, poppy, it's everything good and right about Paramore. It's the only solid reason to listen to the album whatsoever, and a single that will live on long after the album collects dust in bargain bins all over the world. \\"Anklebiters\\" follows it, and it's Paramore by the numbers. It's supposed to be fun and infectious but it just comes off as a little obnoxious. Then there's a track called \\"Proof\\", which I had forgotten about. That says pretty much everything about that track. It's followed by three interludes. \\"Be Alone\\" is more indie rock with an incredibly awkward melody that shambles around like a drunken embarrassment. The album closes with \\"Future\\", which is three minutes of interlude and four minutes of noise. The end.<br /><br />I have nothing against Paramore, but if this is the direction they'll continue to pursue, I won't be listening to them for much longer. Hopefully they will come to their senses and realize that rock music can both be fun and go in new directions - they succeeded wonderfully with \\"Still Into You\\", a song that should be played at weddings, parties and everywhere with sunlight. To summarize, 1.9 stars for \\"Still Into You\\", 0.1 stars for \\"Fast In My Car\\" and \\"Now\\". Use the rest as a coaster for a good beverage while you're listening to \\"Still Into You\\". That song rocks.1 stars for \\"Fast In My Car\\" and \\"Now\\". Use the rest as a coaster for a good beverage while you're listening to \\"Still Into You\\". That song rocks.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  Three ways to play plus the bonus game. The achievements to unlock were fun too. Had to pay 2.49 half way through but I think I got my moneys worth playing it.
B00BAB6CNC|3.0|I was quite disappointed with [[ASIN:B008YZXYY2 Part 1]], but having listened through them back to back, it's become very clear why. The heavier, darker part is all on  this second half of the story, and it blends the two together beautifully into one seamless story. While both pieces are quite flawed, combining them into one opens up a grander and much more fulfilling experience.<br /><br />\\"Red City\\" dares to open softly with Corey speaking his tale, and then it becomes a nail-grinding hard rock sledge. It shows a lot of promise.<br />\\"Black John\\" again recalls the sound of the [[ASIN:B00006FYG0 self titled debut]], but in a very good way. It's a solid song. Not soaring but quite decent.<br />\\"Sadist\\" is as close as we come to a ballad. I could do without it.<br />\\"Peckinpah\\" is also very classic heavy metal stuff. Almost old school thrash/alternative metal. Decent.<br />\\"Stalemate\\" has one of those big old choruses but it doesn't mesh perfectly with the heavier part.<br />\\"Gravesend\\" maintaintains that same vibe - classic, hard, almost 80's like metal.<br />\\"'82\\" kicks it into high gear with a great riff. I'm a sucker for melody and this has plenty of it.<br />\\"The Uncanny Valley\\" again takes you right back in time, it's by no means an incredible song but it does alright.<br />\\"Blue Smoke\\" is probably the best and most evocative interlude the band has ever done. I'm sure you'll imagine all sorts of images to these two powerful minutes.<br />\\"Do Me A Favor\\" is a very different, almost joyful, sound for the band. I found it very awkward at first, but it's dug itself like a tick into my head and I can't stop whistling or singing the chorus, so I have to proclaim it a victory. It's certainly Corey's best vocal moment on the album.<br />\\"The Conflagration\\" is an excellent song that brings the entire story full circle. The piano and Taylor's vocals merge beautifully with the rest of the band, and the song jumps out and grabs you, almost like some crazy inspirational 80's power ballad, but in the best way possible.<br />\\"The House Of Gold And Bones\\" is the sendoff. And quite a sendoff it is! Just pure mallet-to-the-wall metal, huge and heavy from the very beginning.<br /><br />It's hard to set my finger on \\"House of Gold and Bones\\". The sound overall is very close to the [[ASIN:B00006FYG0 self titled album]] to my ears, and as sappy and honey-drenched as it may be, I much prefer [[ASIN:B003UNNAYW Audio Secrecy]]. But it's an ambitious project, a meaningful story and an album (singular) that is sure to grow on me in years to come. While I wouldn't put it up there with my favourites, as a whole I declare it worthy of the Stone Sour catalogue. Do yourself a favor and listen to all 23 tracks of the story in order and at the same time, if you play close attention it will open up beyond the scope of your average album.'s power ballad, but in the best way possible.<br />\\"The House Of Gold And Bones\\" is the sendoff.

B000DWMYQ8|5.0|Got this for my daughter. She went to friends house and fell in love with the movie. Could not find it at any of the local stores. But like always Amazon came through. Great price and fast shipping. As soon as we got it in she had it in the DVD player. If you've never seen it, must have for kids.

B000JO9JHW|5.0|Kept me riveted, couldn't wait for the next episode, loved the writing and acting. Can't wait to watch the next season.
B009GX69RK|5.0|If you're looking for deep thoughts look elsewhere but if you want a funny cast and lighthearted entertainment then u need to see this show. The cast knows why you're watching and never tries to make it anything its not. Absolutely worth a look!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This copy of the new DVD of &#34;Les Miz&#34; is such a delight.  The movie makes us all SING, and want to be a decent person like Jean Valjean and live a redeemed life.  If you want to be moved and slip back into a wonderful story, you may want to be sure to own this for your home library!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I chose this rating because it is a great app. You can chat with with people without having to know their number! Thumbs up! (:
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Watched Seasons 1-3 at no additional cost  on Amazon Prime and purchased season 4. Very enjoyable TV with solid acting and a varied and interesting script. Looking forward to season 5.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Very well done.  Movie contained drama, comedy, romance, etc.  All were done well.  The writers placed an interesting dynamic to the concept of lost love and the actors expressed to relative emotions very well.
B0094K20FK|4.0|we watched this before we saw the new (2013) star trek(into the darkness)<br />and it made the new one more enjoyable.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel and cast are uniformly excellent in this drama about an alcoholic pilot who saves his aircraft and his passengers from certain death while totally blitzed.  His academy award nomination was well earned.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This is an excellent movie with just the right amount of drama and suspense, along with romance and a great climax .
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This is an outstanding movie.  I agree with a previous reviewer that Gene Roddenberry would be proud.  Action, adventure, and fun!  If I get a chance to see it again in the theater, I will, and I definitely will own it when it comes out.  I just have to say that I am SO GLAD that JJ Abrams had the actors all be true to the way the original characters were played--it is truly believable that these are the same characters from the original series caught up in a different time line.  They do such a great and believable job--it's truly awesome!
B001HN6EF4|5.0|I bought them because I thought they are way more durable than the paper ones.  Also they are ideal for playing in the pool :)
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This movie is superb. One should use caution when viewing with children, the accurate portrayal of events during the Holocaust can be disturbing.
B008476HBM|5.0|Language of Jane Austin transported me to another time where self expression was an art form compared to our expressions of today. I found myself resisting the style of writing, feeling it was getting in the way of the story. Then, as I settled into the nuances I realized the writing played an equal role to our beloved characters and locations.<br />A valuable experience worth the efforts.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I'll watch it on occasion mainly because it's part of the story line. Some of it is repetitive. Almost too long. The dwarves are quite amusing and worth watching.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I've always seen this book around, but never thought to buy it till recently. I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner. If you love fantasy adventure story's that don't end quick. This series may be for you.
B00B69UQJY|2.0|I am a hardcore classical DM fan and this album in my opinion does them no justice. But I am looking forward to their concert in September. Hopefully they'll play some of their older songs.
B000SNW0HA|4.0|Their latest album Random Access Memories has been getting rave reviews but this is the album that launched the career of the French electronic duo known as Daft Punk.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This is a great second book of the series. I really enjoyed this book and I can't wait for the next one. I live this series and I would recommend it highly to anyone who loves to read and loves action, romance, and suspense.
B003TGUSHM|5.0|Very interesting and engaging. I was never bored and the it keeps me wanting more! I truly enjoy watching it. Can't wait to start on Season 2!
B0000CF35F|5.0|Record sounds great.<br />Gatefold is very good.<br />Classic album reissue is nice.<br />I recommend this LP to all fans of AC/DC.
B0091WFNEG|5.0|Sure, it mistakenly adheres to the lost cause interpretation of the war and the battle.  Sure, it mistakenly adheres to the interpetation that Lee's battle plan of the 3rd was a huge mistake.  Sure, it mistakenly reduces the Union high command to, essentially, Hancock, Buford and a bunch of slugs. Sure it glosses over the very solid work of George Meade while glossing over the slovenly adminstrative and communication work of Bob Lee.  However, since these are all limitations present in the source material The Killer Angels, they may be forgiven.  The reason for the forgiveness is because of the absolutelly outstanding presentation of the general sequence of the days leading into and of the battle itself as well as some totally outstanding performances.  Most notable are Berenger as Longstreet, Lang as Pickett and to a lesser extent Sheen as Lee.
B001FES0IE|5.0|Record sounds great.<br />Gatefold is very good.<br />Classic album reissue is nice.<br />I recommend this LP to all fans of Queen.
B005PK56TA|5.0|very intriguing. good writing and character development make it a must watch for adults. Has a dark premise but that's what is interesting. would think sci-fi people would enjoy it.
B001G9FFIQ|5.0|Record sounds great.<br />Gatefold is very good.<br />Classic album reissue is nice.<br />I recommend this LP to all fans of Metallica.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The hardest part about reading this trilogy is having to wait for the third book to come out! I may have to read the first two again before the third book comes out.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Blu-Ray sounds great.<br />Gatefold is very good.<br />This Concert is nice.<br />I recommend this Blu-Ray to all fans of Steven Wilson
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great app I encourage you to purchase it. I have had the app on my iPhone but I love it even more on the Kindle fire. I encourage you to purchase this app.
B000002OX5|5.0|Remaster sounds great.<br />Gatefold is very good.<br />Classic album reissue is nice.<br />I recommend this LP to all fans of The Who.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Loooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />That is pretty much it for me.  I could not get into the story because there was no single story to get into, just a bunch of short ones with a very thin thread at the end.
B001UJIMM8|4.0|Record sounds great.<br />Gatefold is very good.<br />Classic album reissue is nice.<br />I recommend this LP to all fans of Megadeth.
B00CDCIQX6|1.0|This movie takes off the wall spins, which yes, eventually come together at the end.  But most of the movie is spent waiting to know what's going on.  Not my style of movie.  Too bad, Tom Hanks is one of my favorites.
B000002OX3|4.0|Remaster sounds great.<br />Gatefold is very good.<br />Classic album reissue is nice.<br />I recommend this LP to all fans of The Who.
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|Picture quality superb, value pack that can have digital copy for portable viewing plus extra bd for special features.<br />Movie itself is fun.
B003WG3218|4.0|Record sounds great.<br />Gatefold is very good.<br />Classic album reissue is nice.<br />I recommend this LP to all fans of Thin Lizzy.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|I was moved by the story  and Audrey Hepurn's performance. A good lesson can be learned from this portrayal of obedence, poverty and silence. It takes a remarkable person to keep these vows and remain faithful to them and God.
B0042EJD5I|5.0|Record sounds great.<br />Gatefold is very good.<br />Classic album reissue is nice.<br />I recommend this LP to all fans of King Crimson.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|Let's get this out of the way immediately:<br /><br />-Layne Staley is dead.<br />-He's not coming back.<br /><br />Good. Can we proceed? Because regardless of whether we want to complain and cry that \\"this isn't REAL Alice in Chains\\" or \\"this is a far cry from their previous stuff,\\" the fact remains that \\"Dirt\\" came out over 20 years ago, their former lead singer died over a decade ago, and the band has moved on...regardless of whether \\"fans\\" want them to or not. Is it \\"Dirt?\\" No. That's an obvious answer; it's also a dumb comparison because there's no reason we should be comparing it to that album.<br /><br />So let's get to \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\": it's good. If you liked \\"Black Gives Way to Blue,\\" you'll probably like this. And it should also be noted: both TDPDH and BGWTB are far more stylistically similar to AiC's self-titled album than to \\"Dirt\\" or \\"Facelift.\\" I suppose one way to look at TDPDH is as \\"adult grunge,\\" which makes sense: if you discovered AiC as an early teen, you're probably in your mid-to-late 30s. So, it's grunge for adults, not for raging, angsty teens.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable listen. I'm not going to rate every single song--more power to those that want to do that, but that's not my thing. I'll simply say that if you're willing to allow AiC to grow, get older, and still rock...you'll probably enjoy the album. Is it a classic? No. But is it good? Heck, yeah.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|Record sounds great.<br />Gatefold is great, includes a book with photographs.<br />Classic album reissue is nice.<br />I recommend this LP to all fans of Jimi Hendrix.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy the complexity of this game, but some of the items are just too much. I am playing free and don't like to spend any real money,  but it seems impossible to ever earn enough moneyy/diamonds to complete the games
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is my first attempt to play online bingo.  I picked the right game, BUT.... it can be addictive !!  Not really, but I do enjoy this one!
B000IDEORY|5.0|I have seen this movie so many times and never get tired of it.  Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze are great. The movie is funny, romantic and entertaining.
B004I744AS|5.0|I enjoy the new dictionary I downloaded this week. This is so much easier to use than my old standby book that my Mother gave me years ago. She would've enjoyed this too! What a great tool to have at my finger tips. Thank you Amazon
B002UBRFDC|5.0|A sensational semi-historical novel, beautifully written,  Could not put it down. Have read it many times and never get tired of the story.
B008Y73940|4.0|kept moving and suspense going.  Matt M very good in this role.  worth watching alone of with family and friends
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Tom Baker was my favorite, but these Doctor and Amy adventures are really good too.  I'm actually re-watching these with my son now that he has become a Doctor Who fan.
B003FCMAS0|5.0|This movie is gorgeous and keeps you fully entertained.  The actors were wonderful in creating the right fiction.  This moviewould be fantastic in 3-D.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Watched all of season 1 in two days. Very addictive show.  Highly entertaining,  great music and dancing.  For anyone who loves musical theatre,  I think you'll appreciate th show.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Every time I am listening this CD I like it more and more, finding more details in beautiful compositions. I cannot stop listening, especially \\"Above and Beyond\\".  With ages this group is better and better, like very good and unique vine. You can tell, the super group is playing, super professional. Per my view, the music is  interesting mixture of Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, ELP and little bit of Yes.<br />I wish, that Steve Morse and Don Airey have longer solo passages on guitar and organ.<br />The extra DVD is just interview of band and 3 audio versions of the songs. I thought this DVD included one or two videos from the concert or recording studio.
1250039037|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because I read once in a life time.  I recommend this book to everyone. Happy I read it.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie and the actors and actresses were fantastic.  We're pleased to add this to our media library.
B005OYKHSM|5.0|I thought the F&F franchise was for guys who drink NOS, drown themselves in AXE body spray, and put Type R badges on whatever car they happen to be driving.  I was also turned off by the trailers - as far as I knew, these movies were just two-hour long rap videos with rice boys and ghetto booties.<br /><br />I was laid up sick and happened to catch &#34;Fast & Furious&#34; on TV.  I was hooked from the tanker scene and it went from there.<br /><br />Fast Five is even bigger.  It continues the franchise's utter contempt for Sir Isaac Newton and you get to see cars doing impossible things like dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio de Janeiro and people jumping from great heights without so much as sprained ankles.<br /><br />Comic relief comes from Leo and Santos.  Their near-constant bilingual bickering is funny to listen to and watch.  The back-and-forths between Tej and Roman aren't as funny but at least stay firmly planted in English.<br /><br />There's tons of action and a party wouldn't be a party without Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson playing an intense and musclebound lawman.  You can imagine his character's hobbies would include beating people up and finding ways to make handcuffs more uncomfortable.  The Rock is just likeable.  He could be shown punching nuns and little kids and you'd cheer.<br /><br />Poor Brian.  He's proven his worth and loyalty and even after changing hemispheres and being Mia's boyfriend he still has to put up with being called &#34;buster.&#34;<br /><br />I do have some questions though.<br /><br />1. How did Dom get his Charger all the way to Rio?<br />2. What would Tej have done had his remote control camera car landed upside down?<br />3. Where were all those favela tough guys when Zizi and his crew were shooting the place up?<br />4. What if the roulette ball didn't land on green?<br /><br />The end sequence is fun because everyone has seemingly forgotten the millions of dollars of damage done, the scores of people either killed or injured, and the serious diplomatic issues that no doubt sprang up between the United States and Brazil.<br /><br />Great movie.  I watch it almost weekly.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|At first, I wasn't going to write  a review of this. My Sister's Keeper deals with a controversial issue and is very confusing. However, I figured that if I can write &#34;mean&#34; book reviews and not care if people hate it, I can write a book review about this book.<br /><br />Anna Fitzgerald is a thirteen year old girl that has had blood transfusions, shots, and surgeries. It is not Anna that is sick though, but her older sister, Kate. The medical procedures were to help Kate live a little longer. In fact, the reason Anna was born was to be Kate's donor. One day, she gets pushed too far. Her parents are asking her to give up a kidney for Kate. Anna gets a lawyer to sue her parents for medical emancipation.<br /><br />There are valid arguments of why Anna should donate her blood and why she shouldn't. Both make you think a lot. Sometimes, you might hate Anna for being selfish, but other times, you'd cheer her on. Either way, this book makes you think a lot.<br /><br />The characters of My Sister's Keeper were well developed. They all had their own issues they needed to deal with.<br /><br />There was a main plot of this book, which was Anna suing her parents, but there were other subplots, unlike in many other books.<br /><br />Campbell Alexander, the lawyer of Anna, was very fun to read. He has a service dog, and he tells many people different explanations of why he has the dog. Over the course of the book, he changes from an uncaring jerk to a caring one.<br /><br />I both hated and admired Sara Fitzgerald. She did everything she could to save one child, but what about the others?<br /><br />I really enjoyed the multiple point of views in this book.<br /><br />When I started reading, I was expecting a serious book. I read what I thought I would read, but there were also a couple of jokes in there, which I did not expect. It didn't take away the seriousness of the book but actually lightened it a little bit.<br /><br />And the ending. I know most reviews talk about the ending, but it was very unexpected. Well, it was unexpected to everyone except for me because my friend ruined it for me. I'm looking at you, Tiny Korean.<br /><br />If you read this book, and I really recommend you do, you really have to keep an open mind. If you don't you're probably going to hate it a lot. And, if you didn't understand the hints in this review, this is not a quick and light read. You're going to sit and think of what you might have done in their situation and change your mind a lot.<br /><br />I am definitely going to read Picoult's other books. Her writing style is very interesting and is hard to pull off, but she does.<br /><br />Read this is you want a compelling book. However, do not read it out in public. You'll probably start crying, and that's not embarrassing at all.<br /><br />And now, some of my favorite quotes from this book. I think I'll start doing this in reviews.<br /><br />“You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not.”<br /><br />“Let me tell you this: if you meet a loner, no matter what they tell you, it's not because they enjoy solitude. It's because they have tried to blend into the world before, and people continue to disappoint them.”<br /><br />“Maybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it.”<br /><br />“The bottom line is that we never fall for the people we're supposed to.”<br /><br />“It is the things you cannot see coming that are strong enough to kill you.”
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a very addictive game, and alot of fun... love playing and figuring it out, New moves and such :)
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Very engaging portrayal of the well loved story - sympathetic portayals of the characters, making for an enjoyable viewing experience. Made you want to watch all the episodes at once...
B0035HKWM6|5.0|My kids thought the movie was awesome, Jim Carrey is fabulous! Cameron Diaz's debut was excellent,hilarious movie a definite must!
B0065CCM76|5.0|He is still a SUPER entertainer.... this album brings back many, many great memories....It is also a perfect replicae of how he still sounds in his concerts!!!
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Our family really enjoyed this movie.  Great message, beautiful surfing scenes, interesting story line.  Especially interesting because it is based on a true story.  Keep making more like this.  There aren't nearly enough family movies being made.  Thank you, Gerard Butler!
B003UBTX7C|4.0|I have never read any of David Baldacci's books, but that will change with the completion of Hell's Corner.  I found it to be very<br />intriguing and suspenseful.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Chris, I'm not typically one to respond to survey requests - but in this case I can't contain myself.  My job situation is tenuous and it has led me to work through the reason that I'm on this earth.  I've been going through a 10 week process with Kary Oberbrunner and his book called The Deeper Path.  He's the one that told me about your book.  Now it's my turn to write a book and deliver a message of hope.  It will be based on my blog.  http://brianupdate.wordpress.com/2011/09/28/what-happened/
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I thought this book may be a daunting task to get through, but I have never read another book that I have highlighted passages as much as this one. Victor Hugo understood humanity and paints a story that is hard to put down.
B008N1V11U|4.0|My 13 year old son got this game and was hooked from the beginning. He likes the graphics and the action. The level of violence is not too bad, no blood and gore that I have seen. He was a big fan of the movie and the game just reinforces that. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love the amazon cloud player and mp3 app. I am able to listen to all my Amazon bought music on my apple devices and yet my son can down load and save his songs onto his android device.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|One of my new favorite shows. Smart, psychological and horrific. Sometimes a little too gratuitous for TV. Like watching a good horror movie every week. Love Mads Mikkelsen as cannibal Hannibal and Hugh Dancy as the glazed over Will Graham. Great cast of A actors, production and writing. But not sure how long they can play out the series since we already know Hannibal's fate from Silence of the Lambs. Well hellloooo Clarice.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love and have to have my Amazon mobile app. If I could get this app on my desktop computer I would.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.  Had no idea that it was in the genre of world cataclysm events and time travel.  Moves fast and keeps you guessing, worth watching more than once.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I use it for my shopping lists every week! I love that the note auto saves! This is a great app!
B001F7MSG6|5.0|I loved the media angle on HellBoy, the love interests of HellBoy and Abe, the new villains, the new unstoppable world threat.<br />And the ending that provides the opening for HellBoy III.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have to say I probably love this series more than 50 Shades. I cannot wait for Entwined to be released.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Coming from a background of sci-fi and action films, expected to be bored by a chick flick, and found myself enthralled and chuckling throughout this jewel.  Triumph of the human spirit, the ugliness of 18th century slave trade, fantastic insights into how humans tick from a perspective from 200 years ago that still seem fresh today, and an actress who plays beyond her own physical gifts to become a fantastically beautiful young woman who practically glows from the inside with inner beauty.  I watched it three times in the first week, and found it consistently fills me with hope for human evolution.
B005HSL626|5.0|my husband is addicted to the game. he stays on the game for hours and hours.  and sometimes I get my turn
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I love the way the new definition of Sherlock Holmes has turned him into a physical action hero and added to his mental visualization capabilities, and I like the younger more athletic version of Watson.  The depiction of 18th century England feels like a minor English history lesson.  The atmosphere of burgeoning science being treated as magic is a treat.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|This dinosaur has been so far my son's favorite. Like most 3/4 years old he is obsessed by dinosaurs, he really likes the fact this one's jaw moves.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This was easy to install and navigate on my Kindle fire, and now I can see the weather pattern as long as I have wi-fi!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I'm glad that I was talked into starting this series, even though it's 10 years old. Complex characters that you route for despite yourself.
B008Y73940|5.0|Matthew McConaughey plays a very convincing lawyer, who is hardened his heart to only care about winning the case. The ending was great, and I hope, is indicative of all humanity, that there is a redeeming element in all of us. Enjoyed the movie.
B00BF11STU|4.0|This dark and daring movie was well written and the female lead was excellent. I appreciate how provocative it is.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Using it to download PDF's of my local paper to read on my Kindle Fire HD. Sometimes the file goes into the folder ok, sometimes it downloads as an unreadable file. I suspect, though, that it is a problem with the paper web site, not the ES File program. When it does download correctly, it makes it very easy to find the file and read it on my Kindle Fire HD.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|I love this app. You will too!  If you want to mess around with playing on keys, recording, improvising, etc. you can do it. It limits the number of octaves but it is still useful.  Can't wait to find out more ways to use it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Parts are very explicit but the book is good and it ended with me wishing there was one more book
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I thought the free version made me happy. My sleep issues have vanished now that I can go to sleep using this app on my Kindle Fire. It works great!  The extra sounds are nice (compared to the free version) but the ones I already had were good enough.  It's easy to use and you can program and save your favorite combos to go to sleep by. I love this app.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I first read this book in high school. I enjoyed it then, but now,as a bit older and slightly more mature person I find the depth of what I used to consider a nice short narrative so much more compelling and touching.
B001R0LOES|5.0|Great scripting and photography of the historical Irish revolution. Some language and violence may be too much for children under 13 .
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Good storyline. Believable. Exciting, and a few unexpected twists. A good way to spend an afternoon. Balsamic is a great storyteller. I'm looking forward to his next book.
B007HACDLK|4.0|First time I am reading Vince Flynn and I am impressed by the selection of a contemporary topic and the gripping narration .<br />Suspense is built right from beginning and is carried till end of the book. Iplan to read his other books also.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is way better than the free version. You guys should make age of the zombies free. Please. I really want it.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Doing what you can with the hand you are dealt.  That's what detectives are &#34;dealing&#34; with here.  The winner is....
B004DLPXAO|4.0|An e-reader like this discards the need to carry books around.<br />I use this in my net book and tablet...
B0055PMJMW|5.0|With Bosch and Edgar on the job, there are bound to be conflicts in devotion to working hours.  But as usual, the job wins out as far as Bosch is concerned.
B003ZFCBJ0|5.0|I recommend this movie to someone who likes a heartfelt romance about teenagers. Also to some who loves when families reunite with one another. I like this movie because if you were or are a teenager you would be able to relate . So these are my reasons for watching this movie now it you time for you to watch the movie and tell amazon yours.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|It is good but is a bit tricky to calibrate it. There are videos on youtube and files that you can download to help calibrate.
B001L5YW9I|4.0|Awesome classic about a wild frontier. Definitely an Oldie but a goodie! Worth watching a few times. If you haven't seen it, definitely not a waste of time!
B004W1GCNC|1.0|I liked it at first but they add so much garbage to the show. most of us don't have to be entertained by watching affairs and homosexuality and abortions. too bad
B0063IH60K|4.0|Terrific Solitaire game, but an ad appears whenever a re-deal is made.  Wish there was some way to shut it down.  Good graphics.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I read the sample which I thought had pretty good potential. characters develop quickly, and are interesting enough. It is a very easy read and a quck read. I like the fact that the books are published quickly so you do not have to wait long for the next one. There are numerous typos and syntax mistakes however. Overall, I like the series and for the price, think it is a good value.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app! There are 80+ sounds, the ability to set a timer, sound mix suggestions, and specific frequencies for different results. I do not know about the science behind it, but I know that when I put the relaxing frequency on with my headphones I feel better.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|Excellent entertainment with the ever present twist that you never know how it will end. I enjoy the unconventional thought process that Simon Baker employs.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|A reasonably fun CCG that doesn't appear to need real cash to beat it. So far I've made it through all 3 campaigns, pillaged countless people, and won every versus match without spending a cent. Given the price it's really hard to go wrong with this game unless you have poor impulse control, then again that's true of any F2P game. On a side note the game's story says &quot;Duelist&quot; so much, I half expected &quot;Lord Velik&quot; to rip off his mask and turn out to be Seto Kaiba. Missed opportunity if you ask me.
B00C27LB20|4.0|I first heard Jake Bugg when he appeared as an act at the end of The Late Show. I was immediately taken by Jake's unique and alluring voice. The next day I purchased his album on Amazon after sampling more of his music. I am looking forward to Jake's next album.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is a very intriguing TV show that has my whole family wanting to see what happens next. I would recommend this show to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is very well done. It is greatly superior to the solitary game to which I was previously subscribed. The dealing is quick and the program never hangs up.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Intelligent courageous viewing  -- beautiful artful delivery of twisted subject matter.<br />This does not feel like network television.  Very sophisticated and upscale.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|I was fairly knowledgeable on this topic prior to reading this book, I am VERY familiar with Temple Gradin, have studied her life, read all her books, have watched numerous documentaries, and have read several other books BUT this book is different.<br /><br />The way that Foer presents the information is factual, unique, wonderful, and horrific all at the same time.  Many of the other books on this topic that I have read I have walked away feeling...yes good information...but, clearly there is an agenda here and I need to be aware of that as I digest this information.  I FELT NO agenda in this book, is Foer a vegetarian...yes, does he also at the same time believe in humane family farms and slaughterhouses...yes, can these two ideologies exist at the same time...YES!!!<br /><br />Not only did I feel a overall lack of agenda by Foer but I was reminded of this throughout the book and instead of &#34;preaching or judgement&#34; I got presented with questions that every human being should consider when considering their food choices and AGAIN reminded that these questions are questions that need to be answered personally based on YOUR ideas, views, values, and ethics.<br /><br />Eating Animals reads like a novel, is packed with information and facts but at the same time has personal stories that are thoughtful, funny, and entertaining.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book to ANY human being that EATS!!!
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Enjoyed this movie very much.  Not much you can find to watch these days that is not saturated with sex and violence.  Enjoyed it immensely!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Good plot; but  a little repetitive. Does portray racial indifference & violence. Liked the cyclical opening that builds to a suspenseful ending.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|Very well presented. Easy to follow.well researched. A must for those looking for an easier way to lose wait and gain better health.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Really nothing better than this series.  If you like war and intrigue you will love this.  I buy them through Amazon as soon as it comes out.
B0095P31L6|5.0|A lot of fun for the whole family. Would see it again in the future. Wholesome and suit ages 5 and up
B005544TRQ|4.0|Good story line, strong (fairly) three dimensional characters...easy on the eyes no matter what your preference and enough suspense to keep me watching!
B00936A0RU|5.0|Great movie!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Excellent read so far....story is unraveling quite nicely....John Grisham has done it again. What an outstanding writer! He never disappoints me!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing. It made me cry, laugh, think, and reflect my life. I know this sounds dumb but I have never read a book that made me feel this way. I would fully and completely recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Thanks for listening.
B00BI745AA|5.0|I never saw this on the stage, but this movie truly kept me glued to my seat. I love musicals
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game reminds me of Gallaga that I used to play alll the time! Really addicting! No issues at all with the game.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|Maybe I did something wrong with the settings. Ever since installing App my battery is draining so fast! Even though I am not using the app it's in the background and my phone will not auto turn off when not in use unless I turn it off myself. I will keep it for one more day to see if anyone can help me set it so I can use it without the drain. Then I'm uninstalling. Too bad because I really like it otherwise! It would have been a nice feature to have available when I need it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was an epic book but it wasn't as good as the first. I didn't like how the decisions were made.
B003UN409Q|4.0|Fun to watch Val Kilmer tour Jim Morrison's life. Stone must have had fun recreating the 5 or so year span of this film.
B0033806MI|1.0|I didn't like this book at all. It was not like the other Percy Jackson books I think it was a side project
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Probably one of the best books I have ever read. The story is very compelling and the character development is beyond perfect. The author gets you to connect with each of the characters at a deep level to the point that you feel the pain and sadness they feel as if it you were experiencing it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's a good story, well executed. Love Maggie Smith. The backdrop is also beautiful and alive which really helps set up the story.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Falling in love with this book is much like the love Eleanor & Park share: easy & steadfast. The characters are real and written by someone who remembers all the firsts and how to explain how it all feels. I can't wait to read more by Rainbow Rowell.
B00170M2OY|5.0|Always have loved this movie. A childhood classic. It's a good re-make of the Peter Pan story, changing it a little.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous should be in every family's video library.  Depicting many of life's very real hurts and how very real people deal with them, either to defeat or as a stepping stone to victory.  You may have heard that &#34;real men aren't wimps&#34; and this movie is a wonderful portrayal both of those who are crushed by their difficulties and those who triumph IN those same events.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It only took one episode for me to become so enthralled with Downton Abbey. The settings, the era, and the characters (and the brilliant actors who portray them!), all provide a glimpse of a time where class was truely divided, and each new their place. From the bottom-up to the fortunate-chosen one's, DA depicts each character's responsibilities to the family, the workforce, Downton Abbey (the castle) and the way of life during that time before WWI. There's also a wee bit amount of family drama and heartache as well.<br />I like to think that my ancestor's lived in this manner.... regardless of which position or role they played. I highly recommend this series - as well as most Masterpiece Classics. Just awesome!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was an exciting and easy read. It really makes you wish life was really like this.... sigh.. Christian Grey.
0765325950|5.0|So if you have made it to the last the last book in the series of fourteen and one prequel, I doubt there is anything I am going to say that is going to make somebody keep reading with my review. I would think anybody reading this review will be here for two different reasons. One would be you have finished reading the series and now you are checking out what others thought about the book. Or two is that you are thinking about starting this series and your checking out reviews of the last book to see if the journey is worth it. I will address the first group with spoilers. Then address the second with no spoilers.<br /><br />*******MAJOR SPOILERS*********<br /><br />I loved this book. From Rand's riding off into the sunset to Egwenen's sacrifice. I have never read a book that was this action packed. After Rand has the meeting with all the worlds leaders it never lets up. I thought the major characters send off's were very satisfying. Mat gets the women he needs and also the women he deserves. Him being the general that leads the forces off men was a great evolution of his character. One of my all time favorite Matt moments is when he gets the realization that he is in fact a nobleman. Then we have Perrin's showdown in the wolf dream. Perrin is one of the strongest characters in the Wheel of Time. I thought his final chapters were a great send off. His aid for Rand takes turns I didn't expect. Then when you think he is out of the fight, he comes back swinging! Rand's showdown with the dark one was better than I could have dreamed. I never could see what it would be like. Since I didn't understand a lot about the dark one I wasn't sure what to expect. What it came down to what a metaphorical and metaphysical battle of ideologies that the entire series has dealt with. The different worlds that they create were the real highlight of this novel. In the end Rand lived. I liked that. I never expected him to have a chance at a happy life in the end. As for Egwene I knew that her sacrifice made sense but it hurts thinking about. She left the world protecting the light.<br /><br />I did have one major problem with this novel. This series has gone on for so long that the ending has to pay off a ridiculous amount of material. Towards the end I found myself getting frustrated with the most minor characters getting their final moment. I understand why it had to be done this way, but it made parts of the finale really drag.<br /><br />*******END OF SPOILERS*********<br /><br />Now for those who are trying to decide if they should take the journey. If tackling a fourteen book series like this sounds fun then do it. What I mean is that if you understand that this series isn't perfect, and that it might even bore you at times, but if your willing to endure it, for one long epic journey, then it will reward you in the end. The characters that inhabit this series are some of the my favorites I have read from any series. Jordan though he can be long winded is a heck of a writer. The last three books alone written by Sanderson is some of the best reading that I have ever done. This is Fantasy enthusiast! I am very glad that I took this journey. All 4,056,130 words of it.t her sacrifice made sense but it hurts thinking about. She left the world protecting the light.<br /><br />I did have one major problem with this novel.

B005HSL626|5.0|I love it its very challenging, makes me want to keep trying to beat my last score, win new blades and open up more things to play with
0812550706|5.0|This is one of those books that I have always wanted to get to. So now that the movie is coming out I finally decided to take that copy I bought a long time ago and actually read it. Man was I glad that I did. This is a great book! I have read some reviews complaining about the format of the book. I found nothing wrong with it. In every situation that Ender finds himself in what I took away was the emotional scars that take their toll on him. Ender evolves a lot in this book. It all feels strangely real.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of the story is the dynamic that Ender has with his family. It gives good parallels for the reader to think upon.<br /><br />The only thing I can come up with as a complaint is that the author makes way to many fart references for my taste. Though truly if that is the worst complaint that I can come up with then that says a lot.<br /><br />This book did its job. It was a compelling story with characters that are way above the curve. I can't wait to see what Card does with the rest of the series. So don't do what I did. Stop stalling and read this book.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|when ever I show this to my friends they smile and can not stop laughing.  If you want a pick me up for the day everyone should download it.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I'm not an engineer, but still liked this story a lot.  I don't think you need to be a math or science person to enjoy this story, but I bet you would get a lot more out of it if you are.  The obstacles this astronaut is faced with while on Mars is incredible.  This is a very entertaining read.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I want to thank the people that made this move! It`s so good. It teaches a great lesson to children!
B00008L3U1|5.0|I was recently looking for some new comedies, as I am growing up in life, and Jack is one of the movies I purchased.  I was looking for movies that were actually funny, and when you think of naturally funny actors one of them you think of is robin williams.  Let me tell you he did not dissapoint.  I thought the movie was funny, and touching at the same time.  I mean it wasnt laugh out loud funny at times which was ok, the storyline was great.  I think more kids these daya should watch this move, it would teach them to be more accepting to others.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Fun to read. Enjoyed it. Easy to read audit flows just as Ellen talks. Seems she and you are sitting in the same room and she is speaking to you of her thoughts, her inquires, her mannerisms.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I'm taking my son to see the movie ! I love the game already the movie is going to be awesome we are really enjoying the game!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a fun but addictive game. Its easy to play but requires concentration. I had no trouble telling the difference between the tiles and the background unlike another reviewer. Using the clue button helped me discover that not all tiles have to match exactly. would 'purchase' this again in a second.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Hahahahha I loved this book!! It made me laugh so badly. I like Drew. He is just one honest guy. Most of the things he says are true about men, women and relationships. Great storyline!! To be a debut book, Emma did a great job. Keep it up! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun but its similar to most games like temple run 2 and temple run but I like subway surfer better its cartoonish and is better and they get new characters all the time and there always changing the place
0811875040|5.0|This cookbook is exactly what I was looking for! It has great pictures on probably 75% of the recipes so it helps to know what your creation should look like! It was worth the $12.03!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I got this book because I know it's going to be a movie and I am glad I did it.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|I'm usually up for crude, juvenile humor, but this was a disaster!  I guess you have to really be into Seth McFarlane humor to enjoy this, but I now know that I am not.  I found the movie to be ultra-crude, and think the marketing made this movie out to be a \\"suitable for kids\\" movie because of the animated teddy bear...what could be more fun than a live teddy bear that is with you for life?<br /><br />WARNING:  This is NOT a kid's movie!!  Don't make the mistake of watching it with anyone under 21.  Drugs, alcohol, sex galore - seems the writers forgot to focus on any kind of actual \\"plot,\\" and settled for cheap laughs with the former.  I generally like Mark Whalberg, but this was definitely his worst.  Wish Amazon offered a money-back guarantee!  This movie sucks hard.<br /><br />As usual, the quality of Amazon's download was great - just a bad movie.  I gave it one star because the animation was good.
B00C7JCDO8|5.0|Got to give Mr Coverdale credit, he has masterminded the art of marketing the same thing over and over. Given the fact that I'm a huge fan, of course I bought it. Nothing new here, great songs, great performances especilly by drummer Brian Tichy, but production is just OK. I suspect they are a hard band to record live. But in the studio they are killer....Keep it going Dave !!!!!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Didn't know whether to laugh or cry.  Opted for a bit of both, just wanted to shake Don, admired Rosie's perserverance, what a hoot!
B00C8SBNMG|5.0|I'm a huge Burning Rain Doug Aldrich / Keith St John fan. This is probably one of the most under rated &#34;part time&#34; bands on the scene today. To date this is their strongest release yet with the other two cd's close by. The production, songwriting and overall performance is second to none. Song for song, this cd just kills !!!!!! And a big treat is the cover of the Zeppelin song Kashmir. The results are uncanny to the original. It pays tribute to what is obviously a huge influence to Aldrich and St John. All I can say here is I can't wait until they do this again. The only downside here is probably no touring as a result or Doug's commitment to Whitesnake this year which is cool  but man would I love to see Burning Rain live !!!!!!!!!!  Buy this you, WILL NOT be disappointed
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book was amazing. I loved it front to back everything about it. Logan and Elizabeth's story has been the best I've ever read.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm so into this show. Season after season it never dissappoints me. They keep it interesting & suspenseful. Best show on television by far.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Fantastic combination of classical and modern. Saw them in concert earlier this month; they truly feel the music they play.
B004KKYX9K|5.0|This book was a real eye opner on the issues of death row prisoners and what can go wrong. Lovely story
B00003CXXJ|4.0|The shrek series is great to have for that rainy day when the grand kids come over. They never tire of the movies!
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book the ending was a real suprise I would highly recommed it, and an looking forward to Kates next book
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|My least favorite of the three books.  Some of the chapters were so long and drawn out.  The ending was okay.  The first book was the best one!
B002WN35DC|5.0|I chose this rating because the book teaches you what is invisible to your eyes, but what is visible to your heart.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My daughter loves watching this movie! I hated having to spend $14.99 on it but the fact that we don't need wi-fi to be able to watch is what I like. I just wish it would have been cheaper than that, especially for a digital copy.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted to read the book. Good book.  Good companion to the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B003VW54QO|5.0|They don't make them like this anymore!<br />A true classic!!! The costumed are perfect. The hat John Wayne wears in this film is the same hat he wore in the movie Stagecoach<br />Made by Baron Hats of Hollywood<br />Check out their website.
055357342X|5.0|To those who have read this entire series - some multiple times - this book is considered the highlight of the series.  I am glad to report that they are correct.<br /><br />The political intrigue, murders, surprises just never seem to end in this book.  All the way to the final pages, the reader is constantly being thrown for a loop.<br /><br />Loved the book.  I can see why GRRM has legions of fans.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Gosh Im glad I got this Kindle. Otherwise I would have never have known of such  interesting inspiring and well written works as this one. Tesla in a different context from anything I've read previously. Loved it, Sean!
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Part 3 undid everything cool about Iron Man that we witnessed in The Avengers. I mention The Avengers because the story picks up right after the events of that movie. All of a sudden the suits are made of cheap lego imitations, build up to a certain villain was a bait and switch, too much humor for its own good. Would not watch again.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Katniss had a tough journey for someone seventeen years old.  She tried to take over as her father and protect her family and everyone close to her. Unfortunately she couldn't!  This last book of the trilogy was sad.
B004QX07G4|3.0|It's moderately amusing. A little predictable. Not as as entertaining as Ellen herself. Maybe it would be better as an audio book.
B004K58GSO|5.0|Another John Watne winning western. Great cast! Great action Great costumes great dialogue great scenery love live live lived it
B0091WAWTM|5.0|This one sticks with you for a while.  Is there a difference between pagan and heathen?  Why did the major religion beliefs come to reject both?
B0067EKYS6|4.0|I have not read the novel THE GREAT GATSBY, nor have I seen other film versions.  To be honest, the little I knew about it didn't grab my attention enough to seek it out.  But when the most recent version was released, I thought it was time to broaden my horizons just a little.  I'll admit, seeing a film version is not a good substitute for reading the original...but there you go.  I haven't read it.  After seeing the film, it's more likely that I might read it, because I felt a number of questions were left unanswered by the film.  (I'll bet the book does the same, but somehow, it's easier to fill in blanks for oneself with a book.)<br /><br />Anyway, I came into the film with few expectations about the plot.  Essentially, you've got a narrator (Tobey Maguire as Nick) who moves into a small house next to the glittering party palace that belongs to the legendary and little-known Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio).  Nick gets to know Gatsby a little bit, and the two become fairly constant companions.  Nick is enlisted to help achieve Jay's goal of winning back the heart of the girl he has loved for years, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan).  He was once romantically involved with her, but war and money separated them.  Now Jay has money and he wants to spend it on his love.  Unfortunately, she's married to the reprehensible Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) and thus Daisy and Jay's road to togetherness does not run smooth.  Not at all.<br /><br />I don't know what all F. Scott Fitzgerald was trying to say about the times he lived in with his novel, but Baz Luhrmann's glitzy, noisy extravaganza seems to be commenting on wealth.  Yes, there's the idea that money can't buy happiness.  Or that we're destroying ourselves in a relentless pursuit of wealth.  I'd say the film also implies that we've become a society that has a self-imposed class system...where the \\"poor boy\\" can't get the \\"rich girl\\" unless he's got the money.  And in America, if one properly applies oneself, the poor boy can become rich enough for the girl to \\"love\\" him.  Yet love is now a possession, not a feeling.  Tom Buchanan doesn't really \\"love\\" Daisy in the romantic way we think of love...but he sure feels he owns her.  Jay may love Daisy, but he can only manifest this by showering her with \\"stuff\\"...and Daisy seems delighted and moved by the material goods.<br /><br />This is a fairly long movie, which is normally just fine with me if the movie is good.  But these people are so unlikeable that I grew tired of spending time with them.  It's tough to root for Jay & Daisy when so much of their passion is materially motivated.  This is perhaps an accurate and even scathing commentary to make on the nature of love in a deeply materialistic world...but it certainly makes it hard to get behind our central couple.  And Luhrmann spends much of his film exposing the viewer to the most shimmering and over-the-top parties and wealth consumption...it's admirable from a design standpoint, but it becomes almost numbing.  (We saw it in 3D...this was not really needed for this film.  The 3D was well done, but it didn't enhance the story for me.)<br /><br />Luhrmann also made the choice to collaborate with modern artists on the music and songs.  This was, in my opinion, a mistake.  Many of the songs selected were true classics of the period.  They are quite lively and exciting on their own.  Yet when a clearly hip-hop or rock influenced number comes on, it's very jarring.  This isn't A KNIGHT'S TALE, where part of the conceit is having rock music in a medieval story.  Luhrmann wants to have things both ways:  a detailed period piece, but modern sensibilities.  It is distracting.  No doubt it helped album sales...but it ticked me off as a filmgoer.<br /><br />The best parts of the film are in the performances.  DiCaprio is pretty terrific as Jay, and while it's tough to actually LIKE this guy, DiCaprio fills his character with many shadings and secrets.  Gatsby is a bit of an enigma (and wedon't know his entire story until late in the game), but DiCaprio makes him a compelling even charismatic presence.  Certainly the film demands a top-notch Gatsby, or there'd be no hope for it.  DiCaprio delivers once again, and makes the film worth seeing.  This is a 2.5 star film that I'm moving up to 3.5 stars just for this performance.  And I will further round it up to 4 stars (it's still 3.5 really but I can't pick that) because of Joel Edgerton.  His Tom Buchanan is a monster at times, but when he goes toe-to-toe with DiCaprio, he actually manages to win grudging respect from the audience.  He sees right through their romance and calls it for what it is.<br /><br />Carey Mulligan is a charming actress, but Daisy isn't a very fleshed out character.  In this case, I'd say the script betrays her a bit.  I still like her a lot, but THE GREAT GATSBY does nothing to move her down the road to real stardom.  And the role of Nick is problematic.  He's our narrator and guide, and unlike others, I didn't mind the idea of literally having some narration to help set the stage.  But Maguire gives a wan performance.  He's got a hang-dog look already, but he accompanies his appearance of being a milquetoast with a performance to match.  Nick is a fairly passive character, the man on the sidelines observing it all.  Yet he's onscreen so much that we need him to be more dynamic.  Maguire was simply a poor casting choice from the start.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'm glad I saw the film.  It has some moments of great visual spark.  It's an interesting story, and features a couple of top-notch performances.  But it is a bit too in love with itself, and Luhrmann's tendencies towards excess (I truly did not like MOULIN ROUGE) allows the film to run long enough that we become actively annoyed at these unlikeable characters.  It's unlikely I would ever see it again...but I do recommend that teen & adult audiences at least give it a look see (sans 3D).
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a REALLY fast read. It has WAY more substance than the movie.  I loved the man's relationship with his psychiatrist.  Love, Love, Loved it!!!
B002KGEORM|5.0|Great series, keeps you glued to the screen. I couldn't stop watching, waiting to see what was gonna happen next
B003KRJNBW|5.0|The Book Of Eli, while a post apocalyptic drama, falls into the All Time Greats Of Post Apocalyptic-Great Acting, Awesome Character, Good Development!!!
B0091WD4ZQ|4.0|Can't wait to see what's next for this couple.The movie moved at good pace while allowing us to see the beatiful sites of Vienna. Great chemistry didn't just happen in this movie, it was developed so gingerly, I couldn't help but want this couple to last forever.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|A truly well done period piece that's yet another period piece.  Chinatown is a metaphor for an altered world lacking truth.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|If you want to stay up on the weather this is it!  I use it to keep track of weather around the world...
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Splendid adaptation of the book. This movie is gorgeous to look at, very well cast and the acting is top notch as well. It's a fun adventure!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a really good, in-depth look at mental illness.  We decided to read this for book club.  Some had seen the movie.  I hadn't.  This is a sometimes uncomfortable trip inside the heads of several people with damaged psyches.  It is sometimes uncomfortable, but really helped me to understand and maybe have some empathy with people in my own life who sometimes act in what seems an irrational way to me, but obviously is not to them.
B008ALAHA4|3.0|Ok, it basically works. So it's hard to rate it too low. But there are two major problems:<br /><br />1.) It's tiny. Like smaller-than-my-pinky-nail tiny. It's not strong enough to leave on your laptop when you pack it, and you will constantly think you lost it. I finally ended up supergluing it to a keychain so at least I could hook it to something in transit.<br /><br />2.) When your laptop is closed, and you plug the mini-adapter in, then an older-generation power cord, your laptop will wake up. While it's closed. Which it doesn't do on a new mac with the new power cord, or on an old mac with an old power cord, because there's no freakin' reason why a closed Macbook should wake up on any change in the power. Not a big deal, but a sign that some signals were lost in translation.<br /><br />Will I buy more? Of course! I have like 12 older-generation power adapters around the house and just one of the new ones, so I'll probably get a few more. What choice does any of us really have in this short life?
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|very addictive game love that its free and has so many levels:) my 7 year old likes it too definitely
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Found this book intriguing and had not worked out the many twists and turns it took.  Loved the London war time ...could see the blitz happening and Jimmys photos.great read.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|I loved this movie, and it has stuck with me since I watched it. The only negative was how quickly some of the dialogue (in unique dialect) was spoken.  The story was very complex, with times being mixed up, past., present, future all intermingled.  I will need to see it at least once more, may more! The story is haunting.  What future are we headed for?
B009JZSFUY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE First Contact. This is my favoriteTrek movie of them all! Worf has one of his best lines ever!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I thought film were supposed to be entertaining. This one missed the mark. I think the actors did as much as they could but something big was missing.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The sci-fi movie industry today pales by comparison to the incredibly deep, human stories that The Great Bird of the Galaxy, Gene Roddenberry, shared with us nearly 50 years ago.  I would say, out of 79 episodes there were perhaps 20 truly remarkable episodes that offered insight into humanity and the challenges that space and technology might present to us.  Before there was A Space Odyssey, and long before Star Wars, there was original Star Trek: we'll never lose you, Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Uhuru & Chapel - never...
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|Well, I wasn't expecting this!! The last few albums Bowie released before withdrawing from the public eye were pretty decent, but this is his best work since Scary Monsters.  A seriously good album, one of the best of his long and storied career. Quit wasting your time reading this review and just order it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A fun game to shoot the breeze but definitely needs some work to motivate the higher levels to keep playing.
B008PC1GF8|5.0|I totally agree with Mark E. Stenroos' earlier review considering this remastered, \\"Orignals\\" reissue of, IMHO, the greatest performance of Bruckner's greatest work! I've haven't always been bowled-over by an \\"Orignal\\" reissue - I still find the fabled Kleiber Beethoven 5/7 [[ASIN:B000001GPX Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 5 & 7]] harsh sounding in the \\"Original\\" issue, and the SACD reissue [[ASIN:B00007KMOX Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 5 & 7]] disappointed me tremendously, but back to Bruckner.<br /><br />I owned the first 2-CD issue of the performance and, although, it was quite wonderful, it still sounded a bit congested at the top - not anymore. The entire recording is opened up with more \\"air\\" around the brass and timpani, and the strings are wonderfully detailed. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B005SHTXN0|5.0|This was a fantastic movie. Dustin Hoffman has earned a whole new level of respect from me. His acting was incredible, and the storyline was well developed.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|The season finale was great! We were unable to watch our DVR recording due to bad signal on our Uverse. We were able to find the recording through our Wii!! Loved being able to watch without commercials. And the two episodes were definitely worth the $1.99! We will definitely be back to watch more!!!
B008GAXUGW|5.0|But I have heard many of the recordings compiled in it, especially the performances by La Magnifica Comunita of the string quintets, Luigi Boccherini's finest compositions. I've previously reviewed those performances, so you can gather what you want of my appreciation for the ensemble and for Boccherini. The point now is that this compendium is an incredible bargain! And by the by, Boccherini is an incredible composer.<br /><br />Just tryin' to be helpful ...
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|I saw this many many years ago but I wanted my 13 year old son to experience it.  He has seen Avator, Hobbit,  Iron Man but he still was entertained and captivated by this movie.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Having loved his previous novels, I couldn't wait to get my hands on And The Mountains Echoed. After a terrific start, especially an spellbinding tale that the father narrates to his two children, the novel started telling too many stories about the lives of the many characters that intersect with the main protagonists, siblings Abdullah and Pari. His previous books centered on characters we deeply cared about, and never took the focus off the main protagonists no matter how many important supporting characters existed. In this new book I really wanted more story on the siblings and the plight of their separation, and not so much about many of the other characters, which were not very interesting. I should have waited for the library copy instead.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved this! Can't wait to see season four. Is Matthew really gone? I pray not!  Will Edith follow her heart?
B0071MDA2U|5.0|This eBook is great! The videos of Lauren Oliver commenting on scenes in te book just adds to the reading experience. The Delirium triology is one of my favorites!!
B00AEFXEN6|5.0|American Beauty is a great movie. Kevin Spacey is most excellent in his performance. The story and theme is deep, compelling and at times funny. The BluRay provides a high quality picture.
