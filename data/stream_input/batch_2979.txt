B008HJGPVO|5.0|I love having the option of three different points to choose from.  The stylus is also easy to hold on to.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like being able to read books on my phone and not have to carry my iPad all the time. I can buy a book on my phone and then transfer it to my iPad---have to download another free ap to the iPad for that. My one complaint is that I can find no way to change the copy to unjustified so you get huge spaces between words on the small screen. Being a graphic designer, that bothers me a lot.
0231161166|4.0|The Epigenetic Revolution, How modern Biology is Rewriting our Understanding of Genetics, Disease and Inheritance. This book is about the recent developments in epigenetics:  interesting, fascinating, exciting, marvelous and sometimes mind-boggling. But not a revolution, epigenetics is not really overthrowing anything, but discovering a lot; it is not re-writing our understanding of Genetics, Disease and Inheritance, it is actually simply writing it. That being said, cut out the hype and you have a fascinating book, a GREAT introduction to epigenetics, a field in which quite some developments happened in the past decade.<br /><br />Epigenetics in the broad sense is anything that influences the expression of genes. We have known for decades that there must be something more than just the genetic code (hence not revolutionary), since our cells are quite different, while having the same DNA. What epigenetics is doing is discovering the mechanisms. A journey of discovery rather than a revolution.<br />So far the methylation of cytosine (cytosine pre guanine: CpG) in DNA and the acetylation of histone-tails and accompanying cascades appear to be the most important mechanisms.<br />Why are identical twins not identical? How are half the X chromosomes switched off (at least in female eutherian mammals)? Why don't we grow teeth in our eyes? How does imprinting found in mammals and flowering plants work? That -and quite a bit more- is expression of genes, and that is what epigenetics is all about. And this book will give you insight.<br />The implications for possible therapies for a range of pathologies, from autism to cancer, are fascinating, potentially much more promising than the disappointing gene therapies. As yet -the author is honestly clear on that- only just that: potential promises.<br /><br />However, I have some serious and less serious problems with this book.<br />- The explicit mentioning of Lamarckian inheritance is mistaken. The epigenetic persistence of some acquired traits -and in fact in most cases the parents did not acquire the trait themselves- over a few generations is not Lamarckian inheritance. Lamarck proposed a kind of will to acquire, and that use would generate adaptation. Although the latter is not really impossible in the neo-darwinian view, the examples of the agouti mice and descendants of the Dutch Hunger-winter really do not qualify as adaptations. Carey is not on the spot there, not on the cutting edge, as it where.<br />- She does not make clear if all persistent DNA methylation over generations involves retro-transposons, there are some evolutionary possible reasons it would be, but the author does not go into that, a serious shortcoming Immo. Retro-transposons, believed to be parasitic/symbiontic virus constitute nearly half of our genome (now that could be considered revolutionary, but is not really epigenetics). Striking here is -albeit not mentioned- that the promotor of the trophoblast, the placenta, appears to be retroviral. Too little there.<br />- In the chapters about imprinting she does not mention David Haig, who placed imprinting in it's evolutionary context of parent/offspring conflict. He made quite a few predictions that were borne out. Just a strange omission, methinks.<br />- A minor irritation: we do not talk about 'professor' Einstein, Fermi, Dawkins, Williams or Haldane (although the latter was known as 'Prof\\") , I think that the likes of Anzim Surani and Rudi Jaenisch  are famous enough to be spared that address. It is somehow demeaning.<br /> -They (Surani, Jaenish, Yamanaka, Gurdon, Whitelaw and others) also do not need Carey's pleading for a Noble Prize: their work speaks for itself, methinks. On the other hand one may admire her fervor to spread the importance and recognition of her heroes.<br />- The references only mention the number of the chapter, not the chapter's title or the pages, admittedly a minor shortcoming, but very annoying, because one has to go back to ascertain the number of the chapter.<br />- The references of primary sources omit the title of the article, very -nay extremely- annoying. I consider this not a  minor drawback, but an important one. It is a shabby habit that should be strongly discouraged. Notes should even give more info about the contribution than the title, methinks. The likes of Pinker, Ridley or Coyne are exemplary there.<br />- The glossary is very useful, but quite incomplete, nearly half of the abbreviations (and there are a lot of them) used are absent in the glossary<br /><br />This book may be quite a bite for the biologically innocent, some parts need quite a bit of munching, and yet it is just an introduction, that is just how it is.  It lacks a bit of the greater picture, but that is inherent to a quickly developing field. As such a highly recommended introduction.<br /><br />Despite all these major and minor shortcomings this book should be read. It is absolutely fascinating, and -as said- sometimes  mind-boggling. I would have given it 5 stars, if not for the shortcomings and irritations. Hence 4 stars only.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|I have downloaded this game many times it won't download I've seen lonniedos do it on his channel I have it on my iPhone5s it downloaded on it but not on kindle fire2
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I really liked this movie, I have watched all of the marvel movies and this is my favorite so far
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very interesting story-line and some good twists. I would certainly recommend it to friends (and have), particularly for sci-fi fans.
B00DFFHUUA|5.0|I like this movie, it is probably more of a guy movie, lot's of gun fights and action, very action packed
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There are no words to describe how great this book is! I am completely stunned and I can't wait to read the next book.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Okay, you could argue it never left, but let's face it: the Rush from the 70s and Rush from the 80s onward are very different bands. One band was a progressive rock giant, creating 4 spectacular progressive rock albums each with 15-20 minute masterpieces that are undeniable classics. The other band is just as good, even though they became what one could call a progressive pop band (and they made the transition better than just about any of their peers). I like both bands equally, but I was longing for a return to the 70s form, creating concept pieces with the addition of their modern lyrical themes.<br /><br />Well, did we get it in Clockwork Angels? For the most part yes. The album fits firmly in the category of progressive rock. At the same time it is also undeniably modern day Rush, with all their modern sound and noise present (don't worry no loudness war rant here, I like the noise). But it also is a callback to the earlier Rush, with the entire album having a loose concept from beginning to end. The concept involves a futuristic society with interstellar travel and a rigid belief system enforced by the Big Brother like Watchmaker. What I really appreciate about the album though, is that almost all the songs can be taken out of context and still be enjoyable. Some of Rush's best tracks ever are on this album, particularly BU2B, which to me calls back to their early hits like Working Man or A Passage to Bangkok. Halo Effect is probably the best song on the album lyric wise. It reminds me a lot of Closer to the Heart, and I have a feeling it will become a concert staple.<br /><br />The one complaint I do have is that I wish Neal had gone farther with his concept. While this might have sacrificed some of the commercial appeal of the record, I think it would have been great to have a true full fledged concept album that told this same story. While the songs are all great, there is an element of being unfinished concept wise. The latter half of the album suffers from this somewhat, as the songs become longer, and you realize their telling a story you don't have enough information to fully understand.<br /><br />Overall though, this is a spectacular release and hopefully indicates a return to Rush's early form.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is the best game ever. LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH I NEVER WANT TO STOP PLAYING IT. THIS AN AWESOME GAME ITS SO MUCH FUN.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|The design and usability of the pulse is pretty nice.  But synching is slow and totally unreliable.  It usually fails midway through. If phone sleeps it fails.  Even if it gets 90%, none of the data is saved.  You have to start at zero again.  WIthout synch you can't view much useful data except steps for the day.  But sleep data is inaccessible.  I'll probably give it another 30 days and if Withing can't make it work, I'll need to abandon this product.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER BYE IT OR YOU'LL REGRET IT!! I'M SERIOUS  AND I'M NEVER SERIOUS made on 10/3/13 that is
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Well written, fast paced story with twists and turns.  They characters were carefully intertwined to make the story line not  Interesting.  Interesting  characters with rich relationships. Nice ending to surprise the reader.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I wish that we could fly over trains<br />five hundred meters could be a high score that nobody could beat
B00003CXDD|5.0|A classic film of the era of fantasy adventure films.  This film is a fantastic adventure with sword fights, sorcery, high speed horse chases, and all sorts of magical creatures.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I'm not a good reviewer for this app.  I have been a retired person keeping in touch with people and issues I'm interested in via Linked-IN for some time.  We recently got Android phones, so I added this app and have tested it a little.  I have problems with the on-screen keyboards on all the tablet/smartphone devices, and this app does not help resolve those issues.  If I'm following something closely, I may use it.
0061726834|5.0|The writing was a bit different from other books I have read. It was a bit slower on creating the plot, but I can't think of any way it could been faster to develop. Without a great deal of buildup, the plot would have fallen very short. This is a great read, and an oddly realistic view of a very strict military state. Overall a very good read.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Enjoyed it on many levels. Characters were developed masterfully, but you must be patient as all first impressions will be wrong.
1451696191|5.0|After watching the movie, which was amazingly close to the book, I decided to purchase this book. Much to my original dismay, the book is written as a series of letters. (Charlie to the anonymous person) I steadily put off reading this book for fear of not enjoying the format. I was wrong. The format doesn't hurt the flow of the story. Each letter can be considered a chapter (Or sub-chapter if you prefer) to the story. Some things are put into great detail, while others are left dangling. It's reminiscent of the sporadic mind of a teen. I enjoyed the twists and turns and have now read The Perks of Being a Wallflower 3 times. The book is very tiny, but is packed with a great story. This is definitely a must-have book for any reader.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a cute book.  This is a perfect beach read with humor and romance.  The light and quick pace of this book makes a quick and easy read.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|I love Star Trek and sci fi.  Please add more sci fi tv shows and movies.  I was never able to watch much tv when I was raising my 5 kids, so I'm grateful that I can catch all the episodes I missed on Amazon Prime and in order!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Challenging but not so much that it becomes frustrating. As one progresses through the different levels logical thinking comes more into play. Right when one thinks the challenge has been met, the dreaded red \\"x\\" appears! Fortunately the game can be restarted. Graphics are attractive making this a pleasant addition to one's game collection.
B001M0HGR2|4.0|The movie was pretty good but I didn't like having to pay again (a fee to rent and the yearly fee for Amazon Prime) for a movie this old.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Good to hear how Danny got on. Rated it a little less than most of Mr.Kings works. However, if you hadn't read the Shining, you'd have pitched it before end of first chapter. Though I certainly can appreciate AA, your average reader may find it a little, rah, rah, yaaaah, AA! On that subject. In other words it spends more time on AA cliches than needs to. But, Mr.King is still that.... The King of Novelists to me.
B006LSZECO|1.0|If you like reading a book with vulgar language through the entire book then you might not mind this.  I found it disgusting and completely unnecessary.  I only finished the book because it was a book club reading and I wanted to see if there was anything redeeming about it.  The plot took a very, very long time to get you interested. Very slow beginning.  Since it was supposedly \\"a page turner\\" I continued on.  Eventually it has an interesting plot.  I was completely disappointed in the ending.  It seemed like the author couldn't figure out a good ending so it just kind of ends.<br />I've never read anything else by this author but due to the unnecessary language in this one, I won't be reading any others.<br />Would have given it zero stars if that was an option.
0596522347|5.0|I got this months before an Edward Tufte one day course I attended and thought it was okay. Then I saw his presentation and realized this book was the way to go for visualizations and presentation. The topics and ideas in this book are fairly current and better suited for the workforce.
B008VBYN80|5.0|it is really fun. it is a mix of clash of the clans and Sim city. really fun love it
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It seemed like the more I read into this book the more repetitive it became. It got to the point where I was just skimming the pages to get the book over with. I gave it three stars because the story was good if u could get past all the useless fluff and the over done sex scenes. It also irritated me that there was not one average looking person in the book they were all described as being these beautiful people. I don't think I'll be reading the next book after this book I just don't care what happens next
B006R1T40I|5.0|The above title should clue you in on my bias. The music on this cd is very well produced just shy of being over-produced. So there is a lot to listen to in each song. Love the organ in &#34;Split Decision.&#34; Every rock song should include the organ or saxophone. Or a harmonica at a minimum.

B008Y212PI|5.0|I like to relax with mostly mindless geometric puzzles/games at the end of the day. These puzzles are definitely not &#34;mindless&#34; and I am enjoying engaging in the increasing challenge of these logic puzzles. I thought at first I would become frustrated as they become more difficult, but the hints help, and I can choose to &#34;ignore&#34; mistakes. Thoroughly enjoyable!

B00846REIS|3.0|Having this be only the second erotic novel (series) I have read, I was sorely disappointed in the similarities with Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James. The character profiles between Christian and Gideon and even Anastasia and Eva had me believing this series was going to be replica series. This was my belief throughout the entire first book, however Reflected in You is where the storyline takes its own direction and multiplies with several intriguing plots. Day is a much more skilled writer and has a vast vocabulary so each scene doesn't feel like a repeat, as in many from 50 Shades. I think Fifty Shades of Grey may have received more exposure and popularity not only because it was published first, but because of its elementary writing style it attracted the reluctant readers along with the more dedicated. My only disappointments was the similarity with 50 shades and not knowing it was a series (at least 5 novels) instead of a trilogy.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|The charge on the Legend last so long that I really don't need this batter powered charger. If they seriously degrade the power efficiency of the Legend, then it will be a great product.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I found the Chromecast to be pretty cool the first time I plugged it in, but after realizing it's wimpy to non-existent support for amazon prime video, I decided to return it.  Yes it has access to the web, but it just didn't cast the video from Amazon for me.  Besides, I didn't need a glorified youtube viewer.<br /><br />Besides that I had an issue getting my device to connect to it after the initial setup.  I would set it up, could cast some things, but once I closed the app on my phone, it wouldn't find the chromecast again.  I factory reset the Chromecast a number of times before tossing up my hands and sending it back.  So despite its low price tag, it went back.<br /><br />Perhaps a Roku is what I will end up with.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love love love love love love this book! This is an amazing series. George R.R. Martin is astounding. I've watched the series on TV but they don't hold a candle to the books. Read these books. I promise you that you won't be able to put them down!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works well. Pleasant look and  good alarm. Doesn't seem to eat up battery life. I am happy with it !!

B0072NWJRK|3.0|The author seems to want to write a long book so I found it too wordy and repetitive.  It could have been a very good story.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|A wonderful  explosion of character development as well as situational suspense.  best series  on TV.  Can't put it down once you've started watching.  .
0385743564|4.0|Not the author's best work, but a solid read. Fans of Sanderson will recognize a lot of his trademarks, including fun characters. However, given the relative brevity of the story (entire plot takes place within a few weeks) the characters are not as fleshed out nor as interesting as his usual fare.<br /><br />The Character of David is a workable main character, and from most other authors, would be perfectly fine. The problem is, I know Sanderson can do better. David displays the possibility for exceptional development, but ultimately fails to deliver on much of that potential. Unlike characters like Vin or Siri or Kaladin, David never moves beyond Basic late-teen/early twenty protagonist. He's socially awkward, intelligent, with (surprise - surprise) exceptional determination. He's also good at improvising. What you never really get to see is his failings. He never gets human enough to really sympathize.<br /><br />All in all, a decent book from most authors, But I tend to expect better from Sanderson.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Don't know why I ddn't watch it while it was on TV!!!! Characters are believable and  situtions keep you  on  the edge of your seat.  Very suspensful.
B004PYDBVM|5.0|Was motivated to read this after reading Escape from Camp 14.  Apparently this book had an impact on President Bush too.  Gives great insight into the truth about North Korea.  Some history is described and any one interested in history around Korean War would enjoy this.  This true story is heart wrenching as well as very informative.
B004A7OQKY|5.0|I used this DVD for the first time yesterday and my legs are sore.  I was an avid exercise enthusiaist before becoming pregnant, but haven't exercised much in the past 5 months since becoming pregnant.

B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|Many people feel that Bob lost his way in 1970 when Self Portrait came out.<br />I actually enjoyed the album(except In Search of Little Sadie.) However I was puzzled by the direction Bob was going.<br />It seemed like a Bob Dylan easy listening album to me. Like I said, I liked it though.<br />When I first heard Another Self Portrait (ASP), I was immedately going to give it 5 stars. Then after 2 weeks 3 stars.<br />However 4 stars seems fair. Bob's voice has never sounded better, clear as a bell.<br /><br />Most of the songs are real good \\"Pretty Saro\\", \\"Alberta#3\\", wonderful \\"Spanish is the Loving Tongue\\" \\"Railroad Bill\\"<br />\\"These Hands\\" alternate \\"I Threw it All Away\\"\\"House Carpenter\\" \\"Only a Hobo\\" \\"I'll Be Your Baby Tonight\\" \\"Working on a Guru\\" to name a few<br />Songs I didn't like:\\"Annies Going to Sing Her Song\\" \\"In Search of Little Sadie\\".\\"Tattle O'Day\\"<br />I would like to have seen included: \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Gates of Eden\\" with George Harrison, \\"Living the Blues\\" live on the Johnny Cash show,<br />(I thought that \\"Living the Blues \\" was going to be his next single.) and some songs from the Johnny Cash sessions.<br /><br />For the most part this is a very good album. I'm comparing it to Bob's other albums.<br />5 star albums are Freewheelin', Bringing it all Back Home, Highway 61, Blonde on Blonde, John Wesley Harding,<br />Blood on the Tracks, Slow Train Coming, Saved, Infidels, Oh Mercy. So I'm comparing Bob to Bob in giving this 4 stars.<br />Anyone who thinks that Bob can't sing ought to listen to this album. His voice is soothing and soft.<br />This album's a keeper. I'll be listening to this for a long time.
B00062PN6I|2.0|If your ears are sensitive, you shouldn't buy these.  I read the reviews and thought I would be okay but I knew my ears were sensitive.

B00DCRE7M0|2.0|I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO LA BRIE SINCE  \\" IMAGES AND WORDS \\" FIRST CAME OUT. I'VE COME TO KNOW WHAT STYLE SEEMS TO FIT LA BRIE'S VOICE. \\" ELEMENTS OF PERSUASION\\" WAS A DAMN GOOD CD. THE SONGWRITING WAS VARIED, INTERESTING, AND THE LYRICS WERE NOT CHEESY. THIS CD HAS NONE OF THOSE CHARACTERISTICS. THE MUSIC IS GOOD, BUT THE DEATH METAL SCREAMING SUCKS AND SHOULD BE LEFT TO \\"DISTURBED\\" OR SOME OTHER BAND IN THEIR SAME MUSIC GENRE. I HOLD LA BRIE TO A MUCH HIGHER STANDARD.NOT IMPRESSED, LISTENED TO IT TWICE. THAT'S ALL IT WILL GET. BUMMER!

B00571F26Y|5.0|Best book I've ever read!!!!  I learned so much from this book!  It changed my life forever.  This is a must read book for anyone who wants to know the truth and have things explained so it all makes perfect sense.<br />I have recommended this book to all my friends and they have bought it, too.  I greatly appreciate my nutritionist telling me about this book.  I couldn't put it down.  It has made an enormous difference in my life, my health, and weight, and my happiness. God bless Dr. William Davis for his hard work.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I love this movie, even though it does get a bit cheesy in some parts. I love the way marvel set this movie up, forcing you(well, not really FORCING, it was enjoyable)to watch several different movies to even get what was going on in this one....but it worked out very well and well worth the gleefully wasted hours getting to this point. A great movie with great acting and a so-so script, which thankfully worked out great in the end :-)
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I loved the writing of was easy to read and the era was displayed beautifully the only thing that I was disappointed with was the end I wanted Eleanor and park to stay together I still think that this book is a awesome quick read that is one of the best love stories I have read in a while.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I like the overall packaging of these three great movies, with nice artwork, extra's discs with  lots of good footage to watch, and a really nice quality about the whole production that I honestly wasn't expecting for the price. This is the one to get if the Dark Knight Trilogy floats your boat, it's worth it and then some :-)
B000TEMQNG|5.0|I love the Bowie. All the Bowie. But I am in real love with this particular album/music. Width of a Circle - brilliant. Can't improve on brilliant. Bowie fans, if  you don't own this... it's like missing the cake with your frosting.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|I totally binged on the four seasons of Goodwife, I'd knock off four or five episodes a day, even paid for a couple on season four before they went prime.  What is wrong with my life (don't answer it's rhetorical)?<br /><br />I know it's not all that great (some acquaintances have let slip with &#34;trite&#34;) but I'm enamoured of Alicia, where is she going to end up, will she stray from &#34;the straight and narrow&#34;.<br /><br />I apologize, I can't help it.<br /><br />Where is season five??!!??
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I read The Eye of the World way back in 1990 and have followed Jordan and this great cast of characters ever since. Mr Sanderson gets high praise for stepping into a difficult situation and taking the series home.  I find myself now wanting to go back to the beginning and rejoin these characters in the Two Rivers and experience the adventure all over again.
B00130EVSS|5.0|What can be said about this movie, Wow, Cronenberg at his greatest.<br /><br />Every shot is like Hitchcock to the nth.  Pervading menace seeps from every frame, everything (and I mean everything)is just a teensy weensy bit off kilter.  An undertone of dread leaks in around the edges, seeps through each pixel.<br /><br />It is  the human condition and for that I am eternally grateful.<br /><br />p.s.  Amazon, shame on you, this should be captioned, as should every video in your library. Shame, Shame, Shame.

0345803485|2.0|Oh, my!  Or as Anastasia Steele would say - jeez, holy crap, crap, and double crap!  I must confess, looking at the popularity of this thing, in a moment of personal weakness, my curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to read it.  Now, how to get it out of my brain?  Jeez, it's like walking in on your parents' having sex.  I can't bring myself to write a review of it, since all I want to do is burn it out of my brain.  Jeez, I'd better make an appointment with Dr. Flynn, but seeing as how this shrink hasn't done too well with Christian Grey, I think I'd better come up with a better option.  I know - I'll call Men in Black and get them to use that `flasher thingy thing' on me.<br /><br />Probably the most annoying thing for me was not the overblown sex scenes, but was how often Anastasia says `jeez,' sounding like a twelve-year-old.  I had thoughts of Theodore Cleaver in Leave It to Beaver saying, \\"Jeez, Wally, mom always lets you do stuff I don't get to do.\\"  This is a strange thought to have when the book you're reading is an erotic romance.<br /><br />Okay, so why did I keep reading?  I had read some of the reviews that said it had a surprise ending.  Jeez, it was no surprise to me.  Actually, if she had done anything else, now that would have been a surprise.<br />[[ASIN:1934759252 Rendezvous Rock]]

B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Everything the critics promised.  Trust the Brits to deliver a great, hold your interest, mystery. Chock full of pathos and just enough red herrings to keep you guessing. Don't be put off by the quirkiness of the two detectives, British writers paint their main characters as flawed, everyday humans unlike the American chiseled body, squared jawed  matinee idol, whose flaws are for effect: rumpled clothes, beat up wheels, one job short of receivership.
B0012NO316|5.0|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a showcase for some of the sharpest, most intense, brutal, electrifying and vicious acting ever seen on the screen. [[ASIN:B000LJ851Q Elizabeth Taylor]] chews up the scenery with her savage verbal attacks on everyone around her in a self-destructive path that reveals some dark secrets along the way. Taylor's performance as Martha won her a much-deserved Oscar, and you'd be hard pressed to find a more brilliant, hilarious, intense, or emotional performance in cinema.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00007G1WH Richard Burton]] burns with quiet intensity that boils over at climactic moments. One moment his George is a henpecked husband, the other a manipulating, conniving, deliciously evil attacker. The other half of the film's cast - George Segal and Sandy Dennis, know they can't out-act Liz and Dick and their razor-sharp scrapping, so wisely, they under-act. George Segal is the everyman, thrust into an impossibly awkward situation, and Sandy Dennis (in another Oscar-winning performance) plays his \\"slim-hipped\\" wife - a sounding board for the fury building between George and Martha.<br /><br />The dialogue is still razor-sharp and utterly perfect, with impossibly harsh profanity for it's day. Elizabeth Taylor was possibly the most beautiful woman alive circa the time of the film, but here Taylor chose to be seen as a un-glamoured, frumpy, annoying, lewd floozy. The cinematography is stark and the sets minimal but realistic - putting the focus on the actors. The score is excellent and the editing to die for.<br /><br />The real focus on here, however, is on four brilliant actors. They always hold our attention, play with our emotions, keep us riveted, enthralled, disgusted, and squirming in our seats. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a movie like they don't make them anymore, but it never feels like a \\"classic\\",and to this day remains relevant, fresh, funny, and emotionally devastating. Five Stars.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|While other young children may have been brought up going to the library, I learned how to read by reading comic books.<br />My favorites were the Avengers, Superman, Batman,Wonder Woman, Fantastic 4, X Men. I was too old by the time the cartoon series to appreciate them. However, old enought to appreciate the movie versions and some TV versions of these characters.<br />The Avengers and well done.  It is enjoyable and it is true to personalities of these characters. They were not the perfect heroes. However as a child I appreciated the stories of these people who were not that well accepted by others were able to join forces to protect the masses.  Marvel's Avengers does a good job of updating their foes.  Their characters are respected and theirs foes updated. Great enjoyment.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love it it always has fun stuff to guess I love to get on and play cause I love it
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am very pleased with this item.  I gave it to my 7 yr old granddaughter for her Kindle Fire, and without that case, I'm sure her Kindle would have been broken by now.  It takes a lot of abuse from her and it does what it's suppose to do, protects her Kindle.  I even bought one for myself in black and I love mine.  You don't have to bother turning your Kindle on and off.  You just open or close the case.  I recommend this product.
0142180300|5.0|Well written, well paced.  Dr. Carroll explains very esoteric material in very clear and simple ways - a sign of real understanding.  Good on the science, the history, the personalities involved and most of all the significance.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This season is suspenseful, yet still a reflection of reality with a dose a romantic drama. Best season thus far.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love the stars and the story lines.  Wish it were on a different channel.  I hate waiting for CBS to finish their Sunday afternoon sports to put on their Sunday night shows.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The subject matter was something that I was not aware of until I delved into the book, and it happened in my area of the country.  It was very well written with a shifting between early 1900s and present day. The two main characters' friendship was fascinating because they gave each other so much in unexpected ways.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Very good CD for any Sabbath lover.  It brings back some of the original sabbath sounds on several of the songs.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|i went into this with no expectations. i figured a low budget, poor acting halo movie release. i wasn't even sure if live action or not.<br /><br />This is live action, the character development of the main character was decent, the acting was excellent, emotions felt real, nonverbal scenes were very well played out. Master Chief was awesome!<br /><br />if you want spoilers basically it follows the life of a few highly privileged kids who are in military academy on some remote world. They are learning to work together as a team. the main character reminisces on his brother who died in combat. team conflicts are played out with a brief exploration of romance. unaware there is a fight against an alien race (they think just against rebel armies) they are invaded by the Covenant who tries to exterminate everyone on the base. The kids fight hopelessly and are rescued at the last minute by Master Chief and lead on a fight towards the pickup point. There is death and tragedy. This tugs at your heartstrings. This movie was real, it was fun, it was exciting, it was suspenseful.<br /><br />It was awesome. especially if you already like the halo series stories in general. highly recommend.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Similar to alot of the end of the world type of movies although it was done alright. It was alright

0156027321|4.0|I decided to read this book after watching the movie. I've now read this book three times and I've ended up finding new meaning and depth everytime.<br /><br />The first time I read it, I thought it was a survival story with a crazy twist at the end. The second time, it was a story about what makes us human. The third time, it was a book about religion.<br /><br />Pi's journey is beautiful, captivating, and enlighting all at the same time. I would recommend this book for anyone who loves thought-provoking literature.

0345803485|4.0|I had heard numerous friends talk about this book.  Mostly stating how embarrassed they were and really didn't want people to know they were reading it.<br />I found this book more than I expected.  The love story is riveting.  I fell in love with Christian.  And found Anastasia a friend and someone I could identify with.<br />I hated ending this book and looked forward to the next.<br />I only wish I could believe there are men out there like Christian.  He is the ultimate lover, not that I could get into bondage, but his need to &#34;make love&#34; to Ana.  His care in this is something I wish more men could understand.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It is an entertaining book. I had seen the movie first, and now note the movie follows the book reasonably well, but without some of the detail of daily life aboard a small raft with a live 450lb predator.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read.

B00280LYIC|4.0|Had to find out why so many young people had told me they loved these books.  At first, I thought it was childish, but appreciated the humor and tongue-in-cheek comments.  Then I got hooked and had to finish it.  I love the fact that young readers are learning about ancient history and myths in a pleasant and current way.
B00006JDVV|4.0|A very interesting story, with certain plot weaknesses, but nonetheless very enjoyable.  The sequences with the dragons were good, although there could have been more of them.  The idea of simply hiding out from the dragons, would not work. In their search for food, the dragons would find and root these people out.  Also, the idea that a human group could fly thousands of miles, through dragon infested territory, without major disasters befalling them, is a stretch.  At times, the plot flows very slowly, this group hiding out, would eventually have to confront their nemesis.  All in all an entertaining film, good special effects, could have done with less talk, and more action.  But as a fantasy film, it works,  If one just shuts out the obvious plot weaknesses, I for one am happy with this purchase.  JRV
8866137510|5.0|I had the 2013 Le Petit Prince Pocket Calendar and loved it.  I searched high and low for a calendar notebook like this.  It fits nicely in my purse, enough room to make notes and calendar items, extremely sturdy, the pages lay flat nicely for writing purposes.  I wasn't sure about the 2014 one - not a big fan of white - but upon receiving it, I was glad I decided to go with this notebook again.  It has the same quality, style, and function as my 2013 book.

I did not know what to expect with this new album because Brian always says with each new album they want to do something completely different from what they did previously, and I liked \\"Battle for the Sun\\" so much I didn't want anything different!  Well boys, like I said, \\"Placebo continues to impress\\"! LOVE the new album - just wish there were more songs; 10 songs just isn't enough! What can I say?  I'm a junky!

B0006ZE7G2|5.0|There are many out there who equate Pink Floyd and anything that they do or write as \\"stoner music\\" or cop out and say \\"you have to be on drugs to understand it\\".<br /><br />The hubris of the small minded, I say.  It is fairly easy to understand \\"The Wall\\", all you need is an open mind and empathy to understand it.<br /><br />The story of which is about a rocker, named Pink, who is slowly losing his mind.  Through the course of the film we track through his mind, his memories, his nightmares.  All stemming from the loss of his father in World War 2, a smothering mother, an atrocious teacher, horrid classmates and on through blinding musical success and then, the final brick in the wall, the breaking of his heart by an unfaithful wife.  Each one creating a brick upon brick in the wall that separates him from his fans, his friends and the rest of the world.  A psychological defense from a cruel and unemphatic world until at last he becomes a dictator in his own mind, one that is as cruel, malicious and heartless as the world that had hurt him.  Finally, he let's slip his emotions in front of a total stranger and thus sets himself on trial for showing his humanity when he's already isolated himself from humanity.<br /><br />All in all, it's a very multiple layered, beautifully written, frightening and enjoyable experience for both a movie lover and a music lover.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|First off: I promise, NO SPOILERS. I apologize if there is some vagueness as a result.<br /><br />I'd like to write two reviews for Dr. Sleep: one on its stand-alone merits, and as a continuation of the story of the Shining, and one on its success as a continuation of the brilliance of The Shining. I'd give the first 5 stars, but the second only...3. Which is unfair, I guess, especially in light of Stephen King's afterward (\\"...people change. The man who wrote Doctor Sleep is very different from the well-meaning alcoholic who wrote The Shining, but both remain interested in the same thing: telling a kickass story. I enjoyed finding Danny Torrance again and following his adventures. I hope you did, too. If that's the case, Constant Reader, we're all good.\\")--which seems to say that my first 5 star review is the one King would care about, if I were to presume he cares what I have to say. And since I love Stephen King, that's what I gave it, officially, and that's the one I'll start with.<br /><br />This book is SUCH a fun read! The best kind of King book, the kind that leaves you hungover in the morning because you were up much too late reading, and almost makes you miss your bus to work because you get engrossed in it again while you brush your teeth. Several times I got a big giddy grin on my face and even laughed aloud with ridiculous delight at a super stephenkingy turn of phrase, words I imagined gave him a similar satisfaction as they left his fingers for the page. Some of these were even scary-creepy things, but they were so perfectly done, they were thrilling on that second level, too. It felt to me like King had a lot of fun with a lot of this book, just reveling in his own GoodAtItNess, long passages spooling out with gleeful sprezzatura.<br /><br />The story runs smoothly along, suspenseful questions answered with perfect timing, never leaving so much unknown at once that the complications are impossible to follow. The central characters are excellent. Grownup Dan surprisingly unlike 5 year old Dan in the way my own grownup children are surprisingly unlike their 5 year old selves--something of the little boy remains, but he didn't just stretch to man-size, he's a fully realized person, very changed.  Abra is a great character on her own, and her relationships with Dan, her parents, and her friends, are all truthful and nuanced. Good on whoever talked King through the markers of early adolescent girlness that pepper her believability.  The scary creepy horrors are scary, creepy, and horrible; turning off the light when I finally forced myself every night was just as unpleasant as it had been when I read The Shining.<br /><br />Loose strings of the original plot are nicely knotted up.  I'd have maybe liked to know more about  Wendy, but real grown men--as Dan is, in this novel--don't have the kind of insight or, frankly, interest, in their mothers' inner lives. Even if they're psychic. So it works, as a function of Grownup Dan being well done. Less likely, I thought, was the way Dick was written out of Dan's life, but I have to admit that works too, in the sense that Dan grew up in ways that were unpredictable when he was five. Expository backstory from the first book doesn't get the clumsy treatment it normally does in sequels, but is dropped in usefully and gracefully throughout the plot. It was very satisfying to have some things I thought I understood about the Overlook, and Dan, and Jack, confirmed, and equally satisfying to have some new details mixed in to deepen and thicken that foundation of the story.  The final revisitation from The Shining gets a muted, subtle treatment in the narrative, and I hope it's not just sentimental over-imagination on my part to think King let it be so simple because it might have been unbearably moving otherwise.<br /><br />Five stars! Buy it, read it, you'll enjoy it!<br /><br />Now then. The Shining is one of my all-time favorite books. It's the one I wax rhapsodic about when I'mmaking an obnoxiously over-thought case for Stephen King as an underrated capital G genius of American capital L literature.  It's the one I compare to Dickens and the one I compare to Steinbeck and the one I say doesn't need to lean on those comparisons because it's capital G greatness all by itself. I like to make people listen to me say that the only reason The Shining is not a genuine masterpiece, recognized or not, is that King was young and still growing as a writer. And still not so market-proven that his (now routinely over-indulgent) editors gave him free reign. I have always assumed those factors caused the flaws (I apologize for my cheek, Mr. King; I know I'm unworthy, but for lack of a better, more obsequious term, I have to go with flaws) in The Shining, and I was unrestrainedly thrilled to hear a sequel unaffected by those was in the works. I refused to entertain fears that I wouldn't like it as much as the original, the way absolutely everyone likes the sequel less than the original; when the first reviews came out and I read that Barbara Kingsolver loved Dr. Sleep, I went directly to Kindle, did not pass go, and Amazon collected my seven dollars.  And it was, as I've already said, money well and unregrettedly spent.<br /><br />But this book isn't anything like The Shining. Not as a literary feat. Both books tell, as King says he intended, kickass stories. The Shining, though, spent its first half telling a fascinatingly ambiguous story, too. The Shining is about a man with demons we all recognize, and a lot of us live with intimately. For a good chunk of the beginning of the book, it is impossible to determine from the text alone whether or not those demons are the only demons in the Torrance family's life. The interplay between Jack and his family and the things in Jack's head is fantastic, and the aforementioned flaw is that the transition between \\"Is This Real or Is Jack Just Crazy\\" to \\"Oh, yeah, it's real. Jack's crazy, too, but that's secondary\\" is less smoothly done than the writing on either side of the divide. And Dr. Sleep has nothing at all like that. The kickass story is all out in the open and straightforwardly linear, as is the development of all the characters and the reader's understanding of who they are and what they're doing.<br /><br />Dr. Sleep is extragood pop culture writing. The Shining was that, with unrecognized actual literature icing its cake.

B00A285OOW|5.0|Well-written; seemingly well-researched with a tad of license and very human.<br /><br />As PhD in history, I used to be more of a purist about the way history is written, but let's be honest -- much of what we know of recorded history is largely by those who could write, and scholars which historically were men.  Philippa Gregory does a great job bringing the women into history, and is frank about where she knows absolute facts, and where a little creativity comes in.  Altogether entirely captivating. No wonder the BBC adapted 10 part films were so good.

B00881VLCE|5.0|I have to say that I was skeptical about using a tablet for jigsaw puzzles, and then trying a free app. But I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Unobtrusive ads, beautiful puzzles ( many of which are free to download), offers various levels of difficulty. Even allows you to save your puzzles as pictures to your device. Keeps individual pieces organized off to the side while working  and locks pieces into place once in the correct spot. Relaxing music in the background, just a nice app. A must have!
B00A9ET4MC|2.0|I was impressed by the jacket blurb on Adichie, the awards and acclamations, and wanted to learn something more on the African experience, so I picked up this book.<br />At first I was not disappointed. This is a story of two Nigerian teenagers, Ifemelu and Obinze, their love affair while still in school in Lagos, and the trial of their separation, Ifemelu going on to study in America and Obinze to work in Britain. The rift lasts thirteen years, Ifemelu finding other loves and a career as a blogger in the US, while Obinze fails to make it in the UK and returns to Lagos to finally become a success in business and start a family. When Ifemelu finds her life in America unfulfilled she returns to Lagos, partly to rekindle the flames of her teenage love.<br />The story is very beautifully written and I can see why the author has gained many fans with her easy style, accomplished but never too literary, rich with description and dialect to add authenticity. The reader gains an insight into everyday life in a bustling African capitol, the challenges of the third world immigrant both in Britain and the USA, and the complexities of the black experience in America, even as to the election of Barack Obama. The author painstakingly points out, again and again, how color prejudice is ingrained into our way  of life in America, how insidious it is, permeating our language, the media, the workplace, how damaging it can be, how people can hurt even in the very act of trying not to be prejudiced.<br />Unfortunately, it is the plot device that ultimately brings this book down. Ifemelu decides to write a blog, called \\"Raceteenth or Various Observations About American Blacks (Those Formerly Known as Negroes) by a Non-American Black\\". This takes the form of a racially aware, consciousness-raising diary of her experiences in the US. To achieve this, she plays the passive role of observer and critic in nearly every scene and the whole story seems to unfurl in front of her eyes as though it were a dream (and a nightmare). However, she seems unable to do anything but criticise, we never hear about her doing anything positive. The one time she thinks about being nice, a favor for a fellow immigrant who works in a hair salon, it would have been a brilliant act of kindness, but she never follows through. In her blog she outlines an algorithm to determine one's position on the scale of the racially oppressive. Turns out it doesn't matter if you're red, yellow, or brown, as long as you're not black you have no right to protest innocence! Meanwhile, back in Nigeria her circle of friends seem to be equally trite, superficial and insensitive to each other (not to mention criminally bent) but it's so good to be back home...there's no racism in Nigeria!<br />Ultimately, it's very hard to like a book in which the main character is so judgmental.t were a dream (and a nightmare).

B00A83075M|5.0|My last review of a Disney animation feature (\\"Brave\\") trashed the movie for very poor story telling.  (In \\"Brave\\", the ostensible heroine of the story, Princess Merida, does nothing brave or virtuous to try to correct the mess she has created.)  In \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" Disney makes a 180 degree turn: the \\"hero\\" Ralph puts his own life at risk to correct the mess he created.  \\"WIR\\" has all of the elements of great story telling - self-sacrifice, friendship, overcoming diversity (Vanellope uses her \\"glitch\\" disability to save Ralph from certain death), and so on.  Call me Pollyanna, but in my opinion, in order for the public to love a story, the characters should discover within themselves these virtues.  (Think \\"Finding Nemo\\" or \\"Ratatouille\\".)  Hopefully \\"WIR\\" will be a wake-up call to Disney to produce new animated films (and not just sequels of past glories) with good story telling along the lines of \\"WIR\\".<br /><br />The animation is superb.  I particularly like the way that \\"old\\" video game characters (such as Tapper (the bartender) and Gene (one of the inhabitants of Ralph's game)) are animated with non-fluid motions.<br /><br />While \\"WIR\\" includes numerous nods to various video games over the last 30 years (which gaming aficionados will no doubt enjoy), having a lack of familiarity with these games (as do I) does not detract from the story.<br /><br />Beyond good story telling, the story line is solid - no \\"glitches\\" here.

158270208X|5.0|I won two big prizes in my state lottery through the use of gratitude and the Law of Attraction, so I know the power of gratitude firsthand! This book is not only beautiful, but it contains a lot of powerful information that can help anyone harness the power of the Law of Attraction. Gratitude works because we get more of what we focus on. If we focus on what is good, then we get more of that through the use of our feelings and expectation. I would definitely suggest this book to anyone wanting to speed up the manifestation process.

B005PK57NU|5.0|What an engrossing series.  I have been binge watching and can't watch just one at a time...it's that good.  In addition to the weekly procedural there is an on going thread of intrigue involving Alicia - The Good WIfe - and her straying husband, as well as twists and turns involving the law firm she works for.  Many previous adversaries and aquaintenances are brought back through different episodes creating a great family of characters.  Wonderful guest stars , Michael J Fox, Brian Denehey and many others, return from time to time. Just great TV.

0307743659|5.0|More than 25 years after its original publication (and more than a decade since I last read it), The Shining still more than holds its own as one of the scariest books Stephen King has ever written - and when you have a body of work like King does, that's no small accomplishment. The horrors within the Overlook have lost none of their intensity over the years, and King does a beautiful job slowly immersing the reader in that world, letting the pressure build until all hell breaks loose. But what strikes me more on this read is that the heart of The Shining isn't the Overlook - it's the family that's staying there, and especially the mind of Jack Torrance. Reading The Shining once you have a wife and child is a wholly different experience, and King's evocation of a frustrated man who both feels utterly trapped by his family and yet loves them unconditionally is brilliant - a depiction that both makes Jack deeply flawed and yet completely understandable. More than that, though, King's pacing is beautifully handled. Just as he would do years later in the short story \\"1408,\\" King perfectly times out Torrance's gradual breakdown, handling it so subtly that his unthinkable choices over the course of the book seem logical, if not even understandable. A book that had any of those elements - the flawed father, the mental breakdown, the horror-filled hotel - would be a good read. But a book that pulls together all of those elements, and interweaves them so gracefully while letting each one illuminate and underline the others...well, a book like that would be a great book. And make no mistake, The Shining is a great novel, one that's both chilling beyond belief and utterly, completely human at all times, and one that finds its greatest terrors in the combination of those two worlds.
B0076I624W|5.0|Enjoyed this movie!  Acting was superb and was expected with stars like Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.<br />Great story with some wonderful special effects.  It is a keeper and I'm sure we will watch it often.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Writing sequels is challenging under the best of circumstances. But writing a sequel nearly 35 years after the fact to one of your most beloved novels? That's some nearly insurmountable expectations and hopes to deal with. And to be sure, Doctor Sleep can't really live up to The Shining. But what's disappointing is that it's not entirely successful as its own book, either. Doctor Sleep does a great job filling us in on the life of Danny Torrance and what's happened to him in the years since his time at the Overlook, and much of what works about Doctor Sleep arises from the way King shows us both the scars that Danny's past has left on him while still letting him develop into a very different man from his father. All of that is solid work, but as Doctor Sleep gets into its plot, it loses a lot of its way. Early on in the novel, King tosses in a nice nod to his son Joe Hill's phenomenal horror novel NOS4A2, and while that's a great moment, it ended up making me realize just how much Doctor Sleep and NOS4A2 have in common...and, more tellingly, how much better NOS4A2 is at telling that story than Doctor Sleep is. Yes, King is still phenomenal at the quieter moments of his story - look, for instance, at his superb grasp of Danny's new job at a hospice, where his talent helps him to help others to find peace in their dying moments. Those scenes are beautiful and profound, as are the many scenes that King focuses on his characters and the moments that made up their lives. But the overall plot of Doctor Sleep - which involves a tribe of psychic vampires (more or less) who have targeted a young girl that Danny has taken under his wing - ends up never being as involving or as interesting as you would think it is; even worse, considering this is a sequel to The Shining, it's never really all that scary. Is Doctor Sleep worth reading if you're curious about what became of Danny Torrance, or to get your King fix? Sure. But if you're expecting another great read that's part of King's return to form (to say nothing of anything close to The Shining)...well, you may come away a bit disappointed.ing's return to form (to say nothing of anything close to The Shining)...well, you may come away a bit disappointed.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|This works very well and is very easy to use.<br />Great things include: multiple alarms, wide range of alarm sound choices including your own music library, general ease of use.<br />Some improvements could be made. The display dimming feature doesn't allow sufficient dimming. If you set it up on a nightstand it's like having a searchlight shine on you. (Solution close the cover, but it would be nice to be able to see what time it is.) The weather display could have a larger font (and the reported outside temperature can be 5 degrees(F) off).

B0047WJ12K|5.0|I loved this flick!  Fast-paced, thrilling and well-acted.  Of course, it is far-fetched and somewhat confusing at times, but, if you stick with it, it turns out to be a fun ride.  Leonardo DiCaprio always, in my opinion, gives a great performance.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is, also, very good.

B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was a beautiful mix of history and modern-day. The entwining of characters was flawless. The books takes you back to a time where America was the land of dreams, yet the struggles were often worse than where many were coming from. The heart wrenching past of both characters leaves you longing to know more & sad when you reach the last page. One of the best books I've read in a long time!

B004UPANGM|5.0|This movie is one of the best examples of campy B horror fliks of all time. Bruce Campbell is one of the best physical comedic actors of all times rivaling the classic comedy of Jerry Lewis, the 3 Stooges or Laurel and Hardy. If you like your horror with an amusing twist, you will LOVE this film. There is a reason this movie became a camp classic with a solid base of devoted fans. If you haven't seen it, you must!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Usually I don't write reviews but I see a lot of bad reviews on this from people that are not using it as intended it does what google advertises it will do, it's working fine for me playing you tube, hulu plus, netflix even amazon prime on chrome browser, at 35.00 it's a steal the cheapest way to cut the cord!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|1/21/14 Update -<br />I am changing my rating from 1 star to 2 because Google has apparently tried its hardest to overcome DRM hobbling (within the overlord whims of the Bar Association's despotic \\"case law\\") by enabling streaming from personal devices to Chromecast via RealPlayer Cloud. The effect of this indirect DRM circumvention does not work very well (inconsistent reliability, and only streams small files unless you first upload them to RealCloud), but I will happily grant one additional star for this effort.<br /><br />It is relevant to ask, however, if a small company like Real can enable us to stream videos from our personal devices to television monitors through Chromecast, why cannot a big company like Google do it? Nobody doubts adding the unnecessary detour of RealCloud slows playback. Why not skip it, letting users stream in the fastest and most direct manner possible? For me, the answer is obvious, Google is a big juicy target for DRM lawsuits. Google apparently does not dare to do what Real dares, standing its ground against obsolete DRM middlemen and their corrupt Bar Association lawyers, judges and politicians. Yet I am sure we can agree, \\"Don't be evil\\" requires taking a stand before acquiescing to that which is personally repugnant  [...]. I call upon members of the Google corporation to do what they personally know is right, and not let the corporate machine override their humanity.<br /><br />10/4/13 Original (One star) Review -<br />Digital Rights Management (DRM) is loaded on this device. DRM makes users jump through hoops and hobbles Chromecast's best features. For example, the DRM on Chromecast determines any SD card to be a threat it cannot control, so it prevents the user from playing music on the phone or tablet through Chromecast until the SD card is removed. Worse, Chromecast does not tell you what the problem is or how to fix it (probably because \\"Remove your SD card and jump though a dozen other DRM hoops to make Chromecast work\\" sounds a little absurd). Instead, you get the cryptic message, \\"Playback error -- Unable to play the song. Can't play a sideloaded song remotely.\\"<br /><br />If you google that message, you run into a dozen forums with hundreds of people, each who have a different fix that works for them on their particular setup. By massaging DRM just right, it is possible to get Chromecast to work, but probably not with an SD card because DRM has not figured out how to make anything useful also safe for \\"intellectual property\\" corporations (and never will for the fairly obvious reason that innovation is at odds with DRM control).<br /><br />None of this is google's fault. Without DRM, Chromecast would be an awesome device, but with DRM, the best features of Chromecast are virtually unusable.stead, you get the cryptic message, \\"Playback error -- Unable to play the song.

After watching the movie again on cable, I started to appreciate the little scenes more and more and really was impressed by how well designed the sets were and the clothing. Of course Radcliffs performance was well done.  Too bad he's so small...he still looks like a kid.  No matter, I recommend this movie and I'm buying the BluRay.

B00DHHWYAW|4.0|I would have given it a 5 star, but it is so much like the first movie except  I miss Robert Redford for Gatsby.  Leonardo DiCaprio makes a good Gatsby also, I just think Robert Redford was better.  The story was great and the photography was beautiful.  The costumes and effects were great!  Worth your money, especially for the 3D.  A beautiful movie and great Cinematography!
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|Danielle does a fine job of curating Persuasion research from numerous academic sources.<br />I think a book like this would be even better if it would come from the perspective of someone who is also in a lifelong sales job. Citing several studies in various settings of research done with undergraduate students and then assuming that such principles hold in every day life, can be a little thin. Even with it being a little thin however, it definitely provided food for thought.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I got this movie because it was 3D and I do like the Star Trek movies.  I was not disappointed. As usual, the new 3D just makes an already good movie better.  The price was also fantastic for a 3D movie and my Prime shipping gets it to me so fast.  Another family night movie hit.

B00D7NWTSI|4.0|The movie was great, I read some say they didn't like this movie because Iron Man wasn't his usual character and not in action shots as much.  I beg to disagree, he was in all the Iron Man shots...true he had allot of remote Iron Men...but the story was very good and I enjoyed it allot.  We watched this on movie night with my extended family of all ages, everyone enjoyed it, only one didn't because she does not like action movies at all.  She actually did not watch the movie.  I won't be a spoiler, but I liked the story line to this movie even better than the first 2.  The 3D was very good also and done great!  I think the 3D just adds to the movie experience.  It's like all good 3D movies, enough 3D effects to give you the 3D enhancement without the headache that earlier over the top movies did.  It was just right, enough into the room without upsetting your vision.  I have an LG 3D TV so the glasses are so light that you even forget you have them on.  I actually have to make sure everyone removes them after the show and doesn't leave with my glasses.

B00BS1VVIU|5.0|This is the saddest, most depressing album I've ever heard in my life. That isn't to say that it's not good because it really, really is. The songs are beautiful and moving and heartfelt. The vocals and lyrics are gorgeous. But know, there isn't a happy song in the bunch. Some of the tracks are upbeat but it's a trick. Poppy tune for lyrics about how someone she adored cheated on her or how underneath it all she's a human and she's dying here. I hope people buy this because, truly, every single song is terrific, it's great music. But it will make you cry.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Wonderful performances by an ensemble cast.These young performers are so very talented.<br />A real joy to watch them perform.No dubbing or lip syncing here. This is the real deal.<br />I predict that these young performers will go far in their  careers.<br />Hopefully appearing in Smash will give a much need leg up.

B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Despite the predictable plot points as the story progresses, Steelheart offers us a chance to see superheroes being not so heroic. Sanderson offers up a protagonist that unwittingly attempts to unravel the psychology of the Epics(in text reference to supers), which often is more interesting than the plot. Still, Steelheart is a good rainy day read.<br /><br />A must for superhero fans, but enjoyable for the rest.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Ice age village is very fast paced and interesting . The graphics presentation of this game makes it very enjoyable to play.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|My husband and are addicted to this show. Can’t wait to watch season 5 when it’s released through Amazon Prime.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Good one. Held my interest all the way to end.  Better gramar and editing. Would like to see more &#34;Reacher Rules&#34; sprinkled through.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book was ok, but did not hold my attention like his other books did. The changes in setting, time period and characters didn't flow very well. Some characters were developed so greatly and then they had no real place in the story. It seemed odd and not at all like his other work. I enjoyed the last chapter the most. Our book club will meet Monday to discuss it, I can't wait to hear what the others thought about it.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|I'd rate this 4.5 stars, but I'm a sap.<br /><br />This was such a sweet book. And I don't mean that in a derogatory way--this book kept me smiling and, clichéd as it may sound, warmed my heart.<br /><br />Don Tillman is a genetics professor in Australia with social and behavioral tendencies that fans of The Big Bang Theory would find immensely familiar to those of Sheldon Cooper. Bullied as a child, he made the decision to live life as the class clown, so his (often unconscious) way of acting and reacting makes people laugh rather than question why he acts the way he acts. And while he enjoys his perfectly regimented life, with its Standardized Meal System (he eats the same thing on the same days each week) and its down-to-the-minute scheduling of exercise, sleep, shopping, and work, there is one problem. Despite having close friends Gene and Claudia nearby, Don is lonely.<br /><br />\\"I am thirty-nine years old, tall, fit, and intelligent, with a relatively high status and above-average income as an associate professor. Logically, I should be attractive to a wide range of women. In the animal kingdom, I would succeed in reproducing. However, there is something about me that women find unappealing. I have never found it easy to make friends, and it seems that the deficiencies that caused this problem have also affected my attempts at romantic relationships.\\"<br /><br />Don has tried dating women, and many of those attempts have been, well, less than successful, leading to anecdotes he refers to as \\"The Apricot Ice Cream Disaster,\\" for one. So he does what any other genetics professor would do--launches The Wife Project, complete with a 16-page, scientifically valid survey to filter out the drinkers, the smokers, the late arrivers, and those who might cause a reprise of The Apricot Ice Cream Disaster.<br /><br />When Don meets Rosie Jarman, a beautiful bartender who smokes and arrives late, he knows immediately that she's not suitable for The Wife Project. But he'skeen on helping her identify who her biological father is, since he has access to his university's lab to run DNA tests, and he has no shortage of plausible (and not so plausible) ways to retrieve DNA from potential candidates. And suddenly, Don realizes how much he enjoys spending time with Rosie, despite the fact he has no interest in her as a partner, and that she keeps causing him to veer away from his perfectly scheduled routine.<br /><br />Even though The Rosie Project is fairly predictable, Don and Rosie's characters are so charming, so enjoyable, you want to keep reading their story. And while some of Don's behaviors may seem outlandish, again, if you've ever watched Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, you'll realize they're not quite as outlandish as you think. This book made me chuckle, laugh at times, and just kept me smiling throughout. Apparently the book has already been adapted into a movie in Australia, and it definitely seems screen-worthy.<br /><br />Love cannot be controlled, and it is rarely, if ever, predictable. And neither are people. The Rosie Project is a tremendously enjoyable book that makes those facts immensely compelling.
B0000268M6|5.0|I am new to Einaudi, just discovered him while watching a wonderful French film called The In-touchables, so decide to try this CD as well as In A Time Lapse.  Great choice -- I listen to this in my car constantly on the way to work or after a long day.  Worth every penny!
B0084B0656|5.0|I have always greatly admired Oswald Chambers for his unwavering devotion to God, but after reading this book, his wife is right there beside him in my estimation. Their view of life was to refuse to worry, take whatever God brought their way, and trust in Him to make it happen. I loved their commitment to hospitality, the way they took in stride with God's help some really rough things and their love for people. I aim to model my life after them in these areas. It is said that if God removed His Holy Spirit, many things Christians do would not change at all. After reading this book, I am convinced that the Holy Spirit's removal would have caused everything these 2 did to topple! I highly recommend this book!
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|I am now a confirmed Ludovico Einaudi fan.  Pick up this CD, you will not regret it.  HIs music is just wonderful, soaring, sometimes thoughtful, sometimes just joyful.  I enjoy this CD and highly recommend it as well as his &#34;Le Onde&#34; CD.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very nice!! Enjoy the alarm sound and bright numbers! Even give the weather in my area, waiting for tomorrow morning and see how alarm will sound to wake me up LoL  This works well with my kindle fire HD tablet and certainly worth the 99&cent;  Still trying to find a design for my clock!!
B00BR5KB4M|5.0|The book had entirely lived up to my high expectations.  It was a very entertaining read that I found hard to put down.  Being Chinese American, I had heard much about the book before and was glad to see that the book was able to meet the hype.  The reading was not very challenging and I will recommend it to my family, who I think will still greatly enjoy it even though their English is poor.  However, even though the reading comes along easily, the themes and material of the book can be very deep.  Certain stories of the book bring up important questions such as whether suicide is acceptable or how to react in an abusive relationship.  The book has also been made into an award winning film that I'm hoping to see as soon as I get the chance.  I have researched the author, Amy Tan, and it seems that her traits and history appear in many of the characters in the book, especially the daughter of the club's founder, Jing-Mei.  It seems that Amy has been successful overall and is recognized as a talented author.  This is hardly a surprise, considering how great The Joy Luck Club was.

B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|It was ok, finished book because I cant judt drop it once started.  Not impressed with ending.  Not what I expected
B001NHNG64|3.0|After the first Reacher book, I was hooked. I downloaded Die Trying, in hopes of immersing myself in this unique blend of hard-core action, logic and suspense. Boy, am I disappointed! The author has offered up only snippets of the old Jack Reacher, choosing to ladle endless pages of dreck about FBI pencil pushers having meetings, inter-departmental politics, blah, blah as page filler. I'll try to cherry-pick a few chapters.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|I wish it had more then one room to decorate  and more choses of décor for the But all in all I love the game..

B00338QENI|5.0|A great piece of work! Henrietta's family should be proud of her contribution even though she has not been fully recognized and her family has not been compensated! What and incredible journey we are taken on in this book!
B00CFNUMD0|4.0|Funny and brief escapades of Shaun and his flock, usually three episodes per 21-minute segment.  Stop-motion animation, with no dialogue but with very adequate sound expressions by the characters. I don't think you would want to watch two hours of it, but watching an occasional segment is a pleasant change of pace.  You'll find it worth at least a short peek.

B008YU0AOE|5.0|It has all the functionality that most people would need. And the layout makes it easy to use. I have yet to check it's accuracy and am taking it as a given for purposes of this review.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I got my first dose of minecraft on the pocket edition, because I didn't have a computer or an Xbox. I would suggest this game to anyone with a mobile device and 7 bucks to spare. Each of the world's is random,but my only complaints are the level size and the lack of weather. It needs more than 5 biomes, but I understand that there is only a limited amount of space for the game. It's great for fun, and I recommend it highly!
B0048WQDIE|5.0|The greatest book next to the Bible,  This is a rich and critical work of superhuman author:  Heller.  I've this book three times in my life, but this time I got the professional narration to go along with the book.  I must tell you it was reading Catch 22 on whole new level of enrichment of following the characters. I totally recommend this narration,  The person narrating changes his voice for each of the characters. YOU have read this giant work with the narration, 100% worth the price,

B00CM4VC7M|4.0|~Amazon's packaging was great, they put in an air bubble to keep the product from moving around inside the box. It prevented it from potentially getting damaged & I was grateful for that. Once I did open up the box the product was in mint condition no dents or scruffs on Sailor Moon's box.~<br />_____________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />---Packaging---<br />Sailor Moon's packaging is really pretty. It's colorful and eye catching I love that all the figures from the S.H. Figuarts line are imported from japan with minor changes to the American packaging. They just slap on the American logos of the figures perspective show & it's exactly what they did for Sailor Moon. Although it is small and almost unnoticeable, Bandai used the new Sailor Moon logo that we have seen in recent Sailor Moon merchandise at the bottom of the box. Since it is a japan import the box's lettering and the toy's instructions are in Japanese. Which isn't a problem since the toy is pretty much self explanatory.<br />(5/5)<br /><br />---The Figure--<br />~Visual~<br />The Sailor Moon figure looks nice over all, the paint application is flawless. I got lucky and I was delivered one with no paint issues. There is no paint chipping, no paint blots, no paint smudges, nor any off center paint applications. They got every little last detail of Sailor Moon's character design down to the tea. Even her accessories are very detailed & nicely painted. It blows my mind on how they fit so much small details on a fairly small figure. Her blonde hair is translucent at the tips of her bangs and the tips of her pigtails which is a nice touch to the figure. I do wish they did some sort of shading on her clothing and more shading on her hair. She stands at 5 1/2 inches tall which is smaller than most Figuarts which are usually 6inches. I guess it's due to the fact that Sailor Moon is a teenage girl & she will be in scale with the rest of the Sailor Senshi so her character is one of the shortest characters of the show. The body sculpt feels & it's sculpted exactly how it appears in the anime. Visually she is perfect & I am in love with this figures appearance.<br />(4/5)<br /><br />~Accessories~<br />She comes with interchangeable hands and faces. This specific figure that I received is the First Edition release so she came with the promised 2 bonus faces, the crying & the winking face with the standard release yelling facial expression, a focused expression, a battle ready expression without her tiara, & the default happy face expression. Changing the face on the figure at first I indeed had trouble, I had to pull off the bangs and face with careful but excessive force. I was afraid I was going to break the figure because she is small and petite the figure feels rather fragile in hand but once you do your first face swap it will become easier to interchange the faces. She comes with 10 hands total including the hand with her tiara as she gets ready to throw it at her enemies. Her hands are the easiest to interchange they stay on securely and nicely I had no issues with her hands. She also comes with the Moon Stick in two different versions. One without the silver crystal and one with the silver crystal which is an appreciated inclusion. She also comes with her furry little friend Luna the cat. Luna has some minor articulation as well, her tail and head can rotate. I don't find myself wishing they included something extra she comes with basically everything you need to get her into the iconic poses she is known to do & with her attack weapons from the show.<br />(5/5)<br /><br />~Articulation~<br />This figure is simply art at it's finest this isn't your typical toy purchase. S.H. Figuarts is known to make overly articulated & highly detailed show accurate figures so right off the bat you know you are paying for a high quality product. The description of these figures are and I quote \\"S.H.Figuarts is a new standard figure series that incorporates the Bandai action figure \\"Art\\" under the theme \\"Pursuing Character Expression through Humanoid Action.\\" So this beauty can definitely move like no other figure. The rest of her joints are very stiff and tight so you will have to move her joints around to loosen them up a bit. The only real trouble I encountered with her articulation is with her hair. Her hair's pigtails are on a ball joint so they are meant to be moved. The pigtails fell off when I took her out of the package. They are suppose to click in place but the left one simply does not go in at all and when it does go in it falls off again rather quickly. There is a defect inside of the hole where you put in her pigtail in the hair bun. There is a sculpted line inside the Odango bun or \\"meat balls\\" that prevent the pigtail from going in all the way and snapping back into place. The right pigtail is a different story it has caused me no issues what so ever and snaps into place just fine. I really wish Bandai put the pigtails in a ball peg with 2 two points of articulation so the hair can have more of a a wider range of movement and cause no trouble or worries of them falling off. Aside from that the figure can pull off some very dynamic poses including all of her famous poses as seen on the show. She has a wide range of movement with nothing really hindering her articulation. I advise that you be careful with the figure though because she can break rather easily if you do not handled her with care.<br />(4/5)<br /><br />~Stand~<br />Sailor Moon comes with a customized stand, it's a clear heart shaped base with her named printed in pink with a floral like design with a crescent moon symbol on the base. Though her name and symbols are printed on the stand upside down so that's sort of a bummer. The stands pole is very flexible and can also be posed to your liking to work with any kind of pose you chose to put your Sailor Moon figure in. The stand is very flimsy and really not all that special since this stand is the same exact stand that is also included with pretty cure figuarts figures. I wish they did something original for this release since this is Sailor Moon's 20th anniversary.<br />(2/5)<br />_____________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Over all this Sailor Moon figure is well worth the price in my opinion, she is entirely show accurate and comes with tons of accessories that most figuarts usually do not come with this amount. For the first and only Sailor Moon action figure this is really not a bad start. I do hope they release the rest of the characters and not just the inner core 5 Sailor Soldiers that they have plan to release through this year going into next year... I want to see a Tuxedo Mask, Sailor Neptune, Sailor Uranus, Sailor Pluto,  Sailor Saturn, & a Chibi Moon and maybe a special limited edition Super Sailor Moon or perhaps an Eternal Sailor Moon? I will defiantly be collecting all the Sailor Soilders & I think every Sailor Moon fan should at least have one of these figures for their collection. I give this figure 4 Stars, although it's visually stunning they could of improved some of the joints especially the hair, the figure feels very delicate and at times it feels as if you're going to break it if you are not careful. I wish they put some effort on a different stand & more color shading.
1782060790|5.0|Based on a terrifying premise, this story holds the reader's attention through many unexpected twists and turns.  The characters were distinct and very well drawn.

193413712X|4.0|This odd little book takes the reader deep into the life of the father of the main character.  The story is compelling, but the reader must be willing to follow the shifts in time and changes in point of view.
1476727651|5.0|First of all let me say that you do not need to have read The Shinning to enjoy Doctor Sleep--it stands alone. It is my favorite King novel in years. It is a wonderful story full of engaging characters that keeps you wanting to find out what happens next. With most of King's novel's I've found myself disappointed in the climax, not so with Doctor Sleep. I think it ranks right up there with The Shinning, It and The Stand as some of King's most enjoyable reads.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I found this book as hard to put down as I did the first in the series. Larsson ties this up with an excellent finish to one of the subplots and a satisfying ending. This is one of those series that you hate to finish as you just want more!
B00DSTBMMU|1.0|What a crap! For the 2nd time in a row after the just as lousy Miles from Memphis album. Terrible pop country music trash. This is definitively the end of my Sheryl fanship :-(

B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great series and happy to hear it's coming to the US in the 2014-2015 season. Can't wait for season 2 of the ITV production and season 1 of the US production.
B00C3V5TTQ|3.0|Really loved Modern  and was looking forward to OMD keeping up the pace with English Electric.  I ended up disappointed. There are a few good tracks here but it's not as good an effort as Modern.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is really well made, has levels suitable for everyone, and is very relaxing. The tutorial is thorough and I was never questioning what to do next. Great game that is surprisingly for free!
B009NQLT0M|3.0|Wanted a cheap, quiet fan to replace an old one that was getting noisier everyday.  This did the job perfectly and has remained quiet several months later.<br /><br />UPDATE - Changing review to three stars.  The fan ran nice an quiet for 10 months but is now quite noisy and needs replacing again.  I'll probably buy this same one again because it was so quiet initially.  I'll just have to plan on replacing it at least annually.
1609611543|5.0|Bought this book to get a new perspective on my &#34;beer belly&#34; since I drink very little beer and am active. I found reading it very informative and interesting. I have only been on the low/no wheat routine a couple weeks and feel I am getting the results promised in the book. Recommend it to anyone having major health issues or just dealing with a weight problem.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Just a few days after Joining Hands 2, we get another excellent Free App of the Day. Granny Smith is a lot of fun, and it's one of the more visually impressive games I've seen in the Amazon Appstore. Gameplay is simple. You control Granny, who loves her apples so much that she's strapped on roller skates to chase a young thief who's trying to steal them. But to get ahead of him and stay ahead, you'll have to time her moves just right. A button on the right side of the screen makes Granny jump. But it's not so much knowing when to jump that's an issue as knowing when to release the jump button so that Granny, who spins through the air as she moves forward, will land on her feet. If she doesn't, she'll slow way down, losing coins and allowing the thief to get ahead of her and take one of the three apples located somewhere in each level. (You don't have to get the apples or beat the thief to the finish line to clear the level; just getting to the end counts as a win.) At least in the early levels, timing a landing is the trickiest part of Granny Smith.<br /><br />But it gets easier with practice. Granny's other move, using a button on the left side of the screen to grab hold of wires with her cane and slide along them, is easier to manage. And the levels are short enough that even if it takes a couple replays, you won't feel like you're stuck in a rut. Besides, they're fun. There's a weird pleasure in watching Granny take flying leaps and burst through buildings like a superhero, never slowing down (if you've done it right) in her search for apples. As others have noted, after you finish a level you'll get an instant replay in old-fashioned sepia tone, and the game's graphics are nice enough that each replay feels like a short CGI cartoon. The game even saves the replay of your best run so you can watch it anytime. The basic background designs of levels in each world are pretty similar, but there are four very different worlds to look forward to.<br /><br />Doing well in a level earns coins, which can be used to buy power-ups (a helmet to protect Granny from bad falls during one level, several banana peels to slow down the thief while he's behind you, several baseballs to slow down the thief while he's ahead), skip levels, or unlock new playable characters you'd otherwise have to wait for. The game isn't super-generous with coins, so if there are several levels you really want to skip you may have to redo earlier levels a few times to get enough coins. But at least the game doesn't try to get more of your money by letting you buy coins: no in-app purchases here. Also no ads, and no suspicious permissions. Just a traditional but very polished game with a lot of charm. Offered free, Granny Smith is practically a must-download; even for $1.99, it comes strongly recommended unless you hate runner games.in a level earns coins, which can be used to buy power-ups (a helmet to protect Granny from bad falls during one level, several banana peels to slow down the thief while he's behind you, several baseballs to slow down the thief while he's ahead), skip levels, or unlock new playable characters you'd otherwise have to wait for.

B009IAGU3O|5.0|Meryl doing Julia...it was a perfect match.  Meryl Streep turns into Julia effortlessly.  She's a joy to watch.  Stanley Tucci as Julia's husband Paul was a stroke of genius.  Together they do great justice to the memory of Julia and Paul.<br />This is such a dear, sweet heart of a movie.  Fix a pot of coffee, sit back and enjoy.  The photography is lush.  The music score de-lovely.  The story is endearing.  Julia would be pleased.  It does make you long for Julia and her wall of pots and pans and sweet quirkiness.  I still miss her.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|LOVE the album & it grows on you the more you hear it. Tedeschi Trucks Band delivers, yet again : )
B005CGI4EG|3.0|The Show itself is in clear and amazing DVD/Audio Quality. My Two issues are (1. With being unable to acquire Frank Sinatra's Iconic song which complimented the show in its entirety it lost that magical extra that made the show a great hook. (2. The Packaging is bulky, and hideous from a collectors/fan POV. Its is by far the worst slapped together Complete Series box set  I have yet to come across. I Highly, Highly, recommend collecting the series by the seasons from a quality stand point its far better!!!!!
B000N2HCM4|5.0|As I read this book, I'm allowed a glimpse into a man's soul, who is so often misunderstood by many Americans.  He seems to have a gentle and loving spirit that is difficult to meld with hard nosed politics.  As an African American , he articulated some of my deepest feelings that I had not consciously allowed to surface. While reading this book, you are required often to stop and contemplate as to its deeper meaning.  This is one of the best books that I have ever read..  Mildred Strong
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Better than the 1st book!!! I am in absolute awe of the character development in this this book! I just could not get enough!

B008Y212PI|5.0|A great way to relax but still challenge the brain!  Using on a kindle fire HD 8.9 so the game is easy to use, i would not be able to use a smaller device without a stylus.

The story was pretty much what I had expected bit was very surprised (pleasantly) as to the temporary solution.<br /><br />It is definitely one that I could watch over and over and not grow tired of seeing.<br /><br />One small thing,though. I wish there was a little more gore. : )
B0088W4YTK|5.0|I never got to watch Stargate Atlantis when it first aired.  Now that I can watch the episodes in the order they were meant to be in, I've really enjoyed the series.  Classic characters portrayed by excellent actors carry this extension of the Stargate brand adventure.  Clever plot twists keep things very interesting.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great cast, great writing. Each episode of Downton is like a vacation to the world of 100 years ago (not that it was better, just so different). But people are the same. This season had plenty of twists and turns!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Im just getting to the part of the book where the cooking begins. Tims writing style is hilarious. There's so much to be learned in just the first few chapters. I see tweets all the time of people testing the recipes and loving them so I have no doubt I will too.

B008XG1X18|4.0|Its pretty cool. Sometimes its really slow and I've had to force close it more than once. Besides that its great!!
0061537969|5.0|This book was recommended to me a long time friend. Otherwise, neither the title nor a synopsis would have interested me. It is one of the best I have read in a very long time.<br /><br />The friend who loaned it to me is a racing official who can recite chapter and verse of just about every car made. I, on the other hand, view them as transportation. As for racing, well, I just don't know enough about it to get excited about watching cars go around the track at high speeds. I think I will enjoy it a lot more after reading this book.<br /><br />But make no mistake, you don't have to be a race fan to enjoy this book.  I must also mention, though I hesitate, that a dog is the protagonist and he writes the book. Get over it. It works. When I finished, I was convinced that only a dog could have told this story so well.<br /><br />Ever look into the eyes of a dog and see an old soul? Enzo, the dog, is an old soul.  Telling this story from a dog's viewpoint is humorous at times, but that is not what makes it a great book. The author brilliantly uses the dog to put a mirror onto human behavior.  We get to see our actions through an old soul's eyes and mind.<br /><br />I had never thought of it this way before, but a dog can say things (no, he is not a talking dog; we get to hear his thoughts) that seem profound but might sound sanctimonious or opinionated if spouted by a human.<br /><br />For example, Enzo posits, \\"I don't understand why people insist on pitting the concepts of evolution and creation against each other. Why can't they see that spiritualism and science are one?\\"  Some would want to argue with a human about that, but not a dog who doesn't really seem to have a \\"dog in the fight\\".  He's just an astute observer of the human (and the dog) condition.<br /><br />I have read about an animal's ability to sense illness in a human and Enzo can smell it.<br /><br />I also really related to this book because Enzo comes right out and faces head-on some of the principles of \\"the flow\\" that I tiptoed around in five novels. In many cases, I used sports as a means of relaying a life concept that I have come to believe. This book uses racing in the same way.<br /><br />Enzo has learned from Denny (owner or master just doesn't work when describing the relationship between Enzo and Denny) this principle as it applies to racing (and of course, to life).  \\"Such a simple concept, yet so true: that which we manifest is before us; we are the creators of our own destiny. Be it through intention or ignorance, our successes and our failures have been brought on by none other than ourselves.\\"<br /><br />I am reminded of the quote by someone that went something like this: \\"To find the source of almost of all of your problems, look in the mirror.\\"<br /><br />One somehow questions that theory when he hears it in a seminar or reads it in a book, but when Enzo says it, you somehow believe it. If a dog can figure this out, why can't we?<br /><br />Yet Enzo recognizes his own limitations as a dog in a human world. He has just the proper amount of humility. \\"By changing my mood, my energy, I allowed Eve (Denny's wife) to regard me differently. And while I cannot say that I am a master of my own destiny, I can say that I have experienced a glimpse of mastery, and I know what I have to work toward.\\"<br /><br />And make no mistake, author Garth Stein deftly manages to keep Enzo as a dog first, not some superhuman philosopher who puts himself above humans. That would have made it cartoonish. Enzo knows his limitations. \\"I knew what was wrong, but I had no way to tell her, so I pushed at her thigh with my muzzle.\\"<br /><br />This may be my favorite thing a dog can say that we can't say effectively. Enzo desires to come back as a person. \\"Here's why I will be a good person. Because I listen. I cannot speak, so I listen very well. I never interrupt, I never deflect the course of the conversation with a comment of my own. People, if you pay attention to them, change the direction of each other's conversations constantly. It's like having a passenger in your car who suddenly grabs the steering wheel and turns you down a side street.\\"<br /><br />Here's another: \\"So much of language is unspoken.\\" Think about how a dog who cannot speak has to rely on the rest of language, not only from himself, but from humans.<br /><br />I even agree with this dog's choice of great movies and actors. Shoot, I might start attending racing events now that I know how to race in the rain. \\"Racing is about discipline and intelligence, not about who has the heavier foot. The one who drives smart will always win in the end.\\"<br /><br />True for racing, baseball, golf, roping, or any sport, and of course, life.ange the direction of each other's conversations constantly.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Draws you in emotionally.  Not sure of inconsistancy in butler's banning maid for having been a prostitute but allowing a gay.  Seems like neither would fit in conservative era of the 20's - but show  brings out personalities and opinions of society.
B004EPYZSK|2.0|Typical 'high-concept' plot, where greedy, gold-hungry producers stumble on a genre-fusing idea they think will make millions - no matter how crappy it turns out.<br /><br />This could have been a brilliant, funny film, full of great social commentary. Instead, it was largely a wasted effort.<br /><br />I'd like to thank the members of the Academy for paying no attention whatever to this turkey.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Love this movie! It's a must for the Halloween season, or any season! One of the best musicals ever made!
0307454568|5.0|Enjoyed this book and the others, very much!  Absolutely cannot read one without reading the others to get the full story.  I like reading books that require that you continue in the series.
0425252868|5.0|This book on the European theater is one of the best books I've read on World War II, though mostly I read books on the Pacific theater.  It's the first one where I've learned what it was like from the German viewpoint.  Warning:  If you are one of those people that believes all Germans fighting in World War II were despicable Nazis, you might not like this book.  However, if you have an open mind at least, you might find your viewpoint changed quite a bit after reading this book.<br /><br />I particularly found the end of the book where it covered the ME 262 jet fighters to be especially enlightening.  I didn't realize those things were so dangerous to the pilots flying them.  The parts concerning north Africa were also very informative.  I think the book does over-emphasize that some allied pilots strafed parachuting German pilots, but I've read the same thing in other books about the Pacific war, where some US pilots strafed \\"enemy\\" pilots in chutes, only to find out later that they killed their own buddies.<br /><br />The book is largely about the German pilot Franz Stigler, though it does cover the American pilot Charlie Brown.  The actual amazing incident hinted at in the title and on the cover is written about in only one chapter.  The rest is lead-up and follow-up.  I think you'll find most of the German characters in this book likeable people, some of which risked their lives to stand up against orders they found wrong--in many cases simply refusing to obey them.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself with mixed emotions--sometimes pulling for the Germans in their battle efforts while at the same time feeling guilty that their targets were Americans or other Allies.<br /><br />If you want to expand your knowledge of World War II to include the German air soldier's viewpoint, you can't go wrong purchasing this book.
B000OVLINI|5.0|If Harry Potter and Gabriel Garcia Marquez's magical realism had a baby (with strains of an Agatha Christie mystery), The Shadow of the Wind would be that book. The book got off to a slow start for me. The repetition of the word &#34;palatial&#34; four times in the first 30-40 pages got on my nerves (Of course, this is translated from its original Spanish so I tried my best not to pass judgment on the translator's word choice).<br /><br />The story continued to unfold with pleasant plots and subplots and sub-sub plots. Each diverging narrative was a small present in the overarching story of a boy and his book. I was enchanted once I had hit fifty pages and found the book hard to put down.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|As many have stated already, this book was like a long drawn out trip to no place in particular. Mostly exposition it seemed.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This is possibly the coolest Lego set ever!  From a small collection of user-requested models.  Set includes pieces to build the DeLorean from any of the three movies.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Good fit, so far (1 week) reliable time telling. I wear it often and have yet to have he automatic feature fail to keep the watch running. The only mild complaint that I have is that the glow-in-the-dark paint on the watch hands is very faint at night.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I chose this movie because it is one of the best movies (IMO) in a long time. After I saw it in theatres, I couldn't wait to purchase it. Amazing movie from beginning to end, I can't wait for the second one.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app and use it for all my reminders! Iv'e used it for two years now and just downloaded it to my new phone.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|No gaming collection is complete without Sonic. The controls take a little adjusting to but once you do, it's a superior time-killer.
0425252868|5.0|HUMANITY TRANSCENDING PETTINESS<br />Story is well written, outlines bravery and trust that transcend petty nationalism and desire for decorative medals.  Story is related clearly without brutality that pervades so many war stories.  Concludes with a wonderfully redemptive finish and reconciliation.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|I loved the re-mastered version of this classic show. Five stars plus +++++.Great video and audio quality. Job well done.
B00B52FDXQ|4.0|I Like it, I have enjoyed viewing the episodes and will continue to watch the rest of the other dvds.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|such an amazing story couldn't put it down for a sec... I loved it so much and actually cried near the end for Gus
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games is an amazing series! I prefer hardcover books and these are fantastic!  I love that it comes inside a box and it would be great for readers of all ages!
B008Y212PI|3.0|I don't like ported games, they look awful among others. The game itself is fine but it doesn't do a good impression.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Fast paced cute-sy scatterbrain action, and a very catchy tune all rolled into one. easy to pick up, hard to put down; my favorite goto that doesnt require alot of time. I can just play for a few seconds if time permits.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|So far The best movie against war I've ever seen, and trust me that I've watched it more than once in differents stages in my life and show differents things to think about. The quality of this edition on DVD it's outstanding.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Super as usual. Could not put it down. A must if you like suspense and events that could actually happen in our government
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The best concert of rock I've ever seen in my life. Meets all my expectations referring to quality of musicians on the scenery.
B001AXME2S|5.0|One of the best reviews yet. You can hear it when you listen to it for yourself. I am Star Child.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've downloaded my share of calculator apps and this one is by far the best. My measure is how intuitive the app is and if the UI is seamless. this calc meets the mark!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Ground breaking series keeps kids fascinated and is hilarious for adults.  It's one of the best animated series made in recent years and nearly all of it is family friendly.  The whole family loves it.
0385340990|5.0|I had the kindle version and just wanted to own the book as well!  One of the best books I've read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I start playing and next thing I know, hours have gone by! It is really really cute! I love this game!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Truly a gifted a writer.  This is one I will actually read again - and with so many books and so little time, that is something to say.
B0047CPB42|2.0|I read this for my bookclub.....which is why I finished it. There were some good sections, but the book is a little dated.<br />The very end was a very weird ending, I almost enjoyed it but the last bit.....not my kind of book
B007G5H2HQ|4.0|Puss is funny, but Humpty Dumpty is creepy. The kids like the movie and there are enough twists and turns in the plot that it is entertaining for adults as well.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I loved it. The scenes with the wall were crazy. Shows that the world is connected and everyone can be effected.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I enjoys this book  it was a fun read.  It was interesting from start to end.  If you haven't read this book you should
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Lots of action. I really hope this isn't the last IM movie, that would be disappointing. I will look to seeing IM in the Avengers. Well worth the rental price. Very entertaining!
B006TF6WAM|4.0|It was a journey with a vulnerable but truly admirable lead character that I enjoyed from start to finish.  Just goes to show the strength and vulnerability of the elderly.
B002VWNIDG|3.0|I wanted to watch this movie but my husband told me to read the book first. The book is great. I loved it. I was excited to watch the movie but had a very big disappointment...it wasn't anything like what I thought it would be like. It didn't exactly follow the book--but then again what movie does? I mean this REALLY didn't follow the book. Yeah it had a few pieces out of the book and that was it. It covered only those pieces. If it would have had more of the book in it I would have enjoyed it a lot better. It was an OK movie so I gave it 3 stars.
B00755MHXG|5.0|This was one of the most beautifully engaging stories I have ever read.  The lead character is inspirational and braver than most adults.  I wept at the end of the novel - tears of joy, not pity!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Definitely a must watch / re-watch for die hard trekies! I love this show! Watch it again you will not be disappointed.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|An easy read with complex characters - It reminded me of the characters in the Big Bang Theory.  Funny and highly recommended
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's  great book better than the first. Fast read. I love the series. I am reading the final book now.
B004S5FW1U|4.0|A lighthearted story of likeable, vulnerable characters and their struggle with mental illness. I haven't seen the movie but thoroughly enjoyed the book...
0895292211|5.0|Enzymes are not just helpful, they are necessary for life. When you run out of Enzymes, you die. If you want to understand why your body needs enzymes to function, this book explains it in detail. This book is not a pep talk, it's a scientific study.
B0013NAP2G|5.0|Excellent Music Video and Live Performances by Mariah! Some nice hits from her new CD &#34;The Emancipation of MIMI which is an outstanding CD. I highly recommend this DVD!
B00E0SX118|5.0|From the opening scene, this sweet movie draws you and in and makes you root for this precious family.  It is beautifully done, and I highly recommend this for all ages!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I didn't that I recall watch this movie, maybe I will take the time to watch someday but right now I jave not
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|TTB continues to improve, vocals are smoother on the offering and Derek is just getting better and better. Good music choices too. Definitely a keeper, highly recommended.
B006S08RLU|5.0|A great unexpected movie that definitely will give you some warm feelings toward the end. It's definitely a must see!
B0086449YA|3.0|I put on the disc and had the feeling that I already have this disc but not the case. It has good tunes but it seems that Mark is blurring them together, it is not the innovative guitarist we first heard.
B00D2CYU2W|1.0|WOW, maybe a little toooo graphic and the ???language, was that real or just an effort to degrade Lee?<br />I would have enjoyed more music and less unnecessary trash. This story could have been told beautifuly not trashy.<br />It was an obvious attempt at degrading Lee, by an angry sick looser.
B00DC3DGSK|3.0|Buddy is capitalizing on his recent presidential concert, not as good as I expected! Good listen but as a double disc offering.. they probably could have pared it down to one disc and not lost anything.
0385523394|4.0|I found this book really interesting. I had watched the TV series and was mesmerized. ( I actually thought the TV series was better than the book which is highly unusual.) The book , which is written by the main character, Piper, is interesting because it is a first person account of what she genuinely experienced in prison. Also, the fact that she continues to be active in the prison movement is much to her credit.  The book is definitely worth the read, but no masterpiece here.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is well constructed, written beautifully, a page turner. I could not put it down. I was hooked from the first page!
B001R6AW18|5.0|I will always love the old movies, because what they are making today isn't so good. I really don't go to the movies very much. I am a home body person.
B00122MBY8|5.0|I recently download this.  I cannot stop listening to it.  I wish I had discovered this years ago.  This is definitely Van Morrison at his finest.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Love is a beautiful thing. When its true love it is more beautiful than anything in the wold. People today don't stay together long enough. They don't try to make it work. They let there different ways get in the way. And it take two to make it work.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Omg I was mad when the first one was like 2.99 or something now the second one is free I'm so happy great for all ages.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|It  is nice to finally get some of the old movies that you enjoy and can now watch them whenever I like.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|This sleeve is the perfect size for Kindle with great protection. Convenient handle on outside. Would definately recommend this product.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series and looking forward to watching all the episodes. Can't wait for the new season to start in the fall.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Another nice game advertised as FREE but inevitably you'll need to do in-app purchases to continue playing.  Very similar to other first-person run and dodge games...  nice graphics, and great sense of humor.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love the show. I just finished season four and I like where it is heading. Wish she was not an atheist.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Loved this book. We'll written  and so many interesting personal information about our most respected inventors. You will not be able to stop reading this amassing true story.
1885167776|5.0|I'm not a big fan of books that are supposed to motivate, but they're backed with nothing but one person's opinion. This book is backed with copious research on how to make the right decisions that will propel your life in positive directions. You'll learn it's not THE ONE thing, it's figuring out which one thing in each dominion of your life will change everything else in that dominion. Can one simple (deceptively simple....) question change your life? YES!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very horse lover friendly! Its almost as if I have a real horse!! Also the graphics are pretty awesome!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|A mystery that leads to several possible conclusions and leaves the writer guessing while the detectives are working. This book sets the framework for the Nikki Heat series. I recommend this book especially to persons familiar with the Castle TV series.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Awesome hbo show with great directing and acting and very intense battle scenes while still being true to the story. Great introductory interviews too.
1426209584|5.0|Well written and lavishly illustrated book about a truly fascinating group of birds. I shopped and found it at a great price.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|This one was just ok.  Didn't seem to have to many levels and I got through them pretty quick.  Its the kind of thing I like to figure out but it needs more levels.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great show and Season 3 gives more substance to the series. I recommend watching this show.
B005V5WBFG|3.0|Haven't really had time to check it out completely.  Seems to slow my tablet down some but it maybe a easy fix
B00EJU8ZIG|4.0|Lorde is talented, and i like her new album a lot, but I'm disappointed that she did not include bravado, or love club from her EP on this album.<br />In my opinion those are two of her best songs, and are also two of her most \\"single friendly\\" catchy songs.<br /><br />When a young artist like Lorde gets recognized for her music and real talent, and not doesn't need to prance around half naked and employ 20 useless backup dancers, it is a beautiful thing.<br /><br />She certainly deserves the attention she is getting.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Well Gillian Flynn has done it again.  She produced another book that is filled with surprises and makes the reader want to drop everything and sit down and read. I love her style of writing and can't wait to read a third book by her.
B00DUE8IXY|5.0|There is not much to say other than this album is awesome.  One always has to wonder what someone's original material will sound like when their first album was all covers.  Clearly Birdy knows how to write! There is a great mix of song styles that really shows off Birdy's talent.  There is not a single song on this album that i dont like.<br /><br />I can say with confidence that if you liked her first album you will absolutely not be disappointed with Fire Within.<br /><br />Note: i do not own the deluxe edition, but there was no place to review the \\"standard edition\\"
B00063F8B2|5.0|Our family loves the Polar Express movie so much. The soundtrack is great! I Wish I had purchased it sooner. My youngest son (5) has songs from this CD on his iPod currently - and it's still summer!
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Good science fiction show with a witty script.  This is what many shows have tried to do but Torchwood, Buffy and Firefly set the mark that other show can only hope to match.
B005I6EU48|5.0|Really cool look to the kindle. It looks like it's a book! I have gotten a few compliments and asked where I got it.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Many individuals who are on the autism spectrum or who have loved ones think this movie is stigmatizing individuals on the spectrum. It is not and let me explain why:<br /><br />First of all, savant type ASD individuals are very very rare, but I have met a child who memorizes all license plates on his street during one walk on that street. So, it is true, there are people like Raymond. 1 in a billion but there are.<br /><br />Secondly, people miss an important point because the movie is Charlie's story, not Raymond's. Charlie changes visibly in this movie, but Raymond does, too. After years of seclusion in an institution, Raymond relates to his brother and can show that he cares about him (end of the movie and bath-tub scene among others). Charlie actually is the only person who can see that Raymond is more than what he seems socially, because he accepts him with his differences. That is why Raymond can relate to him.<br /><br />So, this is a love story in the making and a heroic one for that matter. It is a love story where two brothers win over obstacles (Raymond's autistic traits).
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved Moyes' style of writing.  The tale unfolded slowly and purposefully - and became complicated, as complicated as life can be sometimes.  A wonderfully written account of tragedy and relationships.
B008Y212PI|3.0|its fun to play but needs more levels. I finished the whole thing in like three days. don't waste two dollars if you're. not sure you want it.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|Needed a quick source of information while on the go; I don't always have to wait until I get home to the encyclopedias.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This man is one of the very best songwriters ever born! His voice is very soothing also. I could have done without the remixes at the end, but overall I am very pleased with this music.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This show is complicated - I like that I cannot guess the plot twists. And the dilemmas are realistic for the most part...
B000HSKUBE|4.0|After you watch the Brits series you'll know why it just had to be imported. I really enjoyed the series
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Love the sires!  Didn't have the time to watch it before but with my Prime Membership have been able to go through the whole sires!!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Easy reading and very instructive! It is good to understand that even very brigth and genius have to work very hard, and even so, sucess does come easy!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|It is so fun I love it and trying to make it .I love all the fun characters fun for kids
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is the third in a series of Cut The Rope games from ZeptoLab.  And it is in keeping with the two previous games.  The concept is the same -- get the candy to OmNom by &#34;cutting the rope&#34; (though there are a lot more things to do than just cutting a rope, as new challenges and objects are introduced as the levels increase).<br /><br />The music is as much fun as the game; and watching OmNom's facial features as I either succeed or fail on a given level is one of my favorite parts of the game.  Quite clever and humorous, yet should challenge even the most game-hardy.
B003M6EAXM|4.0|I really like the characters and the storylines in this series, however at times it just drags a bit.....Can't wait for the new 24 they are planning on. I think they are going to do it different enough to take care of the drag.....
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This is a faithful and realistic implementation of a familiar board game.  I enjoy board games that I can play against the computer.  (I'm not into online games, or playing with others who I don't even know.  And I usually only have a very limited amount of time to play a game, so it has to be on my time, and whenever I like.)  This version of Backgammon plays a good game -- but not the kind where you will be beaten every time you play.  (I hate computer chess games, for example.)  Of course, it's still a game of change; your success depends, to a great extent, on the &#34;roll of the dice&#34; -- literally. But in this case, that roll seems pretty fair.  And with some careful playing, I tend to win more games than I lose -- which is fine with me.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Clever drama that keeps your interest from episode to episode.<br />Check out the first episode and I'm sure you'll be watching the others.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I just finished reviewing another HO game, which I scored fairly medium -- mostly because it was a simple (and boring) game.  Pirate Adventures is exactly the opposite -- it's &#34;my kind of HO&#34; game.  The hidden objects occur in &#34;normal&#34; scenes, scattered among many, many other &#34;normal&#34; objects.  But in addition, the levels of the game progress through a complete story, which develops as the player moves through the game.<br /><br />The scenes are marvelously crafted, with the utmost detail.  (I played this on a 10&#34; tablet; and I would think it would be VERY difficult on a 4&#34; phone screen, as many of the objects are quite small.)  Thankfully, the game allows the player to &#34;zoom in&#34; on each scene -- though the zoom level is less than 2:1.  There are hints within the game, and they're implemented very well (and fairly).  The player should never get completely &#34;stuck&#34; -- which is something I like.  (I don't play games to be &#34;challenged to the point of being stuck&#34;; I play them for relaxation and enjoyment.)<br /><br />This game was implemented very well -- as are quite a few other HO games by Nevosoft (e.g., Mysteryville).  Kudos to the developers for providing a game that is fun to play, that is often challenging but without being intimidating, that has the highest quality graphics, and plenty of user help to get them through.
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|Iron Man 3<br /><br />Action! Action! Action! Action!<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is great as Iron Man...a role that fits perfect.<br /><br />Loved it.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|One of the things I look for is &#34;unique&#34; games -- games that provide something that isn't already available in dozens of other games.  (Can you say &#34;match-3&#34; or &#34;hidden object&#34;???)  Totemo begins as a very simple concept, but quickly graduates into some extremely challenging levels, all based on math and logic.  There is some &#34;background story&#34; -- though it does not affect the gameplay at all, and frankly is pretty mundane for the most part.  But anyone who likes a logic challenge should enjoy this game.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I got this game when it went on sale and it is the greatest app i have. You can save gotham or just run around the city. Graphics are great and the story fits with the movie. One of te few games that is worth twenty dollars but is an app. You will love it if you like batman or not.
B004ZH66XO|3.0|In this game, you guide a fish through waters filled with other fish -- both &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34;.  You want to &#34;consume&#34; the smaller fish (to increase your own size) while avoiding *being* consumed by the larger fish.<br /><br />I've played games like this before, and enjoyed them.  So I figured I would enjoy Grow, as well.  And it is a fun -- and simple -- game.  However, it quickly becomes too frenetic for me.  My ideal game is one that I can use for relaxation.  I am not a &#34;fast-finger&#34; gamer; I'm not usually looking for something that *adds* to my daily stress, but rather provides some quiet relaxation.<br /><br />I would compare Grow with Osmos in concept.  However, I much prefer Osmos for its calm, quiet gameplay, accompanied by incredibly beautiful and ethereal music.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Still readng it and it is keeping me up too late as it is hard to put down. Bounces from one era to the next so be prepared for your mind to bounce around with it.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|What can I say about Pudding Monsters?  Created by the same folks who brought you Cut The Rope (and its sequels), Pudding Monsters is another game with hilarious animated characters who sway and dance to the background music, and who contribute to the challenge of the logic puzzle at each level.  The game begins simply, and is easy to pick up. All of the Pudding Monsters at the start of each level must be &#34;brought together&#34; (into one big pudding) to complete the level.  On each level an added challenge is to bring them together on top of one or more stars on the grid -- almost like gathering the stars in the Cut The Rope games.<br /><br />As the levels progress, new Pudding Monsters are introduced, each with new features and characteristics.  The levels get increasingly challenging; but the challenge is rarely a stressful one, as the humor in each scene makes it more light-hearted and whimsical.  This is another huge winner from ZeptoLab.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Piper was able to detail how truly slow the Federal government moves in adjudicating these cases. I believe she portrayed an accurate portayal of life in a Fedaral penal System but on the other hand, may have been afforded some benefits that women of color and of lower socio-economic status (which are the majority) seldom see.
B00640UICA|5.0|Joining Hands is another new game in a genre similar to Cut The Rope, Pudding Monsters, and other fun level games.  The game begins fairly easily, asking the user to move cute little characters around a board in such a say that they all can &#34;hold hands&#34;. The thing is, some have one hand, some have two, and others have three, four, even five!  And to pass the level, all hands from everyone must be holding someone else's hand.<br /><br />Sound simple?  Then add a few other things into the mix:  Characters who are less flexible in how you can configure them;  characters who NEVER want to hold hands (and are unhappy if they're even near anyone else); reshape the board to make it more difficult, and on and on.  The game gets continually more difficult, and should present a challenge even to the most logical puzzle aficianado.<br /><br />To add to the game's &#34;fun&#34;, the background music is very up-beat; and the characters themselves are animated -- becoming &#34;happy&#34; when they are holding hands, and &#34;sad&#34; when they are not; and even doing a bit of a &#34;dance&#34; when they all are holding hands and the level is solved.  It's hard NOT to like this game -- it's a very cheery pastime.
B001THZAAI|5.0|I enjoy being able to have English subtitles or the option of French subtitles.  It was much easier to &#34;get&#34; some of the humor when I could see the French.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Snark Busters took me by surprise -- mostly because of its whimsical nature and storyline that captured me.  I often found myself smiling broadly at something in the game, and that adds to my enjoyment of any game.  I will point out that this is not exactly &#34;my type&#34; of HO game.  I like HO games where the scenes are highly detailed, and filled with many, many &#34;normal&#34; objects, and among them are the &#34;hidden&#34; objects -- but hidden only by the complexity of the scene.<br /><br />In Snark Busters, you are still looking for hidden obejcts; but none of the objects are actually in the picture.  Instead. what is hidden in the picture are *pieces* of the objects -- and you have to find ALL OF THE PIECES before you have &#34;found&#34; (or can &#34;use&#34;) that object.  For example, a &#34;hidden&#34; lamp may consist of a piece of the base hidden in one location, a piece of the upright somewhere else, a piece of the shade somewhere else, another piece of the shade yet somewhere else, etc.  And the &#34;pieces&#34; don't even look anything like the object itself.  They are usually triangles or curves or other geometric shapes, that -- when they have ALL been found -- *finally* come together to form the lamp, or other object.<br /><br />It's just as challenging an HO game; but not my favorite style.  However, I still enjoyed the game enough to move on to Snark Busters 2.  (Big mistake, BTW.  Read my review on that one.  What a contrast!)
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Very moving, and based on an actual story.  Though the base for the events was tragic, there was a wonderful amount of humor and hopefulness.  Again, the English subtitles are helpful; but the French subtitles are even more so.
B00F91H666|5.0|This is one of the better zombie movies I have seen in awhile. Brad Pitt did an awesome job. The movie kept my attention from beginning to end.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Full of innocence! This story shows you a world that could be considered ideal through the eyes of a child! It makes you grateful to have choices but also makes you yearn for a world lacking pain, hunger, and suffering! Could not put it down.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I had been searching for a decent pinball app for awhile but only to  disappointment in the end. And here we have not just a great pinball app but it's a STAR WARS PINBALL APP!!! .... AND ITS SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY!!!  This one delivered.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Beautiful outtakes from the original Self Portrait sessions. Eric Andersen's Thirsty Boots is a beautiful surprise. Pick the deluxe edition up - you won't regret it.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend, maybe 2 years ago! They're still working until this day! Had to tape it together though. It's coming apart! but anyway, If I were to buy these types of headsets again, I would! They're great!
B008WOULPK|4.0|I always enjoy reading a book about someone's fabulous life through their eyes. And this is exactly that kind of book. Grace has experienced both extraordinary events and hardships in her life; but she didn't shy away too much from the truth. As a lover of fashion I loved learning the history behind so many fashion icons we still admire today. Reading this book is like having the privilege of walking through Vogue and getting to go through closets and being allowed the inside scoop. I
B00FG5E03W|5.0|When I first watched this, I had no clue what was happening until the last ten minutes of the film.<br /><br />But, I'll be damned if it wasn't a fantastic tale up until that point, only made better with a strong and fantastic finish.<br /><br />There will be enough pseudo-reviews and spoiler-y feedback given for this film, so let me just say this: I watched this film for the movie's sake (love Rhys Ifans).  I like plots with diverging plot lines.  I dig a little alt-fiction and sci-fi.<br /><br />This delivered in every single way - in spades.  Of the same cerebral impact as 'Moon', and Leto handles multiple characters with as much efficiency as Sam Rockwell in that piece.<br /><br />This is absolutely worth the time!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Yahoo Mail is very easy to navigate thru.  In all the time I have had it I have never had a problem.

B0061S073A|5.0|This is great to block ads that would allow unsupervised acess to the Internet. Had my son accessing amazon and the Internet with his nabi through ads. This product stop that it works great!

B003M6OW4Y|5.0|I found it quite interesting that each &#34;Doll&#34; could effectivly display the different characters that were downloaded into them.  I enjoyed the show and wonder what it might look like in a re-boot today.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This song gets me pumped when I run, i just love it!  It is fast and fun and just a great song.
0399159347|5.0|This book is excellent if you want a book that you can not put down and that is light but emotionally moving nonetheless.  It is about how we often have really crazy thinking! it is like  being inside the minds of three women whose lives interweave, the author does a fabulous job of making you care what is going on with these women even though are quite neurotic, they are also women I can relate to. Liane Moriarty is a great writer! I would read another of her books and hope to soon.
B00003W8NM|2.0|item was fine, but probably shouldn't have been listed as new.  Not a huge deal, but there was no booklet in the sleeve next to the discs.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Love having this. It was bigger than I thought it would be, but it fits in my camping gear well.
B0085W09ME|5.0|Within seconds I was able to find the least expensive flight between Florida and Massachusetts, then Florida to Cancun, etc. This application went straight to the heart of the matter, sparing me all those horrible websites that make it nearly impossible to find what I  need. Good Show!
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book is compelling and written in a format where you truly become part of the story. The imagery is vivid and draws you in as you go through the story. This book will be enjoyed by all readers, even if the reader is not a science fiction fan.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|My first reaction is &#34;what do they want me to do?&#34;. This I figured out on the first floor, but it became so progressively difficult I de-installed the program after the 4th floor
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I purchased this game and I don't think that it's worth it because it will only let me play to level 10.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Good acting, decent story, lots of action, not too corny like other zombie movies.. Doesn't get too in depth on zombie details.
B008S4FZHI|4.0|Not the best scarpetta I have read but once I got into it  I found myself wanting to find out what  happened next.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I've ever read I really recommend it for Suzanne Collins fans. If you liked the other 2 get this one.
B000002UY5|5.0|Blind Melon was a band that was way ahead of their time and this first album was proof of that! Anyone who is sick of the new bands coming out today, this is a must have for those who want to listen to something good as well as a familiar point in time. They were robbed of so much potential when Shannon Hoon had overdosed in 1995 but their music was so unique that their fans will always be fans and their music will always be remembered!
B0085A9HXS|5.0|The raid redemption is what action movies should be. A simple story that pushes the story forward. Then the most important part, the action, and this movies has a lot of that. the first minute or 2 sets up the main character then the action starts and it does not let up until the end. The fighting was just fast enough to see every hit and be in awe. If your thinking about watching this, JUST WATCH IT. And I have to add that Mad Dog is the perfect bad guy for this movie.
B000M2E42G|3.0|I'm usually not a big fan of Greatest Hits albums, but this one is pretty decent. It's Bruce Springsteen, not much else really needs to be said!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|It was okay it went by kinda slowly but for the most part it was a really good book ok
B00004SE9B|5.0|This album was such a great album and unappreciated (due to the radio stations playing out the song &#34;What's Up? (What's Going On?)&#34; There are much better songs than that songin my opinion and if there was only one reason to buy this album today would be to hear the song &#34;Drifting&#34;... such a beautiful song!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this set of puzzles. They are very much like boxed puzzles. I would recommend this to my friends.
B001EIOOV8|4.0|I mainly bought this movie for my Dad as a gift because although he had seen and adored the movie Goodfellas (which had a lot of the same cast members as this movie), he had never seen it, so I thought it would be good for him to add it to his library. It's a good movie but it must've been tough for Martin Scorsese to try to direct a better movie than Goodfellas. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Can you you guys please help people who uses the kindle :( because I still can't log in an it's been going for quite some time an you guys arnt doing anything about it
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Probably the last Slipknot recording we will ever see. After Paul died, the band pretty much did too. Such a shame! Album itself has some good music available! A must for the avid Slipknot fan!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I loved playing this game but now it keeps telling me there is a necessary download that needs to be done and as soon as I click on it to download it goes straight to the home page for the game in the app store. And there the only option I have is to open the game which brings me right back to the download screen in the game. Never ending circle of frustration! I have submitted a note to the makers so I hope they can fix it for me because I really don't want to get rid of this game.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|I am not going to lie... at first, I wasn't a very big fan of Mumford & Sons. I bought the first album and thought it was decent but nothing I would want to spend money to witness in person. Then one night as I was flipping through movie channels, The Road to Red Rocks film was scheduled to play at 2 a.m. and I couldn't stay up to watch it. So, I set my DVR to record it so I could watch it later. After watching them perform live, I gained a whole new respect for them. After watching the DVR movie channel version about 10 or more times, I realized that I had to purchase this film for myself! But more than anything, I wanted to be able to listen to it in my car.<br /><br />So when I went to amazon to see how much a DVD and/or an audio CD of that same show was going to cost, I found this deluxe edition of their newest album that also included a version of the film on DVD as well as an audio recording.. all for a few dollars more than just the DVD alone! I bought three of them as they make great gifts! Also, not only does the film look & sound better than the DVR recording I had originally watched, it also had more songs than the movie channel version had shown!<br /><br />There's something great about watching this band live as opposed to listening to an album. To me, it is what makes them go from a decent band to a great band! The album is great, the bonus tracks are good and the film is a MUST SEE for all Mumford & Sons fans!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Such a story of Faith, Hope Love and acceptance of life may have in sore for us. Is reading this book 4 time too much?
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I love this cd. Darius Rucker is the best. His music is very easy to listen to. Great buy for everyone.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I am NOT a fan of zombie movies, however the story line, cast, and special effects made this a really good movie. I was very surprised, and will definitely watch it again.
B00846REIS|1.0|Loved the book.  Great story and really enjoyed reading this book.  Immediately went and purchased part two of the TRILOGY and before I even started reading I find out there will be FIVE books instead of three.  Trilogy is what I was made to understand before I purchased the first book.  Now I understand the price increase...it's ALL ABOUT THE MONEY now.  Right, Ms. DAY?  Thanks for making me feel cheated and lied too!!  I doubt my kindle ever sees another one of your books.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|Pretty true to the book, this movie is a wonderful family movie about loss and redemption, about dreams and longing. While it does have a neat, happy ending, there's plenty of conflict on the way there to make it believable. The bad guys aren't so bad that you hate them and the good guys (the children) are good and powerful, just as every child wants to be. For every child who has ever felt alone, powerless, friendless, this movie will simply feel good.
0811879542|5.0|My 3-year-old granddaughter and her cousin (little boy) loved, loved, loved this unique INTERACTIVE BOOK. Adorable squeals of laughter with requests to read it again and again and again ... Cutest book ever--and no electronics!!!
B005F9TQ4C|3.0|Bob isn't afraid to try something new (for him). Whether recording a country album or rearranging hits, he keeps moving. If Dylan had simply regurgitated Blonde On Blonde for the rest of his career, he would had faded long ago. That he can reinvent himself, give an average effort, and later produce a masterpiece, is part of his mythos and genius.<br /><br />On Street Legal he tries a big band sound, with horns and a chorus of female background singers. On the surface, it sounds good. The musicianship is high and the arrangements are nice to listen to (in the remixed version). But the songs are average, for Dylan. Lyrically there are fine moments, but they are few. The background singers are overused. It's listenable, yet flawed.<br /><br />There are nice moments early on. Changing Of The Guard works within this kind of arrangement. New Pony is a bluesy song of the kind that Bob does well. After that it all kinds of runs together with a never-ending girl chorus and horn chart. Senor cuts through, and even We Better Talk This Over grabs your attention towards the end. It's clear what Bob is reaching for here, he just doesn't reach it.<br /><br />Not one I will return to often, and not worthy of five or even four stars. But it's not a total failure or lemon.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Like always Nathan Fillion truly owns the his role.  In particularly, as the captain badass.  I am only dissappointed that there is only one season.  Can't wait to watch Serenity.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read a book that I didn't want to put down for a long time. Wanted to finish but hated for it to end. He is such a good storyteller.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|This was a fantastic mecha vs monster movie. You don't go into this movie taking everything seriously. You go in for one hell of a fun ride. Grab some popcorn and just enjoy. The bigger the screen the better. Sure some of the story is cheesy, but the action and extremely well done effects are worth it. This movie is what Transformers failed to be. It conveys the heft of these mechs, their size. You sense the enormity of these machines and creatures all the way to the detail of the rain on their skin or the convulsing muscles and metal. For fans of classic Japanese mecha you'll love the throwback hints to classic Toho creatures and shows like Ultraman or Mazinger. Why the comparison to Shawshank Redemption? Well this movie has been garnering very high critic ratings and yet it was almost invisible to American audiences. Not sure if that was due to the marketing or that most people thought it would be a terrible kiddy movie. Either way, I think it will be a late bloomer on video as people discover what they missed in the theater. By the way, its too bad if you missed it in the theater because this movie has some of the best 3D I have ever seen in a movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book. It was a real page turner and I didn't want it to end. Would read this author again.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Very addictive read, love the characters, loved that this is believable, solo is a character that I could feel sorry for and want something good to come from his silo
B001EPIIMC|5.0|I was looking a long time for a good quality version of this record.<br />Found it, bought it<br /><br />Perfect album
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Great high action. I read the book, so I know it was impossible to replicate. There were a few elements NOT in the book. Overall it was a a very fun and lightly creepy action flick. I saw it twice in the theater and once at home with the wifey. She did not think it was scary. Hope this helps!
B003INBOE2|3.0|the movie is great and exciting but the blu ray doesn't play sometimes. it takes forever to load and sometimes it doesn't
B005JR47R6|4.0|I THINK HE IS BRILLIANT, WILE HE CURES THE PATIENT HE ALSO FINDS OUT MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT SURRAUNDS HIM.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do an excellent job of portraying Johnny and June Carter Cash. Their acting makes the characters come to life. For someone who was only vaguely familiar with the life of Johnny Cash, though I had heard many of his songs, \\"Walk the Line\\" gave me an insight into the life of this complex man. From his youth on through his adult life, one almost destroyed by addiction, we find a person who, like many of us, has to fight his demons, but must do so while in the public spotlight. And, like the rest of us, he fails time and again. However, thanks to his second wife, June Carter, who never stops believing in him, and his own willingness to persevere, he triumphs in the end.<br /><br />\\"Walk the Line\\" does not idolize Johnny Cash but rather casts him in an honest light, one that clearly shows both the good attributes and the character flaws of this man.<br /><br />If I were to offer any criticism it is that occasionally (but only occasionally) the movie drags. Some of the more repetitive scenes could have been shortened or excised entirely without doing damage to the movie as a whole. However, this does not detract from the value of the movie as well as the redemptive message it sends, and therefore the movie is clearly worth five stars.
B002DR3WG2|5.0|I think is such a well-written book. The characters are so perfect and so relatable and the theme of pride and prejudice gives such a strong message. I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone below around 15 because it's a bit more sophisticated, but it really is a great book and everyone should experience it at some point in their lifetime.
B000VIPJKM|4.0|\\"Legally Blonde\\" is about Elle (Reese Witherspoon), a sorority girl who, during her senior year in college, is dumped by her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, because, according to him, she is not smart enough to be the wife of a future lawyer/senator. Elle sets out to prove him wrong. Warner has already been accepted at Harvard Law School, so Elle applies, sends a most unusual application, and is accepted. Somehow, despite some missteps along the way, Elle manages to succeed at Harvard, graduating at the top of her class, and gets placed with a top-rate firm, while Warner languishes near the bottom of his class.<br /><br />And that's the plot. Which means that the plot is pretty straightforward, easy to follow, and lacks subtlety. One might add that it's a bit trite. Moreover, the improbability of Elle getting accepted at Harvard Law, given her credentials (or lack thereof), is overwhelming, as is the improbability of her rising to the top of her class. So, one has to do a little suspending of disbelief to accept the story line. But, after all, this is a comedy, which, I suppose, makes this okay.<br /><br />However, the movie is redeemed by Reese Witherspoon. \\"Legally blonde\\" is one of her earlier efforts, but her talent, which has become even more evident in subsequent movies, is already on display, and, really, is enough to carry the entire movie and make it a movie that is worth watching once.  The truth is that despite its lack of depth, one can't help but root for Elle to turn the tables on Warner Huntington III, which she does from start to finish.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Overall it is a good keyboard and once you get used to it saves time. I have no complaints so far and recommend it to others.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I really enjoyed the 3D effects in the movie. I was not as fond of the actors, but that is probably because I like the original Star Trek cast.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I love this game but the last few days it won't let me on to play. I'm really frustrated by this! The game is fun and has beautiful graphics but I guess there is something wrong with the update.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Not the usual fare, but a great read nonetheless. Brandon is at his best and the dialogue is sublime. Highly recommended!

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It's been a long haul to get to the end of this epic. I've thoroughly enjoyed this telling of good versus evil - even though to me it was overly wordy.<br />For those who love reading and fantasy, this is a tale for you
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Love this ear piece!  Works great .... no problems .... wouldn't buy anything else ... this headset is everything the manufacture says it is

1401938906|3.0|I tried 48 hour experiments: They have not to date worked for me.<br />Ideas great, did not like some of the words made lightly.<br />I did buy a book to give to my Brother on his 70th birthday. 9/26. He has not read it as yet:(
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Great story with sympathetic characters that you care about. They lead normal modern complicated lives looking for happiness without knowing it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Getting aggravated with these issues. It doesn't refresh like it should. Notifications are always late. I had one notification that didn't show up for almost an hour. And I don't see all the posts from everyone that I should see.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3 continues the excellent story line the of preceding seasons. This series is very well written and the actors are wonderful together! I started watching the series due to a friends recommendation and once into it just had to continue to follow all the twists and turns. I became very involved with the characters which is the sign of a good show for me.  I highly recommend all seasons of this series!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Different,addictive,some levels in the game (for me) are very difficult. Because the items listed to be found are very well hidden. Have to be fast or time will run out.
B008RKGFTK|5.0|Having seen this movie in the theater in the late 70's it was a nostalgia trip. Richard Gere looks his hottest in this film. I absolutely love the Giorgio Moroder soundtrack. Giorgio done a number of soundtracks during that period that I liked.  It added a lot to the film. I highly recommend this film to anyone that has never seen it or anyone that remembers it....Well worth another look...
B0035JNTA6|5.0|Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell are hilarious in this movie about male models. It's a must see for any fan.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is fun. I have had a lot of fun collecting pictures. If you like number games give this game a try.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|Before we attend to details about the movie itself, I want to draw your attention to an item I spotted in the lab scene (6:17). When Tony asks for the Christmas music to begin, there's a quick shot of the record player. Nearby, there's a red album cover on the table.<br /><br />It's A Charlie Brown Christmas, the read-along storybook and record album with dialogue from the sound track. This record album was released in the late '70s on the \\"Charlie Brown Records\\" label, a division of Disneyland/Vista Records. You won't see this factoid anywhere else, nor should you. Apparently talented visionary genius types like Tony Stark like Peanuts -- and cool cartoon records.<br /><br />(AS IN MOST REVIEWS, THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS ABOUT WHAT SPOILED THE MOVIE)<br /><br />Anyway, I wish the entire film was as satisfactory. Iron Man 3 was certainly entertaining in the current superspetacular movie-as-theme-park-ride way, but there are some serious story flaws that I suspect sprang from whoever forced the filmmakers to add the \\"twist\\" of the Mandarin being an actor.<br /><br />I do not object to the idea as a comic book fan as so many have, but because you can tell that the rest of the film seems to have been reconfigured to make this micro-managed plot splotch work.<br /><br />It may be a guess, but if the film were not reconfigured, that would make the two years of work by the entire cast and crew seem less than what they are clearly capable of. The film works so well up until the scene in which the fake Mandarin is revealed, I cannot believe that that such an experienced, accomplished team did this by design. Something's fishy, no matter how much the director and screenwriter valiantly try to make excuses for the situation on the otherwise fascinating audio commentary (which reveals more about the personalities of the duo than the film).<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. is the heart and soul of the film, optimizing both the dramatic and comic aspects. The Pepper character is just as strong, caring and competent as ever, though her sports bra superpower moments also seem added -- Pepper was plenty strong already folks, without supplements.<br /><br />The special effects are of course, top of the line, especially in the home destruction scene. What is truly remarkable is the nail-biting aerial rescue as the people plummet through the sky. This is what makes this kind of film great. Yet, the climactic battle scene is just one explosion after another, with as many Iron Man suits as they could fit into the scenes -- again, seeming to come from someone saying, \\"Let's cram in a lot of suits?

B00FEHXCIG|3.0|I'm too far in not to watch at this point. I have watched every movie that is a part of this Avengers franchise. I typically don't agree with the overly harsh criticism.  This movie was written for selling toys to kids. Of course it was super high quality production with explosions having explosions, but it was just too hokey even for a comic book film. Ugg I meant graphic novel. Sorry geeks. Anyway it reminds me of the way two little boys play together. &#34;Well my dinosaur eats yours&#34;. &#34;No mine has a force field&#34;. &#34;Well mine has a thing to break force fields&#34;!  No matter what you do to Iron Man or Starks, there is always something better. Instead of just bringing &#34;better&#34; at the beginning he tries really hard to construct it with bubble gum and a 9 volt battery only to end the end call on &#34;better&#34;. This movie could be over before it starts. This guy has more than the gross national debt in technology in is house but not even a basic air defense system on his home?  It didn't even have a good after the credits scene. :(
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Originally posted at Vampire Book Club<br /><br />Cinder takes place in a distant future about 123 years after World War IV devastated civilization. The Eastern Commonwealth now has to deal with Letumosis, a plague that is slowly spreading throughout the city. The palace is working fastidiously to find a cure.<br /><br />Cinder is a mechanic in New Beijing. After a terrible accident five years ago, she's now a cyborg. People don't look too kindly on cyborgs, so Cinder mainly keeps to herself and gets her work done. She's happy being lost in the crowd that is until Prince Kaito comes to her booth at the market in need of her skills. Soon Cinder finds herself embroiled in the middle of a possible intergalactic war with the Lunars and her mysterious past may be the key to everything.<br /><br />Cinder is, of course, a retelling of Cinderella. I liked Marissa Meyer's take on the fairy-tale and the changes she made in making it her own, but regardless of these changes there is still the familiar story that many of us grew up knowing. With that familiarity, however, comes a lot of predictability. Throughout the story I felt like Meyer tended to lead me into the directions / conclusions where I were supposed to be instead of letting me get there on my own. It made for less surprise during the big revelations.<br /><br />Cinder was such a sympathetic character. She was adopted by a man who died soon after of the plague. She then became the ward of a woman who looks at Cinder as the cause of the loss of her husband. While her oldest stepsister sides more with the mother, Cinder is offered respite in Peony, the youngest stepsister whom has real affection for her. When Peony falls ill of the plague, once again Cinder is looked at with disgust by her stepmother and offered up as a \\"volunteer\\" for a plague vaccine (which has not boded well for said volunteers). She is mainly ashamed of her cyborg status so very few outside of her family know. Despite her strife, Cinder remains strong and she's determined to get away from her current living situation. If only the Prince would stop asking her to the upcoming ball.<br /><br />The added conflict of the Commonwealth and the Lunars was a nice twist. The Lunars are a people who live on the moon, known for their ability to glamour and control feelings. The motives of Levina, their Queen, for peace with the Commonwealth are unknown, but everyone knows of her deceptions and agrees she is not to be trusted.<br /><br />The romance in the book was slightly unconventional. Meyer certainly didn't follow a pattern in that regard. For all that I thought was predictable, I still didn't want to put down the book, and Meyer did surprise by leaving us with an open ending. This is definitely a series where we may have to wait until the end for an HEA. I'm very interested to find out how Meyer continues on with the fairy-tale retellings while weaving together the overall conflicts she started here in Cinder.

B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a fun game and a great time killer. If you like this, you'll like Cross Me (which is a free game). Reason for only 4 stars, I have to post this review to get to the next level. Other than that, I highly recommend.

B000069KGM|4.0|Great songs and OK sound quality. The mastering could have been better. I was not much of a Chicago fan but happy with this addition to my collection.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Update: The game eventually ran fine and my son absolutely loved it. The hard-mode is a bit ridiculous and requires usage of the clunky attack items but for the main game it's worth a buck.  Old Review: After every level is finished the game crashes, sometimes remembering you finished and sometimes not.  Motorola Photon with Gingerbread 2.3.15.
B000069KE0|4.0|Some Great songs and OK sound quality. The mastering could have been better, as previous reviewers have noted. I was not much of a Chicago fan but happy with this addition to my collection for the low price I paid.

B00004RD54|5.0|First heard this album when returning back to &#34;the world&#34; after doing a stint overseas in the Marine Corps.  Some guy named Henry (don't remember if it was his first or last name now) who claimed that I really needed to hear the newest Lou Reed album.  Henry was right, we played this till the tape busted (we used cassettes back them).  A better live guitar assault by Hunter and Wagner is nowhere else to be found.  It is the rocking-est album EVER by Lou Reed in my opinion.  A timeless classic that should be in every rock fans collection to say the least.  The intro to &#34;Sweet Jane&#34; is worth the price of this alone!  Note:  Be sure to turn it up full blast!
0142403873|5.0|My whole family loves the Gruffalo tale! It is humorous, intriguing, and has a VERY tricky hero. This will become a classic!
B0058SNIC6|5.0|Bought these for my lady friend, my wife. She loves them. Just don't run in them, in the heat, they don't breathe, which is to be expected... but if you are chasing little ones around sometimes you don't have time to change your shoes! Other than that, it took me sometime to talk her into a pair of Crocs. I was a believer, so I bought her these. Now she is on the bandwagon, and drinking the cool-aide from a garden hose.
0142407542|5.0|This story is an awesome continuation of the Gruffalo! My grand kids love them, as well as the Gruffalo in Scots!

B00BKTFABE|4.0|Since there wasn't already a camera installed on our Kindle Fire, I found this one. I like that it takes some simple pictures and videos. I had a blast with my two year old making videos right away. As others have said, it's silly that the Kindle Fire doesn't have a camera on both sides, but it's still not impossible to take a picture. I also wish the Kindle had a flash, but it's not the end of the world. Anyway, the app does just what is says it will do.
0316098515|1.0|I have to say this is the most frustrating cookbook i own. I just can't wrap my head around the fact that there are no accurate measurements in the book. I can't say how disappointed i am. why would anyone go thorough so much trouble producing this book and miss something so fundamental?
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Bought this CD after seeing Diana Krall perform in concert on tour promoting the album.  She's a wonderful performer -- and enjoyed the show enough to purchase the CD.  Very talented pianist, singer, arranger, raconteur -- but I enjoy some of her earlier works better.  That said, Krall's interested in showing versatility and range in her work -- for an artist, nothing wrong in that.<br /><br />Though the cover art for the CD may not suggest it, the album has a rather nostalgic feel -- Krall is revisiting some pieces from the '20s and '30s that formed part of her father's record collection.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed this story about an indentured servant brought up in the slave quarters. Characters were developed well, although Marshall's behavior was odd and needed work. He was pretty much a nasty guy except for a couple instances where he was kind to Lavinia and those where the problematic points. Authors are told not to make their bad guys totally bad; give them at least one good quality. I don't completely agree and The Kitchen House is a story in point. Marshall's period of kind behavior is so out of character as to be unbelievable. There's no explanation why he's kind to Lavinia, And after marriage he's a complete jerk. So why those fleeting moments of kindness? I've found this problem in other books, not just The Kitchen House. It's annoying. But, overall, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to fans of historical fiction, particularly the period before the Civil War in America.
0143115014|4.0|A terrific overview of perfumes in current production as of 2007-2009; very comprehensive.<br /><br />The reviews are interesting, often amusing -- but in most instances do not provide fragrance notes.  The authors are widely respected authorities on perfumery, and their opinions and anecdotes are the basis for the text.  Great fun to flip through, learn about a lot of new scents to explore/consider.  I believe the book format is better suited than e-book, for the ability to flip pages and follow your whims in looking one to another.  This edition has an index of perfumer houses in the back, which is helpful to find specific perfumes you may want to locate in the book.  All in all, an excellent reference.
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|Works as promised, easy to install. Works in a n umber of flight sim games I own and the controller software does not appear to have bugs or calibration issues.- Excellent packaging.

B00005NG9Z|4.0|A testimony, if you will, to the best band of the 1990's. For some reason  they were lumped in with the &#34;grunge movement&#34; which really wasn't a movement at all.... it was a backlash to all the lame-ass fake poodle hair bands of the 80's by musicians that appeared not to shower regularly.
B00E7SXRHY|4.0|I will not discuss so much the musical content, as it is a 20-year old album that has stood the test of time, time and again. It changed my life, and changed many other people's lives as well. It made me pick up a guitar and play music, and it encouraged me to stay true to my musical vision, even when other people pressured me to just play \\"normal stuff\\" or other people's hits. Even the episode involving the remix of 2 songs did not upset me, because when you are recording you have to make a lot of difficult decisions, and everyone has reservations about their record when they finish.<br /><br />Having said this, the inclusion of Albini's original mixes is welcome, and I definitely prefer his versions over scott litt's ones (Including that wonderfully violent effect on the guitar solo of Heart-Shaped Box!).<br /><br />Regarding the vinyl package, it is solid and the vinyls are well protected. The quality of the sound is truly admirable, and it speaks volumes of Albini's abilities in mixing and mastering. From this point of view, this release should stand as a reference work for other reissues. All in all, the music in this record received the treatment it deserved. It is important to note that the dynamic range of this vinyl is superior to all the digital and cd releases.<br /><br />My complaints are just minor ones, such as changing the original albums' back cover for a very uninspired one. They should have  kept the original art (perhaps without the track listing), and sent the track listing into the inside of the disk, into a booklet. Another complaint is that there is no booklet at all, no lyrics, nothing. Just a download code sheet.<br /><br />The vinyl rip itself is a welcome, yet bizarre thing. I appreciate this gesture (although a lossless option would have been ideal), but it is debatable whether it is really necessary to hear the needle drop for 10 seconds at the beginning of Serve the Servants, or the large empty space left untouched to represent \\"changing sides\\". Also, in Scentless Apprentice, the beginning of the mp4 file completely misses the first drum beat, which is an inexcusable error.<br /><br />Also, why did the vinyl not include the 2013 mix? A lot of people would be willing to pay more for it (or maybe they only realized this after hearing the CD version), I think.<br /><br />But all in all, it's an excellent reissue and the band should be proud of a job well done. You can buy this vinyl assured that the sound quality is there.
B00COH32L6|5.0|What more could you ask for?  One of the best romantic comedies of all time and a great showcase of the city of New York.
0307271080|5.0|It takes someone from somewhere else to recognize the tribalism in America, and Adiche describes it so well.  She also addresses the issue of women who allow themselves to be victimized and the very precarious position many foreign students find themselves in while in the American Higher Education system.<br /><br />No one is left unscathed in Adiche's frank appraisal of posturing academics, ex-patriots of all kinds,  shop girls, hairdressers, and corrupt business people and politicians.  She even presents her protagonist in an unflattering light at times.  Yet her protagonist is uncompromising in her search for true love on her own terms.<br /><br />While I am neither Nigerian nor black, I was fortunate to have lived in an African country and, upon my return to America, made similar observations as Adiche does in Americanah, so her book rings so true.  I would hope books like Americanah make Americans less insular and more interested in people from other countries.  I hope more Americans will take an interest in foreign students and take the time to learn something from them and when needed, to help them.<br /><br />To top it all, Adiche writes beautifully.

B005544TRQ|4.0|This was a bit of a surprise to me since this show ignores current events, fictitious politics and other political issues (like gay marriage or abortion).  It is focuses on cases revolving around businesses and the drama around their own firm.  The characters are funny and interesting.  I will be keeping up with this one.

B008JFUNKU|5.0|This is what film-making is all about! With Paul Greengrass (\\"United 93\\" and the \\"Bourne\\" franchise) at the helm, we know we are in for a PG-13, white-knuckle ride. We see the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama container-ship taken by pirates off the coast of Somalia in 2009, the first such hijacking in two hundred years.<br /><br />The script by Billy Ray (\\"The Hunger Games\\") is based on (Captain) Richard Phillips book, \\"A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea\\" which depicts these events from his personal experience.<br /><br />Although we are already familiar with the situation from 2009 news accounts, we see the wildly contrasting lives of our principals: the high-tech environment enjoyed by modern maritime workers, as opposed to the starkly marginal survival of the Somalis who are assigned the task to \\"Go get us some money!\\" I was fascinated by the ubiquity of khat, the mildly addictive African narcotic used in Muslim countries because alcohol is forbidden. Chewing these leaves dulls the appetite, which makes life there more endurable.<br /><br />We have:<br />  * Tom Hanks (\\"Cloud Atlas\\") as our eponymous (and resourceful) hero, a fellow who insists he is anything BUT a hero. He says, \\"You just do what you have to do.\\" ...but he does PLENTY, in extremely trying circumstances!<br />  * Barkhad Abdi in his first film role, plays Muse (\\"Moo say'\\"), the Somali captain of a primitive pirate boat, desperate and wily. His ultimate goal is to \\"go to America.\\"<br />  * Faysal Ahmed is Najee, a big, gun-waving Somali who becomes increasingly frenzied as the full might and power of the United States military (WITH Navy SEALS!) surrounds their tiny lifeboat.<br /><br />There were many wonderful characters but I won't devote any more space to them. Instead, I urge you to see the film and tell me if you agree that the last ten minutes will earn Mr. Hanks another Oscar. Our screening audience applauded and you will applaud your DVD from Amazon.<br /><br />Kudos for the sound, photography, art direction, set design, script, and acting. Yes, even though I almost succumbed to the \\"Stockholm Syndrome,\\" I was really impressed by this one!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love this app...for a change, you can actually make progress without spending any real money!!! An honest to goodness free app. Yes, you DO have the option to spend$$, but it is totally possible to play for free...and the graphics are great.

B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I'm a writer and I downloaded this app so I could put prompts and chapters in here and write at work.  I picked this one over others because I can password protect and some of my writings can be a bit too... racy for there.<br /><br />I've already filled up 1 notebook with prompts and I must say that I love the fact I can put 1 prompt per page and change the amount of pages in a notebook (some of my prompt groups are way more prolific than others.)  I also like that I can do a notebook for whatever prompts came from where (and password protect any adult ones!) This lets me to an extremely basic browse before I even open a notebook, as different groups post different types of prompts.  Its exactly what I was looking for when it comes to that.<br /><br />While there are ads on the free version, I personally don't find them obtrusive.<br /><br />That said, there are a couple things I wish were different:<br /><br />1) I wish that when you opened a notebook, it would open onto the table of contents instead of the last page you were working on.<br /><br />2) It would be awesome if there was some way to mark things in the table of contents (i.e. things that I'm actively working on, things I have brainstormed, etc) - whether it be by highlight or letting you put a star or something.  The only way to do this currently is to write a note in the title line and, since its not highlighted or anything, the notes don't really stand out.

B005LAIIQC|4.0|At first I was reluctant about this movie.  Having seen the original trilogy, I wasn't sure what to expect.  To say the least I was greatly surprised.  Although the movie ties in Jason Bourne, it is a separate plot line that leads you in a different direction.  I'm glad I bought the movie and I recommend it to any action movie lovers!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I bought this movie for my nephews to watch before they go to bed when they visit.  We had taken to the Despicable Me 2 at the theater, but hadn't seen the first one.

B006BAEQB2|5.0|I really like historical fiction and Phillipa Gregory has been one of my favorite authors!  This is by far one of her best books.  It is told from the viewpoint of Anne Neville, the daughter of Earl of Warwick.  She is a young girl at the beginning but is already enveloped in an adult world as part of the the Royal Court.  It personalizes her struggles with her mother, Queen Margaret D'Anjou and Queen Elizabeth.  Her relationship with her sister Isabelle is one of comfort and closeness and also one of pain and resentment.  As the book progresses, you can see how Anne matures and becomes a strong women and fulfills her father's dream of seeing one of his daughters sit on the throne of England.

You did the crime, Piper, whether it was a decade old or not. QUIT whining.<br />Perhaps, if she were to expound on her prison friends, it would have had more substance...UGH!!!!
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Everything met my expectations. I ordered this befor I realized that I already had a copy of this movie but I will live with my mistake.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|These are nice little Lego sets for any MineCraft enthusiast.  Be warned that these are micro Lego sets, meaning all the blocks are the tiniest that Lego makes.  These almost lose a star because of how small they are versus their price, but it is what it is.  My son really likes them.  My son did say that he wishes the set came with less &#34;Ghasts&#34; and more &#34;Zombie Pig Men&#34;.  I'm sure your little MineCrafter would know what that means.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|I was well pleased with the delivery time and with the product it's self.  I should think that should be saying enough.  If I'm going to have to give a lengthy disertation on everything I buy I think I might stop giving feedback.

B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is really fun!  Give it a try!  It will make you think but is very user friendly yet challenging!
B00EPQQ2PW|2.0|One hit wonder with Bastilles single &#34;Pompeii&#34;. The lyrics for other songs on the album are repetitive and uninspiring. Instrumental for &#34;Bad Blood&#34; follows the lyrics in its bland and repetitive style.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you don't have this game, then I really am speechless about that. This game is my life it's not really but I love a lot and you will to.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Kevin Spacey is a fantastic actor. Best series I have seen in years. Come on season 2! 2014 is too far away...
B005D4YOHI|5.0|This is a very comfortable pair of sandle and very durable..I rily like these shoes more than every pair of shoes I have...thank you guys...
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Excellent twist at the end. Great read. Gillian really draws you in and doesn't let go until the final page.

B004DEW9L2|5.0|Never seen a Godard film before, so this was a delightful treat. Plan on watching it again eventually. I recommend this to all film geeks and people who are fond of the French.
B0025WX2YW|4.0|I like the historical aspect and the acting and production quality is very good.  I only give it 4 stars because it gets just a tad boring at times.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Purchased this as a gift and initially thought I had to &#34;endure&#34; watching it with my significant other. However, it is actually a good movie with some great talent present as far as the singing involved. Some really funny parts throughout and overall an easy one to watch without having to follow a complex plot or be bored out of your skull at another &#34;chick&#34; flick. I'd watch this several hundred times over rather than the opening credits to Twilight!
B009LDD22U|5.0|I've only've watched about half this season so far, but it's great!  It's continuing to evolve the characters and making them each unique.  In some ways they are flat, but that helps enable many of the entertaining situations the writers put the characters in.  Love the Blu-Ray/DVD format too!  Can watch the show on my own time when the kids are sleeping and no commercials.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Bought this as a gift. I don't want these and have no desire to start but from the feedback I received these were a popular selection. Easier to find on Amazon than what was available in the store and Amazon was several dollars cheaper.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|My reasons for NOT reading the much-hyped Wild made perfect sense to me. Oprah loved it, for one. I generally find Oprah-recommended books to be well written, but weirdly sensational and drama-ridden rather than subtly layered and nuanced. The hype for Wild also bothered me. In the past few years these overly publicized, consumer driven texts have rarely satisfied me as excellent reads. I often find myself speculating whether reviews had been \\"bought\\" because the gap between hype and actuality is so startlingly wide. Neither was I much interested in hiking or wilderness tales. So when a rain-engendered spell of boredom and the sudden availability of the kindle edition at my local library coincided, I reluctantly gave it a try. I ended up loving it.<br /><br />Strayed's voice as a writer is at once compelling, conversational, and lyrical. I was impressed with the candor with which she described her own shortcomings, her questionable decisions, and her experiences on the trail. Her pacing was excellent, the flashbacks to the foundations of her story well integrated into her wilderness experience. Nothing was overdrawn or overly dramatic. I felt the heat, the cold, the encounters with dangerous wild animals and a variety of human beings, her delight in mundane comforts like Snapple and cheeseburgers and hot showers. I got to know the trail without too much description or drawn out history. And I closed the book with a smile and some regret.<br /><br />Wild is definitely worth the read.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Fun movie and the music/dancing choreography are great throughout. Price was on point and when shipping was combined with my other items this was a cheap date night entertainment.
B00DQVST76|5.0|Completely blew my mind away. Best Madonna concert ever. Madonna at her best she cannot be touched. Simply amazing !!!!
0345533666|5.0|I would recommend this legal thriller.  The \\"bad seed\\" element was frightening!  I am going to suggest Defending Jacob to my book club.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|TED is the opposite of the talking heads giving their opinion over and over,  In 20 minute segments you can open your mind to new ideas, rethink old ones, and be amazed by the creative thinking in the world.  Is every presenter dynamic, no.  Does every idea seem totally new, no. But, overall it is the opportunity to hear interesting people talking about what they are passionate about and have knowledge of.  This download will let you find out how interesting our world is.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|I'm waaaaaay behind but my kindle fire is awesome!  Now I get to see all 5 seasons!  1 down, 4 to go!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|All four seasons are available on Prime. Don't miss out! Haves vs. have nots, independent thinkers vs. traditionalists, hamlet vs. town...
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Especially the incredible scenes with Grant running away from a diving airplane. Beautifully filmed, scripted and timed, rarely if ever are movies made like that any more. A must see.
B00AW0DM8K|5.0|Lovely lovely story, especially for fans of Harukami.  Ruth Ozeki deftly blend the real and the imagined so smoothly that you're not sure which you enjoy more.  She tells the intertwined tales of Japanese women in different places at different times.  I learnt more about the Fukishima disaster reading this book than in all the news programs I follow.  Ozeki has a real knack for story telling and for crafting complex, lovable, beautifully flawed characters that you commit to immediately.  I most sincerely look forward to her forthcoming works.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Very good. This season is great. TNG rocks. It ties season 2 to 4 very well. Very suspensfull. Very good
B00514HDNW|5.0|This book was addicting. I couldn't put it down. It keeps you interested and it had some scary moments. It was good.
0743297334|5.0|This book is exactly the one my daughter's teachers/school required.  I am impressed with the service because the book arrived within days.  And the best part is that it was less expensive than if I had bought it through the school's bookseller.  I will never buy another schoolbook from the school's bookseller without looking in Amazon first.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Loves this book!  If you have seen the movie it won't hurt ;if you haven't seen the movie, you should. Quick and happy read.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I recommend to everyone! Unknown facts and research findings put together in a convincing, and witty, language. This book can change your life for better, and for good.
1616614609|5.0|As with most Fantasy Flight games, the rules are daunting the stack of  cards is a little confusing.  But after a playthrough the game is easy to get the hang of, plays quick and is lots of fun.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this, my daughter uses this.  We LOVE the ability to customize. It is a great product with a lot of versatility.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|We watched  Season 6 and laughed and laughed.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys comedies.  Looking forward to Season 7.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|That's what my kids say to this game. They loved the movie and enjoy having more time with the adorable minions! :-)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I had gotten this book as a freebie give-away from Harlequin months ago & started reading it, but didn't get more than a chapter or so in & forgot about it until I got it through Amazon. Once I started reading it again, I realized it was the same book & figured I probably wouldn't finish reading it this time either since it hadn't caught my attention the first time.<br /><br />Now, I don't know why it didn't capture my attention the first time because I really enjoyed it and read it in 1 day this time. The characters are fun & the story is different and refreshing. I'm glad I gave it a second chance.
B005DVJQHY|2.0|Thought it was more of an inspirational book, which is what I was looking for. Just not my type of book
B008Y212PI|5.0|I want to sure about this game when I downloaded it since it seems most puzzle games ate just an excuse to soak youGreat concept, good graphics, lots of fun
B00AREIAI8|2.0|If you thought you were going to ride this house you were wrong this game is down definitely for young kids. I got it by mistake thinking I would be able to explore a world but I was wrong.kind of boring
1612680011|5.0|i want to seriously frame this book. such an amazing book put together very well. you dont have to own a house or a car to understand the message. life changing book!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Wow! This App is really great. It is a good way to learn a second language. Plus you can hear it spoken to you.
B003U4ZQUM|3.0|I rated the first four seasons at four stars but by season 5 the characters are beginning to get old. Perhaps the writers should have killed off a few more main characters and introduced some new blood.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It's pretty cool my daughter loves it and i like it myself she says the balls are pretty colorful too
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|One good movie, we'll acted, frightening to think we are dealing with people that truly hate us. Don't miss this movie.
B00594XOZU|2.0|Kik was one of my favorite apps. It allowed me to chat with my friends study and talk about clothes and homework.<br /><br />I logged out so that no one would see my private messages and it won  let me log in! This makes me so angry because I need to check some things.<br /><br />Please fix this error asap because I used to really love this app.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I like all his books, but it was too short a read for  the cost of the book.I loved the characters!
0140025146|5.0|I can't believe I didn't review this sooner.  This purchase is probably about the third or fourth as I either lose one, or loan out.  George Mikes has a keen sharp wit that is dead on.  Makes the simplest observations hysterical.  This is a book every Anglophile should own. over and over again.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Very suspenseful, riveting, and a great finish of the trilogy. I will definitely have to retread them all again. Done.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I loved this book it is one of my favorites I finished it in merely a week! I won't spoil it for you so read it for yourself!
B009UVWBMA|5.0|There is not a song on this CD that I do not like.  You can play it from song one to the end and jam out.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|I just found this app and am excited to use it. I know it's not the full Photoshop computer version but as a designer I can use it for simple jobs on the go.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|thank you fast ship just as said book is in good shape all text books were fast and accurate just as ad said
B0064W667Y|4.0|I saw this mentioned in connection to the TV series &#34;Once Upon a Time&#34;, which is a very different take on a similar premise of fairytale characters living among us. The story is a good whodunit, and I assume the later volumes get better once the characters have been established. This was a Kindle daily deal, and I liked it, except for the artwork which seemed a bit stiff at times. Sadly the later volumes (of which there are many) are much more expensive. I would have liked to continue reading.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|thank you fast ship just as said book is in good shape all text books were fast and accurate just as ad said
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I am late finding this show.  The idea of a chemistry teacher making drugs never appealed to me.  My adult children all love this show and three of them are in the film industry.  They told me it is extremely well-written, filmed well and talked about it so much,  I decided to give it a try.  I was hooked from the first episode!  The characters all have depth and I love the interaction.  I am almost to the end of this season.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|thank you fast ship just as said book is in good shape all text books were fast and accurate just as ad said
B006AN78XS|5.0|'Midnight In Paris' is one of my favourite films from the woodster, a surprise late period box office smash, and even non woody people may well enjoy it. It is a film that emanates charm, one of the most perfectly cast films I've ever seen, with multiple cameos all integrated extremely well performing one of Woody Allen's best scripts ( it won the oscar i think).<br /><br />Woody doesn't try to say too much in terms of big questions and that is absolutely fine by me. When he gets it right in terms of the comedy as he does here it has me coming back for multiple watches. He will go down as a comic genius first in terms of reputation, I believe, and an excellent filmmaker second. He has made some decent films in recent years where the comedy has taken a back seat: 'Match Point', 'Cassandra's Dream', 'Blue Jasmine'. I don't have the same urge to rewatch those ones although I do rate them. The ones I would rate as his absolute artistic best overall are as below with the feel good 'Midnight In Paris' being a comeback of sorts:<br /><br />Crimes And Misdemeanours<br />Husbands And Wives<br />Everyone Says I Love You<br />Celebrity<br />Midnight In Paris
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|This album is awesome. Tegan and Sara did pop music right. It definitely has an 80s flair to it. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves Tegan and Sara, to anyone who is a fan of the 80s, or to anyone who has been in love. All Messed Up is one of the most heartbreakingly beautiful songs I have ever heard.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|An extraordinary personal memoir of the ghastly horrors inflicted upon naïve, idealistic young men by ignorant, ambitious, incompetent, and psychopathic politicians, academics, media meatheads, and other assorted morons who callously send young men into the jaws of death while they sit back in safety and enjoy their own comforts, freedoms, and sinecures. As someone once said, \\"nothing is impossible to the man who doesn't have to do it himself.\\"<br /><br /> Such experiences were repeated hundreds of times in thousands of other locales around the world as tribal barbarism was practiced on a global scale by political fanatics who misappropriated high technology created by a miniscule number of innovative engineering and scientific geniuses, to destroy rather than improve lives.<br /><br /> It's against the odds that the author, along with roughly perhaps twenty or so other young men, survived protracted combat in hellish conditions with the 5th Marines in both Peleliu and Okinawa against a fanatical, suicidal, and gratuitously barbaric enemy, out of an original number plus replacements in both theaters that must have amounted to between six and eight hundred men.<br /><br /> The main problem with war is that the wrong persons get killed.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Cute, challenging, and nice little touches (like upon completion replaying your performance on the level in a sepia-toned movie). It's a nicely done game that feels very &quot;finished&quot;. I'm happy to have it as the free app of the day, but would not feel I'd paid too much had it been a regular purchase.<br />I'm on the EVO 4GLTE. The graphics &amp; interface are great &amp; gameplay doesn't suffer being on a small screen (tho the graphics would probably be nicer on a tablet.)<br />My only complaint so far is that it plays loud energetic music when opened after download. You can turn it off, and I assume it will open silent next time, but if you download with someone sleeping nearby, at work, etc, I'd recommend waiting to open it.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Not necessarily my favorite Denzel Washington movie, but it's still one of my favorite movies of all time. I love movies where you're not sure who the good guy is until half way through, this movie lives up to that.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a big fan of Stephen King I have read most of his most of his books. I don't know if I have a favorite. When talking about his books I have always said The Shining was the scariest. Other than some of the Dark Tower books, it is the only one I had read twice. Now I have read it a third time and I am glad I did. Because knowing Danny Torrance's past helps with the present and the sequel Doctor Sleep. Is it as scary maybe not? Maybe it is. To some it may be. You can probably read it without having read the Shining but it won't be as compelling. And this book is compelling a book that kept me reading into the wee hours of the night something I seldom do anymore. I didn't feel the hair on my neck stand up but I had to know how Abra and Dan's confrontation with Rose the Hat would turn out.<br /><br />So read The Shining if you haven't. Do not think you can get by with having seen the movie that misses too much of Danny Torrance.<br /><br />Once you're ready read Doctor Sleep for like the author you will want to know what happened to Danny. It's amazing isn't it that authors wonder what happened to one of their characters. However, they do and Mr. King did and if you're a fan of his horror and remember the horror of The Shining find out. It is one of his best.

B001GM28HO|5.0|I really like this CD, great price and great shipping. Good songs. I like the variety of her songs on this album.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but have to this time around.  This is the BEST game I've played yet.  Awesome.  Can't wait for the next release.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I didn't like this movie as much as I thought I would. Everytime Russel Crowe or Hugh Jackman burst into song, I wanted to burst out laughing. The story was the original, which was good. But not my favorite rendition.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|totally rad easy to learn great fun had a blast going through zombie levels bomb bang boom gotta dig it
B005LAIHZE|5.0|This movie was really cool. The vampire hunter part, but also the background story of Abraham Lincoln. I love how the ending ties in with history. Neat moive, not for kids.
0345525558|4.0|Enjoyed the story. Will never look at flowers the same way. Will keep the book handy for consulting when doing flowers
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|How can you go wrong? Indiana Jones on Blu-Ray is great. Picture is good, the case is good and price was good. Great addtion to any Blu-Ray movie buffs collection.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book.  I would recommend it to any one.  Can't wait to read another book by Christian McKenna.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|This was a good movie. I was a bit disappointed with how little Liam Neeson and Alexander Skarsgard are in the movie. The other actors though really do a good job keeping the movie together. I love the &#34;old guys&#34; at the end!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This game is great. But one thing is that on the air plane on the kindle there is no way to complete it. Also on the hunting one you it is really hard to do it.
0140177396|2.0|Ordered it for my daughters class but she doesn't seem too interested in it.  It's a small book but she not reading it because it puts her to sleep.
1423424514|5.0|arrived in very good conditions, and it's a great book!! as it's mini, it's very practical. I loved it.<br />Thanks
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Great read about something that you don't really hear a lot about.  The everyday lives of North Koreans.  Much is said about the people who escape the prison camps, but these stories of everyday life are really compelling.  If you are interested in North Korea this should be at the top of your books to read list.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book turned me into a sixteen year old girl, all thanks to honey badgers (and you too John Green) best book I ever cried to. Now someone please help me explain to my wife my current situation...maybe I can track down this Van Houten chap. ;-)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very relaxing love the sound of rain and lightning it calms my over active mind &amp;<br />puts me right to sleep
B00A27X972|5.0|I really enjoyed this story, which is an interesting idea - a story of humanity as seen from the eyes of a visiting alien whose judgment of us gradually changes from disdain to appreciation.
B00AEFXZJE|5.0|I received them swiftly and they were all I expected! You always do such a great job with all of my orders.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|A show with strong writing and a quality cast. It's not my favorite show, but it's solidly good. I would recommend it.
0345529057|5.0|its my favorite series, I highly recommend all the books!!!!! and it will keep you reading and interested all the way through.
0062011847|5.0|I have read all of the Disc world series. Pratchett has made me laugh many times but this is the first time he's ever made me cry.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Is this game for playing or making people  pay for real money well what I know I didn't download the game yet (didn't play it )but in every running games you should buy game coins with real money and that sucks ;-)
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Good research on the lives and doings of the Julian clan during the time of Julius Ceasar, his rivals, his friends, and his nephew, Augustus.  Its sexy/raunchy, violent, and filled with the real attitudes of the time.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|This game is SO STUPID on the kindle...on the throwup one u cant wipe up the frickin barf..also the plane one...dont get me started it doesnt work.this gam  is beast on the iphone but sorry....its just not for the kindle
B001V7UXG2|5.0|If you are familiar with Wodehouse, you won't be disappointed.  If you aren't familiar, then Jeeves is a genius of the working class who is a personal manservant, with all the talents and secret snobbery that comes with that; and Bertie is a fun, silly, goodhearted and not very bright young marrigable man of independent means.  Jeeves is like a mentor of good sense, and gets Bertie out of many scrapes.  Photographed beautifully, it brings back the short lived world of the rich in London between the World Wars.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|I became fond of every character and appreciated the finely drawn personalities of each of them.  The writing for the series was true to life.  I was in my 50s and 60s when the series ran.  Every week there was something that happened in the young characters' lives that reminded me of the trials, tribulations and triumphs of my own teen years.  I appreciated being reminded of my life by identifying with the lives of the characters.  I was also transported back to the time I raised my three children alone.  There may have been some incident that didn't ring true in my life, but at this distance, I can't think of one.  I'm so pleased to have been able to buy every recorded minute at such a good price.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|John Cleese is great.  The scripts are funny and fresh.  Its a great venue for what is essentially a repetoire cast.  Cast works great together.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|An excellent book that I couldn't put down. Life on a slave plantation and the hardships. Also how they manage to bring humor and happiness into their difficult lives.  I just wish the ending was not rushed. The quick way the writer tries to wrap up the ending in one or two chapters was a disappointment.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|My husband and I both loved Broadchurch, season 1. The murder happened in a small seashore town in England. The plot and character development was excellent and kept us guessing until the end. After each episode we would discuss our various theories as to &#34;who dunn it.&#34; A real treat to watch and I look forward to season 2.
B008ALA6DW|3.0|I work at home a lot and move around from desk to chair to couch, just to keep it interesting (13.3\\" MacBook Pro, Retina). Unfortunately, Apple's mini-display-ports grip any adapter relatively loosely, and where that's only mildly annoying when I'm using it to connect to a monitor, it's a pain-in-the-butt when I'm using it for a network connection.<br /><br />The darn thing is constantly disconnecting as I shift position or slide the laptop around on a desk. Basically, if I touch the laptop at all while it's using this adapter, my VPN is interrupted and I have to tunnel back in. Boo!<br /><br />If you have a desktop-like setup and keep your notebook on a stand with an external keyboard/mouse/trackpad, use this adapter. If you plan of using your laptop in your lap, coffee shop, on top of a book, etc..., get the USB adapter. The USB connection is much more grippy:<br />[[ASIN:B00486070K B00486070K]]<br /><br />I've gotta add that Apple should have included this adapter in with the notebook. For many people, esp. prof users, an ethernet RJ45 port is _not_ optional. Once upon a time, Apple included all the adapters when they changed a connection port from the 'standard'. When did they become so unconcerned about compatibility? Douche move, IMO.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I loved this series when it came out and time has not changed my opinion at all. Good writing, production and performances make this a wonderful addition to my video library.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|Neil Gaiman is weird and wonderful, an imaginative storyteller that deserves greater recognition. This tenth anniversary addition is an essential part of any Neil Gaiman collection.
B0014DC0AK|5.0|...it should be 1995's SYMBOLIC. Although Death had several quality albums, SYMBOLIC is their magnum opus.<br /><br />Chuck Schuldiner (vocals/guitar/composer) started Death as a \\"death metal\\" band in the mid-80s, arguably the first death metal band, but quickly broke out of that one-dimensional label. He was just too amazingly talented to be restricted to that genre's juvenile limitations. SYMBOLIC is Exhibit A in displaying his genius.<br /><br />Here's a quick rundown of the songs:<br /><br />1. \\"Symbolic\\" is a strong opener.<br />2. \\"Zero Tolerance\\" has always been my favorite song on the album. What an awesome bridge/chorus. Incredible.<br />3. \\"Empty Words\\" starts out with a quiet melodic piece that soon kicks into the main stanza which expertly segues into another potent chorus.<br />4. \\"Sacred Serenity\\" is also a standout track, but it's hard to put into words. I'll just say that the song has melody and many hooky parts.<br />5. \\"1000 Eyes\\" is a thrashy number with cool drum/guitar dynamics.<br />6. \\"Without Judgment\\" is another solid track featuring an exceptional melodic piece at about the 3-minute mark.<br />7. \\"Crystal Mountain\\" is my second favorite song on the album. The mixture of technical heavy riffing with beautiful melodic parts is striking.<br />8. \\"Misanthrope\\" is another thrashy number with a cool chorus break and melodic post-chorus piece.<br />9. \\"Perennial Quest\\" is an epic closing number that runs 8:23, my third favorite; the last two minutes is a potent acoustic instrumental, the perfect way to end this masterpiece. It's so moving, so haunting, so... beautiful.<br /><br />Like ACT III by Death Angel, OMEGA WAVE by Forbidden, NOSFERATU by Helstar, HAMMERHEART by Bathory and THE DEEP AND DREAMLESS SLEEP by Meliah Rage, Death's SYMBOLIC is a metal treasure where you just press 'play' and take in the expertice.<br /><br />GRADE: A+
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a nice game of solitaire, clear and fast on the Kindle Fire.  A real keeper on my device.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I bought for Royals but really enjoy all the music on this album. Looking forward to more by Lorde. Enjoy!
B00A0SICYI|4.0|I don't think i ever watched this as a kid......and had heard of it, so i thought let's watch it......took some persuasion but, my 3 girls ended up really liking it.  It was a fun, family movie w/o violence, sex and cussing......refreshing not having to worry about what the next scene will bring while watching with the girls.  Recommend.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack is capable and a loyal friend, even if you' ex known him for only a few hours. Love his humor. This novel kept building to the inevitable showdown and the ride was great. The final ending scenes even greater. Highly recommend.
B004J4WLB4|1.0|Where was just the right amount of suspense and love to make this book a good read.  I also loved  the meanings of the various flowers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i enjoy the APP. I have the same one on my PAD and both a great to change a hectic pace.
B002SRQ214|3.0|Bought on May 11th, 2012. TODAY, September 04th 2013 the cooler just got broken... 1year regular use... no overclock... no extreme temperatures... no voltage issue.... nothing... Besides that, seems to be a good processor for actual games. Never had any issue with recent games (Graphic Card ATI Radeon HD 6870)
B00280LYIM|5.0|Yep, still enthralled will this series. Riordan never ceases to amaze me with his ability to intertwine old legend with today's world. Book five here I come.
B00BOUL9DM|3.0|actually I deleted this app because you have to buy coins if you cannot figure the answer, and run out of coins
B006VREHRS|5.0|It's Mohulland falls meet Miller's crossing mixed with the history channel. Lucky Luciano and Al Capone get their feet wet in the beginning of prohibition.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite reads--and that's saying something since I felt the first 25% or so was pretty slow.  This book has one of my favorite alpha male leads, and one of the best smart, strong heroines.  The action is great, the intimate scenes spicy, and the writing is witty.  I actually found myself chuckling out loud in places.  Great cast of secondary characters.  I have read some of the follow up books to the series, and although well written, they don't hold a candle to this one.  I can't recommend it enough!
B0046ECJBY|5.0|Great Book. Interesting to get to know a completely Otter view on China than the Mainstream opinion. Danke Herr Kissinger
B008Y212PI|5.0|You will not be disappointed. Download this game. No problems in the play and smooth action. So far a very enjoyable time.
B009PHRIKE|5.0|The former violinist from Zappa & The Mothers will amaze you if you check this out. Five albums at a decent price with terrific sound. My two personal favorites in this budget box set are \\"Imaginary Voyage\\" and \\"Enigmatic Ocean\\", however, all 5 discs are worthy of any jazz-fusion fan's attention.
0790729644|2.0|This movie I just had to give away. I didn't care for it.  Now the Good the Bad and the Ugly  That was  the best one of Clint's movies
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Once I started this book I couldn't put it down! An amazing story through the eyes of a dog. Loved it.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This is an awesome collection.  The quality is superb.  Columbo is fantastic in each one.  The packaging actually has the numbers wrong however.  There were 45 episodes in the seven seasons, and there were 24 movies.  So the total of episodes and movies is 69--there are not 69 episodes AND an additional 24 movies.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Awesome works great! Works great with my HP all in one printer. Have not experienced any problems yet. Give it a try.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|My type of movies. Appealing story about life in Ancient Rome, and I was interested since I was a chilled. Nude scenes don't hurt either.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|It`s a REALLY fun game. You can race with many cars, do stunts off ramps that you find on maps, really cool maps, MULTIPLAYER, nitro (can't have a good racing game without nitro), and very amazing graphics. I will say I had to delete a few apps to get it but that's probably because I have Dungeon  Hunter 4 too. :D But like I said before it's a great game.
B0072OFM28|5.0|My type of movies. Appealing story about life in Ancient Rome, and I was interested since I was a chilled. Nude scenes don't hurt either.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I could not put this book Down! Very well written and although the theme is very familiar, I still read and read until I was through.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|EVERY TIME I TRY TO DOWNLOAD THE UPDATE IT WILL NOT WORK! WHAT'S GOING ON. I CANNOT PLAY THE GAME NOW. ALL THAT COMES UP IS THE DOWNLOAD AND IT WILL NOT LET ME DOWNLOAD THE UPDATE. I HAVE SPENT MONEY ON THIS GAME AND AM EXTREMELY IRRITATED THAT YOU HAVE LOCKED THE GAME UP! IT IS NOT FAIR TO TAKE PEOPLES MONEY AND NOT DELIVER ON YOUR PROMISE. DO WE NOT PAY ENOUGH FOR THE KINDLE AND THE PRIME? NOT TO MENTION ALL WE PAY INTO YOUR GAMES. YOU GET PEOPLE HOOKED AND THEN TAKE AWAY WHAT LITTLE JOY THEY BRING. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!
0811879542|5.0|Wonderful book. After reading it to a 3 year old several times we just had to set up the easel and paints to see if we could paint the same size dots. Very creative and fun.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This series is down and dirty. I found it better to do a season marathon, I don't forget as much that way
B00F91RYL8|4.0|the movie delivered a lot more than I thought it would.  Nice twist on a biological warfare accident movie.  I especially like the premise that if you pay attention and apply critical thinking it will benefit you.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|A continuation of a well written series, This is unavailable during the season as I do not have Showtime at this time
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Big, easy to read.  Perfect travel alarm clock.  Used it on my last cruise.  Hard to beat for the price.  The Kindle must be plugged in to go all night.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|Review is from both the 11 track 2x12\\" LP (wonderful 220 gm vinyl & sleeves) & the standard CD versions. It's been a long wait for this (after more than a year & 3 singles). A female Bee Gees somehow springs to mind but there are many other styles as they straddle the current crop of other indie female led acts like The Jezabels, Daughter, Ms Mr, Warpaint, Au Revoir Simone, Anna Calvi etc. Track by track then here goes. 'Falling' heard many times before & 3rd single (10\\" pink vinyl :o) enormous, catchy & positive vibes. 'Forever' 1st single & their anthem of stop start magic with fine guitar & vocals by Danielle. 'The Wire' after a non inspiring first listen really gets to grow - Alana's vocal stands out. 'If I Could Change Your Mind' with earnest 80s style keyboards & rhythm this is desperate & shows genuine emotion. 'Honey & I' nice funky guitar plus Danielle's turning twisting soulful delivery is one of the album's best. 'Don't Save Me' (white 10\\" vinyl 2nd single) is really catchy \\"so baby, don't save me - if your love isn't strong\\" and creates a strong place here. 'Days Are Gone' title track & a fine steady arresting piece with great vocals (Alana's main lead though they all take turns) & Danielle doing the beautiful high vocal bits - probably the strongest new track here & captures the mood of the album as they reflect back on lost love, lost youth & mistakes made - incredible vocals by our trio. 'My Song 5' sort of Destiny's Child meets J.Lo is quite strange & is a grinding funk type outing with some heavy bass (least favourite here though). 'Go Slow' almost their anthem & one of the flips from their 1st single contains wonderful vocal gymnastics over the slow stop start funk & ricocheting beats \\"I'll be hurting from your heat heat heat heat....\\". 'Let Me Go' with Danielle then Este & brilliant live but it also works wonderfully here \\"let me go.....you know I'm not one for leaving\\". Final blast is 'Running If You Call My Name' with as always their impressivevocals buzzing around plus a fine production - sparse enough such that the beat & soul blends. Other than one slightly weak offering, plus better would have been 100% usage of real drums, then this is an excellent outing. Talent personified for a brilliant blend of indie, nu-folk, 80s pop, 90s r&b, 60s/70s harmonies, guitar pyrotechnics & possibly the album of 2013. Phenomenal.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Have this game on my PC and love it! So happy to have it on my Kindle Fire. Great graphics and sound effects.
B003FCVF6I|3.0|I enjoyed this book. It's about consoles mostly, and doesn't discuss the 8 and 16 bit home computer era which is a shame, but a pretty definitive history of consoles up to 2000.<br /><br />A 2nd edition would be great talking about 2000 - now
B006BQM762|4.0|Over all good movie, I would recommend to anyone that enjoys science fiction movies. This one will not disappoint you
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Quite surprising in that I don't normally read these type of books. I must say I just couldn't put it down.
B008Y212PI|5.0|this game reminds me slightly of sudoku for somereason. it is challenging but fun. I still haven't completely gotten the hang of the patterns, but I'm almost there!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Purchase songs quick, download them quick, or you can just play them from the cloud.  Haven't had any issues with it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a very,very emotional book. I'm glad I got the chance to read an amazing book. It truly shows how much you should appreciate what you have in life and to never take things for granted. I would totally recommend reading this book. I hope you enjoy. :)
B0058VW36U|4.0|I've had to look up a few levels on youtube but all in all this game is pretty good.  The super powers are OP as hell though.
B007THA4FI|2.0|So many angry, discontented characters in a small petty-sounding<br />English town. I had a hard time finishing this disappointing story<br />with its sad ending.
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|This is a great show.  Quality writing and acting.  Hard to stop watching it!  Claire Danes definitely deserves the Emmy for this role.
B00CSYR432|5.0|Like many of Studio Ghibli's realism films (as opposed to fantasy), not a lot happens in this movie. That's what I like about it. I love to immerse myself into another world where I am not inundated by chaotic plot twists, high speed chases, and tons of negative energy. This movie is the exact opposite. It is slow, quiet, and thoughtful, which is not to say that it is shallow. The emotions in this movie run deep, but the characters/director don't try to bash you over the head with them, but allows you to ride along and soak in the gorgeous scenery.  I am not Japanese and have never lived in Japan, but after watching this movie, I wish I could live in that idealized version of Yokohama in the early 60's. It actually made me nostalgic for a time that I was never part of!<br /><br />If you are looking for a fast paced, over the top extravaganza like \\"Spirited Away\\", this movie is not for you. This movie is also not really for kids. It's pretty \\"clean\\" but the pacing of the movie is geared towards grown ups. A mature, thoughtful middle schooler might enjoy it, but anyone younger than that might find it a little slow.
B00004RHZU|5.0|she is so beautiful.  some of the songs on this CD are Hell wit ya, private show, is it love and others.
B00000JMOF|5.0|I have always considered this a dramatic fantasy/science fiction movie.  Boris Karloff got the role that was originally offered to Bela Lugosi by Robert Florey, the proposed director of the film.  Lugosi passed on the role that would haunt and propel karloff into the new and emerging movie genre of classic and gothic horror.  Karloff plays the creation of Baron Victor Von Frankenstein (Colin Clive)who seeks the spark of life and creates life from death.  Edward Van Sloan (Professor Van Helsing) in Dracula turns up as the baron's mentor and professor.  Dwight Frye (renfield in Dracula) also turns up as Fritz, the baron's hunch-backed assistant.  Director James Whale, an emotionally-troubled man guided this film and gave us a classic of film-making.  This is a great film that still holds the audience's attention.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the action and details in the characters.  Definitely a pop corn show that keeps you engaged from beginning  to end.
B0070Z97LG|4.0|Daniel Craig, Rachel Wiesz, Naomi Watts and Elias Koteas are stellar in this deep and disturbing tale of a man who is scarred and healing from the murder of his wife and two daughters.  As he battles madness, he searches for the truth behind the tragedy.  This is an enormously entertaining but dark crime drama with solid acting and a solid script.  You will sense bits of Hitchcock and depalme as you watch this movie.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The product was awesome and i enjoyed reading it cant wait to read the next one in the series. It worked perfect on my tablet
B000035Z3K|4.0|Bella Lugosi brought his stage performance as Bram stoker's famous count to the screen in 1931.  he holds his own as an aristocratic count with a taste for blood.  His limited English speaking ability led to his few lines but he was able to use his facial expressions to frighten the audience.  Dwight Frye does steal most of the attention as the crazed but obedient Renfield.  Edward van Sloan plays a fatherly Van Helsing who almost falls to Dracula's control.  This film does not shock any more but it has plenty of character and gothic appeal.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Wow! This was extremely well acted and kept me intrigued to the very end.  The ending was surprising and disturbing and still makes me realize that we never know what is really going on in another person's mind.
B008PZZYB2|1.0|I like Ben Stiller but Zoolander was way too dumb for me. We didn't watch much of it, I couldn't stand to waste my time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Brilliant!  I love this series.  I thought it was nearly impossible to catchup on early episodes until the amazon video features were updated for me to stream from anywhere.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|The gameplay is similar to Bit Trip Runner, but more forgiving.  This is a very polished 2.5D game.  I highly recommend it.
B001AITH50|3.0|.... but.<br /><br />What's the movie about? Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt are vampires. Or rather AS vampires. I.e., giving a performance. Yes, I get it, all movies are, but... when it becomes how good a performance is rather than how good the film is, which inevitably happens here ... the film's got a problem. It's working against itself. And you can never overcome it however good the performances are -- and I for one didn't think Kirsten Dunst's very good.<br /><br />And Christian Slater... Always dangerous casting.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Fascinating look at the prison system. Much different than the show, but similar enough to get all the references. Made me want to behave!

0765365278|5.0|This is a really good book.  Great characters and world building are key and this book gives you that.  I used to think it was all about the action but I now realize that I like great characters and an original world more than even the action a lot of times...with that said the action in this book delivers as well.<br /><br />Do keep in mind this book is a monster at 1200 pages and the first of a projected 10 books.  Also keep in mind that because of the size of the book and the series this may be a bit slow in parts to some readers...to me though the detail and the building of the characters and world are a joy to read.  Brandon does not make this a chore to get through, I read this book as fast as I normally read books half this size.<br /><br />If you love epic fantasy, this will be worth your time.<br /><br />4.5 stars
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is an excellent tool for working on my various writing projects. I like that I can use and sync across my mobile device, Kindle Fire, &amp; laptop. It's a bonus that I can snap photos, record notes, and add attachment. An excellent resource for me.
B00874T02K|5.0|Great app! Tough workout. I started in week 3. I'm only on day one and already feeling it! I highly recommend this for a beginner or someone who needs to get back on track with their workouts.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love this show. Great characters. Humorous.I can tell this is one show I will hate to see end. I highly recommend it.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|I've been waiting for this record for sometime now and I'm not disappointed!  I just wished it was longer!  Maybe next time.
6305212112|3.0|It is a great movie but the dvd had some flaws in it which caused it to pause at times throughout the movie.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Enjoyable and well written -- Cheryl's bittersweet tale of her trek on the Pacific Crest Trail, what she learned about herself and what she encountered along the way. An excellent read!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a fast-pace, heart stopping race. My grandchildren are fighting over the Kindle to play it. My 10-year old showed me how to purchase terrains and vehicles with the points I had earned. That made it even more fun and challenging. This is a good game.
B004G0SJU8|3.0|the premise was good but the movie dragged on and on, it seemed as though we enjoyed the beginning and then the end, the middle not so much
B00AEVU2HQ|4.0|....the actual biography co-authored by the same is superb.  Still this was fun to read and provided some good background on the &#34;bloody laws&#34; which is helpful to know.
0399255370|5.0|This book makes me laugh every time I read it.....my husband is getting sick of hearing me read it to my friends and family.... I am a Hospice volunteer and I even read it to a patient (age 91) and he laughed and laughed !!  My 7 yr old great grandson is having a hard time reading (he gets bored) so I sent one home with him and he's promised to read me 4 of the letters when he comes back next time...I just keep ordering these because I can't stop giving them away !!  Great gift for the older sibling of a newborn who is feeling left out...So fun to read.... will never be without it.... BTW... I'm 72 years old and not senile yet !!  Highly recommend it for kids 6 and up and children of all ages...
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Can't wait to read the second book! A chapter or two a night was just right, even if my son always begged for another.
B00BGD8CFK|4.0|Nice case, thin enough to not be bulky, thick enough to actually protect the phone. My one complaint is the hard, sharp ridge along the bottom of the case right where my pinky sits when holding the iPhone. I used a nail file to smooth this out and it's fine now. But I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of this.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Read this as part of my book group and really enjoyed it. Recommended to several friends who all enjoyed it as well.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This app makes me read the rss news like a magazine. It is easy to use and to share. Well done
B006O5YHUY|4.0|Very good story, liked the competition, it was believable, didn't know who to root for til the end. I still was flip flopping in the end.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|One of the best movies ever! Plot was solid and this movie made me squirm in my seat for sure!
3836538725|5.0|I bought this one for myself and soon after it's arrival I purchased 3 more for gifts for friends >An out of the blue gift is really a surprise especially when it comes to their door from Amazon.This book is so beautiful and has captured the incredible sights that Salgado can get into print for those of us who do not have his talent,expertise or sense of adventure.Buy it before they run out and order a few for friends for the holidays.Send it to their office so colleagues can see how much they are valued as a friend.It's impressive!Once again Amazon has come through for me.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|wonderful book. good insite into how the body processes food.  I love the book and recommend it to anyone who is interested in find the true way to total health.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I ordered this in January.  Worked perfectly.  About a month ago I was carrying the Bose downstairs and somehow this converter along with the phone came loose and dropped.  No damage to the phone at all (had an Otterbox on it), but the CableJive wouldn't work anymore although I could see no damage to the pins at all.  I contacted the company and they immediately sent me a new one which works perfectly.  Can't get much better customer service than that.  Thanks CableJive!!!
B002SR2PKG|1.0|Completely inappropriate. Scary is fine. Dirty is not. No wonder this country is in shambles if this is what people find entertaining.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I went into the movie thinking I knew how it would end or the it would be mediocre, because it did not rock at the box office. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is epic. It is a must see for action fans.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|The game is quiet fun. Its basically a 3d runner. I only completed the first two levels but the graphics were good and the difficulty was OK.<br /><br />So far the only problem I've encountered is it crashes every time you quit.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Our whole family loves watching these shows.  they are quite excellent family time entertainment with out worry of inapproriate material.
0062073508|5.0|Murder on the Orient Express: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries) is classic whodunit detective starring one of Agatha Christie's most beloved characters, i.e., Hercule Poirot. Mr. Poirot is on his way on-board the legendary Orient Express on his way to Paris when a murder occurs. Now it is his task to find the killer. I absolutely loved it. Highly recommended.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|UPDATE: I reported to the factory the sudden dead of the device, but I did not claim any compensation. It it fair to mention that their Customer Service by their own initiave sent me a new unit without any cost for me. Received the unit after a month, this one works fine after 6 months of use until now. Excellent Customer Service to make me feel quite satisfied. I raised the rate to 4 stars. I recommend this little amp.<br /><br />UPDATE after two months of use:<br />It is a pity but the amp stopped to work suddenly, plugged in to charge but no red light turned on, tried to turn it on but nothing happened.<br />I was happy while it worked, but now I realize that is a low quality product.<br />Good service from amazon that made a refund to my credit card, 5 stars to Amazon customer service, 0 star to FIIO; great dissapointment.<br /><br />ORIGINAL COMMENT after one month of use:<br />I just recently purchased an over the ear Sennheiser PXC450 headphones, which sound as a charm, but they are high impedance headphones and as I hear music with my LG L5 E455 Android phone, I was first intended to use the FIIO to adapt impedances to prevent power loss. And this worked as I expected pretty well.<br />I am really impressed with the power the FIIO E6 adds and the clarity of the sound. As a music lover, I use to hear 240bit and up mp3 encoded audio files which is a real joy.<br />I also use to hear music with my in ear Sennheiser OMX 181 which have great sound clarity and music balance, but no so much bass gain. The FIIO happened to be the best partner adding sound power and bass enhancement, but in a pretty balanced way.<br />The amp has a compact design, very well finished glossy black case, with silver buttons. Very stylish.<br />When I turn on the Equalizer of the Player Pro I use in my phone, I use the 1st setting in the FIIO which is flat (light off). Music comes up with a powerful and crisp sound. That forced me to renew all my old mp3 music files to re-encoded +240bitones, because defects in bad sources are enhanced.<br />So, use even lossless music files (FLAC), or highly encoded mp3 files to have a fully enjoyable audio experience.<br />At this time I cannot give feedback about battery life as I charged the first time and I had not much time to test it, maybe I can give this feedback later on.<br />The only thing I would change in this product is the mini USB power inlet, I would prefer a micro USB as it is usual for all new products, which makes me keep two different cables one for this and one for the phone. But this is a minor issue regarding the quality of the product and the benefits it offers. It well deserves the 5 stars.

B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a good one simply because of the availability of playing different levels each session.<br />If you want victory, play easy level...
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|So you've always wanted to be a prize fighting chimp?  Then look no further and lace up your gloves.<br /><br />This game has great graphics in my Fire HD 8.9 and I love to dress my monkey up in a good variety of hats, glasses and so on.  You even get to train your chimp as you gain experience in the ring.<br /><br />I enjoy the game play with one small exception.  At times you get a special combo where you have to spin a wheel around really fast which is a bit challenging on my big Fire - might be easier on the smaller model.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Can be tough, somewhat frustrating good game!<br />To understand this game is to simply enjoy the challenge, think and have fun.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Too short but a great story lIne.  Graphics are good and its not hard to follow.  Wish these games had longer play.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is classic English history and culture.  I love both.  The series is authentic, customs are gorgeous, plot is fascinating and noone can beat Maggie Smith as the dowager mother.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written by an individual who doubted so much.  Being a scientist and not having too much faith all culminates during his &#34;brush with death!&#34;  I highly recommend this book to believers and non-believers.  He is explicit about his entire experience.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Set up was a breeze and streaming is incredibly simple. This is the beginning of the end for network tv!  Love this product.
B000063V8T|5.0|Star Trek, was terrific in its time, The Next Generation tried hard to follow. It did pretty well with some minor, not worth writing about. I would recomend this to anyone who like good quality writing.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|It's an older program that haven't watched before. It's well done and has a many characters which have varied selfish interests to move up the corporate lader .

B0012QRPU4|5.0|This is where it all started.  What makes it so gripping is that the premise is so believable.  It makes you crave the next episode like a meth addict.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a great read. I love books that have so much passion and love. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|No instructions. I tap on objects but they don't do anything. How do you even get started on this? Help
B003VPWX6K|1.0|I would certainly rate this book a minus five. I really can't understand how someone, with this kind of story, vocabulary, lack of pace, could have been granted a ward. All this means to me is that Great Britain is in dire need of literacy books. Do you want a summary of the book? Easy: think of a butler who goes on and on about dignity during a country side trip. Think of someone who is extremely proud of being a butler, have lots of pride in it, a pride that is insidiously, covertly present since the beginning of the book. This  is pure garbage disguised in literature. Don't even think of it, buying because of the movie, run while you still have time - the book and the movie are two worlds apart, choose the movie.<br /><br />P.s. The butler is also omissive and a little liar
159562015X|5.0|I run a VERY SMALL non-profit and am not the best at dealing with staff.  The hints at the end of each chapter on how to work with people with different strengths was well worth the cost of the book.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is the best game but I wish they'd gov  US more rewards because it's hard to get special characters so I wish they'd either lower the price on the special tour characters or they gov  US not  rewards for the thing  we do in subway surfers.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I'm biased since I'm a DiCaprio fan so this got 5 stars.  The movie doesn't bore, and the acting is great as usual in DiCaprio films.
1574214276|5.0|I love the creativity found in this book.  I was an artist wanna-be, but now I am creating pictures that have my friends and colleagues in awe of my &#34;artistic&#34; ability.  This technique is very relaxing and you begin to see the world around you in a different way.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Not boring but not particularly memorable as well.  It's a good movie to watch if you're bored I guess.  Would not watch twice, however.
B0000263H7|5.0|Along w/ Disengration and Bloodflowers its one thier best. It has a few commercial / radio friendly tunes that make the album a little less dark, but its still top notch.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This movie left me breathless.  I really miss LOTR but this movie was such a refresher of what made that whole series great.  Such a fantastic fantasy world with great ideas, story and acting.  Watch this, it maybe be the best movie you have seen that has come out recently.  I wish they made each book of LOTR into 3 separate movies as well!  Oh well...
B00APKIN1I|5.0|I always looked at Sound City like The Record Plant here in New York or Abbey Road Studios in London and it the history surrounding Sound City is mindblowing.  The likes of Nirvana's recording of &#34;Nevermind&#34; to Fleetwood Mac, Rick Springfield and Cheap Trick, you wonder what the walls would say if they had a voice.  Above all, Paul McCartney jamming with the surviving members of Nirvana, talk about generational history....Dave Grohl was in his glory.  Speaking of the Grohl-meister, this project really defines him, not only as an all-around musician as we know he is, but he has a great mind of how to put together a Martin Scorsese-like musical documentary.  All hail Dave Grohl!
B000OLRH10|5.0|I'm a huge DiCaprio fan because I really think he is one of the best actors around.  This movie really displays his talents.  The story is also very good.  This is should definitely be a must watch movie.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|It took a while to get into it, but now that  I'm halfway thru, I'm losing some sleep because I can't put it down.  It's a bit lengthy, but well worth it once you get thru some of the details in the early chapters.

B0065AR71E|3.0|I LOVE SKYRIM AND I REALY WANTED A HARD COVER GAME GUIDE BUT THE ONLY REASON I AM GIVING THIS A 3 STAR RATTING IS THE BOOK WAS DAMAGE AND IT WAS A SECCON ADDITION AND ADD DID NOT STATE IT...
0143116053|4.0|I honestly don't know if I like this book because it's so good, or if it's so good because I like it... There were just too many parallels with my own life: the academic partner, aging and eventual loss of parents, one partner starting a new career as the other's career winds down... Desmond Bates, a linguistics professor defeated by academic politics, is both hilarious and tragic as he attempts to deal with his evolving hearing loss. In his world, the word \\"deaf\\" is both comically and disturbingly paired with \\"death\\". Desmond's deteriorating hearing parallels his father's increasing debilitation. Of course, David Lodge presents all this with his usual humorous touches. For example, other authors might look back on the comic embarrassment of Desmond pretending to listen to a young graduate student at a party when in fact his hearing aid battery is dead. Lodge has his narrator go back, examine the event, and then present it as an academically pompous question the professor might have put on an exam: \\"First person into third person, past tense into present tense, or vice versa. What difference does it make to the effect? Is one method more appropriate to the original experience than another, or does any method interpret rather than represent experience? Discuss.\\" (You can almost hear him lecture the reader to pay attention because this WILL be on the final.)<br /><br />My main complaint with the book is that while the young grad student and her increasingly obvious emotional issues provide both comic and dramatic fodder, at the end she is simply a maguffin who fades out of his life and the action without any lasting or significant impact.<br /><br />But who cares? Not me, as I busily enjoyed Deaf Sentence on so many levels -- as a campus novel, a comedy evolving toward a tragedy, and most of all, a voice for so many elements of my own life. I'm guessing its genius is in the fact that their own connections are available for almost any reader.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I Love playing Uno.Will play all day if I could.FUN GAME.THE BEST.LOVE THE COMPETITION BETWEEN OTHERS THAT I DON'T KNOW.
B00A8LRIEW|4.0|This album is acoustically on par with New Order's &#34;Waiting for the Sirens' Call&#34;.  If you liked that album I'm sure you'll like this one too.  HELLBENT, I'LL STAY WITH YOU, and SHAKE IT UP are my favorite songs.

B009LDD54K|5.0|I can only say there had better be more than 4 Seasons or I'll send my boys uptown for some tax-time.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|This book is the third in the trilogy of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and continues to hold the suspense of the first novel, Shadow of the Wind!<br /><br />Based in Barcelona around and before the Franco period, the books imagery and story line read more like a classic novel. As a translation it is beautifully written.<br /><br />It is hard to put down!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Once you start, you just have to keep going. This game is totally addicting. I really like the \\"tap & go\\" feature, you tap your card and it lands on the correct spot. Have fun.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|My biggest complaint is that it runs the battery down pretty quickly in my Kindle Fire.  In one day Kindle was completely dead.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is a faithful adaptation to the original text but if you read the book you will notice that the one area lacking in the film is character development and emotional insight into Mr Thornton. Making the film 1.5-2hr longer would have allowed for this but it will not be noticeable to the movie watcher who hasn't read the book. The ending is also different but wonderful, although I think the original ending would have been marvelous too. I felt it was very well cast, direction, set and costume all excellently done. I've already enjoyed multiple viewings.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|It is a pretty good book on the life of a sniper, though it does did a little redundant after awhile.  Also kind of odd to read knowing what has happened to him.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|Love the game! I have gangstar Rio and I loved playing it. But then I got this games for $.99 and I have been playing it for hours! The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it sometimes turns off on me at the most random times. I also don't really think that you should have to download another stupid thing because on games like this there is no point for extra download. This game is like the greatest grand theft auto substitute! :)
B00013F38K|5.0|I am a David Carradine fan from way back when this series aired on the tv. I have watched the price for some time now and decided now was the time for me to purchase it. The first season was always my favorite and it lays out the kung fu character so well in all his complexity. If you like the martial arts movies you will like this series. At the time this first aired I was in the military and was practicing martial arts myself so this really gave me enjoyment. Thanks again Amazon the price was right.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|It came in right on time and was exactly what I wanted. It said like new, but seemed closer like brand new.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I love Star Trek TV series and movies. I have been a closet Trekki since Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock hit my TV screen. Got the movies Next Generation with John Luke Picard and so on. This was a natural progression for me to want to see the next installment of the new generation for Star Trek. I was not disappointed with the action nor the character development. The graphics also really popped on my PC. All in all the movie makers did a great job on this filmn.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book really changed my point of view on life. It helped me realize that life isn't about waiting for marriage and blah blah. My whole life I thought what I was so post to do is wait for marriage to have sex and stuff. But this book showed me that today is the best day and that I need to live day by day not planning because life is what happens while your busy making plans.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Could add bonus feature or something containing you laying more than one card down of the same kind, not color but by number

B00867GHS8|5.0|the movie came in just like i expected it to in great shape. Its had NO bents,no scratches, just like new!!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This movie is such a good depiction of the book and the events written about in the book. Brings to &#34;real life&#34; what my imagination has created time and time again when I've read the book. It's a must-see for fantasy enthusiasts.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game. It's easy enough for youngsters and difficult enough to keep adults interested. Good follow-up to their other items.
B001BANK32|5.0|Who needs Jack N.s &#34;Hereeere's Johnnny&#34;!!! this book is the real deal behind the Overlook Hotel. The psychic reality of the situation is wonderfully explained by Stephen, who I understand had alot of problems with the movie. This book is tough to put down, and even when you know there'll be a rescue, you still hang on with doubt. It is a true thriller.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is great, it's slowly replacing my my Roku. For the Price you can't beat it! A must have for your TV.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Unbelievably good plot and movie concept. Very fulfilling ending. This is a great movie to watch. No unanswered questions at the end.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It's nice to be able to check your weather from your Kindle and this app is the best  I have seen! ITS easy and user friendly! A great plus for anyone who wants to keep up with their weather 7/24!
B00F91G5BS|4.0|Good movie. Great concept and plot. Interesting ideology for global epidemic. Very believable and can see this happening in real life.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This was a great compelling series.  The british do a very great job. Characters are like real people just really good story telling!
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Awesome follow up to Iron Man 2. Loved the new suit that reminds me of the Knight Rider car. Great movie!
B003M6EAXM|5.0|The writers were too good at leaving 'cliff hangers'... Ahhh... I had to go directly to next episode some days to pick up the action, to see the outcome. Luckily, I used Amazon Prime acct. to watch when and what I pleased!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game, they just need to add more rooms. Also good for kids; my 9 y/o loves it :) Please update soon, we need more levels!!
B00E9P959O|5.0|The issues with the original 2002 release of Vapor Trails is covered in every review and even by the band themselves so no need to repeat. I will say that I had always hoped they would revisit this album and try to correct the mastering issues and boy did they ever. WELL WORTH the purchase. I bought the 2013 remix on vinyl and digital download and they both sound fantastic. Worlds apart from the original muddy and distorted 2002 release.<br /><br />There was a point when I couldn't sit through the original mix because it sounded sooooo bad. Not worthy of a RUSH release. it didn't do the songwriting and musicianship justice. The new version is a whole new experience, almost as if RUSH released a brand new album (a fantastic one at that!)
0762445262|5.0|the room has to be dark but it's still pretty cool.. just the right size not too big...just wish it had a push button rather that a switch on the bottom
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Visions of people dying in terrible ways haunt Nate's mind, but he's certain that they are only visions planted by what he thinks of as Outviews. He's only 16, but he's a boy no longer. He's a man. He has to stay strong, be courageous. His dad's been dead four years. Why exactly remains unknown, a secret. Nate blames himself. His brother was taken away to an asylum and no one will tell Nate where he is. If he could only find him, he'd be able to work it all out, get the Outviews out of his head, put his world back in balance again.<br /><br />I was reminded of the Wizard of Oz, which is no bad thing, as Nate sets out with three friends through time portals and across hidden dimensions to places as wondrous and evil as Brandt Legg can summon from his vivid and colorful imagination in \\"Outview\\", Book One of the Inner Movement Trilogy, and a thrilling start to what promises to be a compelling series. Legg clearly loves his character and tests him in every way, making him stronger, providing him with new skills and powers, which prompt us to believe that his destiny is inextricably linked with our own, the world, the universe and all things. Teenagers will enjoy this book. Adults, too. I did.
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Ever since I started collecting The Walking Dead figures, I've been kicking myself for not grabbing Daryl when he was first released. Like seriously, he was everywhere I turned and I just wasn't that interested. Then I started picking up Series 2 of the TV show and was like \\"man, I wish I had a Daryl figure.\\" Well if you're like me, then you're in luck with this two-pack. It's literally the same figure. All the same accessories and all that. Plus you get a variant version of Merle (the paint job on the original Merle from Series 3 is better, in my opinion. But this one isn't bad either). If you just have to have a Daryl figure then grab this ASAP. Don't spend $200+ on the Series 1 figure, unless you're a die-hard fan and just have to have it mint in box, but this one will do just fine.<br /><br />On to the figures themselves: Their range of motion is limited, while the figures started getting better in Series 3, they're still not great. You can get them into some cool action poses, but not many. Daryl is sort of built just to hold the crossbow, no that you'll want to pose him any other way. As I mentioned above, Merle's paint job isn't as great as his first figure, but still comes across looking like the character. Daryl's is not as a spot on in likeness, but still a good job. You can look at him and tell who it's supposed to be. McFarlane has certainly stepped up their game these last couple years.<br /><br />Accessory wise, Daryl wins. He comes with his crossbow, knife, axe, pick-axe and new to the figure: prison keys. Merle just comes with the standard handgun, knife and AK-rifle.<br /><br />These two a certainly a must have for TWD fans!<br /><br />Side note: A new Daryl figure is coming out as well in March 2014 based off his Season 3 attire and includes his bike. Just food for thought.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book highly to everyone that likes adventure, impossible outcomes and even a little romance kattniss and peeta \\"love\\" each other for all the action bravo Suzanne Collins
B0051MKNV8|5.0|This dvd is very good. Good story content. It's been a while since I watched it, can only remember that it was a good movie.<br />Don't remember for sure, but I think this is one of the stories, that takes forever to get interesting, then gets very good.<br />This seems to be more & more true with the movies coming out recently.<br />Assuming, you can wait that long before you take it out and abort watching it.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Well what can I say, this is just great! just to refresh last season and get ready for new one, good price and fast shipping like always!
B00C7DGQ9C|2.0|Dumbest film ever. Although i watched the whole thing. Kinda like a train wreck, i couldn't look away. Really bad
B000I8JF3W|5.0|Clint Eastwood plays a secret service agent who has never forgiven himself for not being able to protect President Kennedy from assassination.  He is continually trying to atone for that.  When there is a current death threat from a former CIA-Agent gone bad (John Malkovich), Eastwood's character gets his opportunity to make up for past mistakes by protecting the current president from assassination.  Will he be successful and preempt an attack, or will he fail again? There is some very suspenseful cat and mouse intrigue between Eastwood's good guy character and Malkovich's malevolent villain.  If you like Washington thrillers with agents and bad guys, you should sample this one.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have long been a Grisham fan but when he started working with ghost writes I lost my faith in his books. This book is more of his old style and I enjoyed it very much. The plot twist and turns like the Grisham books of old. I would recommend!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Nice cinematography and character development.  Very stylish space age accomdations surrounded by barren planet.  Good to watch on a rainy afternoon with family.
B005LAIIFS|3.0|The Movie was excellent, but there was no egg with it as promised. I was hoping to surprise my kids with the movie and the eggs
B0044RUSZM|4.0|Pretty decent laptop stand; its aluminum construction goes well with macbooks. It comes with two brackets and a clear plastic bar to snap the brackets on to. My only complaint is that it lacks the elegance of single piece options, however, the U shape probably helps with airflow from underneath the device since there's less contact with the surface underneath the computer. It would've been fantastic if all three pieces were pre-bolted and made of a single piece of metal.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Read the book from start to finish in one day... Just could not put it down. Great characters, great story, interesting twists!<br /><br />A great read!
B008M721MS|1.0|I don't know what's wrong with this app.  The call connects but there is no video from my Kindle fire HD.  This is a huge disappointment.  Luckily this app was free so it doesn't bother me to much to delete it.  Looked on line, seems many people have this problem and nothing is being done to fix the problem.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|It's a great game to play when trying to kill time! My husband and kids love playing the game too.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I was supposed to read this book in high school, but I never did. Reading it now--as an adult, with children of my own--truly opens my eyes to alternative ideas of my place in eternity, of religion and faith, and being a guardian.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best series ever.  Love it and look forward to the next season.  Highly recommend.  Wish there were more quality shows like this on TV.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun game but you have to scan and tap really fast. Your eyes will train to see the whole block at once. If you eyes roam it takes to much time.
0345803507|5.0|After reading the first book, I was not too sure if I wanted to read on.  So glad I did!
B00F96P8S4|5.0|Loved the CD.  Cher is outstanding! The music is fresh, moving and promotes all aspects of life.  Cher's voice is remarkable!  One of her best!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I love this show it is awesome I have been hooked ever since the first episode and cheaper than what they sell it for in stores
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|This movie is painful, funny, uplifting, and inspiring.  Great performances and a storyline and narrative that put this movie in my top ten.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Upon Opening The App, It Tells Me To Update Before I Can Play, But When I Click Download, It Just Says Open, Not Update. I Love This Game, Play It Multiple Times A Day, But Now I Can't Even Get In. I'm Sure I Am Going To Lose The Babies I Have To Hatch And Have To Spend My Acorns To Recover Them. How Convenient For The App Developers, Huh? After Reading everyone's Reviews On The Update, Though, I Am Not Sure I Want It To Update Either.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This was excellent! I really liked the story and the characters. There was a lot revealed/explained. The action was phenominal.
0307476464|5.0|Happy with my purchase, It was what I was expecting and in the condition that I was expecting. Thank you!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this and the first one. Can't wait to get the third.  Hope the movie is just as good !!!!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Use it daily, it's great!!! Only complaint is there are a couple blogs I can't find?? Other than that I really like and would definitely recommend.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun way to keep your brain active.  It's also an entertaining way to amuse when you want to do something other than read or watch a video.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|love playing this game! its fun and challenging. plus it was free! will play more games like this. thank you G5!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was as Amazing as all the others but I will still miss finnick and prim<br />Best series so far
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|John Mayer does it again. This album is amazing. I can listen to it all day long! buy it you wont regret it!
B00A11AN6O|4.0|This is the best I have found after trying different ways to take my pictures and videos with me. Now I have them handy all the time. This together with my Kindle Fire has empowered me to share smiles and good memories all over my family.
B004PVKFR8|3.0|awolnation. this cd is ok the hit song sail is on it and the other songs take a couple of time of hearing it to really like  more of a harder rock kinda sound to it
1400069807|5.0|I read this book from cover to cover.  The author is a Pulitzer Prize winner, so I assumed it was quite factual.  HIs research notes are incredible.  It's not just his opinion.  It is based on facts.  It is very readable, not so scientific a lay person can't understand it though.  Being a Baby Boomer, I particularly enjoyed the progression and changes in our diets over my lifetime.  I could see and relate to every change that took place in our food production, preparation and marketing.  Now I look at commercials completely different, read labels on everything, and have changed my diet considerably.  Everyone in this country should read this book!!
B009HNDCC4|4.0|Probably my favorite season.  Not too much focus on any one character.  Enjoyed additional family members of Gloria and Phil.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I love the folksy, kinda pop sound of the Lumineers.  Every song on this CD is wonderful!  I enjoy having all the songs, not just choosing one or two.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I can't believe this show has gone on this long. I love it! All the characters are funny! My favorite character would have to be robin.
0767811070|5.0|A five star masterpiece its touching and dramatic but a good movie overall the movie is about a boy named tre who after getting in trouble in school is sent to live with his father played by Laurence Fishburne. The next day he meets up with his friends Ricky and Doughboy who live across the street their mother treats ricky like a king and a Doughboy like a slave because the boys have two different fathers Doughboy and Chris are arrested for a stealing from a store then the movie skips ahead years later when all the boys are teenagers. Tre still lives with his father, dougboy becomes a drug dealer and Ricky is a football player in my mind the movie really jumps off when a gang member named ferris bumps into Ricky and starts a confrontation and doughboy stands up for his brother and takes out a gun. Near the end of the movie trey and ricky run into ferris and his crew and they try to get away so they decide to split up. Tre is walking and ricky is scratching a lottery ticket he bought, a red car pulls up trey turns around and screams ricky in slow motion he trys to run but he is shot once in the leg and in the abdomen he falls to the ground in a heap.Ricky is brought back to his mothers house and she is distraught and immediately blames doughboy tre goes to his house to get a gun and furious stops him and takes the gun but he leaves anyway with doughboy and his friends. The gang members are at a burger joint and monster tells doughboy to turn off the lights and they kill all 3 in succession. The next morning doughboy tells tre he doesn't have a brother or a mother and that his mom loved ricky more than she loved him he walks away and tre says you still have one brother left and he walks away and tre closes the door behind him the end credits roll with a quote increase the peace.
B009R659L8|5.0|Ordered this for my iPad Kindle app to read on the plane on our trip to Mexico!  Easy to purchase and a great read.  Mary Higgins Clark does it again keeping you in suspense.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I very much enjoyed watching this movie. It had great magic tricks and several clever little twists. I did figure out it out and was delightfully surprised. Watch this one!
B0091LS07E|5.0|I enjoyed this CD a great deal.  I don't get to hear it much, since my daughter plays the CD more that I do.
B007CMD5EC|5.0|John 5 is an Amazing Guitarist and this is a Fantastic CD!  Highlights on this CD for me are: &#34;Asland Bump&#34;, &#34;Killa Fornia&#34;, &#34;The Castle&#34;, &#34;The Lies You Live&#34; and &#34;Creepy Crawler&#34;.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I've tried alot of hidden object games but this one is the best. With the different levels and changing goals it keeps you wanting to see what's next. I can hardly put it down. Your energy increases daily and by levels you complete so you don't need to spend any money to continue play as long as don't mind wanting a little while. I only have it for stars because after I got level 28 it does keep crashing and kicking me out in the middle of a search, but I have hope that will be corrected soon.
B003VW54QO|4.0|I never get tired of watching the B-rated characters in Rio Bravo acting in a class A way.  Bet I'll watch it again soon.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|As entertaining as the first book and left me wanting to immediately start the next book in the series. I high recommend this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great visuals, story, actors, and timeline.  Such a wonderful show that gets you hooked from the very beginning! Can't wait for season four to begin.
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|The Sleepy Hollow is a good movie,for a mature audience with historical background in culture of the Colony from America. More killing,detective and jealous plots from religion,family to government involvements. A good movie,from a good novel,by a good author with historical ghost,demon and detective works. Highly recommend,a legend of headless demon from greed or revenge plot to detective or scientific work. Fun movie,for an enjoyable audience with mature mind.
B000ZJTPLG|5.0|Practice anywhere anytime. Indispensable. Plenty of headphone volume. Good volume control wheel. No problem fitting into strat jack. Has an on-off switch.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Sound and appearance not practical<br /><br />I was needing a bit more than what this provides.<br /><br />The practicality for me was just not there.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Downloaded it to play a video file on my Kindle, Was told to download another plug in in order to play it. My kindle would not allow me to download it because it wasn't compatible with it. Talk about worthless.
0553565915|5.0|Amazing...I loved it!  Very spiritual and very well described.  I think it's a great read for people who fear death.  Definitely a must read.
B00125WAWS|5.0|Great Movie! keeps you on toes, speeches are really well done and denzel gives a really good performance. If you like The Help, you'll also like this movie.
B00DK9FNLY|5.0|This game is really fun to play, is quite challenging at times, a lot more fun than I thought it would be.
0060555661|4.0|for me true insight I did not have into the stock market.  A book everyone should read before investing. Worth your money
B0047685I2|4.0|I am not much of a movie critic. I know when I like a movie, but I am not into describing that for everyone else. What I will say is that I saw this movie several years ago when it first came out. I like the genre and it's a good family fun movie. My rating reflects my opinion of the movie. I did have a problem with the Blu-ray disc. For whatever reason, it would not play in my player. I think it was a bad disc and not region issue. I ended up returning the disc and replaced it with the DVD version. It played just fine on my player.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The writing was very good and the pace of the story went quickly. The character development was excellent and really drew me in as a reader. The ending was so unexpected. I was gripping the book till the very end.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|I can listen to these songs over and over. I enjoy the clever way it is arranged. I want to hear more!
0143124544|5.0|Moyes writes deftly of 2 lives that come together as a result of big changes, and she does it without making the story mushy or sentimental. The main characters are fleshed out in all their glory and pain, and it makes them so very human. They both impact one another tremendously, and that's incredible, given that they wouldn't have ever crossed paths before their lives changed.<br />Very well written, funny at times and sad at others. This book made a cross-country plane trip whizz by.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I have not watch the original Star Trek in years.  Great to revisit the old series.  Really enjoyed the remastered look.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is a great app....I love redoing pictures making them look however I want them too and its just an awesome app.... I would definitely recommend this app to anyone and everyone
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but doable. Everything you need to solve the puzzzle. This was great fun. Looking forward to new rooms.  I highly recommend it.
B0046179EO|5.0|Plain and simple this album is fantastic. Joey Molland, Tom Evans and Mike Gibbons shine. But it is the magic of Pete Ham that really stands out. He is a MASTER songwriter with a beautiful voice. Day After Day, Baby Blue, Perfection and the hauntingly beautiful Name of the Game. Every Ham song is a ten. He is the whole package. A phenomenal guitarist, a perfect voice and arguably the greatest songwriter to put pen to paper. Let us not forget that he co-authored with Tom Evans &#34;Without You&#34;... A musical masterpiece. And he wrote these before he turned 25.
B0094K1K42|1.0|...sad movie, about dark spirited woman with no hope, shallow from being beauty queen in high school, emotionally stunted, alcoholic...forever.  And just when you think she may figure it out, she...doesn't.  The thing about this movie and how \\"everyone can relate\\" is that it is simply tragic that we think this kind of living is, on any level, okay.  And let's be honest, the way the main character is/lives, is all too familiar.  Selfish, stunted...an epidemic, and yes, I will say it, of lack of morality, lack of any sense of reality.  So, there it is.  Not at all the funny movie I was hoping for.  I get the dark, artsy, introspective goal.  Just too sad...lame, even, for me.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I'm real picky about TV programs and TGW is one of the few that I watch. They have assembled a good cast of interesting people and the story lines are most often original, they also show the side of attorneys that they would like to sweep under the rug.<br />That's about all that needs to be said, turn it on and watch it, you will more likely than not like it.<br />Reviewers that go on and on and try to write a review like Tolstoy would write it are way, way too full of themselves. A show is either good or bad, entertaining or not is all that you want to read. Bottom line----Turn it on, you'll probably like it.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|A unique view of dealing with inner conflict side-by-side with self discovery contained within the persona of a serial killer while indulging his need for fulfillment.  But what need is he truly trying to fulfill?  Within the answer to that question lies his salvation or damnation.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Aside from the TV extension factor, the potential is quite clear once apps are developed to take advantage of it. And that's the disadvantage, as of now, there are quite a limited number of apps available. Another downside is that it's not very useful outside of the US or other countries it supports. Maybe once the AirCast application launches or something like it, it could be the game changing app for Chromecast.
0714864803|4.0|This book is a really nice entry point into middle eastern food. You have to source some ingredients from a specialty market, however, that's part of the fun. The photos are good and the preparations are simple. You might actually cook a weeknight meal from this book. Would like to see more prose about the food and traditions. The photography is great. Would consider giving as a gift. Highly recommended.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Yep, five seasons in and it just gets funnier and funnier. This is an odd sitcom. The characters actually grow...Do yourself a favor and give it a shot.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|At first I wasn't sure I was going to like it, but the complexity got better and better as we get to know the characters, their motivations, their pain.  I really liked the very end where the author discusses what might have been. You just never know what the consequences will be of actions taken or not taken. One missed turn, appointment, etc. your entire life could be different. If you are a believer in fate, you will enjoy.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|That is what my daughter spends playing this. She played it for almost an entire 9 hour drive. It must be fun. Wierd to hear the screams coming from the back seat though....
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not surprisingly, is skewed toward Android users. Tabcasting, the feature I bought it for, doesn't work on iOS. Also thought I might be able to Tabcast streaming content from my PC. Nope! Creates way to much network traffic to work smoothly. Returned it and bought a Roku for $15 more to handle my streaming content. Much better solution.<br /><br />If all you do is watch YouTube videos, this is the solution for you.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|Fast delivery hubby loves it!! Great movie for those that like studying music and enjoy watching 3 master guitarists at work doing what they love
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend. I said okay, I always value a personal book recommendation. As I started reading it, I realized, &#34;what the heck? The dog is telling the story?&#34; This is not a cartoon or a talking animal thing, it is incredibly well written, uniquely assembled to tell the tale in a way I never imagined. I could not put it down. I absolutely loved this story of a man, his dog, then marriage, a daughter, love, heartbreak, race cars, devotion, passion, perseverance and commitment. Start reading it and get ready to fall in love with a wonderful story and an unforgettable way of telling it.
1933865474|5.0|the color reproduction is decent for this cheaper version.  it's definitely a great addition to the art book library and it's affordable enough to purchase a bunch as gifts.
B005LAIIGW|4.0|WOW!  Finally a Clooney movie that didn't stink! And as usual, another hit for Sandra Bullock.<br /><br />I did NOT see it in 3D, but I imagine it would be incredible to see that way -- it was pretty incredible in non-3D. Really nice visuals!<br /><br />I have to say I was on the edge of my seat (figuratively speaking) throughout this movie, and practically holding my breath the whole time.  Space is a very scary place! One thing though, I have to admit I was getting a little nauseous because of all the spinning around they do (so if you get that way on amusement rides easily, you might want to wait until AFTER the movie to eat!)<br /><br />It must've been done largely with green screen because while I was riveted I was at the same time wondering how the heck they could've filmed this.<br /><br />My husband only gives it a \\"C\\" grade because he thought it was \\"predictable\\". Maybe it was, but I confess to being surprised at least once or twice.
B005PMN83Y|4.0|Like every Insomnium album, this delivers with great songwriting and musicianship, while failing in post production. These guys should find a new studio.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I got this game mainly because it was the free app of the day. I didn't expect it to be so fun &amp; addictive.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|Like all Amon Amarth albums between the year 2000 and now, this album is fantastic. It's very polished and pretty much exactly what one would expect from them, which is pure awesomeness.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a great read. Really makes you think  about all the different choices there are in life and how even the small choices can make a major impact in your life. One of the best books I have read this year.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|My 6 year old daughter loves this movie.  She and her friends can't get enough of it!!  The songs are very catchy as are the dances.  Very well done Disney movie suitable for all ages.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|SWEET. !!!!!  ;)<br />  I love this game.  it's. great fun for the whole family.  SWEET.!!!!!!!!!!  :) ;) great. job. should have more acorns to be gotten .....
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|I just can't go any where with it. I got the three stars in the first game ,but I can't open the next character to keep playing. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Is there a secret to it . If so Let me know. Thank you.
1455526959|5.0|Any one who has read the Harry Bosch series will love this new book. A must read. Best to read from the first
B00D7OMNXS|3.0|it was just ok not better than the other two movies. 1 and 2 were much better this was vert slow
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This was awesome! The price was great and my husband and I had been wanting to add to out Supernatural Collection. Delivery time was really quick.
B00ECL7ZJ2|4.0|After first seeing Haim's single Don't Save Me on Epic Videos on the Palladia channel, I thought I'd buy the album.  Their sound is simple yet fun.  The vocals and electric beats sound 80s and their guitar riffs are basic yet reminiscent of 70s rock.  Their sound is not complex and does lack depth, but I still found it enjoyable.  The Wire and Forever are catchy singles and I find myself singing it over and over again.  These sisters definitely rock and are worth a try.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game keeps you thinking. It is easy to learn the steps to play it. Some of the puzzles are a bit difficult but hints help out when needed. Wish there were more puzzles.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love how they have brought together the rural (hamlet) and the progressing urban settings. I'm intrigued by the lives of Dorcas, the Timmins, The Pratt sisters, Queenie and everyone around them. I wish they had not stopped after 4 seasons.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I had a little bit of a hard time setting it up (I wouldn't talk with my router during setup.)  But after fixing the setup issue, the device has been awesome!  I mostly use Chrome on a PC to cast from and it works beautifully!!!
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|The show is great, but the audio through steaming was terrible! The audio kept dropping out so it was had to follow the story.
B008JEJO88|5.0|First of all I never thought I would wear crocs.  When they first arrived on the scene they looked hideous and I never even considered purchasing them for myself.  Fast forward 10 years and I was forced to borrow a pair when my normal shoes were destroyed, and glad I did!  The comfort is unparalleled.  Swallow the pride and get a pair!<br /><br />The only complaint is that they did not come in half sizes, so if you are a half size I would recommend going one size smaller; you dont want these clogs loose on your feet.
B000FC130E|4.0|This book kept me intrigued.  Very interesting and entertaining. I would recommend it to any one who enjoys a good story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the game....great skills and different things to do..really like how u can advance or even push onto even after you die...
B004ZH66XO|4.0|This is a fun game. It plays well on Kindle fire. I could play it for hours, it's rather addicting.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|The product came quickly and in wonderful new condition.  It turned out to be a great gift for my girlfriend who loves Fleetwood Mac, but who doesn't have any of their CD's.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Some books are entertaining but not brilliant; some books are brilliant but not entertaining. A Visit from the Goon Squad is that rare book that manages to be both and does it, well...brilliantly.<br /><br />The goon of the title is time, a word used by one of the characters who asserts that time, that goon, cannot hold them hostage but, of course, it does. The book is broken into chapters, each about a different character, often referring to someone who has  been mentioned only in passing in the previous chapters. Each chapter has its own voice, sometimes in the first person sometimes in the third, and in one chapter about a tragic young man, spoken to an unseen other he calls 'you'.<br /><br />The book moves back and forth through time as the characters bump into one another like atoms attracting and repelling each other. Language and lifestyles change as time changes. One chapter is done in power point as it discusses the pauses of music as defined by an autistic young boy who listens fro the length of pauses in songs and defines the value of these songs by the length of these pauses. In the last chapter, some time in a somewhat dystopian American future, Egan imagines a world where people communicate in the language of tweets.<br /><br />\\"no 1 n0s abt me. Im invysbl\\"<br /><br />This book is at times humourous and at others  sad but it is always engaging.  Ultimately, it is about the interconnectedness between us and the people we bump into throughout our lives and how they define who we are and what we become.
1465012796|5.0|Was on time and the product was exactly as described on the website. This was purchased for far less than at a retail store.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins is a fascinating author. I love his use of the English language and his alternating passages of  the different plot lines, which used to be preceded by &#34;meanwhile.&#34; It has you in suspense about the various main characters all at the same time. Each book in the 9 volume series a is a stand-alone novel , but in reading them from volumes 1-9 you know the story in full behind each reference. Yes, there is much blood and gore, but enhances the peril of the main characters., and a lot of peril there is. On top of that is the surprise of who the moles are - usually a surprise.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I'm so gl ad we got a good app of day, its been a few days since we got something worth it.<br /><br />great game
B003U4UPTE|5.0|A fantastic 2nd season! Still as mysterious and suspenseful as season 1. I hope this series never ends. I'm hooked.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really nifty spin. I love the box and pipe puzzles. It is more than just hidden object finds and has different helpers aside from just your basic &quot;here it is&quot;
B00821OX98|5.0|It was very good. A great story line and really good acting.  I can say no more. really Ya'll, Really
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|awesome movie. very child friendly without being too immature. I am 25 now and enjoy it as much as I did when i was younger.
1408215330|4.0|I have been working with English Language Adult Learners.  This is the dictionary recommended by the head of our program.  It has simple meanings that are easy to understand.  I would recommend it.
B00D3ZJB1S|3.0|Ozz sounds good, but, the band needs a lot of work. Ozz sounds so much better when he is in front of Black Lable.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I am a huge fan and this book delivered a predictible novel.  Mr Sparks has a formula and this one followed it true to form.
B001GUXJQA|3.0|The story moves slowly and I found myself putting the book down and say, dusting the furniture, for instance. Hard to keep the dead cops straight and wondering at the Bosch's superiors, including the Asst. Police Chief's, going along with his telling them what he will and won't do - like conduct an investigation in Mexico against the king pin drug lord who's making and distributing black ice, the latest drug craze in the states.<br /><br />Love Trunk Music and Angel Flight, etc. but every author hits a bump even the wonderful Connelly.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|my daughter love it! I gave her as an reward, one page each time she did good things. Wish the price can be a bit cheaper.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I have not successfully gotten mine to work yet, had to research some trouble shooting tips and I am going to try again after I figure out how to change my router settings.<br />If this really is the issue, then I think they need to fix it, my phone and other devices connect to my Wifi very easily, why is it that I have to change something on my router?<br /><br />In addition to that, issue, you need to be aware that this thing needs power. The HDMI Plug in is at one end, and There is a USB plug in at the other end, it comes with a Power adapter too so you can plug into the wall, however, you will need to make sure this thing reaches the outlet. By the time you add everyting else, this thing isn't much smaller than a Ruku box. Since it does have a USB, then why not have the option to plug it in to a PC and set it up that way?<br /><br />Each time you take it to a new Wifi spot, you will have to set it up again, and I read that you will not be able to set it up at hotels and on public wifi.<br /><br />If it does eventually work and work well, then I will be pretty happy with it, but so far, it's not looking very good.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|Haim took me a while to get into after hearing a few singles here and there. However, their debut album has now made me a huge fan. Days Are Gone is very catchy and the lyrics are fun.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|Camera is upside down and can't fix LAME AND ANNOYING UNINSTALL WAST  OF TIME<br />BAD APP FOR THIS ANNOYANCE<br />DO NOT INSTALL FOR KINDLE FIRE HD
0142501123|5.0|Perfectly written with Halloween flair and a ton of friendship! Friends pull together when times get rough. Even Witches find the time to lend a hand for friendship building! This book has impressed me to the core with originality, artwork, great values and FUN!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed the book; I found it hard to put down. However, I was a bit disappointed by the ending; it was anti-climatic. It was a little 'too pat' and not really fitting emotionally or realistically.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome, awesome product that was well worth the wait.  For $35, this thing works seamlessly with my iPad, iPod touch, MacBook, and Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Most Amazing Book That Ive Ever Read. The Author Is Truely Amazing WIth All The Details And Different Direction The Story Kept Turning! Im In Aww & Cant Say Enough How Amazing She Wrote This Story!
B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|I really like some of this author's books (Mistborn was great, and I like the Stormlight series), and others are just barely entertaining enough to get through.  This falls in the latter category.  The premise seemed really cool(normal people trying to assasinate superhumans) but the writing was just not great. There were a logical leaps by characters that came from nowhere.  The whole thing felt very forced, and I found a couple of plot holes that just bugged me.  Not going to be reading the next chapter of this series.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very Helpful. I learned some things about myself as well as some things to apply to my relationships. I am considering other books in the series
B003NVMWBS|2.0|Love the movie but absolutely terrible quality!!! It was blurry for 95% of the movie and hurt my eyes. If you want a copy, I recommend splurging for the HD version, (hopefully better), or just buying the DVD.
1582701709|5.0|I love the secret. It has helped me tremendously nad has transformed my life. I am now more happier and care free because of my ability to gravitate to the positive which I learned through the teachings of The Secret.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|If you find the show entertaining, but find yourself unable to completely suspend your disbelief of the story line that's because Piper Kerman's narrative is not a sensationalized account of same-sex love affairs or forbidden liaisons between guards and female inmates laced with gallows humor.  Rather, it is a thought provoking reflection of the effects incarceration has on a prisoner's mind, spirit, and body. Ms. Kerman, the author, is immensely more down-to-earth and sympathetic than the fictionalized Piper Chapman. She describes the women she meets &#34;on the inside&#34; with searing honesty, yet manages to make sure that the inherent worth of each human being comes through. Particularly interesting was Ms. Chapman's description of the different lock-up facilities and the inmate transport system &#34;Con Air.&#34; Throughout this memoir, Ms. Kerman connects with the reader in a way that one absolutely gets the sense that this experience could happen to anyone and that each of us should take care to be conscious of our modus operandi and efforts to be law abiding citizens.  Ms. Kerman took a clearly horrible chapter in her life and shared it with the world to provide insight into how prisons are run and prisoners are treated and to offer some insight on what reform could look like for women in  minimum security lock-up. Piper Kerman has a formidable voice and I really hope that she writes another book!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Show is great.  Riveting!  Can't wait to watch all the episodes.  maybe next season we'll see it in real time.  Ha Ha
B004TN7QPG|1.0|I choose this rating because it was not compatible with my kindle fire 2 ( what is up with that?). Very disappointed.<br />I will say that amazon worked with me to refund my money
B0089XH38M|5.0|I can see why AVG is liked by so many professional computer gurus.  Thank you, AVG for not charging for your great product. I can assure you that this software is free--unlike so many, other products that say they are free!
1781162646|5.0|To be clear I have never sampled anything from the Hard Case Crime library but I am a Constant Reader from waaaaaay back so pre-ordering this was easy for me.<br /><br />If nothing else King can tell an incredible and captivating story. This was less of a traditional book and more coming of age story with little bits of standard supernatural. I was sucked in right away and aside from wanting to grab Devin and shake that whole sad puppy dog attitude right out of him I found myself genuinely feeling bad for him.<br /><br />The carny atmosphere was great and the lingo, while a complete fallacy I am sure, was a good immersion into a different world. I defy you not to laugh as Devin gets into the dog costume and does the hokey pokey. Even his summer friends I really liked from the first moment and was sad at the inevitable separation that comes with the end of the summer. The only things I wished for was about 300 more pages to expand on the haunted amusement park theme and to give more background to Annie and Mike as they seemed a little flat.<br /><br />Overall this is Stephen King doing what he does best, plucking your emotions like a master and dragging you through a story that is hard to put down.  You should not go into this expecting a traditional crime story or even a typical Stephen King supernatural novel.  This is a short and sweet book that is just an exceptional story on its own.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|So far this is my favorite version of Jane Eyre!!! I love Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester and Mia Wasikowska did an amazing job.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game it is fun game that's takes my mind of the days business. I wake to this game and go to sleep to it also. Love love live
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie exemplifies the true American success story which is the foundation of our country. While the character struggles are heart wrenching, the culmination of the story is worth the agony!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought it was a great read! Well written and I felt as if I was there with the characters throughout the book. Currently reading part two and it's just as good.
B002WCLG48|4.0|I have been a fan of the Halo franchise since getting the original Xbox for Christmas 2001. For me, the games weren't enough. I have read most of the novels and the comics and loved the Forward Unto Dawn web series. The 8 stories on this DVD tell different stories set in the Halo universe from numerous times and places. Only one of the stories directly features The Master Chief, but that's fine. Seeing a mixture of anime styles mashing with Halo was a blast.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|It is a good movie and the full screen version  fills up the complete screen of my TV.  It is full of action and suspense and is able to be viewed by all members of your family (with some parental common sense such as Dracula and Frankestein are not real).  The violence that this type of movie displays is &#34;tame&#34; compared to what is seen on the TV on any night.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|They have continued to make a quality show,  engaging characters,  never a dull moment.  they know how to pull at the heartstrings.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|It is a real mgood movie, inspite of what the critics say.  It was one of Disney's most expensive movies and has been &#34;knocked&#34; by a lot of people.  It is a good Sci-Fi movie with lots of action in it that the whole family can watch.  The full screen version takes up the whole screen of my older TV.  I loved it and thoroughly recommend it to everyone.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas movies ever!! You will laugh the whole way through at the antics of Clark and his family.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|the app seems to be unable to recognize my account after multiple efforts, even entering the correct information.  The app seems to be designed for mobile phones over the kindle fire that I am using.
B00821OX98|5.0|Nice to have something cleaver on tv that is good these days that isn't filled with profanity and sex.  Good family series.
B00C5R8364|5.0|It was good to read the master story teller that Fredrick Forsyth is. The Tracker, his protagonist, is certainly worthy of more stories in a series.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Not sure why I wasn't watching before. I'm hooked now. Watched season 1 non stop. Love me some Charlie Hunnam
B004HD61KE|5.0|The story was super, I enjoyed reading the amazing fun filled story. Good thing the story was not true, that would really be terrible.
B00A2H9P98|1.0|Comparing this movie to Olympus Has Fallen is like trying to compare Michael Jordan to Greg Ostertag. Olympus was great. White house (way)<br />down was the total opposite of great.  Jay
B00701L5XS|4.0|This is a fantastic guide to a wide variety of knots with very simple how to animations. I love it.
0307950689|5.0|this book was a page turner. Dan Brown keeps you reading well into the night. Love all the historical interest in the book. you learn while your entertained. highly recommend
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I liked how the kids found each other after both having tragedy in their lives. There are 2 more books in the series that continues their story.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|I like that the series is streaming for Prime members.  Like the convenience of being able to watch it almost anywhere.
B00FEJHPRI|5.0|Outstanding effects.<br />Good story<br />very entertaining!!!!!<br />It.s about time pepper got in on the action she makes a beautiful &#34;Super Hero&#34;!!
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|Greatly entertaining for me!  Jaden and Will both had excellent performances, kept me on the edge of my seat.  I recommend you watch it and enjoy the ride!  Jaden is turning into a wonderful actor. Action, Sci Fi, Loads of beautiful scenery shots.
6305428042|5.0|I grew up watching this, and when I saw it on sale, I knew I had to buy it. So funny and endearing. Also, living in Salem, it's fun to play &#34;Guess that place&#34;
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|It feels like someone else wrote the book, everything is so out of place. The characters behave weird. I wonder if Charlaine Harris died and the publisher plotted to cover her death so they can keep publishing books that someone else is writing...<br />I'm just disappointed.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I don't take time out to write a lot of reviews, but this time I think I will. Amazon has been getting us some pretty good apps lately. And this one is no exception. Granny Smith is actually featured on the Tegra Zone. Which as most of you already know if you have a tegra processor like I do, then you always keep an eye on the Tegra zone. the game itself is a runner, with a little bit of attitude. The graphics are absolutely phenomenal, way better on my Tegra tablet, then on any Kindle HD. Sorry Kindle HD users, but this app was made for my processor. Is not a lot bad to be said about this game, except for the difficulty does get rather tedious rather fast. Anybody with a nice phone and/or tablet should love this app. And one last time I just wanted to say thank you to Amazon, you're free app of the day choice is have been getting much better lately.  I think it is in part to the release of the next Kindle tablet. Which is finally supposed to be on par with the Tegra processor set. I myself do not own a Kindle,because of its extreme limitations on the Android software. However this new one looks pretty promising, with full Google Play access, I might be looking into one of these. Especially if Amazon keep the awesome software Rolling :-)  ML.......
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game some of them are hard but most of them are easy in my opinon and i think that the plane game is stupid that why on the setting it says don't allow plane game and i pressed it
B008JFLWLE|5.0|this app is really cool because i can write out my problems instead of typing them! so neat! you should get it!
B009C7JS14|4.0|It's a great app. I would of given it 5 stars if it would of shoes a the  percentage of the rainfall. But anyway is good app<br />Just tap on the app, it shows you the whole weather forecast!
B00E4W40C4|5.0|The problems with most X-men movies tend to be having too many mutants and cheesy dialogue. This movie only has 3 mutants in it. There aren't any bad lines of dialogue either. The problem with the Wolverine character is that he is invincible.  For once, Wolverine is not invincible here.<br /><br />A lot of people complain about the last battle scene. I didn't have any problems with it as Wolverine is easily outmatched for once.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This app is awesome,  funny, addictive, and you always want to try to beat your high score, so it keeps you entertained for hours at a time, there is nothing to lose because it is FREE, there is a lot of characters to unlock and SO MANY DUMB WAYS TO DIE
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|The first episode was ok.<br />The second episode was good.<br />The third? Great!<br />By the fourth, I was hooked! And Tatiana Maslany is fantastic!  Can't wait for next season!
B003PGNBO8|5.0|The show died before its time. The grand conspiracy remained intact. The creators definitely thought it was going to be renewed. I wanted to see the last 7 episodes. Well paced who done it?
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I suppose it works OK as YouTube and Netflix video player, apart from that it really doesn't do anything. There are no other apps  for this device.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game. It's very addicting. Love this game. Reminds me of the  quarter game at the fair.
0375869026|5.0|This is a great children's book. My sixth grader uses it in his language arts class and he liked the book.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|Opening number skips. Not sure of the test of the cd as I only listened to the first three cuts.
B00FMPCMRM|5.0|WOW! The premiere was amazing, flawless, and so many other words I do not have room to put here!!! I was also ecstatic when they played the song Royals, by Lorde! My favorite song in my favorite show during the premiere!!! This is going to be an amazing season, better than last years! Thank you so much CW for an amazing show! This is the first time I have ever watched a show that was better than the books! I have read every book by LJ Smith that has to do with the Vampire Diaries, and tbh, some of the reads are rather disappointing. The show however, has not let me down! I really love the new \\"caring\\" Damon.( Just hope he doesnt get too caring, lol)! I am also relieved that Jeremy is back, because really I think he is actually my favorite character! It's really hard to say who my favorite would be though. I tend to pick favorites that arent the obvious choice. I think Jeremy has really grown up and has come a long way in his acting since the first season. I cant wait to see the next episode!
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|&#34;This was an open box ... But it was perfect , and I saved $10.00 .. Perfect addition to my Breaking Bad collection - Say My Name - Heisenberg ! Cheers &#34;
B00DCRE83S|5.0|Nice to hear something a little different, you can hear a lot Jason's influences. I hear a little Testiment sound in vocals, a bit of classic MotorHead and of course some Metallica.  Great tempo swings, good productions and the lyrics are pretty cool also.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This was an unusual off beat movie , but me and my other half really liked it . Well worth the rental fee IMO !
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I thought this book was good.  However, I enjoyed his other books more than this one.  A good read however.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Best show on TV bar none ... This was a gift for my brother and it arrived in perfect shape . He recently watched the first 2 seasons and was hooked . He was happy to continue catching up with season 3 !
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I had a little trouble in the beginning understanding what the author was writing about.  After the first couple of chapters it became clear to me, and I enjoyed this book.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|I have enjoyed this book since the second I downloaded it. It is worth the 7 dollars I spent to get it. It definitely adds more detail to the storyline letting you experience what it was like to train and genetically enhance the Spartans. I loved this book and can't wait for the next book.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|why wood you get this game? it is a super bad game. I just watched the video and i knoow it was a super bad game. so do not get this game.I wish I cood give it 0 stars. I hope all of you geys that say it is a good game get convicted of sins. aman. AND GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU!!!!!
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|It's Rod Stewart ....what's not to love! It is a little different with it being his early years, Maggie May doesn't have the same words. But if you love Rod Stewart it doesn't matter.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|In this story,two wrongs do make it right when dealing with our legal system. The book was not realistic compared to his other books. It was still a great read.
B000005B0U|1.0|Watching the movie and listening to the music there was much better. Just listening to the CD not to impressed. I wouldn't recommend.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My favorite book of the series!! Loved every minute of this read. Highly recommend these. You'll be up for hours!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Although some of the situations are a bit far fetched and the characters sometimes tend to be caricatures, the smart dialogue more than makes up for any of the shortcomings in this series.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love Castle and this season is no exception. It has interesting plots and great writing. This season makes me eager for Season 6.
141659521X|4.0|Bought this for my significant other he said it was really good. Vince Flynn is one of his favorite authors. Will by another one when it comes out. Received it on time.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I was tired of sending photos my email.  This made it super easy to have them upload directly to amazon.  Now I can share them much better.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|This album just makes me feel good. After a long day. Put your worries aside and listen to this. It makes me smile.
1885167776|5.0|\\"The ONE Thing\\" is a must read for anyone who has ever set goals only to watch another year pass by without reaching those goals... Whether you want to succeed at business or at life, this book provides simple and practical advice that anyone, at any stage of life or career, can incorporate into daily life.<br /><br />Perhaps like me, you have it in your mind that you have already heard it all and tried it all...and none of it really works over the long haul. \\"The ONE Thing\\" is different.  A relatively short and a very easy (even fun) read, it had me saying over and over again, \\"This is so simple and makes so much sense! I wish I had known this sooner!\\"
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Great movie, but scarier than I anticipated. It is a great rental, but I would not purchase it unless I loved zombie movies.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Intelligent dialogue, stunning costumes and scenery, riveting story. I started watching to see the costumes and was drawn into the manor house and it's inhabitants. Can't wait for Season 4!!
B003Z49LYO|3.0|It is depressing. A very sad story.  Don't watch this thinking it is a Jane Austen story with happy endings.  The show was done very well; is well-acted; and has beautiful scenery.  It also stayed true to the novel.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|You spend slot of money with no results. People e enjoy results. I don't know anyone that spends money to get nothing in return.
B00B2QA9TI|1.0|OMG! I HATE THIS MOVIE. I loved the novel - a classic. But this movie style - I don't know what you call it - makes the whole thing comic-bookish. It is not clever. It is annoying. Boo and hiss!
0761174192|5.0|I've been buying this calendar since 2012. I got my first cat calendar in 2011 as a gift. Too adorable.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Not one of John Grisham's best novels, but good enough to finish. I was not sitting on the edge of my seat, but a pleasant read anyway.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|My 7 year old enjoyed it for about 5 - 10 minutes, then it was uninstalled. Not much too it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game for the price.. I play it in my free time. Never gets old. It has three different game settings.
B00AM7E4LM|5.0|I think the book is really good. There's no secret to learning new skills efficiently and Josh is very aware of that. He has a bunch of common sense tips that put together make up a great learning method and he shares his own experience in a way that will definitely motivate you to stop procrastinating. I hate self-help books and I'm glad to say that this is not one of them. This is not about the secret to happiness or the meaning of life and the book does not treat the reader as if he or she were stupid or desperate. Josh is simply sharing an obvious but powerful idea: that if you approach learning from a strategic perspective you can be far more efficient than if you just jump into the water and learn to swim the hard way. It's worth mentioning that I happened to be a Go player (3d) and also someone who touch-types in a different keyboard layout. There's a chapter in the book devoted to how Josh learned each of these skills and I can vouch for the content about that.<br /><br />On a side note: I set up a new wiki so that we can collectively make the research part of the learning process easier by listing the set of sub-skills that are needed to learn something new: skilldeconstruction.wikia.com. Check it out and please contribute.
B0018LX9T4|4.0|Was not what I expected. Very naughty, good entertainment for adults. Would definitely watch again. All around a very good deal.
B0079XPUOW|1.0|Steer clear of this boringly unfunny book. I liked Old Mans War and even read the sequels (though they got worse as it went along), but this thing was just dull.<br /><br />From the front cover alone, WE all get what the gimmick is- it's redshirts, it's meta, ok. But it takes the 'characters' until a third through to get there- so we're just waiting, waiting...<br /><br />And 'characters', what are these people? I am tired of the breezy Scalzi style. When these people talk to each other it is entirely to exposit, or to make crass jokes the like of which kids may think adults make. They do not. The character scenes are exactly the same as the character scenes in Old Mans War.<br /><br />Enough.<br /><br />Slow, pointless, boring, and not even remotely funny. How on earth did this win any awards?
B00EHMG358|5.0|This is typical Preston and Child...they have a knack of pulling you in, right from the beginning. and after a short while you are hooked. Even though Aloysius hasn't started his sleuthing in these first nine chapters we know he's on the way. Can't wait to read the rest of the book, I've already preordered it!
B008Y212PI|5.0|this game is addicting! the pictures are interesting as well. the puzzle you draw doesn't always make sense with the picture that is revealed but I don't care because it is the puzzle that matters to me.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a fun easy game, great for a guick game without the worries of continued play.<br />GOOD: easy to play.<br />BAD: a lot of the levels are basically the same, aerial control not consistant<br />CHANGES: add a roll cage to the equipment list! ;)
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app. You can get all kinds of radio stations on it. Clearly received. The only problem is that sometimes the app will close suddenly.
B0007LGCB8|5.0|Not stylish, but I don't care, these shoes just hug my feet and I love them.  Have tried Simms shoes of similar design, also an excellent design, as is all their stuff, but I prefer the Keens.
B00F9040HU|5.0|I love the game but you said it was free. Played a few hands and then you have to buy it. I don't like being made a fool of. Please when you says it free  let it me free. I will not be pressure d into buying a game.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|This movie is full of action. The ending was a bit of a let down. The book would probably have been better.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I loved the book...just not so much the movie. I bought the movie though, because, I like the theme and story. That is pretty much it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I didn't like this app for my kindle fire at all. It would only play a selection of videos. And it was hard searching for videos. I would not recommend it at all.
B003NTSBUG|4.0|This movie totally screws with your mind and is a great drama. Leonardo DiCaprio is probably one of my favorite actors and all of the movies he is in has this sort of dark feeling to them...this movie is no different. Definitely a different movie though. If you have liked all of the other movies that he has been in, you will like this one.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I loved this game. It has lots of different levels so the adventure never ends. I play it all the time. Some of them are quite hard but it's a lot of fun.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|&#34;Pretty Cool Movie&#34; is a pretty lame review title...but that's pretty much what this movie is. It is a pretty cool plot and a nice action-packed drama. Definitely an unexplored (recently anyway) theme in movies.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I liked this weather app for my kindle fire. The radar was what I was looking for mostly and it was ok but could have been more specific.
B006PERRMY|4.0|I totally forgot about this movie. Yes I know, it probably isn't the greatest movie ever...but I really enjoy the plot and the overall story line in general. If you are the type of person who likes &#34;futuristic-actiony-dramas&#34; then you 'might' like this movie.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I didn't like this app at all. I got this for my kindle fire and it was easily accessed but the radar wasn't very good. It gave you an average range not specific enough for me.
B005FITIDC|5.0|Gerard Butler gives another great performance in a true story based movie. you can see he was passionate about his role portraying the man who actually lived this life and went to all these extreme measures to help the children!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I liked this game for my kindle fire. I played it several times but it wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. I would recommend it for younger kids.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|It has drama, suspense ,action and comedy.....and gerard butler in it! all the cast did a superb job!  loved the comedy scenes and dance scenes too.
B008Y212PI|5.0|love this game--fun puzzles and beautiful pictures make this game rock!  played from start to finish and could not put it down!
B0007TKNII|5.0|great movie , highly recommend .....the entire cast did a great job.... And the singing was awesome!  Gerard and Emma  gave a great performance and showed there many talents.
B00F5F0208|5.0|This is my favorite Drake CD! This is a masterpiece to be cherished for years to come! Drake is very transparent with his flow! I must say I love it from start to finish!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game for free! good for plane rides or long car trips. safe for kids to play! it did not work we'll on my htc phone. works great on my fire
B002EMESSM|5.0|The first time I watched this I thought it was long, overextended, and boring.  But each time I watch it again, even the extended edition (this is not), becomes more of a work of art and less than a &#34;movie.&#34; That there is no CG here is even more amazing. It just leaves me wanting more. The vision of hope and wisdom in this story, particularly in light of the recent Voyager 1 entering interstellar space, is just splendid.
