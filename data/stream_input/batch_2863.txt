030758836X|5.0|Wonderfully written.  Makes you stop and think, and then......  I really enjoyed this book.  Just ordered her other two novels.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|i had my doubts about this game but none of them came through. I recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzles.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked this book and now know what all of the hype was about. I look forward to the next one in the series.
B00CATSONE|2.0|Half of it, interesting. The 2nd half,too technical for my taste. But hey, it was free!, and not very long.
B003L77GH4|5.0|i love this show i had to buy all the seasons the product was new and the disk were perfect i would totally recommend
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|This movie was so dark in appearance, I could not see what was going on through half of the movie! I am not sure if this was because I viewed on my Kindle or if this is how it was in the movie theaters, as well. There was not enough background on who each Avenger is and how they became who they were. Very disappointing. Guess I will stick to just reading the comics
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|I forgot my wifi password so I when on to this app and I tried the password provided and it didn't work so I looked under the router and got the right password
B008XKSW7M|4.0|First off everyone needs to know that this is not anything like the book with the same title. The best scenes were with the dad's in the movie ex. Chris Rock. I liked how they also showed the experience of expecting a child and the emotions you go through the adoption process with Jennifer Lopez's story line.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I have no doubt many women and mothers will identify with Alicia, the main character.<br />She is facing dilemmas that touch many, and this is the reason the Good Wife is so addictive .<br /><br />The only reason why I did not give it a 5-star rating is that I had the first season to compare, and I enjoyed the first season better. But I totally recommend it. Go Alicia!
0399255370|5.0|I love this book so much I've bought extra copies to give away. It's clever and fun and the illustrations are priceless. I plan on using it in my fifth grade classroom to teach point of view.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|this was a good movie, nothing very interesting in the box, just the movie, but it was a good quality.
B002LVVCQM|4.0|As a lifelong atheist I heartily endorse any clear arguments in support of humanism. This treatise amply exposes Mr Dawkins frustrations with those who insist on accepting reaveled truths.There is a bit too much grousing which is hard to overlook.The battle is real and important,and the author is a much more acceptable champion than, say, Ms O`Hara from my childhood,but in this book he seems to give up the high ground too often.
B002ZHKZEC|2.0|Disc 1 Special Features \\"Doctor Who at the Proms\\" track is only the audio; the video portion is blacked out.  If you want this collection in order to have this special feature, you will be disappointed.  Also Disc 4 is missing the video portion of the Tennent Video Diary and the Christmas Idents--audio only.  I will return this album.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I have used this app for about a year now. I added cameras recently so I purchased the full version. This is so much better than the app that comes with my NVR, that one is weak. Don't bother looking anywhere else for a camera app. This is the best.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is The Best Game Ever !!! I Play It 24/7 But If There Was Other Hint Tacticts ... That Would Be Great
B0044C5SCU|5.0|A friend recommended this show & I love it. Most excellent! I am only sorry that it I'd no longer in production! A must see for sci-fi/adventure lovers!
B002KGEORM|5.0|I watched each season recently and am in love with the show and especially the characters.  The writer has done an excellent job of weaving the plot together and I am so looking forward to this season.  I am crossing my fingers that it won't end after season 7.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|does everything i wanted it too. i use it almost everyday as an alarm. would recommend to anyone looking for one.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I honestly have a hard time putting words to how wonderful this app is. I am a snoozer and in the past have been known to shut my alarm off when I snooze. Not anymore this app has a setting that you have to actually shake the object (Kindle in my case) for 30 seconds before it will allow you to shut it off :o) by that time I am awake.. Love It!
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|I just love Barbra Streisand. When you first see this movie it sucks.. But if you watch it again you realize how good it is. Plus is has major star headliners in it!!!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Being the third book in the series can be tough. While There were parts of the plot that were to be expected there was lots of twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. a great read I didn't want to put down
B00B1D7ANK|4.0|This is a beautiful action figure that belongs in a display case instead of a playful, i.e. destructive, 4-year old.
B0026772N8|5.0|this review is not going to be very helpful<br />it's another book i've finally switched over to e-book<br />i'm re-reading it
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun but needs a faster way to earn gems instead of having to purchase them.  Speed up time by changing the date on your device back and forth.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This is definitely not a comic for the little ones.  At first, the goof ball hyper red of the fake blood made me roll my eyes in an &#34;OMG, another grade C movie that I won't get through&#34; kind of way, but after a few more minutes, I had to laugh - kinda' like when you see Kill Bill the first time.  Purposefully over the top.  Over saturated colors and slo-mo abound!  Major gore in this flick, and slow motion gore nonetheless.  Any-who, predictable, but fun.  A good flic to work out to on the treadmill or elliptical, whatever - and kill time...kind of like that &#34;slo-mo&#34; drug in the movie, 'cept in reverse ;-]
140006922X|5.0|Thank you, Fox News.  I would have never purchased this book if it weren't for the ham-fisted and downright insulting \\"interview\\" conducted by Lauren Green and her producers over at Fox.  It was breath-takingly biased against a (very scholarly) man, who has studied the subject matter for two decades, and just happens to be a Muslim.  This is not a book about the Jesus of the faith world, whose deeds are largely fictionalized by his followers and written well after the man's death.  This is the historic Jesus.  A man who wanted to throw off the oppressive yoke of Roman rule and their corrupt co-conspirators at the Temple in Jerusalem.  Aslan discusses the other failed messiahs the came before and after Jesus, some of which were unknown to me.  Also described in the book are the details of Jesus's life in Nazareth prior to his mission, all of this is meticulously researched and analyzed by the scholar Aslan.  The author also goes into great detail about the political conditions surrounding first century Palestine and takes us up to the time of the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple (70 c.e.) and the early Church schism between followers of James the Just and Paul.  I would recommend this book to anyone, however people of faith may be put off by Aslan's assertions in contradiction to their sacred scriptures.  The important thing to remember is that this is a work of history, not of faith.  All of the \\"one star\\" reviews you see here are from the American Religious Right and will flat denigrate out any author who calls their faith into question (see the Fox News \\"interview\\").  In short, this is a brilliant book, extremely well-researched, entertainingly and engagingly written, and a must-read for anyone interested in learning more about the political and religious turmoil surrounding first century Palestine and the early Christian Church.
B00886XQO0|5.0|This was my first headset purchase after using a blueant bluetooth headset for chatting on my PS3 for years.<br /><br />I purchased  this headset due to the great reviews and the fact that most reviews stated that it not only sounded great but also was the most comfortable headset they've ever used.<br /><br />My other option was the Astro A50s but these had much better reviews, looked nicer and didn't have the battery issues I'd heard about that plagued many of the Astro headsets.<br /><br />The sound quality and different modes of hearing are great on this headset.  I typically use superhuman hearing or footstep focus mode which accentuates the quieter noises like someone walking up behind you, reloading their weapon within a certain proximity to your position, pulling the pin/activating a grenade or tripping a bouncing betty.  Even on the regular normal mode the sound is great and despite having only the 2 speakers, you do get a sense of surround sound so you can tell when something is going on in front or behind you.<br /><br />Another reason for purchasing this headset was to keep the house quieter while I was gaming.  Prior to purchasing this headset, I was running a 5.1 surround sound system with subwoofer so my basement sounded like a warzone whenever I was online.  Now, my wife and child aren't bothered by the noise and can sleep in peace while I'm playing a few rounds before heading to bed.<br /><br />The bluetooth on this headset works very well and is crystal clear with zero static despite multiple wireless signals present in my house that could theoretically cause interference.<br /><br />I did receive a lemon headset initially from Amazon as there was constant static in the one ear whenever the bluetooth was engaged.  A quick email to Turtle Beach had me send this headset in and a brand new headset shipped back to me although I was displeased that I had to pay the shipping charges to their facility in Ontario, Canada seeing as this was a brand new headset not working straight out of the box.  This was in no way Amazon's fault so I choose for this to not affect the rating I gave this product despite the fact that I was dissapointed I received a bogus headset and had to wait several weeks for a replacement to arrive.  Turtle beach's customer support was very good but I felt they should have had to pay for the shipping as most other reputable companies would have done so for a dud item right out of the box.<br /><br />Battery life seems pretty good.  I typically have the headset charging while watching movies on the PS3 and can then game for 6-8 hours prior to needing a charge.<br /><br />Comfort is great,  The headset has multiple adjustments to fit pretty much any size or shape of head and the earmuffs are large enough to accomade most peoples ears without squishing them against the padding.  The mic is removable if you don't want to use the chat/bluetooth option as well.<br /><br />The final reason for my purchase of this item was the fact that this headset is a universal headset.  It works with both PS3 (bluetooth) and Xbox360 with the included bluetooth controller adapter that discretely plugs into the port on the Xbox controller.  Seeing as it utilizes the optical video port on these consoles for the surround sound, my hopes were that this headset will also work with the next gen consoles as I am not planning on purchasing a new headset.  So long as the PS4 uses bluetooth and has an optical out for audio, this headset should work fine.<br /><br />Overall, this is the best headset money can buy and as per usual, I got it for a great deal on Amazon.com.  Paild $200 for this headset last Christmas whereas the regular price was $300 in Canada and occasionally came close to that on Amazon.com as well.
B000HKYBXA|4.0|A treat both lyrically& aesthetically. The only thing I find to somewhat critique is certain scenes the ghost is a bit carnival sideshow but I see what he was going for. If you know the play& have seen it, read it, etc this is just a blast- Kenneth Branagh doesn't really get anything wrong though does he ;)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was fun and made me think but there is a glitches on level 2. The passcode did not work on the little laptop computer. I had to use random chance for the next step.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Now I understand India a lot more. A great read. I am putting this book on my favorite top 10 reads.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It's Downton Abbey- what's not to love.  I am ready for another season.  It can't come soon enough for me.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|This album is the closest thing I've heard to the Sabbath I began to like back in the '70s. The many incarnations of the band after Ozzy left never inspired the same response from me as the original line-up. This album does. Ozzy sounds great, as do Tony & Geezer. While the technology has allowed Tony to sound cleaner and crisper, I kind of miss the fuzziness of his analog stuff. But he still plays wonderfully and Geezer is as powerful on the bass as ever. The drummer does a more-than-respectable job filling in for Bill Ward. Too bad they couldn't get that straightened out so the original line-up was all present. But the drumming is fine and there is no doubt that you are listening to Black Sabbath. I guess I would have to say that Black Sabbath without Ozzy just isn't Black Sabbath. On this album, you get the real deal. It sounds great.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Solstice is a fast paced and entertaining novella. As Dana leaves the security of the hospital after having some mental health issues, she is on her way to visit her sister, when her companion disappears. The question becomes: was he ever really there? Dana's reunion with Zoe doesn't go quite as planned and as the tension mounts, the story unfolds into fast paced thriller. The characters are interesting.  The story was well written and had a couple of unexpected twists.I liked the inclusion of relationships between people and animals, which occurred in more than one instance. Overall, I enjoyed the book. (Note: Though it wasn't specifically mentioned, I am absolutely certain that Alice was in the backseat, at the point when Mary Anne and the furry baby were waiting for Dana, but you'll have to read Solstice and form your own opinion.)
B0029LHW4U|4.0|This first post-Layne release is interesting in that it holds true to the AIC sound while at the same time being somewhat different than previous efforts. William DuVall adds a slightly different vocal quality to the songs, while sounding similar enough in pitch and tone to Layne Staley to keep the AIC &#34;sound&#34; intact. I don't get the sense that William is trying to sound like Layne, and that's a good thing. Jerry has written some good songs here and he is probably a bit more out front with his singing that in the past. This is a good album. It has some weak spots, but so did others in the past. Overall, I like it.
B000EUDAWG|1.0|It is too big in size. I was expecting too get batteries in the package.<br /><br />It hardly works on carpets. Even on flat surface it makes it moves slowly. Overall I am dissatisfied.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|I had the CD long ago and a friend had given me a DVD copy of the original VCR concert tape that had been converted and downloaded to a torrent. It was very cool, but the sound and picture quality were poor. This set is just the opposite. The sound and picture quality of the live show at the Moore is awesome. In my opinion, that show (and the video of it) is a classic.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|All the games are super fun. They cant all be played in one sitting with makes it a unique video game experience.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This is not the pre-Layne AIC, and that's not a bad thing. Don't get me wrong, I loved AIC with Layne and still think it's some of the best stuff I've ever enjoyed. But this band has shown an amazing ability to adapt, be eclectic and keep moving forward. The material on this album is stronger than the first one with William DuVall. It's obvious that Jerry Cantrell is more front & center as a singer on this one, although the dual vocals that have been a staple of AIC throughout their history stand out prominently here. Cantrell's writing is still creative and true to the original sound of the band. After a few listenings, I found myself as much in love with this album as any of their previous releases. Don't pre-judge...just give it a few listens and you'll see what I mean.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|This story really surprised me! It looked good and was one that I wanted to see, but I had my concerns that it wasn't going to be anything special. After watching it I can confidently say that it exceeded my expectations. The story was unique and had a twist that I didn't see coming until late in the story. It was a great action/mystery that I thoroughly enjoyed.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a very entertaining puzzle and is great for killing time or keeping kids occupied. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because I wish that they wouldn't charge for showing the solution.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Waiting for Season 4 now. My daughter watched it for the first time this summer, all three seasons. She's in love with it too.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|An expensive worthless piece of junk. GPS is extremely unreliable, at least for running on trails. Running on the same exact trail I get anywhere between 2.76 and 3.10 miles, the GPS accuracy never seems to go below 26ft.<br />Every now and then I take the watch from the charger (while displays \\"Charged\\") and then 20 minutes later it reboots and tells me the battery is low. Might have lots of bells and whistles, but it's an unreliable sport watch.<br />I've been trying really hard to get some use out of the money I paid for this watch but not anymore. It's transforming the fun of being outside and running into a continuous frustration. No more.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The books are amazing, great plot lines, I would tell anybody I know to read these books and Amazon is a great place to get your books!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very enjoyable.  Did NOT expect that &#34;secret&#34; at all.  Interesting wrap up to the story at the end.  Intriguing. Thought provoking.  Loved it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it best game every played it is challenging occupies a lot of time keeps you busy and my grandkids play this also
B007THA4FI|5.0|I read the book she wrote after this one and I liked it.I had read that the reviews were bad on Casual Vacancy . I 'm glad didn't listen.I think people were shocked because this was so different from HARRY POTTER.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|As with Mr albums works there are simple messages that are reasonable but without reading them passed over. Enjoy your time with the book
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Great game.  Requires concentration memory skills and thought.  Relaxing in that you concentrate on the puzzle and your mind is off the burdens of every day.
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|It's great but, if you want more than two levels you will have to pay a lot of big ones.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I am a Christian.  I don't agree with the conclusions drawn by Reza.  But I do respect the scholarship and can see how we would arrive at his conclusions.  I see no agenda by a Muslim to discredit Jesus in this.  I think people making that point perhaps haven't read the book.<br /><br />A Christian that is not well-read and not well-grounded in their beliefs may have difficulties reading this without it shaking them up a bit.  It did none of that for me.  His arguments are all easily responded to.  I was able to read it and even learned a few things about the life and times that Jesus lived in.  I found it an interesting read.<br /><br />What I didn't like was his rather arbitrary way of dismissing bible passages that didn't support his position as unreliable and then later on using others to buttress his points when they agreed.  Either the New Testament books are reliable historical records of the life and ministry of Jesus or they aren't.  Pick a position and stick with that.<br /><br />His conclusions are different than mine - very different.  My belief based on over 30 years of following Him is that Jesus is:<br /><br />\\"..the visible likeness of the invisible God. He is the first-born Son, superior to all created things. For through him God created everything in heaven and on earth, the seen and the unseen things, including spiritual powers, lords, rulers, and authorities. God created the whole universe through him and for him. Christ existed before all things, and in union with him all things have their proper place. \\"
B00819ER0Q|4.0|This is not typically Jim Carey fare. His performance was understated and compelling. Ed Harris portrayed the director with an iron will that became somewhat creepy. The film is thought provoking especially given the culture preoccupation with reality television.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really addicting and fun best in my opinion on a kindle fire bigger screens make the game easier to play
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Nice movie set in old times, with James Bond like hero who is not a professional spy, yet acts like one.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is a MUST READ for anyone on a quest for self-improvement, personal and spiritual growth and for simple and profound keys to living a better life and making a better world.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it love it love it love it it's the best and in my<br />Opinion the best-selling ham ever in the whole wide world!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|At first I thought it was to easy but it gradually gets harder. I love playing this while trying to pass time.one of my favorite games to play.
1932100660|5.0|How can anyone eat meat anymore, drink milk anymore, cook eggs anymore, or do anything with animal products?  It's obvious animals are mistreated at factory farms, and now this evidence comes out about animal products causing cancer.  I shake my head at a society that laughs in the face of evidence like this.
B008J34466|5.0|Loved going to the concert on tour and knew the songs ahead of time with this album.  She is a high energy performer and has songs even this 63 year old grandma loves!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|In this age of idiot programming we need more shows like Fringe. Thought-provoking, science based, intelligent formats should always have an audience to combat the dumbing down of American television. In this age of explosive scientific discovery, programs that provide excitement, plausible science, evildoers and even a little gore should have an audience. Try it, you'll like it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|When I first joined face book, I liked it but now there is too much junk.  Not on it as much.
B009T3AE1Y|4.0|Slow start, seemingly self indulgent.  But within a quicksilver shift this fable becomes witty, sardonic and an engaging tease for a certain kind of audience.  Cosmopolis won't have a broad appeal, but then that's part of it's appeal.  You'll know if you're the type.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|I've seen this only a couple of times.  My 3 y.o. niece isn't really interested in it.  But it's still a keeper for future viewing.  Maybe when she's older my niece will want to see it.<br /><br />Jack Black is still funny as the Panda guy.  The storyline is more for older kids as the humor is more mature. The characters are cute and likeable.  My younger male cousins likes this (and the tv series) because of the Kung Fo.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Scalzi has a very conversational, first person style, that I enjoyed. Humans facing the galaxy as well as a repressive government aren't new but he links the, vey well.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a true keeper in the kid collection.  My 3 y.o. niece absolutely loves this movie.  Gru is funny.  And the three girls (whose names escape me) are cute and funny.  And the Minions are my niece's and my favorite characters. They really stole the show.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Molly and Vivian are two women who have lived similar lives decades apart. This is a beautifully woven story of what the two endured, and the special relationship they forge through their experiences as well as the healing they offer each other. I highly recommend this book.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|(My 3 y.o. niece's first big screen experience and with both parents. I didn't go but she told me a bit about it. And according to her mom - my sister - she loved the movie. It was a perfect movie for those first big screen eyes. She's seen and liked the first Cars movie.  Now Disney has to make a movie about trains and they'd complete the cycle.).<br /><br />The screen was big, big, big, as big as the wall. I sat good and watched the movie with mom and dad. The planes were racing. And they were so cute. I had fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games ebook is the best by Suzanne Collins .  I enjoyed it very much. I will read more of her work.
B000MV9026|4.0|So I got this at Target for $5.  I think this is a pretty decent movie.  My 3 y.o. niece thinks this is cute.  We don't watch this movie very often and sometimes just watch little portions of it.  It's still a keeper though.<br /><br />The storyline is a little mature.  It's very creative and has a small amount of education to it.  Mumble is both adorable and brave. The actor's voices at times aren't noticeable.  Robin Williams I think stole the show as Ramon.  He was quite funny.
0307352153|4.0|If you or any friends are introverts, this is a must read.  Two people I know recently rated this the best they have read recently.
B000H5U832|5.0|(my rating is about a 4 star) 3 y.o. loved it.<br /><br />(So I own the dvd. And my niece has seen some of it before. I noticed that she'd loose interest at times because the characters would talk too much. I think there was just too much older kid and adult stuff. Like my niece has never before heard about Ferraris. And I had to explain why no one was going to Radiator Springs - even when Sally was explaining it herself. But the characters are great. The humor is funny. And it's been a keeper in our kid movie collection).<br /><br />According to my 3 y.o. niece while she was running around the house pretending to be a car: I watched Cars! And there was airplanes like the movie. When asked who her favorite characters were, well of course Lightning McQueen and Mater. Throughout the movie she was laughing and saying \\"silly Mater!\\"<br /><br />(So now Disney will no doubt make s movie about trains. lol)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It is one thing to read a &#34;cannot-put-it-down&#34; sort of book, but its rare that such a book can linger in your thoughts for weeks after finishing it. This book continues to visit my thoughts and that, I believe, is a measure of its power. Just wonderful.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|When it first came out, my family (and cousins and such) and I were attached to this movie instantly. We all love this and consider it our top favorite kid's movie.  Now my sisters both have toddler girls (3 and 2 y.o.).  This movie is the girls's favorite and that pleases us because we enjoy it as much as they do.  So if we need to watch it 3 to 4 times a week - Que Sera Sera.<br /><br />Our favorite characters are of course Woody and Buzz Lightyear. And from the other Toy Story movies - Jessie is mine and my niece's all time favorite Toy Story character.<br />We just recently went to Disneyland (in California) and went on It's A Small World with the girls of course.  Now it's been a few years since I've been to the park and it was my nieces's first time.  So you could imagine our surprise to see Disney characters on a lot of the rides now.  It's a Small World had the most newly added Disney characters.  And Woody, Jessie and Bullseye are some of the new additions to that ride.  My nieces were thrilled to see them there.  Us grown ups kind of rolled our eyes.
B009LRE040|5.0|My favorite superhero movie so far. Gets better every time I watch it! Really like the battle scenes and the plot!
B0039N74CW|5.0|This is a great modern fairy tale. Shrek the Ogre with plenty of attitude was perfectly done by Mike Myers. Eddie Murphy's donkey - named Donkey, stole the show. And Cameron Diaz did a decent job with voicing Princess Fiona. The evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) was more funny than evil. We've watched this movie numerous times. A true keeper in the kid's movie collection.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was afraid a cover would make the kindle heavy and bulky, this cover wraps the kindle enough to protect it while keeping it light. Love it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really fun and addicting but I wish there were more mini games. Also wish that there was more energy as you leveled up!!
B008JFUPK8|2.0|I was captivated by the trailers for Man of Steel, especially the first two or three of them. I really thought the film was going to delve into the psyche of Superman, to let the audience feel what it would really be like to be in his shoes. Those who've seen the film will remember a very brief scene where he learns how to fly. For me, this is what the movie should've expanded upon. I wanted to see a good hour and a half devoted simply to Clarke learning where he came from and what he was capable of - the joy or whatever feeling he might've had at being able to do the things he can do - all the nitty gritty of what it's like to have super powers. And I wanted it to be done in such a way that I'd buy the whole story, and I'd relate to it. To me this kind of exposition is what can really sell the character as a \\"real\\" person. Instead, the movie spent a grand total of about 10 minutes exploring the mind of Clarke. Beyond those 10 minutes, the film distances itself from Clarke's psyche and we're left with an unapproachable and larger-than-life character that I personally find boring. Moreover, the film's makers spent time during its promotion talking about how the film would be a serious exploration of the implications of alien life arriving on earth. In reality, the film didn't do any such exploration, and yet again we have to take it as a given that the human characters will just swallow the whole spectacle without question. Overall, the film failed to accomplish what I was hoping it would, which was to create a solid, well-developed, and plausible character for Superman, and instead gives us some sort of Transformers/Independence Day mash-up that I doubt will linger in our minds for more than a few minutes after the first viewing.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|It is a funny show. Now I must use up 15 words.  Bummer down to 8 words. Three more left.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|I was really disappointed with this movie, it was boring and extremely slow moving.  It didn't seem to have an interesting story at all
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book kept my interest from beginning to end.  Even though the story wasn't happy it was truly uplifting in the end!
B0015442YU|5.0|Anthony Hopkins is my favorite male artist, and this movie is suspenseful from beginning to the end.  The acting is superb and the story is exceptional.  I have repeatedly watched this movie over the years.
B0081KZ20E|5.0|I am 80 years old. I read The Day of the Jackal many years ago, and I only remembered a few things, but I remember that I enjoyed it a lot. So I purchased it again, this time the Kindle version and I loved it, AGAIN!
B00821OX98|5.0|I like the series.  I wasn't sure I would, consider &#34;Walking Dead&#34; gets rave reviews and I can't stomach the plot lines, gore, and numerous other standards of that show. The acting here is excellent and the story lines are solid.  The pace can be slow at times, but I believe it is to develop the emotional undertones of the plot.  Wish there were more series like this, with more emphasis on quality writing and story lines.
B007SGM084|5.0|Could not put it down once I started it!  Love to see a fourth book in the series.....I think it needs a continuation.....
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|This show is just a fun show. It's somewhere between a show and a series. There's not massive amounts of cliff hangers or anything, most episodes resolve themselves quite neatly and the dynamic between Harvey and Mike is very, very entertaining. Also, the side characters are fantastic as well!!!
B002DEZXOE|5.0|Fun reliving Woodstock.  Our generation of music that made our youth who we are. Great remembering the greats of the time.  Laughed at some of the things we did at that time. Remembering all the drugs seeing all the bare butts wondering who are corporate CEO's now and how they would feel if their grandkids saw this movie.  Sure brought back our own youth I was 19 at the time my husband was in Viet Nam so this was my youth.  Music was my life.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|I love this movie! It is touching me deeply by how much love the male lead 4 his son and wife!! Even before his death he still showed the joking face to his son in order for his son to be safe and stayed unfrightened in the game!!<br />Surely watch it again with my friends!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Started watching this because it was free on Prime and became addicted. I love lawyer shows and this is one of the best. The shows, in terms of acting and changing plot, is comparable to Scandal to me. If you like Scandal, I think you'll like Suits.
B0094K20FK|5.0|An important must see in the series.  Important to see before the second one of the new series for sure.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Easy but can stump you at times when you are looking for last item to get you to next floor :)
0740748475|5.0|Simply F- A- B- U- L- O- U- S. Binding is beautiful. I wish I was a tiger. Not a stuffed one, a real one.
B004DM0UII|4.0|I love this app. It's got lots of stations to choose from. Knave been using it for years and glad the updates have been a great UI improvement.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is intense from start to finish. It picks up right where Catching Fire left off. Mockingjay plot was very fast-paced but not extremely rushed like CF. This book did not so much have the \\"Peeta vs Gale\\" love triangle that I think a lot of folks anticipated and I'm okay with that. I expected the ending to be more twisted and controversial but it was very conclusive which I can appreciate. Great book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Addictive and very fun. Good for passing time! I originally played on my husband's iPhone but he always take  it from me so I HAD to get it for my kindle! Bigger screen anyway!
0062200909|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter after she just couldn't part with the borrowed library edition which couldn't be renewed for one more period of time!.....great price, very good used condition and seller sent in timely manner in good packaging. No comkplaints
B009QW85ZU|5.0|Another good Sean Connery/James Bond flick.  Of all the actors who've played James Bond, only Connery has the right &#34;feel&#34; and suave tongue-in-cheek air to pull it off.  Pierce Brosnan comes in a close second but Connery IS James Bond.
B00DE76PM8|1.0|You can only download a county at a time on each state, and you are only<br />allowed about 5 downloads then you have to pay for them<br />Not what I was looking for at all
B008Q0D9DG|4.0|This would be a better movie without the Rene Russo love-the-hero distraction.  A feel-good movie every time I watch it
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Vonnegut produced so many excellent novels, yet this one seems to be in the top few great works of his.<br />His social commentary does not take a back seat to anyone else in modern fiction. A must read for younger adults.
1595141979|5.0|great series loved them all i actually read them in a couple weeks couldnt put them down a must read
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Much like temple run and subway surfers.  Cool power ups.  My 11 year old thinks it is one of the best apps he has ever played.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book leaves your mind with an infinite amount of questions. It opens up doors  in your brain that you probably never knew of.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|It has been said here by another buyer that there are many other restorations of this movie, and how do we know this is the latest restoration. I will tell you now that this was restored in 2012 (new I think,duh) and it makes the orrigonal look like nothing I remember. This move on this disk is simply amaizing. The detail and colors, (I had not seen before HD) are brilliant. Anyone that tells you not to purchase this movie has no clue. This is much better than the orrigonal, and I thought it was the greatest.
1616551607|5.0|I have been eyeing this series of books forever! And in stores this set is priced much higher, I decided to check amazon and it did not disappoint! Very fast shipping, got here 4 days earlier than expected, package was in perfect condition and the art... amazing.<br /><br />Even if you are not familiar with Amano or Final Fantasy, this is a perfect buy for any artist/illustrator especially if you're trained in the fine art mediums. Really beautiful work to admire or study. You will not be disappointed!
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Our grand-daughter (10) picked this out for a family night movie. It was a great comedy and we had a lot of laughs. A good plot of good vs bad in this movie. A very appropriate happy ending which made this an enjoyable movie to watch, even for grand-parents.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I downloaded this unto my Fire Kindle. Mistake. I could never get this application to open. I tapped on the app on my Kindle, it went to a black screen, and it stayed there. Never opened up to the facebook page. I tried it numerous times over a period of a week or so. Ended up deleting it off my Kindle. I am not interested in this app. I don't know what was wrong with the app. The reviews that were there to read didn't say anything but good things. Those reviews help decide to get an app or not. ..... very disappointed with this application. I wouldn't even give it a star period because I didn't get to see the app open.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Great for gamers. Blows keyboards away and really helped reduce fatigue in my hand more than any gaming keyboard I have used in the past! Software is a bit confusing and the interface on screen could use some refining!
B008XG1X18|2.0|I am a HUGE pinterest fan and I was so excited when the app came out for kindle. However, the app doesn't let me repin anything and always says there was a problem connecting. Also, sometimes my notifications don't show up. I have gotten all the updates but it still does this... Not sure if it's a problem with my device or the app, but I am really disappointed. Looks like I'll be sticking to my computer for pinterest browsing.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|This is no Oscar winning picture but it us definitely worth watching if you like alien shoot em up type of movies!
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|A significant portion of the book is meal plans and recipes.  The science, which is well defended, takes a fraction of the space.  What is needed are case studies for different users of the program.  The Fast Diet Cookbook by Mimi Spencer looks like a better choice for recipes.  The BBC show Eat, Fast, and Live Longer covers the research basis for the diet.  You can watch the full documentary at [...] .
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I couldn't buy this fast enough when it came out because I worship The Kite Runner & A Thousand Splendid Suns- two of my absolute favorite books.  So disappointing.  :(  I kept waiting for the characters & multiple story lines to pull together (as his books always do) but to me, the book seemed to just sort of meander around never really creating deep connections or feelings for any of the characters then it just ends. I can't believe this was written by the same writer as the first two books. :(
B007MC8YLQ|1.0|great app.  I m addicted!  Easy to understand and a joy to play.  A fun app for people who love solitaire.
B004L03B3S|1.0|I think this was a good film, but the DVD just wouldn't play enough to see it.  I kept going back to the menu and trying scenes to see if I could get it to play.  I tried it on my computer DVD and it wouldn't play on that either.  Just a bad copy.  Sorry I didn't get to see it.
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|From the encyclopedia the facts are here: `The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.' Pretty well said and for those many of us who have read the novel that straightforward description serves Fitzgerald's story well.<br /><br />Enter Baz Luhrmann who adapted Fitzgerald's novel with his constant co-writer Craig Pearce (Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet, Strictly Ballroom) and director this Rose Parade Float version of Gatsby and the emphasis is different from the book - and that really is OK; it is a visualization of the raucous flamboyance of the Roarin' 20s pushed to extremes and decorated with Luhrmann's fetish for across time music themes and songs. The story remains intact for the most part as narrated by faux writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and the epitome of the American Dream Jay Gatsby is pasted on Leonardo DiCaprio while the vapid Daisy is well underplayed by Carey Mulligan. The spectacle settles down for moments offering some fine cameos by Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, spectacularly beautiful and talented Elizabeth Debicki in the small but significant role as Jordan Baker, Isla Fisher as the doomed Myrtle Wilson, Jason Clarke as Myrtle's husband George Wilson, and Callan McAuliffe as the teenage Jay Gatsby plus a `cast of thousands'. It places rich man poor man and the opportunities for role reversal at a new level and Luhrmann and company make that happen. Yes, it is overdone and over the top as is Luhrmann's style, and no, I wouldn't watch it again, but as entertainment on the grand scale it is not bad! Grady Harp, August 13ann's style, and no, I wouldn't watch it again, but as entertainment on the grand scale it is not bad! Grady Harp, August 13
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is a great takeoff of the classic arcade game.<br />  The defensive trees are a nice touch and repair points really aid survival.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|ive enjoyed moriary's previous books, but this one was painful.  i felt like it was too long and found myself scanning pages to get through to the end.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|This is a great action movie that is uniquely different from the rest of the action thrillers, I strongly recommend it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this story! It pretty much has everything : mystery, romance, humor, drama and heartbreak. I could not put it down and enjoyed every sentence. No skipping to the good parts in this one people, the whole thing was the good part. Fans of Picoult or Shreve should really enjoy it. Don't wait for it to be on the free list, it's worth paying for!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are so amazing. I could never put it down. The twists and turns in the books kept me on my toes. I felt every emotion and hardships that the characters went through. I strongly suggest that everyone read all of the books. You will not be disappointed with them at all.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 continues the saga, with all the excitement and intrigue you expect. Season 3 is a must see for all the Downton fans.
B00BUL3YQ0|3.0|I'm going to second everything N. Gibbons wrote in his review as it's almost like he read my mind. I bought this album without listening to any samples because I've loved/liked past Blackfield/Porcupine Tree albums. Well I'm sorry to say that was a mistake. This album is just plain disappointing. Very little creativity and SHORT, SHORT songs with the album clocking in at a pathetic 31 minutes (didn't realize I was buying an EP marketed and priced as an LP!). The reason I'm giving the album three stars is because songs like X-ray, Sense of Insanity, and Jupiter save it from being completely unlistenable. X-ray has great vocals from Vincent and an awesome melody. If you want to buy it do so, but expect a maximum of 15 minutes of decent music.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I love puzzle games and this game. It has so many different puzzles, that it makes it fun! I gave it 4 stars cause of the time limit it gives you. I would love to play the game with no time limit. But either way it's a GREAT game!!
0688156819|5.0|it was a little more morbid then I thought it was going to be but I still loved it! If you love tim burton you will love this book &#60;3
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|This is a great movie. I watched this for the first time at church camp as a teenager. I rewatched it to relive the laughs and so my nephew could enjoy it as well.
B004S5C8WG|5.0|it gripped you from beginning to end, its hard to put down.  has bought me back to reading Jeffery Archer
B00CWV9FQA|3.0|If you have played the video game then you don't need to buy this movie. I just got it because my nephew wanted to waych it. The movie is basically the storyline from the game.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Initially I didn't like this book as I found it way too introspective and frankly very slow. There were many times when I almost decided not to waste my time with a story I just couldn't get into, then wham! It totally takes off and it went from will I ditch this book to not being able to put it down.<br />Lots of twists and turns making it so interesting.
B004SDEP38|1.0|This app let's you download files onto your device from the computer and transfer them to another. Yeah, that's it. The lite version Isn't even worth the time to download. And the full version is 15$?!?! I'm sorry, but this is the most pointless app in this app store. My kindle fire can transfer without this app, so why should I use it?
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I had the Kindle for Android on my HTC EVO and never had an issue with it. Now that I have the Kindle on my Galaxy IV, I constantly have issues with it syncing up to the last page read. I may be doing something wrong, but I don't think so. Will give it more time.
B0041D843M|5.0|After digesting the concept, and initially trying the plant based philosophy, coupled with regular exercise, I have already noticed improvements. The medications for my diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol have been reduced. The paperback was so informative/effective, I purchased at least 10 for family/friends, and have also downloaded it to my IPad.  I am a believer.  I am 68 years old, but check back with me in 50 years for an update.  Until then, take care.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|In the book's foreword Walker Percy tells us how A Confederacy of Dunces saw the light of day. That is a remarkable story in itself. Let's waste no time and take a look at the book.<br />First we meet Ignatius J. Reilly standing under the D. H. Holmes department store sign, waiting for his mother. We soon meet patrolman Mancuso, Claude Robichaux, Jones, the mother. From there we meet other New Orleans' characters, travel the streets of New Orleans in a most interesting way.<br />Just as Walker Percy couldn't put the story down when introduced to it by John Kennedy's mother, I read and read. I think you'll have the same experience if you buy the book.
1616550414|5.0|It is a very big and beautiful book full with nice content, definitely it is a must have for any Zelda games fan.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not quite as good as the first two books, but still readable. It wraps up the story, but I didn't care for the ending.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|the scene detail was nice. the premise well thought but not fleshed out well enough. a little disappointing in it's. brevity.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Not for the pushovers! This ball takes a lot of patience, more than I have, but our family has fun challenging each other with it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another fabulous story/book by Khaled Hosseini! It is not a sequel to any of the previous 2 books he has written. It is a wonderful story, I couldn't not put this down. The book has many stories that the author starts to tell separately but by the end all are woven together, like a puzzle and finally all the pieces fit. The author has interesting tales to tell, gets you immersed into each character, their lives made vivid that you feel you are peering into a window. Nothing disappointed me about this book, a MUST read!
B00499QUK2|5.0|This show is filled with brilliant plots, excellent acting, and beautiful men.  Can't wait for season 3 to come out!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It worked wonderfully at first, then it started to crash and it wouldn't work. If the creator is reading this, please please PLEASE fix this used to be wonderful app.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I was in a motel and was trying to have a quiet evening while someone slept in the room. I wanted a movie that would grab me and hold my attention. This movie did grab me from the start and carried me to the end. It was one I really enjoyed it and it turned an evening of being quiet and bored so someone could sleep into a very enjoyable evening. I give it 5 stars for that!
B007HUD6OS|5.0|It was a great book and i loved reading it.  I have all of the Theodore Boone books and i love them.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|ONCE AGAIN I STICK WITH ORIGINAL PRODUCTS FOR MY ELECTRONICS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU INVESTED ORIGINALY IS WORTH PURCHASING THE CORRECT EQUIPTMENT SO THESE ITEMS CAN LAST THOSE $5.00 CHARGERS ON THE ROAD WILL DO MAJOR DAMAGE.
B00E9PXI3S|4.0|The film is good for what it was mild late night entertaiment theres no message. This is a film that is not to take serious it just brings Racheal mcadams back to form since Mean Girls. The film only suggest  but doesn't really have any graphic sexual scenes. Bascally its a cat and mouse game of two women who are at each others throats. The boss obviously likes the employee but the employee doesn't feel the same way. Instead she is involved the the same lover as her boss that wants her. So from there things get ugly and it just escalates into a total mess. Racheal in this film is basically a narcisist and spoiled lying Bit*h that wants everything her way or its the highway. Rapace is basically playing the victim and the nice girl that just wants to keep her job. It starts off like soft p*rn but then escalates into a crime thriller of who done it ? That was the main thing that kinda disappointed me about the film. I would have liked to see more of the cat and mouse game it was fun. But the last 30 mins of the film seem like a totally different film. Then there were some scences that even played out like a art film or a play. This is definitley not a bad film in my opinion but does play out like a 90's film or a rehash. It's definitley worth a watch if you like old style sensual crime thrillers. It is shot well and has some lovely locations and beautiful women in it. And most of all pretty funny and campy in some parts. This is a remake of a french film called LOVE CRIME which I thought was just ok. This was definitley is more appealing visually and is more fun overall. There are some slight variations in the films. The ending is different and how the evidence ended up in the other persons car made more sense in the original. But overall I think Brian De Palma's version was a bit more twisted and effective especially the ending.<br /><br />If you like this then check out :<br /><br />Shame<br />Girls against boys<br />Kiss of the Damned<br />Breaking the Girls<br />Stoker<br />The lifeguard<br />Byzantium<br />Albatross<br />Nobody Walks<br />Lovelace<br />Disconnect<br />The East<br />American Mary<br />Excision<br />Only God Forgives ( Takes Patience not like DRIVE)
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a time relax er.....love it. Can't wait to play again. Just don't want to spend my money. What a great pass time for all ages big kids and little.
B0026QC0TA|2.0|the book was far better.  The movie was a complete waste of time.  It drug on for what seemed hours.  If you hadn't read the book, you would be lost from beginning to end.
B00BD62X14|3.0|We bought this CD because of one song.....can't remember name right now. She has a wonderful sweet, mellow tune...we listen to this with our other dinner-type music.
193700788X|3.0|I have to say, the series ended as I expected it would. But, I was disappointed in the way the it got there. It took me awhile to get into the book, which is unusual. I couldn't get past the third person point of views, and when it was Sookie's turn, her voice didn't seem like her own. I had a hard time keeping up with the plot and all the characters thrown in there. Just by the cover, we knew we were going to see Quinn, Alcide, etc., but why? Their story lines and place in Sookie's life were already past. While I understand tying up loose ends for the readers with all of Sookie's past lovers (or potential ones), friends, and enemies, most of that could have waited for the \\"After Dead\\" book.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Of course Sookie was going to end up with Sam. It was hinted at throughout the series. I keep reading reviews where people are saying he's like a brother, she never had feelings for him, she wasn't bothered by the cluviel dor's influence on those feelings, etc. That's not how I saw it. A)She always had feelings for Sam that she kept buried. I don't know which book it was, but I know that they even kissed and there was a spark there. It's not like this was a total surprise. B) The cluviel dor unlocked her feelings, not created them. And C) Yes, Sookie is a strong woman. Why does that mean she needs to be in constant danger and upheaval? Who better to be with than someone who loves her for who she is with no other agenda? Was it executed badly? Yes. When I picked up this book I was expecting Sam for a good portion, if not most of the book. Not a quick wrap up at the end.<br /><br />And Eric.....it did make me sad to see the way Eric's story was wrapped up. It was a toothless version of Eric, and he acted out of character. Maybe he did the things he did and laid down and took it to protect Sookie? Eric has been my favorite character throughout the books and I didn't like to see him sidelined and neutered in the last two. But, again, of course Sookie couldn't stay with him forever. That was always a given. But it could have been handled better.<br /><br />**END SPOILERS***<br /><br />Once I clear this book from my head, I do plan to re-read the series. Again. I love these books, and although I'm not thrilled with how the last couple were written - maybe the series needed to end a couple of years back - it doesn't take away from how wonderful the rest of the series is. And I'm very glad that Sookie did get her ending, and didn't veer into ridiculousness like some other authors have done. (Ahem, LKH...). Although convoluted, it was (mostly) realistic. Don't let all the negative reviews influence your opinion, of course you must read this to end the series!
B00886XQO0|3.0|I got these to help my game play and while the audio is fine, the headset is heavy, restrictive and the microphone broke after about 2 or so months of use, so now I have a really expensive hearing aid.  To actually communicate with my team I have to wear my cordless earpiece and lose one ear's worth of dedicated sound, so I find it hard to recommend these to anyone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We watched the 1st and 2nd season on Netflix just this past month and could not wait to get the 3rd season so we'd be ready for the 4th season when it comes out on Oct. 13.  So captivating.  Bought it online here b/c so much more affordable and sooner than waiting for it on DVD.  We go running in the evening and then relax to watch a couple episodes and it is so hard not to watch a 3rd though we have to b/c we get up very early.  Though zombies are not realistic...it really hits the human core by how the characters deal with survival when the world is ending and there is no law and only raw survival while trying to hold on to humanity.  Sometimes so intense we can't watch another episode w/o taking a break.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Excellent plot, gripping suspense, humor and historical footage.  The acting was remarkable!<br />I am so impressed with Ben Affleck - I will certainly head to any movie he is a part of in the future
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It's good, just really up and down from an emotional standpoint. The scenes that are shot in the kitchen areas seem to be with a different camera and don't always blend well.<br /><br />It is evident from the 2nd episode that there is bound to me more seasons. Lots to cover and things move really slowly in the Downton world so you must keep patient.<br /><br />A good series and definitely entertaining.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Not every book has great book has detail. Some have enough for you to understand it. And some have lots that make you picture every little detail in your head. And this one has amazing detail! Some mispells and recounts but that's about it. ; )
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits has become my new addiction!  I love Harvey!!!!  It's suspenseful with new drama each week.  I have officially became a fan and need to catch up to Season 3!!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Shame they cancelled it. The actors were just getting into their characters and the writers were getting better. Bring it back!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|You need more than just one reading to fully grasp the beautiful message in this book. Insightful, more than just one read!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|This show started off slow but the writers and actors hit their stride before the end of the season though the series ends rather abruptly.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|I read no reviews of this movie prior to watching it, so I had few preconceived notions about it. Having viewed and enjoyed all of the other Die Hard movies, I expected this movie to be another fun outing in the series. While quite a bit different from some of the other Die Hard movies, this movie succeeds on most every level. It had plenty of the stuff I was expecting and wanting to see: loads of action, exotic locations, witty tough-guy banter, some despicable bad guys and some father-son conflict. Highlights of the movie include one of THE BEST car chases I've ever seen in a movie and a David-versus-Goliath battle between the main characters and a military attack helicopter. If you want more plot synopsis, I'm sure you can find plenty of other reviews to fill you in on those details. I'll just leave you to them and give you this recommendation: If what you're looking for is a fun, low-brow action movie to waste away an evening or afternoon with, this movie will definitely fit the bill and leave you entertained.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Mitch Rapp and can't wait to see him in theaters... such a sad event losing a great author such as Vince... he will be sorely missed.
6305047529|5.0|If you enjoy vintage movies, and vintage campy humor, you can't do better than this.<br /><br />Danny Kaye is wonderful as an innocent, accident prone milquetoast with a rich fantasy life. And the supporting cast is just, wow! The color and images are stunning.<br /><br />The script is brilliant...tongue-in-cheek and witty in the manner of some of the best writing from films in the 1930s, 40s and 50s. Ever see The Women? Same kind of laugh until you drop writing. You often get the impression there are two meanings...the &#34;obvious&#34; meaning for the general public, and the inside double meaning for the script writers and their little inside circle.<br /><br />Some think Danny Kaye was gay and that his scripts have a gay double-entendre. The evidence for Kaye's queerness is much contested (lots of debate about his supposed affair with Olivier) but either way I think it's clear that screenwriters of the time were so comfortable in the invisibility of gay culture that they had fun dropping a lot of double meanings in that back then went mostly unnoticed and today are just hilarious.<br /><br />Too bad this is out of print. Maybe they'll remake it. I paid $140 to get it used and I don't regret it.
140006922X|5.0|ZEALOT is a brilliant and much-needed contribution to understanding the historical Jesus---as well as the Christ of faith.  It is unique because it brings together centuries of scholarship and history in a meaningful way.  It both explains and contextualizes much of what is either generally not well-known or under-appreciated.  It places Jesus in the &#34;praxis&#34; of history---so that the reader gets to be familiar with the time, place and situation in which he lived.  It also explains other historical actors and events beyond the area in which Jesus lived so that we understand Rome and the vicious nature of the Roman Empire---as an empire.  Further, it is a book that explicates Judaism and the emerging Greek influence after the crucifixion of Jesus--- which turned his message into a truly universal message!
B00006FDCD|3.0|Being a fan of both scary movies and Tim Curry, I knew I had to pick this DVD up for movie night with my friend. Before buying this, I was not aware that this was a made for television 2 part special. You must flip this DVD middle way through the movie to see the second half. It is an outdated concept, really, and you would expect such a well known movie to have an updated disk by now!<br /><br />It is about a group of children who run into an evil clown. They must kill him and bring peace to their town. But little do they know, this will only keep the situation down for 30 years. The clown is back when they are adults! How will the defeat the clown once and for real? Well you must watch to see *insert evil laugh here*. The first half of the movie takes place in flash backs of the grown ups all individually remembering their part in killing and confronting the clown. The second half of the movie is about them meeting up after many years and going out to kill the clown again. I found the first half to be much more charming and entertaining, while the second half tended to drag on and the final scene was rather disappointing and not scary.<br /><br />For a television special, I found this movie to be be alright but nothing particularly memorable besides the Tim Curry's performance of It the clown. He was funny, creepy, and even made me jump at times. Classic! I also really enjoyed the children actors which included a young Seth Green, how cute. On the downside, some of the adult acting was rather weak and it was hard to take some scenes seriously. By the end of the movie, something seemed to be missing which kept this movie from being touching and moving.<br /><br />While I would not reccomend running out to see this movie, I did enjoy some scenes of this and thought it was a worthwhile if mostly forgettable watch. Not to mention, you can usually find it for under 5 dollars. Woo woo!
B007L5LD9O|5.0|I love Emma.Very touching story of a young woman bound to be spinster,who finds love for everyone but can't see that love for herself is right in front of her.Love Gwyneth.She's so ellagant:)

B00CLT31D6|5.0|Interesting read about how millionaires manage their money, plan for retirement and delay their gratification.  It includes examples of budgets, what kinds of cars they buy, the credit card they prefer, etc.  Inspirational and challenging book.
0061950726|5.0|Mrs. Kline, in telling the story of the orphan, was automatically comparing her life with the modern girl who was a ward of the court.  I found it fantastic.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I bought the limited edition and I am impressed with the detail of the heads. The tanks and display are nothing to talk about, but the heads are very detailed. I love the Walking Dead and this will go great next to my season 2 limited edition zombie head statue. I can't wait to see what the limited edition will be for the next season.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Been looking for a game similar to Lost City and this was perfect.  Took a while to solve so its definitely<br /> worth the money. Loved all of it!
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|What needs to be said about the Harry Potter series.  I bought this on Blu-ray for my grandkids for Christmas.  I am sure they will love it.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|Entertaining show, believable premise, good characters, quality acting and reasonably good scripts. The series as a whole sometimes seems a bit disjointed, but overall it is well done.  Disappointing that this show only went one season.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|When I received the bottle cutter I was so excited to use it that I neglected to read the directions completely thru and the first bottle I cut did not cut right. So after reading the directions and following them exactly I had huge success. This does exactly what I need it to do an plan to recommend it to friends that have been looking for a bottle cutter.  My only advice is READ the directions and follow them.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|You know it's a good album when you literally love every song that is being played. I would recommend this to many of my friends and possibly get the acoustic as well.
0802473156|5.0|I love this book and once you read it you can see some of your family and loved ones love language so clearly. It helped me clarify my husband and he was pleased that I was interested in bolstering our relationship.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I love the new feel and the theme the album follows through. Great messages in each song. I would definitely recommend this to many of my friends. I actually bought two albums as a birthday gift and an mp3 version for myself.
B0090XHWVS|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted! Works perfectly and left me extremely satisfied. Could not have found a better one!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|The game is very addicting and enjoyable. Spend lots of time playing it. I actually lose track of time. Like to play it so much because it helps me relax after a long day. Recommend it to everyone that likes to solve puzzles and search for things.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is now my favorite show and the drama mixed with the professionalism and class is obviously the major reason. The story gets better along the way in season 2 and they keep it quite humble.<br />This is a 5 star show.

0062119044|2.0|In We Need to Talk About Kevin, Ms. Shriver attempts to tell the story of events, reasons, undercurrents leading up to a school massacre. The story is told from the point of view of Eva, the mother of the murderer, in the form of letters Eva is writing to her husband.<br /><br />This is a very large undertaking and the premise is great. Ms. Shriver has an excellent story to tell, and at times it is well told and even gripping.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the very style of the story (letters describing events to a person who was there) was a draw back. It made for very awkward language as Eva told Franklin what he already knew (with such phrases as \\"You told me. . . \\", \\"You gave me. . . \\") and gave a very egocentric feel to the novel from the first page, as Eva describes her her life to one who knows it intimately. I suppose this was to set up for surprises later in the book, but it simply didn't work.<br /><br />The story of Eva's relationship with her husband and son would have made for interesting reading, but it was so hard to get past the fact that I was reading a novel, due to the self-important (and unrealistic) style and language. This is \\"a novel\\", and the reader is not going to forget it. There were times, though, that the story was interesting enough for me to over look this (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), but those instances were few.<br /><br />In addition, We Need to Talk About Kevin is simply too long. Ms. Shriver spends too much time on details and issues that don't add to the story and that could easily have been pared. Other school shooting incidents discussed in detail, the 2000 election fiasco in Florida referred to again and again, feelings examined in minutiae. . . This book weighs in at 400 pages in oversized paperback, and would probably have been a good novel if 1/4 of that had been left out.<br /><br />Another difficulty I had with We Need to Talk About Kevin was the discussions (generally arguments) between Eva and Franklin (recounted in detail by Eva to Franklin despite the fact he was there) about their son. These conversations were not realistic, read like how a young person might imagine adults talk, and certainly did not read like adults talking about their own children. Perhaps Ms. Shriver intended this, used it show the difficulty between Eva and Franklin. Perhaps, but to this reader it did have any purposeful use, and made reading even more difficult.<br /><br />Due to the over-scrutiny, the self-importance and the length, by the time the book ended, the \\"surprise\\" was no surprise and the ending was simply a relief. If Ms. Shriver had kept with just the basic story, and had Eva give it in a different format, this could have been a stellar read. As it is, I advise you give it a miss.

B000VUCIZE|5.0|I was really impressed with Sam Harris' arguments and style of writing. In my case, he was preaching to the choir, but I definitely found some several new interesting areas for discussion and consideration.

B00BVMXBVG|5.0|I'll never understand why lead actress Tatiana Maslany wasn't nominated for an Emmy award for her work in the first season of Orphan Black. She plays seven different characters and there's never any doubt as to which one she's playing. She's so good that even when two or three of her characters appear in the same scene, you're not even aware that they're all being portrayed by the same actress. The rest of the cast is no slouch, either. Jordan Gavaris in particular deserves special mention.<br /><br />As for the show itself, it's well-written, intelligent science fiction that hits the ground running and just never stops. I watched all ten episodes over the course of three evenings, and can't wait for season two. The Blu-ray picture quality is excellent, but these days, that's to be expected. The supplements are interesting and informative, although somewhat brief. A couple commentary tracks would have been a welcome addition.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted! Works perfectly and left me extremely satisfied. Could not have found a better one!
B00CATONCA|2.0|DVD's are 5 stars, but this floating heads is not worth the cost.  Very cheaply made, heads keep falling off hanger, no instructions, leaks when you put in water,  When trying to get to battery, the screw was so tight it almost stripped screw head. I would have thought that Todd McFarlane would have made something of better quality His other figures are mush better quality than these heads,

B003H4I4JU|4.0|While this book was completely different than Enders Game, I found it to be very interesting and though envoking.  Orson Card is an excellent writer so even thought the premise was &#34;out there&#34;, it was interesting to read.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|My daughter loves it. It's the quality I was expecting. It was packaged in original packaging. I would definitely order again.
B0034C9CFK|5.0|Great CD! Alan Jackson is the best! You will love and thoroughly and enjoy  this cd! The best Country Music!
B0014GVCI8|5.0|Juno is one of those awkward, heart warming movies, it is a(n) amazing, amazing movie. I would definitely recommend it.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|The first book, Matched, had so much heart, and I was really rooting for Cassia and Ky to be together. There was adventure, suspense, mystery, forbidden romance, and an intelligent plot. In short, all the elements I love in a good read. In Crossed, the characters didn't even seem like the same ones from the first book. The storyline  dragged endlessly, and seemed to be nothing more than a bridge between Matched and Reached, which is often the case with YA trilogies.  Add to that the way in which Cassia and Ky meet up again, and it had me rolling my eyes in disbelief.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Apparently Kindle &#34;updated&#34; my FB application to the android version.  No desktop or timeline.  I called for tech assistance and they recommended that I download this app - which is also the android version.  I guess I supposedly can download the desktop/timeline version for a minimal cost - but I can't find the link.  Right now I'm very Kindle weary and disappointed.
B004VFOS2Q|4.0|Truly a classic with wonderful actors and music and costumes-Arthurian tales- A chick-flick for sure. Guys take notes! Love It!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|the fact that you only get very few tokens per hour sucks donkey balls. their needs to be a much easier way to get tokens or this game is going to be a huge fail
B006IS6CK0|5.0|Ava Gardner was fantastic and always a beatiful woman. Gable was terrific as the Chauvinist Great White Hunter. Grace Kelly as the insipid and inexperienced wife was painful to endure.<br /><br />John Ford is masterful using natural locations to tell the story.<br /><br />This was Africa in 1953-54 before the Colonial powers abbdicated their powers and regional control in Africa so its also a bit of glimpse into colonial history.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat - I didn't want to stop reading it. However, for all the suspense and excitement that goes on throughout the book, I felt that the ending was quite a bit of a let down; like the author had this great idea for the bulk of the story but was lazy with the conclusion.
B005R32L66|4.0|Easy way for me to chat with my son thru video. Handy for hearing impaired people. Try it and rock it.
B000WOT41K|5.0|This band is the most progressive band ever. Hard, strong, soft and melodically well performed.<br />Who knows only one song from them, this album is for you.<br />For their fans this album is not so worthy.
B00C4QLUFM|5.0|This movie has been around for a very long time and yet is referred to in movies as an example of what can happen if you believe in love.<br />I watched a move called &#34;Friends with Benefits&#34; and it was mentioned in the movie as the impossible becoming possible.<br />I love it because it was a lesson in something rare and beautiful and, being a romantic myself, it is nice to believe ..in anything can happen when you least expect it,  even when the odds are so seemingly impossible, it happens anyway.<br />Also a great lesson for women to want what they want and not compromise their dreams and settle for someone else and lose sight of the &#34;big dream.&#34;<br />This film took everyone by surprise, a prostitute and a ruthless business man and they were both screwing people for money, so they had more in common than anyone thought in the first part of the film.<br />I think that this movie is a &#34;classic&#34; and will be around for a very long time.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Which I watched almost non-stop. I have been a Laura Prepon fan for years. The part she plays in the series was no let down!  The book , I bought due to the questionable ending to the series and wanted to follow it on for completion.  Unfortunately, the book is/ was for all purposes a completely different story and the players were nothing like the series. Very disappointed in the book!<br />Still haven't finished it!!!<br /><br />Bill
B007EC27QM|5.0|A calculator I can carry with me without carrying it with me!  I CAN't lose it, drop it or break it either.  What can you buy these days for 99,,cents !
B0041T52S6|1.0|When I opened the package I noticed the DVD disc box release tab was broken and the disk was scratched up and dirty, the movie is a favorite of mine but the product it self was a mess
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This hand really conforms to my rather large hands.  The extra buttons seem very solid and the weight of the mouse is ridiculously light, so I ended up putting all the weights in it.<br /><br />I have bought a few other products from Anker and at this rate I will still continue to do so as all of them are fantastic.  Their customer service is also exceptionally great.
B000IHQTIW|5.0|These sandals have excellent support and are extremely comfortable.  I did have to order a size 11.5 as the first pair that I ordered were too short and they were size 11.  In other Keen's that I have purchased, an 11 fit well.  However, the Amazon return process is so easy that a return is no big deal.  In the end, I was very happy.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|One of my favorite live albums. Almost perfectly done. Great job! What else can I say. This is a great collection of UFO hit recordings.
B000001F76|4.0|Hank Williams is good, but in this recording there were more songs that were sad, blue or down right depressive than there were songs that expressed fun, joy, romance.  This was not a good choice for my elderly dad who tends to be depressed much of the time as it is.
B00B2LPYNE|4.0|I love the intensity that Hatebreed puts in to their music. You can't help but bang your freakin head when listening to their songs and this one is no different as far as that goes from their other ones. All in all, I would give it 4 stars all day long. Definitely worth picking up if you haven't already.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I purchased these on the advice of a friend who has had the headphones for over a year now and has not had any problems with them and absolutely loves them, I am one of those unlucky folks that seems to have not had such a wonderful experience with my purchase.  I bought these back in February of this year (2013) and I must say that I have not been 100% satisfied with them.  I do like that they are wireless, comfortable to wear as well as noise canceling when you have them on, when they are working they are just fine.  Like I said though I am not that lucky to have no issues with mine and I am fed up with how they have been performing lately.<br /><br />I did notice that my headphones were not holding a charge very well, so I went ahead and let the battery die on me while wearing them and then charged it from 0 to full overnight and that seemed to fix the issue of not holding a charge.  My main problem with these headphones is the constant (and randomly starting) buzzing that happens in them and gets to the point where they will turn off on their own or I have to turn them off and let them sit for one minute to five minutes.  It might not seem like much, for the cost, these headphones should not be messing up this way especially for only owning them for six months.  This is enough of a nuisance that I do not feel this item is with the money.<br /><br />I will be returning my item as soon as I can.  I gave them a chance and they just continued to frustrate me.  If you do end up buying these I wish you the best of luck and hope that you are one of the lucky ones that does not get that buzzing, if it wasn't for that these headphones would be given a higher rating.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|This is a decent album. Nothing special to me but it's worth a listen, especially if you can still get it cheap like I did.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|If you love hidden object games then you will love this. It's a long game where you have to unlock the different pictures by solving a jigsaw type puzzle (or skipping it by using crystals). Aside from the pictures, there is a memory match, pipes, and blocks. The only thing I'm not fond of is that if you need a lot of help by using various tools, they either cost crystals or coins which can be bought with real money.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|This is one of those albums that improved with each listen for me. Now, I can't stop listening to it!  It's great!  I love the old-school hard rock throwback going on here.  Powerful and LOUD!
B00BYISQTO|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album, Matt Berninger's baritone vocals are sounding the best they ever have. The National fill their songs with many layers of music and melody that slowly reveal themselves after repeated listens. You may not instantly love this album, it grows. It becomes the album you listen on the main Hi Fi, in the car and on the PC. I can't get enough of it. Highlights I Should Live In Salt, Demons, Graceless to name but a few. Discover this band at their best. I think this is the best National album.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|If you want to change you body this book will show you how. If you read this book and don't make a change you are simply not ready.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I really like this chat service more than others. Try it you will like it too I guarantee it. KIK kicks
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Tough to gain points you need as the game progresses. Still fun though. Very challenging. You can't just unload your ammo and expect to win. Brings back memories of playing the arcade version at our corner c-store.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I just finished reading this book.  I don't often read self help books but this was suggested by a very good friend and I very glad she did.  It makes so much sense and I feel I learned so much about how our food affects us in so many ways.  I have started to reduce my own wheat consumption and have lost weight and feel much better.  I recommend this to people who are having issues with wheat, but also people who just want to understand how our bodies respond to what we are putting into it.  These days, the food industry seems to be more interested in the bottom line than our health!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a puzzle game that's not frustratingly difficult, but just challenging enough to become addictive (if only there were enough levels to become addicted). Love it...more please!
0761169253|5.0|But, whatever you do, get this book in your lart library.  Sounds like a wierd and strange title, but it is great.<br />Fascinating and interesting.<br />Books that I rate either get 5 stars or 4.  If I cannot rate them any higher than that, they usually go back and I usually do not mention them.<br />I appreciate having good books in my art library and this is one of those books.

B008EKOIN8|2.0|I read this book for a book group and it was awful.  It drags and lots of information that I just don't care about knowing.  I would never recommend this book.  Probably better for a college course.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|I'm glad this was a free app. There is no explanation on how to play this game. My grandsons can't even figure this one out.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Usually I can't watch movies that make me cry this much. Or if I do, then I never plan to watch it again. But THIS movie I want to watch once a month for the rest of my life. So moving and also respectful to those who suffered this disaster.
0375703764|3.0|overall it is a good book, but one page was missing. Very interesting and unique story... wow, I didn't know there was now a word count requirement for review.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|I like Kevin Spacey and he was vintage Kevin Spacey in this moive.  The movie is fiction but it makes one wonder how much of it is fiction.  As usual Kevin Spacey was excellent.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who like interesting material.
B005UG542S|4.0|This movie kept me awake. Nothing like the book, I liked it anyway. Of course it has been some time sense I've read the book.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn spins a good tale -- one that I enjoyed around a pool on Isla Mujeres. I highly recommend.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Why it took me so long to see this movie is beyond me. I wanted to catch it in theaters but just never got around to it. This movie was great from start to finish, and the acting was superb. So if you haven't seen this movie yet or just want to add to your collection I highly recommend this movie, so long as your older then 18 of course.  ;-)
B00338QENI|5.0|This is one of the most informative and amazing books I've ever read. Henrietta's unusual (still living) cells have contributed to research and cures in a way that most of us cannot comprehend. The science of how her cells has changed the landscape of modern medicine ... well, just taught me things I'd never had researched on my own.<br /><br />And the emotion of the story is overpowering. This is a page-turning experience.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|good story line and  cgi effects  to  receate the pier  and time  period, you will not be disappointed in watching this and staying hooked.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) is a fascinating character -- and, like most of the lawyers (and investigators, FBI agents, cops, etc.) on the show, is emotionally tamped-down. The fun is in trying to read them as they try to read one another. One of the most remarkable things is how she evolves over time, which is something that's best appreciated when watching in more concentrated doses. (I haven't watched a network show -- i.e., a non-premium channel or non-basic cable series -- in years, but I've been watching this one, two or three 40-minute episodes late at night, for weeks and am heavily addicted.) The cast is loaded with terrific, distinctive actors (not just Margulies, but Josh Charles, Christine Baranski, Alan Cumming, Archie Panjabi, Matt Czuchry, Zach Grenier, Titus Welliver...) and guest stars in delightfully eccentric, sometimes recurring, roles (Dylan Baker, Martha Plimpton, Peter Riegert, Michael J. Fox, Dennis O'Hare, Jane Alexander, Ana Gasteyer, Rita Wilson, Michael Ealy, and many more). It also has a great look (series DP Fred Murphy also shot John Huston's &#34;The Dead,&#34; Paul Mazursky's &#34;Enemies: A Love Story&#34; and Larry Cohen's &#34;Q: The Winged Serpent&#34; [!], among many others). I've tried to watch some other old-network shows (like &#34;Under the Dome&#34;), but they're so badly written, acted and constructed that I can't stand 'em. &#34;The Good Wife&#34; isn't in the same league as &#34;Mad Men&#34; or &#34;Deadwood&#34; or &#34;The Sopranos,&#34; but it's the kind of absorbing, adult show the networks are going to have to produce if they want to make anything besides &#34;reality&#34; programming.
B0040GURF8|5.0|This guy can play, and sing, and the songs aren't bad either.  Plays like Stevie Ray (with maybe more precision) and sings like Dave Matthews (with definitely better enunciation).. with the heart of a blues player...  From the pop stuff I'd heard before - I thought he was some kind of pretty faced starlet magnet papparazzi target - and maybe he's that - but don't underestimate him - this guy is one of the rare talents of his generation.  Not an innovator - but a real talent that shines through.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|It is a compact, accurate weather forecaster. Cleanly presented and easy to use. I appreciate it's rapid loading and simple display.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watching this series you actually begin to feel like you know these characters and you are emotionally involved in their lives.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|If you have never heard Josh Groban, you may be pleasantly surprised at his range and emotion through each and every song he sings.  He can sing in English or other languages and it seems like it all is so natural to him.  If you have heard him and like him, this is just one more to add to your collection!
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|To much action of the same thing. It kind of got boring.<br />I loved the actors. A lot of violance.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Enjoyed again after many years! Read and listened simultaneously it was captivating, although, I do think I still would rather read it than listen.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan since the 70's and I must say this is just as wonderful as the original Star Trek movies.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Usually with these things something always goes wrong with compatibility but this was truly plug in and play, definitely worth the money, well done Google

0345529057|5.0|Even if you've already watched every episode of the TV series, go ahead and read the books too. The show does a great job for the most part when it comes to including all of the important scenes, but theres certainly a lot more that you can glean by reading the books. I actually found that it was helpful to have watched the TV series first. I don't think I'm veryu imaginative when it comes to creating images of people in my head based on book descriptions, so the the show really helped in that sense. I also would have been totally lost trying to imagine the layout of the book world and the relation of all of the major characters to eachother if it hadn't been for seeing the TV series first. Definitely a great buy and worth every penny.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really liked this book, but after the first chapter, realized I had read it before.  Re read it anyway, as it had been awhile and I couldn't remember the details.  Good psychological thriller.

B00DPY95D6|5.0|Right from the start, you realize Chomi Prag's Cult of Mirrors is a book you won't be putting down until you have read the last page.  The story will not only cast a shadow of doubt on what you think is real, but it'll have you questioning the façade of privacy for a long time!<br /><br />Intelligently crafted, this book offers layers of drama, suspense, and unforgettable action scenes that build in intensity for the main character, Cheryl.  When reading this, it's easy to become so entwined in the story that you'll find yourself restlessly turning the pages, eager to learn Cheryl's fate.<br /><br />With such an action-packed story line and exciting characters, this book would appeal to a wide range of readers. It's been a long time since I've read a book I wasn't able to put down, and this one is a must-read and not only a great story, but also very relevant to our nation's current difficulties with stalking and privacy.<br /><br />Cult of Mirrors is everything you would want in a thriller and one of the most suspenseful books I have ever read. This compelling story grabs your attention in this mesmerizing thriller from beginning to end. Exciting, entertaining, and enjoyable read. Highly recommended!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I'm a longtime Michael Connelly fan.  He is an intelligent writer who has working knowledge of police and courtroom practices (was maybe a crime beat reporter at one time(?) - or maybe I'm making that up).  I love his Harry (Hieronymous) Bosch character - am always a bit disappointed with his books that don't feature Harry.  Best are his early works;  more recent writing seems to have lost its edge.

B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love how it is not full of lost of crap and bad words in the movie. I also love how it is a romance,
0307887448|3.0|Of all the novels I have read about the internet, including \\"Snow Crash\\" and \\"Necromancer\\", this is the most believable.  Having said that, there are still some issues.  For example, the main character has numerous movies memorized.  I have met people who have whole movie scripts memorized (and much to my chagrin, have proven it), but never more than one.  Another flaw in the book is that it reads like \\"Ivanhoe\\".  That is, there is action and reaction, but you don't get into the characters' minds nor understand their motivations, per se.  There is no internal conflict/struggle; it is simply good versus evil.  In that regard, the book is somewhat boring.  The reason I gave it 3 stars, rather than just one, however, is that it is entertaining.  Two types of people would really like this book.  In the first group, there are those like myself who grew up in the 80's.  There are a lot of moments where you say to yourself, \\"Oh yeah, I remember that!\\"  In the second group, there are the teenagers who like action and video games.  While some of the references will be lost to them, they would still like the tone in which it is written.<br />  There are some interesting points about the novel.  The first is the value of a name.  Ever since Ulysses told the Cyclops his name, and then when the Cyclops prayed to Poseidon to destroy Ulysses, the value of a name has had extra significance.  In this story, too, the value of a name is of paramount importance.  That would make an interesting discussion point for 7th and 8th graders.  This point could be extended further to that of identity (what makes a person who he is) for high school students.  Another interesting point is that society is falling apart and most people are fairly fat mainly because everyone is playing video games.  The author alludes to this at several points in the book.  As an older teacher, I see this happening today.  Kids are so distracted with videos and games that they are not studying nor developing outsideinterests.  I have seen students flunk all of their classes because they have gotten into online gaming.  It used to be drugs and alcohol that were the bane of society.<br />  One final point about the novel that I found disturbing.  The preaching of atheism appeared twice in the book, and there was no need for it.  Those pages appear because the author wanted to say something, not because they moved the story along or contributed to the plot in any way.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I've always found the Bible to be very hard to understand.  This book explains a lot....it was written as fiction in parts, and had historical influences that are mainly unseen.  Bottom line, a Jewish community took a relatively uncommon mystic...Jesus...., and turned him into a focus to lead them out of a horrible oppression by the Romans.  Then Paul invented a non-Jewish version, that of Jesus (the) Christ and made him accessible to non-Jews.  Paul wrote a lot of letters promoting his views, even though Rome, and the Jewish community didn't &#34;buy&#34; his invention.  Some 200 years later, Constantine convened a conference to sort out what was and wasn't Christian doctrine.  It was voted on, and since Paul's was mostly the only written accounts, his invention became Christianity as we today know it....even though the original followers of Jesus would not recognize it.

B007MDB71O|4.0|When John Carter came to theaters, I enjoyed every minute.<br /><br />The film captured the wonder and adventure of the pulp hero of the 1930s and '40s with some amazing special effects and solid storyline. When critics and fans ignored the film or bashed it, I thought -- perhaps -- I had been overly generous and needed to view it again.<br /><br />Watching John Carter on Blu-ray brought that same wonder into our home. The quality of the film transfer is outstanding, and the score is magnificent. I still think this movie rocks, and encourage people who were put off my negative reviews to give it another chance. The fault in this film is not the quality of the story or the quality of the production. Both are great. John Carter is simply the victim of poor marketing by a company that didn't know what to do with it.<br /><br />In another time or place, it could have been another popular adventure franchise on par with Indiana Jones or The Mummy. But small things, like changing the title from \\"A Princess of Mars\\" or \\"John Carter of Mars\\" to simply \\"John Carter,\\" proved to be a stumbling block for this outstanding motion picture.<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray. Watch it. And you'll see that adventure lives.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|We meet the Zealot, Jesus Christ, but he's kept always aloof and apart.  You can know of him but never Him directly.  Perhaps it's because he never actually wrote anything himself but was always written about and made to conform to the necessities of his followers that we can never really feel as if we've met the man in the title.  It was a wonderful and quick read to learn about the times in which he lived, what preceded him and especially what followed.  If you're new to the sub-genre, your eyes will undoubtedly widen with new knowledge.  If you come at this book with an unshakable point of view, you will be severely disappointed.  This is not the book that you wanted.  However at the end, when Aslan says that Jesus the man was as worthy of being admired as Jesus the Christ, you may wonder why you still don't feel as if you know the man as well as you would like to.  It definitely feels at the end as a complete 360 degree loop -- the part where you say &#34;Oh well, it's all about faith; isn't it?&#34;

B00ELIKDXG|5.0|The Lollipop by Julia Gousseva begins where her previous story, The Firebird, left off. The two kids, Alex and Katie, just back from their previous adventure to retrieve the magic feather, awaken to their Russian heritage and wish to unearth more of its charm and meaning.<br /><br />Right off the start, &#34;Here is the real ending of the firebird story,&#34; says Alex, as he opens the old book of fairytales. To his surprise he finds that the ending has been rewritten: &#34;Alex and Katie left the magical meadow and went back to Aunt Katrina's house. They healed her leg, and they all lived happily ever after.&#34; This revelation has a subtle meaning for the entire story, suggesting that history can be altered by your actions, and so you possess the magic to alter the world.<br /><br />This time, Aunt Katrina introduces the two kids to a new fairytale, about Emelya, the youngest of three brothers who captures a talking fish. In turn for being let off the hook, the fish grants him three wishes. Emelya's third wish, to mary a fair maiden, ends up backfiring, as the tsar is enraged that his daughter falls in love with a commoner.<br /><br />The words have faded on the page, and Aunt Katrina explains, &#34;This story has an end, but the end is yours to create.&#34; With this, the kids set off on a new journey, to help their fairytale hero, Emelya. At first they are guided by ball of golden thread, meant to lead them to their target and then bring them back home. But unlike the mythological Ariadne's thread, this one must be used sparingly. Dropped accidental too early in the journey, it forces the kids to resort to their own devices along the way. They meat the great Leshi, a creature who likes to confuse people, and princess Maria, the tsar's daughter who appreciates their willingness to help her.<br /><br />Will Alex and Katie find a way to release Emelya? More importantly, how would they go about their mission? In the end, the solution lies not in outsmarting the enemy but in allowing him to open up to new possibilities, see things a different way.

B008JFUPK8|2.0|Besides Star Trek Into Darkness, this was literally the disappointment for my summer 2013 movie viewing. The only thing this movie set out to do for me was take my money providing no real entertainment value. It's an overrated mess of a story for the first true comic book super hero.<br /><br />The &#34;S&#34; stands for shaky.<br />Zach Snyder's cinematography for this movie is such a joke. I'm not talking about the sets, super use of CGI, or look of the film. I'm talking about his over use shaky hand cam he used to film this thing. Every scene, and I'm being serious here, had a shaky documentary effect that proved to be more annoying and completely pointless when watching this film on the big screen. I thought the Hunger Games was annoying. Heck no, this blows that shaky cam issue out of the water! Also there are segments of &#34;scenery&#34; of object emphasis that I thought was tailored only for that teaser trailer that ran in front of the Dark Knight Rises. You get that here no matter what, ladies and gentleman. And to top it all off we have another over used camera effect for almost every CGI scenes. A very Battlestar Galactica (redo series) zoom in tactic when anything flies or falls down in this movie. It becomes so predictable with Hans Zimmer score that you could literally turn it into a drinking game. The Dark Knight Trilogy, hell Pacific Rim's, action scenes are tame to Man of Steel's calmer sections. Why do we need to shaky cam a conversation between Pa Kent and young Clark and why do we need to zoom in on Lois's escape pod as it falls to the ground when we clearly see it the first angle? The fight scenes are what you call the meat and the bones of this feature. Some seem to just go on and on like I was watching a hyper violent Anime like Dragon Ball Z. Don't get me wrong here, Zach's intention of Kyrptonians fighting each other would be on the same destruction plane as this, but at least make them interesting and not a chore to get through.<br /><br />The &#34;S&#34; stands for Superfluous.<br />Oh boy, then the plot! Which had either too much going on or ended up confusing it self with the littlest things. Because we know if Christopher Nolan is involved as producer and David S. Groyer is here to write the story, then we're going to have things overly explained. Segments like the atmosphere issue with Kryptonians, Kal-El being the first natural birth in awhile, the Phantom Drive and exploratory machines, and the codex felt like moments from the infamous plot shotgun (where writers throw ideas into one barrel then blast it at the wall and try to make sense out of it.) Story elements like these could have been explained easier or completely cut out. Remember Superman II, people? The explanation for why Zod and his lackeys are super powered were explained in 5 minuets. NOT ALMOST THE WHOLE MOVIE. So I'll get this out of the way then: If Groyer states that a Wonder Woman movie is impossible to write, but Marvel literally lets a talking raccoon use a machine gun, then I can honestly say that Groyer knows nothing about how to make Superman interesting. I mean they put Zod into this movie for the sake that he is the villain mostly everybody remembers from the old Superman movies. While we don't get any amazing lines like &#34;KNEEL BEFORE ZOD!&#34; We get a muddled CGI science fiction plot that was mixed with action scenes that overstayed their welcome. I'm going to say they should have made a live action version of the first three episodes from the Superman The animated series cartoons (seriously, go watch them!), because the technology reeked of a different villain. &#34;Nah! We'll just use Zod again. Everybody knows Zod. And I like redoing old movie stories. Nobody would would like Brainiac&#34; as told in my interpretation of David S. Groyer's mind.<br /><br />The &#34;S&#34; stands for Sub-par.<br />There is no point in going into the full detail of the main actor's Superman because he's about as interesting as apainted brick. He's there to look shiny, but there is not real oomph to it. I have no idea where critics get the idea that the supporting cast was purely awesome.  Amy Adams became the weakest link in the whole bunch with Kevin Costner being bland as ever. No wait, Kal-El's mother was the bland 2 X 4 here. I'm assuming that Kyrptonioan physiology must be that different from humans, but come on! You just gave birth the kid with the imminent destruction of your home planet! I know I would be bawling my eyes out. I guess Russell Crowe's &#34;space ghost dad&#34; had some good moments. But because the bleakness of this film, it was hard for me to enjoy most of the acting performances presented. If there was any charm, wit, or humor, well, I certainly didn't notice that much. Like, why am suddenly supposed to care about Jimmy Olsen's replacement? Why am I more of perplexed instead of saddned of Pa Kent's random death? The only person here who knows to bring his &#34;A game&#34; to the table was Michael Shannon as Zod. If nothing else, watch it for him, and the commercial placement getting wrecked because they had more characteristics than the rest of the cast. Seiously, the movie should have been called &#34;Zod Breaks Steel.&#34;<br /><br />The &#34;S&#34; stands for Sort of?<br />So did I enjoy anything in this movie? Pretty much anytime the camera wasn't shaking or zooming in. Like the epic science fiction Kyrpton segments that showed scale of the Phantom Zone drive. There were scenery shots that reminded me of some of my favorite comic book moments. For example, when Superman finally reveals himself, that scene was something like reading Alex Ross's Kingdom Come. Hans Zimmer's score here is now one of my favorites of his. While there is no triumphant John Williams theme that can make adults and children hum at anytime, this score is full of emotions that makes you want fly or fight for humanity...you know while you destroy your beloved city in the process. When Superman and Zod finally fight just each other, I was actually entertained. I thought to myself, &#34;this right here is what I paid to see.&#34; Hell, I wasn't even shocked by what Superman had to do at the end of the fight. I myself thought it was a justified action since this could be the lesson for Superman to learn. Then the &#34;I'm sorry sir, he's just SO hot&#34; dialogue part happens. BOOM! like an airplane crash, I immediately remembered everything of why I hated this film. Thank you so much Mr. Snyder and Groyer!<br /><br />The &#34;S&#34; stands for Scared.<br />I am a huge DC comics nerd and I was hoping this movie was going to return some of that inner teen when I watched marathons of the Justice League from the still perfect DC Animated Universe. I was scared that with Snyder directing, because his 300 and Watchmen approaches were, although true to source material, his execution of it ended up as still meh. I understand that this is not the Superman I grew up with and the movie was striving to be something different. I'm open to revamps or reincarnations, but only when they are done right and it's enjoyable to watch as a whole. What we got was a movie that either pleases fans or non fans but also created a huge negative reception from fans and non fans. Usually you strive to please the most, not cause a huge rift between the two. I have no clue what Snyder's attempt was with direction this movie, but I have to assume that he thinks newer audiences always dig grittier things for heroes that usually aren't. Also we apparently have attention spans of fleas with these camera techniques used. The thing that hurts the most? This movie is now Warner Brothers and Legendary picture's template for the DC cinematic Universe, and that is a serious problem. See, the difference between this and Marvel's approach, was that Iron Man was enjoyable from the start and Robert Downey's acting enthusiasm that charms the audience right from the start! For DC, I'm scared of whatthe next set of movies are going to be like if this is what they base it off of.<br /><br />I have to point out one final issue: Why was it called &#34;Man of Steel?&#34; Was it because it's a Superman movie and the title pertains to one of his many comic identities? At least in The Dark Knight we received Jim Gordon's message for the climax of the film to help personify why Batman is called this, or you know, they say the freaking title and it meant something! In this movie, we get nothing! I'm assuming it's titled that because Kal-El crashed through tons of steel then. I don't know, you tell me!<br /><br />Well, for now, this &#34;S&#34; definitely stands for SUCKS.tertained.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great characters, fun plot. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. And just the right amount of sarcastic humor to ensure you don't take it too seriously.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|For a free app., it sure is terrific! A lot of different things one can do with a photo. I would definitely recommend this app.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|No way to view video after taking it with the app.  Seems like a pointless app.  Don't waste your time.
B0053O89JM|5.0|So sorry this series had to end, but the writers and director did a truly fine job of ending it with revealing that even the hardest and most critical of people do have a tender place in their hearts for those they love.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It was the middle of summer - a.k.a Nothing on TV Season - when I saw this was a freebie for Prime members and started watching. I expected to be bored and wander off only wake up several months later on an abandoned merry-go-round with a severe drinking problem and the phone number of a large animal vet scrawled on the palm of my left hand. Instead I was entertained. It was a win-win.
B000035Z3K|5.0|I'm not going to get into the plot, etc., as most of us know the story. What I want to focus on is the dark and brooding tone and atmosphere that this 1931 movie generates. In nostalgic black and white fashion, this movie has very respectable lighting elements and effects to enhance the sense of doom and gloom that is the Dracula story. Furthermore, the acting is adequate to good, and surprisingly not boring. I couldn't help but feel the chill that comes with watching an old and dark horror-based film. I recommend this movie for those who not only appreciate the Dracula novel, but have an open mind to watching a very old film, and perhaps the best movie based on the novel.
B008GJVEZ2|3.0|I want to like this movie and it definitely has it's redeeming qualities, but they are overshadowed by the stiff 'noir-ish' dialogue and stylized representations of characters. Bottom line, it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. A lot of talented people were involved in making this movie and they made a pretty good movie. Not a great one.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book, loved reading it.  Such intense characters.  Still haven't seen the movie but want to soon now that I have all the book details.
B005544V6A|5.0|If you love witty banter, this is the show for you!  Great characters and exciting drama.... it is one of my new favorite shows.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I like anything Bruce Willis is in, lots of action, do not like the R rated parts, takes away from the movie art of it.  Makes any movie lower class.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This one is good, takes you off slow but then gets harder and harder, now that I have played it for a while I really like it, and enjoy playing it, and it keeps my interest.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I thought the book was a great read! I like the fact it's tells a true very good story of how anybody can do what they sat their minds to. I like the fact that he wanted everyone to know that his was a &#34;MAN&#34; or a super hero.  I also liked that he wanted everybody know that he wasn't perfect but with the help of his faith & very hard work he made it.
B007AL48UK|5.0|Really like this one, it gets more complicated as you go, and the challenges get harder. Love this one to keep my mind going and keep me interested in this game.
B0036T1RMM|5.0|For those of you who, like me, thought this movie sounded too strange when it first came out and never got around to seeing it, my advice is, see it immediately!  This movie is daring, and disclaimer, not everything Anderson tried worked, so there are some places that are basically distracting.  Also, several scenes drag on too long, so the movie could have been 30-45 minutes shorter with no loss.  BUT!  it is still one of the most impressive movies I've ever seen.  In this movie, Anderson asks a profound question, and while he gives his own answer pretty clearly, he nonetheless gives the viewer plenty of room to provide his/her own answer(s).  The performances are absolutely topnotch (this is the one movie I actually LIKED Tom Cruise in, and that is saying something indeed), the plotlines are interesting and well-developed, the cinematography is interesting without taking over ... the elements all work together.  At the end of the movie I felt simultaneously satisfied and wanting more -- a great way to end a movie.
B001JI8IJW|5.0|I have to say that I love it even tho I have not watched it yet, this is because I love everything with Brad Pitt, and I love Amazon
B005HEPS6A|5.0|The first 2 episodes are an excellent probe into the complex character of Jean Luc Picard.  Skip anything to do with Luxana Troi.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching this move - now twice.  Very little filthy language and no inappropriate sexual situations.  There is a lot of scary scenes which will probably be too much for younger children.  I think the actors did a great job and I loved the funny parts as well.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|After 3 days trying to return this device, I have had 3 e-mails they are consulting their own staff about my return. This device did not work with my Apple Airport Express and the troubleshooting guide was zero help. Only after I decided to return the item, did I actually get a PHONE number to call for help from Google. Too late for me, I'm moving on to Apple TV. Still waiting on how to return this for a refund.I sure wished I had bought this through Amazon, as this review would have never happened. Beware of returning the Chromecast. Followed their instructions to the letter, no refund twenty days after it was received at their Fremont, ca location,  no response to any e- mails. RIP OFF
B005IQ16M2|4.0|I really enjoyed this read -- I'm a growing fan of Agatha Christie! -- but unfortunately, although this edition is supposedly &#34;illustrated&#34; the major problems listed by other reviewers remain. The illustrations are about a postage stamp size and I was unable to enlarge them, and thus gain the information contained by the illustrations. Although this did not significantly detract from my overall enchantment with the story, it was a bit of a disappointment.
B004ZN9RWK|3.0|no plastic case cover. it make cover easy broken,better provide plastic cover. Recording very good, cheaps price. enough. I love pink floyd.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Works as promised.<br />For an order on items as simple as this, it's hard to give a more detailed review.<br />This is especially true when the items are delivered as promised.<br /><br />Now if they screwed up the order, I'm sure that I could go on and on and on.<br /><br />THAT DID NOT HAPPEN!<br /><br />Please don't ask for reviews that are 25 words (or whatever your stupid rule is) on some thing this simple.
B004ZNB12O|3.0|no plastic case cover. it make cover easy broken,better provide plastic cover. Recording very good, cheaps price. enough. I love pink floyd.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like having my notes on all different places (all the noted sync on my kindle fire, android phone and computer). Sometimes there are conflicting notes when changes are made but the original didn't sync,but that is usually easily correctable. I wish there was a password protected area for passwords, so that the passwords cannot be  easily accessed. I do not want to save super important passwords, just passwords for assorted websites. I will definitely continue using this app and recommending it to others.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|it will not download at all. I keep trying and it wont work. ever.  it will not download at all. I keep trying and it wont work. ever.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This movie is action packed! I would recommend watching the Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America and at least one Iron Man so that you can get the back stories that they make reference to throughout the movie. As in all Marvel or superhero movies, there's always some kind of villain that wreaks havoc and the good guys come to save the day. Overall, it's a fun and very entertaining movie to watch!
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|An under rated action film. Added some heart, soul and thought into the action film genre. Reminiscent of The Professional. Very well done. Very well acted.
B00ERP55NQ|5.0|Great app.  Let's you navigate like google earth.  Has street view where you can follow streets simply by using the directional arrows on the streets.  At intersections, multiple arrows appear which allows you to branch to other streets.
6305428042|5.0|This is the best halloween movie! I have watched it every year since I was a kid. I would recommend this for a family movie night
B00DJLLO0M|2.0|Oh dear , oh dear . I , like many , loved the first 2 Blackfield albums . The Welcome to my DNA was a very mixed bag . Took a while to grow on me but finally was acceptable but nothing exceptional . And now #4 . First of all , it clocks in at a very disappointing 31 minutes only . Who makes 30 minute albums these days ?<br />As for the content ?<br />Oh dear , oh dear ....... oh dear .<br />Incredibly dull . All very well orchestrated and pleasant enough but not a standout track at all in the 30 minutes . Even Steven Wilsons presence on track 7 \\"Jupiter\\" can't save it from being sub standard .<br />Musically , as i said , its pleasant and even slightly \\"Beatlesque \\" , but there really is nothing here to make you prick up your ears . Half finished ideas for songs ?  Starter riffs that could have gone somewhere but don't . Take \\"Lost Souls\\" . Theres a good melody line leading to a potential chorus that ..... just ... goes .... nowhere . Wasted .<br />The 30 minutes passed by and even playing it again ..... and again ...... still felt like \\"mall\\" music .<br />Sorry Avi , i really wanted this to be a great album .<br />But its kind of like a Chicken Korma . Bland , harmless and all in all pleasant but no spice , kick or zing to it .<br />Save your dollars .
B007AFBYYY|5.0|I've loved this movie since I first saw it in the theatre. Michael Bien is wonderful in it. Anyone who has a good or best friend, as in this film, will get the true meaning of it. I looked for K2 for a few years and could never find it. Thanks to Amazon it is still available.<br />The film has a lot of action and adventure in it but it really speaks to the heart. It shows how one person can change and make a huge difference in another's life. If you haven't seen it you'll be touched and thrilled at the same time. If you have seen it you should add it to your collection. It's inexpensive in the full screen version and more expensive in wide screen but no matter how much it costs I think it's priceless!
B00CO4CVN4|4.0|Some of the exercises are very good for learning. At first it looks boring, but eventually the effort pays off.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Down loaded to my iPad , I love this show! My husband started watching while on the road. I had to order to catch up!!
0316044695|5.0|A very well written book!!! The \\"realism\\" is vivid throughout the dialogue. Marcus bares his soul in this book.  If anyone can read it without some tears of gratitude for him and ALL the men and women who volunteer to protect our way of life I feel sorry for them!!!<br />Why Marcus, Mikey, Axe and Danny did not receive Congressional Medal of Honor awards is beyond me!!!<br />Marcus, Thank you for having the \\"fire\\" to let us all know what it is really like to be \\"ONE HELL OF AN AMARICAN HERO!!!!  THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU and ALL your SEAL family/buddies!!!!!
B00E6Z0THE|1.0|I bought this game and for some reason it refuses to download to my kindle. Hope I can get it to sometime. So disappointed.!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The show is skipping years between episodes, yet the characters don't age.  Afraid they are going to be in present times by end of season 4!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It is so much fun to play. No complaints at all. I defiantly recommend it to anyone.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Okay, this headset is pretty much the best thing since the microwave. The wireless feature is reliable and surprisingly high quality. I can walk around my entire house and this thing still outputs sound. Beautiful sound I might add. It isn't the best 7.1 surround I have ever heard, but it is pretty close. For the price you can't complain. Next the comfort level of this piece is absolutely mind blowing or should I say mind cuddling? Yeah this thing cradles your head instead of squeezing the life out of it. Also the adjustment works a lot better than that of the G35 that some of you may have struggled with before. The microphone is high quality and holds it's place without too much trouble. Also, you have to love those programmable G keys and that volume wheel. My one complaint actually isn't with the physical product itself but with the software. With the current update, because of the audio level restrictions in the EU the user cannot customize the pre-amp. I would prefer if Logitech would release an American version of the software that allowed us equalizer junkies full customization. Other than that though, it's a great purchase that will not disappoint.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|When i first saw this game i thought it was lame like some others. But not at all.. i stared playing it and i get in love with the game. Is fun andeasy to play. You can create a wonderful village, but is not a village is like a zoo paradise and also you can learn lots of thighs.. You get to expand your imagination :)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Just loved this series so much -- charming, loving story set in the end of 1800s in rural UK.  Young girl goes to become a postal worker in her aunt's shop and the wealth of customers and friends she makes along with her small hamlet's inhabitants makes a rich tapestry on which to draw.  GREAT entertainment for the entire family!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  A tale told with warmth,as well as sorrow. The storyline tied together in a bittersweet ending that was touching and made me sorry the story ended.
B009NI46F0|5.0|This movie is touching, well made, and unless you must be married to a Vanderbilt, it will make you feel good all over.
B0000AM6IY|2.0|Wouldn't recommend this product. Our copy had fuzzy audio and a clicking noise that ran through the entire movie. Good movie, though.
B008LXZEYU|2.0|It would be great, Will, if you spent just a little longer writing the script, develop the plot and make the situations truly funny. You didn't and it shows.<br />Seems like Will is counting on the same people laughing from the same jokes because he speaks them. Sorry - we need a bit more than that.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|Anything with Savannah as the place for a mystery/ suspense story is going to be well received since I think that city has so much &#34;under the covers&#34; going on! A fun read with lots of unexpected turns that keep you interested and paying attention. Well written and enjoyable. Hope there will be more interesting &#34;action&#34; going on in Savannah from this author!
B001JIES4Q|5.0|It started with me wanting to take one for the team and give my wife a nice evening by watching one of 'her' movies. Was I ever wrong. Chills from start to finish, as the movie follows several separate yet interlocked plots. You will cry, you will laugh, and you will get a lot of wife-points! :-)
075669812X|5.0|My 6 year old absolutely loves Legos and loves to read. I really didnt want to spend so much money on a book but amazon was cheaper than in store. And we made a deal if my son read through another book he could get this one! I like it because he learns about weapons, expands his vocab and is using his imagination! If this is what keeps him interested in reading and learning, I'm all about it!
B00D8OHPF8|4.0|I like this CD due to the vocals of Joe, crisp, clear and very harmonic.  The CD has some true R&B tracks!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Pretty cool good for Xblive stuff good guns for WaW and pretty good looking too More pistols would he nice
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent - my husband and i cant wait for season 2.<br />We highly recommend it.  This is quality programming.  Love the opulence of the Abby- the period clothing and hairstyles are beautiful.  Casting perfect.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I get very caught up in the characters, and have a love of all things English. Terrific show. Glad to have it.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|nice CD arrived in record time.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Color me skeptical when THE BOURNE LEGACY was released.  I loved this paranoid, action-packed franchise with Matt Damon leading the madness and mayhem.  So I knew this installment had its work cut out for me to enjoy it, and now that I've seen THE BOURNE LEGACY several times, I truly believe it's the best of the bunch.  Jeremy Renner brings even more energy to the lead role, Agent Aaron Cross, and I never knew I would so enjoy a sneering Edward Norton as the CIA cover-up specialist determined to bring Cross down.  And to pay homage--if not much-needed continuity for plot purposes--to its predecessors, Scott Glenn, Joan Allen, Albert Finney, and David Strathairn all make brief appearances in character.<br /><br />Aaron Cross is not your typical Jason Bourne--he's Jason Bourne super charged.  The assassin has been genetically enhanced by his government handlers; his strength, agility, and intelligence are superhuman.  Only now, the CIA wants to cover up its tracks, destroy the evidence of Operation Outcome; to do this, every operative in the field must die.  So we have what we've enjoyed in all the Bourne predecessors--a 24/7 high tech chase, with Cross narrowly missing death at every turn.  Plus, he's accompanied by a government doctor who is herself on the Kill List (Rachel Weisz), forcing the two of them to flee to Manila in hopes of getting Cross to \\"viral out.\\"  The climax is a heart-pounding motorcycle chase along the streets, alleys, and sidewalks of Manila--a chase that dares you not to be hanging on to your chair.  And finally, the ending to THE BOURNE LEGACY is what I enjoyed most of all.  It's open-ended, meaning another installment is on its white knuckle way.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B000002KET|5.0|good cd
B00EE3FVSU|3.0|Too many people seem to be acting &#34;out of character.&#34;  I'm sure we the audience will be let in on their secrets eventually, but for now its a distraction.
B000002KE2|5.0|good cd
B00177YA1K|5.0|Recommend this to anyone who loves Will Smith! Had to have it for my collection. Great buy! Very funny movie
B0041T7FS6|5.0|Loved the rare tracks and remixes. I look forward to more. The Johnny Mathis  songs were very interesting to hear.
B0000AMJED|4.0|I love these movies! Had to get it for the collection. I'm a fast and furious fan, I love all the movies.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I read this book within 4 days, which is a real accomplishment for me. The book was very interesting in the way it looked at time and how people view it. I wanted to know more about the two main characters because the author went back and forth between their stories (it kept me entertained). Overall, the book was serious but not depressing, just a fun short read. I would defiantly recommend this book.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I can't believe there was only one season! There is also a movie with the same cast/storyline, &#34;Serenity&#34; if you enjoy the series.<br /><br />Fun characters and situations, an interesting mix of high and low tech &#34;worlds&#34; and a lot of suspense, great art direction and look. I just loved everything about it.
B004WO57E4|5.0|The delivery was in time and without problems. The quality of the collection is good and the price is very good. I think that every fan of the Heroes of Might and Magic series will be happy to own this collection.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game, keeps me busy when the football is on!!! The levels with the touch are really hard though.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|An excellent story, quite different than the movie. I like each in their own right. Now to read book two of the series
B00AHRWBH6|5.0|This book should be considered the bible of life.  These chapters should be read and reread.  Book like that should always be near for inspiration and motivation.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just finished reading this book for the second time and I still couldn't put it down! The book catches you and pulls you in with the surprises and intensity. Excellent read!!
B002SEW5WW|4.0|Purchased the cd for \\"Good Life,\\" but didn't realize the curse words on it.  It should have been Amazon should have mentioned this information.  Had been hearing the song on Disney commercials, etc.  Just wished there was an alternative to this version.  I have heard One Republic perform this song on TV and they didn't use the curse words.  Besides that, I simply love this cd.  This was my first purchase of theirs and since I don't really listen to the radio, I will probably chance purchasing other cds by this group.
B00BU18U82|5.0|this game is the best game I have ever played my little sister loves is and so do I the game is awesome!!!!!!
B00CDCLL1A|5.0|Very trippy and moving.  I loved it because of the complexity of the plot and the meaning behind it all.  It belongs up there with some of the best.
1452115567|5.0|👏👏👏💗 So amazing! Just what I wanted it to be. Beautiful pictures and clever photo skills. Highly recommended. 😊👍 Awesome
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|I am so addicted to this show...Just last week I turned on reruns and got 3 non watchers to hop on board...They love it and are now speed watching to get ready for season 3 premiere!!!!!!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love this game!! Easy to read and understand...<br />GREAT for MEMORY!!!!  Even my grandkids and play, it also.provides a challenge each time you play.
B002VWNID6|5.0|A fun movie - it alters historical chronology just a bit; but who among us really cares about English history anyway.
B0001MLMKY|1.0|I purchased the watch expecting to save from what I normally pay at the store, but the watch was defective. Date and day of the week did not work properly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Honestly I thought it would just be a bad clone of subway surfers with Disney characters. Boy was I wrong! I actually play this more than anything else! Highly recommended
034580404X|5.0|Loved these books
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this series, but in watching it I realized how good it was.  Not a ton of fighting the aliens, it's more about the tenacity of humans to survive.<br /><br />Can't wait to dive into season 2!
1416596585|5.0|Besides my own business reasons for wanting to know as much as I can about Google, I think Google's now so central to learning that the more I understand it, the better I'll learn. Marshall McLuhan was right: the medium is the message.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My son loves this game. He really likes the idea that he gets to create in this game. He is a thinker and this reaaly keeps him occupied . Kuddos Nemo!
B003MYYJD0|5.0|cold not fathom  the size and weight off this watch, just stunning all round, so many compliments,also purchased the speedway for my father he loves it. and the Russian  divers for my second watch.have not received it yet cant wait.
B001AW156U|1.0|I ordered THREE pairs of these triggers thinking that they were the ones pictured. Unfortunately, they turned out completely different. The Pelican/PDP triggers that are pictured come in a box and are smooth and comfortable. The triggers that I received are cheap, uncomfortable, and do not fit the controller right. It's a shame that I can't return them without losing more money. If you can find the Actual PDP trigger attachments, I highly recommend those. Do not waste your money here.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but it was terrible. I probably should have been stoned while viewing it, because it did have nice colors ...
B0042JSMV4|5.0|My head is still swimming with all the borders and patterns! The descriptions and charts make even the most 'advanced' patterns clear and easy to understand.  There is at least a couple borders for everything I will crochet for the rest of my life.
B00985E3UG|5.0|long overdue review of what these giant food companies do to us and our chidren - every family ought to read this aroound the dinne table - turn off the TV - yur health depends on it!  Wish i had read it long ago!
B001RJTFP4|5.0|Very entertaning and the actors hold your attention all the way through. I hope they continue to make more now that Wesley is available .
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and have receommended it to other people. It's an unusual story, and the photographs really work with the plot.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Book aptly and simply explains the science behind nutrition and how the foods we eat effect our bodies and health. I highly recommend.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. Great ensemble cast, good plot. I have already recommended this to others. Maggie Smith is a pleasure to watch.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Great addition to keep kids busy will on the move.  Easy for little hands. Kept my grandchild busy while without all the questions.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|The acting was good but the story kept me waiting for something interesting to happen.  I found the story to be just another 'boys on the river' tale.  Predictable formula.  My wife suspects that the positive reviews are based on women enjoying McConaughey's shirtless scenes.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Got this little tool from amazon. shipping took couple of weeks. well worth the time.<br /><br />this device is amazing. from one side it operates like roku, apple tv, etc. it is a streaming device.<br /><br />amazing thing about this little gadget is that you can stream from your laptop chrome browser straight to your hdtv.<br /><br />roku and other devices only allow you to use one of their apps to stream.<br /><br />this device allows you to stream anything using either neflix and other supported apps or google chrome web browser via available plugin.<br /><br />i download movies from the web and open them with chrome web browser and cast this video to my hdtv.<br /><br />Amazing!
B00BIVN82M|3.0|I love Michael Buble and have every one of his CD's.  Sad to say this latest was one is somewhat disappointing.  I don't care for most of the song choices.  Michael should stick to what he does best--the standards!
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|It took forever to read because it kept going over the same thing over and over and over.I would not get another book by this auther.
B0057GUE3K|4.0|The movie was great and am very happy to have a copy. The combo Blu ray + DVD is nice.<br />This movie shows what low budget talented independent film makers can do. Very intense dense plot with twists pulling attention. Would have gave 5 stars but the Blu ray copy is defective. Skipping seriously at the beginning locker scene as he walks to it. I don't mind though. All my other Blu ray titles pay flawlessly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game its fun and very kaotic,. Its a blast Its a fun game . Its woth it. Buy it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so much fun.... I'm addicted to it. I love bingo in general but this one is amazing.
B006XF5BTG|3.0|Nothing revolutionary in this, just a good review of how a program of low reps/heavy weight/large muscle group concentration can stimulate muscle growth.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This was such a great movie and worthy of its Oscar. There were glitches - nothing is perfect e.g. jet wash anyone - a small point missed in the final escape scene. I guess you need a Bond movie budget like &#34;Casino Royale&#34; later Miami Airport scenes to get that right. Nonetheless, Ben Affleck at his best with a lesser known cast all convincing in their roles. Ben just keeps getting better as a Director too.
B005I7G3EM|3.0|Great musical score by Mancini and beautiful location filming with some decent action sequences, but unimaginative dialogue, uninspired acting and a plot that goes nowhere.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Great album!  Love the country-pop sound to this work of art.  Have been a fan since I first heard Carrie on American Idol.
B004QYTRRS|5.0|If you like watching Angelina Jolie dressed to the &#34;9s&#34; through the entire movie, this is the movie for you.  She doesn't touch a gun, ride a motorcycle, or kick the crap out of anyone yet she keeps you interested.  I thought Her and Johnny Depp were quite good together in this movie.  This was a must purchase for me.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks has completely changed the game on how apocalypse novels are written.  He writes this from a point of view of a future UN official, after the world has been changed by the zombie wars.  He interviews many people around the world to capture their perspective on what had happened.  He has done his research diligently into many facets of society.  I would encourage anyone who is into sci-fi to pick up this gem of a book.  You won't be sorry that you did.
B00406O7YK|4.0|This movie is a great classic.  The music is fantastic and HD really makes viewing a treat.  I would recommend this movie for a night when your wife can't stand another &#34;Action/Thriller&#34; or a &#34;SciFi&#34;.  Just be prepared to try and keep up with Barbra and her rapid fire words
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Excellent book.  Caught my interest right away and made for a quick read.  The characters were well developed and believable.  I may propose this as a pick for my book club group as it has plenty in it for discussion.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved all 13 books. The author ended it without leaving things unanswered and happy as well. Yes I am a sucker for happy endings.
B00B3N4CWK|5.0|Excellent acting.  Deals with thought provoking topics.  Makes me want to read the book.  The characters are well developed and likable yet flawed which makes them interesting and believable.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Great movie, good acting, great sound track what more can you ask for ??? R.I.P Whitney Houston you are missed!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Well you know already, i love tht game, opens up the mind, and allows yu to think quickly on the spot
B00E193TM2|4.0|I'll have to say, I've seen and heard of FFDP for awhile now and have not even attempted to listen to them. I arrogantly thought too commercial (I've been into the underground Metal & Hardcore scene since 1982) I saw this album on sale for $2.99 & thought what the hell I'll check it out. I'm glad I did, I see the broader commercial appeal and at the same time some great Brutality, Hate & Pain (everything that is REAL Metal). Now I need to check out their older stuff.
B003730LRY|4.0|Have not seen this for a while and it was funny watching it again. Good movie! Funny and very entertaining. If only the Family Reunion one was on Prime as well!!
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Love this show,  this is how a Sci-fi  show should be  made, great chemistry with the cast,  great effects,  good story.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Wonderful story, fantastic acting, fabulous setting. Mr Hoffman established himself as a premier director. I've now seen it 4 times, and loved it more each time. My 95 year old friend, who I gave a copy to, watches it at least once a week. She's in a nursing home, and in a great deal of pain due to a leg problem, and this takes her mind off her problems. As a former actress, she can be very critical, but not about this. She absolutely adores it.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|A must for all entrepeneurs and good text book for buisness students. Lots of good insights can be obtained from this book
B004NCLKJG|5.0|This live broadcast is absolute perfection. Five spectacular performances led by the incomparable, irreplaceable Birgit Nilsson. Everyone brings their &#34;A&#34; game. The intensity and attention to every note and detail are thrilling. It's a must for every Wagner lover.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I thought this was very reasonable for the 8 film series. I love harry potter and I am enjoying my DVDs!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Some favorites will move on .. but really well acted and well scripted. Worth the watch! so watch it! :)
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Found myself guffawing more than once too! Takes the sci-fi themes of Area 51 and martians have landed and puts a very human twist on it.
B005544TRQ|4.0|What a really good series. Good premise, good writing, cast, shooting,cutting. Could really do without the profanity and the 3 or 4 gratuitous GD's per episode.<br />Series has legs from what I've seen so far. Love interest needed for managing partner, outside the firm of course.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Another great novel from Patricia.  Really enjoyed it.  Am reading Scarpetta right now.  Am almost done with that one, too.  Next one will be Dust.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|If you are looking for a garden variety, chicken-soup-for-the-Christian-soul, book about Jesus this is not it.  However, if you want to learn about the socio/economic and political climate of Israel during Jesus day, including other would be messiah's and zealots, this is an excellent start.  Reza Aslan is a good writer and puts high level  NT scholarship on the bottom shelf.  No doubt, many Christians will not like Reza's conclusions. I think that only serves to prove his point.  The Jesus of the church is not the Jesus of history. The Jesus of history has more contemporary significance, the Jesus of the church serves the Western status quo.  I don't agree fully, but I do agree enough to recommend you read it and talk about it and wrestle with it.<br /><br />I also appreciated his take on the relationship between James (Jesus' brother), Peter and Paul in the early church.  He spurred me on to deeper study of the issues he raises - especially concerning Paul's relationship to the Jerusalem church.
B000W8HC8I|2.0|There was just too much bad language and drugs.  The attempts the author made at humor were inappropriate and failed miserably.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book that is why I gave it a 5 star but I am not going to buy the other two in the series because it does not end.  I would have to buy one,two or how many more to see how it ends. At $8.00 to $10.00 plus tax a book it is to much.  When it is called a novel I expect it to have a ending.  So Ms.Day from now on when you finish this Novel do not let it run on an on, stay with one book
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can we get to season 4 please. Ok - was shocked by the season ending. So many dead bodies!!! Good suspense.
B00C2PO09I|3.0|This movie was unlike any I have ever seen. It was interesting yet a bit slow. It was a creatively told love story.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Thanks for the 2.5 hours of tension. It was an amazing movie depicting the hard work and bravery of members of our military and clandestine services. Thank you!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I could not put the book down, Hosseini continues to capture my attention in a uniquely, talented way, loved it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!  Can't wait to read the next one!  I couldn't put it down, finished it in a couple of days.
B00498YZFK|5.0|This movie illustrates the harsh realities of life for some folks in the Ozarks.  The setting is very near my home.
0152023984|5.0|Nice artwork and binding. And what's NOT good about &#34;The Little Prince&#34;?  The well made book and story work great together.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|Ok, I'm not a superfan. I do think City of Evil is one of the finest metal albums in the last 15 years, and its worth going back and revisiting because it is still superb. The subsequent self titled album and Nightmare, for me, left me disappointed. So here they are again, with \\"Hail to the King\\". Right off the bat it feels like an homage to the 90s metal releases from Metallica's Black Album, and Megadeth's Countdown and Youthanasia (listen to \\"Reckoning Day\\" by Megadeth, then listen to the drums on track 1, geez). This isn't a perfect album by any stretch. I like when A7X breaks down into the crazy and sprawls around inside their own song structures. There's none of that here. All the songs are finely tuned and tightly crafted. Some are forgettable (This Means War is underwhelming) but many are worthy of pushing repeat (Heretic, Coming Home). It's obvious they pushed themselves to trim the fat and make as solid of an album as possible. For me it's their next best after City of Evil.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|This is an engaging, well-acted and exceedingly clever film. I highly recommend it (and really, when else are you going to find Batman, Alfred, Wolverine, Ziggy Stardust and Black Widow all in one place?).
B0089MXRII|5.0|This book is beautifully written and a wonderful insight into every day Russian life.<br />The stories are written one for every month of the year and each is introduced with a little background information from the author.<br />The stories follow the lives of a traditional Russian family and are told from the perspective of the young daughter. They give the reader a real feel of what it was like to grow up in Russia in the 1990s and draw on contrasts from earlier decades illustrating how life had changed for Russian people.<br />If you wish to learn about Russian life and traditions in a light and entertaining way then this collection of stories is definitely the book for you.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|We didn't know much about District 9 when we purchased the movie. We only remebered thst the previews made us put it on our list. About 30 or 40 minutes into the film I was disappointed. We took a break and the hubby and I talked about how slow and dull it was. Still, we went back in to finish the film and we're sure glad we did! Suddenly things started to fit together and, as they say - it just got interesting. There are great twists that I didn't see coming. Love it when that happens. I'll love it even more if/when the story is continued.
B004QMRHHW|5.0|I just got into these guys. I bought &#34;Deceiver of the gods&#34; to get myself ready for Mayhem Festival. They kicked ass live and after buying &#34;Surtur Rising&#34;. I'm totally committed! Definitely a band worth checking out!
B003M6FGTE|5.0|This show has been a lot of fun to watch and catch up on! I had never seen it before and now I am hooked!
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|not for nothing, but it appears to be nothing more than a glorified sync program to me. perhaps i overlooked something that might make it useful for my purposes, but i don't think so. it might have appeal for some users, but it's not what i hoped it would be.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The show keeps getting even more interesting and fun to watch with full of surprises and unexpected situations. Highly recommended!!!
B00B9366VO|4.0|A fun look into the studio process and the making of many great records! I enjoyed this move a lot!
B00B9366VO|5.0|I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but it was done very well. It was fun to learn about some music history and how an unknown whole in the wall studio was part of recording so many top albums and bands.
B004RCUJ9E|3.0|Just a plain old checkers game.  If you like checkers this is for you.  You can sit on your porch or up at the filling station and play this with your 65+year old retired friends......
B007ZXK08C|4.0|If the measure of a novel is how well you might remember it, say, five years from now ... Then Gone Girl will earn high stars from me for that reason alone.<br /><br /> The tale of true love trailing off into nothingness under the strain of real life and serial  disappointment, is eloquently told by Gillian Flynn. This is not your average thriller and the first person voice used to allow the reader into the strange world the protagonists make for themselves is a very effective story telling tool. Nick and Amy are utterly believable, they embark on romance with determination, creating for the audience a magic world so intriguing that it becomes increasingly difficult, with the flick of each page, to put the book down. I was riveted from the start.<br /><br />When the mystery begins, it is a suspenseful thing with a mind of its own, and you the reader, will want to get inside that mind. The whodunit aspect is smartly handled and I doubt that there are many who will guess in advance, not that, that is the premise for the book. Indeed, we are allowed into the secret well before the story has run its course. This is a work about a twisted personality, a one off, an unfathomable lunatic. That said, the controversial elements inherent in the plot that have riled the feathers of many good feminists, are not, in my humble opinion, worthy of ballooning--this is a tale about a special type of crazy, rather than gender-stereotype-crazy. I do not want to spoil the story for the reader, so I'll leave this aspect there. The plot is very sharp; the author has woven 'cunning, clever and quirky'  thickly through every tiny strand of the tale. Be prepared for an unusual and wickedly entertaining story that might leave you chilled to the bone.
B00CEK9OTM|2.0|I liked the concept but i usually try and relax when playing this game.  Dont think you will be able to recline unless you put the game in touch control mode.  You have to sit up straight and keep the tablet flat and tilt it around to make the ball roll.  Just ok.....
B001KT6JPA|5.0|As I said in the title Sir Anthony Hopkins is the best actor to make this portrayal.  His acting is wonderful.  The character itself \\"Hannibal\\" is taken from a variety of serial killers and Anthony does a superb job in the role.  My only criticism is that Jodi Foster decided not to be in the movie as Agent Starling again.  It would have been an Academy Award Winner again if she had.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|You will get cramps and calused with this one or rub grooves in the glass from so much tapping.  You can play dress-up if your into that sort of thing.....

B008ALA6DW|1.0|tell me one reason why should we even rate at 5 stars rewards good ratings to apple decisions. i bought a macbook pro with retina display which was $3,500 and i get no adapters? what is that? the adapter is overpriced and should be cheaper for the only thing it does is to generate an output created around the 90's is a technology that you find for a dollar and they sell it for $30? wow apple is greedy i learned my lesson next time building a windows pc.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that tree is so much carnage<br />Described in great detail, and it tells of disgusting mutilation, other than that the book is probably is good summer read to read in the DAYTIME, if you readily late at night you risk horrible dreams. like I did.

B0062QRTKA|5.0|What a fun game.  I thought it was a bit offensive at first, but then I saw how cute it was.  Fun!
0893860468|5.0|I have read many spiritual books. This one is a must own. Eckhart Tolle, Krishnamurti, Lao Tzu  are my top three authors of self dissolving books; Nisargadatta is tied with them. Each author brings his own great style and they all compliment one another. This book deserves more ratings because it has a great uniqueness and gives me a greater sense of how to reach the supreme. The passages stick with me and make me desire non-desire and yearn for the truth like no other. This teacher makes me feel that I can 'obtain' the unobtainable and knowing his origins, a relatively simple shop owner, shows us that it's not for just sages who are extraordinarily good at meditation or yoga...it's for everyone who want's nothing else; which, if you understand the cyclical nature of pleasure and pain (experience and suffering often serve as better teachers than just the knowledge) then this inward path to realization is all that matters. His teachings make me believe that I too can shed my identity and live in bliss; no desires or fears clouding my mind and leading me into suffering. Each passage is absolutely brilliant and has helped me clear up so much of my questions, deep regret and doubt and replaced it with gratitude, faith and resolve. The book makes me more 'earnest', a word he uses quite often, suggesting that earnestness and integrity will get you over the river. Please read this book and perhaps save yourself some turmoil; I know if I had read and digested this book before I had left the path to enlightenment in order to pursue desire, ending up in a hellish nightmare for several years, I might have not had to endure such a self betrayal. However I know all the suffering was a most divine teacher and am now grateful for reminding me why it is I'm here.<br /><br />Blessings,<br /><br />Michael
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Full of great dialog and terrific acting, this series is thoroughly entertaining. Just the right balance between the law and personal relationships. Looking forward to season 3!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is really good sd fun. it is kind of like taking care of an actual horse and other peoples horses. I would definetly recommend this app for everyone of any age.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Dr. Taleb discovers the roots of fragility. Unfortunately, there is a lot of &#34;score-settling&#34; in this book that distracts from the main point. Nevertheless, this is an important work.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|its exactly what i figured this book would be and then some.  Highly Recommended for any fan of any Sherlock.
B009AY04A8|4.0|It's nice to play a hidden object game that tries to mix up the gameplay by having you search by name by shape and by pairs with a few word jumbles thrown in and all tied together with a decent storyline.  There are a few problems though like spelling errors (die vs dice) making it less clear exactly what you are looking for.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|The Coen brothers said that O' Brother, Where Art Thou? was loosely based on Homer's Odyssey. They delivered the goods. It's loosely but not that loosely based upon that ancient tale. O' Brother improved upon the Odyssey for one thing: it has a great soundtrack, which isn't surprising as Homer was not noted for his singing. If you like traditional southern music, it is a delight. Applause for the Coens, once again. They are two of the few in Hollywood to make movies worth seeing.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|I use Waze on all my trips now.  It has saved me a lot of time by suggesting alternate routes to avoid traffic backups.  It helps avoid boredom on the road.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I'm not one for a lengthy description, so I'll say this:  The show is great.  Acting is spot on and natural.  Both starring and supporting characters are compelling and have depth that leaves you wanting to know more about them.  And the plot lines are interesting and almost have a mystery element to them to see how the characters will pull it off in the end.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Very entertaining, especially for kids.  You can do most of his functions for free.  Have to pay to do reactions in the lab...kind of lame.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|best movie i have seen in a long time. sad, beautiful, touching, historical, with great acting and direction. an epic film.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Hidden object game interface is okay.  Allows zoom into the picture which is nice, but it interprets your zoom motion as a picking an item and it penalizes you for it.  Also the storyline dialogue is confusing and boring.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|slightly predictable, but one of the better YA series.  Like the strong female lead driven by something other than a boy
B00BRUYQFC|3.0|usually love JT, but I'm a bit let down with this album.  It's just not as fun as I expected
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This is a great sequel.  Each character is coming alive.  The actors have made the last 2 movies fun and exciting.  I am recommending this movie to everybody.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The action is unstoppable...the premise believable somehow...and you feel as if you're surviving right with the characters who are left.  No one is safe, and that's truly scary!
B008Q09K2U|4.0|not as good as the other Corey / Brenner books, but I still enjoyed it. I love the political incorrectness of these books, when is the next one coming?<br />,
0345472322|5.0|This is an outstanding book that offers a powerful model  of how to think about learning and growing.  Your beliefs about the human qualities of intelligence, social skills, likability, adaptability, etc., will determine how you evaluate situations and then respond to those situations.<br /><br />If you believe that these qualities are fixed, like traits, you will develop a personal style that guards and protects this precious quantity while secretly worrying that you might have not been given enough of this endowment to make you above average, special. Conversely, believing that people are given different endowments at birth but with effort, practice, and diligence you can accomplish goals that initially seemed impossible by growing and developing your capabilities you are not deterred by a fear of failure.<br /><br />The central idea is this: are you a 'learner' - someone who thrives and looks for challenges believing that over time difficult situations become easier and that not following your dreams because you're afraid you might fail is the most unfortunate choice a person can make in their life or are you a 'non-learner'  - someone who seeks success & validation, feels good when praised and preoccupied with being competent but secretly wishing you would take a big risk, accept a new challenge, or embrace going in a new direction with your life.<br /><br />If this seems interesting to you please get this book. It's worth your time to see if this book can help you.<br /><br />Authors must confront the challenge of deciding which audience they wish to address with their book.  With this book, Mindset, the author has a long and established academic career so she is attempting to present her ideas to a more general audience.<br /><br />If you think the book lacks a more academic treatment of the subject a simple search on Google scholar will provide many academic articles with a more systemic approach to the subject. You don't become a tenured Prof. at Columbia and then Stanford unless you are a prolific publisher of novel research in top journals.<br /><br />The book does often repeat ideas that were already addressed earlier in the book.  This is instructive and necessary. The main idea of the book seems straight forward but it is subtly complex.<br /><br />Reintroducing the ideas allows the reader to get the finer details in different settings. While the model might seem simple and the description of the two mindsets easy to understand it is considerably more complicated and some may wish to resist seeing themselves as different that who they think they really are.  This offers the reader many examples in different settings so that a clearer understanding can develop.<br /><br />Also, change is hard. You are literally rewiring your brain. You are consciously avoiding indulging old thought patterns to forge new neuronal connections. The old patterns will not disappear, you create the option of choosing a different path which will become more ingrained with greater use.  It is encouraging to read about others who have made significant changes in their life.<br /><br />Even if you find that you have a growth mindset you are likely to still have some fixed tendencies and you will surely have to deal with others that have fixed mindsets so this book is for everyone.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I've had several carbide sharpeners, but thought I'd try this smaller one. Using the carbides, there is a distinct burr rolled over on one side of the blade. I turn it around to even it out, but not very effective. The ceramic gets it fairly sharp, but nowhere near how I thought it would be. The saving grace is the rod I can use on my serrated blades and a gut hook skinner. I'm not gonna throw it away, but I'll stick with my Arkansas stones for now.

082221539X|5.0|I would suggest that it also be good for a larger stage, but we have a small stage at Theatre29 in the middle of the desert. The play reads well, is flexible for casting and Mr. Linney gives amble stage notes (that I am sure most directors will only read casually). I recommend this version as do three other directors.

B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I like HO games so this was worth playing. However,  I will not spend real $ on this game so it gets a little frustrating waiting for my energy to recharge.  There are also so many facets to each level that it can tend to get a little confusing, as I don't want to have to keep notes on how to play.  There are other games that I have done this for as well as developed strategies for more efficient game play....I just choose not to do that for this game.  With all of that said, if you are just looking to kill a little time here and there, this is a fun game.

B000002LR6|5.0|I could go on and on and on about how amazing this album is, but you've heard it all. Not just Ministry's greatest album, but the best album in the history of the entire genre of industrial.  Still amazing and not outdated all these years later like their peers of the time (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax,etc.), this album is still faster and harder than anything coming out today.  Sure, you have bands playing faster per se, but not with the precision and able to write memorable songs.  Go read Uncle Al's new book.. it's amazing as well!  Long live Ministry!

B00CPWTRAA|3.0|I can only offer an appendix to the lead reviewer's knowledgeable and just remarks. Domingo is capping his career with a double achievement, singing at a very advanced age and conquering an entirely new vocal range. I celebrated his highly publicized entry into the baritone role of Simon Boccanegra, where his intensity and poignancy carried the day. But Domingo has to pass a difficult test in this program of twice-familiar Verdi arias. If you close your eyes and listen purely to the voice, setting aside that it belongs to a world-famous singer, would the singing on this CD really succeed?<br /><br />The answer, judged purely as vocalism, must sadly be no, for the simple reason that we aren't hearing a Verdi baritone in weight, timbre, and force. It's amazing that Domingo can encompass Rigoletto's range, for example, but he sounds wrong, like a tenor, in fact. What there is to enjoy is Domingo's passionate attack and his personality, which are undiminished. The example of Ramon Vinay, a famous Wagner tenor in the postwar years who later moved down to baritone roles, is different. He had a bigger, more baritonal voice to begin with, and much more visceral impact than Domingo, as either tenor or baritone.<br /><br />Even so, I bow to Domingo because he can pull this demanding program off at all. On stage his added presence would cover up the vocal deficits that come with age, particularly a wide all-but-wobble on sustained notes. For me, the most treasurable memento form his late phase is a miraculously daring and fresh DG recording from 2010 of Leoncavallo's little known song cycle with orchestra, La nuit de mai (verismo music set to a French text). As for this program, I found it best to approach it as a tenor singing, in tenorish fashion, some great music by Verdi. On that basis, his 'Di provenza il mar' is compelling - if anything Domingo sounds too young! - and one imagines that when he sings Germont pere on stage, the audience will go wild. The recorded sound is excellent in its realism, and the ordinary conducting is beside the point.<br /><br />Verdi:<br /><br />Perfidi!...Piet&agrave;, rispetto, amore (from Macbeth)<br /><br />Pari siamo!

B00499NHLC|5.0|as the subject line says - this show is wonderfully fresh, well acted and beautifully shot as if each episode were a film.<br /><br />Well worth watching both 'seasons' and highly anticipating the 3rd season
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|There's little doubt that I'll be playing the best tracks from ANOTHER SELF PORTRAIT for the rest of my days. The question is, why is everyone continuing to swallow the stale Kool Aid of received opinion regarding the original SELF PORTRAIT? ASP isn't Bob Dylan (or Jeff Rosen, more likely) proclaiming, \\"Okay, folks, here's the real deal after that atrocity we foisted on the public 43 years ago!\\" As the title would have it, it's \\"another\\": more of the same.<br /><br />The case being made over and over and again that this is somehow the stripped-down/raw/\\"realer\\" SELF PORTRAIT that should've been released all along is hokum. Yes, there's great traditional stuff on this collection. \\"Railroad Bill,\\" \\"Tattle O'Day,\\" \\"This Evening So Soon\\" \\"House Carpenter\\"...all of that material is choice, even essential Dylan, right up with the best material on GOOD AS I BEEN TO YOU and WORLD GONE WRONG. And the covers of Tom Paxton and Eric Andersen make a persuasive argument that Bob's nods to Gordon Lightfoot and Paul Simon on SELF PORTRAIT were part of a larger scheme, an admission that he was alert to the sounds and styles of his contemporaries. The reworkings of Dylan's own catalogue vary in quality. That's a great \\"Went To See the Gypsy\\" opening Disc One, an unexpected (and delightful) \\"Only a Hobo\\" and a fascinating \\"If Not For You.\\" But though I'm happy to hear \\"If Dogs Run Free\\" done so differently from its NEW MORNING version, who wouldn't agree that the jazz-riffing \\"Dogs\\" on NM isn't the bolder, more brilliant option? And the song \\"New Morning\\" with horn overdubs is just raucous and wrong, as is the overdubbed \\"Sign on the Window.\\" Of course, the presence of these tracks rather completely undermines the notion that ASP is SELF PORTRAIT...NAKED. Shall I go on? Who needs an alternate of \\"I Threw It All Away\\" that varies so little from NASHVILLE SKYLINE? Why waste CD space with the inclusion of a pair of Isle of Wight live tracks that will wind up duplicated on the bonus discon the deluxe package? [Incidentally, it's a kick to finally hear the Wight concert with professional sound clarity all the way through. Let's hope that Sony will see fit to release a single disc of this show once it's squeezed the big bucks from those who've sprung for the higher-priced spread.]<br /><br />More significantly, not all things are improved by being stripped down. I've always loved \\"Days of '49,\\" \\"Copper Kettle\\" and both versions of \\"Little Sadie\\" on SELF PORTRAIT. They gain nothing by having the overdubs scrubbed away. To my ears, \\"Days\\" and \\"Copper\\" now lack the gravitas and drama they once possessed, and the \\"Sadies\\" are denuded of a whole lot of fingerpickin' fun. \\"Wigwam\\" without the overdubs is just a campfire ditty. But with its lushly absurd undergrowth untrimmed, it's sui generis. What's the point of \\"All the Tired Horses\\" minus those glorious, foolhardy strings smothering a chick chorus crooning a quasi-haiku? That's the kickoff track on SELF PORTRAIT, announcing with a wink and a nod and a \\"nothing/(everything) up my sleeve\\" that the double-LP (as it once was) to follow will maintain an intentional tension between an appearance of proto-Americana simplicity and rococo extravaganza.There's nothing else remotely like it in the Dylan canon. The image popping into my head at this point is the wraparound cover photo of THE BASEMENT TAPES, with its idiosyncratic mix of Bob, the Band and a hallucinatory carnival orchestra--really, nothing like the BASEMENT tracks, but a perfect visual cue for SELF PORTRAIT. Which gets me to thinking about the long and tangled thread linking BASEMENT with these SELF PORTRAIT sessions, a a line reaching back to Dylan's earliest exploration of folk, blues, ballads and fellow songwriters during his embryonic Minnesota coffeehouse days, and reaching ahead to the integration of all of those sources in in all of his work since TIME OUT OF MIND. There's a reason why the title \\"LOVE AND THEFT\\" comes bracketed by those quotation marks.<br /><br />Having stumbled this far down a long pier, I'll bellyflop into the lake and complain that what's really missing from ANOTHER SELF PORTRAIT are the tracks from DYLAN, a/k/a A FOOL SUCH AS I, as its one-shot import CD release was entertainingly retitled. That album, released without Dylan's consent when he briefly left Columbia, suffered the double-whammy of being unfavorably compared to his then-new PLANET WAVES and the perception of being leftover scraps from the already roundly reviled SELF PORTRAIT. Critical revisionism had yet to kick in regarding SP itself; the unanimity of the remarks in these Amazon reviews (trotting in lockstep with David Fricke's review of ASP in Rolling Stone) are evidence that we're still a long way from a proper regard for the rich and strange smorgasbord that is SELF PORTRAIT.<br /><br />ANOTHER SELF PORTRAIT is such a splendid grab-bag because SELF PORTRAIT was so good to begin with, not despite it. I'll be putting together my own mix of tracks from ASP later today. Betcha I can paint a masterpiece.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Really impressive! Now I can track all my activities without even realizing it. Combined with the scale and RunKeeper, this gets very close to body monitoring perfection.
1452101248|5.0|I'm not a vegetarian, but EVERY recipe I've tried in this cookbook has been a winner. I think he goes a little light on his herbs, but that's easy to fix
B008JFUPK8|3.0|This review is for the actual movie and not the blu ray release.  Re imagining Super-man to make him relevant seems like a daunting task, but Zack Synder, David Goyer, and Christopher Nolan were able to pull it off.  Another obstacle to overcome was creating a new theme for the movie, but I am actually very fond of the soundtrack.  It is very difficult to make someone that has almost every every strength imaginable seem vulnerable, but through some interesting story telling it became somewhat believable.  What I like best about the movie was the indecision that Super-man had about becoming a hero and telling the world about himself.  Johnathan Kent (played very well by Kevin Costner) does a very good job raising his adopted son regarding the good side and bad side of humanity.  This was one of Costner's finer performances.  The best part of the movie actually took lace on the planet Kypton and even though the story was strong, it seemed to fall apart after that.  Once of my biggest complaints is that the movie is too long and I felt like there were extra scenes thrown in to make the movie seem more epic than it needed to be.  Those extra scenes actually took away from the plot and also ruined how good the movie looked because of the poor special effects.  SPOILERS AHEAD: I also didn't care for the fact that most of Metropolis and Smallville were damaged in hopes of replicating the effect of the epic battle at the end of the Avengers.  Most of the damage was not caused by the antagonists, but Super-man as he was trying to \\"save\\" everyone.  END SPOLIERS - Overall I enjoyed the movie, but compared to other super hero movies, this one felt a bit flat.  It is a good adventure, but not a great one.  I have pre-ordered the movie, so I am willing to watch it again.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|First few episodes I hated it.  But then I quickly warmed up to it.  Will enjoy to see what is in the future for the Dr.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|You quickly get drawn into the story. I do prefer Harry Potter and Hunger Games over this, but this is not bad for a YA book. I don't like heavy reading or human interest stories, so I do like the characters and plot lines that the author presents. Will read the entire series.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|Awesome read as always!! Love the Stephanie Plum books! Every book brings it all, comedy, action, relatable characters, surprises at every turn. And Diesel's appearance always brings an added element of unpredictability to the story. I can't wait for the next book!
B00EH49DXA|5.0|I love love love this song!!! I love listening to this song while I'm working out or just to listen to music! Great quality and LOVE this song!!
B0081336FO|5.0|The direction is superior and the suspense is palpable. Acting by Cumberbatch (playing Sherlock) is superb, especially when he rattles of an analysis of a person by their look, clothing, hands, etc. Can't wait to see the 3rd season. Unlike American mystery shows, the language is high-brow, the settings are impeccably thought out, and the violence is muted.<br />It is a pity that the series has only 3 episodes a season.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|It should have been better.  Books are typically so much richer and have greater detail than the tv or movie remake.  This book fell far below that expectation.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A fun series with interesting characters.  My daughter and I both really enjoy it.  The actors fit the parts perfectly.
B00BNUBK46|5.0|We took it on our trip to the lava caves, it was the best light there! People were commenting on what a great light it was!
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I like the story overall and a few of the characters, but it's a shame where the series is headed.  The first season was perfect, but this one starts to bring things into the series that weren't as prevalent before, which seems like just bad writing on George R. R. Martin's end.  Knowing what happens in the third season, I know it only gets worse from here.  Hopefully the fourth season and beyond are a lot better and make more sense.  For HBO to continue making great money off of this show, Martin really needs to stop killing off primary characters for little to no reason.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|For those who are Satch fans, you will like this one. I would rate it somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. Good creativity and many songs that are similar in make up to other ones Joe has made in the past. Some have a problem with that, wanting the musician to come up with some new breed of song. Get a life. This is great music from an extremely talented guitarist. Enjoy it.<br />MacBayne
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I can't wait for Season 4-It is my favorite show!!  It is the only show my husband and I watch together.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this show but I was quickly mistaken.  Wonderful show to get caught up in.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I had used a friend's H2 LCD BacPac (non-touch) while on vacation for a couple weeks prior to buying this for my H3.  The LCD Touch is better for anything where you don't need the waterproof housing.  I think that it makes operation of the camera easier and it's good (and fun) to be able to see what you shot immediately.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It's a fun, clean and entertaining show.  The characters are well developed.  We've enjoyed watching it at home when we have time.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|I took it out on a dive this past week and it worked great!  I'll be interested to check it in various conditions but the colors on the video were more true to what I saw.  It's easy to use, fits perfectly on the GoPro Hero 3  housing.<br /><br />The reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that I put a small scratch in it as I was caught up in the surf and it glanced a rock.  On the positive side though it's easier and cheaper to replace the filter than the housing if it gets worse.
B004GJIL34|1.0|I started to watch this and had to turn off quickly. This isn't my type of movie. It's one of those movies you just can't get into.
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Good show.  I like the characters and action.  Plot development works and it works for there to be more of these shows.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I share this account with another person with evernote who lives far away. being able to sync our notes is great.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|I love gore but this was so stupid. The whole slow mo thing was dumb and the movie was just bad vile. I don't mind a vile action movie if the vile has a purpose but this movie just sucked. I wouldn't even consider it worth watching once. I watched it only because i was working on other things so i figure i didn't waste too much of my life on this horrible movie. I really can't even go into detail because it is just so dumb i feel like i'll waste even more of my life thinking about it. The first half of the movie was alright but it just got worse and worse in the second half......sigh<br /><br />lol i spelled level as leaves earlier....should spell check and not write it at 4 am :)
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This intricate dance between the present and past of a very wounded person helps one empathize and not judge. How flowers and their meanings are intertwined with the characters is brilliant. At times it seemed too sad to continue but the hope of past and present meeting again propels one to keep reading. This book is fresh in every sense and truly original.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It help me a lot and gets me out of a lot of jams. my math is not the greatest. thanks
B0095P31L6|5.0|Watch Rango on my kindle and it was fantastic!!! Great sound and picture!!! The movie was in HD and had a crystal clear picture. Love amazon prime movies!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|lately it has been freezing and force closing an most of the time I don't have Internet so when internet is not avaliable I cant play cause it keeps closing
B008Y768XO|5.0|Very sweet and emotional movie.. A perfect way of saying love got no boundaries and showed the power of gratitude..
B00509898G|5.0|I cannot review this classic work here.<br /><br />The first rule about Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club....
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I use this everyday to log my workouts on my Kindle Fire! Such a great product, I can't even tell it's not Excel.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Now, this book is app good, it's great! I believe it's one of the best books like ever written for young people to read. I ACTUALLY liked it myself &I'm an adult! I think it's worth the $$$ that it costs. I would buy this book even if I had little $$$!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A great challenging game either on it phone, kindle or iPad!! I tell everyone about this game. Great time killer!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Intelligent, witty, action packed, with a superb cast.<br />What is there not to like about House of Cards?<br />Wish we could find more series of this caliber!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love my case. I have told so many people about it. I have had so many close calls on dropping my phone in water. My case is more of a safety mechanism.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was challenging and very difficult at first.I would have liked some direction at the beginning instead of having to guess my way through. It is not a game that I have seen or tried before so that made it interesting and much more of a challenge. I would recommend it if you like to find things.
1419705644|5.0|it has the type of humor in it that Adventure Time fans will enjoy. Also the book is pretty physically well made if condition is something you worry about.
0439023491|4.0|Not as good as the first of the series but nonetheless a fun read.  I enjoyed the book and have recommended it to others.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Honestly? I thought I would hate this movie. I rented it, hoping that perhaps my initial thoughts would be proven wrong, and boy did it! This movie is really cute. I love the thoughts of the main Zombie &#34;R&#34;! They were so funny! I almost imagine any guy thinking the same things. The acting was done well, and the story was great. I would suggest this to any girl looking for romance with some comedy in it, and even some thrills! Of course, this isn't for everyone, so if you aren't into romance or zombies...probably not for you. But I must say, that I loved it after it was done! Very well done! :)
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is such fun when waiting at the airport, on an airplane, doctor's office, etc. etc.  And it's a good way to bond with young kids.  They are so good at this!  It's just plain fun.
B00DU74U74|4.0|Honestly, when I watch a movie based off of a novel I've read, I never am sure if it will be up to par with the book. This movie was actually fairly accurate. Not 100%, but it was up there. I liked it enough that in the future I may purchase it if I'm just wanting something to watch. Personally, I think having an attractive actor for the men is great, and they did okay with Jared, but I wasn't sure about the other guy...nonetheless, it was good. Followed story well enough, and it was good enough that viewers can enjoy it.
0439023513|5.0|I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone.  It's fast-paced and has a high interest level.  Should be on every teen's reading list.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|This was very well done! The actors and actresses were very good! i'd suggest this to any girl looking for romance and a bit of a thrill to watch. I love chick-flicks, and I think this fits into that category. :)
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|In a word - HYSTERICAL. I love this grumpy cat with his grumpy humour..... Bring on the next book - NO - bring on a series !!!!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|This movie was interesting. I liked it more than I thought I would, and I would recommend this to those that like a little bit of romance mixed in with Adventure. I've found that you have to look for the positive in movies today, and this movie was actually great compared to many I've seen. The giants were a bit scary and weird, but that was to be expected. Enjoy!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|How could anyone not love Andrea Bocelli's voice and classical and contemporary interpretation of music from many genres.<br />I hope you continue to carry his CD's and DVD's.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The concept of this movie was interesting. I can't say it was my favorite, but it's worth watching a couple of times. There's a bit of action and of course, there's that bit of romance and mystery mixed in. There were twists to the plot that I was really thrown for a loop, but I followed fairly well. (And if anyone knew me, they'd know I don't catch onto things very quickly sometimes!) I don't really understand the reason for sex in movies, or even nudity considering that the best stories are portrayed without that crap..however, putting that aside, I liked the movie alright. It's a little slow, but interesting.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|It's another good American's hero movie. In my opinion it's better than some action movie. And hope the next part gonna be good too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just cannot wait for the next season... It was an absolute favorite of mine. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good watch!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game gets you thinking, if you want to keep yourself busy buy it, its fun. it gets harder they should give you more hints
B00D5YNQMW|5.0|Aeromsith Rocks.  That is all you need to know.  Could have done without some of the songs being cut short.  A full length blu-ray concert would be cool in the future.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  It is as good or better than the first in this series.  Keep my attention all the way through.
B00846REIS|5.0|Its was difficult for me to read at first because i kept comparing to 50 shades but I started to love it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game kept me busy for a few hours but only 10 levels. Would have enjoyed more puzzle aspects. Overall fun for passing time!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Love it all the time,  I bought it to teach my daughter to sing some of the songs and play some of the pieces in movie on piano.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|We watched this movie with 2 kids, 11 and 12 both girls.  They enjoyed it quite a bit.  Hoping to buy it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So tood to be able to read God's word, any version you prfer.<br /><br />It also provided organized chapter by chapter, verse by verse look up.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|Love the first season, especially the Pilot, Neal and Mozzie are the best, love their scheming..they are very loveable con men
B003FNWR6Y|4.0|Packaging was great, It arrived on time. HOWEVER... the only characters my son and I know are the Mario characters such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi.  There are so many on there that I don't know. Perhaps it would have been better if it were made up of games instead of characters that you buy.
B009AY04A8|5.0|the game is interesting and entertaining to play.  only had trouble with one puzzle but got through that and going for the finish. I love this game very enjoyable. keep up the fun.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Couldn't put it down! Great story line, kept your attention. I just love Nicholas Sparks's books! Definitely recommend. You'll love it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I haven't played this game, but my daughter loves it.  Seems to be challenging, holds her interest.  I think it's worth giving it a try.
B006UKPCSE|5.0|I saw this film when I was a teenager and I was very pleased to watch it again. Excellent history, very entertaining, and wonderful quality of film (preservation). I saw it in Blue Ray.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Either I'm missing the point of this game, or it's just plain stupid.  I do not recommend this one at all.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I like this series by Charlaine Harris.  I also bought the book for the kindle for my daughter's birthday.  I have read all of these books and am sorry to hear the series has ended.  I think the books are far better then the series based on Ms. Harris' books that is on cable TV.
B00EDF43MY|1.0|this game nags constantly to get you to give ratings and see their other stuff. wow for a paid app
B009AY04A8|5.0|I enjoy hidden object games -was looking for one on the Kindle Fire.  This is pretty good.  The scenes are not dark and easy to find the things if you are clever.
B00EDF43MY|3.0|Even though the app is free, I still have not started playing, apparently you are forced to rate it before you play.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|looks good, feels better than expected, great everyday wearer.<br />I was expecting to have it regulated and was going to swap out the hands.<br />it looks so good and runs 5 seconds a day slow, pretty good for an automatic, at this stage I'm going to leave it as is an look into some other strap options. very happy
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie brings together several story lines, great action heroes, and has a number of great battle scenes.  Definitely worth watching.
B001FOPODS|5.0|Very beautiful, a feast to all our senses!<br />For adult and older children! The music can touch your soul deeply!
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|Creative tracks and great continuity between songs. best album this year, behind good kid mad city, in my book. highly recommended.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is entertaining. I enjoy playing. I like that they read the numbers quickly and I'm able to play multiple cards without getting lost.
B007IK44CK|3.0|You've seen one Mission Impossible, you've seen them all.  I got about half way through the movie and got bored stiff.  Same stunts, same desperation, same double cross, same angst.....there have been, in my opinion, very few sequels that kept the shine of the initial movie - most of the Lethal Weapon sequels were good, the Harry Potter sequels were all excellent and, a rarity, the third Twilight movie was actually BETTER than the first, but then if there had been a budget of more than $2.50 for that movie it could have been better......no wait, no it couldn't.  Anyway, if you are a Tom Cruise fan, can't get enough of the action movie genre and aren't a deep thinker (requisite for action movies) watch this one post haste.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was stupendous! I couldn't put it down. Even when I was at school, I could not stop thinking about it. I just couldn't wait to get home and continue reading it! Totally one of my favorites!!!
B0001I561E|5.0|One of my daughter's favorite princesses is Jasmine! She was so happy to see this for the first time, which made her father and I very happy as well. My daughter really loves the pets in the story, Jasmine's tiger Rajah and Aladdin's monkey Abu. Now every tiger she sees is Rajah, lol. I really like how it shows both worlds, the rich and the poor, and how their sufferings can still be similar. Princess Jasmine is sheltered and not free to make her own decisions and she feels trapped in the Palace. Aladdin, a homeless boy, is always having to find ways to survive on the streets by stealing food and necessities and he feels trapped by that desperation and helplessness. They both come together and show each other how the grass is not always greener on the other side, and what really makes you happy is not money and material things, but the love of a genuine person. The evil character Jafar is a little scary but not so much that my daughter was affected by him at all. And the Genie is the funniest character of all!! He will have you rolling! My daughter also really likes the magic carpet, which I think is genius to have in this cartoon. Above all, one of our family favorites!!
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|Stop reading and start watching. Don't waste your time by not watching this movie immediately. It will make your life better. You will be happier. The sky will be bluer. Your pathetic meaningless life will be suddenly filled with meaning. WATCH IT NOW.
B000IVW25M|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs!! Sneezy is her favorite character!! I recently found out that Snow White was the very first Disney Princess and dates back to 1937!!! So I am excited that my daughter loves her so much, as I did when I was a little girl. I particularly like how Snow White takes care of the Dwarfs and they take care of her too. What a great lesson in good old fashioned friendship. I also like the message that vanity only leads to bad things, beauty will always fade, but friendship will last a lifetime! The evil queen is a bit menacing and orders her huntsman to KILL Snow White and bring her heard back in a wood box, so if your child gets scared easily I would recommend fast forwarding through her scenes until your child is a little older and can handle it. But the dwarfs are so hilarious and Snow White is just as lovely as ever! A classic I recommend to all little princesses!!
B00422LESO|3.0|It's super cute but not stellar writing but if you love Jane Austen and if you REALLY love Mr Dacy than read it.
1577314808|5.0|Arrived fast and as advertised. Purchased book for a friend because I read it and believe everyone should have a copy. I have no complaints.
B007L5LD9O|5.0|I liked the movie...was not sure about Gwyneth Paltrow playing Emma, but some how it worked. I would recommend it to someone who like these types of books.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have the computer version so I already knew I would probably enjoy this.<br />I was not disappointed. Played great on my Kindle Fire.
B00C6Q6OAG|4.0|my daughter loved it, it arrived as described with no delay and my little baby girl loves both of the dolls.
0061743526|5.0|There is nothing, at all, that I did not love about this book. It's a wonderful read. I recommend it.
B005D0RDO8|5.0|It's kind of hard these days to write an opinion of Pier Paolo Passolini's final film SALO. Why? Because so many others have written at length, either praising or damning it - often for the same reasons, so what is left to about the film?<br /><br />That being said I will offer my two cents about this notorious film. This is a hard film to say you like because of its content. The brutal violence, the sadistic sexual, physical, emotion, and mental torture - it is very hard to watch. But, knowing that the film was adapted to be a protest against facism makes the film a little easier to swallow.<br /><br />This film is not for everyone. But anyone who doesn't mind watching something extreme, but extreme with a purpose, then you will appreciate the film even though you may not like it.

B008TRUDAS|4.0|Okay I usually read erotic romance books. This is not one. It really has a great story and is very interesting but you will need to get out your crying towel cause there are places in this book that just bring on the tears. I do recommend this book for your reading pleasure if you like crying once in awhile.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love to pass my idle hours with mahjong. This one is good because it's original version and not some cutsey newer take on the idea. My problem with this is that it is too limited. It needs more patterns or more difficult ones.
B00000E2VC|2.0|I am really sorry with you all that consider this record \\"sublime\\" or whatever...<br />Many great pianists have broken their necks trying to interpret Chopin´s mazurkas.Eventually, only a handful achieve this task with joyful results. Maybe you should try sometime to hear dear old Rubinstein, and certainly Kapell,Ashkenazy,Harasiewicz...<br />Benedetti´s are heavy handed interpretations, that totally miss the point.But,more than anything, they miss the mazurka rythm altogether,and produce some sort of unconfortable waltz-like sensation.<br />Anyway,I am glad you can actually dream while listening to them.Good dreams!
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|It does create beautiful images. But, then what? It becomes boring. Needs a bit more functionality. Great visualizations if that's what you want.
1781162646|2.0|The worst book I read this summer was Stephen King's \\"Joyland\\". There is no joy in reading this book. The book in short is about a boy who gets a summer job at a pier called Joy Land during the early 1960s. Our hero is trying to survive his first job and a broken heart. Boring is the word that best fits this book. Boring are the growing pains between childhood and adulthood. Boring to hear that people we are to think of as freaks are not,and a boring little trip to see the \\"ghost\\", as in who wants to see a real dead ghost. I enjoy Stephan King's less frightening novels but this one was in a word a bore. It's not a even a good pulp fiction thriller. It was much too dull. However it is a good book to read before you want to go to sleep. The only thing this book did was separate a fool from their money---guess who the fool was---Baffle raffle over and out to nap time after Kings book.

B007MDB71O|5.0|In the beginning, Edgar Rice Burroughs begat the original \\"cowboy versus aliens\\" story about John Carter and his adventures on the Red Planet of Mars, and our nerdy forefathers of a century ago saw that it was good. Decades later, the John Carter saga begat the Star Trek and Star Wars space-operas that fueled the imaginations of a new generation of fantasy and science-fiction fans and creators. The popularity of these new films and the technological advances that came with them then begat the new John Carter film, and it is very good, as well as being the craziest Ouroboros circle-of-life scenario in pop culture history.<br /><br />The new film takes some liberties with the John Carter of Mars tale that fans of the Burroughs' books will note, but the gist of the story remain intact. While mining for gold in the Arizona desert, Civil War hero John Carter is attacked by hostile Indians and when he takes refuge in a mysterious cave he suddenly finds himself transported to the distant planet Mars (or Barsoom) where he finds himself in the middle of a battle between warring alien races over the meager resources of a dying planet.<br /><br />Because of Mars' lower gravity, Captain Carter finds he has increased strength and the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound (if this sounds like Superman, you're right; Kal-El creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were inspired by the John Carter books when they created Superman in 1938.) His abilities intrigue the tusked, four-armed warrior aliens known as the Tharks, and they see him as tool that they can use against their enemies.<br /><br />Carter soon finds himself mixed up with the Princess of Mars, Dejah Thoris of the Martian empire of Helium, and he must decide between helping the Tharks, helping Dejah and Helium, or helping himself by trying to get back to Earth and his goldmine. Like any red-blooded American, Carter chooses the hot alien princess.<br /><br />If you are uninitiated in Barsoomian lore, then you might find yourself a little lost in the mix of Therns, Tharks, calots, thoats, Zodangans and the white apes that make up the world of John Carter, but don't let that dissuade you. As a lifelong fan, it was a little hard to keep up myself, but that's all part of the fun. After all, who knew what a Wookiee was before Star Wars?<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch, who played Gambit in the X-Men Origins: Wolverine film, does an excellent job as John Carter, with just the right blend of gentleman and stalwart swagger. The pulp-fiction hero of the Burroughs books revels in his role of warrior and he always has a hankering for the heat of battle, and while that predilection may seem odd to today's modern man, it is an essential part of the Carter character and it is well delivered in Kitsch's performance.<br /><br />Dejah Thoris is played by Lynn Collins, who also stared as Silver Fox in the X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. There are some huge shoes to fill in this role as the Princess of Mars and any actress would find it difficult to deliver on this literary warrior woman who launched the imaginations and libidos of untold thousands of fanboys and fantasy artists. Collins does a great job portraying Dejah's three B's; brains, battle-prowess and (let's face it folks, this is fantasy film) breasts. My only complaint is that she seemed a little older than I expected, but as Martians can live up to 1,000 years old, I'm sure she is still quite young.<br /><br />Other characters in John Carter are voiced by some well know talent including Willem Dafoe as Carter's four-armed friend Tars Tarkas, Thomas Haden Church as Tal Hajus the Jeddak (leader) of the Thark clan, Samantha Morton as Sola, Tars Tarkas' daughter, and Polly Walker as Sarkoja, the Tharkian troublemaker extraordinaire. But the biggest stars in John Carter are its special effects and animation which, from the steampunk-influenced airships to the Thark aliens and white apes, is downright amazing.<br /><br />Of special mention isthe computer animated character of Woola, John Carter's Martian calot (dog). The interplay between Carter and the CGI critter perfectly captures the feeling of the book, when Carter's only friend on this savage and hostile planet was this beast that repays his human's kindness with unwavering loyalty. Call it corny if you will, but I loved it.<br /><br />It is easy to lovingly sing the praises of this film that brings a lifetime of dreams and fantasies to life, but John Carter is not without its minor problems. Writer-director Andrew Stanton has added an Outlaw Josey Wales-style back story to the Carter origin that potentially helps explain some of his motivations in the story, but that I think was completely unnecessary and distracting. The screenplay combines storylines from at least the first three Burroughs books (A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars and The Warlord of Mars) and the result is a somewhat convoluted narrative that might make some moviegoers feel lost.<br /><br />Another problem is in some of the casting. While great efforts were made to create distinct animated characters that stood out on their own, some of the humanoid (real) actors looked and acted too much alike to be able to distinguish one from the other. This can probably be attributed to Andrew Stanton's lack of experience with human actors, as John Carter is this Pixar director's first live-action picture. Case in point is James Purefoy as Kantos Kan (good guy) and Dominic West as Sab Than (bad guy). These actors look enough alike that sometimes it's hard to tell which is which. Throw in Mark Strong as shapeshifter Matai Shang, who sometimes changes into one or both of these other characters, and you become more confused than a calot chasing its tail.<br /><br />Old-fashioned, corny melodrama is what the John Carter pulp fiction \\"interplanetary romance\\" stories are all about. If this is something you are predisposed to dislike, then you are not going to care for this movie, but if you area fantasy fan then John Carter is a lifelong dream come true. This Disney film harkens back to the Walt Disney live-action movies like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and more modern Disney fare like The Rocketeer and I felt it had the distinct Disney feel of innocent naiveté - and I mean that in an endearingly good way. But don't think that because it is sentimental that John Carter is not subsequently bad-ass. There are several battle sequences that would make Frank Frazetta blush and that are sure to appease hardened action fans. To see these scenes come life is almost a religious experience for a fanboy like myself.<br /><br />John Carter of Mars has been with us for a hundred years and like Edgar Rice Burroughs' fictional character, he will live forever, continuing to influence generations of fantasy fans, artists, scientists and dreamers to come. Not enough can be said about this serious effort to bring the legend to life. Is it perfect? No, but it was worth the wait, and I can't wait for more.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I loved it. Exciting and fun. I could know put it down. 5 stars why not 10. I would play more games like this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics. Love the way you can feed,  groom,  clean,  muck. You can purchase horses and tack. You can enter your horse in competitions. I love the game and it is the app I play the most on my Kindle.
B00498YZH8|3.0|I'd heard such great things about this movie, I thought it was going to be fantastic. Wasn't that great, IMO. Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic, of course. But the movie itself was so-so.
0440237688|5.0|Wow! I love Lois Lowry and her writing. The Giver is a great book for all ages. I loved reading it as my school novel. So many details about Jonas's community and how it works. Definitely read it!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game brings back memories. I really enjoy it. It can really get hectic at times but the game play is very smooth.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|An extremely fun and challenging game, but not impossibly frustrating. =)  Looking forward to more levels in the future. This kept me marvelously occupied while I was sitting &quot;watching&quot; something. Talk about needing to think outside the box!
B002CLBJPK|5.0|it was a gift for a family just wanted to thank you for it! My sister has been looking for this movie every where thank you again
B003QTSMXE|5.0|One of my favorite movies! stunning, giddy, contemplative, engaging, simply beautiful. One of the few modern blockbusters with a well thought out plot that actually develops the story continuously and has a story within a story. If the idea of watching puppies in space suits try to play fetch in zero gravity appeals to you then you will love this movie :)<br /><br />I'm also very fond of how well the movie makes use of limited speech. You don't even care or notice that the majority of the movie has no dialogue because it doesn't need it to shine!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I liked this movie and have viewed it more than once. The problem is sometimes I like it and other times I wonder what I was thinking. Nevertheless, I keep going back to watch it again. It can become addictive! I recommend you see it for yourself, it is worth a first look.
B000FC130E|5.0|I am a huge Gaiman fan, and this is my favorite of his works. The characters are realistic, the story is by turns hilarious and suspenseful, and a page-turner throughout.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show it's very addicting. I can't wait for season 3 to become available. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We purchased the chromecast the week it was released. It was simple, came with the device and a power cord. Was surprisingly easy to setup and use. We have used it on multiple televisions, including in hotels where it's often difficulty to find things to watch.<br /><br />Iniitally,I had concerns about the quality if the video since I was running it through the Netflix on iPhone 5. I decided for the price it was well worth a try. Amazingly good quality video. Iuse it through iphone, ipad, and android phone. I have been able to watch through my iPad shows  often blocked for video out (SHO, HBO, TBS, NBC) through the in screen Chrome feature with little to no complications.<br /><br />This is an excellent buy, and turns any tv with HDMI input into a smart TV. I would definitely recommend purchasing, and even purchased an additional device to permanently use in the kids room.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I was surprised about how comical this movie was but at the same time presented the hardships of life. Ryan gosling was so great well all the actors were. You will want too see his no fail move hehhh.  This is one of the best romance movies I have seen in a while and if is defiently shelf worthy, I liked the message of the movie ; I think people should take it take it to heart and make sure they are making an effort in their relationships.
B00E1L9N8E|4.0|The movie is quite sad, but overall it is really entertaining. Definitely worth watching several times. Also, Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing as usual.
B00B0VI1XQ|3.0|Though I liked this album, I still feel that Black Sands is the best album he's put out. It could be Andreya Trianna's voice, or the time in my life (or the triptych!), but there was something magical in that album, and North Borders falls just a bit shy.<br /><br />Despite that, I first heard most tracks at a live concert, and it was a wonderful show as usual.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVE IT! I am ready for new levels. Played all levels in one night. Very addictive! This game will have you thinking on your toes. I recommend you get this game and it is free!
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|This is not the ambitious young man from his early first albums, or the distraught older man from 808. Kanye says here that he doesn't care anymore and puts out what might be &#34;his&#34; album; something he wanted to hear, himself. This is not anything like modern rap; he takes rhythms in their own direction, adds a lot of heavy bass and synthesizer noise. Some lyrics seem like they're meant to offend and little more.<br /><br />I still liked it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One great story couldn't put this book down. Can't wait to start the next one. From the first page to the last
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Nothing new to say about the product, works well on my Samsung galaxy s4. Not sure what else to add really
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Excellent product and seller.<br />Highly recommended.<br />This product don't add volume to the cellphone and protects the glass from risks on surfaces.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Being a rugby addict I love the chromecast - it allows me to catch up on games not broadcast on free to air tv.<br />It was relatively easy to set up - took a bit of mucking around but once away it is going no problems!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Intelligent story lines and fabulously developed characters. Final scene of season 2 is smokin' hot! Can't wait to see Season 3!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Amazing depiction of a family set in the traditions of past centuries as it transitions into the 20th with wars, economic difficulties and cultural changes. Wonderful cast!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Download was quick.  I am use to a white noise machine while sleeping.  At the hotel I realized it was way too quiet and both my husband and I could not sleep.  Quick download and this lasted all night with so many options, I slept great the rest of the night!  Would give it a 10 star if I could
B00797MB0O|5.0|This movie caught me by surprise. I hadn't heard about it at all and stumbled upon it on cable. Seeing Charlize Theron didn't pique my interest one way or the other, but I liked the others in the cast as well as the director, so I stuck around. What a fortunate discovery!<br /><br />The plot of this movie involves a small town homecoming for a mildly famous, alcoholic, self-loathing, ghost writer (Theron), overflowing with contempt, delusions of grandeur, and relentless narcissism. The writing is brilliant and the moving performances by Theron and Patton Oswalt make it shine even more.<br /><br />What stands out most for me is the way in which writer Diablo Cody captures the dichotomy between those who left their small towns and those who stayed. In particular, she addressed with deadly accuracy what happens when we create stereotypes to make us feel better about our damaged lives. I left my small town after high school, and it took me a while to realize that not everyone who stayed there was a loser, nor everyone who left better because of it. The only truth we can count on is that we've all changed, the past is dead, and all that has happened in between merely transformed that old friend into a familiar stranger. Cody doesn't give us the epiphany moment (thankfully), but rather allows us to see how we all deal with the past in various ways, and how that shapes our self-image.<br /><br />The unfortunately high number of one star votes reveals a lot about the expectations of movie fans for escapism, simple answers, and uncomplicated characters. You're not going to get much of that in Young Adult. What you will get is a brutally honest movie about a side of life that most don't want to acknowledge. Sometimes escape isn't a viable solution, answers aren't simple, and people are problematically complex. This movie is for those people.
B004L3AQLU|3.0|Jake G's acting is atrocious. The premise is stupid, and the ending is utterly saccharine. But you gotta love Ann's physical form, which she struts confidently.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|The headline says enough.  Zombie meets girl.  Zombie falls in love.  Apocalypse averted.  Enjoyed Rob Corddry's acting in this one too.
159463176X|3.0|The book was hard to read when broken up into short readings.  Probably best read in one or two sessions such as on a long plane flight.  The jumping forth between time periods and different persons views of things cropping up all the time.  It was interesting how the selling of a child had such an effect on so many people, but a difficult road to travel to get there.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am SO happy that Season 3 of Downton Abbey is available on Amazon Prime.  What a treat it has been to watch it...I am now all set for Season 4!
1936719010|5.0|Loved &#34;The War Of Art&#34; and I loved this book as well. It's chock full of very useful inspirational advise! Just ordered his &#34;Turning Pro&#34; and firmly believe it'll be awesome as well!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just challenging enough to keep me going. Love this game and hope they create more like it. Keep up the good work.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|I loved this book it transported me to a whole new world. The fantasy aspect is enthralling. A big YES from me!

B00EV4EUT8|5.0|The Butler, whose real name is Eugene Allen, is one of the strongest men I have ever heard of in the 50+ years I've been living on this earth! I can only imagine the psychological strength it must take to keep one's self-control when you are confronted by so much evil, shallowness and contempt. Forget about politics for a moment, this film is the psychological study of a man who is the ultimate survivor! And if I was ever imprisoned someday in a Concentration camp this is the kind of man I would want to have in the bunk next to mine!<br /><br />In the very last scene there was a quite an ironic moment when out of all the Presidential tie clasps The Butler had to choose from he decides to wear LBJ's! President Johnson domestic agenda accomplished so much it defies comprehension: The passing of major civil rights bills, huge aid increases in education, the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, urban renewal programs, the Clean Air Act of 1963, the Wilderness Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Public Architectural Barriers Act, the Public Broadcasting Act, beautification programs, development aid for depressed regions throughout the United States, a wide-scale fight against poverty and the removal of obstacles to the right to vote, in addition to the creation of the Head Start program and the Food Stamps program. Let us not forget the passage of the Gun Control Act (and he was from Texas, for God's Sake!) Under Johnson, NASA conducted the Gemini manned space program, developed the Saturn V rocket used by the Apollo and Skylab programs and made the first manned Apollo program flights. KEEP IN MIND JOHNSON PUSHED ALL THIS THOUGH CONGRESS IN LESS THAN 6 YEARS! I don't want to minimize the evil President Johnson did in Vietnam, but no President has done more for every American LIVING TODAY than LBJ and the Democratic Congress under his leadership! Every four years, I literally pray for a domestic policy version of LBJ to win the White House! To date, President Obama comes closest with his expansion of health care insurance and getting us through the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression.<br /><br />For those conservatives who believe Ronald Reagan is ready for sainthood, he did more harm than good. Sure he was a nice guy, but I could care less about how nice he was. Even he admits he was on the wrong side of history! What more do you want? The irony is that by today's crazy Republican party standards Reagan would be considered a flaming liberal!<br /><br />The Butler is a synopsis of some of the most important moments in United States history witnessed by one incredibly brave man!

B000059HB7|5.0|Everybody must have some time or other seen at least one western film starring John Wayne.  In my opinion this is one of his best and it includes a very good unusual performance by Dean Martin who we know more for singing and humorous films.  It had been a long time since I saw this film and it brought for me a lot of nostalgia. I was very happy when at last after many years of acting and over 150 films he was given his Oscar for his leading role of Marshall Rooster Cogburn In True Grit.
0061122416|5.0|My son loved it.  I am older and forgetful, so I will need to read it again.  I think it was another one of my favorites, but I can't remember why.  Will definitely have to read it again!  It came in excellent condition and very speedily.  We love the service by amazon.com and all those from whom we have ordered.  We are never disappointed!

B008BM9L72|2.0|Whilst there were some interesting sexual,practices that certainly opened my eyes, the overall plot was shallow, repetitive and incredibly boring!! Very little character development which was a missed opportunity and a story line that could also have had some more depth would certainly enhance this trilogy. Very glad I bought a kindle version as would not liked to have thought that trees were killed to have a printed version!!
B004G606K8|5.0|Great story!!! A very imaginative tale of fantasy with knights, dragons and elves!! With today's technology, it would make a great movie!!!

B00B2GK4KW|5.0|It's not available in Singapore and it came speedily.  Easy to use, usual signature design fit for not only scrap booking but party setting, food deco and many other usages.  Value choice.
0307271080|5.0|I have enjoyed reading Chimamanda's books but this one was the most surreal. As A Nigerian-Ameriacan who had a similar background to that of Ifemelu and also moved to the US in my late teens, i felt that i was reading a book about myself! I had to stop a couple of times to call my friend and read parts of the book to her and say \\"were we not talking about this last week?\\". It was definitely great to have my feelings and thoughts about hair, immigration and race. This is a must read for all people.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Tom Cruise doesn't disappoint...this movie is one of his best. Sometimes it's nice to be typecast. Can't wait for the sequel.  Great flick!

B000JCSPG0|4.0|It's a good story and a good lead in to the series in that it lays the ground work to add just enough history and lore to entice.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|This true-story book was extremely well-written - to the point I felt I were living each moment right there behind bars.  The author is candid about negative and positive experiences of prison life as well depicting her fellow inmates and guards in terms of real people with faults and yet 'gifts' to bring to themselves and fellow prisoners inside prison walls.  I felt empathy for a good many prisoners almost to wishing I could do something to help them with their incarceration.  This book is great reading.

B009AY04A8|3.0|Run of the mill hidden object game, but with a storyline. Graphics are clear, dialogue is a little campy, but the game is fun.
B006HAPY26|5.0|it is an interesting book.<br />a little more on the adult side.<br />i would recommend it for any  young adult
0062255657|2.0|I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book.  In fact, I pre-ordered it. I'd read the Sandman series, and American Gods, and Good Omens, and bits and pieces of other stuff Neil Gaiman has written.  But this was a major disappointment.  It started out alright, but fell apart completely within 50 pages.  Tired plot line, tedious devices.  I agree with the reviewer who said this is neither \\"adult\\" nor a \\"novel.\\"  Others have waxed rhapsodic about the glowing language and delicate touch of this book, but it felt flat and lifeless to me, more of a retreaded Narnia than anything else.  And the narrative voice is almost unendurably childish, in the worst sense.  People keep saying the narrator is seven years old, but he isn't.  The narrator is forty-five or so, remembering an alarming episode that happened when he was seven.  He is an adult, talking to other adults, and ought to sound like it. Gaiman can freaking well WRITE; anyone who has read American Gods or Down to A Sunless Sea knows that.  But you wouldn't know it from this book.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Really enjoyed it - fast read, entertaining, light hearted.  Classic Neil Gaiman novel at it's best.  Highly recommended for all reading levels.  A beautiful fairy tale.

B00E1L9N8E|5.0|This movie is like a piece of moving art. The characters are complex. This is not so much a love story as it is a story about values. Great movie.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I'd seen the movie several times, but seeing it on BluRay made it better. The special effects budget for the movie allowed for some gorgeous exterior shots of Serenity. You can see the ship's flaws better, even see the rainwater flowing off the ship at the end. I'm new to BluRay, but felt it was worth the money to see it in more theatre detail. It did that!<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I think people who haven't seen the TV show can easily follow the movie. There's an amazing shot in the beginning that steadycams through the guts of the ship and introduces you to almost the entire crew and the layout of the ship. You get introduced fast. If in doubt stay for the fight scene with River. 90 pound girl &#62; entire bar full of ruffians.

B007GP1CC2|5.0|I agree completely with the enthusiastic reviews here. This is an absolutely outstanding set, at an amazingly low price. Jacqueline du Pr&eacute; was a truly remarkable musician, and her verve, thoughtfulness and sheer brilliance show in every one of these fine recordings. It is true that the notes are basic at best, but at this price for 17 superb CDs I don't think one can carp.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|Normally, having read a good book will often drive you to the movie or TV show based thereon. In this case, I started the books because I really enjoyed the show. I'm glad I did. The books are very engaging. The characters are similar, but somewhat different than the show. Walt is ~close. Vic is different in appearance and a lot different in temperment than the actress in the series, Katie Sackoff (?). It's not the actress fault; she's not a short dynamo of a brunette and there's no way a TV show could duplicate Vic's incessantly profane dialogue from the novels. Henry Standing Bear is very close to the TV portrayal. The plots are excellent and half way thru the series, I haven't guessed the end on one yet. I know when I finish the most recent, I'll be sorry and suck up the next one ASAP.
B003VANOFY|2.0|First of all, build quality it's just good, it fits everything i would want in a wireless headset, i can walk around free to go get something to eat and get back to the computer, you won't get much range to stay though(my house is small).  But there are some things i dont really liked, the software, ugh, i was really looking foward to set my g keys for Teamspeak, guess what, feature not included( includes ventrilod though) but well, the software did provided me the tools to develop myself a script to use with a teamspeak plugin, so, so far so good, the \\"7.1\\" I dont honestly think i'll ever use it.  The microphone, no complaint, no compliment either.  The mic boom though, it includes this feature when if it's raised it will mute itself, pretty handy, and can physicaly be muted to, thats nice.  The volume controller, Oh, every headset should have this, it's just so usefull, i would say it could be it's best feature.  The only thing bugging me, thats kinda actually my fault, its the software, your headset will pretty much sound like s*** without it, any g keys will work, the volume control either, BUT when i do have the software running it will slow down my computer(old hp tx2 though) but it think that should't happend, anyways  IMHO this is a great headset, but could improve, i would do recommend this one to a friend.    EDIT 10/11/2013  Out of nowhere, a horrible crackling noise start from time to time, considering how expensive this was, i SHOUL'd bought the corsair one, i will never buy any logis*** again.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|I chose this rating because this movie featured one of my favorite actresses, Judi Dench. I admire that she continues to act inspite of her age-- which is my age. I loved that the characters, inspite of their age, continue to travel , enjoy life and explore its possibilities. Like me, they look honestly at their relationships and address issues that must be addressed. I enjoyed that they went to India and as a viewer  I had a chance to see different parts of a country I visited 12 years ago. Additionally, I had a chance to learn more about its culture. The storyline was very much to my liking!  The review I had read about the movie previous to seeing it was right on target!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|A veritable Rock concert from beginning to end. It's hard to watch the new movies without your mind drifting back to the original (Wrath of Khan) but this was a great re-visitation of an already great flick. Benedict Cumberbatch is the ultimate villian. I can't imagine what's next.

B0000041LA|5.0|These discs were recorded in 1974-5 and were much liked as performances at that time. The choices as regards alternative sets were very limited then and Ashkenazy pretty well had the field all to himself. The recording was relatively bass-heavy and this tended to obscure much of the detail above and make the performances seem sonically dull. This has now been rectified on these new discs and the balance is now good as checked on three sets of reference playback equipment. As a result the performances sound much more lively than before.<br /><br />In the meanwhile there have been a number of alternative and fine sets made which can now be chosen from. The set with Bronfman has not been totally liked by critical opinion but the disc featuring concertos 2 and 4 can still be considered to be a fine pair of performances. Chandos made use of two pianists for their set and the disc featuring Gutierrez playing concertos 2 and 3 delivers very high powered virtuoso performances. The cadenza in the second concerto is notably impressive in that respect.<br /><br />Kun Woo Paik on Naxos shows complete empathy with the five concertos which are played with light-hearted relish, some humour and a willingness to scamper about the keyboard in a mischievous way. The recordings are all good and the accompaniment is also very good. This is a serious contender. So too is the  set with Krainev and Kitaenko. This is more powerful than Paik and has more of a 'Russian' feel about it. Technically and musically Krainev is right on top of these works and has an excellent accompanist and a fine recording. Beroff with Masur is also a main contender on a moderately priced EMI disc with Masur and the Leipzig orchestra in full support and in good sound too. (see my full reviews of those for more detail).<br /><br />As can be seen, choice for the current purchaser is much wider than back in 1974/5. I would suggest that Ashkenazy remains a front choice along with Kitaenko and Beroff. All three of these are good performances throughout and are offered in good sound and at reasonable prices. Potential purchasers would be well satisfied with any one or more of these three in particular with Paik being a most attractive runner-up.e are good performances throughout and are offered in good sound and at reasonable prices.

1416972250|3.0|The first book in the series was good. Not great - but for a YA book - it was good. After a long list of Blood sucking hero's (doesn't anyone else find this unhealthy obsession with bloodsuckers extremely gross. I avoid other people's DNA as much as possible). Anyway, back to my point- after the crazy assault of vampire fiction/genre it was refreshing to read a book based on humans with special powers.<br /><br />However, after the initial book - the remaining books were extremely childish. It was the teenage angst, cringe-worthy, soppy hearts and declarations (for goodness sakes - you're only 17!), and then everyone else shacking up, including the parents of these teenage knife wielding heroes. I think the author was hoping for ***aa[...] but instead I felt **eurgh***.<br />And lets not even get started with the incestuous relationship between certain characters.<br /><br />Magnus I just didn't understand. After 800 years - why would you want to be involved with an 18 year old? I'm not much older than an 18 year old and I find them far too young mentally. I also would most likely be far too superior to be concerned with silly affairs of the libido/heart by then. And just because a person has stopped ageing doesn't prevent them being a creep for hitting on a kid. The ending in this novel is ridiculous.<br /><br />Simon ought to have remained human.<br /><br />I skipped lots of pages and the ridiculous plot didn't; require me to read it. The author just didn't bother much with the remaining characters. Simon ought to have remained human- the whole vampire thing was stupid.<br /><br />Jace was hot. The flat chested, pale, skinny ginger was not. And that hasn't changed.<br /><br />======================<br /><br />***WARNING*** What should be considered a plot hole and a violent distortion of the Bible - Nephilim were NOT good soldiers fighting for humanity. In fact God ordered them to die. Although I'm not Christian I am uncomfortable with false information. It's alsounfair on Christians.<br /><br />more details on plot holes relating to the biblical references on this website:<br /><br />[...]

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I first heard if this book as it was recommended by Dr. Wayne Dyer on Facebook. Having studied for years and read many books of the subject of manifesting, co-creating, law of attraction (whatever you choose to call it) I was interested in why this book was being recommended by Dr. Dyer who himself had written 'Manifest Your Destiny', also a book on this subject matter. So I bought it... and I'm glad I did! Pam Grout is quite a character with a powerful understanding of how the universe works. I was glued to her words... even when she was speaking on things I already knew. She has a way of making this powerful (and sometimes heavy) information not only palatable to receive, but down right tasty. I highly recommend it! Buy it, read it, complete the experiments, and change your life!
1416955070|5.0|this is NOT sophisticated or well written. Doesn't manifest the secretive magical world very well, suffers gaping plot holes but it's utterly entertaining<br /><br />After a surfeit of Vampire NA/YA fiction out there I was momentarily surprised when this hit the big screens. I saw the trailer and was intrigued (particularly as the film features a Harry Potter star who is allowed to speak in his native accent).<br /><br />The story isn't sophisticated or well written. There are huge plot holes and the author didn't manifest the magic very well. It's no Diana Wynne Jones or Harry Potter. However, it's for teenagers and hence it's engrossing enough. However, I must say that this si the best book from the sequel and that it just gets worse.<br /><br />=============<br />The Characters<br />===Jace made this book. He's super hot. I'm not into 17 year olds but he's very mature with a rapier wit that's sexy. Additionally, he's not older than an octogenarian (I utterly despise the immortal hero types) hence this was rather refreshing.<br />If you enjoy hero's who aren't obsessive, lovey dovey \\"stare into her eyes\\" creeps than you will love Jace. He's sarcastic, tough, menacing and be rather harsh but he's hot.<br /><br />===Clary doesn't sound very pretty (although Lily Collins is beautiful) - what with the whole pale ginger skinny midget look, but she's not a \\"I will die if he doesn't love me\\" angst-y melodramatic teen either. She also fights back. I'm rather tired of finding (within NA) feeble minded heroines who lack a strong charismatic personality.<br /><br />===Simon is annoying and what happens to him is further annoying. There's huge plot holes relating to him. We're told no one knows about this terrifying secret paranormal world but suddenly Simon (and eventually his parents and so forth) will be part of this big bad secret.<br /><br />===Isabelle, Alec: semi ok characters. I think the author strives to portray them as louder than life but they don't remain consistent. Additionally, both are first introduced as having the hots for Jace but then we're told they consider him as sibling. Jeez.<br /><br />===Magnus is a tedious unimaginative character. A 700 year old immortal who still enjoys partys and stuff. Apparently he has not aged mentally or physically from 19. Eurgh.<br /><br />======<br />A few quotes from the book:<br /><br />He squinted at her. \\"Do you remember back at the hotel when you promised that if we lived, you'd get dressed up in a nurse's and give me a sponge bath?\\"\\"Actually, I think you misheard\\", Clary said. \\"It was Simon who promised you the sponge bath.\\" Jace looked involuntarily over at Simon, who smiled at him widely. \\"As soon as I'm back on my feet, handsome!\\" \\"I knew we should have left you a rat.\\"<br /><br />\\"That's why when major badasses greet each other in movies, they donn't say anything, they just nod. The nod means, 'I am a badass, and I recognize that you, too, are a badass.'\\"<br /><br />\\"Have you fallen in love with the wrong person yet?'<br />Jace said, \\"Unfortunately, Lady of the Haven, my one true love remains myself.\\"<br />...\\"At least,\\" she said, \\"you don't have to worry about rejection, Jace Wayland.\\"<br />\\"Not necessarily. I turn myself down occasionally, just to keep it interesting.\\"<br /><br />Don't.\\" Clary raised a warning hand. \\"I'm not really in the mood right now.\\"<br />\\"That's got to be the first time a girl's ever said that to me,\\" Jace mused.\\"<br /><br />======================<br /><br />***WARNING*** What should be considered a plot hole and a violent distortion of the Bible - Nephilim were NOT good soldiers fighting for humanity.

B000S57KVO|4.0|The first four songs are my favorites, and the album is peppered with some lovely jazz.  I would definitely recommend this album.
B005DD7H50|2.0|Great idea but the movie was terribly executed. I mean, come on...! You take a pill and 20 seconds later you are a freaking genius???! The plot development in the beginning was rushed. Bad acting and the ending is so stupid. It was entertaining but not a great movie at all.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was a very interesting insight on the near death experience of Dr Alexander. It gives you food for thought.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great Show can't wait for the fourth season,looking forward to seeing what happens now that Michael has been killed in the crash.  That is so sad!
B009GX69RK|3.0|I would give the show itself 5 stars but the streaming was terrible towards the end of the season, unfortunately!
140006922X|5.0|If you want to know the historical Jesus and the times he lived in, this book is for you. If you prefer to let others influence you with their prejudices, then maybe not.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|In true Mitch Albom fashion, you will walk away from this story with a new perspective on life.  You will learn about value of time and appreciating all you have! A great read!
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|This podcast app is a great way to get the podcasts you would normally be able to get on an apple device but for a non-apple device.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Not much I can say other than wow what a great cd from some of the best in the business who would have though that you could put these guys together and get this masterpiece.Very well written songs and performed great with each guy showcasing their talent.I really can't say enough about how much I love it if you are thinking of buying any new music I recommend this it will not disappoint.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I recently got a new tv and blu ray player so now I'm beginning a small collection with only the best of the best movies, this set was high up on the list
B00DCRE83S|5.0|If you heard the EP then you knew what to expect but in my opinion it is way better than I expected.I really love it if you ever heard Jason perform Seek and Destroy live with Metallica you know he can deliver a menacing vocal and to me Metallica just is not the same without him Robert is a great player but he is not Jason.Here Jason shines I really don't have any complaints although I would have loved to hear the guitar solo's more prominent but that's just my opinion the real heavy tracks are the ones I love most but there are no bad songs here.Would I recommend this album definetly you won't be disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy playing the free tournament games every morning ; then get my credits in the evening.  I really enjoy playing this game.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|What a great cd,Tom took his time and delivered a really great Blues/Rock cd and I am sure all the Cinderella fans out there will love it.
B00AHGSVKS|3.0|A book that starts with a much bigger idea than it actually turns out to be. I guess appropriate for the time it was written and enjoyable enough but not the ending I would have written were it up to me. Although the ending was bleak (which I do enjoy), it was a bit goofy and the idea takes away from humanity's individuality which I would have preferred it steered towards rather than away from. Overall, a C++<br /> And just so you know, I have only gotten into science fiction over the last few years, were it up to this book it may have taken me longer.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Great read! Witty writing much like Thomas Wolfe, author of &#34;Bonfire or the Vanities. I could not put this book down.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This story would be great for young adult readers that enjoy interesting what-if Sci-Fi.  I prefer Isaac Asimov's novels more than Card's.  I would have enjoyed a little more detail regarding events leading up to this story, but I understand that there are prequels out now, so that may help.  Will hopefully enjoy the movie after having read the book.
B008CLI4N4|1.0|I had been looking forward to watching this and I still am, however the first problem was having to collect it from the post office myself to pay the outstanding customs fee of £13 then when I got it home I found that it wasn't compatible with my DVD player region.<br />It was clear that the order was for the UK and I think that it should be mentioned when ordering that the DVD will not suit some regions, which should then be listed.<br />I am in the process of returning the DVD and hope that my money will be reimbursed without any further problems.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cute and fun game love my horse. Easy to use and understand. Good clean fun and enjoyment. Thank you for a good game .
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Cute game and entertaining.  Just about the time you think you are going to win a surprise move pops up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. The area I live in has no space for horses, so to have the ability to own a horse of my own through the app is a dream come true
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Love this game.  It is very challenging and when you win it is a good feeling.  Really makes you think about how to solve the problem.  Love it!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|This was a much needed break from the usual programming. For those of us who always dreamed of being a Karen Cartwright, this was so much fun to watch. If you are a fan of musicals, backstage drama, and great songs, you will love this.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Interesting to read about the meaning of different flowers and also to get insights into the emotional problems of those kids who come out of the foster care system.
B009GXHOW4|2.0|Mine worked once that's it I can't do squat I've tried lots of times but it won't work I'm thinking of deleting it
B009KS4XRO|5.0|i love this game! I play it everyday, sometimes all day long, got to get off this computer, lol lol
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|This was a great romp that dipped into the old story line as it saw fit, playing with what we remember, but not reproducing it verbatim. If I had to say anything bad about it, I'd have to say that it wasn't as gritty as the first one. There was a raw quality to the their first movie that they seem to have polished out of this one.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|It was okay. But it wasn't great. I am not a fan of remakes really are they done well and are never exciting to watch, Colin Farrell was okay, the other leads were okay, but I know a film is not good when I can't remember any of the characters' names - it's funny how I still remember the names of all the leads from 'Blade Runner'...
B00DP3IESY|4.0|If you like Tom Cruise, you'll like this movie. It's him playing a familiar character that we have grown to love. The story is solid and the cinematography is beautiful. Definitely worth a look.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Omg you must get app I rate 5 stars follow me {ToniPepproni} I am on it when I am not busy I am on pinterest
B005LJITKI|5.0|I loved this movie!  They must not have advertised this much when it first came out, because I had not been aware of this movie.  BUT they should have!  One of the most hilarious movies that I have seen.  I laughed from beginning to end.  All the actors were spot on for their specific characters.
1609611543|5.0|This book was a real eye opener and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get serious about their health and losing weight.  I started following the wheat belly diet a little less than a month ago and have already lost 14lbs. To my amazement my cravings have completely diminished and I no longer feel hungry all the time.  Dr. Davis explains how the proteins/gliadins in todays wheat are so detrimental to our health and cause us to be on a constant roller coaster of sugar addiction. I have completely changed my way of thinking about the food I eat and only hope that others would have the same ah-ha moment that I did after reading this book.  It's a must read!
B00846REIS|5.0|Fast reading...love the story line..I can not wait to start the next book and read what is ahead for both character...
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Everything I thought it would be I'm I'm a huge fan of the show, it got here quickly.  No  complaints
1452126577|5.0|I liked how the book was a parody about grumpiness and how to become grumpy as seen through the eyes of Grumpy Cat, aka Tarter Sauce.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is a great game. The only problem I have is when you try to add Facebook friends sometimes you get an error but for the most part a very great app
B0097EWK3A|3.0|I like these kinds of games, but i was expecting more as it seems that it should carry on as the killer haven't been caught.<br /><br />Is there a concluding part.<br />Thanks<br />R. Kitcher
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a wonderful show - very well made and all the actors play so well. I really love watching every episode!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVED this game can not wait for more. It was very challenging until I got the hang of the clues.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. It is so interesting. I love the time period that this cover. It is very interesting.
B009XPGJYY|5.0|The story line is great, it's different from anything out there can't wait for season 5 to come out in instant video
B008RXYOKY|5.0|If you need this cable, then you kind of have to buy it because it's kind of specific, and the only one.  So once you buy it, you just have to hope it works.  It does.  So there you go.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I love this game because there are many free characters each week I can't say the meny reasons but check it out;)
B000UZNSWM|5.0|This is typical Halberstam...meticulous research combined with a readability that few historians can match.  I came cose to crying at several points.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this as it gives me theweather for wherever I would like to know about. having family spread around in different countrys I like to keep up with what is happening in their part of the world and can see their weather at a glance as well as what to expect at home. very easy and simple to use for an old codger like me.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|While I wish the expansion was available, this is a nice version.<br /><br />The game play is fast and it is possible to get a game finished in 10-12 minutes if you don't waste time.<br /><br />It also has a lot of mini-challenges that give you something to shoot for.
0670026557|5.0|After an hour of looking through this book, I gave it to my 20 year old son who is a student studying the psychology of business: such topics as the psychology of entrepreneurship, of risk taking and investing and personnel management.  He gobbled it up and took it back to school with him.  I noticed him highlighthing several paragraphs.  I'll have to buy myself another copy.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|This was a recommendation from my Real Simple magazine so I thought, why not.  Well I started reading it and couldn't put it down.
B001NA6096|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film, especially for its simplicity and realism. The character development was great and the premise of the movie sweet and thought provoking.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|maybe the third time around was too much of the same thing<br />i liked it but there were times i wasn't going to finish it<br /><br />i liked it but the first book was more exciting, new and different
B005BGBPBG|4.0|This movie depicted what I imagined when reading the book. Good rom-com, can't go wrong with the actors and actresses chosen for the characters.
159463176X|5.0|Liked this book very much. Had little time & thought I would skim it before Book Club. WRONG! I could not put it down & finished in one sitting. Wish that I had taken notes on names/locations. It all came together in the end but I got confused as to which Abdullah & which Parsi in which era was the subject. My fault.<br />I'm a Housseini fan & I was not disappointed.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My husband loves this show.  So glad we are able to see it, even though we are behind the current season.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it soo much! way better than the first one. I really really really hope they come out with a third one.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this movie.  On the one hand, it is a really scary and intense monster movie. On the other hand, some of the scenes and footage are uninteresting, badly put together, and seemingly unnecessary.  The premise is that a monster attacks Manhattan and the whole movie is supposed to be the video evidence of a young man who filmed the event. So, as it is entirely from the POV of the guy with the video camera, it is naturally jumpy and chaotic footage to watch.  The first half hour of the movie is just footage of this camera guy, his girlfriend and their group of friends, just hanging out and doing the usual college friends kind of things. Then, the action begins when they see an explosion across town and flaming debris come flying towards them. From there, they spend the rest of the time running around in a panic, trying to escape the area or investigate the catastrophe - sometimes, it's unclear which of these they are doing.  It is not until the head of the statue of liberty comes flying through the air and lands on the street in front of them that they start to be aware of the monster... though some people just gawk and photograph the head, instead of looking in the other direction where danger is approaching.  Some of the so-called footage is unrealistic - such as when they rescue their friend from her hi-rise apartment building (which is in ruins and falling down), the camera guy continues to film instead of helping or holding on for dear life as they make their way out of the trecherous wreckage.  And when the camera guy actually gets attacked by the monster, the camera is still filming... presumably within the jaws of the creature and even when his body is dropped to the ground.  It even continues filming when they are in a helicopter crash.  If you can accept the premise that anyone could actually keep a video camera in tact and working throughout this whole ordeal, then it makes the movie work, despite certain unrealistic moments.  The creature is a cross between a giant crustacean and a giant lizard... very imaginatively created. It has the added terror of shedding what seems to be its hatched young all over the place... these are small, spider-like versions of the larger creature. On the whole, this is a pretty good monster movie, though with the disappointment of no explanations as to what the creature is, where it comes from, or why it's suddenly attacking Manhattan.  The viewer is left with many questions because the film ends when the two surviving young people are hiding in a tunnel and summarize what has happened to them for the sake of \\"anyone who finds this camera\\".  I enjoyed most of the movie, it was very scary and suspenseful - for the most part.  But, as much as I did enjoy it, I have to add that it is the sort of forgettable monster movie I may not ever watch again.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|I love everything Lady Gaga does. She is an Amazing inspiration to me. Applause is a Powerful & an Amazing song as is everything she has done & continue to do :-)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The story is very well written and the production is extremely well-done.  The filming and acting is superbly executed and convincingly presented to the audience.  Thanks for your making available to your Prime subscribers.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I like this game and I can't find a problem with , except that you have to buy bling  to get enough to pass a lot levels at the end of the game the best part is that you don't need to have Facebook to get friends on this game :)
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|watched it with hubby ..it was much fun.i am a gamer but it got me away from the game :-)
B006YTYIXG|2.0|I'm not talking about the music, if you're a fan of Soulfly you will enjoy it because it's more of the same; but the design and packaging of these album are terrible. A crappy, cheap cardboard digipack without a place for holding the booklet, that will fall if you open or just grab the case. Go and buy the normal version with the plastic jewel case, because this one is really, really bad!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|The problem I find for most people when it comes to Kanye West--outside of his alliance with a certain shameless reality TV family, his ego and his ability to say the wrong thing at the wrong time--is that Kanye West is a black musician, a \\"rapper,\\" but he doesn't fit the mold. West doesn't make R&B or hip hop; he makes music, music that transcends genres, stereotypes and labels. He is a true artist and that is on display with his latest effort, YEEZUS.<br /><br />I haven't always been a Kanye fan; while I enjoyed \\"[[ASIN:B000VZPF2W Gold Digger (Album Version (Edited)) [feat. Jamie Foxx]]\\" simply because it was a summer anthem and tolerated \\"[[ASIN:B000VZEWIU Stronger]]\\" because it was in heavy rotation, I didn't pay much attention to his music until his infamous 2009 VMA incident. Afterwards, I picked up [[ASIN:B004BSIJ9Q My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (Explicit Version)]] out of curiosity and was hooked. I furthered my knowledge with his Jay-Z collaboration [[ASIN:B005GRUPCK Watch The Throne (Deluxe Edition) [Explicit]]]. I am and have always been a fan of Jay-Z's, but artistically, his protege outweighs his current efforts. Whereas Jay-Z has become a slave to the production (and has allowed it to overpower his lyrics), Kanye--who has never been one for intricate verses--balances it out nicely on YEEZUS, but veers from the traditional rap/hip hop elements into too many territories to name.<br /><br />YEEZUS is brilliant. It's a masterpiece: \\"Blood on the Leaves,\\" \\"Guilt Trip\\" and \\"Bound 2\\" are some of my favorites, though the whole album is a journey. I don't think of myself as a versed critic when it comes to music, but (in my humble opinion), I feel my ears know when something is good and YEEZUS, for all of its banging and clashing and polarizing, is GOOD. I think history will judge it for what it is and the masses will catch up. This is one time where I can say that Kanye's ego IS backed by his talent.

B007VDN1PA|4.0|I had an HP scanner that I liked very well but no one provided drives for it of Windows 7. I was very unhappy. I got another cheap on that was more bother that it was worth. I will be honest, I wasn't expecting that much when I purchased this one. It was less costly than the cheap one that I had gotten previously. However, It works fine and it is just what I needed. I would recommend it to anyone who has slides and negatives.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game for all ages. Easy to play and advance. Enjoyable for the whole family. Play daily credits reachable even kids can play. Several worlds and levels daily tournament
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Whether you are a McCartney fan or a &#34;standards&#34; fan, you're going to love this.  Great music to have on during a dinner party for just about any age group.  I have given this as a gift for people in the 40s and their 80s.  I received it as a hostess gift for a Valentine party.  Perfect!
0140186395|3.0|waited over 2 wks,<br />book was fine, and I could make notes in it.<br />I would order a book in the same way in the future
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Because of the way this movie is being released on Blu-ray, I have canceled my order.  Borrowed from IO9:<br />The official Blu-ray has seven mini-featurettes. Paramount has divvied up all the other features -- including the commentary tracks with the cast and director J.J. Abrams, and several additional featurettes -- have been given exclusive to the Target release, the Best Buy release, and the iTunes download. Meaning 1) if you buy the normal version you're getting less than half the special features created for the home video release, and 2) if you want all of them you're going to need to purchase at least three separate versions.<br /><br />I want the extras, but to split things up like this, I will not buy.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|In my opinion, this is possibly the best of Dan Brown's books. The premise  behind the story is very believable. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, believable thriller.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Addicting and frustrating.  Great spin on an old school classic.  I need more upgrade points to keep going to new levels.
B008602KQI|4.0|I like to read the book before seeing the show and then decide but since I have only seen bits and pieces of it, I can't really give a true review....maybe when the snow flies I will  have more time to sit and watch. I liked what I have seen.
B005K17RU0|4.0|More info about the day's weather than you will need. It  sometimes takes a long time to load. Hourly info is helpful.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book brings the lives of teenagers suffering from cancer into focus. The characters are beautifully drawn and compelling, right down to their often morbid senses of humor. I think I fell in love with Augustus. I confess to reading the last 20% with tears dripping down my face, but it was well worth the soggy tissues.
B000YDOOUK|1.0|my order was delivered late, the jewel case was damaged upon receipt, and track 7 skips after repeated attempts at cleaning the disk. the music is fine but a bit one dimensional...good rock but the songs sound the same. comparing them to def leppard and ac/dc is not appropriate. biggest frustration is with the condition of the cd...my bad on the selection of an average album.
B001EBWING|5.0|Casablanca, though filmed in black & white format, has very colorful characters and follows the main personalities through the myriad nuances of:  two lovers who previously were ships that passed in the night only to meet again years later and be faced with learning more of the truth about how they were separated and how do they resolve the conflicts of their present situations; two different yet similar men who become close acquaintances in the midst of a war torn world and end up doing the right thing under dangerous circumstances; various other players who find themselves needing to trust each other under complicated scenarios and yet for some death will result; the realization for some that patriotism may come with some level of cost just as freedom is hardly ever free.<br /><br />These are fairly universal and timeless issues that confront many of us to some degree today as we go about our daily lives.<br /><br />Plus, what guy wouldn't relish having the opportunity to say:  &#34;Here's looking at you kid&#34; to a beautiful lady like Ingrid Bergman?
B0091V6TF4|5.0|All of a sudden you will think you're cool, thin, rich, good-looking and driving something you can't afford, sitting next to someone you can't afford.<br />Much better to listen to alone at home in your best panties.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|As a lifetime Star Trek fan, this movie was extremely disappointing. Even worse than the first...<br /><br />The new direction Abrams is taking the franchise is just sad. We have yet another incarnation of Klingons... and somehow an altered timeline has turned Ricardo Montalban's character into a white englishman.<br /><br />Who Mourns for Adonais? :c
B00A8ECU24|1.0|this game may be free on the surface and it might be enjoyable in parts, but if you want to get anywhere with the quests you will either have to play 10 years straight or spend lots of real money (i've personally spent $30+.)
B0071MQBX0|5.0|What a delight watching this and enjoying it all over again.  It was spectacular! At a time when the world is so troubled it was a calming and uplifting and much needed for the soul.
0375812024|5.0|Both my sons love this book, ages 2 and 1. As soon as they see it one of them will bring it over to be read and the other always follows. There are so many things/vehicles to look at and talk about. Often I don't read all the text, which is a little silly. Instead we talk about the illustrations and ask questions. I just ordered a second copy of the book to replace our original, which is completely worn out!

B009RX8AQW|4.0|ABC Studios gives fairy tale lovers a wonderful gift with the release of \\"Once Upon a Time: The Complete Second Season.\\" The 5-disc box set features all 22 episodes and a satisfying amount of special features for those looking for a peek behind the curtain. The show continues to spin a complex web of intrigue and fantasy in its sophomore year.<br /><br />The curse is broken and magic has come to Storybrooke. The citizens of the town now remember who they were in Fairy Tale Land.

They constantly switch between Fairy Tale World and the present-day town of Storybrooke to keep things interesting. Where some shows may feel crowded with too many characters, that isn't the case here. Each person fits into the different plotlines and contributes what they need to.<br /><br />New special guest stars are always popping up on \\"Once Upon a Time.\\" In Season Two, we get some interesting talent showing up. Rose McGowan, Ethan Embry, and Elizabeth Hershey are a few of them. Elizabeth Hershey and Rose McGowan both play Regina's mother, Cora, at different ages. They couldn't be more perfect for the deliciously evil role. They give the character an emotional depth and motivation which make you feel sorry for and despise her all at the same time.<br /><br />Whether you've seen the show in HD or just regularly broadcast, \\"Once Upon a Time: The Complete Second Season\\" is a delight to see on Blu-ray.

B00005JMJG|5.0|I love this movie, it is very good and makes you think hard about what is going on. Details are crucial to pay attention to.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I recommend this movie to those who love the Marvel series, especially those who want context for the Avenger movie.
146920231X|4.0|I have been wanting to read the book for 15 years - put it off way too long. The contents and delivery of the information inspired me to make several changes in my financial outlook. Funny enough ... it wasn't as mind blowing to me as I expected. But I do know that each of my children will be asked to read this before college. Richard has amazing insight - not like anyone didn't already know that.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|This movie has the best in actors and their chemistry makes the whole movie.  Good but not great story line.  Hope Red2 is better.
B009AY04A8|5.0|love the game, wish it was longer. I will be glad when part 2 comes out. I don't recommend everyone do this but it was good entertainment between rounds at work.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|entertaining and challenging! one of the best games I have played yet in the search and find category. i cant wait to finish it so I can do another from g5
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The best weekly series on television.  It's like two series in one.The fascinating lives of the aristocracy upstairs and the drama that goes on downstairs with the help. If you've never seen Downton Abby you have to get the first series, you will never leave your seat!
B000RFPORM|5.0|Honestly I do believe it is the best movie ever made.  Obviously subjective, there were so many film techniques introduced in this film that are still used today, and they are still fresh (mostly) in this film.  The story is a masterpiece of self-reflexivity and introspection.<br /><br />It would be wise to read a synopsis of the film prior to the first viewing of it, otherwise you may be lost and frustrated the first time through.  I first saw this over 20 years ago and it's still relevant (though now I generally just watch specific scenes).
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Not very good, I'm sorry to say. The choices it gives it limited and most times the video does not come  on. It could definitely benefit from a  redo.I was being generous by giving it 3 stars.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is by far the best battery app iI have ever used. It is very easy to understand. Easy to navigate. It covers all of your battery questions. I highly recommend this app.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I surprised my wife with this movie, it is her favorite movie (Very beautiful and heart felt / strong & powerful)
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|It's getting harder and harder to watch Bruce Willis &#34;Die Hard&#34;. I'm not sure I would watch a Die Hard with Jai Courtney as the &#34;new&#34; John McClane if that is what they were gunning for. Bruce is more enjoyable and more fun to watch in movies like RED and RED 2.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game so much, I accidentally uninstalled it and don't even mind starting over!  Highly recommend this to any solitaire lover!
B003SI3URQ|4.0|This is no Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast, but far better than its outings with Mulan and Pocahontas.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|My 5 year old asked me to load the game on his Nabi 2 tablet, so I thought I'd test it first. He loved it!  Only downside, the real app is seemingly incompatible with the tablet.  Don't understand why you'd be allowed to test an app on a gadget that's not compatible with the full version, so save yourself from your child's angst.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|A little bit slow moving, but you expect that. It was a real pleasure to watch and I was especially pleased to see that the actors were also actual retired performers.  Nice touch.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I was so excited to get past the point in this book where season 3 of Game of Thrones ended to see what happens! Martin does not disappoint! I never saw some of these things coming! I can't wait to read the next one!!!
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|Tried to use it on most of the 140 plus levels and the hints didn't help. I found better and more up to date help online.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|Great for my job when I am on a call away from my truck or other power source.  Keeps my phone charged all day for multiple calls and usage.  Have yet to deplete the battery and the adapters allow other phones to be charged as well.  Quality product.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Bought this for my wife's car.  We're using this in conjunction with [[ASIN:B00C28L6EW AmazonBasics USB Cable - 2.0 A Male to Micro B (3 Feet / 0.9 Meters), 2 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B009SYZ8OC AmazonBasics USB A to Lightning Compatible Cable (3 Feet/0.9 Meter)]] to charge my wife's iPhone 5 and my Galaxy S3 while we're on the road.  It's great being able to charge two phones at the same time at full capacity.  One port outputs 2.1A while the other outputs 1.5A (3.6A max)...more than enough for either phone.  I went with this particular product because of the 2.1A output of one of the ports in case we ever needed to charge a tablet that requires that much.<br /><br />Works great so far.  The charger stays put fairly well in the socket.  I did notice that I can wiggle the charger somewhat while it's plugged in.  When I wiggle it, I can hear the charging notification sound from our phones chiming, which means that the charger stopped charging and then started charging again.  This tells me that the charger can lose connection with the car's socket if wiggled by hand.  However, it doesn't fall out or anything while driving and it never seemed to lose connection or power if I left it alone.  My Verizon charger for my phone fits perfectly in the car's socket and can't be wiggled.<br /><br />This alone is the reason I deducted 1 star.  It's really only a half-star deduction.  Again, I love that I can get full charging from both ports simultaneously.  I had always read about some of these other dual-port chargers that can only charge two devices simultaneously if you crack it open and solder two point.  Not necessary to do for this device and it's priced better than those other ones that require it while outputting more power.  Winner!
B00425S1H8|4.0|After a quick setup I was able to hook up to the control systems.  Have used over 10 times without a glitch.
B00338QENI|5.0|I loved this book. The story of this family is so interesting and gives us a peek, once again, into the life in the fifties...especially the poor and black. And the story of Henrietta's cells is simply amazing!
B001XUPF2O|4.0|ENjoyed the movie.  Good acting.  Good action.<br />Christian Bail is a great actor.<br /><br />wonder how Ben Afflack will be.  We shall see
B00DQAM5LI|4.0|Upon first hearing Hail To The King, the most obvious realization is what this album lacks. It lacks the progressive lead guitar driven crazy twisting and turning instrumentals. However for the most part, A7X makes up for the more simple song structure by increasing the epic vocals, catchy riffs and balanced tracks.<br /><br />Not every band conforms to mainstream metal as well as A7X has in this album. What I hear, is what most hard rock/ popular metal fans can listen to and enjoy. Out is the epic hardcore instrumental, in is the melodic, riff based vocally intense style that Metallica made popular with the Black Album. Yet, despite distinct Megadeth (Shepard of Fire), Metallica (This Means War), GNR (Doing Time, Acid Rain = November Rain?) influences, A7X still shines through; mostly in Syn's soloing and the tracks Heretic and Coming Home, which are my favorites.<br /><br />That is not to say I don't miss A7X. In fact I miss them a lot. I give all their previous albums 5 stars and this one 4 because although I still enjoy it, it is not the A7X I know and love.<br /><br />Mike Portnoy, what did you do to this band? Dream Theater cast you out as you sought to compromise their musical identity, and now you have taken these naive vulnerable yet technically adept musicians and shown them how easy they can produce acceptable music?  Nothing about this album is a must hear. A7X please go back to the intricate prog metal you were so close to being a staple in.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love the minions from Despicable Me, and clearly I am not alone in this opinion. I've only played a few rounds in this game, but it is fun, lively, and good for any age. Using simple swipe controls (Kindle Fire), you navigate your minion through a hazardous path trying to avoid obstacles and collect bananas. You do not control the speed, only the direction of the minion. Great fun!
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|One of my very favorite films; from the crazy almost unbelievable plot, to the even crazier characters.  This is not a movie to be missed if you like to laugh at the odd things in life.
1594744769|4.0|My husband gave me this book (thank  you David ) - and I finished it in two sittings ( I had to make myself stop reading to spread out the pleasure ).  It was strange, touching, a bit scary and left me wanting more  - a good thing since there is a sequel coming. The story of an ordinary boy who is not , in the end all that ordinary made for a really good read. And those photographs-buy it and see for yourselves.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Great Story: Great Acting:  Language was a hurdle.  Understand why it won best picture.  Consider sequel or maybe even a prequel.
0307346617|5.0|Wow, this book is a story telling master piece.  If you ever wondered what the world would be like if there was a Zombie apocalypse and mankind's resilience then this is the book for you.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love the characters though sometimes the story seems farfetched or the plot twists a little too convenient. I think it would be far more compelling if the Crawleys really would have gone broke and had to learn to live like commoners.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Addicting. I may have to move to England so I don't have to wait so long for Season Four.  One exception:Seriously UNhappy with last episode.  Spoiler: That character was too interesting, handsome, intelligent and important to DA's success to exit.  Grave error on writer's part.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is definitely the type of show you want to purchase a whole season at a time. Once you start watching you don't want to stop.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Not Oscar quality storyline, but, for a first time actor, Gina did a terrific job.  Her 'tough girl', no-nonsense work ethic struck achord with me.  When my wife and I first saw the movie in the theater, and saw how she took care of the 'bad guys', I told her &#34;she's had training!&#34;  Later we looked her up on the internet, and saw a video of her actual MMA fights.  Not just a guy movie for the action, but can be considered a girl movie, too,  for how she does her job.  Look out Mr. Schwartzenegger!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Many alarm choices and several alarms to set and options for days and repeats. It's a great app.<br /><br />It has a nice choice of musical versus beeping/ringing alarms.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written, filmed & acted! Transported me to that to time. I still find myself thinking about them & looking forward to the next season.
0061537969|5.0|I was very impressed with how quicky I receieved the book.  I waited to late to order the item and it was supposed to be a gift but it came so quickly I was able to give the gift in the right time frame.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched the whole season in 1 day. I love this series.Once you start watching the first season you will fall in love<br />with many of the characters. The costumes are gorgeous.The mansion they all live in is like a town within itself....<br />Pop some popcorn put up our feet and enjoy the show!
B00DLKXF3A|1.0|I was really looking forward to this album. However, once i got it and started listening to it I was very disappointed. Overall the album is very boring and dull. The best song on the whole album is hail to the king and that song is already over played on the radio. Nothing like their previous albums, dont waste your money.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This was a quick read and a good accounting of life with Alzheimer's in fast speed. A some point some things didn't ring true and I realized it wasn't a true story.  I still enjoyed it, felt the struggle of the family and learned a few more things to take back to real life.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book was so sappy and unbelievable.  The author uses virtually every potential sob-story known to man -- along with a heavy and relatively explicit theme of sexual exploitation of children that I realize was a true issue for religious orphanages decades ago, but absolutely did not fit with the rest of the corniness of the book.  I did smile a time or two due to a couple of the humorous lines of one of the main characters, which again was almost perverse given some of the brutality in some of the parts, but I was probably generous by giving it a '3' rating.
0783230079|5.0|I could not pass owning this movie on DVD. It is light hearted, and imaginative. Probably would classify it as a chick-flick, but fun watching. The seller was prompt, and the item arrived in a timely fashion.<br />ft
B004EPZ034|5.0|Bought for my granddaughter.  She gets so excited to watch The Chipmunks.  Great Movie for kids of all ages, Thanks
0060531053|5.0|A great, fun guide to start the art of Home-brewing couldn't have asked for a better book. I definitely recommend.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I liked the movie, but it took two viewings before it made sense.  I like the actors that were cast in the various roles.
B00138KCC4|5.0|One of my first albums that I ever picked up as a teenager. I will always love this album. Amazing song's, powerful lyrics, this album will keep you headbanging throughout.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Excellent movie.  I am sure that extracting people from a dangerous situation in a foreign country happen  more often than not.  There were many times that I held my breathe and hoped that the people would get out
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|I think after I read this short book I hugged my dog for two hours strait. This book will warm every dog lovers heart (maybe even Cat lovers) and make you spoil that little brat you have in your house. Definitely recommend.
0545265355|5.0|This is a good story written in three different books.  I can hardly wait for the book two movie to come out in November. 2013.  I do hope that they will make a movie of book three also.
B005MW5CWW|5.0|One of Mastadon's best! I was really nervous going into this album because I was worried how they would follow up Crack the Skye. My worries were laid to rest, It's an amazing followup! More mellow than what they are used to but it's great that they are expanding as a band. Love them! Would recommend!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|His books were better when Clancy wrote them himself, instead of with a co-author.  He gets too wordy at times.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You just can't go wrong with Downton Abbey - the t's are crossed and the i's are dotted. One doesn't watch it... one lives it.
B009AMANBA|3.0|The movie was Ok, but it sort of dragged on and on.  The actors that played the characters of the movie were excellent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book it was amazing I couldn't put it down! I read it in 3 days. You will love it
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the first two books and couldn't wait to read the third book. I liked the book but felt it was dragged out to long and there are going to be more follow up books it's definitely not a trilogy
B007HACDLK|5.0|Outstanding!! Wish I had started reading Vince Flynn before his death. I plan to read all of his novels. A great author.
B0067TQQI8|3.0|At the time of purchase there was an issue where the proper picture wasn't shown so I returned it. It also looked as if the product was refurbished since the plastic was melted away.<br />After the refund was credited back I bought the Anker 15,000 mAh along with the Anker AC adapter to cut down on charging the battery.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Not only do i love this movie and i am obssesed with it. I was super excited when i found it for the awesome low price.. Very fast shipping awesome seller couldn't be happier!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love it!  I've watched all 3 seasons twice!!  I'm sure that I will watch it one more time before Season 4 begins.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Our whole family loves this movie.  We watch it every once in a while just to enjoy the antics of the characters.  The frosting on top is that we occasionally go to Astoria where this was filmed and see the jail, house, and coastline.  It just brings on happy memories.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My daughter had to read this book for school and I thought I should read it too.  It was amazing and perfect for junior high students who struggle with their own self image. I would highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I purchased Chromecast directly from Google.  The idea is great.  The execution not so much.  I don't need this for Netflix since I have Roku.  I was hoping this would be a good way to look at You Tube on the big screen.  Perhaps in another release.  For now, it is not worth the trouble.  The process is problem laden.  The casting icon does not always appear on your You Tube screen.  And when it does appear, the casting is not always successful.<br /><br />Perhaps another day.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I have zero complaints about this case. It has kept the headset clean, and undamaged when it has been tossing around in my messenger bag. With the exception of one time, which was entirely my fault, it has always ensured that my headset is charged and ready to go when I need it.<br />The exception that I mentioned above, was that I put the headset away while still turned on and when I went to use it, like a week or two later it was dead...like I said entirely my fault.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Been listening to Sammy Hagar since his Montrose days.<br /><br />If you are a Hagar fan you will like this album.<br /><br />If you like good high energy rock n roll with catchy riffs you will enjoy this album.<br /><br />Sammy is not just going through the motions and this album reflects that.<br /><br />The band is solid across the board with a great bass line and backup vocals from Michael Anthony, great guitar riffs from Joe Satriani and solidly anchored by Red Hot Chili Pepper drummer Chad Smith.<br /><br />Bottom line this is a solid effort by the Red Rocker who is still clearly having fun doing what he loves to do - good for him.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We like Homeland so much we had to watch all the DVD's in one night. Anxious for Season 2to be available
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book arrived quickly and was a great price.  I loved it! The shipper was great and the book was amazing.
140006922X|5.0|Zeolot was not an easy book to write , I'm sure, as the subject matter is dense and deeply involved. It was, however, an easy book to read considering the material. It was formatted in an easy to follow manner and presented in an extremely professional well thought out manner.
B009DKFSUA|1.0|Am not happy....i did order, but didn't mean to get something could'nt play around my family....grandchildren...Think the beat and party sound is good, but alas, not able to really enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me and my whole family love the game.It's sometimes hard and hard.I like it and I like you can get different characters.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show keeps you yearning for more.  A great drama for all to enjoy.  Can't wait for season 4 to start.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|THIS app is fun,addictive but a little confusing. Still trying to figure the objective but for free I can deal with it.  Seems like there's a lot of different scenes to explore but you have to keep earning gold,crystals &amp; energy. .
B009NY43NY|5.0|Outstanding! This was a great read and as an avid Sookie Stackhouse reader I am very pleased with the ending!

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I First Saw This Film On STARZ Cable Network.  I Didn't Think I'd Like But Quite The Opposite Came True, I Liked It So Much That I Went On Purchased The Blu-Ray And Striked My Curiousity To Watch The Original TRON...
B00CATSONE|3.0|This is ok for free. However, it's not in depth and does not really do much to explain Tesla's genius. If you've never heard of him this is an easy an introduction. It's a fine treatise on how difficult  it is to introduce disruptively better technology in the face of opposing business interests invested in the status quo.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|I Never Had Seen The Original TRON When It Was In Theatres Back In '82, However I Did Go See E.T., Go Figure - I Was Only 11yrs Old.  Having Seen TRON Legacy I Was Curious To Watch The Original On Blu-Ray.  The Picture Quality Of The Blu-Ray For Such An Old Film Is Surprisingly Good.  The Whole Idea Of The Premise Of TRON Looking Back Through Today's Eyes You Can See How The Writers And Producers Were Visionaries.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Awesome game to play please and rate this game and if u don't I will be mad and sad so rate
B001EBWINQ|5.0|I really liked the ending... not at all what I expected would happen. This movie is definitely an oldie but goodie.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|I saw this in the theaters initially and found this to be a very interesting story.  The one thing that bothered me was, after looking up the true story, the Canadians were much more involved in this than merely hosting the Americans at the embassy, but nonetheless, the film is still very enjoyable.
B005D6O0IO|4.0|These shoes are very functional, since I'm mostly outdoors. A little slippery on wet concrete, but love that they are stylish enough to wear anywhere.
1442499656|4.0|Rating:  3.5 stars<br /><br />I've long had my eye on City of Bones.  The cover is eye catching and the plot sounds interesting.  My lingering hesitance is part of my usual dilemma, will the story be more adventure or angst.  With the movie release upon us, it is time to make that decision . . . to read or not read?<br /><br />I am glad that I chose to read.  There are certainly hints of teen angst here and there, but the story is directed mostly by adventure and world-building.  Hurrah!  I admit that the plot is on the predictable side, but the entertaining manner in which the story unfolds makes it almost possible to overlook.<br /><br />The basic premise is one we've seen before, kind of an Alice through the Looking Glass kind of tale.  The world-building has elements that make it unique enough to hold the readers interest.  The story follows Clary, an impetuous teen whose mother goes missing just when she starts to see inexplicable things.  She is seeing demons to be precise.  It turns out that everywhere.  Fortunately for her, she meets a band of teenage demon hunters who grudgingly agree to help her find her mom and figure out what is happening to her.<br /><br />I am not sure that it makes sense that a group of teen demon hunters are the only ones around to protect the city for the duration of the book.  Reader have to make a leap of faith to just accept this a move on.  Because of their youthful exuberance, the teen characters are fun, if one-dimensional.  Some of them have secrets, and I'm not telling!  I want to tell you, truly I do, but I think it would be more fun it you discover them on your own.<br /><br />My favorite character, Magnus Bane, is a minor character of importance to the story.  He is extremely powerful and totally unapologetic.  The ambiguity of his character allows Ms. Clare a vehicle through which she can deliver truth, in a crazy-cool kind of way.  I also love Valentine as a villain.  He is psychotically brilliant and totally arrogant.  Oh, and in the movie he's played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Hello, sexy calling!).<br /><br />Clare relies more on intrigue rather than action to move the story forward.  This is not to say that there are no good action scenes, there are.  It is just the mystery is solved more Sherlock style, piecing together clues gained through investigation.<br /><br />This is a good first book to the series.  It was a solid introduction to the characters and the Clare's alternate world.  The resolution to the primary plot is strong enough to give closure, yet there are there are plenty of tantalizing open threads to entice the reader back for more.  So, go on now, dear reader.  I have another book (City of Ashes) to read.Oh, and in the movie he's played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Hello, sexy calling!).<br /><br />Clare relies more on intrigue rather than action to move the story forward.

B001BR5NN0|5.0|It's clever and funny and touching.  Every teen needs to watch this movie.  John Hughes has great movies, and this one is my absolute favorite.
0486290492|5.0|I've seen two versions of the movie and now I've read the book. It differs from both versions of the movie. I was pleased to read how the story really goes. If you're a classical romance novel fan and you haven't read Jane Austen's works, you're missing out. 'Sense and Sensibility' is one of her best.
1781162646|2.0|Never had trouble with a Stephen King book before.  Avid fan.  Just found this boring.  Both storyline and lead character
B000001EC1|5.0|i am a great bon jovi fan and the cd came in good condition i have no regrets of this awesome cd
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the story. If you're an 80's buff, the author pads the story with way more detail than you need to relive your past. If you're not an 80's buff, the author pads the story with way more detail than you'd ever care to know. The story gets better as you go along and is interesting as it's a real-life (in fiction) adventure game.
B000002KHH|5.0|As history rewrites itself, how appropriate are the words to &#34;war pigs&#34; this songwriters words never go out of style or context. I guess his words are immortal.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Every so often we have media &#34;moments&#34; that shake the pop culture landscape like an earthquake. Who knows whether history will list this series as one of them - but it won't be because the cast and crew didn't give it everything they've got.<br /><br />Some shows have great writing but less than stellar acting or directing. Some shows have brilliant visual style and hollow scripts. Some shows have great substance and lousy style. THIS series gets everything right. From the writing to the acting to the directing to the soundtrack to the set design to the wardrobe EVERYTHING IS TOP NOTCH.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch's admittedly star-making turn as Sherlock is justly celebrated. But the hat must be tipped to creators Mark Gatiss ( who does triple duty as writer, showrunner and cast member - playing Sherlock's brother Mycroft ) and Steve Moffat who you know are giggling with fan boy glee even as they create one of the best reinventions of Sherlock EVER. A tip of the hat must also go to producer Sue Vertue ( Moffat's better half ) who hits the mark spectacularly in making Moffat's and Gatiss' vision a reality. Director Paul McGuigan apparently came up with the show's trademark visual style which highlights the inner workings of Sherlock's &#34;Beautiful Mind&#34; and Michael Price and David Arnold's soundtrack add the perfect sonic flourish to every episode.<br /><br />This isn't easy to do folks - which is evident when you see the unaired 60 minute pilot. Whatever the political or production decisions that moved the series from that 60-minute format ( and surprisingly more gregarious performance by Cumberbatch ) to the 90-minute version, it clearly allowed cast to crew to do a critical rethink that turned what was just a bright idea into a lighting strike that's left fans stunned and begging for more on both sides of the pond. Well done, well done.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I bought this after seeing Paul live in Seattle and I was not disappointed. First, with the movie, it was well filmed and well recorded with the right amount of Paul and his band, and the crowd. The Cd goes from song to song as connected by the crowd's cheering. Sadly none of the stories Paul told on the movie made it to the CD. But still, 5/5 stars.
B008133MDK|5.0|It always feels like lightning in a bottle when a series debuts while firing on all cylinders. The first season of Sherlock was riveting, refreshing must-see TV powered along by superb acting, writing, and directing - heck, even the soundtrack was putting its back into it! The season ended on a suspenseful note that seemed impossible to top. And then they did! Enough said.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I gave up cable a few months ago and hooked my computer to my TV using an HDMI cable.  Although this worked great, I was thrilled to have a wireless option.  Chromecast was easy to set up and use and its great value for money.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|If this inoffensive little popcorn flick has any dramatic heft it mostly comes from Hollywood's It Boy of the moment, Benedict Cumberbatch. Without him the movie is an enjoyable if forgettable distraction. With him it strives for something deeper and better. It doesn't get there, mainly because the script doesn't follow up on the intriguing moral dilemmas Cumberbatch's character represents. But every time he's on the screen you're compelled to watch him. He takes over the movie and leaves you breathless until the story veers away from him again. This is a MUST SEE if you are Benedict Cumberbatch fan. If you're a Star Trek fan, you'll possibly be underwhelmed aside from a moving performance by Zachery Quinto. But if you're happy with just a popcorn treat, this movie doesn't disappoint.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Tackle any electronic DIY project with this set.<br /><br />I bought this to take my battery out of my iPhone 4 after it was dropped in water.  However I can see after receiving it I won't need any other tools to do other electronic jobs.<br /><br />Excellent DIY videos/instructions on their website too.  All Free.  Why not spend money on their tools?
B005C4ERHQ|2.0|After going through this book and assessment, I think this book is really about giving you a \\"taste\\" of your talents and then for your corporation/organization to hire them for consulting. It does not help much for an individual. However, my friends who have used this for their company found it more useful. I recommend only purchasing this if your company hires them; otherwise it really does not bring much insight.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|I gave in reluctantly when my granddaughter asked permission to download this game to my Kindle and assumed I would just move it to my cloud later. But first, of course, I decided to give it a try. I was almost instantly hooked on this fun game. It becomes challenging at the higher levels and will provide hours of diversion and fun play.

B00CMQX84A|5.0|&#34;Teen Beach Movie&#34; is a brilliant deconstruction of 1960s teenage titles such as &#34;Beach Blanket Bingo&#34; and &#34;Ride the Wild Surf&#34; with the influence of the stage and screen tributes of &#34;Grease&#34; and the time travel antics of &#34;Back to the Future.&#34; It is also the second highest ranking cable television movie ever, right behind Disney's own &#34;High School Musical 2.&#34; The trumpeting of the huge number of viewers in the demographic of children age 2 to 11 ignores the fact of how pleasurable the movie is for adults as well, especially those engaged by its self-referential enthusiasm and its film-within-a-film structure, enlivened by a soupçon of post-feminist self actualization. This movie truly is fun for the entire family, and reveals additional charms in repeat viewings. The choreography, cinematography, editing and performing of musical numbers such as &#34;Surf's Up&#34; and &#34;Cruisin' for a Bruisin'&#34; and &#34;Like Me&#34; are infectiously entertaining. Particularly noteworthy are the charm and charisma of lead performer Ross Lynch as Brady, a regular on the Disney Channel's &#34;Austin & Ally&#34; show, who knows all about those old movie musicals such as &#34;Wet Side Story&#34; and figures out how to get back to the future with girlfriend Mack. To fellow surfer Tanner, Brady says: &#34;So, all you guys do around here is hang, eat and surf?&#34; and Tanner replies, &#34;Is there any other way?&#34; Brady agrees: &#34;Sounds perfect!&#34; Totally!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I loved this book, very engaging and well written! A good piece of history and comparatable to some of Toni Morrison's work.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I have to admit that I had low expectations going in to watch the movie.  I was pleasantly surprised with the movie on several levels.  Yes, there were action scenes, but this movie moved along mostly at a very sedate pace without being boring.  Tom Cruise did an admirable job in what was essentially a four character movie.  I won't include any spoilers - you'll have to watch this movie for yourself - you will not be disappointed.  It's a rare movie these days that can sustain a thoughtful pace with a tasteful use of action scenes.  Kudos to all involved in this movie.

0451452739|1.0|I've read Childhood's End and The Sentinel, both written by Clarke. Childhood's End was weird, The Sentinel was pretty good. This book is pretty much just those stories, put together. It's not groundbreaking in my mind, because Clarke had written it all before. I found it to be a big let-down. I was hoping for some new, mind-blowing ending. Nope.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this second book in Ken Follett's series. I am almost done and I have really enjoyed it! The story of the rise of Hitler and what that did to the world is told through the eyes of families in the US, Russia and Germany. It is long, but well worth the read.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The perfect keyboard! I can't even imagine going back to the stock keyboard after this. Easily worth the four buck, but ssometimes you can find it half price, or as the free app of the day. Download the trial, it won't disappoint!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome, downloaded it and can't stop playing it, there is just something about those little yellow guys that are funny.  It is fun of different levels to play, fast paced, and just plain addictive!

B00A85EMVK|4.0|The DVD was in brand new condition. It looked as if the plastic wrapping had JUST been taken off! I was very satisfied with the condition of the Blu Rays. The 3D was great but the movie kinda sucked. I hadn't seen it it years and remembered liking it more back in the 80's!
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Ive read the book many times and listened to the audiobook version. The character development is superb and very believable. The story line does not drag. I'm sorry that the solution was revealed by Agatha Christie since hours of thinking about possible solutions would be great fun.

B0089TGJ18|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moHYESJLIDLWMA]]This is one of the best blu-ray sets I own.  This particular Limited Edition Collectors set was not available from US retailers (I got mine from Amazon UK); and I believe it might be out of print now.  So while the price may be quite high, it's only likely to continue to go up in the future.<br /><br />It's a 5-disc set - one blu-ray for each of the four films, plus a bonus disc with hours of special features (many of which were taken from the DVD releases).  Regarding picture and audio quality, this is the best Indiana Jones has ever looked or sounded.  The blu-ray discs themselves are basically the same as the regular US set in terms of content - [[ASIN:B000NQRE9Q Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures (Raiders of the Lost Ark / Temple of Doom / Last Crusade / Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />The main difference between the regular set and this Limited Edition set is that there are a lot of cool extra items added in.  The most important of which is a replica of Indy's Journal, it's a very nice leather bound booklet with Indy's drawings and imagery from the films.  I think the journal included can also be purchased separately here: [[ASIN:1416563156 The Lost Journal of Indiana Jones]]<br /><br />Other extras in this blu-ray collectors set include:<br />- Photo cards from the set (one from each of the productions)<br />- a Film Cell display with a 35mm film frame from the movie<br />- matchbook from Club Obi-Wan<br />and various other props
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's a absolutely exceptional game to play with the whole family! Both my younger brother and my older brother play it and often converse about the game and the amount of dragons we have, it's really a good way to connect with your friends and family and play games and compare islands. It's both a easy and entertaining way to pass time. Highly recommended (:
B00499LTLM|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV series of the last few years.  Sherlock Holmes is a beloved character with a vast history in both print and on screen.  But I've often wondered how Sherlock would operate in the age of smart phones and blogs.  Fortunately, the writers/directors have taken these characters and given them the modern update they deserve.<br /><br />The single most important aspect to getting Sherlock right in the performance, and Benedict Cumberbatch makes for a fine Sherlock.  But there is another reason for the show's success - various cinematography and editing techniques are cleverly employed to convey what is going on inside Sherlock's mind.  This is something unique that can only be achieved through the language of film.<br /><br />I also enjoy the time format: each episode is 90 minutes, so it's basically like watching a movie.  The extra time allows for a more thoughtful approach to the story.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I love animated movies and I missed seeing this one when it was a new release. My husband and I had some down time one evening so we decided to check it out (Adam Sandler is in it after all!). It was a fun movie and the viewing quality was perfect. I highly recommend it, especially if you're looking for an animated family film with a touch of adult humor for the fall/Halloween season.
B00ENJZ2HA|5.0|Most people, myself included, really enjoyed \\"Argo\\". If you don't already own the film, this Extended Edition might be the way to go. But if you already own the original blu-ray release, then is it worth an upgrade? Well, hopefully the details below will help you make a decision.<br /><br />Included on the blu-rays:<br />- Theatrical Edition of the movie<br />- Extended Edition of the movie (an extra 10 minutes added to the film)<br />- 3 New Special Features + all the special features from the previous blu-ray release<br /><br />Included in the box set:<br />- 40-page book premium featuring behind the scenes photos, production notes, bios and more<br />- Argo One-Sheet Poster (you know they are going to fold it to fit it in the box, so it will have creases right down the middle)<br />- Map of Tehran movie locations (14\\" x 20\\")<br />- Reproduction of Tony Mendez's CIA ID card<br /><br />So if you enjoyed the movie, then you might want to consider picking this up. I'm interested in seeing if the extra 10 minutes of footage improves the film (not that it needs improvement); and with three all-new special features and the book/memorabilia from the film, this set might be worth it.<br /><br />********<br /><br />FULL LIST OF SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />Brand New Features (exclusive to this blu-ray set):<br />1.

B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Although it wasn't my favorite, Tangled was well worth watching. The characters were likable and the animation was really well done. It's one that adults can probably get into as well as children.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I take it season 4 has begun.  I really like this series and just love the period costumes.  The story lines and characters are fantastic.  I hope there are many more seasons to come.

B00EPMFZJK|4.0|It got a bit dull at times and was hard to push through but still was a good book with an alright plot.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Good 2 season  teaser for the show, but when you want season 3 you're expected to pay for it.  The advertising leads one to believe all the videos are free with Prime, but they are not, and more often than not there's a price for a movie or TV show.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it... this game is great. I have always wanted a horse, but could never get one. Now this game allows me to care for one.

B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I'm surprised how convenient it works - I was first sceptical about wearing it at night (I don't even like to wear a watch ever during the day). But its so light its not recognisable. Also the integration to the App and with the scale is smooth and useful.<br /><br />On a side note: just knowing that I have the pulse in my pocket changes behaviour: I walk more, take more stairs, ...
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Ok, writers:  1) Come up with a way to release actors from the show without killing them off. 2) Story line just getting a little dry. Still love the characters.

B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|I had heard nothing but negative about this movie. How confusing it was, that the graphics and effects were good but not enough to carry to the movie and a total WOW mind blower kind movie.<br /><br />Well, the first two are wrong, but the last is correct. Like butterfly effect, this movie takes you out of the normal 'think' and into an alternative think. Once you understand what you are watching and the progression of each character, you will most certainly enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Pamela O<br />Citrus Heights Ca
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This movie was so good.  It took me back to the70's John Carpenter movies like Assault on Precinct 13.  I thought Karl Urban was  way better than Stallone in the part of Dredd. The villain was one of the best female villains ever.
0316216453|4.0|Evelyn Waugh had two great loves: the English aristocracy (which he wasn't a part of--just their poodle) and his adopted religion, Catholicism.  With all the ardor of The Convert, Waugh can find solace and virtue in self-abnegation, self-loathing, self-absorption and self-righteousness. Like so many \\"catholic\\" artist's he finds ecstasy as a target for arrows and begrudges Jesus his crown of thorns (that would look SO much better on me!). To know even a little bit about EW's dissipated Oxford days can't help but make one wonder why is it always the debauched who become holier-than-thou.<br /><br />First, the self-righteous Lady Marchmain. The personification of sanctimonious prig, whom a husband and son Sebastian despise with an all-consuming hatred that sends one into exile and the other into his cups. Second, self-absorption: the rather prurient voyeur, Charles Ryder, who latches himself on to Sebastian and insinuates himself into the Marchmain clan, rather like the author himself, with the Lygon family at Madresfield. He starts as ingenue and becomes a rather jaded, vacuous hack, loyal to his ambition but keenly aware he is second rate. One doesn't object at all to Waugh's  ending for him and can't help but wonder how much of himself, Evelyn saw in Charles.  Surely the climbing part.<br /><br /> Next, self-loathing.  Poor Sebastian Flyte!  Allmost certainly homosexual he is crushed by his sexual inclination, Catholicism and a mother who could teach Torquemada a trick or two. Like the martyr of the arrows, this Sebastian is repeatedly pierced but by his own self-disgust. Last, representing  self-abnegation is the beautiful sister Julia. Having made a mistake marrying the wrong man and then having  strayed, apparently by the lights of Waugh's religion she must, as punishment be eternally miserable.  With this view of religion it is little wonder Lord Marchmain bolted and Sebastian finds solace in brandy.  They are a chilling charivari, this lot.<br /><br />One doesn't have to embrace Waugh's punitive Catholicism to admire his writing, though.  There is something admirable and very modern about an author who can craft a character like Charles Ryder.  He is basically extremely unlikable--the true anti-hero, and perfect chanticleer of aristocratic decline.  Charles practically rubs his hand with glee at the prospet of elbowing out the plodding Bridey.  But Waugh is too good a writer to look away from the inevitable outcome of the Marchmains, much as he might despair their loss.  And one is tempted to lament the end of Lord Marchmain, and a passing era, til we see what a nasty bastard a marquis near death can be.  In Lady Marchmain he might well have gotten what he deserved  Waugh's depiction of him, and other minor<br />characters such as Bridey, Anthony Blanche, Charles' father and the dreadful Beryl are little gems and great small achievements in themselves.<br /><br />Brideshead Revisited has been called Waugh's masterpiece andi think that is so.  A lamentation for a rather bad lot of toffs and a hosannah for a religion that provides cold comfort.'t have to embrace Waugh's punitive Catholicism to admire his writing, though.

B006MGDVIY|5.0|Before I saw this movie on ESPN2 I did not know who Ayrton Senna was. As an American and a NASCAR fan I hadn't been an avid follower of Formula One. That changed after watching this film. Afterwards I started researching and following not only F1 but also Senna himself. I found out more about the man, his life and his Times than I had expected, and I now know that the racing world, just as it was after the loss of Dale Earnhardt, is a much poorer place without Senna.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There is nothing that I did not like about this book. It had drama with a pinch of humor which is a very nice combination. John green is an outstanding writer and I now understand why this book has gone viral. It teaches many lesson and shows you different sides of life. This book has a very deep meaning but yet is easy to understand. I am looking forward to reading and seeing more of John Green.<br /><br />Ps.

Late delivery is not Amazon's fault. Factory was backordered due to heavy demand.<br />Did not get the free netflix trial as advertised.<br /><br />Overall the product is good for youtube streaming. That's it. Currently it is only a one-trick pony. Can't do anything else.<br />Can't stream local user owned content like music, vidoe and pictures. Third party app support is very lacking .<br /><br />What is most concerning is that, google is trying to limit outside content being streamed, i don't know why? I want to stream the pictures I took not the movie I buy from play store.

B000007SPU|5.0|Love TMC. All albums are great. I'm just happy that a label like 4AD would take a chance on such beautiful music. It's unlike anything you have ever heard (or will ever hear). This is music from another planet, presented in the most beautiful way. This takes me back to teenage heartbreak, yet places me in the promise of the PRESENT. 'Strength of Strings' is the top TUNE IMO.<br /><br />In a word, beautiful.
