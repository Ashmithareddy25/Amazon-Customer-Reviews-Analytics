B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is quit nice to be able to look at app and know about how much time u have left to accomplish what you need to do!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely am in love with this series!  I became hooked on the series from the very first episode I watched on Season One.  It's so well done - the characters are fabulous and the story is romantic and often heartbreaking.  I am now following Downton Abbey on Pinterest and just can't get enough photos to pin.  I love the way the characters speak and the compassion they have for each other.  This is the best series that I have ever followed.  I can't wait to see Season Three - I'm so excited about it!  Love, love, love this show!  Definitely a masterpiece - A+ program!
B007D2XSW0|3.0|just haven't used it would prefer to  have a double sided camera, havent taken any photos to edit! hope to someday
1401394191|5.0|I am in the car a lot and really enjoyed listening to &#34;Have a Little Faith&#34;.  Price is good for these books, on Amazon.  There is no comparison.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|El Camino is one of my favorites! The Black Keys know how to jam! Great tunes provides a great atmosphere and tons of enjoyment! My wife and I really are really enjoying this album.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Unique twist on a romance.  I liked both characters and loved it overall!  If you like romances you are going to enjoy this.  I am more of a paranormal romance reader but this book was worth the crossover.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Part 2 keeps you in more suspense than Part 1. You don't know what will hit you next and it's more loving then the next. I can't wait to see how they make the movie. I don't think they could make it as exciting as the books.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I found this book engaging and read it almost straight through. The plot kept me interested and had the required twists.
1861085257|5.0|A very imformative book.  I am just starting to use this craft medium and it has some very good tips and explanations.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|The Usual Suspects - I have seen this pic so many times and everytime I find something new.  Watch it, you'll like it too.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|it doesn't have a fraction option, which is something every calculator needs!  I really think that it needs a fraction option
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Little Women was one of my favorite books as a young adult. I downloaded it so I could reread as an adult. So glad to have a free version for my Kindle!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I played this on my computer before getting my Kindle, so I was really pleased to see it available. I find it a great way to while away some idle time. The visuals are extremely well done and not so difficult to make it frustrating.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|just what i wanted- got the 8 disk set on sale. there's no extra features, but for this deal, it was an acceptable trade-off in my opinion.
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|If you like the original star wars and don't care for CGI ladened crap sandwich lucas fed us in the 90s and beyond, you should really get your grubby nerd mits on this. Listening to Carrie Fisher talk about ripping off her gaffer tape, and her suggestion to raffle &#34;ripping it off&#34; to the crew as prize, is forever burned into my imagination.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|The book is pretty simple and easy to understand.<br />It's a great book for children with a lot of great themes.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|I am an avid fan of MS Bujold and this one is as usual, extremely well done.  She like Robert Heinlein makes you like her characters. It is especialy nice to see &#34;Ivan you idiot&#34; come out on top.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|There is a lot of fake musicianship in pop/rock music now a days.  Alabama Shakes is honest and they make music from the heart.  I hear influences from 50's/60's classic rock and roll to old school R&B (Motown).  This album was put together really well.  The sound on this album is very warm and well mixed.  Brittany Howard bares her soul to you vocally and the band keeps it in the pocket.  The peaks and valleys in the structure of the music are very honest.  I would recommend this timeless album to all music lovers.  This band has major respect for music history and you can hear it in there sound.  I can't wait to hear more from this band in the future!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Perfect ending to a great story about being loved and losing love. A story about life and death and understanding that life is better when your with the people you love.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter and I have enjoyed playing this game together as a reward. She's loving building her neighborhood. If you'd like, add her as a friend: RubyGirl25
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Entertaining story, but super predictable.  The characters are introduced in the 2nd chapter and right away it's clear who the bad guy is going to be.  I loved Gone Girl which is why I read this book as well.  I think I'll skip Gillian's 3rd novel.
B003ZD9DUC|5.0|Love watching this movie.  &#34;They say people don't believe in heroes anymore.  Well, damn them!  You and me, Max, we're gonna give 'em back their heroes!&#34;
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Maybe it's because I don't understand how to use the program but I am not completely happy with it.  While it seems easy I can't always find the things that I know I saved.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Even better than Season 1!  I was late catching on to this series.  What a great way to catch up!
B001GCUNYO|3.0|the blu ray disc got stuck and i don't know why, and i received late in my mail and hope it work for others..
B008Y212PI|5.0|I just can't seem to get enough of these FlipPix games! They range from fun and easy to pretty challenging. This game is great for hours of fun, or just a quick game to pass some time. Love!
B007CKNX28|5.0|After seeing him on Later With Jools, we became instant fans. I prefer his live recording much more, but this is very good also.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely loved these books! GREAT STORY! GREAT plot and amazing love scenes. WILL recommend to all my close girl friends.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|I was never able to play it, because it would never download. I tried several times, over an hour each time, and finally had to remove it from my Kindle
B00846F1YW|5.0|It's a great hidden objects game. I have only played 4 levels so far. But if you like finding things it's good.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|It's the last great series (thus far) of one of the best sci-fi universes around. Great characterization for a crew lost and hopelessly alone in unknown territory.
B002VBV1S6|5.0|I loved the way the story keeps on jumping between current and historic experiencing for the main characters, help with building a decent foundation for the plot and add a lot of intrigue to the story.<br /><br />Author also goes to great length to describe a scene and surroundings.<br /><br />A definite read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Best game ever the dragons are awesome I'm glad I downloaded this game it's very fun I play this every day
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this app!  I play Bloons TD online and have Bloons TD 4.  They just keep getting better and better!  Ninja Kiwi did a great job designing and bringing this to life.  Plus there are extra tracks, a new tower, and a few other goodies that aren't available in the online version!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Hilarious, fast paced well written survival story.  The science and tech seemed actually plausible.  The only problem was I read the book in a day, I couldnt put it down!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I haven't been on Twitter a whole lot since I got my kindle fire but so far it's just like the Twitter app I had on my phone and the app makes it easy to navigate around Twitter and its just a really easy, no problems app:)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I seriously loved this book! The characters had way more depth than I expected. Maybe I'm bad at picking out books, but usually the main characters bore me to tears and I soon forget all about them after I finish reading. These ones didn't.<br />I couldn't guess as to what was going on until about the last quarter of the book. The ending was kind of drawn out but not terribly so. Totally worth the time and money. I was pleasantly surprised.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Just like the app I had on my phone, but better!!! It's just like being on a computer which is really nice because then I can get to where I can delete the spam and trash folders! Love it so far!:)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it!!!  No cards to mess with.  This has always been one of my favorite games and when I saw it, I had to have it on my Kindle.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Just like the app I had on my iPhone! It's super easy to navigate and runs smoothly! I would recommend to anyone! Haven't had any problems yet!! Love it!:)
B000SEGMAU|5.0|A book every student should be required to read, it changes you and gives you a second  chance at life.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|its great you get lives and if u find thus game I am very picky of my games so if I love this game u will probly to. so u should get this game now
B0045INOCO|5.0|Wonderful performances by all. The redux completely ruins the mystique of Sheen's character. Original is a must see for all.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford Season 1 [HD] is a wonderful period series. I just love these kinds of shows and am glad to have another great option!
B00846F1YW|3.0|I can not give the product a fair review because my phone will not allow me to download it without removing my warranty.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This author is for me is one of the best I have read in along time she holds your attention and is a good read.Ihave read every thing she had published so far and not been disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a very good and bad game for kids. It's good because it is a awesome and brilliant idea to h  made it for kids and I think that the bad thing is that there are to many of the trains.
B007TK77QE|3.0|While a perfectly acceptable storyline this book did not meet my expectations of a J.K. Rowling story. I found it slow moving and not really to my taste. I prefer murder mysteries but thought I would have a change of pace and try something different. It reminded me of an Agatha Christie novel without all the murders.I found it to be very 'wordy' in that it comes in seven parts. I like the challenge of a good, fast moving who dunnit. Those who prefer a more sedate story will really enjoy this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BOTH MY BOYS LOVE THIS GAME, ESPECIALLY ON THEIR KINDLE FIRE HD 7&#34;.  THEIR FRIENDS WERE VERY IMPRESSED, AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|When Christopher Nolan is behind a genre flick, you can rest assured it will kick some bootie!  Not only did he make Bruce Wayne/Batman more real of a character, he treated him within his own realm of existence.  He had limitations (though not financial!) and had a depth to him you don't always (Or used to not) get in these kinds of movies.  We had a genuine individual fighting the good fight.<br /><br />Nolan raised the bar for anyone else who will try and make a successful comic book character movie.<br /><br />Oh!  And with Nolan producing MAN OF STEEL, wow, I can't wait for that one.<br /><br />Bruce, aka, brusimm.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|CANNOT PLAY WITHOUT FACEBOOK?  MY 9 YEAR OLD DOESN'T HAVE FACEBOOK.  :(  THE GAME IS FREE, BUT NOT ABLE TO PLAY IT..
B006L1TT8G|5.0|My daughter LOVES this cd and I was happy that it got here in the time it was promised!!! Thanks
B003O86FMW|5.0|I did not expect that she would go in the HUNGER Games again I was so scared I cried ahh
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. Very entertaining and addicting. Keeps me busy for hours! A few small glitches but not very noticeable. I will be waiting for more updates!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Don't buy just a copy of my game minecraft please don't git cause a virus that makes it crap so don't bad graphics, everything is dumb please buy minecraft cause I'm marking minecraft 3$ so get Minecraft then cause
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this game!!! Passes time. Graphics are great. Wish it went a little faster though, takes time to get through the first few levels
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun. But very sensitive to touch. Other than that very fun  game. Great time waster, good for little kids to play
B0061S073A|4.0|I am taking time to write a review so would have to recommend this app. It does have a couple or glitches but for the most part it delivers and oh yeah it's free.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is always powerful spiritual nutritional to have a copy of God's word available, ready for reference and sharing. Thank you for this application. It is magnficient!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|My son likes to take care of the animals in the game, he also likes to get new ones .
B00846F1YW|5.0|Thanks for making this game free. A great way to pass the time away. I can see replaying it several times
B003K71W9I|5.0|Smooth and lovely. very relaxing and an easy listen. I highly recommend this CD. I have a musical friend to whom I've recently given a copy. He was visibly impressed with my taste in music!
B006BXT4TI|5.0|I can't get enough of this album.<br />I have recommended it to friends.<br />I got the digital booklet version.<br />Enjoy!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well presented view of life from the turn of the century of a great home.  Covers several decades of very changeable times.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great watch.  The instant view was perfect, streamed nicely with no stopping.  Way better than netflix!
B00BC3IKWE|5.0|I loved and moved to most of these tracks initially and each subsequent listen only deepens how much I dig'm. Effing SOLID release right here.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I actually thought this was a true story.  Unfortunately, today it could be.  Something our grandmothers did not have to worry about.
B00993FEUK|5.0|I saw this at the theater and on the BluRay. I didn't expect to like it. However, it's wonderful fun, highly enjoyable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was playing this game whe  i decided try the first one again. number one is so easy compared to number two. if i had to vote which ones better(1 or 2) id pick a deffinate number two!!!! this games rocks and im telling  the truth!!!!
B005LAII3U|4.0|This movie is, in my opinion, exceptional. It is a remake, but it is very different from the original. I like it much better. I've seen it three times at the theater and twice on BluRay.
B002O3Z4Y8|4.0|Sleepers is one of my all time favorite movies.  There has been a great deal of controversy as to whether the story is really true or not, but it almost doesn't matter if you are watching the movie for its entertainment value.<br /><br />It is the story of a how a few friends conspire for justified revenge for their horrific mistreatment as children in a juvenile home.  The ensemble cast is perfectly suited to their parts and De Niro and Pitt are standouts as their characters are the central pieces to the plan.<br /><br />I wish I could give separate reviews for the movie itself and the product.  The movie is 5 stars.  The older DVD pressing that I own is horrible, 2 stars at most.  It is a two-sided DVD that you have to turn over in the middle of the film.  Not sure if more recent pressings have corrected this.  If I was purchasing this today, I would go for the Blu-Ray version as I would imagine that it contains the movie on a single side.
B006RXQC2Y|5.0|One of the best movies of all time!  It will make you laugh and cry.  There are classic lines in the movie that you will always remember.  Love it!
1878424319|4.0|The writing style is a bit simplistic but it gets the main messages across. This book was recommend by a friend and it is an easy read.
B00683JK9K|5.0|If you like puzzles you'll love this also you can choose your own degree of ability you'll love it  try it
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I am enjoying the films in HD, but they are extremely difficult to remove from the packaging without touching the underside of the discs.  The star wars set has enough of the disc showing that you can grab it from the center and edge, but on this set they are completely inside the cardboard and you really have to just grab the disc and pull it out of the sleeve, leaving fingerprints and possibly scratches.  The packaging is beautifully done other than this factor.<br />  I like the look of the PQ and the fact that raiders retains more of its theatrical look, though some have complained about the remaster. Other films look great to me as well, but it would be better if they could have digitally removed kate capshaw from temple of doom.<br />  The movies sound great as well, and at the end of Raiders I felt that I was actually there during the face melting scene.  Thank God they didn't do any digital \\"enhancements\\" to this or any other scene.  The effects hold up extremely well and look worlds better than any cartoonish cgi garbage they would likely replace it with. You don't mess with a masterpiece.
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|songs were silly, can't really play this on a phone. no skill involved - not good music quality  -- -0
B004DM0UII|5.0|This is the best radio, I've ever found. The only issue is the reset it does by itself, but nothing extreme.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book kept me going from one page to the next. I totally enjoyed it very much. Now onto book Three.
B00992CF6W|4.0|really fun but one thing you cant get flint and steel in creative mode so you cant blow up Tnt or create fire
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just getting started and don't see myself stopping anytime soon. can't wait to open to open the other games that come with it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A fine, elegant puzzle game. Moderately addictive, with as gentle a difficulty curve as the player likes. I like uncluttered but slick software like this. Well done.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Just like a similar game for PC mentioned in other reviews. I really enjoyed that one and this one is going along nicely. So far everything is working fine but it is still pretty early in the game. Looking forward to getting back to it. Worth the download.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|A friend suggested this book and said she couldn't put it down.  But, it's not my kind of book, I just couldn't get into it.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|A little too coy.  I don't appreciate being tricked by the author.  I didn't enjoy it as much as &#34;Atonement&#34;
B009WO7NQO|5.0|my faveorite bird is the red bird R2-D2 bird little blue bird and the yellow bird. app. AWESOME :) :) :)
B000NY12CI|4.0|Infidel was eye-opening regarding the actual Qur'an teachings and the life of Muhammed.  The author has such curiosity and spirit!
B000J5XS3C|2.0|When I received this product, I assume I got a defective one.  The phantom power portion of the mixer had a short in it and my microphones would not stay powered.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story is heartwarming and has some surprising twists to it. It also makes you very thankful for what you have. I recommend this book for everyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Book was so good, even though I was moving and working, I couldn't put it down! The twist at the end was the best. 29777777 stars!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abby is an excellent series. My only complaint, we have a direct ethernet connection but, we were interupted several times due to buffering.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME PLAYING THIS GAME IT IS NOT JUST FOR KIDS I AM OVER FIFTY AND HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME PLAYING IT<br />GREAT FOR USING THAT GREY<br />MATTER WE CALL OUR BRAIN I RECAMEND THIS GAME FOR EVERYBODY
B00B2166BS|5.0|From the time I plugged it in, it's already charged from 84% to 90% in about an hour.  Works much quicker than the mini USB charger.  As already stated in another review, I think it should be mandatory to box these cables with the Nexus.  The charge time with the USB was ridiculously too long.  Now I can actually run apps while charging without still seeing my battery percentage dropping.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very fun game.  . . . . . well worth time and good thinking. don't mess up lol no fixes thati can see so far
B0049J3RBC|5.0|Somehow I missed this Pixar movie when it came out in 2007. I had always heard that it wasn't very good, so I never bothered seeing it. This weekend, curiosity got the better of both my wife and I (she was in the same boat I was), so we decided to rent it. It was, in a word, fantastic. Original idea, well written with great execution in plot and script from the Pixar team.<br /><br />Although my perception was that it was one of the weaker movies of the Pixar family, I have learned the truth. I am now going to buy the movie to ensure that I have a copy for the future when I will definitely be watching it again.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I enjoyed watching it.  The movie has great action and a decent story line.  Great when on plane or waiting! Definetly worth watching.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Once you start playing, you can't stop.  You have to keep going until you win.  Can also be frustrating at times.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|When I first started playing it was good. But now no one is getting notified when some one takes there turn. I would love to rate higher but I think you got to big to fast and started having problems with not enough resources. Please fix this!
1616550414|5.0|I receive this book from Amazon not too ago and very IMPRESS! Top notch quality! I can't speak for anyone else out there but don't hesitate to get one while it's cheap!....retail for $34.99  I love all things Zelda and this is a book to cherish for any Zelda fanatic..........worth more if it was to stop printing and be a collector's dream. Although this book didn't cover the Phillips CD-i Zelda version which I can understand wasn't develop by Nintendo but I still give it a 5 star anyway. On the plus side, this would be a great read for kids and adults alike that enjoy their video game icon. Like they say....reading is fun and is encourage for the young gamers@heart.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Excellent movie - sort of prequel, but not exactly.  The &#34;how did they get there&#34; sort of movie is always fun.  Almost as good as the remake of Star Trek with new characters and sort of new story line.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I highly recommend this game for both adults and children. The puzzles are beautiful also. I give it a full five stars.
B0095P3ULC|2.0|Less of a plot than the first movies. Fell asleep twice watching it, despite all the explosions....Seems like the writers may be running out of ideas
B006ATJXQW|5.0|it was a very confusing book at the end but a great book.<br />i loved it very much. i hope theres anoher book.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|There's been a lot of hype about this album, and it's easy for that kind of thing to just build up your expectations.. but plain and simple, this record delivers. I wouldn't change a thing! Although album most likely won't change your life, it is for sure memorable and worth the money. My favorite tracks are some of the more overlooked ones: Infinite Love Without Fulfillment, Visiting Statue, Symphonia IX (My Wait Is U), and Know The Way. Don't forget to check out her earlier stuff, too!
0525952926|5.0|This book is well-written and, in spite of being very heavy to hold, well worth reading.  As this is a trilogy, you really need to read the books in order.  This is the second of the trilogy and I can hardly wait for the third. This book is an important look into our history.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Like her other two, I loved this one also.  The clicking on the one song that some have mentioned doesn't bother me at all but I had read the other reviews before I bought it, so was prepared.  There is way too much empty space after selection 11 at the end of the cd before it starts over, at least 6 or 7 minutes.  Why would that be?
0399160450|5.0|Threat Vector is one of the better of recent books by Tom Clancy.  I had become disillusioned by some of his later books after his big success with The Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising, Executive Orders etc. but the last two or so have been improvements.  I think that going with the next generation and letting Jack Ryan and his contemporaries become background characters is the way to go.  Thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Brilliant book, it had me crying, laughing and smiling to myself. Really enjoyed it. Was hoping there would be hopeless 2.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Enjoyed the book....after really getting into the characters and their stories, I was disappointed with the abrupt ending; however, I thought the book was still great! Ken Follett never lets you down!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I really like this show. Science -Fiction is done well.<br />a. a a a a a a a  a a a
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Any way you slice it, this was an excellent movie. British intelligence has been the dark horse of history since the days of Sir Francis Walsingham.<br /><br />May 007 continue ad perpetuam.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This was a great movie for James Bond fans.  There was a lot of action and of course Daniel Craig looked spectacular.  Judi Dench did her usual amazing job and she alone is worth seeing this movie.  The scenery and the action was great and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good action film.
B00005V9IK|4.0|Independence Day is in my viewpoint one of Will Smith's better roles and I manly own it just for the special effects.  For the time frame it was release at the special effects were quite stunning.  I also enjoy the acting jobs of the other actors in the movie some very talented actors that have gone onto better roles in tv shows and movies.  But if your looking for a good science fiction movie and a fan of Will Smith movies or in general a fan of his then you will like this movie.  But like most people who have watched this movie you end up saying it's one of those you like it, love it, or don't.  But for myself I will always keep it in my collection of action movies because no matter how much time passes it still impresses me to this day and it came out in 1996.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was easy to relate to and had a lot of surprising and interesting twists. Even though it was very inappropriate at most parts (language & sex) I don't regret reading it and makes me think more about people and what they've been through, and not to be quick to judge.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|In The Electric Mist<br /><br />I like John Goodman but he was miscast as a villain. Tommy Lee Jones' character was not likeable when he wasn't<br />roughing up people, he was talking to ghosts.
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|The book is about a coterie of prescient individuals who had the audacity to bet against the popular belief that housing market, and, by extension, sub-prime mortgage-backed securities, will continue its rise for the foreseeable future. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to speak intelligently on the subject of the housing bubble and the ensuing financial crisis.
B001EC3JME|4.0|Good product fit my light perfect, also fits on my work belt great. I also bought a second for a friend.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The m book was ok. I was a little disappointed though. I expected a lot more of the book one action in book two. But really, it had to get boring somewhere- eventually.
B001D09OAI|3.0|Yes - It is a funny movie.  And my wife does love it.  But, the movie is mediocre at best.
B003B02O14|4.0|I have read so many Grisham novels and they are all very good.  This one requires a little knowledge of law (all of his do), but it is helpful to keep with the story.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It's interesting how large our old Nintendo systems where and now they are able to make games with this small table! Pretty amazing!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Amazing story ....  definitely keeps you reading. So much description of the life of two young people in the greatest of love
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is hours of fun. It has multiple levels. It also has different gems with in the puzzle that lead to higher points..
B005FISBTO|5.0|My mom fell in love with Dexter that she watches it on tv first.Then i buy the dvds for her.She already has the first 5 shows.So i had to get her number 6
B004G606K8|4.0|I was looking for a straight-forward, companions' quest and I found it in this book.  It is not stunning but it also isn't completely formulaic. I enjoyed it and look forward to the next.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I love this show and am so excited to own both seasons for myself. It got here faster than I was expecting, too!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|It was a very good book and kept my attention riveted throughout.  I was never bored by it and that is what I require of a book.<br />Title:  Sharp Objects
B00A80SHFM|5.0|My family and I went to see the movie and were humming the songs for days. We just had to get the music CD. We are all enjoying it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this show. It's just amazing. I hope others find it and it enjoy it as much as I do.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I would really, really like the entire soundtrack.  Many songs/lyrics are different/revised from stage performance--and better!  Boo to the person who cropped the recording and left out some of the best parts.
0062200909|5.0|This is the kind of book you need to complete an extraordinary experience,like it was The HOBBIT: An Unexpected Journey movie, because you find additional information including graphics that make you appreciate the details in the film.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the kindle for android.  I use it everyday.  Lots of great choices for books and they have all been good.  Chance to read new authors.
B008K8X0IS|4.0|This product is excellent for the presentation of the box and the series itself, but I think it would be better for a Collector´s edition if the dragon egg would be a little more bigger and maybe include an art book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really amazing and if you can get this then you need to because this game is really fun and if you don't think so then you are weriod
B009JBZH54|5.0|For me this is the ultimate Batman saga. I believe it is not possible to do a better version of this superhero. A great job from Cristopher Nolan, Christian Bale is the best Batman-Bruce Wayne ever and all the support cast has an excellent quality (Freeman, Caine, Oldman, Eckhart, Ledger, Hardy, etc) and of course the features and extras are awsome !!! This is a MUST in every single house of everyone who loves the movies!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this but you have to be fast or you will run off the bluff..but i will get better!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I do not watch a ton of television and I must admit, I do love &#34;period&#34; pieces. This program has kept me engrossed through each and every episode. I actually have friends who have kids in college, who have become hooked. It's so nice to watch the civilized act so uncivilized at times, proves we are all human. A lot of fun to watch!
B00B2Q9NM2|4.0|If you are a martial arts film enthusiast, this is easily a film you would enjoy. Some parts of the movie were intentionally corny to satirize some of the cliches you see in traditional hong kong flicks, which i found funny. only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because in a martial arts film, I expect a satisfying show down between the protagonist and antagonist towards the end. In this movie that didnt really happen.
B005DNPJKU|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because it was captivating all the way through.  It was based on a true story so that made it all the more compelling.  I liked everything about this movie which took place during Victorian England.  Even the Queen had a part via messenger.  The &#34;stage&#34; was realistic, rather gloomy as I believe the times were back then.  There was much pollutioin due to the industrial revolution.  But while some of the characters were incredibly inhumane, the humanity and warmth of others were realistically genuine.  The viewer even got to see &#34;growth&#34; in some of the characters as they became involved with John Merrick, but best of all was being able to view John Merrick as a human being he is rather than the monster he had been forced to portray much of his life.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It was awesome much cheaper than paying a month of cable service I only pay for what I want to watch
1250006341|5.0|I have been following the series on TV and found it to be one of the most enjoyable.  This book is wonderful - giving great detail tion informathat we may have forgotten while watching TV and also the pictures are fabulous showing detail of the wardrobes.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Absolute fantastic! Nice man singing nice music, I just love it. And so do all the people i have played it for. i recommmended it to all my friends at a party last friday.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|A solid book that introduces who introverts are, the extrovert ideal that's prevalent in all corners of society, the nurture vs. nature argument with relation to temperament, and how to nurture kids that are introverts.<br /><br />Throughout the book, she talks about the advantages of disadvantages of both introverts and extroverts, and—if you're an introvert—how to make the most of your strengths, some of which are deep concentration, inner exploration, and having in-depth conversations with people, one-on-one. She also talks about how much we can break out of the negatives of introversion, such as fear of public speaking, large groups, and being sociable.<br /><br />In general, this was a strong book talking about many aspects of introversion, its place in society, and how to make the most of it. I found myself being quite glad to be an introvert (though it does seem like she sings the praises of introverts a lot.)<br /><br />The historical content and practical ideas in this book, coupled with the recent scientific research into temperament and how much we can stretch it, make it a very good book. I didn't find it incredible, but I related with the book to a strong degree. Worthwhile read.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone this is an awesome book!!!! So I hope everyone loves it like me bye.
B0030MM68O|5.0|The movie is amazing I recommend you watch it. It's one of the best war movies I have seen. Jeremy renner is amazing
B0054LJGWS|4.0|This is story of the end times with a sense of humor. The 2 main characters ( a demon and an angel) are 2 unlikely allies with a different take on the world than their respective bosses. Overall I liked the book, it is very heavy on British humor and sarcasm, much like &#34;A Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&#34;.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game but many times when trying to click items on this list the little red x pops up and say 20second penalty for clicking too much.  Clearly it was the correct item but it did not recognize when I clicked on it
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book it really was like the movie just a little different but it's a good book for teens
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is addictive and I love it ever since I got it I have not been off it.I love it.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|I rcvd the song that i wanted but many of the songs on the cd I had no interest in. The CD is a good buy.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|[[ASIN:1481130331 The Luck of the Weissensteiners (Volume 1)]]<br /><br />The Luck of the Weissensteiners - Book 1 of the Three Nations Trilogy<br />by Christoph Fischer<br /><br />A story that needs be told; `lest we forget'.<br /><br />I give Christoph Fischer's 'The Luck of the Weissensteiners - Book 1 of the Three Nations Trilogy' 5 Stars.<br /><br />Here is a powerful story of the fate of Eastern Europe through the years of tragedy that was World War II. The author shows us, through the eyes of the Weissensteiner family, the disintegration of the whole of human experience from the pressures exerted upon the population through the Nazi way of conquest. All decency (as well as loyalty, friendship, even the ties of family) implodes upon itself driven to extremes by hate, prejudice, fear, and propaganda.<br /><br />We see the innocence of youth evolve into desperation as Nazism begins to strangle Eastern Europe. We see its effects harden and sour all it touches for victim and victor alike as the war progresses to its fated end and beyond into the unsettled peace that followed. Christoph's powerful writing style makes you feel the lives and struggles, even the fates, of his characters. Readers will remember why this story needs to be embraced - not only so we not forget but so we not condemn ourselves to relive these tragedies.<br /><br />A memorable literary event.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|the cd was in great condition. It took a while to reciece it but outher then that ever little thing was just fine. thank you very much.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I have really enjoyed Downton Abbey up to season 3. I wish you would keep it more lighthearted instead of it being so traumatic. Having Sybil die was harsh. Not looking forward to more episodes. Very sad! Loved seasons 1 and 2.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story with solid characters. I didn't have any preconceptions, but found myself drawn in by the fluid writing.<br /><br />Interesting twist on the post apocalypse genre.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Took me in from the first chapter. Just 'borrowed' book 2. Have Prime so it is free to borrow the books. Great Deal, Great Books!!!!
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|I'm not ashamed to have something that looks kind of like a purse. It feels nice and is perfect for me. My Kindle fits in it just right and it's my favorite type of Kindle carrying case. It's better in my experience that cases that open like a book, considering the Kindle is already pretty small.
B007REV4YI|1.0|What has gone wrong with Bond?....It has begun taking itself too seriously.  If you like waiting 20 to 30 minutes between an action sequence, this movie is for you.  They just aren't as fun as they use to be.  Yawn....Too much drama.<br /><br />With gadgets being removed from his repertoire??  All he gets is a type of locator homing signal and a PPK gun that can only be shot by him.  Down to one woman seduced per movie?  They are taking the fun out of it.  It's worthy of watching (renting) once...not buying to watch again.  The sound quality is not as good as Brosnan movies.  With a $10K 7.1 sound system, it was not crisply recorded and sounded muffled at times.  A forgettable movie.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|The outside of this carrying case lacks that classic feel.  It's a downer in the tactile department.<br /><br />Inside there are reliable corner grips that are easy to manage and only slightly cover the speaker.  That's ok, appearance is not flashy.  Too bad it misses the genuine feel.
B00846F1YW|2.0|Got to chapter 13 and cannot get the game to work on my kingle fire HD so mad i like the game
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Classic Clancy!<br />This books keeps you in suspence all the way to its conclusion.<br />If you liked his others, you will love this.<br />-Ken Smith<br />-Anchorage
B0071MDA2U|5.0|Loved this book.  I can't wait for the next book to come out.  A quick, easy read.  If you like Hunger Games you will like this series
B009POCG0Y|3.0|Matthew McConaughey does an ok roll.  Not his best part but not as sad as his character in Magic Mike.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|If you like the Hunger Games, you will like this series.  Read all the available books in one weekend.  Couldn't put them down.  Can't wait for the third book to come out.
B009MO57H6|4.0|Another good one in the series. we hope the continue.  We now own the whole series and can't wait for the next one.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Hated this book.  Hated the characters.  Hated the ending.  Huge waste of time.  Ending was frustrating and I felt like I wasted too many hours of my life reading this.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Beauty and the Beast has become a classic Disney film. This was a Christmas gift for a little girl.  She asked for it specifically
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game, best time water, very tactical game. Great for the money, need more quicker updates to game needed though.
B005LAII3A|4.0|Colin Farrell does a good job in this action film.  I personally liked it better than the old version.  Thank you
B009O2XY12|4.0|Cool graphics and cool color scheme. I loved how the little critters come to life and the amazing lightining. Awesome
B009POCG2C|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Clint Eastwood has found a good character &#34;type&#34;.  Loved Grand Torino.  This one follows right behind.
B0036UW09U|5.0|Streisand and Kristofferson were both great in this remake of a stoy first done in 1937. Music was nothing short of spectacular. I saw this on the big screen when it came out in 1976 and it was just as good nearly forty years later.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|You can't go wrong with Tinker Bell.  Lucy Liu does a good job as a voice.  Fun story and new character.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I like the remake and new take on the original story line. The premise was a fresh idea that needed some development....just like the first movie. Great Effects, but I'm CG partial
B000HF6XPY|4.0|Bought as A Christmas gift.  Not my favorite type of movie but the family member who wanted it was very happy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this book!! I have already recommended this book to several of my friends. I want to order more books from this author.
B009MO5E10|4.0|This is an interesting movie.<br />All the action on the bicycles made me a little sea-sick at times but otherwise, entertaining.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|A very good but graphic movie yet amzing for action and blood and there is a little bit if comedey from the drill sargent pretty funny
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|I loved it. It it a grate way to listen to music. I liked it a lot it is a great app
B006O3MU96|4.0|It's so simple but I just couldn't put it down sometimes.  I guess it's just that way with games sometimes.
B005ES11YW|5.0|it is good product. it is expensive, however it is good. i am a medical doctor and i need it when i am on call. really comfortable.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I have never seen my pictures this amazing before. Get this app guys you won't regret it, it's worth every penny.
B007N8RULO|3.0|It's ok I guess, not what a friend had explained to me.  Maybe I just need more practice.  Maybe a younger person would like it.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|Florence really let's us hear how angelic she is on Ceremonials.  After seeing in a small venue, I am a huge fan!
B000PC0SPU|4.0|I found this title in a magazine I was reading and had to read it! Gives one pause for thought indeed! Not for everyone however the author puts forth a good case. Inquiring minds will find it interesting.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|The Black Keys are one of the most consistent acts around.  Great gritty sound but can be commercial as well.  I'm a big fan.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It was awesome cannot wait for the next one.<br />It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time and I could not put it down
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I like Bruce Willis and Gordon-Levitt.  They work well together in this movie.  The story is interesting and unfolds well.
B0009A21R6|5.0|This sounds just great.  Some SACD's sound only slightly better to me but this one is right up there.  Maybe not the last word in sound, but it's close.  Recorded a long time ago too, so they did well.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Good movie...anxiety provoking for sure. Runs you through a roller coaster of emotions. Exceptional acting. Worth watching as long as your in the mood to be rocked.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game a lil scary like it a lot I would play it a gain liked where the game took place great. story line
B002V6RB1C|4.0|The old ones were and always will The Best! I enjoyed it again very much and I am sure you will as well...
B009178OQA|5.0|This simple documentary spans around the life and thoughts of Jiro Nakamoira, one of the best sushi chefs in the world. Though it is focused on his mentality and practices, this film is not about making sushi. Through the simple teachings of Jiro one will understand what the route to professional success and excellence is. It portrays the Japanese culture, the mentality that one should always work to elevate his art and love what he does. Very good movie. Highly recommended.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Did not like this movie very much. The premise was confusing...Will have to watch it again to get a better understanding...
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I loved it. Ordered season three and now can't wait till season. Masterpiece theater great job.<br /><br />Will look forward to new series that starts in March.
B00466HNHM|5.0|I have wanted a Blu-ray of this movie for a long time now and seeing it again didn't disappoint. I just wish there was more extra's it does include the video for the title song and the trailer so I'm happy with that.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I would recommend this cd to anyone who loves to listen to a truly remarkable voice.  Streisand and company offer a wonderful diversity which I have not heard on one cd.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|I've always had the question of where do you draw the line of evil and insane? This doesn't exactly answer these questions but it does give some insight to the pondering question: are some people born evil or is it developed through how they are raised (or lack thereof)? Swinton is amazing of course, never doubted she would be. There are unsanswered questions which I wish were answered, which I won't mention because of spoilers. However, in a situation like this, there are SO MANY unanswered questions it's almost fitting. An interesting look into a psychological look at &#34;troubled&#34; kids and their parents.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|This show reminds me of little house on the prairie<br />With a British feel<br />Good wholesome program, for the whole family
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I needed to listen to some new bands. Our radio stations here are lacking in the new rock/alternative department so it's unfortunate. That's why I go to AmazonMP3 and listen to the samples they recommend. Heard a few songs on this and saw it was #1 in alt rock. Best CD I've heard in YEARS. I love how different they sound, it's refreshing! &#34;It's Time&#34; is my favorite song hands down. The album feels like a pick me up when I'm down. If you're looking for a new refreshing band GET THIS! It's been on repeat on my phone forever.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Good intertainment. Maybe not the most family friendly movie in the world but what do you expect from an action film.
B009FOBMBI|3.0|I have every 3 Days Grace album, and this one I can't seem to get into as much as the others. However, I do find that &#34;High Road&#34; is one of my favorites IF NOT my favorite they've done. I think it's worth listening to but really it's for die-hard fans for the most part.
B009YU62H2|4.0|I'd recommend this album to anyone who likes Soundgarden. I'm glad they came back together. The sound is more grown up and less raw than before, but still good.
1401907725|5.0|This is my 4th Doreen Virtue deck.  I was first introduced to D.Virtue 12 yrs. ago when I bought my first deck.  The Daily Guidance from your Angels deck is full of positive energy & when used daily gives the reader an upbeat and inspirational message.  The individual message on each card sets the theme and the accompanying booklet gives the reader further insight into the issue or question at hand.  This is how I use this deck on a daily basis ... I pick one card from the deck and let the theme / message and my inner intuition guide me with any issues I may be dealing with in my life.<br />I compared this with the original deck (Healing with the Angels Oracle cards) I own (purchased in 1999-2000) and found that some of the themes overlap in these decks, i.e. joy, inner child, forgiveness, trust & confidence, etc.  This not a criticism of her works but thought I'd point this out.  I also own the Archangel Michael oracle deck and the Saints and Angels deck.  Both of these are also beautiful and have inspiring, positive and motivational guidance.  Overall, this Daily Guidance from your Angels deck is an excellent deck for beginners as well as experienced readers & one to be treasured for many years.
B000ID1J40|1.0|While I have seen this movie many many times, and I consider it one of the greatest of all time. I purchased the DVD to replace a lost copy. I received a 24 hour rental as well. Little did I know that if I am not a Kindle or Apple fan that I am not allowed to watch this video on my device or even on my computer it seems.<br /><br />Very displeased, and will not order another video or DVD for that matter from Amazon. I also ordered \\"Hackers\\" at the same time in video format, cant even download it to watch on my local machine. No different than the lock-in provided by iTune's. From now on if it is not in the Google Play store I will order a DVD and burn a digital copy for the mobile devices. Way to go Amazon, the # 1 selling Mobile OS (Android) that has allowed you to prosper in the Mobile market has been locked out from your services. Thanks. At least I had free two day shipping so I can have the DVD to watch this weekend.
B001J3U22S|4.0|Must read for Dune fans and scifi fans in general. Completes a major story arc from several books for Brian Herbert.  Reading on Kindle was easy and seamless
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book keeps you guessing all the way through, as you try to figure out where the characters are and how they got there. I can' t wait to read book two.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show and was able to watch without any problems.  Well worth the price I paid to watch it.  Will do it again.
B00846F1YW|3.0|On my 4 1/2 inch phone screen it's very difficult to search<br /> for smaller items must be much better on a  larger tablet.
B008C40218|5.0|Heard a cut on the radio, previewed on rdio and then purchased the CD. I love these guys and the CD is great.
0765325950|1.0|The final book, that I have been waiting for 13 years for was a total let down.<br /><br />The majority of the book has to do with individual battle tactics, most of them not even focusing on the main characters.<br /><br />-------Spoiler---------<br /><br />Thom was mentioned in like 3 places.<br /><br />Moiraine makes her great comeback from the dead at the very beginning of the book to then be left out of almost the entire story.<br /><br />The characters seemed to have absolutely no driving force, all running around like chickens with their head's cut off. Following any story in this book is difficult, as new and worthless extra characters are added that give nothing to the story line but filler.<br /><br />The Final Battle is entered into with Rand bravely walking into the pit, and engaging in 300 pages of conversation and blather reminiscent of his trip through Rhuidean. I looked at my book today and realized there were only about 10 pages left, and the dark one STILL hadn't been vanquished. I can sum up those pages here: \\"Rand changed his mind, locked the dark one back in prison and appeared to die, but he had just changed bodies. Oh, and everyone else pretty much died. Flowers on the hill.\\"<br /><br />What rubbish. 700 pages of mindless filler, and the end of 14 books, the great finale, after reading for 13 years and almost 10,000 pages, the great battle, having been foretold since about page 200 of the first book, is wrapped up in such an offhand manner that it may has well have been someone finishing eating a pie. Elayne took longer baths than this final battle royale between good and evil.<br /><br />I would not recommend.
1609611543|5.0|I you ever read Wheat Belly, you'll believe you should never eat wheat again. A must read if you don't feel well or are on too many prescriptions.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Reacher? Puller? Alarm clocks in head and addicted to coffee. Yes, it may be a Lee Child's Reacher clone, but this book was a great read that I throughly enjoyed! Read it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Entertaining!  As a horse lover I was surprised at the game's entertainment level. I do wish it could move a little quicker in levels without having to pay.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|If you love this movie, this is one where the BluRay is worth every penny.  It's really cleaned up and you can tell the difference in the scenery, the colors and clarity of picture.  Also a big improvement in the sound.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|This is a movie that ranks up there with classics like Midway, The Longest Day, and Saving Private Ryan.  And, it teaches a valuable lesson about race and that the desire to serve has often been a harder battle for some than combat in some ways.  My hope is that someone will some day take on such an epic movie about the 442 Japanese Americans who became the most decorated group in. WWII.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This item was something I have been wanting for a while.  The price was good, the box was new and wrapped so you knew it had never been used.  The only thing I missing is someone to play with now.  Thank You!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|It was a quick, easy read, but nothing special. The writing was fairly simplistic, and the plot was pretty straightforward. Good for adolescents.
0765325950|5.0|I could hardly wait for this book to arrive.  Amazon offered it at a better price than my reg book club did.  The book was new, cover was perfect and no problems with shipping.  ThankYou!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this several times a day to relax....Am looking for ways to still find moves when the computer says there aren't any more moves...A real challenge...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|very nice upgrade. it still lags like at times but not as much as the first one. its refreshing to have the different levels and obstacles.
B004GYY714|5.0|No matter what your mood, there's a selection of music here for you....Great alternative to the same old stuff on the radio....Music you won't find on a regular radio station....Love it...
B001AITGWE|5.0|Next to THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, this is hands-down my favorite Michael Douglas film...bar none. Between watching one man self-destruct and the second try to salvage his life, it's very touching and downright humorous...and tragic. Not many films have put such care into the characterization.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Expected this to be easy, but some numbers are hidden very well, and I've not been able to finish the puzzles that are required for moving along in the series....a good challenge.  Love it...
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I had a tough time getting into the book as the beginning was a bit slow but after it picked up I couldn't put it down. It turned out to be nothing like what I had expected when I bought the book. I was thinking horror but it's more sci-fi. I really enjoyed the ending when everything fell into place and I finally understood the thought process behind the story.
B009FZFONO|4.0|best zombie tv show ever!!..this show is like no other on TV watch it and love it YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for the famoly to enjoy. we love seeing who can  beat the games first. really lovebthe games they are very challengeing
B00499QUK2|5.0|The season ran without any interruptions!<br />I will definitely watch other movies and tv shows now<br />Thank you so much
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Christmas gift. I hope I can borrow it.  Only disappointment is that I'm in Canada and that the UV digital copy only works in USA.<br />This makes the point of buying it if you're Canadian...if you want the digital copy...redundant.  Too bad...no more  paying more for a digital UV copy for me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun games some are hard to figure out how to play u only get 8 games initially and u have to win them to gain access to more
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well done, triumph of the foul mouthed nerds.  Many laugh out loud moments, and many more intense techno how's-he-gonna-get-out-of-that moments.  A fun read.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Seasons I - IV should come complete with a notice from the Surgeon General's Office: \\"Warning. THE MENTALIST may be addictive to anyone unfamiliar with great television.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Well\\" (I hear you thinking), \\"maybe just ONE season.\\" Fool not yourself, Gentle Viewer. Simply bite the bullet and buy all four. Today. Right now. For one thing, they are a joy to watch sans commercials.<br /><br />  I'm sure those who've managed to find their way here unaided know enough about the cast and particulars to go on with, and they have probably already figured out that the show is stunningly brilliant. Yes, it is Sherlock Holmes in modern garb with a twist, but it is so much more.<br /><br />  THE MENTALIST, in fact, lays almost every icon and cliche of the whole mystery/crime genre on its ear, and, in some cases, goes them all one better. Just one \\"for instance\\" will suffice (half the fun is searching out the others): there are two variations (so far) on MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. In addition, there are elements from many and diverse television dramas of the past, from THE FUGITIVE and PERRY MASON and THE AVENGERS to (\\"Patience, Grasshopper\\") STAR TREK. Yes, STAR TREK (Kimball Cho as Spock?). Bruno Heller knows - as did Gene Roddenberry - that an audience needs a cast they can care about, which means a group of well developed characters who care about each other.<br /><br />  I'm not sure Mr. Heller did all this on purpose, mind you (Well.......), but the fact is that some of THE MENTALIST episodes - to say nothing of the seasons themselves - have as many layers and contain as many traditions as the HARRY POTTER novels, including Jane Austen's penchant for misdirection, but it is certainly great fun thinking along those lines whether or not.<br /><br />  And really, what more can we ask. The series IS great fun. Treat yourself and buy it. Watch it with friends who are unfamiliar and not yet addicted. You will NOT be sorry.

THE MENTALIST may be addictive to anyone unfamiliar with great television.\\"<br /><br /> \\"Well\\" (I hear you thinking), \\"maybe just ONE season.\\" Fool not yourself, Gentle Viewer. Simply bite the bullet and buy all four. Today. Right now. For one thing, they are a joy to watch sans commercials.<br /> I'm sure those who've managed to find their way here unaided know enough about the cast and particulars to go on with, and they have probably already figured out that the show is stunningly brilliant. Yes, it is Sherlock Holmes in modern garb with a twist, but it is so much more.<br /><br /> THE MENTALIST, in fact, lays almost every icon and cliché of the whole mystery/crime genre on its ear, and, in some cases, goes them one better. Just one \\"for instance\\" will suffice (half the fun is searching out the others): there are two variations (so far) on MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. In addition, there are elements from many and diverse television dramas of the past, from THE FUGITIVE and PERRY MASON to STAR TREK. Yes, STAR TREK (Kimball Cho as Spock?).  Bruno Heller knows - as did Gene Roddenberry - that an audience needs a cast they can care about, which means a group of well developed characters who care about each other.<br /><br /> I'm not sure Mr. Heller did all this on purpose, mind you, but the fact is that some of THE MENTALIST<br />episodes - to say nothing of the seasons themselves - have as many layers and contain as many traditions as the HARRY POTTER novels, including Jane Austen's penchant for misdirection, but it is certainly great fun thinking along those lines whether or not.<br /><br /> And really, what more can we ask. The series IS great fun. Treat yourself and buy it. Watch it with friends who are unfamiliar and not yet addicted. You will NOT be sorry.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Just the  right amount of  Tec. Which made it believable,I like the character watney. He overcame every challenge put to him by dealing with it one at a time.great book I would recommend this book to every one.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have the free version of this game on my kindle fire.  So far there are no issues.  I've been playing for a few days now.  I love the features like showing only edge pieces.  Great selection of puzzles too.
B005LA3Z9M|3.0|From this book I learnt how powerful the message of the flowers in our daily lives are. No wonder they create such an emotional response from people.<br /><br />I also learnt about the terrible emotional black hole which comes about if a child is not loved wholeheartedly and unconditionally in their formative years.
B00AH34AUQ|3.0|My issue with TRE is the same issue I have had with UNO and DOS. This is just bland and feels rushed. The album overall is passable. Passable in the sense that it doesn’t fail at its goal and you could also pass it by and not miss much. It is commendable to try and push out 3 albums in such a short amount of time. The problem is if you need to pick and choose songs from each to make one solid album, your effort to be unique was wasted. In an age of mp3’s and playlists, 80% of the songs on UNO, DOS, and TRE will never get a second listen.<br /><br />I don’t want to sound like jaded entitled snob or anything but the lackluster outcome of this project is going to make me approach their next work with hesitation and lowered expectations.<br /><br />Listen to the samples. It may be more cost effective to buy the two songs you will enjoy.<br /><br />- A loyal fan of 15 years.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Awesome app that is great for keeping track of batterie charge and health. Lots of great features like line plot and notification settings. I highly encourage to buy this perfect app at its perfect price.
B004EWFUQY|1.0|This is not a good way to lose ten pounds or less--it is too restrictive and unsustainable. Maybe for people who are seriously overweight and under a doctor's care.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because it was fabulous reading I would recommend everyone to read this series I read it 8 times a co-worker read it also. She read it 9 times.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|Great bedtime reading. It's amazing that after all these years it's still timely and suspenseful. I guess that's why it's a classic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Need to buy no mader what. You should play with a friend or family members. You can KILL HEROINE and get skins.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|I've never written a review, but it's high time for me to come out from the anonymous shadows of the internet and put my money where my mouth is. First and foremost, as if the star rating didn't give it away, I found this movie very enjoyable. However, I'm writing this review today not as praise for all its rights, but as a defense for all its wrongs. Many of the reviews I've read find the movie bland, flat, and without flare. However, given the genre it's heavily persuaded by, the American 70's kung-fu theater, this is an out and out homage to that time period and culture. The dialogue has been cited as \\"terrible\\", but honestly, who watched kung-fu movies for the dialogue? Yes, it sets the story and yes, it advances the plot, but generally most people are there to watch people beat the snot out of each other. Personally, I found the writing fine, but that's not what this review is about.<br /><br />Another personal favorite of the less than positive reviews is pointing out the unimaginative scenery and characters. Jungle Village. Brass Body. However, again, this is a tribute to the kung-fu theater of yesteryear. Most of the poorly dubbed movies of that era suffered from extremely simple translations and thus had direct, to the point naming conventions. This is also why, as stated in the previous paragraph, the dialogue comes off as flat, or even overly acted with no substance. Again, a call back to the cinematic era it's referencing. To be honest, though, most Asian languages are very direct in their naming. For instance, Japan in Japanese is \\"Nihon\\", with \\"Ni\\" meaning sun and \\"hon\\" meaning source, so Japan, land of the rising sun. Get it?<br /><br />Now, I've only seen a few references to this next particular issue, but I feel it must be addressed, and that is the soundtrack. Some have said the hip hop seems out of place and my only retort would be, \\"Have any of you seen Samurai Champloo?\\" That is a quintessential example of the perfect harmony between hip hop andthe ancient Asian culture and I believe it works here as well.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I'm sure many of you have stopped reading or simply made up your own mind long ago and I wouldn't be able to sway you otherwise. However, for those that have trudged along this far, I implore you to watch this film with an open mind and a laid back attitude, appreciating for what it is: a homage to a simpler time in theater. This isn't a 13 Assassins or a Hero or a Zatoichi, this is a man professing his love to a cinema that he is so fond of. I tip my hat to thee, RZA.
0307346617|5.0|Now, The Zombie Survival Guide [[ASIN:1400049628 The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead]] is a cool funny book. But this book is fantastic! Max Brooks has grown leaps and bounds as an author. He takes us into so many different perspectives, and uses a fantastical background to do so. Bravo! Great work. Am curious to see how much Hollywood might mess it up. After all, zombies are already amongst us - they're called Studio executives :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is da best hand held device game ever just wanna say keep up da good work. Love the new maps, character's, and the surf boards n I hope there more to come love you guys
1419553429|4.0|This book is fairly good, especially if you are seriously aiming for a 700+ on the GMAT. It is more difficult than other books from Kaplan and other publishers, but then it is meant for advance preparation. Hence, it is recommended not to directly go for this book if you've just started with your GMAT prep. The book has a huge number of carefully selected examples and practice questions which are very lucidly explained by the authors. You will also find many tips and tricks throughout the book that further aid in solving problems quickly. Both verbal and quant sections are taken care of perfectly. All in all if you want a 700+ score, then this is the book for you. Moreover, if you are fairly comfortable with the level of questions in this book, then you can surely expect a great score on your GMAT.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I would reccomend this! It was funny and fun. Story line is solid with great comedy moments. Watched it with young kids without fear... you can to.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Like many people I saw the movie first. But I gotta tell that the books are much more better. They are awesome. Totally loved t he story. Wish she would have ended up with Gale.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|But it wasnt as good as I hoped. It had some awesome action sequences based in a futuristic envornment. Tapered off a little soft but I would reccomend it.
B001B6EAOY|5.0|Use it to boost my second hand psp, that I make music on and play my Beatles colletion from in the car or on the fly. At home I play Vinyl Records. Anyway, with this adapter I now have combined a 32 and a 16 Gb card. Then in the psp you have to format the setup and viola, it works.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show!! The actors, the compelling story lines and the beautiful settings make this one of my favorite shows of all time. I can't wait to watch the next one!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it! I ride horses every week but when I'm not at the stables this is  fun too.  loads quickly. no glitches.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|When you think Coin Dozer, you usually think that suckish arcade game that steals your tokens and as a kid in the 90s and millennium and even a bit before those times, you just didn't get it and didn't see the point. It was so simple it was boring.<br />Well I must say when this kindle version of Coin Dozer kept popping up as an ad on my Prize Claw app, time after time again, and I saw it was free to purchase, I thought &quot;what the Heck? Let's try it and see.&quot; It's the same arcade game you remember as kid, you drop coins and it pushes them down the line (big surprise there) but what I wasn't expecting was what Game Circus added to the traditional Coin Dozer game to make it more app friendly as well as entertaining to all ages; Game Circus added a complete fair grounds background puzzle you fill in with prizes that drop on the line (much like Prize Claw has some), plus they've also added basic prize drops and &quot;specialty coins&quot; that make the game more interesting and fun. While it is a great improvement from the original in real life arcade version of this game, I still would not pay even $0.50 for this game. It's a good thing it's free cause that's pretty much what it's worth. Game Circus might be able to raise the price someday if the graphic approve and it's more modern and high-tech looking, but until then free is the perfect price for this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. I would recommend this game to all my friends. I would incourge you to try this game out.:)
B00APJLX8E|1.0|Tried multiple attempts to download and watch this movie with my kids but no success. Attempted to contact Amazon about the problem for a refund and they still haven't responded :/

B000YJ6736|4.0|An acutely observed interplay of a shy couple's emotions at a time when young people were barely emerging from the shadows of a Victorian upbringing. Insufficiently versed in life's potential difficulties their inability to connect at a realistic level destroys their chances for life's fullest riches. Short and sad.

B00A6L78YE|5.0|Other reviewers have already written more intelligently about this album but I just had to throw in my 2 cents.  When I listen to Foxygen it doesn't sound like a modern band trying to replicate the sound of a 60's band.  It feels like someone made an amazing discovery of recordings of a band from that generation that had somehow never been heard until now.  And they also happened to be the best band of that generation.<br /><br />Even though this year has just started I can't imagine another album coming out this year that I will like more than this one.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was a good ending to a great series. I liked the ending that I did not see coming.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|Dark in substance and quallity. Shot mostly at night in unspectaular locals even the casino was dark and uninteresting. The high points were the opening and ending. The metrosexual bad guy showed promise but needed more character development.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|I enjoyed the improbability of a 100 year old, writing history, outwitting the law and society in a most enjoyable read.
B008GWSS6W|5.0|I had heard nothing but negative reviews of the various video editions of McLintock due to its apparently falling into public domain status. I was hoping to see a decent copy, but was unprepared for the razor sharp, incredibly detailed picture I experienced here. It was almost three-dimensional. I'm almost afraid to order the blu-ray version, as I am unsure it can equal the quality of the presentation I witnessed in this VOD.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Have the series and wanted to re watch to see if I missed anything. And have shared it with friends.
B000LJ9ZWO|4.0|Love to watch these great old movies as the new ones dont compare at all. Even my 8 year old liked this one:-)
B004LROMSO|5.0|really a great series, waiting to order the second season when i get some money saved. puts a different picture on camelot
B0096Y6EUG|4.0|Paul Simon is one of my favorites, so of course I snagged this album.  Overall, it's a good listen.  My biggest gripe is that I usually expect live performances to be either rather faithful to the original version, or to do something entirely unexpected with the song.  Most of the songs on this album fall under the faithful header, and those songs work well.  Unfortunately, most of the songs that fall under the \\"do something different\\" header are the Graceland songs, but in this case I don't think the new arrangements work.  In fact, it's somewhat fascinating to hear what Graceland might have sounded like if Paul had never enlisted the talents of South African musicians and instead made a normal \\"American\\" record.  And of course I have 25+ years of listening to Graceland to put me firmly in a box of what it's \\"supposed\\" to sound like, but all-in-all I didn't care for the arrangements of the Graceland songs here.  They lack the effervescence of the original South African musicians.  In some cases, I would even say the songs are robbed of the beautiful fusion of cultures by making them \\"too American,\\" and the result is just awkward.<br /><br />Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes has a rather lame opening a capella segment that tries to capture the exquisiteness of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, but instead ends up being a slow Gospel-ish number complete with hand claps, and it's really just sad.  Luckily, the remainder of the song is quite enjoyable, and manages to remain faithful to the original while embellishing here and there for a bit of flavor.<br /><br />Throughout the performance, Paul also deviates from the vocal melodies we are used to, and usually that's something exciting but in my opinion Paul is a little too liberal in the ad libs...it starts to sound like he's singing a harmony part and the lead mic is turned off.  Or maybe he's trying to show everyone that he can still hit those notes in the high register with grace, even at age 70 (and yes, he can...that isone of the joys of the album).<br /><br />All that said, it's a fine group of musicians playing an outstanding set of songs to an energetic and appreciative crowd.  I don't regret my purchase, and I've enjoyed it a number of times already, but this is probably one that's for the fans.  Give it a once-over on Spotify before committing to the purchase if you're curious.
B000HF6ZR0|5.0|IT SHOWS GOD BROUGHT THE EAGLES NEST DOWN OUT HIS HIS HEAVENS. THE SCRIPTURES ARE PLAIN SPOKEN. I ENJOYED THE MOVIE IN LIGHT OF THE ASPECT OF GODS HOLY WORD.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abby-season 3.  great movie, can't stop watching till I have seen it all.  Too long to wait each week to see on the public channel.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Would rate it a four but it has ads not that I would have expected anything else.nothings free in life. In any case it's good enough, and helps pass the time.
B0083WLKBA|5.0|Didn't watch when it first was on,  my children raved about it, so I ordered and watched the first 2 seasons in 1 week.  Grear
B001EIOOV8|5.0|The film itself gets 5 stars IMO, but the way it was filmed, combined with the bright lights of Las Vegas, makes this one of the most beautiful cinematic experiences i have ever had. Really sold me on the difference between standard def vs HD.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|very pleased with my purchase, I will recommend this person to all my friends and family , very easy to work with
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a big fan of the show and I love the ease of purchasing it through Amazon Instant Video. I never have to think about it with the Season Pass and I love being able to download it to multiple devices. I only wish that it was available on AIV the same time it was broadcast on the network.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this shows kid how to take care of animals. This is a great responsibility. But it has an easy part to iit
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive.Once you play it you don't want to stop.<br />Subway Surfers.... Maybe my most liked game EVER

B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This movie was honestly the best I have seen all year. I am a huge fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's works and this not only does the book justice, but illuminates the series as a whole as well!
B000I9W08I|5.0|It is great to be able to buy loved movies at a great price.  Hello Dolly is wonderful and fun to view!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is really fun! the only problem I have had to uninstall and reinstall 3 times. it gets me so far and quits recording my progress. not sure what to do about it! hopefully the third time is a charm as they say!

B009CPES4I|5.0|This is a beautiful story of how to LIVE in the golden years.  The acting is top knotch and I can see why it would be up for an academy award.  Lovely, lovely, lovely story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love love love it. Probably one the best books I've read in a very long time. I'm already halfway done with book number 2
B005LAIIJY|5.0|He sounded nothing like how he sounds in the commercials. He does really great voice alterings! I hope they incorporate this film into the commercials!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Riviting.  Holds your attention and makes you want to keep reading to the end without stopping.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves action and suspense.
B007REV4YI|1.0|Okay, Javier Bardiem was AMAZING in this movie!! There is no reason why he shouldn't have gotten nominated for Best Supporting Actor this year for the Oscars!!!! It's so stupid! He would have for sure won! He was definitely better than pretty much everyone else who was nominated this year (except maybe Tommy Lee Jones for Men In Black 3). This was the best role of his lifetime! Maybe he'll get the nod for the next Bond film.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was an interesting story. I enjoyed seeing how the Seals work.<br />It was an easy read and the plot was good.
B00821PCJS|4.0|It's a Spielberg movie so that explains why it's pretty good most of the time.  If you like aliens and sci fi this is for you.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Excellent movie, great.actors, good pucture and real situations! Has drama and comedy well integrated. Getting old and broke is not an easy topic, but this movie capture the drama in a very unique way. Definitely a must to see!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great storyline and acting. I love stories that remind me of the time in history.... I like the scenery and animals as well...
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|If this movie had 2 normal people in it and not a teddy bear it would of never been made. Not a fan of family guy so my review might not count but wanted to like it my kind of humor. Just because it is a teddy bear doing these things (bong hits, curse words ect.) makes it funny not in my book.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|I just watched this movie again... it is rare to find a movie that is as good or better as we watch it again... this one is a very good example...
B0014KFV6I|5.0|This album is awesome I am so glad that I bought it. Every song is a great creative masterpiece! Wow!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app comes in handy when at the grocery store or wherever you need to figure pricing or with homework. Very much worth the download.
B00340LM8C|5.0|Classic romance, beautiful people, great acting terrific direction, engaging story. A movie for all seasons.<br />Starring the legendary Cary Grant and the lovely princess Grace Kelly in dazzling outfits and set in the French Rivera.<br />Makes you feel good.
0547884591|3.0|This isn't really a cookbook.  It is a book, at its heart, about learning.<br /><br />If you have read any of Ferriss' other books, you know that Tim Ferriss writes about how to maximize your results while minimizing your efforts.<br /><br />My problem with this book isn't the content or the writing, but with how much information is presented.  Since the book is almost 700 pages, there is going to be tons of information and while almost all of it is fascinating on its own, in the context of a book on learning...it was just too much.<br /><br />I think I would have happily paid for 2 books that were laid out a little bit better.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I love all Batman movies and this one was no exception.  Christian Bale was an excellent portrayer of Batman.  I could watch it again.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|You need to buy this game. Yes it's 30 bucks but this game is EPIC!!! Just buy it!!! I LOVE THIS GAME
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This is one of the best Bond films I have ever seen. Not over the top with gadgets to pull out that were imployed seconds before he ever knew he would need them, but simple plain Agent talent and athletics.<br /><br />The storyline takes you in from the VERY beginning and holds you tightly until the end. The villian is very believable and very creepy. Even after seeing this film I am strongely considering its purchase.<br /><br />If you want realistic excitment and a very talented cast surronding an excellent plot then you will not be dissapointed watching this film. 3 thumbs up! =)<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.

B0041KKYGU|1.0|I caught this DVD on an Amazon Holiday 2012 deal, and ending up paying something like 96 cents for it. Which in my opinion, (after watching maybe 1/3 of the movie) was 96 cents too much.
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|Excellent Movie all the extras and near perfect HD quality I would tell anyone to check it out great comedy!1
B000EUDAWG|5.0|This is a very neat toy to give a child. Our daughter fell in love with it but our son felt it was a little too realistic.

B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was totally awesome!!! I love action packed books. I am also really happy that Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter finally meet. I can't wait till I read the next one. I bet it's gonna be better than The Lost Hero and The Son of Neptune combined. And I just hope that the story goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.....................etc.
1844137872|5.0|This is well thought out and captivating art. Several of Banksy pieces of street art in LA had to be removed because they were causing too many auto accidents. Great art demands that you look at it. Now you have it all in a handy book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I saw my cousin playing this game Anne I was bored snf looked it up and started plaint a magical adventure
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This game is a lot of fun, easy to use and all functions work properly but it does occasionly freeze up my phone and I have to shut down. It also take up a lot of battery. Overall a good app but if the small probelms could be worked out would be great.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson manages to wrap up the series in brilliant fashion. For those who have stuck with the series this long there is no doubt that you are going to read this no matter what I say, but I still totally recommend that you read it.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I have alot of fun with is app, it is easy to use. I mostly use it to play around with photos I have taken with my Kindle.
B0017TFLBQ|3.0|At first I didn't notice the DVD part so I tried to install it on my old computer, a windows xp, since it's an older game. But that old computer couldn't read DVDs so I installed it on my new computer, a windows7, which does not support this old game. It installed and is playable but crashes every now and again so I have to save my game often. It was a good deal.
B00846F1YW|2.0|Very easy game to play but frustrating to use on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone. Especially when objects are hidden behind the menu box that you CAN'T move and when you have to use a flashlight your finger moving the flashlight beam around covers up most of the lit area. Disappointed even though it was free. Uninstalling.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's worth the money trust me I got mad at some features but there is always NEW updates love it highly recommend it for people who love to build and endless fun
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This is an excellent film. Colin Firth and Geofrey Rush both gave stunning performances. Colin Firth was remarkably able to convey the frustations of someone whose stammer was so debilitating. Imagine the humiliation of having to deal with that issue while representing his father the King in public!<br /><br />While the film takes some minor liberties with history, it movingly tells the facts of how young Bertie (the  future King George VI) was treated by his father, George V, and other members of the Royal family. Young Bertie's childhood was dreadful, but his was not unlike that of so many children of the aristocracy of the time. In his case, unfortunately, it lead to the stammer that was rediculed by his family and looked upon as being unacceptable for the &#34;spare&#34; to the throne.<br /><br />King George VI was well-known for his quicksilver temper, but he was also known for his deep compassion for others, particularly his subjects who suffered so terribly during World War II.  By all accounts he and his consort, Elizabeth, had a strong, happy marriage and created a loving atmosphere for their two daughters, the future Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret Rose.<br /><br />He never wanted to be King, but as it turned out he was the right person for the job at the time, when the abdication of Edward VIII (David, as he was known to his family) forced the position upon him. Never  before had a British monarch abdicated, so he had no precedent to follow. His relationship with Winston Churchill saved Britain during the War.  Many historians believe that Edward VIII would have formed a distructive pact with Adolf Hitler had he remained on the throne.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|The books were so thrilling that you couldn't put then down, but then the ending is left unfinished and a bit disappointing
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr, Alexander has written a Fascinating book, it is well written, and very spiritual.  It tests ones sense of the unknown
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I have been hooked on the Mentalist ever since the first episode and I always will be.  I hope it goes on for many years to come and I will purchase every season as it becomes available!!!!!  I love everyone in it and they all seem to be just the right persons for their parts.  That does not happen very often.  And the stories are always good and my older grandkids can watch them without worry of bad language or nudity.  This program is proof that all of that &#34;extra&#34; stuff they think is needed to gain an audience is just not necessary. Thanki you to the actors and the writers!!!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|this is a wonderful video.  I have enjoyed all three seasons and hope there will me many more.  thanks for the quick service
B000HL0EEE|5.0|Started watching the series but is was withdrawn.  Only saw the first few shows.  Hope it comes back I was just getting into it.
B00AA0U05A|3.0|This cd is ok.  I like some of the songs on this cd but not all of the songs.  Thanks
B000SEGTI0|5.0|When I started the novel, it sort of dragged on a little with the introduction to the world in which Deckard lives ... but slowly, as he begins the hunt on the killer androids, meets Rachel, and the introduction to Pris, it jams into high gear. There is so much more to explore in the novel than the movie because it unto itself is a larger volume.<br /><br />However, I feel the film is amazing in its own right, the novel just gives you a little more and does an amazing job keeping you wanting more page after page.
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|I had absolutely no expectations when i watched Warrior and was pleasantly surprised! There's a troubling family struggle between 2 brothers and their father. Layer that on with some pretty intense mixed martial arts and you've made a better modern-day Rocky flick. I have to admit, i'm not one to follow MMA or boxing but this movie really surprised me.
B007GATVYI|5.0|My company really raved about this book and asked my department to take a look at it. Having done this with many companies before I was expecting something more corporate, but this book is a very fun and easy read!!<br /><br />Very inspiring and touches on some of the things I myself have been trying to accomplish at work! Can't wait to implement this at my next meeting!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this version, let's you do so many things, I am doing a 365 reading to read the whole bible. It bookmarks, highlights, just joyful to read!!!

B008745B32|3.0|I have watched this movie several times and absolutely loved it, but I found the book to be very boring and difficult to get through.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could only make it half way through this book. I found it to be incredibly boring and written at an elementary level (content aside). I don't get all the hype about this book.
0307341550|3.0|A well written tale of nasty, backstabbing, soulless individuals who gouge at each others eyes in the midst of their boozing and whining. There is a main plot about a serial killer of little girls. The main character is a young woman who cut herself until she ran out of skin, drinks in miserable seclusion, works as a journalist (perhaps the most depressing aspect of her life),who returns to her hometown in pursuit of a story. Windy Gap is a nightmarish little burb where the meanest witch is her own mom, and the rudest child her little sister. The intrepid reporter uses all of her manipulative tricks to worm herself into the living rooms of grieving mothers, the better to glean some detail of their lives which may save her career, already dead but still twitching. When the parents of the murdered start to throw her out she tells them \\"We want to be fair to you and your family,\\" but she knows that fairness has no part in this story.<br /><br />I did not find this novel to be a page turner, more of a slow moving mystery which serves as the back story for the personal problems of the protagonist, her sad and wicked family, and a very sad town in Southern Missouri. The author kept my interest at a low, steady level, although I sometimes found myself glancing at my stack of books yet to be read.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn describes this with convincing realism and a flair for pathos. I didn't like this novel, but I liked the writer. She tells it all with an honesty and openness that hides nothing. It that is your cup of tea, drink deep of this little happiness crusher of a story. No one said that novels had to be fun or uplifting. Sometimes when we wallow in the gutter we can't see the stars at all.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Such beautiful completed pictures & lovely music to accompany the game!<br />I have recommended it to friends who also became instantly addicted!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I loved this season!  Donna was a strong-willed companion, but she had a funny side too.  I also loved her grandfather, Wilf.  His love and respect for the Doctor was very touching.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|first time i've ever played this, found it fun and relaxing. do this when i don't have much time and want  something to play.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Not enough levels.  No where to spend the \\"DD\\"s that you earn.  Try making more levels to the game. Overall ok. Still no new levels. (UPDATE) Once you complete the levels it is just a waste of space.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|This is the best trainer app I have used so far. It is customizable, has good video and voice prompting. The only thing that would make it better would be linking to you your calendar.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|After downloading and installing printbot, I found out it doesn't work with my printer. A better compatibility list in the online documentation would be nice.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Wish there were more episodes. These really encompass the tone of the books and is as entertaining, if not more, than the TV show House. My husband found these, and they are excellent. The finale is exceptional.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this!! It's hard to stop watching! I'm telling you some of the characters make you laugh while others are horrifyingly unkind.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|again this is a relaxing and fun to do. this is my &#34;i want to do something&#34; games. doesn't require much from me, just enjoy the process.
0062082353|5.0|the book came with tattered edges to the pages. HOW ANNOYING! Sloppy production. Sure, we may want the book asap, but not with lack of care.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I just love this book. I read it when it first came out years ago and loved it then. Wen the movie recently came out, I read it again and loved it just as much.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Favorite TV show, so far nothing comes close to this, not even some of my old favorites.  I just got the books not too long ago, can't wait to start reading them!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I LIKE it  when  Percy battled Ares.I LIKE it when they went to the underworld. I LIKE the Master bolt.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|I wasn't too sure about this game, but I downloaded it to check it out.  My son loves it.  He gets to grow fruits and veggies, rake leaves, mow the lawn.  Just today in the grocery store he was getting a bit crabby, I gave him this game to play.  Kept him busy the whole trip.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|this is not my kind of games, so did not like it at all. running and jumping is my my thing.
B000002QWD|3.0|Except for Whiote Christmas, it sounded pretty much likt the other one,  I think I willl enjoy playing it next year.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|of all the  money i shell out for movies, i have  yet seen a WHOLE MOVIE without it cutting  off somewhere in the movie  amazon always blame the internet system  i blame  amazon  I SURE  YOU WILL DELETE THIS  THE TRUTH  HURTS
B007REV4YI|5.0|I've seen this movie a couple times in theaters and this is probably one of my favorite Bond movies.  In my opinion, best Bond actor, Daniel Craig!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest offered an great ending to Stieg Larsson's series. I enjoyed the twists it took during Lisbeth's recovery & trial. A must read if you enjoyed the first two.
B008MEM24S|5.0|We love this game at our house.  It's fun, and it really makes you think on how to move the water around to get it where you need to.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|9 CD's - 100 songs. All of Abba's music over their entire career. So many songs never heard in USA if you only listened to music on the radio, this is THE definitive collection and worth any price to hear the greatest music created and performed by the most amazing band ever.
B006O6FK2W|2.0|Typical cheap Chinese junk. Good if you want quantity under the tree but this was discarded a week after Christmas.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|All seasons of Suits have been worthwhile watching, and I don't watch TV programming in general so my thumbs up is an enthusiastic one. Clever writing and casting, smart and funny and there's only seldom anything cliche-ish. Wardrobing is terrific with lots of well-chosen designer ensembles--though the female characters are sometimes unrealistically seductively dressed for a law practice.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I'm not having the troubles like others are having with it crashing in level 13 on my HTC DNA.  It's good with a little too much chat in the story. Thanks.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|This is by far the largest, most detailed LEGO set I have built and it provided me with nearly a week of evenings savoring the build.  It's amazing how LEGO manages to capture the shape and feel of the subject out of its existing inventory of pieces.<br /><br />This is definitely a 16+ age rated set.  There are two volumes of instructions, and even being as careful as I was, there were three or four times I had to backtrack either because I missed putting a piece in its proper possible or because I found I was missing a piece and wanted to make certain I didn't simply put the piece in earlier where it didn't belong.  I did end up with four missing pieces (one red-brown circle from the dash and three tan 1x squares from the roof rack.  I contacted LEGO and they gladly offered to send replacements.<br /><br />There's been a comment or two about how the roof doesn't stay on well.  In case there's anyone out there who hasn't already figured this out, the two roof pieces are loosely attached by design to allow for views of the interior.<br /><br />The sticker sets are tricky.  The clear window overlay stickers (two front and one rear) are a bear to locate properly and, because of the adhesive, repositioning the clear sticker causing the sticker to \\"fog\\".  I commented to LEGO about that and they said they would passed along the critique (no doubt not the only one they have received).<br /><br />Again, this is a great set, one I would definitely buy and set aside for later building and rebuilding and/or for your kids, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, etc.
B003O86FMW|5.0|AWESOME waiting for the movie to come out to see how close it is to the book. Books always seem better. But we will see.
B007M45PMU|3.0|The hit song Ho, Hey is great.  The rest of the album is OK, but none of the other songs stand out.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|Not too bad. Good entertainig little gem. The three main actors do a good job of keeping it all together.
B00005JKNC|4.0|A great clean movie!  Good for the whole family.  Makes for a great movie night.  Makes me remember why I used to like watching movies!
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I have had this watch now for over 1 month - wear it all day, every day, only taking it off for a shower. There is no sign of wear, no sign of black coming off, no sign of bracelet damage - just a great watch.<br />I bought this for its slim look - I hardly notice it on my wrist - and the smart black image of the watch.<br />I am delighted with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone wanting a reliable, smart looking watch.<br />Yes, all it does is tell the time - that's what I want from a watch!<br />As regards previous comments about problems with the fastening - I don't understand why folk have problem - hook on, clip cover, clip safety - it is straightforward and easily done with your other hand.<br />A great watch!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is lots of fun with great graphics. Two thumbs up. MY grandchildren are gonna love playing for hours of entertainment.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is one of my FAVORITE shows.  I am always ready to see the next episode.  I love the story and the suspense.
0670026182|5.0|The pictures just draw you in and the commentary gives you a desire just to jump right and try each and every recipe.
B008JAGTNK|3.0|The previous of this movie got a hold of me, the movie itself took a little longer to get the story all set up.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A wonderful book and sorely needed in this age.  I highly recommend it if you are looking for something more in your life.
0440243688|5.0|Great writer--exciting from first page to last.....His Reacher series is wonderful.  I would highly recommend.....Start with book number one and work your way through....
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|An amazing, true adventure written by a proven writer.  I read it several years ago, and this rereading was just as exciting.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was amazing, I couldn't put it down! Can't wait to start on the next one. Well worth the price
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  It's a tie with NCIS for me. I love the cast and how well they all play their roles. I am a fan for sure.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|but has little to do with the old movie. Rather reminds me of a modern version of Robocop. But none the less: fun action movie with cool effects! Wonder what the movie was like in 3D...
B00846F1YW|4.0|A good mystery story, but some times the objects you have to look for are at the very top almost under the green banner at the top (played on a Kindle). Over all fun and interesting game, definitely a good buy.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Bought this animated film for the kids but my wife and I liked it so much we remained engaged throughout the movie. Animation is excellent. Acting by everyone is fantasic. Adam Sandler does an impressive job as do the rest of the cast of voices! The story combines classic horror tale (note: nothing terrifying in the movie) with modern theme, i.e., daughter wants to explore the outside world.<br />Great plot and good finish.<br /><br />Ultraviolet is NOT so good. Not compatible with Apple iOS devices unless you install another \\"App.\\"<br />\\"Digital Copy\\" should just support downloading into your iTunes account like other Digital Copy films do. I realize this is due to \\"Sony\\" not wanting to compete with Apple, but I will NOT purchase any more Blu-Rays that don't support Digital Copy on iOS devices. Will just purchase the film through iTunes store and will be able to watch on Apple TV and iOS devices.<br /><br />I took back the Blu-Ray (yes some retailers can be convinced to take returns) and purchased this film from iTunes for much less than the Blu-Ray + Digital Copy.<br /><br />I would like to remove a star for Sony's handling of digital content, but decided not to because the film is excellent.<br /><br />Happy viewing!
B000FC10MU|5.0|Simply the best book I have ever read. Everybody should read it. It's a masterpiece. I can't wait for a sequel.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|i bought the music before going to the movie . I loved the movie and the soundtrack. love it A+
0061978078|5.0|Pandemonium is the second novel in the Delirium trilogy by Lauren Oliver. The chapters switch off between two parts of Lena's life: Then and Now.<br />The Then chapters are right where Delirium left off, Lena in the woods after seeing Alex sacrifice himself to save her.  She stumbles around in the woods until she is rescued by a group of Invalids.  She is then taught by the leader of the group, Raven, that the past is dead.  That nothing matters but whats happening now.  That it's the only way to survive.  So slowly Lena attempts to forget about Alex, forget about Grace and the rest of her family, forget about Hana, forget about the old world.  She starts helping the group move to a new location to survive the winter.<br />The Now segments are a few months after the then chapters.  Lena has integrated herself with the resistance and is working undercover to bring love back to the society by getting rid of the cure.  She gets abducted by a group of scavengers with the poster-boy of the cure, Julian.  They are trapped together for a long time, and she starts to have feelings for him, and him for her.  The book ends on a cliffhanger that is bound to make the last installment in the trilogy the best yet.<br /><br />It's amazing to see how much Lena has changed as a character.  In the first book she was innocent, weak, and clueless.  Throughout this novel you get to see her transformation to a hard, angry character trying to forget Portland and the past she has there.<br /><br />As always, Oliver's writing style is stunning and beautiful beyond compare.  She pulls you into this story and makes you feel like you are part of the story, making it impossible to put down.  Pandemonium is so much better than Delirium.  It is faster paced with a better story line, and you get to see Lena develop from what's happened to her.  I would recommend this to anyone who read delirium, whether they liked it or not, since this book is so different and so much better.  Can't wait for Requiem!em!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's was an excellent book. It was leaving me wanting more.<br />I cannot wait to start part two of this series.
B008MM9630|3.0|I like playing this game but the new update through Amazon is taking too long. Everyone on the Facebook page seems to be playing the updated version with the wedding but I'm still stuck with Xmas theme.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Yeah...I'm old, I guess.  Too many people online using curse words & talking trash between games.  Not for me, I'm afraid.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this continuing saga of Downton Abbey and can't wait for more  episodes.  It shows that even the wealthy have their issues.  The servants have tales of their own.  It completely holds my attention.
B005I4JG80|5.0|This is the style of parenting that I had always known I wanted but didn't know existed somewhere - France! I firmly believe that keeping time for yourself is one of the best things that you can do for your family as a whole. You'll be more focused and effective as a parent if you also concentrate on yourself, something a lot of Americans need to learn.
0061726834|4.0|Delirium is set in a time period much like our own, except for love is a disease.  Every member of the society must be \\"cured\\" when they turn 18.  Everyone lives in fear of contracting the disease, including Lena.  Lena grew up in with a mother who's cure didn't work correctly, and her mother loved her husband and her children, which is against the law.  After he government found out, they took her mother and moved Lena to live with her aunt.  Now Lena is 17 and looking forward to her cure and being given her match, the boy she will marry.<br /><br />Along with her best friend Hana, Lena starts to question her society, little by little.  First by attending party with both boys and girls in attendance, playing music not approved by the government.<br />Then she starts to fall in love with a boy named Alex.  And slowly they fall into a lovely romance that they both know is forbidden.  Alex then starts to open Lena's eyes even more to the world around them as she realizes that it's not somewhere she wants to live anymore.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver has such a unique writing style, so beautiful and poetic that pulls you in and almost forces you to keep reading.  I literally couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a wonderful Dystopian romance.  I can't wait till the next one!

B007M45PMU|5.0|I can't quite understand why I, an old guy who loved the '60s, love this album, and every song on it.  It listen to it over and over, and the songs stick in my head.  It's some of the most interesting and infectious music I've heard.

B003V1WXKU|5.0|I've known generally about this book for years, but I didn't read it until recently! I thought it would be full of physics information conveyed in the the marvelously lucid manner that made Mr. Feynman so famous. I was a bit surprised to learn it was a bunch of semi-random stories from throughout his amazing life! These stories are a great insight into his intellect and more notably, into his hilarious sense of humor! We elevate such legends to celebrity status, and for good reason, but they are normal people just like us! This book show us the human side of a giant of the twentieth century! It was a joy to read! I couldn't put it down!

B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is terrible. I can't choose recent  news over top news cause the gear thing doesn't  do anything but raise my blood pressure. You can't delete comments and I need to do that cause I rant and then feel bad later. Terrible app.

0062082353|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Kyle doesn't hold back on his likes, dislikes, passions, and life-experiences. My admiration for the SEALS has grown through this honest and gritty book about life in the caldron of war and peace.

An easy to do, well explained with pictures and diagrams colour bible. You could also learn a lot about color regardless of the medium you use wehter it be paint, material, paper or clay like myself. I am a mixed media artist and am truely truely inspired by these beautiful knowledgable women. A fantastic book that I say is A MUST HAVE if you are serious about colour balance and matching, even your whites, grey's and blacks are graded. Just buy it, I promise you won't regret it :D

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of the most fun and challenging games I have played in ages! The levels start easy enough for kids and gradually get harder. Its so much fun to try to find the solutions! Love, love, love this game! YOU WILL TOO!!
B00846F1YW|1.0|Extremely repetitive. Finding the same objects over and over in different scenes and most of the time not having anything to do with the storyline.
B008PPUMVY|5.0|This is one of Franks high points.(There were several!)Its probably my favourite of all time.While I agree that part I is more cohesive and stronger as far as the musics concerned,parts II and III are chock full of great moments as well.If I have one complaint about this set it would be that some of the instumental passages go on a little too long.A minute or two shaved off of \\"Packard Goose\\",\\"Keep It Greasy\\"and also\\"He Used To Cut The Grass\\" and possibly adding a song with some narrative wouldve been preferred but again,a MINOR complaint.Now \\"Watermelon In Easter Hay\\" is about 9 minutes of instrumental BEAUTY!An absolutely stunning piece of work.I just wish someone would make a long form video of this classic album!
0345529057|5.0|Get the audiobooks too, if you can, so you can hear how many ways the names can be pronounced.  What a magnificent epic.
B000BBOUCW|4.0|good video if you really like final fantasy this is for you. It was just overall a good cgi flick.
B0000028UK|2.0|Used to have cd, lost it, and wanted it. If i had've known about the scratches on the the disc and that it didn't even lock in properly inside the cover i would've chosen a different avenue. Plastic wrapping was also tamperred with. Pissed off and not yet listened to it as, by the scratches, don't want even more disappointment!

B004W1GCNC|4.0|Not quite as good as Downton Abby, but very entertaining. I loved to see Rose back. More of the old cast would be fun. I watched most of the original series in the 70's...I think
B007GE2H3G|5.0|So, the bad guy is Steven Spielberg? This movie did the original comic books justice.  Lovely and fun to watch.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Absolutely love walking dead season 3, best so far of the series. Would highly recommend to watch all three seasons.

B00B0NDF26|4.0|Everyone is talking about the &#34;pop shift&#34; Tegan and Sara took on this album, but it feels like a logical evolution.  Listening to the lyrics, not much has changed - the themes are the same.  The songs are good, they are catchy.  There are a few filler tunes that are slower and cause some drag in the middle.<br /><br />I hope T&S take this approach further and do an entire album of short, poppy tunes.
B009P1WES6|5.0|Every so often a crime thriller comes along that leaves you breathless and takes you on a disturbing journey into the darkest recesses of human experience- `Alex' is one such book and you are guaranteed a tale of the unexpected from start to finish. Don't expect any spoilers or dwelling on the plot from me, as I want you all to be as surprised by this twisty tale as I was, but all I will say is, you are in for more than one shock or two along the way. Intriguing huh?<br /><br />The book opens innocuously enough with the kidnapping of a young woman, the eponymous Alex, but as the grim details of her incarceration unfold, and quite frankly, will probably haunt your dreams, she finds herself having to draw on every ounce of her own resource-fulness to survive and seek her escape. With the police seemingly at a loss to identify her and, to more importantly track her and her kidnapper down, what is it about this woman that eludes their detection and has forced a man to take such serious measures as to patiently stalk her, and then seek to watch her die in a pretty damn barbarous way? Well, I'm not telling, but suffice to say when the true nature of Alex's character and her ruthless sense of retribution are slowly revealed, you will be completely caught up in, and engaged with the expose of this remarkably determined and dangerous young woman- a woman who admittedly makes Lisbeth Salander look like Mary Poppins. But, and here's the clever bit, you will be wrongfooted at every turn in your emotional responses to her and this is where the genius of this dark tale lies.<br /><br />Outside of the sterling characterisation of the truly hypnotic Alex herself, Lemaitre proves he is no slouch at creating other compelling characters, as an integral part of the whole. Police Commandant Camille Verhoeven, who reluctantly discovers himself in charge of this initially mystifying case is a wonderful creation. Struggling with his own mental torment following the relatively recent kidnapping and murder of his wife, Verhoeven, a diminutive man in stature, but with the investigatory tenacity of a small terrier, takes a firm hold on the case, challenging those who seek to interupt his path of detection with a steely determination and a nice line in putdowns. As small as he is physically, his character looms large within the piece and his interplay with his colleagues Louis, intelligent and rich who drapes himself in designer clothing, and Armand, a scruffy individual who has taken cadging to a whole other level, is so plausible and engaging, that as the action pivots between Alex herself and the police investigation, there was to me a perfect mix of drama, poignancy and humour ingrained in Verhoeven and his close cohorts throughout. There are also by turns, some truly hapless and repellent characters who all play a strong part in the novel,  both in conjunction with Alex's actions, and in those who seek to undermine Verhoeven's grip on the case, despite the sense of urgency and professionalism he brings to the investigation. Quite simply,  Lemaitre provides a masterclass in characterisation throughout, and you will be appalled and delighted by his protagonists at every turn.<br /><br />Last, but by no means least, I would like to offer a special mention, to the translator Frank Wynne, who has not only peppered the book with some lovely- as we say in English- turns of phrase (sorry, this is a nod to a character- you'll understand it when you read the book) including `narked', references to `muppets' and even a `noggin', that injects the book with another level of humour, but has also produced a distinctly fluid translation that, to me, retains the nuances of Lemaitre's accomplished plot and characterisation, and elevates the enjoyment of this novel even more.<br /><br />An absolute gem of a crime novel that is wonderfully dark, scary,  mad, bad and dangerous to know, but just far too good to miss...ping and murder of his wife, Verhoeven, a diminutive man in stature, but with the investigatory tenacity of a small terrier, takes a firm hold on the case, challenging those who seek to interupt his path of detection with a steely determination and a nice line in putdowns.

B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|Often it felt as if the story was jumping from one place and thing to another without really explaining why, who or where. The same applies to the major entity Them, it could do with more character depth and explanation. It is possible that the reader will be given a clearer picture of Them in a sequel of course.<br />It could do with an edit for a few minor issues and the flow of the plot.<br />Some of the dialogue is a little stoccato and awkward. This seems to be more evident in the chapters that take place in the real world. The chapters in Everville have a better flow and the author seems more at ease.<br />I would suggest a small glossary to explain the Fron, Them, the Keeper and the Others in Between.<br />The author has a lot of creative and complex ideas. The intermingling of pillars in regards to faith and the soul. Or the crossover between worlds, which seem to be almost parallel.<br />It is a fantasy book with a YA feel to it. The main character and his friends are young students.<br />Overall I think it will appeal to readers who like their fantasy with a touch of youthful simplicity and at the same time wandering into the boundaries of complex worlds.<br />AVP-UK
0307279189|5.0|This book is very good. McDougall does a good job of blending ultrarunning with the culture of the Tarahumara Indians. One of the best running books I have ever read. You won't be disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Not sure how they do it, but I feel like I've watched an epic in every episode. The efficiency of British dialogue maybe ... The ongoing plots and subplots are advanced effortlessly, the acting is impeccable, and I laugh out loud on several occasions at Maggie Smith's character. I watched the third season back-to-back over one weekend as I found myself not wanting to wait to see what happened next. This season has some major developments, have fun ...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|What can I say about P v Z that hasn't been said before? This is probably my favorite game I've ever played on Android. Crazy Dave is hilarious the game play is fun too. It isn't too hard or too easy,
0446547573|1.0|There have been hundreds of books written with exactly this same theme. Why on earth does Sparks get paid so much money for a story that is completely unoriginal? Boring, boring, boring.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I couldn't wait for season 3 to start and it has not disappointed me. I only wish there were more episodes!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great way to keep in touch with our loved ones in our lives... Sometime it's overwhelming, but there is nothing to have a mobile version of Facebook.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|This app rocks. I had some video e-mailed to me from an iPad. I could not view the videos.<br />Checked around and found that this app has a good history.<br />Downloaded the app and it opened the movies straight away.<br />You have my thumbs up on this app.
B000Q4RJWW|4.0|Loved the movie in the theater and love watching it again. Who doesn't want to see their president fighting back against the bad guys!? Just wish there was less profanity.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I didn't like it.  Too teenagerish, not for me. Couldn't relate to the story or characters.  Characters still in high school.  Not for me
B006LSZECO|5.0|There are a few surprising twists in this novel about about a wife who goes missing.  A really good beach read!
B006M4F67A|3.0|What more can I say? You are in the middle of a game and it suddenly stops. Not fun when you are on a roll.
0312641893|5.0|Marissa Meyer has stumbled or deviously planned a brilliant pairing ~ SciFi & Fairy Tales ~ Who knew???  Well, thankfully Marissa Meyer knew!  I was shocked at how much I loved this story and desperately wanted more.<br /><br />I never thought I would enjoy a cyborg version of Cinderella.  But, the first 5 chapters were free and so I thought ~ Why Not?  I'm so glad I did!!!<br /><br />This is the first in what is scheduled to be a series ~ I believe 4 books in total, which does not include the little \\"teaser\\" stories like Glitches or The Queen's Army, both available here on Amazon or at Tor dot com ~ Both maybe 15 or so pages and just a little bit more info on characters that is nice to have, but not necessary for the stories.<br /><br />This is the not quite the classic re-telling of Cinderella, in my opinion it's even better ~ Full of all kinds of lovely twists and surprises ~ Cinderella (Cinder here) doesn't mope around hoping for someone to rescue her, she tries to figure out how to save herself, her prince and her world.<br /><br />This (in my opinion) is a very empowering fairy tale for girls.  Is there romance?  Yes, but the story doesn't revolve around the romance and Cinder isn't the type to lay down & die (or wish to die) if it doesn't work out.<br /><br />The characters are adorable ~ I especially love Iko ~<br /><br />As to the cliff hanger ending...  Well, let's just say you'll be glad Scarlet is already written and available for purchase.<br /><br />I say, skip the free first five chapters and order or download the full book ~you a bit more information on the character called Wolf in Scarlet.<br /><br />I gave each of my teenaged daughters copies of this book and I hope they enjoy it as much as I did.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read.  Unusual story line with a twist at the end.  Very heart warming story of young love.  Will not disappoint.
B007DIQAXI|1.0|Dont get me wrong, this band is AWESOME I own the CD and it is very good, however the Vinyl is no good. I have many many many great Vinyls and this one just does not sound right. Love the pink color
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is fun. You will spend hours playing. Then go back and beat your scores. Better game than some fancier ones.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written. Better than the movie. Couldn't put it down.  I got really drawn into the world. It's craziness. It's lack of color and yet crazy colorfulness the city. Can't wait to read the next two books.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is one of those songs that causes you to smile when you listen to it. One of those songs that makes you remember better times in the past.

B006TLFPKO|5.0|This was a great adaptation of the book and I cannot wait for part two to be released! Loved Amazon's instant purchase and the ability to watch on my iPad.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic acting, sets and historically correct.  The writing is fantastic! You really get to love the characters or hate them but you become a part of the household.  It is as if you are living it.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|If ever I felt good about highlighting a spoiler, this was the time.  When I started watching the 3rd season, I'd hoped that it could retain some of the magic of the first two seasons, but as I watched I started realizing that this was in fact the best Downton Abbey to date...until the last minute of the last episode, that is, when Matthew Crawley is killed in a car crash. Of course it never quite concluded, so Deus ex Machina can still save the day, and my hope is that my spoiler here, and that of countless others, will save the day and the writers will discard this ridiculous idea about a character who is really central to the whole idea of Downton Abbey.  Their choice to rescind this stupidity will determine whether the series has 4 seasons, or more, I think.  While he's not my favorite character, he really has become indispensable, and the sense of loss from his untimely departure would cloud the series way more than it would ever improve it.  A silly gesture, and I hope that the otherwise impeccable Downton Abbey will come to its senses here.  I rate the series up until the final minute or so at beyond 5 stars; the final minute is in the negative, because it destroys so much of what the series has been all about.
B006R1T40I|4.0|I'm a long time Bonnie Raitt fan from way back and was excited to see a new album from her with good reviews after all these years. Not her best work, but enjoyable nonetheless.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|I didn't think it was possible to bring this classic novel to animated film.  It was simply too detailed in the comic in my opinion.  I was wrong.  This nails it.  I think I've read the novel about 10-12 times because the storyline is just that compelling.  I'm probably going to watch this movie the same number of times.<br /><br />And that final battle between Superman and Batman....one word...EPIC.<br /><br />I paid to see Skyfall in the movies...that was a mistake.<br /><br />I would have paid to see this in the movies....happily.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I really enjoy watching this and other BBC shows. Watching it in HD isgreat, thank you very much for offering it.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I am actively job searching and needed the app so I could access away from computer and am very happy with it. I can do everything on mobile app that I can do from computer.
B00A18KCSQ|3.0|Having only had this album for a few days, I can only give my initial reaction at this point.  My first thoughts are that the album starts very strong...Inhaler, My Number (and my fave track) Bad Habit are great songs.  They continue on from the sound Foals laid out on their last album, TLF.  These first tracks are memorable, well crafted, and contain the same ingredients that made their best work so awesome in the past.  This said...at least so far...the rest of the album kind've blends all together for me.  Even after 5 or 6 listens, I can't really recall very much from the second half of the album.  Don't get me wrong...i pretty much like everything I have heard, it just seems to go a bit bland or samey at points.  Perhaps the reason why is that many of the later tracks seem to have a bit more of a conventional feel to them.  In addition, the lyrics are a bit on the obvious side.  For example, here is the chorus to Every time:<br /><br /> With every time I see you I want to sail away<br />With every time I see you I want to sail away<br />The lights won't bridge the gap through their holiday<br />With every time I see you I want to sail away, just sail away<br /><br />So...to recap...first three tracks are great....starts the album out in a very strong fashion.  But...as it progresses, so far anyway, it loses my interest a bit.  Overall, half great/half OK...what do I Score this?
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I totally loved this season and watched episode after episode with joy! If you like musicals, which I do, this is your kind of show. I'm looking forward to watching all of the episodes for previous seasons, and now have my dvr set to record all current episodes.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|Bought this at the same time as Psychedelic Pill. This was a pleasant surprise as Neil and the Horse take American Classics to a different level.
0307744434|1.0|I wanted so much to like this book, but in the end I didn't. It held me for the first few chapters, and then I started skimming pages just so I could get to the end. Full of long, languorous prose that says nothing, absolutely no action, an interesting conceit of switching points of view (and times of view) for the narration, but I couldn't wait for it to end. It was so obvious that our heroes were going to do something to subvert their challenge, and yet it was entirely unclear what it was they did. And quite frankly, by the end, I didn't care.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I really enjoyed this show the first time around. Watching it again in HD is even better, thank you very much for offering it.
1401235417|4.0|Amazing book. Fast delivery, with AP. Perfect in every way that I expected. it did come with one or two dents and marks on the paper cover for the book. Other than that, very satisfied. Issues #1-#7.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Helps pass the time on line at the store. Waiting for the bus. Easy to play, almost have to buy in app purchases too complete begining stages.
1451648537|4.0|It's a great book, but if you're a slow reader get ready. I found myself saying that I wish I had the audio book to go along with it so I could continue reading when driving or walking to class.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|100% recommended, the product arrived in perfect condition, is featured in the publication. I am very satisfied with the purchase you make
B000002NJS|5.0|I am a fan of Madonna's, I enjoyed this rare and difficult to find album.  Every song was quality and up to my expectations of Madonna.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it I  is awesome I think every on  should try to play it because it gets addictive after a while I lobe ten stars lol
B004LROUNG|4.0|Fast moving story but not very real. The good guys seldom win in cook county. Enjoyed it though as I always enjoy grisham.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I find the information provided to be almost overwhelming. It gives me understanding and an amount of power for health.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I love this movie and so glad I own it.  They have on amazon alot of movies you cannot get anywhere else....its a thumbs up for me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Maybe his best and most clever; twists and turns requiring the reader to accept the improbable as probable.  Nonetheless it held my attention start to finish even though the finale seemed a little mushy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|At times funny, always deeply moving, this book is a tour de force. perhaps not quite as original and &#34;different&#34; as &#34;Looking for Alaska&#34; but still deserving of all the accolades.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Not as good as most of the others she has written. I like the story but it dragged in the beginning. I am tired of Marino and his character.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Liked the look and the price!  Fits perfectly, light, easy to carry, good protection for the Kindle Firde.  Have protection for all my electronic devices, this is no exception.
B002N8TJ18|5.0|I bought it mostly for &#34;Only Time&#34;. The others are also well done, but it is the signature song. Very good.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Great Childrens Movie. My kids saw it twice in the theater and couldnt wait to get it home. The price that I purchased it for was unbelievable.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|if  you love the black keys, you definitely wont be disappointed. A must have. Black Submarines is a revelation. buy it!
B0007LCNKC|4.0|Before ordering this version, know that there's also a 180g version on green vinyl. Not to say this version isn't good... but it's not 180g or colored. My version from Amazon pops more than it should during Val Jester and Secret Meeting has a slight skip. Neither of which I've been able to fix. Still it's a great album !
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great read. Thank you Chris for everything. You're a true American Hero. It's too bad that not a lot of people know it. RIP

B006BXTOFC|5.0|The Black Keys are incredible!  If you haven't bought this album yet, just do it.  And how can you beat a $3 album!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I think that this book is better written, better context, better alternative...just the characters are not as loveable, as those in Fifty Shades of Gray. Absolutely love this book.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|if you like mission impossible movies you should like this one. The character Benji is funny. Lots of action here
B00846F1YW|3.0|Nice storyline but graphics can be improved. Also in hiddenn object gAmes some of the items being searched hides behind the top bar and can't be searched wiyhout using hint and even after using hint it is very difficult to click on them if playing with finger instead of stylus.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED ON HOW MUCH MY FAMILY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. THE CRITICS REVIEW WAS LESS THEN STELLAR, SO MY EXPECTATIONS WERE KIND OF LOW. RIGHT FROM THE START, THIS MOVIE HAD OUR ATTENTION; I FOUND IT TO BE QUITE HUMOROUS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL AGE GROUPS
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I was told about this series and Amazon was the only place I found the Season Opener...I am so hooked on this show now, it is an excellent show with great story lines. It alone is worth joining Prime...
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Schrade SCHF9 Extreme Survival Knife with Fixed 1095 High Carbon Steel Blade and Black Kraton Handle and Sheath is very heavy well made knife at a great price point. It has a very thick blade, full tang and very grippy handle. When I showed the knife to friends they love the feel of the grip. Sheath, well like most production sheaths, they fall short. Does it hold the knife? Yes. I don't buy knives for the sheaths.
B00846REIS|5.0|A great alternative to Fifty Shades of Gray. Better writing, Easier to read..the characters however are not as easy to love as those in Fifty Shades, but are loveable. Do love the book and look foreward to the series wrapping up!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Love it very much, we look forward to seeing everynight. Can't wait for to see the next season. would recommend to others.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great series...all i can say its a must see...and you should definitly watch them all from the begining....the storyline is what great about this series....and the charcaters are very believable...i love the series....
B007MNV5WU|3.0|My younger children love to play some of the games to include this one.  Unfortunately, the &#34;extra content&#34; that can be purchased is not able to be disabled or changed from one touch ordering.  So, my 4 year old just bought 70 &#34;pig puffers @ $5.00.  Lucky for me it was not one of the more expensive options...  If it happens again the game is gone...  Was a big turn off for me.  It is a nice distraction for them on road trips etc.  Now I have to monitor their play. Not for the whole family.  Why cannot there be some parental locks?
B001NHNG64|5.0|2nd book and you can see Lee Child is starting to &#34;flesh&#34; out Jack Reacher.  The first book really is good,  But this book has hooked be on Lee Child.

B003UBTX72|3.0|The book is a bit long and covers alot of ground but Mr. Richards is intellegent and tells a good story.
B005JE7XW0|5.0|I like the funny way this movie was made.  I thought it was going to be another lame &#34;hot girl gets slaughtered first movie&#34; but it was a very good surprise.
B000OJFV4C|1.0|I was expecting a historical dramatic series, but this was more about a romp in bed than anything else. It just wasn't what we were looking for.
B009K0OL06|5.0|although you may expect that &#34;second seasons&#34; are not at the same level of &#34;first seasons&#34;, this time revenge second season (the first 2 episodes) over passed the expectation! always able to surprise you! you never get bored!
B00846F1YW|5.0|Nice to get a free app hidden object game that lets you play more than a  couple of levels. Reasonable story line, good graphics. Don't care for the fact that every time you're zoomed in &amp; place your finger on the screen to move around it treats it as as incorrect search hit. But overall it's a good game from a reliable developer.
B0013O123Q|1.0|The movie made an impression like it had no director at all, and they had a drunken cameraman. I'd sooner watch porn than this completely screwed up crap.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|The Downton storyline is addictively great, of course, but as a Prime member who was sold on &#34;free streaming,&#34; I was bummed to pay for the episode (but I also realize it is ridiculously popular and fairly new). I was happy until the the following night when my roommate streamed the same episode for FREE via pbs.org and it went on an hour longer than this one! I had paid to watch what was really only half the real episode. WTH?
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Rothfuss's first work is impressive in many ways and frustrating at the same time.  Like many modern fantasy writers these days he suffers from overblown ideas and an inability to control the creative instinct.  In this book the problem is illustrated by a story that takes forever to actually begin.  After the first two hundred pages the story starts to pick up and the book starts to be something special.  In the end the audience is left with a story that is quite good, but is also an examination on all stories including itself.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|not much else to say it is an amazing game good graphics good layout the save me is a nice touch
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Bought the kindle for kids to do school work on, but they always end up on temple run 1 and now 2. Great games.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Get it. It is awesome it is so easy but Shawn you get to the train it is hard because it took me about 5 times just to get it right
B004T4LUPW|5.0|AAA+++ The CalenGoo is very handy on the Tablet, it syncs with the other calendars (PC and the other Tablets). This way no matter where we look the information is there.
0061992860|5.0|This book is really tiny, fits in a little pocket of your bag. Very well thought out info and diagrams. Hope I don't have to use it, but glad I have it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love playing Jewels Star! Its like exercise for your brain! It's challenging and just plain fun! I highly recommend!
B00338QENI|5.0|What an interesting read. You don't realize how much science and life has changed for most of us until you read things like this.
B00AP9RQE4|3.0|I like more military type action in my books then this one offers.  I'll probably not read the other ones in the Saga.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|AAA+++ The Ice Age Village does everything the add said and it is Fun to play! I really like the graphic on the screen.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Movie is perfect for all ages. Adam Sandler & the cast was great. Several times it had us all laughing.
B0036UMM84|5.0|Anything that Barbra sings in is going to be decent but this movie is one of her best in my opinion
B004J4WKDI|4.0|An interesting book, didn't really turn out the way I thought it might, but sometimes that's what makes it interesting. Worth the read.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|This is a very sturdy knife with a sharp edge. The fit and finish are what you would expect for $43.  The handle is a bit large, but fits in my average size hand.  The handle is tuxtured which gives you a solid sense of control, even in a wet situation. The sheath is well design and built.  For the price I paid, you can't go wrong adding this knife to your collection.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I give this book 5 stars because i can understand everything perfectly. If your out there James Dashner i love all your books and if you read the hunger games i think your books are better than that:):):):):)
B000QFW7UA|5.0|-- GET PRIME -- well worth it.<br /><br />ok.  The Goonies .... its an American Classic!  The 25th Anniversary Edition comes with many cool extras and the board game!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I'm usually not into folk music, but Mumford and Sons nails it.  I couldn't wait to hear their music on the radio and it always made me so happy.  They are amazing performers and the lead singer is hot too.  Great funky folk music.  It makes me happy.  The entire album is the way to go.  You'll grow to love them even more.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Fantasic story with great characters and a very emotional ending. It was a lot more than I had expected. What I had expected was a fun time travel movie with cool action, which it was, but it was also far and beyond that. One of the best sci-fi movies of the decade.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love all of Nicholas sparks books, but this one is one of my favorites!(: he is a great writer
B003O86FMW|5.0|WTF i hate when authors stop in the middle of the best part but one word. Best book ever WOW
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am so happy I finally took the time to read this extraordinary story. It made me examine my own being and the importance of the simple joys of life.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|So much talent.  So much to love.  I was a walking musical for a month after I bought this.  I literally could not stop singing the music.  All the songs are amazing.  This album lets you get to know the songs you love from les mis so much better.  You will love them even more if you own this album.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Fantastic set. Very fun to build. Nice details, like blasting your way out of the detention center and into the trash compactor.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|THIS BOOK IS TRULY AMAZING !!! It took me a little less than a full 24 hours to finish . I cried at the end, I can't wait to read the following books :D!!!!
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|Highly enjoyable soundtrack, I'm very happy with this purchase.  I read the reviews and was worried, but to me it sounds like the movie.  Maybe I'm just not musically sophisticated enough to know the difference, but it sounds good to me.  My kids LOVE it too.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Good game to pass hours of boredom. Great for increasing reaction<br />time. Recommended by a friend and would also recommend it to others.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Dialogue was great, special effects were great, chemistry among the actors fantastic.  I've seen this 3 times now and would watch it again (and again).
B0019I6WDG|5.0|This movie was very well made. Funny, not cookie cutter. Very realistic situation, and emotions. My teen daughter saw it and thought it was fantastic
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app I have it on my ipod and my kindle fire hd. If you have the kindle fire hd dont think agian about buying this app.<br /><br />BUY THIS APP ITS EPIC!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Yes, this is a free game. Yes it is like temple run, but it is so much better. Daily games, small side missions, just cute things. Very undervalued!
0060589469|2.0|The narrative is basically a vehicle for the author's cracker barrel philosophy. Okay, he has some serious philosophical ideas waiting on the back-burner but they never really make it to the front burner. If you regard Alan Watts, Ayn Rand, and Khalil Gibran as great thinkers, you will find their equal in Pirsig. What I found most interesting about the book is that it reminded me of a person I knew. This person had gone to Saint John's College in Maryland where everyone has to read the Great Books. He claimed to have the highest IQ since Aristotle (it would have been higher but for a childhood illness.) The narrator of Zen reminded me of him - I started to sniff the deja vu around page 35. 'Phaedrus,' as the narrator calls himself, after a character in Plato's eponymous dialogue, is of course Pirsig, a man of towering genius and a veteran of the Great Books Program at Univ. of Chicago (which spawned the program at St John's). Phaedrus saw his fabulous intellect decimated by psychiatric drugs, but he is going to share his wisdom with you one way or another. His wisdom turns out to be an extended meditation on Plato and the notion of Quality, which he relates to such sixties-ish themes as Zen and riding a motorcycle in search of America. Along the way he serves up quotable sound bites like 'the motorcycle you are working on is yourself.' Heavy, man. This book is prized because the 'action' consists in the progress of the author's thoughts, but I found both the journey and the destination unexciting. If you are in search of illumination of the human condition, I suggest as an alternative reading a few of the Great Books, such as Plato himself, Dostoevsky or Shakespeare.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I watched it because I didn't want anything deep or thought provoking and it turned out to be pretty entertaining.  My reluctance was in the fact that I don't like Adam Sandler but in animation he's okay.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app! Loads of fun for kids and adults! Realistic and entertaining!I hacker this on my illness and so happy it is now available for kindle.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|Um the game itself is ok but.... When i play online its not giving me xp or cash.<br /><br />GAMELOFT PLEASE FIX THIS PLEASE!!!!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Ms. Strayed tells about her experience hiking the pacific crest trail. She has a clear strong authorial voice. I enjoyed the way she wove her personal history into the hiking narrative.  Given the popularity of the book, I expected more insight and less narcissism but perhaps that was a reflection of her age at the time (26). The story rarely faltered and was surprisingly suspenseful. Four stars from me.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|After being recommended to me by a friend I sat down to watch the first episode, but quickly got sucked into this world. The fantastical elements are well balanced by the &#34;science&#34; of it. Walter is a genius, and always manages to make me laugh.
B009VB97EY|3.0|If the only reason you're watching this is because of Channing Tatum and his bod....then go for it.  Don't expect much else.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|This series keeps getting better and better and better...Matt Smith is an EXCELLENT Doctor for the 50th anniversary of Dr. Who
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this book was great and can't wait to read the second one, I hope it's as good as this one.
B004QSQML8|5.0|I grew up with this movie and have seen it countless times. took forever to come to blue ray and finally its here!!<br />very good image considering how old it is, conversion to blue ray went really good.good extras too.  If your a fan, this is the one to have.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love this cd and all the songs on it except for one track that I'm not crazy about. So much better than getting a cd in which the hit songs are the only ones that are good.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Great idea for a book. It had some flaws, but neither me nor my wife couldn't stop reading it. Highly recommended.
B0072HXVRS|5.0|Beautiful series of toys. They were a big hit with my six year old. Nice quality very lifelike and detailed.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I love the Black Keys, have for a while.  People looked at me crazy when I told them this was my new favorite band in 2008.  This is their best collection of work since Attack & Release, maybe their best yet.  Three of the first four tracks - 'Lonely Boy', 'Gold On The Ceiling', and 'Little Black Submarines' - all outstanding, all different enough to keep the listener interested (and dancing, usually).  And unlike a typical album, this is not where things fall off, rather this is where things get going!  The album is not dead!  The Black Keys will make sure of it!
1401235417|5.0|What can be said that hasn't already been said? Scott Snyder is a certifiable genius (and madman?) when it comes to crafting a good story.<br />The way he's turning out Batman stories and making them exciting, he could be labeled as the next Denny O'Neil.<br />Snyder's take on Batman is fresh, yet familiar. He really gets inside Bruce Wayne's head and gives us a side of the Bat Family we haven't seen...at least, not for a long time. He really tinkers with the idea that Batman always has a plan and delves deep into the symbolism of urban myths.<br />Turning the tables on Batman the way he does is pure genius. The people of Gotham used to see Batman as the urban myth and now Batman is being stalked by something he always thought was a myth.<br />The Court of Owls is something that just seems like an obvious addition to the Batman story and it's amazing nobody thought to do this before. What makes them better is how well developed they and their Talons are throughout. It's difficult to add new villains to such well established rogues galleries, but Snyder has given us a new organization that should definitely pop up every now and again.<br />Instant classic? I'm going to say yes!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book I could not put down  :)  The story line was excellent, probably one of the best romance books ever.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best zomby show i have ever see.  The character are beliveabule.<br />The zomby move slow, they do not run.  Bye
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Again, the movie itself was excellent. I won't, however, be renting through Amazon again.  If I'm to pay 6 bucks for an online rental, I expect 1080p.  I know it when I see it.  This was not 'it'.
1449433251|5.0|I love love love this book!! It made me cry to read it and remember my childhood, an incredible memento!!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|You can always depend on N.Sparks.  This was a fairly predictable story, but I enjoyed reading it.  Wonder if the movie will be as good?
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked it and it wasn't a rip off no glitches or anything it works perfectly fine now just read the last book
B003F3FJQO|5.0|What did I just read?!?! Woah! Major cliffhanger, poor tom!!! Moving on to book 3... please let this next book have a happy ending
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 10 year old says it's one of the best games he's ever played, but he wishes he could have the mods on it.  Otherwise, he says it's a really great game--he's addicted!  Good thing Kindle Free Time lets me set the time limits for him!
B0098VXE50|5.0|5 out of 5 stars. So much better than I expected! Charlize Theron was flawless as the Evil Queen & Kristin Stewart was actually pretty good. Chris Hemsworth is gorgeous!!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone that watches bones on television and likes it. A shame the way a girl can be transformed into a whore.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love this app because you get two fling around all the little birdies!!! My little cousin loves to watch me play on Angry Birds. Epic classic!!!<br /> Hope you love my review!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|What I have read is good so far, kind of slow to start.  I know it will get better though from the many friends that have read it.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Plenty of good songs besides the ones you hear on the radio.  Very mellow and consistent melody.  Priced well.  Good value for $4.
B00979CS50|4.0|\\"Like Young's \\"Le Noise\\", how can a band of men this old rock so hard? Rolling Stones, take note...two songs are 16 minutes long and one is 27 minutes long, yet they don't drag...this album is like a hard-rock trance/jam. After all these years, Neil Young and Crazy Horse still surprise...\\"[[ASIN:B00979CS50 Psychedelic Pill]]
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is beyond addictive, exhilarating and simply awesome!! I can't get enough! Every episode doesn't let down; it delivers the suspense, action, blood and gore, and the common brotherhood amongst the characters. With each new airing, there is yet another surprise waiting in the shadows!! I highly recommend this series to those who aren't easily disgusted by rotting flesh and oozing guts!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever never stop playing day or night only when decide is really challenging or really bad Whelan tierd
B004HD61KE|4.0|enjoyed the story and learned something .  Tied a bunch of things together that I never would have dreamed of. I will read more by James Rollins!
B007TK77QE|3.0|Lets just say it is not what I was expecting!  I suppose we have been spoilt with the fantastic writing in the Harry Potter novels, however I did not really enjoy this book but it was okay.  When I got to the end of the book I felt that it ended rather abruptly and left me wondering!!!!<br /><br />Sorry J.K. Rowling but I don't think this type of writing is you :0(
B005SAJJHM|5.0|This is my favorite episode.  I don't care for the &#34;getting high&#34; 1/2 of the episode; but, Sheldon with Penny at the ER can make me laugh until I cry.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was  awsome it was funny and  I can't w a  it until the next one great well thought out on Jeff's part
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Fantastic game with stunning graphics. Flawless controls. More thanworth the price. Would happily buy additional levels or more games from developets.
B00785P2QC|5.0|good fun keeps you busy always something to do. doesn't take money or anything of that nature. might at well give it a try
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love it. its great. its a bit creepy....but i like it. great. its competitive, super fun and time consuming...
B009FZFONO|5.0|I absolutely love this show. This HD version is incredible. If you love action and horror, then you should give this show a shot. But make sure to start on season 1 ;)
B0053JJLLC|5.0|I loved this book! It was a little slow at parts, but did not disappoint! I would recommend  reading this. It's worth it.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|The story line goes solid with well built characters around a build up to an event. Yet I can't put aside the feeling of reading a script to a movie rather than a book. First of all names were very difficult to follow since I think we are not used to the Swedish culture but that is our fault, but the explicit details of how to go from where to there and the coffee and the street all felt out of context and just more words to fell a book.  I didn't need to know all f those details and I was more interested in words invested in the emotional states of the characters rather than how they got to that street.
B005LAII80|5.0|They may not of had the budget of films like hobbit or avengers but this film has possibly the best use of 3d in a film to date!! karl urban was dredd!!! this movie is as close to dredds persona as you can get , dont compare it to that s*** fest that stallone put out......a musthave for all 3dtv owners
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love the cube attack portion. You really have to go fast, but it is fun, and wakes you up quickly. This is a good game.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|This movie is awesome.  It's a great sequel to the original and keeps you in suspense.  Had me in tears at one point.
B002GJI8PM|5.0|I'm not very good at writing reviews and I don't know as much about music as many of the other people who have already reviewed this album, but I just wanted to say how very much I enjoy listening to this. I do love soundtracks and this is one of the most gripping, haunting, and beautiful I've ever heard.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is very very very VERY good I luv it to pass the timed and just for lots of fun
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This classic book is an amazing book to read with your family, which is exactly what I did. You will enjoy this free book.
B000F8O35U|4.0|Doesn't everyone love The Little Mermaid?  My old VHS copy is still in the VCR being held captive.  Needed to replace the movie for my college age daughter because she loved it so as a child!
B008KYOCA2|1.0|Jorge calender sucks because I don't even use it, it just totally isn't helpful because all it does is take up space on my Carousel
B009FZHYKU|1.0|After purchasing this video, it would not play. I have not had any issues in the past. Wish I could get a refund since I never got to watch it.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I played this game quite a bit but I will never play this game or anything by Kiloo games ever again. I say this because it takes a lot to upgrade the boosts and get your bonus multiplier to x30. However, that means nothing to Kiloo games as my progress has been completely wiped out for no good reason. Also, many times I have encountered some kind of glitch that wouldn't let me complete the daily challenge.<br /><br />No one wants to start over after months of progress.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Love the movie. I am always a fan of the most recent Marvel movies, I would definitely recommend it to someone else.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Made this purchase as a gift for my child.  Love this movie, enjoy watching it over and over.  So intriguing.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Book sucked. It was terrible amazins service was great. Downloaded super quick. Dont buy the book but if u must buy from amazon.
B00846F1YW|5.0|clean play through game.  excellent graphics with nothing hidden behind edges.  good story line and characters.  puzzles good but not frustratingly difficult.  hint works well and items pick up well.  did not have to tap the heck out of the tablet!  a pleasure to play if you like hidden object puzzles.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I can't even recall how I stumbled across this release, but I'm glad I did. It is a rock/pop/electronic feast for the ears. I'd describe them as The Killers with the quirky songwriting of OK GO or The Faint. I'm usually into heavier music, but if something is inspired and catchy enough I am open to enjoying it. That is the case with this - hopefully more good music is still to come. Great and unique vocals throughout. This is yet another CD that I find so memorable that I can't believe they don't get some more mainstream airplay/recognition.<br /><br />I could do without the two \\"throwaway\\" tracks (Some Sort of Creature and My Nightmare's Dream) but I just skip them.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|This script of this movie had some flashes of comedic brilliance but it was almost overshadowed by the &#34;necessary&#34; adolescent crassness required to make money these days, especially from the teen crowd.  That being said the cast was more than competent, the numbers mostly entertaining and overall ok for the 16+ target audience.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Its not Opera, its not Arias, its easy listening, thats the point!<br />As a matter of fact it is very easy listening and easy to love! I happen to be a fan of Brazilian Jazz and Bossa Nova and I am delighted he and David Foster decided to do 4 cuts<br />of Bossa Nova, they did a great job. It is smooth and jazzy with Andrea's fluid Italian voice, I think it works really well and the duets with J.Lo and Nelly Furtado are good, but overall I think the CD<br />is produced and arranged beautifully and David Foster,there is no one better.Overall I think its a fantastic CD, up there with \\"Amore\\" and my all time favorite \\"Under The Desert Sky\\" Live in Las Vegas!<br />If your a big Fan, Andrea Does Not Disappoint!!
1595827684|5.0|Every where else in store is $60, here it was $25 plus shipping. That in itself makes it worth it... But! I heard many bad reviews about the book. I then got the book, and if you liked mass effect, you will love this book, especially if you love concept art. Great pictures, and great written detail on the images. Amazing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|enjoyed reading this book excited to see movie. Hope it is as good as the book!!! Would recommend this read,
B00846F1YW|1.0|Good luck getting past level 1-2. They hide the final object behind the clues menu. I'll say it again...stupid. And again...stupid.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I actually purchased this item for my young great nieces, as I first viewed and found I truly loved it in 1996 and thought, it was so heart warming and smart.  Many times, there may be parts/portions of a movie, which do not belong - {too mature for the young} but this particular movie is perfect.<br /><br />The quick delivery is also a plus, for I will be giving it to them for Valentines' Day this year, I gave the book to each of them, but, they will be very suprise to have the movie as well.
B004HD61KE|5.0|It has plenty of excitement to keep you on the edge of your seat through the whole book, and more.
1449305172|5.0|WOW.. Amazing Book.. This book can take any buisness and transform it with a clear, simple and thoughtless PROFITable Model of Impacting the world.  Wow!!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Since &#34;Castle&#34; is one of my favourite TV shows, I wanted to read it.  A good read but not enough depth to make it a great read.
B007XHWROK|5.0|I \\"Believe\\" that our young daughter is crazy for Justin Bieber!  We gave this to her for Christmas and she still listens to it often.  The CD comes with a small poster and she has it taped up on her bedroom wall. It's too funny!
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Good action movie and worth watching. They took their time between movies to get a good script, plot and cast. It's better than some previous movies in the series. Jeremy Renner had a better performance than Tom Cruise.
0634060384|5.0|The standard must-have collection for any budding jazz player. Get in it, learn a few tunes, transpose, be a better musician.
0425263916|3.0|It arrived fast.  This was recommened by a friend of mine.  She thought it was better than 50 Shades but I found it more of a rip off and didn't think it was written nearly as well.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It has many levels, I felt at times as thoe I was standing there watching in on them! I CAN'T WAIT FOR BOOK 4 to come out
B00005O3VD|1.0|I ordered Funny Girl (my favorite musical, of course) and was very excited upon its arrival this Valentine's Day. I planned on watching it on my vacation but when I opened the packaging, it showed that I, in fact, had received Funny Lady. Honestly, who likes Funny Lady?<br />Not cool.
B003U9TDII|5.0|Hans Zimmer does it again. Another well thought out, intimately and intricately connected soundtrack for this thought-provoking film.<br /><br />I'm a music therapist, and we have a special chair called a Somatron that vibrates in multiple sections with bass tones, and plays music right around the head, while the body is reclined. When testing out a new one, I decided to play &#34;Time&#34; off of this soundtrack. It was basically a religious experience.<br /><br />Last anecdote: I was playing piano for a funeral a few weeks ago, and I didn't have enough music to fill the time before the ceremony started, so I started improvising. I decided to play (an interpretation of the four chords from) &#34;Time&#34; as it is so melancholily beautiful.
B004I744AS|5.0|by far the most user-friendly nonlinear dictionary! and what fun...hangman? genius! I use the medical dictionary frequently. thank you for making this helpful website available.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I found it worked just like a kindle and I did not have to buy another piece of equipment.  It is also easy to use.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|This is a good movie even if you are not a football fan.<br />Worth the price since I streamed it and didn't have to get in my car to pick it up or return it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|If you enjoyed Kate Morton's other books, you'll enjoy this one too.<br />There are lots of twists in this story.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Great read.  Love Ken Follett.  The characters come alive and you can actually picture how people lived during that period.  If you like history this is a wonderful read.  If you can, you need to read The Pillars of the Earth to get the whole story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|although they are all captivating, i read all three within just a few days.  i had heard of it, and decided to read it, but did not know the subject matter until i got into it.  it didnt matter, i was already into it...
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I'm so glad I have the second and third book ready!<br />I'd recommend to Hunger Games fans
B0094BB4TW|4.0|There are still some things this apps doesn't do that FB does at the webpage level.  I can't recall what exactly those things are at the moment but I remember thinking that while using the app.  Overall, I like it.  It does the basics at least and that's good enough for me.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a fascinating and very detailed biography.  It gives the reader an understanding of why President Lincoln was such a great President and such a great man.  I have read at least 6 very good biographies of different Presidents and none of them were better than Team of Rivals. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about history, enjoys reading presidential biographies or just wants read a very interesting story about a great President.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Excellent film,  showing the true story of a very humble, very talented man,  who did not even know how many loved his music in AFrica

B004DLPXAO|5.0|This book was not what I expected it was suspenceful , erotic and makes you wonder about things that you would not usually think about . Whether you' re single or not it'.ll have you fantasizing all night.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I love this app. Super useful, works really fast, does what it says. You need a reasonably good wifi connection for it to work (didn't work on a greyhound bus), but besides that, really a cool, useful app.
B003K16PFU|4.0|It's hard to tell what sort of novel this is, but don't let this hinder you from reading this because it has the potential to be an autobiography. This novel is fantastic. Once you get over the constant use of acronyms, this will be the best historical novel you'll read. Not to mention, one of the most accurate considering Orwell really fought in the war.
B004BSFC46|1.0|This is the quietest rattle, it makes almost no noise.  I would not recommend you buy it unless you are looking for decoration only for a child to look at.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|it is one of the better bingo games that I have like it a lot. But would like to see my changes for powerups and bingos have lots of rooms to play in.
B0024Y9EYS|2.0|I had seen a few of the Terminator TV shows over the years but this was my first chance to watch them from the beginning of the series.  The pilot show was good but it was downhill from there.  It's like all the dumb shows, like &#34;24&#34; where the blond screws up every key moment and the show drags on for another week.  I blame the writers and directors, not the actors.  I will not watch another episode since Episode #2 killed it for me.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Simply LOVE Angry Birds Rio much better than ALL the other one's I've played so far. Much more exciting.  Thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really addicting. I just don't know the world high score. Can some one tell me? Overall I like the game and prefer it for all ages.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|It was a different kind of SyFi read.  He used a lot of math and computing language to show how he was coping with being on Mars and how he was surviving.  But it worked and was a very enjoyable book.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I wanted a case that perfectly fit my Kindle Fire and this is the only one that does. I also like the feature which allows me to read hands-free. It's light enough and protects my Kindle.
B0082LUEW8|5.0|For fans of Pantera and Mudvayne, Hellyeah brings a little bit of both of their styles (Vinnie Paul of Pantera and Cud of Mudvayne). Their sound is awesome. I love that I can still listen to Vinnie's drumming and Cud's singing with this band since their former bands were two of my favorites. This album rocks from start to finish. I love when I can put on a cd and let it play all the way through without skipping any tracks.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This movie adds a lot more comedy than the other Mission Impossible movies. It's lighthearted tone allows you to enjoy the movie a little more. The others in the series are so far fetched, it's hard to believe any of it. The laughs in this one distract from how unrealistic it all is. I thought it helped the flow and added more depth.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|I should start this review by disclaiming a remarkable fact: I purchased the complete series of Star Trek Enterprise a few years back without ever having watched a single episode of the show during its broadcast run.  I say this not because I seek your respect, admiration or pity (though were you to insist on either of the first two, I suppose I wouldn't complain) but rather to illustrate a simple point:  When it comes to sci-fi entertainment, the Trek legacy has some pretty big shoes to fill as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />So the big question you're probably asking yourself is whether or not I feel it was money well spent and I'll be glad to divulge such information but before doing so, let's take a moment to break down the hard facts of the show and its DVD release so as to further determine whether or not this is the set for you, shall we?<br /><br />Set in the nearby regions of the Milky Way galaxy, during roughly the 2150s (ten years before the United Federation of Planets would be formed), the show follows the adventures of humanity's very first warp 5 capable starship: Enterprise.<br /><br />According to the mythos, at warp 2, only a handful of inhabited planets were within a year's travel from Earth.  But at warp 5, that number increased to ten thousand planets and thus it is the appointed task of Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) & crew to visit as many of these worlds as possible.<br /><br />The show debuted September 26 2001 on UPN and ran for 98-episodes spanning a total of 4-seasons (ending on May 13, 2005).  Low ratings are credited for its demise and unfortunately the dubious distinction of being the first Star Trek series since the original to have been cancelled by its network rather than finished by producers.  It's also the bookend of an amazing run of Trek TV: The last series in an 18-year run of back-to-back new Star Trek shows beginning with Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1987.<br /><br />That said, I can truly state that I went into the program with absolutely no expectations or predeterminations save for those established during previous Trek incarnations (most notably Next Generation and Deep Space 9).  Initially I was a bit let down with the Enterprise formula.  The first season, at least in my opinion, struggled to find itself.  The cast didn't seem overly believable, the sets were deficient in imagination and perhaps most of all, the prose simply lacked that slightly mind-bending flow of believability that has always been a staple of the Star Trek experience to me.<br /><br />Granted, I realize that this particular point in the mythos' timeline is supposed to be laced with claustrophobia and marvel considering it represents humanity's first foray into the galactic fold; the episodes themselves were a bit meandering to me with emphasis on action and quick resolve over the technologically brilliant conclusions to seemingly unsolvable dilemmas I'd come to cherish in past Trek efforts.<br /><br />I made it through the fairly lackluster first season and the initial half of the second, starting to assume this would be the formula for the entire series only to be pleasantly surprised somewhere around the halfway point of the second season.  Suddenly it was as if the cast had fallen into rhythm with both the characters they portrayed and interaction with one another.  Perhaps even more importantly, however, was the writing seemed to have taken a huge step forward as well.<br /><br />Episodes became far less reliant upon the gimmick of making the viewer privy to events of historical importance (even those that came off feeling like cheap reenactments) and instead simply dropped the cast of characters into some interesting scenarios where their sharp wits and collaboration became crucial for survival.  It didn't hurt that technological explanations and believable science became cornerstones of the formula as well.<br /><br />By the time the second season concluded, I was quite excited about starting out the third in the hopes of it continuing on with its newfound rhythm.  The third season, however, made another radical departure to the recipe, this time becoming a single episode that happens to take an entire season to develop.  While this was surely a risky move as far as syndication opportunities are concerned, viewers of the DVDs do get to follow along on a very solid dilemma with high stakes (earth being the target) and a whole bunch of exotic locales, species, alliances and betrayals to keep things interesting.<br /><br />Once again however I fear the tendency of the show's habit of going one step forward for two steps back rears its head.  The third season thread is resolved, well that's not technically correct, ends on a cliffhanger that carries into the fourth (and final) season.<br /><br /> Here we kick things off with an alternate universe scenario that, aside from learning an entire episode was merely a dream, ranks up there as one of my lesser-appreciated cop outs in fiction.  This rather odd thread involving World War II era earth carries through for a couple of episodes, returns so stand-alone episode format then returns with but another alternate universe crescendo multi-parter.  This time the crew of Enterprise in an alternate dimension, one where violence and ruthlessness reign supreme, happen upon Kirk's Enterprise from the original series (complete with wonky sound effects and 60s-style uniforms) and intend to use the vastly superior tech to overthrow their totalitarian empire.  Many of the moments of this particular thread come off as forcefully comedic and, I suspect, not nearly as polished a finished product as it must have seemed on paper.<br /><br />Then, just when things are at their proverbial darkest hour, the 4th season concludes with an interesting thread centered on human-supremacy groups resorting to terrorist actions to preserve the human-way of life on earth during impending alien cohabitation.  I won't give away any spoilers, but let me just say that the final episode of the show takes a clever, fairly brilliant, approach to sending off the crew of Enterprise as only a cast & crew aware that the show has reached its conclusion can.<br /><br />I suppose if my ramblings and summaries thus far need have amounted to anything, I would hope they resemble a reflection to the fact that the show is a bit inconsistent at best.  There are moments sprinkled about its 4-season run that truly hark back to the finer moments of Star Trek's fabled history but unlike say Next Generation, consistent brilliance is simply not a given.  However, when Enterprise does hit its marks, and rest assured- it does, it's right up there with the quality and depth of storytelling Trekkers have come to expect from the franchise.<br /><br />In closing, to those who have endured my rather lengthy critique wondering whether this box set is worth their time and money, I have to say that I did find myself watching the entire program successively in about a year's time including all of the commentary and bonus materials.  In even its darkest moments, Star Trek is still superior to just about 99% of all science fiction out there and this show does continue on in that tradition.  Though my words may have come off as harsh at times, please do keep in mind that many of the flaws and shortcomings mentioned manifest when compared to the impeccable past Trek incarnations first and foremost.  When judged on their own accord (especially against what passes for science fiction television of late), nearly everything I mentioned can be overlooked!<br /><br />I am glad to have the most recent Trek incarnation taking its rightful place on the entertainment center shelf next to Voyager before it and am hoping, for better or worse, that the powers-that-be get to work on its successor.

B0080K3G4O|4.0|Really well researched and informative.  Humorous at times. Definitely worth reading if self-help gurus turn you off! His research led me to pursue more readings.
B00AIA89HS|5.0|I have been a Hatebreed fan for a long time (since Satisfaction Is The Death of Desire). While I think they have evolved some throughtout the years, they still have that unique hardcore sound that I love from them. From Jamey's in your face vocals to the crunchy guitar riffs and the kick butt drumming, this album does not dissapoint. Another album that I can put on and let play though all the way.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The entire series is well written, believable, and well acted.  I can't wait to watch the entire series and move on to season 3!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This does what I want it to do quickly and easily.  What's the temperature and is it going to rain tomorrow.
0060558121|2.0|Perhaps it was my mindset going in, but I simply could not get into this book. To me, Shadow (the protagonist) was moved through the story in a completely inorganic way. A simple example, but one that I feel illustrates my point (while keeping spoiler-free): Shadow, upon being released from prison, never has to check with a parole officer, nor has any issue travelling great distances under certain employ without a \\"I could go right back to prison if I actually don't check in with my parole officer\\".<br />I'm certain you can argue that such trivialities were glossed over to cover the greater story, and I'm certainly not the reader who needs every individual action covered in the page... but I was actually taken out of the story by the inconsistent-with-typical-behavior actions performed by various characters and how that drove the story. Perhaps more accurately, I came away with the feeling that the characters - and not me, as the reader - was being pulled through the narrative as if Gaiman had two tangential thoughts (the idea for the story, and an ending) and spent the pages in between herding his characters to the intersection.<br /><br />Again, perhaps I went in askew. And in truth, I did not finish the book (Shadow is currently in the woods after receiving additional instructions - again, as spoiler free as possible), so I will make sure I return with a complete review.

1451696205|5.0|Although this is technically classified as a young adult book, I would recommend it to any adult. I originally picked up the book after seeing the preview in theaters for the movie and it was stunning. The way Chobsky captures the lives of young people is incredible.

B000ID37KO|5.0|I grew up watching these types of movies. The Birds is a great &#34;scary&#34; movie for any occasion, it is just fun to watch.
B0039NCJFO|4.0|No one ever said being a teenager is easy.  Everyone in this movie finds that out in his or her own way.  What starts out as a pact to have sex for the first time before prom turns into an honest examination of the true importance of sex, relationships, and, unexpectedly, even love.  Plenty of awkwardness and laughs, too!
0061766089|5.0|For me, This is the second design and innovation book I have read for one of my business courses. Being a mechanical engineer, a lot of my experiences relate to systematic problem solving. In most cases, a top down approach is used for troubleshooting a system. Design thinking truly allows us to think in new ways and develop unique solutions to problems. I found this book extremely helpful, as it showed me how to step back from my projects and look at the purpose in a new light.
0395389496|5.0|In very good shape as described, & my son loves it! Yeah for the charity selling donated used books to raise funds.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|A great story line if a bit to perfect and happening too fast to be believable. A hero that makes no mistakes does not lend himself to a real life vision. Add in too many misspellings and wrong words and this book only gets a 4 star rating from me at this Time.
B0045HCJ94|5.0|An apr&egrave;s-dinner party turns downright ugly.  How else can I describe &#34;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&#34;  A hen-pecked man stays married to his vulgar wife simply to maintain his position, and she stays with her because she knows she can't do any better.  When they invite a young couple to their house, long pent-up hostilities erupt in an uncontrollable volly of insults and abuse, and absolutely no one is safe.  Pay close attention to the end.  The explanation for everything that happens passes almost in the blink of an eye, but it explains so much.  And another day dawns, and everything is as it should be...
B009AMANBA|5.0|After seeing this masterwork by Spielberg, and seeing Daniel Day-Lewis'performance-for which he will almost certainly win the Oscar in a couple weeks and which is already becoming legendary-I almost feel sad for any future actors who try to take on the role of the 16th President. Simply put, Daniel Day-Lewis IS Abraham Lincoln now and for all time. He incarnates the Civil War President in this movie in a manner that at times almost gave me the chills. There is one particular scene where he is visiting a battlefield hospital and begins to engage wounded Union soldiers by asking them to give their names first. I had to remind myself that I was watching an actor portray a President who has been dead for nearly 150 years.<br /><br />Day-Lewis and Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln broke my heart. In fact everyone from Day-Lewis on down is simply first-rate.<br /><br />There are no assassination scenes(there is a brief deathbed scene) and the name John Wilkes Booth is never even mentioned at all. It's almost as if the director felt the assassin was a footnote.. completely beside the point in the epic life of America's greatest President.<br /><br />After reading about what Steven Spielberg went through to get this film done I am so grateful to him. It's a marvelous accomplishment and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

1616550414|5.0|Honestly, fist things first, for $20 this hardcover book is a steal! Even if you know nothing about the series or the games, this hardcover book is a beautiful addition to any coffee table! It just looks great from cover to cover.<br /><br />Secondly, the shipping is terrible, but I wont base my review on Amazon's horrible shipping practices. I know the book didn't come off the press damaged like this. I have the similar dings and damage on the cover others are complaining about, but that didn't take away from the content in the book itself.<br /><br />Lastly, I think Dark Horse and Nintendo outdid themselves on this book. It is awesome. I think it is great that they used a quarter of the book to explain skyward sword, while not my favorite game in the series, it is still the beginning of the timeline and needs all the explaining it can get. Skyward sword is the creation of Hyrule. Everything else that follows is in perfect order and explains the history of Hyrule. I'm not too sure why people are missing the opening (preface of the book) by Mr. Miyamoto where he explains in high level detail about what to expect from the book. I guess when I ordered it (before being able to see the first few pages), I expected it to be mostly about skyward sword but more so have coverage of the timeline which they do. The artwork is out of this world and throwing in the skyward sword comic book at the end, Superb! Even better, the comic reads from back to front (Manga style) just like traditional Chinese style.<br /><br />I could go on forever (this is the Bible of Zelda after all). But if you are a true Zelda fan (or even if you're not) this book at $20 is not disappointing, even if you just throw it on the coffee table for others to poke through.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Elton John's most important and well-known songs are here in this 2-CD collection.  Fans will certainly get a lot of pleasure out of this collection, but even just casual listeners (and I'm one of them) will enjoy hearing their favorite songs.  No filler - just the best.

B005LAIIJY|3.0|Django is an uneven film that has some great scenes and dialogue but it does not work well as the whole thing. Besides, the main character, Django, is neither compelling nor sympathetic. He is too violent to be a hero; a slave by heart and a villain by deeds, he has no moral principles and kills defenceless women and unarmed people. Compare Django to Clint Eastwood's character from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Who would you prefer to meet in a dark alley?<br /><br />Tarantino proves one more time that he is a master of great short novels, but he is unable to create an all-of-a-piece feature film. If The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is the 5 star standard of spaghetti-westerns, Django Unchained deserves only 3.

I would highly recommend this app. However, I really wish the password actually worked because I'm very specific on who can see my unfinished works. Also, the covers were of good variety, but I still wish there was more.

B00136Q342|5.0|There is a reason this ablum is still on the top 100 of my list.  The $2.99 special was a steal.  If you were alive when this came out, you may remember what a success it was against all odds.  If you have never listened to it, you are missing a recording of an incredible talent and a very great live concert at Folsom.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|For anyone who likes witty comments, quirky personalisties, communities, family or even romance than this series is perfect.<br />If focuses on the daily lives of mother/daughter team: Lorelai and Rory Gilmore.  This series starts off with Rory at 16 and her mother, who had Rory and left home when she was 16.  for all these years they have relied on each other but when Rory gets an offer to prestigious school, financial hardships follow and  Lorelai turns to her parents for assistance.  This first season focuses on the precarious relationship they two have with the Lorelai's parents.  In addition, thoughout the series we get to meet the fascinating people of Stars Hollow (where they live).  Exuberant Sookie, the ornery yet caring Luke, the noisy neighbors, stunted Kirk and many more loveable characters.  As all drama's must we also get to join the Gilmore's in some of their relationships as well.<br />Do not think that this series is only for females!  I know guys who would watch episodes with me and would get a kick from the wittism shown and the fast paced dialogue with pop- culture references makes this fun for everyone.  So while its perfect to sit and watch with you mom, grandmother, daughter, etc; feel free to watch it with your boyfriend, husband, neighbor, etc.  The lighthearted comedic side is a perfect blend to its drama/family counterpart.<br />The packaging is also nice her.  each disc gets its own side to click into a plastic holder, so no more discs stacking one ontop another.  This really seems to help with avoiding scratches.  So sit back with your favorite snacks ( I guarantee you'll see the Gilmore Girls do the same throughout the show), grab a friend or family member and enjoy the show.

0375758992|5.0|Exceptionally well written, riveting, vivid & spell binding, but a no-holds barred quite  frightening biography of growing up in Africa, largely in Rhodesia in the era of Ian Smith's gov't when white settlers so wrongly considered that their black servants/employees \\"were happy\\" & that things would go on that way for the long haul.  Very colorful portraits of family members all of who were extremes of one sort or another.  Despite all the intense tragedies in her family's life, the author's love of Africa is deeply ingrained, as is her love for her flawed and damaged (surviving) family members.  She is a wordsmith, so the quality of writing adds greatly to the story she tells.  Although the tale she tells frequently fills the reader with horror, it also contains humor and expresses her deep affection for the land, and for the peoples who so incongruously shared the land.  But she pulls no punches about the graft, corruption, violence & self-serving greed she observed, nor  the stark harshness of life there.  Brings the newspaper headlines of those days to life, vividly.  An unforgettable book.

B000MV8AE0|1.0|Write-ups described this product as outstanding, but I found the story--made up--was boring and far below the other Beethoven movie, Immortal Beloved. Ed Harris' performance did not equal his best or even his average acting. A waste of time and money.  Do not buy this disappointment.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked it but,there were some really sad parts in it. Read it but expect some really sad parts. Nice

B007THA4FI|5.0|I have never been drawn to Harry Potter but this book piqued my interest and did not disappoint. Beautifully written, I became immersed in this story largely due to Rowling 's brilliant character development. Such an enjoyable book with a lesson or two about life. I would gladly follow these characters through a series of books.  Anyone who enjoys Coronation Street will love this book

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read. Couldn't put it down. I would definitely recommend this book. The story line is heartbreaking and heart warming.
B00ARIO7PO|5.0|This is a trance mix of some Oldfield tracks.<br /><br />It is not fair nor appropriate to compare it to Oldfields standard compositions.<br /><br />If you don't like trance music you will not like this album.<br /><br />Tracks 1, 2, 3 and 11 are amazing, even epic.<br /><br />The rest are good trance mixes, nothing special - guilty, to france and moonlight shadow we have heard a million times - perhaps a broader choice would have been better.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I saw some of Downton Abbey on PBS and ordered the set so that I could catch up.  This program is fabulous.  I have already loaned it to several others who also fell in love with the program and are waiting to watch season three (when I'm done with it!).
0345803507|5.0|Well I don't know what all the haters are on about but I loved this final book in the Fifty Shades trilogy. In fact for me each book just got better, with \\"Freed\\" becoming my favourite. Granted I had a few issues, like the constant Mr. Grey/Mrs. Grey every single time they addressed each other, which was all cute and newlywedish at first and then just proceeded to drive me crazy. But I still had trouble putting this one down; I am a total sucker when it comes to the tortured hero so I understood my falling for Christian but Ana surprised me and I came to appreciate her as she grew a backbone and learned how to handle her man and his many moods.<br /><br />Plus there's an actual story here; I mean stuff happens other than in the playroom. We get car chases, assorted stalkers, blips, kidnappings, bar fights, car accidents, drunk Christian, out of control Christian, raging Christian, playful Christian, needy f'd up Christian it was just such an all-out emotional journey and managed to leave me shocked several times. I also found it fascinating to watch Christian lose control and for Ana take it, not what I was expecting but all his shades finally made sense.<br /><br />Ana's hilarious inner goddess is still with us and I was happy to see the inclusion of more sexy, fun, playful or in this case argumentative e-mails as Ana tries to stand her ground against a very controlling and used to being in charge Christian. These things were part of what separated Fifty from the Twilight universe for me and also why James' writing grew on me since that first book which felt immature, you could really hear her voice here and I now can't wait to see what she writes next.<br /><br />I also loved the ending which finally \\"freed\\" Christian and left me in a very happy place; it just felt so complete, like okay you guys are going to make it, thanks for the journey. Of course this could have something to do with the many assorted epilogues we get, my favourite being the inclusion of Christian's Midnight Sun-ish POV first meeting of Ana. I would read the whole series again from inside his head. Laters.<br /><br />\\"I need control Ana. Like I need you. It's the only way I can function. I can't let go of it. I've tried... And yet, with you...\\" He shakes his head in exasperation. I swallow. This is the heart of the dilemma -his need for control and his need for me. I refuse to believe these are mutually exclusive.\\"<br /><br />\\"Do you want a drink?\\" I ask super sweetly.<br />\\"No thanks\\" he says not taking his eyes off me, and I know that he's helpless. He does not know what to do with me. It's comical on one level and tragic on another.\\"tian's Midnight Sun-ish POV first meeting of Ana. I would read the whole series again from inside his head.

B0042816YK|5.0|This film made me think even more about having my best life possible. It definitely made me think about life changes and about taking risks. If you have been through divorce, this is also a good film to watch. It is also about forgiving yourself and letting go of the past. I highly recommend this film.

1449410243|4.0|Great little book, and now that the price has dropped it's worth the money.  I too wasn't that impressed by half of it being the bob-cats, but that's ok.  The other content of the book is still hilarious, though some of it has already been on his website for some time.  I don't mind though, he's a talented guy and sending a little money his way is my little way to say &#34;thanks&#34; for all of the free stuff I've enjoyed online!
0007447868|5.0|There are two main complaints about this book:<br /><br />1)  Not enough happens in it.<br />2) WHERE ARE MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS?!?!!?!<br /><br />The funny thing is that the last chapter addresses the audience directly and answers these questions.  The book was too long to publish by itself so rather than split it down the middle GRRM decided to break it up by characters.<br /><br />Personally I think this is a brilliant decision.  The first two books are pretty consistent in terms of action, but 'Clash of Kings' is so crammed with surprises that it dramatically changes the landscape of the series.  Continuing that level of action unabated would get boring after a while (to say nothing of the fact that there wouldn't be any characters left to write about).  'A Feast for Crows' helps to give context and meaning to the previous books by focusing on what the characters have lost, how it's changed them, and the unintended consequences of their actions.<br /><br />It also lets us catch our breaths after book three, and leaves us wanting more for book five.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enjoyed reading this novel as it was not just a love story, it took a  family destroyed by tragedy and helped them heal. It was filled with suspense, fear and joy. Can't wait to see the movie.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|A follow up to the original movie, this movie has just as much excitement and enjoyment as the original. Definitely worth getting.

B007XIC1GI|5.0|Marilyn Manson will always remind me of that deep well of imaginative, fantastical nonsense that is the collective mind of christian fundamentalists. As someone born in the early 90's, he was the guy the older kids were warned about by the well-meaning-if-zealously-nonsensical spokespeople of my various local congregations. Warnings that filtered down to us.<br /><br />He sacrifices animals onstage<br /><br />Made a pact with the devil<br /><br />Worst of all; he is a homosexual<br /><br />Presumably all stuff they said about Black Sabbath in the 70's and Motley Crue in the 80's. Gun's and Roses in the early 90's. Sinatra in the 50's.<br /><br />And it will probably never end<br /><br />Anyways, now for the review:<br /><br />Brian Werner (birth name) was born and raised in a small town in Ohio. It seems like from an early age his life was filled with the disgusting and obscene. Central to this book are themes of unbleonging, anti-social anger, social disgust, filth, and the character of Werner's grandfather; an off-putting, strange old man with perverse, obscene habits indulged in from his filthy basement. The story arch is not really a personal one, despite the tital, because Manson barely changes his personality beyond the 3rd chapter, but really it is the story of his rising from a hated freak on a local level, to a hated freak on the international stage.<br /><br />The book is vulgar, as you'd expect, but if i'm reading a rock star's biography its just what i would expect. What did put me off was how gross everything was. Piss, blood and vomit make an appearance every few pages. A girl smokes old ground up bones from a bong. Manson picks up a broken beer bottle and cuts his chest open. Werner's grandfather jacks off unknowingly in front of his 13 year old grandkid. Manson himself is not a pretty sight to see. This man is obsessed with filth.<br /><br />Manson is profoundly arrogant, like most people who enter being hated and self-hating are, and this book is filled with his various judgments and insights. Christians do not come off well; neither do Americans. Moralizers come off immoral. Manson is hyper sensitive to such hypocrisy.<br /><br />The most prominant celeb featured in Trent Reznor, who signed Manson and was there for his mainstream breakout. Traci Lords and Jemma Jameson both make appearences, as well as Courtney Love, and Connan O'Brian. But most of the chacters are personal friends, acquaintances, enemies.<br /><br />And as you'll notice from the heading, Neil Strauss was \\"involved\\" with the writing, making the prose superb.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent rock bio, excellent peice of writing, and fascinating story. His unique story makes this a worthwhile read even to those who would never listen to his industrial garbage-pop.lled with his various judgments and insights.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I chose this book because it was offered to me thru Amazon for a deep discount and I'm so glad I did! A great read! You can identify with all of the characters-just like your family & friends. I would definitely recommend this book! Well done Ms. McKenna :-)
B003E2UQMS|3.0|I usually like reading books that have been made into movies. I have never been as disappointed as with this one. The book and the movie are very different, the movie is a romance, the book isn't. I really don't know what I was expecting, but it was definetly not what I got.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Love the Jack Reacher books - once I start reading, can't put them down and this one was no different.

B0066W1AZK|4.0|I constantly loose , but it was free when I got it so its all good. I'd recommend it if you wanted a tough opponent, but I think the computer difficulty can be turned up and down to get a level you could play at and still feel challenged
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gave the rating of five Stars because I really enjoyed the hunger games it was a thrilling book about a girl named Katniss Everdeen a 16 year old girl volunteer to take part in the 74th hunger games instead of her sister Primrose the hunger games in a live television programme were one girl and one boy between the ages of 12-18 are chosen to take part in the hunger games were they must fight to the death but only one can come out alive I would recommend this book to children between the ages of 12-19 because the book contains some inappropriate words. The book is written by Suzanne Collins.
B007SGM084|1.0|Felt like this was a big waste of money and time.  I very seldom don't finish a book - BUT I didn't even make it half way through the first one. The writing was so 'clunky' it became impossible to carry on!
0805047905|5.0|This book is not only educational for small children, but they love it.  All 7 of my grandchildren have asked me to read it to them more than any other of the dozens of books they have to choose from.  The also are not happy with just one reading.  They want to hear it 6 or 7 times even though by then they have memorized the text.

B000687M48|5.0|What more can I say, I grew up with Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, Heart, etc. and Amy Lee of Evanescence is right up there with the best and probably can outsing a few of whom I mentioned.  She definately hits the emotional chord of anyone who can relate to her music.

B005HSL626|5.0|An 11 year old girl showed me her new Christmas present about 5 years ago.  It was an iPad and Fruit Ninja was loaded. I was enchanted and loved the action!!!  I've been jealous ever since of all the kids - little and big - with big screen tablets.<br /><br />I've had an iPhone (with Fruit Ninja installed) for a few years and thought that was fine. This week I purchased a Galaxy 7&#34; tablet and the first thing I loaded was Fruit Ninja, of course.  The bright graphics, the challenge (I know, a mindless challenge), and the sheer pleasure of this device in my hand is great. Simple and fun.<br /><br />And the Samsung Tab 2 is fun, too.
B00364K6YW|2.0|Beware, the 2010 \\"restored\\" edition is incomplete. It's missing Episode 4.<br /><br />Disc 1 contains Episodes 1-3<br />Disc 2 contains Episodes 5-6

I sent a picture to my husband - smart man that he is, he picked up on that HINT and I just received my copy for Valentine's Day!  Perfect perfect perfect.  Love the artwork, both what we've seen in the games as well as what didn't make it in.  Love reading the histories (different timelines).  I wish I could curl up in this and never come out.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|IT JUST SEEMED LIKE AN AWFUL LOT OF READING UNTIL THE ACTION BEGAN.  DEFINITELY NOT MY FAVORITE NELSON DEMILLE NOVEL.

0345803485|5.0|borrowed the series from my sister just finished the first book and i loved it so much...wish that it would have ended differently but the book is still awesome as heck cant wait to start on the next book i do recommend this book to people but it does have a lot of sex scenes in it but it doesmt distract from the book
B0029LHWFO|2.0|I rated this two stars only because it was well edited. The story itself seems to be an effort of Obama to redefine his life story for his own devices. His anecdotes seem contrived when they dis white people, wealthy people, corporations, oil companies and all the regular bugaboos of leftists.<br /><br />Although the story is fictionalized in that certain folks and events are composites, I just flat don't believe his story how rich white folks used to walk their dogs into his neighborhood to crap - that's just pure you-know-what.<br /><br />All in all, a self-aggrandizing story by a self-aggrandizing man.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed the book, though I found it a little technical in parts.  But then, that's probably how a neurosurgeon would write it.  I have to say, I've enjoyed seeing him interviewed a little more than I enjoyed the book.  What I find most encouraging about what he writes and what he says in interviews is that we can experience \\"being in spirit\\" even now, if we only put in the work.  He mentioned Centering Prayer once, and I've done some reading on that, and am trying it.  It's challenging to let my ego-driven \\"thoughts\\" go, but the glimpses I get for the few seconds at a time I can achieve that encourage me to keep going.<br /><br />One thing I do wish is that he would have gone more into the questions he asked during his experience, and the answers he received.  He does mention that it will take the rest of his life to unpack even most of it, but a taste of that might have helped.<br /><br />Overall, a very good book.  (But he's better in interviews)
B009O2XY12|2.0|does not let me continue without purchasing :(. Its a great game but just when you think you got it, it starts asking to purchase to go to another level and that just kills the fun and my kids were all into it..
B00B7803HO|5.0|My husband and I like predicting what is going to happen.  We both think that Bates' wife did not kill herself, but neither did Bates.  We remember that Sir Richard Carlyle threatened Vera. Perhaps he had something to do with her death.  Perhaps he paid someone to kill her and then blame her husband. Sir Richard would also have contacts in the prison system to see to it that Bates is kept in prison. If Bates is considered guilty then no one will look elsewhere for the killer.  If Sir Richard is responsible for the death of Vera, then he really will go after Mary for gilting him.<br />Edith's position with a newspaper will probably save the family, since Lord Grantham says it will do the opposite. In later episodes, Patrick is probably going to come back for Edith.  He did declared his childhood love for her.  Then Patrick and Edith will become heir to Downton Abbey. That should create a mess in the family since Matthew is buying into the estate.<br />The man who gilted Edith at the alter will leave his estate to her.<br />Some of our earlier predictions have been off the mark, but it is fun to see what transpires.
B007Y36K46|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but this movie turned out to be amazing.  If you like a mix of SciFi/Action/Adventure/Fantasy this movie has all of it with some romance thrown in.

B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Based on the trailer I thought this was going to be more of a legal thriller movie, but it's 2 hours of Denzel Washington getting drunk and making an ass out of himself.

B003F5NSTW|5.0|This book is engaging, disturbing and thought provoking. I absolutely loved it. It has all the elements I love in a book, and I thought the characters were very realistic. You still think about it for a long time after you finish it. If you like books that are raw, mysterious and original, you will love this book. I highly recommend it, and this is the first time I have ever given a book 5 stars!

B0074D3CAQ|2.0|. Very slow and depressing.Characters not developed enough. Needed more light moments to balance it out.  Sounded like it had much potential going in, but didn't deliver.
B00119ZMKW|4.0|Enjoyable series for the entire 10 year run, fun mythology and a nice sense of humor. A fun watch on slow day.
B00BBIAB0Y|5.0|I like this story the best of the 11 that I've read. This kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the story. I had to wait till it was republished with \\"additional material\\" so read third book and this one. You have to read in order one to the end for the most enjoyment.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|A must have drama!  I couldn't stop watching it, finished the whole season over a weekend!  4 more words needed... ha
B002PNDEXK|5.0|This movie captured the witty dialogue and tangled relationships of Jane Austen's wonderful novel.<br />Great acting. The casting was superb.
0743277708|5.0|but leaves me feeling empty, I miss them.  It's like the feeling you get after watching the series finale of your favorite show- 'I can't believe it's over, goodbye my friend.' :(<br />I miss my bunnies.  Such an epic.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Must read these three books in the trilogy by Stieg Larsson.  So sorry there won't be anymore from this author.  N Moore
B003NBFZTE|5.0|Purchased the item online and when item was received, I was pleased to see that the quality was good and image on online site was a good pick of the real thing ... thanks for the listing.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|The movie is charming, funny, and appeals to my gaming lifestyle. I love the story the adorable characters, the animation the voice acting everything! I recommend this to everyone.
630514415X|5.0|I am a big fan of Denzel washington's work and I am a Spike lee film buff. I love his portrayal of the up and coming college prospect and gave the world a different perspective of what the recruiting process is like from a players perspective from a low income community. instantly became a fan of Ray Allen. Great job Spike!!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I have read all three books in the trilogy.  I would recommend these three books as must read for anyone who loves to read a book that keeps you guessing all the way to the last page.  N Moore
B00AQMQBKK|1.0|I hate paying for something that don't work. This is one of those somethings. It will not install on my HTC Rezound.
B0009VSB06|5.0|This metal detector was purchased for our 9 year old grandson for Christmas. Not only was it a big hit, but it is a great metal detector.  It is easy enough for a child, while being good enough for an adult!  I read all the reviews, & they didn't steer me wrong!  I would recommend this for anyone loving to find treasures!
B000001DZM|5.0|I bought this cd in combo with the Blu Ray dvd, great copy, brand new and I am so happy!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Epic it is really buuut..... um well you didn't give me excitement and adventure I'm not sayin that you should improve this I'm sayin you should make more episodes or more things to create and also let us fuse more than 2 things at the same time.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I use this to stream Youtube videos onto my 46&#34; HDTV.  Makes laughing at rapping birds or people wiping out even funnier when it's large.
B007SGM084|5.0|Aside from all the love scenes (putting it mildly) it's actually a very sweet love story.  I tore through the books so fast I had to go back and read it a second time to catch things I missed.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book is a awesome book thank you for letting me read it love it so much I couldn't take my eye off it
0783114893|1.0|Thid movie refused to play.  I think the copy is very old or defective.  I'm a C. Thomas Howell fan, but I don't know if I liked this movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't usually go for this sort of thing.  I follow Grey's Anatomy, Bones, Once Upon a Time, Game of Thrones, X Files etc.  I am more into science and science fiction rather than drama, but  I am staying up until midnight or later and watching 2 or 3 episodes a night.  I cannot pin down what has gotten me hooked.  I've seen better acting and the plot is somewhat predictable, but I do love the costumes.  I have been brought to tears by the story several times.  I have laughed as well.  Characters are well developed and yet evolving.  If you have watched it, give it a try.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is a good game to play it is active and fun game you get to change your player to run but you have to get money to get the other people it is fun when the big monkey come and chasing you. TEMPLE RUN 2/ TEMPLE RUN ARE BOTH ARE A AWESOME. GAME TO PLAY.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|&#34; Gilmore Girls: The Complete Fifth Season&#34; is everything I hoped and more. Now I have the complete set!<br />Looking forward to my next purchase.
1594744769|5.0|Very good tale and fun to read.  I got caught up in the storyline early and thoroughly enjoyed the crazy photos.
B0042RUMG4|1.0|The conditions of the product I ordered are not good!It seems like has been used and sombedey threw it in the garbage and the send it to me<br />SUCKS!
B003HV0TN2|5.0|I was hooked by the main character, Kvothe within the first few pages - and the tantalising glimpse of what might come.  I like the way the author has built a story within a story.  The pace was easy to keep up with, and the characters well described and built upon.  I was barely able to put this book down at night to sleep.  Cant wait to read the next in the series.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|more of the same, no real surprises and what seemed like an imagination that started to run low.  i'm not sure what the movies will do
B00792EGES|5.0|This Blu ray is awesome. I love it. It has all the great AB songs. The quality is excellent and the documentary is preety good.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|Got this set for my nephew's 9th birthday.  He loved it and it was a great counterpoint to the millenium falcon set his parents got him.  Combined he got all the main characters from the movies plus some bad guys and an extra ship! What else can you say....  Legos are legos. I don't remember a huge number of unique pieces in this set.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show gets better and better with each season. I also like that amazon gives you a little reminder when your show is up and ready for you to watch.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Although this is not the whole play as I expected, they music is wonderful and the vocalists beautiful.  Very moving.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I was with Harold all the way. A little dark at times but overall an up lifting story. The author does a good job of letting you travel with Harold, even if at times you want to slap Harold on the side of the head.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|A nice indie flick. Kudos to Helen Hunt for going the &#34;full Monty&#34;  Very we'll done on on interesting and tough subject. Worth the watch.
B007NCTWX4|5.0|Liked this artists music from radio, and wasn't disappointed with the album. Doesn't always work that way so I was pleased.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm always on the lookout for good sci fi and fantasy novels, but they are very few & far between. The Wool series really surprised me. Great premise, good character development, plausible tech & situations. Great stuff and self-published besides. Welcome to the future!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a very well written series with exceptional actors.  It really stimulates interest to quickly move onto view the next episode.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|This album reminded me of albums froms decades past that only had 9 or so songs, and still managed to be killer, such as Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\", Billy Joel's \\"The Stranger\\", etc. This album isn't perfect, but it's damn good! There are some really funky tracks here, and he seems to be showcasing his voice a bit more freely here than on the first record. I was torn with his debut, because it seemed like this cross between grown man R&B/soul, and light hearted kid friendly pop songs. Well, he's let loose the grown man side fully here and without restraint, which is nice to see, and he does it while paying homage to some really funky genre styles.<br /><br />Young Girls is probably my favorite song. The record is bright with a strong chorus. I was surprised it wasn't chosen as the second single, but it's inevitably going to make it to radio sooner or later. Many of these songs could.<br /><br />Locked Out of Heaven is an instant classic. The funky chords and melodies here instantly remind one of Sting (who sang this record with Bruno at the grammys by the way...fit him like a glove), and in spite of cheeky lyrics like \\"your sex takes me to paradise\\", the record proves to be an anthem.<br /><br />Gorilla is another unabashed sex anthem. Quite catchy and raw in it's vocal delivery.<br /><br />Treasure is pure funk heaven. I hope this gets a single release too. Radio needs something like this. My only nitpick on this song is that I sort of wish there were some female background vocals.<br /><br />Moonshine wasn't a favorite of mine. It was ok, and will probably grow on me eventually, but I thought using the same exact drums from \\"treasure\\" was a weak production decision.<br /><br />When I Was Your Man is such an emotive piano ballad. It's really growing on me every time I replay it. A true highlight here, and another classic in the making.<br /><br />Natalie. This one is growing on me. The production seems to overshadow the lyrics and the concept for me, but it's alright.<br /><br />Show Me. This one seems a bit under produced in areas, but is a great reggae tune...far superior to the Damian Marley duet from his debut! Would be nice to see this make the radio playlists also.<br /><br />Money Make Her Smile. Bruno's first heavy hitting hip hop record goes IN! Love the production here. And the song has so much attitude. Love rocking out to this.<br /><br />If I Knew & Old & Crazy seem like demos that were left on the cutting floor. They are just barely 2 minutes each and though they sound good, they're just way too short for me.<br /><br />This album is really fun, but it's quite short and doesn't ever seem to come full circle due to that length. If you like soul and pop of the present day or the past decades, you'll enjoy this. Give it a shot!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|She's 6. I hate all the in app purchases though. She can't do it, but it's annoying they have so many.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|I was greatly disappointed in that what I thought would be an uplifting movie was instead a slog through disease, dispair and disaster.  Just a terrible movie and the waste of a decent cast.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Interesting story reminiscient of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt thrillers.  Just enough science to provide a thread of plausibility to a globe-trotting chase/battle to save the world. Fun.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is a great mixture of classic Bond action and adds a more human element to the fold.<br />What makes Bond tick and showing the depth of his loyalty.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|wonderful for fans of the band is a spectacular show,<br /> great songs, great quality audio and video.<br />I was very happy
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good read.  Lots of action. Looking foreward to reading more of the Jack Reacher books in the days to comed.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My wife and I just watched RIO last night. Other than the reviews supplied by buyers at Amazon, we didn't know what to expect. The first thing I said after we watched the movie was I would watch it again. It was fun from the beginning to the end. I actually felt like we were in Rio watching all the action as the birds tried to get out of their troubles. This is truely a movie for ALL ages. Anyone reading this review, take my word for it and buy this movie. It will put a smile on your face.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics and story line. Was a lot of fun to play couldn't put it down. Hoping there's a sequel.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Really great game. Lots of fun! Good special effects and good decorations. I look forward each day to see what is coming next.
B009T3AE1Y|2.0|I'm a big fan of Mr. Cronenberg. I've seen quite a few of his films and ever since watching it, Spider was my absolute least favorite of his. In fact, I hated that film. Well, Cosmpolis has now easily taken its place. This movie is so pretentious, bloated and dismally boring, that I'm not exactly sure what attracted such big stars as Juliette Binoche and Paul Giammati to join in. I'm excluding Rob Pattinson because I'm sure he was quite honored(and thankful) to be starring in such a different film coming off his Twilight streak.  Anyway, the plot revolves around a billionaire (Pattinson) who wants to get a haircut, way across town (Manhattan). His personal bodyguard/security is against this idea and numerous times throughout the film tries to veer him away from his haircut idea. Almost the entire movie takes place in his white stretch limo. Inside, he meets throughout the day with various people, some for business, some for pleasure. Oh yes, he even gets a prostrate exam(which he apparently does every day) in the limo by a doctor. At breakfast time and lunch he meets up with his wife, who is even more emotionally barren than he is. There is zero indication of what attracted these two to begin with. Aside from wealth (and their dead eyes), they seem to have nothing in common. Clearly, his character is a sociopath, a cheater and emotionally whacked. But none of these facts make the film any more interesting. In fact, I can't even count the times I nearly fell asleep. Too much talk, most of it seemingly random and not making much sense. The tone is deliberatly monotone, which doesn't help one's acting abilities. It all just seems so scripted and strange. It's such a departure from Cronenberg that one would never even recognize his work here. I can't recommend this.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I had difficulty reading this book.  However, I do believe it was more my eyes than the book.  I did later see the movie and really enjoyed it.  I may try to read it yet.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|this band is great reminds me of a ZZ Top style music. First heard them when I bought the 2013 Grammy cd and then I had to have more.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game! Challenging enough to keep you entertained and the occasional hint eliminates the frustration that makes you want to quit. More please.
B0013O123Q|5.0|brutal movie, but am I glad I watched it!!!!!!!!!! Monica Bellucci is great.I  highly recomend it. Must see movie. WOW
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the game is very realistic. you can muck out a stall and groom a horse. you mix the feed given to the horse. you can choose your riding outfit. great app.
0385344228|3.0|A pretty good book but failed by erring with major elements in my opinion.  It would have benefited from better editing and fact checking.  Spoiler alert - It is biologically impossible for a Father to pass on an X chromosome to his Son.  The Son's X chromosome comes from his Mother.  The Son also apparently suffered from some major trauma or neglect during his childhood but this was left unexplored/unexplained.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Started out a little slow, but had a hard time putting it down after the first few chapters. Great story!
B005V2S7FW|4.0|LastPass is a very good storage app for user names and passwords.  The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is the learning curve involved.  Once understood, it is a lifesaver and seamlessly works across all my devices: PC, laptop, android phone, and Kindle HD Fire. I would highly recommend this app.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an engrossing and moving book.  So touching and heartfelt . . . Deeply satisfying.  Thank you for touching my heart.  I would defintely recommend this book and look forward to reading her other books too!!
B005PK56TA|4.0|This was a very strange series, but we enjoyed watching it. I wonder where people come up with these ideas?
0070511136|5.0|Was recommended by one of my friend. I liked the book. Cannot say that it is a must read but good read for sure.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is super fun.<br />I really recommend this fir a great app if you like animals and horses. If you just want to pretend that you have a horse then get the app!
B00A14V0MM|2.0|They left out the best songs from the movie. No White Stripes or Zeppelin.  That's the reason I wanted to buy the soundtrack.  Don't bother.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|This true story was really interesting. It was pretty long but it didn't seem like it was too long. We continued to talk about it even the next day. That is a sign of a good movie to me!
B00004Y6OA|5.0|The more I listen to Roth-Era Van Halen the more I forget who Sammy Hagar was...You can listen to the whole album without using the \\"skip\\" button. \\"Loss of Control\\" is the weakest one here.
B00005YJMX|3.0|the movie is good, but i would have love to see more of the vampyre , in the dvd comentary Werner Herzog, said that he didnt life the francis ford coppola version DRACULA , , but i liked coppola version better,
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I was in a situation where I was not able to receive a wireless signal at all on my network. I was going to have to relocate my adapter out on my patio and around the corner. It was refreshing to find a product that performed as advertised. I went from 0 bars to 4 bars as soon as I installed this extension. Ping test rates my connection now as \\"A\\". In the future I will not hesitate to contact Blue Rigger.<br />Update:This worked great for about 30 days then died a very quick and sudden death. In all fairness as I said above I did relocate the adapter to the patio and the patio is covered it is open on the front and back.
B0094K1MH2|2.0|I feel asleep while my husband watched this one. I heard him laugh out loud several times but he said later it was not a good movie.
044654759X|5.0|loved the book, got me hook with every single chapter.<br />not what you may expect from him but still it was something different.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|This book had some interesting aspects but as a mystery it was far fetched and rather amateurish.  The details regarding typography,Consolidated Long Term Storage, an inter museum archival and storage facility, and inner workings of Google, whether factual or not, were well done, however, the plot was more suited to a teen/twenty something reader than an adult. The author's exploration of the differences and similarities between book lovers and technologists intersect on many levels and give rise to conversations regarding the role of technology n our lives.  Many of the references to &#34;The Dragon Story Chronicles&#34;, Dungeons and Dragons and other computer games may find an audience, but it is not for everyone. Perhaps this is why I think the book is more suited to a younger audience who cannot imagine a world without computers.<br />I did miss more detailed development of many of the characters and found them to be one dimensional, i.e. Kat, Corvina, and even Mr. Penumbra himself.  While respectful of the author's decision not to reveal the codex vitae of Penumbra it left me with the sense of an unfinished story. The epilogue wraps up the loose ends of every character but I am not sure I really know Mr. Penumbra.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Although I consider Rambo 4 the best Sly movie of all times, this one is a contender. Nuke some popcorn, grab a 64oz soda and enjoy this wonderfully entertaining action movie.
1449415881|4.0|I bought this calendar last year after not having read any Dilbert comics in years.  It's still funny and perfect for my desk at work.  I got it again for 2013.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Its all about an Alcoholic's spiraling out of control life with no redeeming value.<br />Worst money i have ever spent, glad I didn't see it at theater.<br />John Goodman returns from the &#34;Big Lebowski&#34; was entertaining.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I bought this and it turned out to be a surprise when watching, it is intease and then you need a kleenex, and then you just want to yell at him.  Over all I like it and glad to have it in my collection.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Besides the action, the humor in traded insults, guy talk, and Marine jabber, is worth the price alone. Outstanding cinematography and story telling.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|You can't go wrong with Mission Impossible flixs. Action packed, same pilot as the others but good entertainment. Worth my viewing time,
B000AU9UYC|5.0|This is by far the best Batman series I have seen. It is closer to the dark comics I read as a child and I am looking forward to the second movie The Dark Knight.
B00999DFP0|5.0|I love this show, and these DVD's are wonderful, seasons 1-5, I can't wait for the next one to come out, because I want it too!
B004EPYZXK|1.0|Now I know why the price was so cheap. Slow, boring, and poorly written, directed, and, acted. I should have believed the reviews this time.
B004WKI204|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I'd recommend it to my friends. Tina had me really laughing. It was a quick holiday read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it deleted my saved data twice. I love the game and all but that data thing really got me mad
B00ATPVA78|1.0|The app wont open. Resources are not available? Is this being worked on? I've uninstalled and reinstalled it with no luck.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Good action and the ultra hot Jennifer Lawrence, so the ingredients are all there. A good portion of this movie was shot near where I live and some of it shot within walking distance of my home. (out in the middle of nowhere in the NC mountains) Most of extras are from here and it was fun to see people I know in the final cut of the movie.
B006L0A5P8|5.0|Get 1Password for all of your devices. You know you really should use a better password protocol but it's so hard to keep track of those random numbers and letters. Never fear... 1 Password is here. Generates wildly random and involved passwords and keeps track of them. AND can integrate with 1Password apps on all your devices. Look into it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It is a very interesting game. I love the hidden object game. I am going g to buy it because it is just that good of a game.
B00683JK9K|5.0|Sometimes I just like to play a quick game, and this is the perfect game for that. It's just simple and fast to piece together a puzzle
B0000640SB|5.0|Our original DVD was damaged and we ordered this to replace it. Jones and Smith hit it out of the park. We must have watched this movie ten times over the years.
0718157834|5.0|I found this book to be very moving.  The relationship between the characters was fascinating as it developed.  I love characters with spunk, and the heroine in this book certainly had plenty of that.  I couldn't put the book down as it drew to a close and there was a decision to be made.  I have to admit, I was suprised at the way the book ended.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game as well as others IE BS, RS, FS ARE A JOKE offered by this company is a rip off. It is too costly to play a free game. Team Lava takes money and does not give back to game players. Tricks players in a said contest to get them to buy gold and then does not put back into game. ISO(Apple) & ANDROID have new but KINDLE HAS AND GETS NOTHING !!! Look on their forum it says it all. UNFAIR. RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I found season #5 at Amazon.com. I had watched the first 4 seasons on Netflix and wanted more! Thank you Amazon. Now on to season #6
B005LAIGSC|4.0|Also, good camera work. I hate the blue tint effect and there is way too much of it in this movie. It's a good story and plenty of action, but too much blue, too much shaky cam, and too much grain. Still, I'd buy it again.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I think this game is way fun. takes time to get into .... but is worth it. Although there's not that many levels. I would have given five stars if it had more to it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|great character development, intriguing plot twists, and--as always--visually beautiful<br /><br />I gobble up these episodes rapidly, and wish each season were longer!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Baseball, romance and a grumbling, gruff old Clint Eastwood. What more could you ask for in a movie? This is a pic with an outfield piled high with appeal. The characters are so nicely defined that you're almost instantly drawn to them. The story of a dad and daughter's tug-and-pull relationship full of communication hurdles, painful loss, pride, past protectiveness, love and emotional distance—is well-written and wonderfully acted.<br /><br />And I  Don't even like baseball....
B006P0FICE|4.0|I bought this because the color and cinematography were so good when I saw it at the theater. It's a silly story with most of the performances phoned in, but good for a crummy winter afternoon where the weather sucks.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Great &#34;Feel Good&#34; video. It came very quickly. Thanks you for your service. Good to watch with your whole family.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|such a great show! i can't wait for more episodes to come out!!! definetly check out the other seasons too!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Had potential but flattens out after the first five minutes when you figer out everything and it goes into it's repeat, the repeat phase. Go to the beach instead or read something really interesting.
B0063FGFK0|5.0|Can't say enough good things about The Town. I have now watched it six or seven times and each time it's good. The Blu Ray is well done and has lots of extra features. I especially enjoyed the alternate ending, but am glad Ben A went with the one he did. The man is one helluva director and actor.
B00821OX98|5.0|This was an accidental finding on my kindle but  was hooked after the  first  30 minutes, characters are  well developed  with  twists and  turns you  don't see coming.  Can't wait for  season 3
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This DVD was very informative and I certainly would recommend it to anyone.  Makes you wake up to what's happening.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The most ridiculous plot by any means in anyones wildest imagination of a cocked up, alcoholic comercial airline pilot. Which is just asking to much when asking us to suspend disbelief. But if you like to see Denzel drunk or snorting cocaine in just about every scene this would be the movie for you.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was an enjoyable fiction that addresses several issues. The first was children being relinquished and being warehoused in the foster care system. The second was the feeling of abandonment that a throw away kid would endure and the permanent harm done to the fragile child's psyche. The third was the enjoyable almost dead art of the language of flowers. This was not war and peace; it was an enjoyable, very readable book.
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|The Lies of Locke Lamora is another very highly suggested work within the fantasy genre.  I picked it up expecting a cleverly written piece.  After finishing the book, I just felt very \\"meh\\" about it all.  More than anything, it was the reading of Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicles, previous to this book, that shows the myriad of flaws in Lies.  Probably an unfair comparison for Lynch to compete against.<br /><br />The idea of a street urchin rising to master thief of the city is nothing new, we've read it a million times before.  To overcome this cliche, a richly imagined world full of colorful characters is needed.  Lies attempts to go there, but the world and characterization fall so very flat.  I can't tell you much about Camorr other than there's some alien glass lying around that glows at sunset/night.  The descriptions felt rushed and don't grab the imagination.  The characters are just as flat.  I can tell you a little about Locke but between all of the rushed sequences and the such, I can't tell you much of anything about anyone else.  Calo, Galdo, Jean, Bug, Chains?  Very forgettable and unengaging (sp?).  Perhaps the most fascinating characters the book sees, the main villian and the mysterious leader of the spy network, are either dealt with too easily or not developed enough.  I was really interested in both of these characters...<br /><br />And then there's all the ill timed flashbacks to childhood sequences and mini-chapters, a couple of pages each, that explain why things are like they are in Camoor.  They too, distract from the story.  You're left feeling cheated as a clever concept is explained away very quickly.  It would have been much nicer to possibly see some character interactions that would have explained these things out in a more engaging manner.  Instead, we get quick history lessons.<br /><br />Again, it's just an overall meh book.  There's not a lot of interest to see where the next book goes.  I feel that if the Gray King was dismissed soeasily and we're just floating to another continent, then Locke feels like he may be embarking on a sitcom quest, where every little book as a tidy intro, middle and ending with no continuous flow between it all.  No thanks.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a very fun game. i find solving the puzzles from the outside in works best.  not for those who do not enjoy a challenge.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Good sleeper movie or background noise while your catching up on FB or reading something better. Did not watch to end...zzzzzz
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 10 yr old loves it.  Good graphics. Enough variety to keep her entertained.  Could use better instructions on some of the mini games.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was engaging from the start. I don't want to give too many details but it was a great read! There were many twists and turns which made it a very emotional read with an ending that has many readers fuming. I can't wait to discuss it at my book club.
0060987464|5.0|Love this book. Could not put it down, Manson is such an intelligent person. He did everything everybody else wouldn't do. Easy read.
B000RLHDUM|4.0|A really good popcorn night movie that's predictable but also fun to watch with your partner. Watching Rene Russo dance in a sheer dress is a good thing.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|Of all of his contributions to the musical development of jazz I'm sure Wayne Shorter will be forever known for two things: as the saxophonist in the mid 60's Miles Davis Quintet and as a founding member of Weather Report. As a solo artist during both these periods,and as a member of these bands Shorter did much to expand the musical language of jazz saxophone at least to the level that people such as Charlie Parker and John Coltrane had before him. The major difference with Wayne Shorter was he was always more keen to express his own individual talent in more of a band context-his sound achieving it's fullest flower under the banner of other bandleaders. On this album Wayne Shorter actually has a chance to be a band leader again,as he was in the 60's and take the lessons learned being a member of a band as he is front and center of one of his own.<br /><br />  The opening number \\"Orbits\\" is not as melody based as it is a very probing example of layered harmonies,largely from the piano of Danilo Perez. On \\"Starry Night\\",\\"S.S. Golden Mean\\" and \\"Plaza Real\\" are extremely spacious arrangements full of  beautifully cascading orchestral piano and drum fills. \\"Myrrh\\" and the closer \\"Unidentified Flying Objects\\" express a very stark and somehow more melodic expression of the way the album opened. The centerpiece of this is the 23 minute \\"Pegasus\\",on which the quartet is augmented by a horn orchestra called The Imani Winds showcases the collision of both the more harmonic sound of the quarter and the more melodic playing of the orchestral woodwinds. \\"Flying Down To Rio\\" and \\"Zero Gravity To The 10'th Power\\" both have more energized bossa nova type rhythms based more in that old \\"spanish tinge\\" than anything else on this album-with the whistling and concise soloing the effect is much more melodic.<br /><br />  Pulled together from a series of live recordings done from over the past four years,this music showcases a very different side of Wayne Shorter's musical personality. One reason is that his soloing is not the driving,dominant force in the music that it so often tends to be. It often flutters in and out of the songs in brief yet speedily played intervals and the solos never carry the spotlight. Rather it's the piano,the drums and the orchestrations-whether they be grand or minimal,that dominate the music on this album. On the other hand some of the advanced harmonies that make up this album take off into directions that even some of the more wild free jazz excursions of the past were not able to go. They are very emotionally communicative on a level that would be very hard to physically express-closer to the flavors of Coltrane and Pharaoh Sanders. And that articulation of musically expression of feelings outside happiness,sadness or anger will likely be at the essential appeal of the music here.One reason is that his soloing is not the driving,dominant force in the music that it so often tends to be.

B00AJLHUAS|5.0|One of the qualities that defined Bryan Ferry's lyrical,musical and personal presentation over the years has been cool elegance. It was one of the unique qualities that separated Roxy Music from the other rock bands of it's age. That quality was something that was very much reared in Harlem Renaissance era America when the Jazz Age,which gave this album it's title,helped to better the cultural standards of an needlessly oppressed race of human beings. Music Bryan himself faced his own challenges personally,such as being the first name on a T-shirt sold at Malcolm McLarens boutique featuring the names of musical artists that were \\"awful\\" and therefore to be despised during the punk generation. Realizing that his sense of style perhaps had more in common with the Duke Ellington's of the world,that is the ethic he decided to embrace with this new project by the Bryan Ferry Orchestra: rerecording song of the songs he and Roxy Music made reflecting that Harlem Renaissance era.<br /><br />  \\"Do The Strand\\" and \\"Love Is The Drug\\" are very much dominated by that \\"big four\\" beat that was key in separating dixieland jazz from the ragtime music that inspired it. Because they were slower songs anyway \\"Just Like You\\",\\"The Only Face\\", \\"The Bogus Man\\" and \\"Reason Or Rhyme\\" really emphasize the blues-the one common thread tying jazz,soul and rock n' roll of all varieties especially in the often brassy horn arrangements and heavily muted trumpet solos that (as they did in the time this music was originally being made) expressed sly sexuality. \\"Avalon\\" is the most captivating interpretation to me. While very much in keeping with the period instrumentation the arrangement is still very much out of the late 70's/early 80's art rock style that informed the original. It almost makes for a whole new way of viewing 20's era jazz. \\"Slave To Love\\",\\"This Is Tomorrow\\",\\"Virginia Plain\\" and even the slower and bluesier version of \\"This Island Earth\\" all reflect more vocal style horn soloing more in keeping with that of a singer.<br /><br />  Listening to this album,with was recorded not only with the instrumentation but the tinny low-fi production of it's origin source,I cannot help but think what might've happened if Duke Ellington had been alive today. Duke was always extremely keen on collaborating with new artists who were looking to reinvent the harmonic language of jazz. And was always effectively able to update his work. The fact that Bryan Ferry was looking at the same approach but going out it in the reverse fashion as to how Duke had done it might've actually resulted in a collaboration between the two on an album very much like this. Somehow,aside from the liner notes point about the influence of the writings of F. Scott Fitzgerald,that the spirit of Duke Ellington's orchestra was not deeply at work in this music. He and Ferry share such an important cultural aesthetic in common. Other reviews of this recording point that out consistently. And it is one of the key points of this captivating and musically unexpected album.in keeping with that of a singer.<br /><br />  Listening to this album,with was recorded not only with the instrumentation but the tinny low-fi production of it's origin source,I cannot help but think what might've happened if Duke Ellington had been alive today.

B007V65R54|5.0|I've been a fan of Nate Silver for quite some time.  He has always impressed me with his objectivity and open-mindedness, particularly in the political arena, where it is so hard to be unbiased.  He lays out, in a number of &#34;real world&#34; case studies, the pitfalls of prediction, annotating his perspectives with notes that let you follow some of the math as well.<br /><br />This book could not be more timely - we see predictive modeling everywhere, from Google searching to Netflix recommendations to what your smartphone is predicting you will want to type or see next.  Many people are convinced that this next big thing is an &#34;easy button&#34; solution that lets you figure out the future.  Nate's cautionary guidance is a persuasive and readable narrative that walks readers through the dangers of (just to highlight some really significant takeaways for me): (1) relying too much on the past to predict the future, (2) relying too much on your assumptions going into a forecasting scenario and not paying attention to patterns and past data, (3) letting your biases and assumptions, many of which you don't even recognize, prevent you from correcting course as you go along, (4) letting the data &#34;speak for itself&#34; without letting common sense take the wheel, and (5) giving &#34;experts&#34; too much credit without doing some legwork on your own to test their assumptions and approaches.<br /><br />The narrative itself gets a little meandering and unfocused toward the later half of the book, and Nate's almost religious love of Bayesian approaches (which tells us we have to use the past to forecast the future, and keep changing that calculus as new data comes up) gets a little heavy handed at times, but his message is great.  Trust nothing, verify everything, keep an open mind, and keep testing / reevaluating as you learn more.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

0307730697|4.0|Disclosure: I approached this book as a biography and a potential book for teaching, and that is how my review is biased here. I will also be adding personal notes as to the impressions this book left me with as well.<br /><br />Summary<br />Fearless is the story of Adam Brown, a former Navy SEAL that died during his service to the American and Afghanistan people after 9/11. It is, however, not exclusively about his life as a SEAL, but rather his life. It starts with him as a rather wild and \\"reckless\\" child and follows his life through the fearless teen, to the tortured young adult, and onto the determined hero.<br /><br />While this book is the story of a single man, you also get to know his family, friends, and colleagues that tell his story. There is a little bit about the training he went through, but only enough to remind you of how much grit Brown had -- or how much insanity depending on how you look at it. It is a biography of Adam Brown, and to read it as a book about the SEALs would put the reader at a slight disadvantage.<br /><br />Analysis<br />Adam Brown is a relatively well known name in the small sphere of us that study military history. The entire world knows his team of Navy SEALs team SIX. When I had a chance to review this book, it was with the idea in mind that I would potentially use it as a teaching device. I was completely and totally blown away by it's content.<br /><br />To read this book as a biography, you get the following information (in what I thought was the most obvious to the least obvious):<br /><br />  The story of Adam Brown's life and what drove him<br />  Information about the Navy SEALs training and what's expected of them<br />  A scant amount of information in the way the SEAL teams operate in the field<br />  Insight of a drug addict's way of life<br />  Insight of what it takes to be a humanitarian in the war<br />  Insight of a particular branch of Christian faith (if they said which one in particular, I don't recall it)<br />  Insight into the quintessential military family life (through many examples, not just the Browns' family)<br />  Insight of a \\"good ol' country boy's\\" teenage years -- apparently it is rather stereotypical.<br /><br />The readability of this book is very easy, even for those that don't speak in the military acronyms. Yes, there are some, but they are explained and used in such a way that they are easily kept track of.<br /><br />Personal thoughts<br />This book is emotional, and at times quite intense. There were times when I could put it down without a problem, and other times when I found myself weeping -- particularly at the end. The author said it best in his afterword with this quote:<br /><br />  Even with the knowledge that Adam truly was ready -- boy and soul -- to give up his life in the line of duty, the final chapters of this book were heartrending to write. I knew what was coming, but I hoped for a different outcome... somehow.<br /><br />I felt the same way.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line I also began to think of Adam's story in terms of a Homerian Epic. He's a traditional hero, in the classic Greek sense. He was born broken (they had to dislocate his shoulder to get him out of the womb), had a myriad of trials and tribulations and still pushed through it to become a better man and eventually a hero. I'm one of the most non-religious and non-spiritual person ever, but even I had to think that this person was touched by gods. If there were ever to be a modern day epic made, Adam would have to be the hero.<br /><br />Now, to touch on the religious aspect of the book since it seems to get so much flack. The Browns are deeply religious, and this is a biography. You can't separate the two elements and end up with the same story. For those that are shying away from this book due to the religious element -- DON'T. It's not preachy. It is more inspirational and insightful than anything.<br /><br />So, after all this, why not a 5-star review? It is because I felt things were incomplete. I have been in the military and study tactics, so this is natural for me. Fortunately, this has absolutely nothing to do with the way Blehm writes it, but everything to do with the fact that I wanted more information that he couldn't disclose for security reasons. For example, I felt it was stupid to put the men down in an area where they'd have a 6 hour hike to their objective. Common sense says, \\"Of course they are going to be exhausted and not do as well as they could. Of course there are going to be problems later on with that sort of planning.\\" I do not blame the author for this -- it's just part of the problem when writing modern military books; you can't put all the details in that fanatics like me want.<br /><br />Disclaimer<br />I received this book from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group. I am under no obligation to write a positive review, just an honest one.

B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|This is one \\"horror\\" that fails to deliver on all counts.  While there was a brief period in the first half when I thought the film contained a substantial amount of atomsphere that I'd probably be able to end up giving the movie 3 stars, unfortunately it never improves.  The nonsensical communication between the two main characters ends up wandering WAY too long and thus, completely destroys all potential this movie had.  I fully expectd an improvement in storytelling to eventually occur but, again, it never comes.  Basically other than the surprise ending, the Innkeepers disappoints.<br /><br />It's about the character of Sara Paxton roaming around a hotel with a haunted history.  She apparently works there at night.  A computer-obsessed geeky guy plays the role of the second biggest character and he works behind the counter... I guess.  He spends most of his time on the computer or sleeping upstairs so his job is really easy.  He's more like an arrogant know-it-all that never wins me over that's for sure, whereas Sara is more of a curious almost jaunty teenager constantly on the alert and jumping around at the slightest bumps she encounters in the night.  The other characters that occasionally enter the picture (such as the old woman in the room upstairs and the curious old man that wants a specific room because it contains memories) never accomplish anything meaningful and simply feel tacked on for the sake of character diversity.<br /><br />Well apparently this old hotel is haunted, so Sara spends all her time walking around exploring at least half of the rooms.  Most of her time is spent in the main room downstairs.  However, the problem is that (despite a complete lack of atomsphere and horror of course) on several occasions, Sara and the geeky guy basically mock the supposed hauntings taking place here, and the scene with the two of them pretending to investigate a real haunting only to hide under the sheets and rise like a ghost was the breaking point for me- the Innkeepers HAS to be 2 stars.  If you're going to mock horror *in* a supposed horror movie, you're going to fail miserably.  Simple as that.<br /><br />The little bit of blood and suspense during the final 10 minutes isn't the least bit frightening either.  The surprise at the end *is* pretty good at least.  Unfortunately by that point, you have to sit through over 80 minutes of boring, plotless nonsense so overall it really is a dud of a film.  Avoid.

0143119680|2.0|This book started out really great. I was intrigued by the main character (Diana, a brainy, driven professor) and loved the setting (the academic world of Oxford). I was curious about Diana's lineage (although I thought being a Bishop of the Salem Witch Trial Bishops was a little too obvious). Although I'm not usually a fan of fantasy or science fiction, I was even pulled in by the notion of an old book that only a certain person (certain witch in this case) seemed to be able to access. Things progressed quite well. . . and then it turned into a romance novel. Soon it seemed like all the historical parts of the story took a backseat to the will-they-or-won't they drama going on between Diana and her love interest. This rather cliche romance really dominated the last half to two thirds of the book and was waaaaay overdone. After a point it was pretty obvious that they were going to end up together for at least some period of time and really didn't need to be dwelled on any further. But it did.<br /><br />Really really disappointing finish to what I thought could have been a really interesting novel.

B007PS0DTI|3.0|The first Underworld was excellent, with dark imagery, a good story and strong direction.  All of the sequels have failed to be as good, including Awakening.  The plot was thin, and at the end of the movie I was thinking &#34;is that it?&#34;.  It seems to have been a setup for future movies.<br /><br />I really like the Underworld mythology, so I will watch any future movies they make, but I wish they could re-capture the essence and originality of the first movie.

Reason:  It is full of bugs.<br /><br />On the Kindle HD Fire:  it reboots about every 20 minutes or so,  taking you back to the start screen,  and I found one screen where I had to go into options and change the aspect ratio before I could complete the puzzle (The record piece on the right side of the screen).<br /><br />On the Xoom,  it caused lockups requiring a hard reboot.

B004EPZ07K|3.0|With the large number of comic book hero movies being produced, this one doesn't stand out as anything special. It isn't necessarily terrible, just terribly unremarkable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Let me just say that I was a big fan of the first temple run and thought it was a lot of fun. I was skeptical of a second game with the same concept. However I was very pleasantly surprised when I played it! They really added a lot! The scenery is very nice and the new obstacles and paths are really a lot of fun. I especially like the zip lines and mine cars, very creative. I also like the addition of abilities. I like that I can actually do something when my meter fills up all the way! All of that being said, I don't think that the difficulty level is quite on par with the first temple run. I've more than quadrupled my high score from the first game to this one (to be fair that may have more to do with the boost ability and gems for save me's, but still). All in all though it is an excellent  game, very exciting, and a lot of fun to play. I would definetely recommend this game, especially to anyone who enjoyed the first temple run!

0307950689|2.0|I was fascinated by this novel, even though it seemed a bit.. shallow? compared to others. It sounded like a lot of James Bond ideas thrown into a small idea that Dan Brown had... rather than a deeply thought out and written novel. But I pushed through, and then... the ending. The term.. cop out... comes to mind. My advice would be 'if you get stuck at the ending when writing a novel, give it a rest, finish it later... don't just whip out whatever pops up first and shove it into place'.<br /><br />Love the author, just not this novel. I'll go reread the earlier ones to make me feel better.

B000002LEE|3.0|Pros: Innovative, different sounds<br />Cons: Not what I was looking for :)<br /><br />To be honest, I heard \\"The Mountain Song\\" on a local alternative rock radio station, and swore up and down it was Judas Priest. I had heard Jane's Addiction before, and owned \\"Ritual De Lo Habitual\\", but they never sounded like this to me. It was heavy, it was metal sounding. I liked it. So, I went out and picked up the album, and was prepared for a huge dissapointment. Not because the album is bad, per se, but because I had hoped it was all going to sound like \\"The Mountain Song\\", which it does not. Jane's Addiction really are punk/alternative pioneers, and I sometimes like to group them with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. They experimented alot, and really did avoiding falling into a music label trap, which has to be commended. However, like the Chili Peppers, the music was very hit and miss. Some of it was good, some of it was terrible, depending on your individual tastes. So all in all, not being a \\"Punk\\" fanatic, I can't reccomend this album to people looking for hard rock. But on that same token, I am not qualified to give it a \\"don't get\\" review, because in it's own realm, it could be a great album.<br /><br />NOTE - Written: Oct 25 '99

B007QDNKQA|5.0|Movie moves fast and keeps ones attention.  Good story line.  The selection of actors in this film was excellent.  Thumbs up!
B000002H2H|5.0|Pros: Slightly more refined, great songwriting. One of the most influential metal albums ever.<br />Cons: Nothing really.<br /><br />Metallica's debut - Kill 'em All - Really gave speed metal a foothold on the hard rock audience. No, they weren't the first - But they were certainly one of the best to incorporate the fast paced guitars and drums into a solid musical entity - and they were also one the first to really put some cohesive song structure to the speed metal elements.<br /><br />Then came 1984's Ride the Lightning - Which in its own way, was just as groundbreaking as their debut. The core elements were still there, but in just two short years, it sounded like Metallica had grown leaps and bounds. They were able to refine the raw energy, yet increasingly add more traditional elements which would give metal a sense of validity and music - not just noise.<br /><br />The songs themselves, in subject matter and lyrically, expanded to a different age as well. Ride the Lightning would become a template for the next two Metallica releases, and still stands today as one of the most influential releases in metal's history - and is still a classic.<br /><br />Here's the song breakdown - 8 tracks:<br /><br />1. Fight Fire with Fire 2. Ride the Lightning 3. For Whom the Bell Tolls 4. Fade to Black 5. Trapped Under Ice 6. Escape 7. Creeping Death 8. The Call of Ktulu<br /><br />\\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" is a solid track - but in an album of classics, it stands to be one of the weaker songs to be found. It also sounds most reminiscent of Kill 'em All.<br /><br />The title track, \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is really where this bad boy takes off. It gave the distinct feeling of a song, a story, more than just some music with words added for no good reason. \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" - Stands to be a classic even today - It's slower, pulsing beat - accompanied with the stellar guitar work and memorable lyrics make it a classic.<br /><br />\\"Fade the Black\\" - Is probably the most influential song on the release. It proved that metal, as much as any genre, could evoke a wide variety of emotions. It was slower - more musical. Very traditional and folky, if the electric guitars were taken out. The song's dark subject (Suicide), as well as it's beautiful composition and emotion driven vocals - Helped to make it an anthem for metal teens.<br /><br />\\"Trapped Under Ice\\" is perhaps the only real blemish on the release. It is, by far, the most unremarkable of the songs. It isn't a bad song, just wholly unmemorable, in my view, stuffed between metal classics. \\"Escape\\" Follows - and is the most under rated cut on the release. It is very catchy musically, and its theme helps bring out the conept of the album.<br /><br />\\"Creeping Death\\" is my favorite song on Ride the Lightning - It is a metal epic - It pretty much represents everything good about metal. It was fast, powerful, musical, intelligent and dark. Its subject showed that rockers weren't dumb (Iron Maiden would do much to help that cause as well) and could be as booksmart or historically informed as anyone else.<br /><br />\\"The Call of Ktulu\\" continued the trend of one instrumental per Metallica album - And I feel is the best of them all. Certainly spooky, yet musical enough to help you get lost in the music. It makes a great album ender, and a nice follow up to \\"Creeping Death\\".<br /><br />Ride the Lightning may not be Metallica's best album (I'd give that honor to Master of Puppets) - But it was so experimental and influential, that it perhaps might be a more important one. It is also clearly the mold from which Master and the follow up And Justice for All would be cut from.<br /><br />5 out of the 8 songs are bonafide metal classics and also stand to be some of Metallica's finest work. Metalheads of all walks, as well as Metallibangers should all have this in their collections.<br /><br />NOTE: This review was written on 12/11/00.
B008602KQI|5.0|A great movie! The herky-jerky style of the movie can be irksome, but it works well when the killing starts.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It is a fast read because you want to know what happens next. Shocking twists keep it interesting.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Lontg, but every turn of the page has a new surprise...both good or bad. Stirs tghe imagination and tugs at the heart.  Great series. Look forward to reading #5.
B000000WCV|3.0|Pros: Couple of good dancin' tunes<br />Cons: Those two songs are the only highlights. :)<br /><br />It's hard to believe this album is only two years old, it seems much longer ago, that I was strolling around some Montreal dance clubs jammin to \\"Around the World\\". Which, although popular, is not as good of a track as \\"Da Funk\\" on the album, but both contain some great grooves and are impossible to hear and not move your feet too. However, those are basically the two main highlights of the album. Some of the stuff gets slower and a little less listenable, but more than anything else, it gets boring. If you are into dance and groove music, you will want to add \\"Da Funk\\" and \\"Around the World\\" to your collections, but the rest of the album is definately optional.<br /><br />NOTE -  Written: Oct 25 '99
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I bought this mic to use for portraits/ interview videos where the cable isn't a problem. I've used the well-known Sennheiser wireless system before but wasn't convinced with the sound quality (voice sounded too nasal) while this cheap mic sounded full and almost too loud.

1619695006|2.0|I was really disappointed in the book.if in england maybe, but i am not in the uk, go back to the harry potter series and pick up with the families, much better.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|An entertaining tale that in no way made me feel like a geek, dork or dweeb, but rather a nostalgic old fool that missed the 80's and his teens all at the same time.
B0002EXH5E|2.0|Pros: Prince of Darkness, ray of light. :)<br />Cons: Everything else, just about.<br /><br />It seems everyone is changing their sound to fit it. Metal pioneers Megadeth led by Dave Mustaine, for years had been trying something different, and now they have gone to the mainstream. Their latest release \\"Risk\\" adds electronic/industrial elements which seems to be the way all metal acts are going, and it is more than a little disappointing. There is one ray of hope on this album, \\"Prince of Darkness\\" relives the 80's metal glory days, and is a great song. But the other main release from the disc \\"Insomnia\\" gives me insomnia wondering how such a song could be made by metal gods like Megadeth. Oh well, all good things must come to an end, and Megadeths has been a ling time coming. Try to get your hands on \\"Prince of Darkness\\" though, it's 6 minutes of metal goodness.<br /><br />NOTE: This review was written Oct 12 '99
B00992CF6W|4.0|For example, you can't mine redstone, you can't mate chickens, sheep, or cows, you can't make a bucket, there are no under ground cave systems, it doesn't rain or snow (however depending on the seed you can see snow on the ground), the nether is very short and boring and your left over with a huge tower of netherrack, and lastly there are no enderman so no ended portal either. I like the game just if it had more of these, I would play more.
B00AV68GOA|5.0|I was so excited to see that this book had come out.  I love the series and was looking forward to reading the scripts.  These are the expanded versions - so there are some added extra scenes and dialogue.  There is also some great commentary by the writer that explains certain scenes, character decisions, and historical facts.  It also describes the scenes and characters.  It is really fun to see what the original thought was behind the episodes that I love so much.  I got the kindle version and it is great.  I can't wait for the other 2 seasons to come out.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves the show.  It is also a great way to ease the withdrawl symptoms one has as they finish up a season and have to wait for the next one to come on!!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Ever since I saw the series several years ago I thought this was the most realist. I have loaned it out several times.
B000000993|4.0|Pros: Interesting, Dark, Good musically<br />Cons: None really<br /><br />Grungy/Goth masters Tool debut release was... Well, interesting at the very least. The sound was relatively original, and it had a good enough variety of hard driving music as well as the slower, sadder music to make it an interesting listen. The popular track \\"Sober\\" may be the best on the album, but \\"intolerance\\" is extremely good as well. Avoid looking at the nasty pictures in the booklet, but enjoy the music. Not suited for children, the lyrics contain strong adult content. This album is all about angst, fetishes, and the dark underside of teens and twentysomethings. It can be self revealing, or disgusting, but no matter what, the music is good.<br /><br />NOTE - Written: Oct 12 '99
B00ATPVA78|3.0|This wasn't the best hidden object games<br /><br />IT was<br /><br />There was to much talking and much game I feel it wasn't worth the price.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The Wimpy Kid series is a great series to read.  The kids really enjoy them !!  Would recommend them to all kids.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The ability to choose and blend these soothing sounds is very unique! My son's take turns choosing the sounds for bedtime, and it helps calm them right to sleep....Love this app!!!
B000002H97|3.0|Pros: Last decent Metallica album, still musical and heavy<br />Cons: I smell change in the air...<br /><br />If I had reviewed this album when I first got it almost a decade ago, I would have said how much I hated it. But now, after hearing what Metallica puts out now, this album truly is the end of a metal era, and should be treated as such. You could hear the changes coming in the songs like \\"Sad but true\\", but some of that classic Metallica remained in tracks like \\"The God that Failed\\" and \\"Of Wolf and Man\\". I appreciate this album more today than I did when it was new, but it is still a far cry of the Metallica of old. You are better off with pre-\\"the black album\\" releases from this metal group. But it isn't a bad addition to any collection either.<br /><br />NOTE: Review written Oct 12 '99
B000ZELISO|5.0|We love watching this movie!  Also love the special features!  We love reading all the books, too!  :)  Great movie!
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I have wanted this movie for so long ever since I first saw it at the theatre.  I watch it on the average of 2 to 3 times a day....Thanks
B00338QENI|4.0|Nice prose. Great scientific detail. Very thoughtful effort - very tearful scenes. Thorough treatment of a sensitive topic. Loved the careful interweaving of the autobiography.<br /><br />Four and a half stars - Wanders too much in to advocacy in the later chapters.
B000000XB9|5.0|Pros: Some of the best rock ever, perfect to drive to.<br />Cons: Nothing<br /><br />Ah - Creedence Clearwater Revival - one of the greatest bands to drive to ever. And what better way to cruise along to all your favorite swamp rock hits, than with their greatest hits collection, Chronicle, which boasts 20 of the best of their tunes.<br /><br />Creedence Clearwater Revival is the essential blues based rock band. Mixing country, R&B and Rock into one smooth package - it is what rock was meant to be in the beginning, with just a touch of bayou flavor. (Though the Fogerty's were from Cali, not Louisiana)<br /><br />At the time of its release in 1976 - Chronicle (Vol. 1) contained all of CCR's hit songs - including their version of \\"I Heard it Through The Grapevine\\". The single version was becoming a hit at the time - though the CD version contains the whopping 11 minute epic of groove rock.<br /><br />Why do I love CCR? When I was a kid taking road trips with my pop in Upstate New York - We'd jam in the truck. Listening to the CB with tunes from The Doors, Floyd, and CCR cranking out of the tape deck. It was a kids dream, and the tunes were so good to ride to, they became excellent driving tunes when it was my turn. It's essential road trip music.<br /><br />For the casual fan, this is all the CCR you'll ever need. For the more demanding critic, you will find this a more than ample collection of the best of Creedance. Here's the track listing:<br /><br />1. Susie Q 2. I Put a Spell on You 3. Proud Mary 4. Bad Moon Rising 5. Lodi 6. Green River 7. Commotion 8. Down on the Corner 9. Fortunate Son 10. Travelin' Band 11. Who'll Stop the Rain 12. Up Around the Bend 13. Run Through the Jungle 14. Lookin' Out My Back Door 15. Long as I can See the Light 16. I Heard it Through the Grapevine 17. Have you Ever Seen the Rain 18. Tonight 19. Sweet Hitch-Hiker 20. Someday Never Comes<br /><br />While you may be familiar with most of these songs - I'll tell you some of the reasons this is such an incredible collection. One of the things I like the most is how it runs the gamut of styles - you get straight out rock, some groove, and of course some of the slower ballad style songs - it gives CCR more than enough variety to prevent boredom from setting in. One of the amazing things is that the songs actually seemed to be grouped according to style.<br /><br />\\"Susie Q\\" is probably one the songs that best represents the CCR sound - and it starts of the compilation. It's got a groove, a rock beat and plenty of soul to vocals with some nice pickin' on the six string. \\"I Put a Spell On You\\" is done with the country side up, but somehow manages to sound spooky.<br /><br />From here, I feel the compilation really kicks into high gear with \\"Proud Mary\\", \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" and \\"Lodi\\", three of CCR's best tunes. All three really have a similar sound, just done at different tempos, of course \\"Lodi\\" the sad and slower one.<br /><br />Creedence almost moves into the next phase with a little more of the swamp rock. \\"Green River\\", \\"Commotion\\" and \\"Down on the Corner\\" all have more of that southern rock grit to it. \\"Down on the Corner\\" is one of my favorite CCR tunes, it is almost impossible not to sing along to.<br /><br />\\"Fortunate Son\\" and \\"Travellin' Band\\" are serious rock tunes, and while \\"Fortunate Son\\" probably won't ever get the protest recognition as Barry McGuire's \\"Eve of Destruction\\" or Buffalo Springfield's \\"For What it's Worth\\" - The song really does have a strong message.<br /><br />As almost an intermission, you get the first slower melody with \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\". The vocal harmonies are impressive, and the song does a great job of changing your mood a bit. But quickly it's brought back up with more swamp rock. \\"Up around the Bend\\" may not be best remembered for it's through provoking lyrics, though it to is extremely catchy and easy to sing along to.<br /><br />\\"Run Through The Jungle\\" is similar in many ways to \\"Susie Q\\". It has a nice groove it with the rock beat. However the subject is clearly darker, and something not normally hard from Fogerty. But that darkness is the main thing that makes this tune one of their best, and makes it stick out from the pack.<br /><br />\\"Looking out my Back Door\\" dishes heavy into the country flavor, it's got a twang, and seriously country tinged lyrics, and again a simple lyric flow that is easy to sing along to. \\"Long as I can See the Light\\" is one of CCR's best ballads, better than both \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\" and \\"Have you ever Seen the Rain?\\" in my mind. It's sad yet uplifting all at the same time, a song about life's changes and transitions.<br /><br />People have many different opinions about \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\\", depending on whose version of it you like better, or in CCR's case, whether you prefer the short or long. On the CD, you'll get the long version, which I actually prefer. Sure it kinda breaks the flow of the disc and almost goes into another dimension, but I love it. Really, I think CCR was perfect for \\"Grapevine\\". The two were made for eachother, and it is one of their finest.<br /><br />\\"Have you Ever Seen the Rain?\\" is a strong ballad. I personally like \\"Long as I...\\" better, but their are strong arguments for both. And by no means do I mean to imply this is a bad song. The music I like, and most of the vocals I like, but I was just never crazy about the refrain.<br /><br />\\"Hey Tonight\\" and \\"Sweet Hitch-Hiker\\" follow, and though they were hits, and I sing along to them both, they are the closest to \\"disposable\\" cuts I think one would find on this compilation. Both are fairly standard rock tunes, but there are better to be found.<br /><br />\\"Someday Never Comes\\", however, is perhaps my favorite CCR tune of all time, and it fittingly closes out this compilation. Maybe it has something to do with my own childhood, or the subject in general, or maybe it is just that amazing of a song. But I love everything about it, the message, the music, the words, everything. It is a powerful and great tune.<br /><br />Yum, CCR. Chronicle, 20 of their very best. I would recommend this to any rock/southern rock fans, and remember it next time you're taking that long trip. You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />\\"You better learn him fast, you better him young... Cause someday never comes...\\"<br /><br />NOTE: This review was written 1/4/01
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|Emma, Rupert, and Daniel are so cute!  They did a great job with their characters!  We love watching this movie!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|'Nuff said. It is my favorite for a reason! Loved the story line, and the ending totally surprised me. I'd recommend it to all of my friends and everyone else.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent. Now we need to get Patrick back into the action through non other than Edith and her work to reach out to WWI veterans. Let's see if everyone can work together to save Downton.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Perfect gift for someone special who loves Star Wars. The stores only seem to have Blu-ray now.<br />just what we wanted.
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|We enjoyed this movie!  The dementors were scary looking!  I love when Harry produces his expecto patronus!!  We are also introduced to his father's friends!  Great movie!
0938045768|5.0|I would recommend this product to all athletes, young adults, not-so-young adults, people new to exercise, and even seasoned and highly trained athletes. This book takes body weight training to a whole new level. You WILL develop superior control over your body and unheard of feats of strength. However, this book starts at the very basics and can be used by anyone with almost no equipment. This program can even heal old lifting injuries. Our track team's ab workouts are a walk in the park compared to this hardcore prison-style training. Worth every penny.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I watched this movie because my grandchildren told me about it.  I really enjoyed the movie and the style of filming the story/
B008XBCJ34|4.0|This is the gold standard for a visually entertaining movie.  The story line is so-so, but the film still entertains because of the visual presentation.  Would have given it 5 stars, but story is just okay.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Love this adventure movie!!  We have all the Harry Potter movies and books!  This movie is fun to watch and gets you ready for the end of You Know Who!!!  :)
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book was hard to put down and I enjoyed reading it.<br />Some parts are not suitable for kids under twelve though.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|For those of you who, like myself, have already followed the television series on ABC family for quite a while and are curious whether the plots are consistent with one another, Sara Shepard doesn't disappoint. Yes, the two story lines are very, very different, and the book advances much faster than the tv series, but it is still entertaining and interesting to read.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This was one of the first \\"building\\" apps I downloaded for my kindle fire hd. Graphics and art are nice. Sometimes takes a little long to load. Like another reviewer said, it needs improvement in money and food management as it can get frustrating pretty fast when quests require major resources to complete.<br /><br />It is a decent game, but requires a lot of patience...or spend real money.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|We enjoyed this movie so much!!  All the actors and actresses did a wonderful job in the last movie!  Loved watching Rupert, Emma, and Daniel grow up over the years making all these movies!  They made the characters come to life!!
B008M721MS|5.0|Skype is a very cool app I think it's a great app. Love the clarity and ease of use. Would recommend to friends
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's definitely difficult to review this in over twenty words.  What can you say about a calculator that does everything you want and nothing you don't?  A calculator that is easy to use, shows your work, and even saves your last equation needs few words after &quot;It works perfectly and I love it!&quot;<br /><br />I could compare it to other applications, but after downloading this one, there was no need to try another one.  If you want a basic calculator that does even more, then this one is the one that you need.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|One of the better building games.  I like the art and music is nice.  Money might be slow at first, but will come faster with later improvements.  I wish the social network wasn't solely based on Facebook though.
B000W10AEI|5.0|Love the actors and actresses!  They did a great job making this movie!  We loved reading the books and watching the movies!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Because I feel they are tops. I like all their songs and play their CD's  every day.<br />Wish I could see them in concert!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I thought this might be a good game for my granddaughter and the graphics are beautiful but the horse just jumps around and does a few spins and thats about it. Boring even for a 4 year old.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show that keeps you coming back for more. Not just about zombies, but more about how communities form and human interaction in a time of total chaos! Woud recommend to anyone... Well assuming you don't mind a little gore!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just couldn't stop reading.  And when I had to, was so excited to get back to it.  Interesting also were the so many twists during the whole story.  Characters you thought were heroes/ heroines who would live until the end of the book would one by one die on you.  And you would read the story from the angle of the dying character... dying with them.
B00AIA89HS|5.0|Hatebreed does it again. The songs and lyrics are great. Hatebreed keeps real metal alive. I have seen hatebreed live and they are amazing and this new songs will sound awesome live.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|This movie, along with all the others, is a very engaging movie....tons of action, and the FX are incredible.....<br />Good Times.....
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I love this movie, it was so entertaining since the beginning of the movie and throughout, it's a clean and funny movie, loved it!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is a funny, light hearted movie. It just goes to show you don't really know people you see every day. JosieBear1951
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Not what I expected.  This movie tries to give viewers a feel of Bourne movies but the only things it does is show movie clips from previous ones. The beginning of the movie is slow and predictable and once the whole plot comes &#34;into&#34; light you are left hanging.  This was like watching an episode of your favorite TV show and told to tune in next week to see what other crazy things may come up.  Renner and Weisz were good but not real chemistry between them.  It was funny to watch them at the end of the movie get all &#34;naughty&#34; with their cheesy lines!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|An incredible book about the most dynamic and magnanimous leader in US history. Lincoln was ahead of his time and Doris Kearns Goodwin eloquently captures his genius. This is the most well written book I have had the pleasure of reading.
