B00B2V66VS|5.0|my son downloaded this game for my daughter, they both found this game fun and easy to play. great game
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Definitely feel good entertainment. You like the characters. It is at times laugh out loud funny but also poignant. Highly recommended for a light read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my son downloaded this app for the kindle fire. he found it vey challenging and fun to play. great app
B008133MDK|5.0|This is a show you can wrap your head around!<br />Enjoy the intellectual banter.  If you are more into mental gymnastics than dumb & dumber, you will probably like this.
0743270754|5.0|had to re-read it after watching the movie...love all d k goodwin books...sorry i don't have anymore to say to you
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|One of the best movie with incredible effects and production design.<br />So touching. Movie is about real life experience and highlights one family's trauma.
B009RH973I|5.0|It is the best cover I have gotten for my Kindle fire, It is easy to hold or stand up to read or play games
0765316994|3.0|This book started out great.  Unfortunately the momentum and story-telling fell flat midway through.<br /><br />The idea of a story told from the perspective of soon-to-die Star Trek crew members is a great one and there are a number of amusing nods to the frequently pointed out illogical actions taken by the top brass in the TV series.  If Scalzi had followed through with that theme this would have been an excellent book.  Unfortunately, he pulls away and breaks the fourth wall, engaging in a sort of post-modern meta-story that falls flat and breaks the enjoyment of the initial setup.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was a very interesting read.  Sure was glad I had a medical background, so I was able to understand what Dr. Alexander wrote to correlate his NDE to his actual medical state at the time.  That made his experience even more believable.
B003JIPJRE|4.0|I had not realized that this film was indeed a sequel<br />to the animated series until I recently finally saw it.What a surprise!  Great follow-up to the animated series with the possible exception of the Joker sounding noticeably quite different than on the original series. But a great film nevertheless!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book is poorly written, the story is paper thin and hardly engaging. Please ignore the reviews that say the relationship is abusive if you are in the lifestyle, or have looked at all into the lifestyle you will see be disappointed by the depictions. Fifty is an interesting beginning of a character if he had been fleshed out some the story could have been much better BUT the sex scenes are interesting. That's the only reason to read these books
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|We enjoyed the movie and ordered it in HD. It kept reloading and would never load in HD.  During the movie it kept stopping and starting and finally when we had only 15 minutes left it totally stopped.  Nothing we did would make it start again.  We finally gave up and watched the ending on our IPad.  Very disappointed in Amazon streaming and we still had to pay for the HD.
1609611543|5.0|I was so impacted by this book that I decided to eliminate wheat and gluten from my diet. I have lost 44 pounds and counting. Plus my blood sugar has gone down from 158 to 111. I still have a lot of weight to loose but I know I will loose it this time.<br />I feel great!  This is the only time I've dieted and don't feel hungry. If yuou need to loose weight you should consider this reading this book.
0470185317|5.0|This review is more of messages to the Author and Editor. However, as practically everyone has mentioned, it is a VERY useful book to learn VHDL (I assume the author's Verilog edition is also great) and to use as a reference to common interfaces in the workplace (SRAM).<br /><br />I also have \\"RTL Hardware Design Using VHDL: Coding for Efficiency, Portability, and Scalability\\" by the same author. Yet another great resource in the workplace.<br /><br />My only complaint about both of these books - the index. The index is very brief. The index does not reference anywhere near enough keywords, etc.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|I really enjoy Mr. Nobody and I am going to watch again today with friends. I hope they enjoy it as much as I did myself.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait to start book 3!!!! So much more intriguing than Fifty shaded!!! If u loved Fifty you have to read this series. Thanks to my friend John for suggesting this read to me!!!
0553386794|5.0|Enjoying the book very much - I'm already well into the series on TV. Will be buying the next books soon
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Pixar has become Disneyfied lately (sigh) but this movie surprised me. I loved the central characters, the story was heart warming, and the animation was excellent.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|A funny, exhilarating, heart-breaking story of friendship, tragedy, love, and families in crises ... some we can comprehend and others in places where our minds cannot bear to go.  A story you won't forget.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|My son loved it and now is completely hooked to the series. He wants to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie diary next!!
B000W91RUG|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is a great TV series, and received the series  in excellent shape. And received the product ahead of schedule.
B00081912E|5.0|This movie is a great movie to warch and it works great as well. Arrived as described and in good working order.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really liked this book. I feel so sad about his death. Chris was a special person who still had a job to do. I hope someone is carrying on with his foundation. God bless the USA and all our military keeping us safe.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|This movie seemed to be a lack luster effort to reflect upon the trials and tribulations of parents with children at 40. Although the parenting issues were well done, as they are universal, there is no real sense of understanding of the financial difficulty and the social-economic reality for the majority of Americans who struggle to make ends meet.  Therefore, this movie comes across as out of touch and slightly insulting.  Overall this movie was a major disappointment, and what's worse, I now I have to screen Apatow movies before I view them instead of taking on faith they will always be great. I wish I never watched this movie.
B00BCZUAE8|4.0|I'm not fan of JT. However, there is 3 song on the albem which are very good. I do like &#34;Mirror:&#34;
1742200508|5.0|This is a comprehensive guide book for traveling in England. In addition to the obvious location-specific listings, this includes:<br /><br />Good:<br />- Top 20 experiences in England (mostly places to visit, but also \\"Afternoon Tea\\" and \\"Walking in England\\")<br />- Interest-specific (sports, cathedrals, the outdoors, etc.) lists of destinations<br />- Multi-day itineraries of various lengths<br /><br />Bad:<br />- None to speak of.<br /><br />Though their coverage is not identical, this title compares rather favorably with several other recently published guides I have (for London, Great Britain, etc.).
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was one of the worst books I've read in many many years. Skipped to the end in case something interesting happened. Worse than a bore- irritating
B00AJAFNIA|3.0|It's really fun just the crab is in possible to get passed when it goes up it just spews up like a bird
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|You must see this movie, is very beautiful! Many people are saying that it is &#34;slow&#34;, but the tempo of this important moment in the entire history of the United States of America has to be put in the cinema like that, &#34;slow&#34;, so you can understand the &#34;GREAT PROBLEMS IN THAT MOMENT OF HISTORY&#34;, there were two countries in one continent, the Union was going to desapere, and the most important problem in that moment, &#34;THE SLAVERY, THAT ALL MEN ARE EQUALS&#34;! You can't have the &#34;same tempo of the movie Argo&#34; because the situation was different. For me, the movie is great, &#34;GOD BLESS ABRAHAM LINCOLN! Arthur.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is ok but I would like to see more interaction with the game as far as citizens in the city maybe give them jobs that you can sign them
B006LSZECO|3.0|Starts out well but the last third of the book is rather contrived and the ending is terrible. Idea for the style was great but just didn't hit the mark. C+ or B-.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I saw this movie at the movie theater twice.  I enjoyed it both times.  I could hardly wait until until it came out on DVD.  Sally Field played an incredible Mary Lincoln.  Daniel Day Lewis became Abraham Lincoln. Great movie.
B00BIVN82M|1.0|I so do not like this album.  Kind of shocked.  Who helped him select these song anyway? I have all his albums and frankly I don't even want one single from this CD.  Such a waste of talent.
B004LP3AYI|1.0|having read the first novel was excited to start the second book in this series. Ready to buy in the store for my kindle. Except book 2 is currently unavailable ...... What?! Why. Seems easier to download then buy from amazon???
0375413405|5.0|I bought this book on line for about half the amount of money the bookstores were selling it for.  I bought it right after I watched the movie Julie Julia and promptly make a few things.  The recipes are a bit tedious but worth every single minute.  I made a chicken dish for my girlfriend and she about freaked out when she tasted it.  She has been a vegetarian for a long time and loved it.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Fabulous series. Nothing like anything I have read before just when you think you know what's going to happen the key roles are changed dramatically. Can't wait to read more. If you are not reading the books you are thinking about them.<br />Shezzah
B000065KH4|5.0|A terrific love story; definitely a chick flick and worth watching more than once.  Johnny Depp is yummy in this movie.
B0087ITBPC|1.0|I was looking forward to a Streisand movie, after 10 min. I turned it off...  Very disappointing...  Perhaps it was the combination of the actors?  Not worth the time wasted to watch the movie.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|The entire album is well written, and is a whole album, not just different songs mashed into each other. The singles are great, but there are a few good acoustic songs as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing for me and my daughter she absolutely loved it the fact that it was so realistic it made her start writing she now LOVES to write realistic fiction. THANKS SO MUCH.
B009MO57H6|5.0|The plot and story are much more put together than, and the end leaves you salivating for the end of the series
B004C3DLJS|5.0|My son loves all the Toy Story movies but the 3rd seems to be his favorite. He loves Spanish Buzz the best!
007174889X|5.0|Unquestionable value for those in the Medical field - this will solve 90% of your doubts in learning... just try it !
B0091REZMW|3.0|it force closes frequently, those on my friends list when i try to send them a gift it says cannot send not a friend. after certain levels you have to use diamonds or other things before exploring the rooms.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Her story is such an inspiration. All the songs are good, but, of course, &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; is outstanding, especially for those who watched her appearance on her first TV show in Great Britain.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|both cds did not work!  very disappointing!  i think what i wrote is plenty...but site telling me i didnt write enough!
0385535147|1.0|The author's writing is losing a lot of its depth in that the plot/story conflicts don't continue to build until the climax is reached -- there are lengthy flat spots along the way that really serve no purpose other than filling pages with words.  It will be quite some time before I pick up another Grisham book.
B000FC1HQY|5.0|There are some books you know you will never forget.  This is one of them.  The vulnerability of people, what those crazy parents were doing to their children, and the political setting in Africa are all just unforgettable.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|We enjoyed this movie. There was action and a story behind it. Good all the way through. Glad we rented it!
B001DJLCPE|5.0|Great classic movie.....Peter Sellers died too young.....recommended.....George C. Scott (holy cow !!!!!!!!)  Slim Pickens-to see it is to believe it.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Predictable, but entertaining.  De Niro was just walking through the script.  Charicatures rather than life like characters.  Not anywhere near the competition.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|My 1st grade son loves this series.  We are currently reading book 3 and he was really excited when we rented this movie.  It was exciting for him to see the words come to life.
B008D30K7E|4.0|I loved this book for its tongue in cheek moments and unexpected turns. I'd recommend it to absolutely anyone, especially those that enjoy a good giggle.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|AWESOME, THE WHOLE SERIES AND SEASONS A MUST SEE. ive watched from season one to last season. definitely a must see
1439153663|2.0|If you must read this book, may I suggest a drinking game?  Every time the author refers to something as \\"the liquid,\\" whether it be a restorative chicken broth, laudanum-laced peach brandy, or claret on the dinner table, take a drink of a liquid of your own choosing.  Soon, you may be inebriated enough not to notice that every single black slave in this book is a pure hearted, innocent angel, while every single villainous, repulsive character is a white man.<br /><br />Of course there are some kind and generous white men in this book as well.  I counted exactly two.  The rest of the white male characters include a pedophile tutor, a disgusting overseer who fathers one mulatto child after another, and a young man who I suppose we can't blame for becoming a rapist because he was the one who was molested by the tutor. Oh and let's not forget the distant and neglectful captain, the owner of the plantation where his lack of supervision is what allows all of these travesties to occur.<br /><br />The white women, on the other hand, are portrayed as helpless victims whose only recourse is drug addiction.  They are not only helpless, but clueless.  None of them ever seem to know what's going on right in front of their cute little noses! I realize that times were tough back then if you were a woman.  But I refuse to believe that they were as lacking in resources as the women in this book seem to be.<br /><br />It's obvious that this author was heavily influenced by writers like Bronte and Austen.  I mean, we even have a scene at the end of the book (SPOILER ALERT) involving the burning down of a mansion containing a mad woman.  The main character becomes engaged to not just one, but two of the wrong suitors!  There are missed communications a-plenty.<br /><br />I kept reading because I wanted to see what would happen.  And I'm giving this book two stars, because I think some may enjoy it.  It certainly isn't a challenging read.  And some of the characters are actually prettylovable.  Just take my advice and keep a tall glass of some sort of liquid close at hand.
B0049J0CTM|2.0|is is my 7 yr old son favorite movie. being that im a prime member  I wish it were free because everytime he wants to watch it I have to rent it for couple of days. I became prime because  I wanted my kids to be able to watch old movies with out renting them. I am thinking about just ordering the movie from a local store. it will save me money in the long run.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I bought this CD to listen to her new songs prior to seeing her in concert. The CD is great and her concert was fabulous. She crosses over so many genres of music that it makes her concerts enjoyable for wide variety of people. Also, her humor and dialog keeps the show so entertaining.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|The book overall was great but the ending was sort of a cop out. I mean who survived and who didn't? I guess we will never know....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very good quality,high resolution and easy to access.  The extra features were a unexpected surprise and have been very enjoyable.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app never updates 0,6 the update never was released this app never updates and it gets boring after a while
B0019GO5DC|4.0|I remember this movie from watching it on tv a while ago.<br />I  had to have it and luckily it was on dvd; so I had to buy it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|What a well done app! Interesting and fun! The creators are brilliant! Would recommend to anyone!! Try it for many hours of fun.
B00000331V|5.0|great songs from a great bar (live) band. Recommend it to all that like the band and to have a good time.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I thought S4 would get bogged down after the first two episodes but then the writing gained a notch leading to a season finale that was orchestrated to a phenomenal level of plot density and character detail.  For television, a unique display of talent all around.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Fantastic book and a must for anyone that appreciates the military, war, etc. You should take the time to read this.
B002BBJ52U|1.0|If you love romantic comedies in the vein of Sabrina or While You Were Sleeping or Notting Hill, RUN don't walk from this movie. After about 1/2 hour, I realized that these were all awful people who deserved to be miserable and alone.  All alone.  Even without me.  So I turned it off.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Avoided watching this movie all this time only because it had a stupid title. Don't judge a book because of it's cover, right? Wow! I was SO surprised! I haven't laughed out loud so much with a movie in a long, long time. Great story and Emma Stone was astounding. And I loved all the 80's movie references.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|It works great on both iOS (iPad) and Android (Galaxy S3).  A bit pricy, but if you wait long enough you can probably grab it for ~$5 like I did.
B003QSPO9K|5.0|An amazing movie with true stories mixed with a little Hollywood. Tons of action and romance. Movie for all demographics. A must see.
B005IS565S|5.0|this is a very great album by Ffdp after listening to it youll be shocked and it simply kicks ass
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Very nice heart-warming movie. Leaves you with a good feeling after watching it. Great acting by the actors and actresses. I would highly recommend it.
B00AFYZDL2|4.0|I have been listening to Saxon for about 10 years now, after seeing them live at Bloodstock 2003 and being completely blown away by their performance and their excellent songwriting.  I gradually collected many of their albums over the years, and really looked forward to their last 4-5 releases as they came out.  The 2000s have been a bit of a mixed bag in my opinion, with certainly more good than bad.  But with the release of Call To Arms, it sounded like Saxon were going back to more of a rock feel (I for one have liked their foray into heavier material) and their songwriting was getting a bit weaker.  I certainly didn't play it as much as their previous release, Into the Labyrinth.<br /><br />Well, in comes metal producer Andy Sneap and a fresh set of 10 tracks, and suddenly we have Saxon producing their finest record since Lionheart.  The riffs are fantastic, the choruses are soaring and catchy, and the writing in general is just very strong.  The instrumentation is also fantastic.  The guitars are fresh sounding, the solos are unique and the drums are absolutely thundering, but not overdone where they take over the mix.  I'm convinced that if you put a song like Warriors Of The Road on US rock radio and didn't say what band it was, it would catch on.  This stuff is so much better than the generic drivel I tend to hear on the FM dial.<br /><br />The first 5 tracks after the initial \\"Procession\\" are the best of the bunch, and make me just want to jump in the car and hit the gas!  I suggest you do the same and head over to the record store to pick this up.  Or just order it here : )<br /><br />The bonus disc of new, different versions of older tracks was also more interesting than I thought it would be.  Requiem was a great fit for an acoustic version.  Thanks to the Saxon guys for another album that I'll be spinning for years.  And please come back to the US!  The 2011 tour was the best time I've had at a show in a while.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Wow, love this one.  I'm always looking fo a quick casual game to play in waiting rooms, etc.  This is simple to pick up and interesting enough to make time pass quickly.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Every single song in the album has a deep message. In a few you want to dance, in a few you can see Ke$ha's signature: giving the finger to the haters, ans the others talk about love. You won't regret buying Warrior.
B007SGM084|5.0|I would recommend the fifty shades trilogy to anyone that enjoys these kinds of books as I have.<br /><br />Very good books!
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|and the behind the seens love triangle and a half along withe the rise of the brownshirts popularity is a history lesson I will not forget, it`s happening in America right nowand will soon be interrupted by the return the christ people will believe in the lies spewing out of his mouth because they hav`t been taught the simplicity that the true CHRIST wants you to know and act on
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was raised as a Methodist, but don't go to church as an adult. I do believe in a higher power, a God, a heaven; and this book is proof that there is. It gives me hope, peace & it does scare me a little knowing that it's not an easy road (just as life isn't easy sometimes) but it's worth it when you get to that special place.
B00CMO5H8W|4.0|I watched it because  Katey Sagal played in it  but she was only  in there for like 2secs so yeah but the episode was ok and I just gave it four stars
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Along the lines of presumed innocent this book grabs your attention and keeps you reading throughout the night lots of holding your breath waiting to see what happens next
B00005RDRO|5.0|We started watching this film when the kids were under 5 years old.  Except for 2 &#34;language&#34; incidents, the comedy is superb and the cast is the best. We quote lines from this film all the time and probably have the entire script memorized.  It can be watched multiple times and the lines are still hilarious. Everyone should view this film.
B0016BP0PW|4.0|If you are a Beatles fan you will enjoy the music. It is a live story from 2 different world. The story plot is cute but the music is really what gets my attention.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Listen to the album almost every day.  I think of my own life and losses when I do.  I like his voice.
1400032717|5.0|I'm not reviewing the contents of the book - that has been done many times before, and by better writers / reviewers than me. This is a decently bound paperback with reasonable quality covers which will survive many (re)readings, heavy annotation, and inhabiting bedroom floors, backpacks and back seats of cars. I'm happy with my purchase.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Listen to it almost every day, and am still enjoying it.  Attended Dylan's show in April at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA and have to say, he's an old guy but he's still rocking.
B006699DDE|4.0|I confess to reading Treasure Island in preparation for a new television series coming soon called Black Sails. It will be a prequel based on the characters in this book, in particular, Captain Flint, who is already dead as this story begins. The storytelling holds up with larger-than-life characters outwitted by Jim, a brave boy who inspired us all in our youth to take a chance. A classic adventure tale/ coming-of-age story well-told. I read it on my Kindle and feared the illustrations would be too small to enjoy but not the case.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I would recommend this product to any fan of the 10th doctor. It's great to play with, and the pen really works. I take it with me everywhere, and it's quite sturdy, The only part I have a problem with is having to twist to get the cap off of the pen, but you get accustomed to it quickly. The sound effect and light is great, really fun to pretend with.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It is easily the best game that you can get if you are a person that likes games like grand theft auto, the only difference is Gangstar is much better.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have never played this game before and my daughter highly recommended it to me....OMG very addictive.  I can't wait to get better at it.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Very nice film adaptation where Jennifer Lawrence - who is one of the most talented and likable actresses in a generation - flexes her acting skills, and Cooper hits the mark as a slightly mad, somewhat bruised protagonist.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game and so happy it comes free! Also happy you can play it without wifi. Now time to get more Angry Bird Games.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|It may be cliche to say but \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a triumph of the human spirit.  There are dual themes running here.  The first is falling down a ditch and clawing your way out of it.  Secondly it's about two bent but not broken hearts who are desperately right for one another and the awkward path they take in coming to that realization.  Mental illness is a tricky theme to portray but writer-director David O. Russell in conjunction with his main actors, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, pull it off beautifully with sensitivity and great wit and insight.  Cooper and Lawrence should be applauded for getting the tone right for their characters and not overplaying it.  We forget we are watching actors giving a performance but people like us trying to cope with the slings and arrows that burden us.  Last year was a terrific year for American film.  In a perfect world Cooper wouldn't have had to compete with Daniel Day-Lewis' magestical turn in \\"Lincoln\\".  \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is without a doubt at the head of last year's class.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book was not at all what I expected. Very sad, happy, and clever book.  The even though the ending was quite predictable, I still enjoyed getting to it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this game is so fun worth the seven buck great graphics epic gameplay and great multiplayer and campaign rate it 5 stars
B009AMANBA|3.0|Not as good as I expected. Dragged frequently with lots of dialogue. Was interesting view of the political wrangling back and forth which never seems to change from then to now.
1451695187|5.0|Wonderful true story of a NDE. Another life changing experience that can change many peoples beliefs without any references to<br />to specific religions. A powerful book.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I really like  this notebook because i can have it on my kindle so supper cool i can finally stop walking around with a lot of books,with the notebooks i can put all my todo list and reminder.Supper cool and they are free.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Still trying to solve this mystery would like to know. But love the show and the actors!!!! Cannot wait for more
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Being a child of this era, I really liked the story.  He must have done extensive research into the Kennedy &#34;saga&#34;.  Was wondering how he would end it and I wasn't disappointed.  Might even read it again and again.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|Such an honest and thoughtful book.  It made me think about our reactions to death and grieving and the reflections and marks loss can leave on our lives.  It is a very positive book about how it is possible to turn your life around.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Only wish the story had been longer.  Loved it and it was a very quick read. So many good characters and would have liked to know more about them. Great Short Story
B006LSZECO|1.0|I only read this book because it was a book club selection and would have closed it after 30 pages.  I objected to the language and it was money misspent.
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|Great selection of songs. great performance by the band. Bruce Dickinson is energetic like always. I highly recommend it to any Iron Maiden fan.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was never a fan of this particular writing style, but the movie trailer looked so good that I forced myself into the series. And I'm glad I did. From the time I purchased the set to the time I finished it was about a day, I literally could not put my kindle down! I was completely drawn in. This world is certainly not new to the literary world, a government so in control (Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld is a good example), but the author weaves a story around this setting so fantastically, leading you right into the thought processes of the characters, the twists and turns... I can't even begin to describe. There were several times I wanted to throw my device across the room. I was so pulled in that I cried, a lot. You have to read these books. It's kinda life changing.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|I admit I knew nothing of this movie when I decided to watch it. I thought \\"Tin Tin\\" was a play on \\"Rin Tin Tin\\" - the name of the dog. Actually, Tin Tin is the young man and Snowy is the dog. I have to say I was impressed by this film. I remember when the movie trailers came out for this and I didn't think it would do well because the animation looks almost real...and humans don't like looking at characters that are close to being real humans ( but are not real humans) : it's creepy. Nevertheless, I quickly got beyond that and I found myself gasping and laughing and just overall amazed at this film.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|If you are like most people I know who start reading Reacher novels, you've gone through them all. This one ties much of the earlier ones together. I still believe you can read the novels out of order and get full enjoyment though.
B005HYNCTK|5.0|I've always been reluctant to review a music purchase, since I don't have a music background and therefore am not sure I can clearly express what I would like to say about this outstanding set.  I will just have to trust that my fellow Bruckner fans will understand what I mean when I say that I have become so totally immersed in Bruckner's music that, for me, there is no other music that even comes close.  Like many of the other reviewers, I also have purchased several boxed sets of Bruckner symphonies (I'm glad I'm not the only one who does this!) but I think I like this one the best!  To me, the performances &#34;sound right&#34; - I don't think they are too slow at all; in fact, I think that enables you to hear more of the details of the music.  Also, the sound is very clear and balanced.  The only downside is that the First and Second Symphonies are not part of the set.  I assume Celibidache did not have any performances them recorded?  Nevertheless, these are amazing performances, and although I will still enjoy the other sets I have purchased, this one will probably be the one I go to more often.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Well crafted storyline with good character development, fast-paced and attention-grabbing. Looking forward to the next book as this story has great potential.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I love this movie. I have seen the short Breathing Lessons about Mark O Brian. and really enjoyed it. This movie directed by Ben Lewin is a revelation. John Hawkes was amazing as O Brian and disappeared in the role. Helen Hunts was fantastic too. I had to buy this so I could enjoy it again and again. I am a big William Macy fan and he was so perfect for his role. This movie does not disappoint and I am shocked that Hawkes was not nominated for an Oscar.
B000002KB8|5.0|This album rates at five stars because the whole album is great. Buy this for your collection will not be disappointed.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|This book was good but not great. I realize that the author had to repeat things because the main character had amnesia, but it did get somewhat tedious. However, I did not expect the ending.
B000002KIK|5.0|Great album. May not be the best album from Black Sabbath but a lot of material that is very good that you do not here on the radio. It is nice to hear songs that haven't been played a million times. It is very refreshing to here the material that has been missing from my collection. I would recommend the album to any hard rock listener and any musician that likes black sabbath.
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|I can't really give you much information, because I quit watching around 3/4 way through. Just seemed like a caricature of people from that time period instead of an homage/representation. A little silly, and also a little boring.  Fight scenes were a bit over-dramatic and embellished, nothing very realistic.<br /><br />It really just gets two stars because at least they were nice enough to let Ryan Gosling be in the movie, and I watched for over an hour just to watch him be pretty.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Hole in the sky, great track. I would recommend this album to any hard rock listener. The tracks are all great and the heavy riffs do not disappoint. I highly recommend grabbing this album.

Sweat Leaf, Children of the grave, and many more explosive hard rock songs for the hard rock metal enthusiast.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I have been a fan of the \\"Little Women\\" movie since I was a young girl watching it on TV with my mother. I finally could not put off reading the book any longer and I'm glad I finally finished it. What lovely phrasing and wording!

B000N2HBSO|5.0|Great book! An interesting look at an amazing man and his unique approach to politics.  Today's politicians could learn a lot from researching Abraham Lincoln.
B004LROMSO|5.0|There have been so many movies, and series made, surrounding King Arthur and his kingdom of Camelot, and each has its own merit. But I've only bought this version to keep. From my own perspective, this gritty rendition of the story of the young king who must prove his mettle to take the seat of power, has a greater substance to it. The two characters surrounding Arthur (played well enough by Jamie Campbell Bower), Morgan, the half sister who wants to usurp the throne from the young king, is believably dark, and cunning (played very well by Eva Green) and Merlin, the counselor to the boy-king, who is plagued by his own demons, and strives to equally serve his Master and a psychosis which threatens to devour him (a stunning performance of the chaos in which he resides, given by Joseph Fiennes), create a perfect balance at the center of this legend.  No other filming of this story has brought with it a sense of how things were when this tale was evolving. It is a brash, non-nonsense telling.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|downloaded the app for my kids, can't stop playing it myself! Oh, and the kids love it too! would like more opportunities for pearls, though.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I rarely read a book twice but this is a book that I will read more than once.  This is the story of amazing courage in the face of many obstacles, of grace and the selfless lives of a Navy SEAL and those who loved him.  This is the best of the best!
B003FXXNH6|5.0|Some of the greatest fight scene I have ever seen.  Had to watch it more than once, especially the fight scenes.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|I've had the Scarlett for a few days now and I've found a couple of issues that are very disappointing to me.<br /><br />1) After connecting the interface and installing the driver on my Macbook Pro, I selected the device for both input and output but noticed when I did this it said, \\"There are no input/output controls for this device\\" ([...] I tried to use the volume buttons on my keyboard and they simply don't function ([...] The interface volume can only be controlled using the Monitor knob on its front. Once I figured this out though, it works fine with a variety of software I've tried like iTunes, iMovie, Garageband, streaming video, etc.<br /><br />2)  It turns out that it won't work with FaceTime. This is a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />I bought this to replace an M-Audio Firewire Solo interface that didn't have either of these problems.<br /><br />I've contacted their support group via email and although I got an automated confirmation saying my submission was received, I've heard nothing else from them yet. I'll give them a bit more time to respond and if they can help resolve these issues for me I'd be happy to keep it. But if not, I'm afraid this will be going back.<br /><br />System info:<br />Macbook Pro 2012<br />Mac OS X 10.8.3 (Mountain Lion)<br />KRK Systems Rokit 5 powered speakers<br /><br />******Update July 15, 2013*********<br /><br />I did hear back from Tech Support and they apologized for the delay. Regarding the message, \\"There are no input/output controls for this device\\", here's the response I got:<br /><br />\\"This message is completely normal for the 2i2. It has no software controls since the volume controls are on the hardware. This ensures the best quality sound output of your system since if you reduce the volume of the sound coming out of your computer before it reaches the 2i2 this will reduce the quality.\\"<br /><br />I can live with this. I think it would be good for them to mention this in their documentation though and I told them this.<br /><br />And about it not working with FaceTime, it turns out that although I still have a problem, it's not their fault. I'm connecting the Scarlett to my Thunderbolt Display which has a built in FaceTime USB camera. I discovered that the USB port on the display is on the same bus as the FaceTime camera and it simply doesn't have the bandwidth to handle both the camera and the Scarlett at the same time. If I plug the Scarlett into a USB port on my MBP, it work just fine. So, I can't blame Focusrite for this problem.<br /><br />I've decided to keep it because it works well and sounds great.

B0055S348W|1.0|Only works on Kindle Fire HD and not Kindle Fire. I paid for both and don't know how to get a refund for the one that won't work.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I looked forward to reading this book and, contrary to what another reviewer said, I did not find it predictable.  There were many twists and turns throughout and just when I thought I had things figured out, I was wrong.  And I really enjoy that.<br /><br />I found the writing descriptive and I was entertained throughout.  I would have given it 5 stars however I was rather disappointed with the ending.  It was just too strange for me.
B00AZM7IQC|4.0|Great material, I am a big collector and I am so happy with this BLU-RAY, WONDERFULL!!! CHECK IT OUT! ! !

B00BFTV09K|4.0|Now that I've read this book, I will be even more aware of how big business controls me, how it dupes me into buying their products, even feeling good about doing so. Eating and food is the 21st Century's version of slavery, and it's very, very hard to escape.

B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Yes, this is you're typical horror movie with the usual scare tactics. However, it still has a few good wiggle in your seat moments.<br />You'll be frustrated wondering why Ethan Hawke doesn't like to use much lighting in his house, but I still had fun watching this.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love it. its so fun. you could not and will not get bored with it.takes a while to download
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I feel like I lost two hours of my life. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman and I know he likes to be in edgy, sometimes off the beaten path types of movies. This isn't just off the beaten path, this is in another solar system. The acting in the movie is pretty good, but the story makes you want to pour hot sauce in your eyes so you don't have to watch it anymore. If you're into long, drawn out stories that seem to meander aimlessly until they get to the end, then this is your movie. Everyone else should avoid this unless you have insomnia.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely fascinating! I am typically an ho player however, this is just fascinating. It's sort of like an ho game in that you are solving puzzles to find your objects. One thing opens another and so on. Even though you are a specific type of game player, I highly recommend giving this a try. It keeps your interest spiked and it's next to impossible to put down. Love it, love it.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I've been a fan of Middle Earth for several years now and have looked forward to the release of all of the movies. At first I was disappointed when I learned the Hobbit was to be turned into three movies but now I'm excited and pleased by the prospect of three movies. For one thing it will give three more opportunities to visit the movie version of Middle Earth.<br /><br />This particular set of discs has something for everybody; the 3D version is effective and I found myself dodging a burning pinecone as it flew at my head. The Blu-Ray 2D version and the DVD also have excellent audio and video and are each enjoyable in their own way.<br /><br />One feature that I particularly enjoyed was the Special Features disc; it is filled with fascinating shots of New Zealand and, most importantly for me, the progressive story of the making of the movie told in 10 production videos hosted by Peter Jackson. The videos carry the process of producing the movie from the pre-production phase, through the production and post-production phases to the world premier in New Zealand. If you've ever wondered what all of those people with strange titles do then you have a chance to not only see what they do but to meet some of them as well. I was filled with a new respect for the incredible effort required to produce a movie like the Hobbit and get it to the screen!<br /><br />It was fun and very entertaining to watch and I recommend it along with the movie itself. I look forward even more to movies two and three!<br /><br />This one is a keeper and will stand up to repeated viewings; I recommend it for the entire family.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is well-written, with good dialogue, and it draws you in. Told in alternating chapters by Nick Dunne and his wife, Amy, it's the story of Amy's disappearance on the couple's fifth wedding anniversary. Flynn deftly introduces details in a gradual fashion, leading the reader toward an apparent conclusion, until a twist appears in the tale. The book is hard to put down, and I kept reading on, waiting to see how the tension was resolved. And...it just wasn't. After I had read the last page on my Kindle, I turned to the next, and was puzzled at first when it turned out to be an author's note or acknowledgement or something. I wondered where the rest of my book was. I went back and reread the last chapter, and realized that was it. It felt almost as if the author was a college student with a term paper to write, and once she reached her required page limit, she decided to stop writing.<br /><br />That said, Gone Girl was still a gripping read, and I'm not sorry I bought it. I just wish the ending had lived up to the promise of the earlier chapters.

030759565X|5.0|I love that this is a book full of recipes that have been tried and tested by an adventurous home cook! I have tried the recipes that appealed and have found no fault. I am a bit lazy for baking but Ms. Perelman has inspired me to buy the ingredients for a few of the baked goods recipes. Also, I am a huge avocado fan so the tartine recipe she included was amazing! Give it a go and enjoy!
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|There are so many good things about this show. It's like a less refined version of &#34;War and Peace&#34; with many interwoven plots and unexpected character developments; it's probably based on a book series but the show is so well done that I don't feel the need to read it. Unlike W&P, many of the characters you like can and some will indeed die, sometimes quite suddenly which adds to the authentic feel of the story.<br /><br />I normally don't like entertainment media in this genre (medieval fantasy) but this show holds my attention, possibly because it focuses more on medieval politics than magic and swordplay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game I love that when you want something you have to earn it just like in real life and I also love the \\"world tour\\" idea.
B000W9399S|3.0|It is hard to follow. I love Terry Pratchett but just had a hard time staying connected with this one!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was chosen for our Book Club.  We read the reviews in the paper and felt it would be a good discussion book.<br />I love the way the author gets you feeling all the characters and their emotions.  I felt like I was living it myself.  She has a way with her descriptive words & prose.  I couldn't put it down.  The plot/s keep you wondering al the way through and right up until the end.  A very unpredictable story with many surprises.  I know it will be a good discussion at our Book Club.
B000QCQ8Y4|3.0|I'm reading all these books in order. Have loved some and merely &#34;liked&#34; others. This one was somewhere in the middle. But you know the one thing that really bothered me about this book?  And this is a complaint directly to author Lee Child.... Why was it necessary to say that Reacher hated Alaska Airlines because they have a scripture card on the food tray? (Obviously, this wouldn't be an issue today. Unless you're flying first class, you're not getting a tray). But in all the Reacher books, we don't read anything about his faith ... Or lack of it.  Now in book 11, he refuses to fly an airline because they have a scripture  on a piece of paper?  Reacher puts up with lots of crap from all kinds of people, all kinds of inconveniences, and seems very tolerant of all races, creeds and sexual orientations... But THIS bothers him so much he won't fly the airline?  Wow!  So incongruent as to be unbelievable. So I can only surmise that this is Child's little personal dig at Christianity. Is he trying to alienate a couple of billion believers?  Or is he now just so successful that he doesn't care that probably (statistically) 70% of his readers wouldn't agree with his little anti-Christian rant. (Agree--rant is too big a word.  It just felt right for the end of the sentence) Anyway, now that I've had my own little &#34;rant.&#34;  I'll go back to reading my next Reacher book. You see, I'm a little more  tolerant than Mr. Child. I don't let my personal faith (or lack of it, in Mr. Child's case) dictate whether I will once again fly with Jack Reacher.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Was very interesting and moving.  Loved the way the movie handled the story.  I would definitely recommend people watch it.

B00B7IJBUY|2.0|OK So Bon Jovi are one of my top 4 favorite bands. I'm a huge fan of their harder rocking stuff and even some of their slow ballads. However, this album is nothing but slow ballads. NOT ONE HARD ROCKING SONG ON HERE!!!!!!!!! I don't know if they're just getting old, or if they they are just trying to make a quick buck. When I heard Richie Sambora's \\"Aftermath Of A Lowdown\\" I though \\"yes they are finally getting back to making killer music again.\\" Then I heard this album and said \\"what about now.......More like what What About Making Good Music?\\" I know since \\"Crush\\" the band has basically cut out all their harder sounding tunes. For example: on the \\"Have A Nice Day\\" album they cut 2 amazing songs that could have been instant hits \\"Unbreakable\\" and \\"Dirty Little Secret.\\" Only way to hear them is if you buy the import version (Of which I own.) So I could see the trend of their music progressively getting more mellow. I though \\"This Left Feels Right\\" was probably the softest Bon Jovi album, and worst concept for a Bon Jovi album as well. Why would you turn your biggest hits into ballads? Sticking to that point, \\"What About Now\\" takes second place for most mellow Bon Jovi album. I tried soo hard to find an once of rock in this album......all I came up with was \\"Because We Can.\\" Yes its an incredibly catchy tune but it's a very mild rocker. Now when your best song on the album is a mild rocker there's problems. Granted their are some decent tracks such as \\"Because We Can,\\" \\"What About Now,\\" \\"I'm With You,\\" \\"That's What The Water Made Me,\\" and \\"Army Of One.\\" However, all of them are more like remakes of \\"Always,\\" \\"Bed Of Roses,\\" \\"Diamond Ring\\" and \\"I'll Be There For You\\" spread across 16 tracks instead of butt kicking rock. This album to me sounds like a rehashed version of Bruce Springsteen's awful album \\"Wrecking Ball.\\" The other thing that bothers me about this album is that its got a ton of political innuendos. Seriously are  you guys trying to be Bruce Springsteen? Nobody cares about your politics, keep it out of the music. It didn't work on \\"Have A Nice Day,\\" or \\"The Circle\\" why would it work here? No wonder Richie Sambora left the band, he probably couldn't stand playing this crap on stage. Richie's \\"Aftermath Of A Lowdown\\" was an amazing album. This album for all intense purposes is more like a J.B.J. solo album (and probably should have been)which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn't fit the tone with your Bon Jovi die hards. What this band needs to do is get a hold of those rare tracks never released and put that out instead of this garbage. All the \\"New Jersey\\" outtakes are amazing. Why can't they use those and make a \\"New Jersey 2?\\" Not only that, but they have soo many other outtakes from their previous albums that never made the box set and are awesome tunes. It's pretty bad when I'd rather listen to unreleased Bon Jovi demos from the 80's and early 90's than listen to their latest album. On the positive note, I guess if you had a hangover this album would probably work for you, or if you're out on a first date with a girl and you need some background music....this album would work for you. However, to the loyal die hard Bon Jovi fans, and to the Bon Jovi fans who love the band for their \\"rock songs\\" this album is not for you, unless you're the ultimate collector. My advice to Bon Jovi is simply this:<br />1.) GET RICHIE SAMBORA BACK!!!!!!!!!<br />2.) USE YOUR \\"NEW JERSEY\\" OUTTAKES  AND OTHER UNRELEASED TRACKS AND MAKE AN ALBUM OF IT<br />3.) STOP FLUSHING OUT ALL ELEMENTS OF ROCK IN YOUR MUSIC!!!<br />4.) STOP TRYING TO BE LIKE BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN OR BOB DYLAN............NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR POLITICAL BELEIFS! THE REASON WE LISTEN TO MUSIC IS TO FORGET ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT...STOP REMINDING US OF IT!!!!!!<br />5.)AND MOST IMPORTANTLY.......GO BACK TO MAKING ROCK MUSIC AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />THANK YOU AND ...................YOU'RE WELCOME!
B0094M2NTG|4.0|It's an interesting story with the typical love relationship that develops between the two main characters.  For more - watch it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I was seriously considering not finishing this book, just couldn't get into it but so glad I did. It was a little hard to read with the broken English and I just couldn't get into the character of James, but I persevered and continued reading and am so glad I did. It did seem to have too much descriptions about their surroundings. Thought it was an overkill, one of the scenes I forget where Lydia was but the description of her surroundings was almost an entire page. However despite these issues it was a good book with well developed characters and the more you knew of poor James the more your heart broke for him and what he endured as a child. Give this book a bit to draw you in and you'll be so glad you did.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|As the title says, this movie was beautiful and underrated.<br />Although I did not see if in theaters, I was fortunate to buy it on Amazon.<br />I'm confused to why this movie isn't talk about. It had everything.<br /><br />It would be my best guess that anyone who didn't enjoy the movie,<br />simply did not understand it. In which case, this film is not for you.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of those stories that you'll be thinking about even when you're not reading it. And if you're addicted to that tight feeling in your chest you get when you just know two people are meant to be together, yet it's just out of their reach, this is the book for you.

B00BMT9SQA|2.0|I like Barbra Streisand, always have, yet \\"Guilt Trip\\" is not worth having her come out of retirement to waste her time. Actually, I cannot believe she did! I didn't like Seth Rogan in \\"Knocked Up\\" with lovely Kathryn Heigel and even less in this flop. He does not have good screen presence. Even less attractive men like Steve Buscemi can have great on-screen presence, but Mr. Rogan simply does not. Nor does he even vaguely resemble Streisand to pass as her son.<br /><br />And I'm just beginning my objections to this celluloid mess, which could have been better with script tweaking, nah, script rewriting. Some scenes had me think, aha, a passibly good one, then it isn't. An example is the silly free meal if you eat a 50-ounce steak. No, not Rogan, it's Streisand. The little flirtation that developes in this scene just did not make sense in that context.<br /><br />The only time I like Rogan occurs in the scene in which he finally, finally tells his mom to shut up! Streisand's character talks incessantly, INCESSANTLY! Even I was telling her to just shut it! Of course, her feelings are hurt. They always are when annoying people are finally told how annoying they are. It's this scene and all the preceding ones that make me curious why Streisand would take this role.<br /><br />OK, bottom line: The movie is about a man who has invented a tremendous product but has a poor sales technique. He invites his mom to take a cross-country road trip with him as he tries to sell his product. She is unaware that he is a failure because she is yakking all the time, telling him how great he is, how successful, how wonderful, blah, blah. She knows he tired of her and went to college across country to get away from her and now only sees her once or twice a year. Thus, the raison d'etre for the road trip--guilt.<br /><br />It's hard to read Rogan's face, except for ticks and twists and blips. He's not a convincing actor. And poor Streisand has had so much plastic surgery, her face is shrunken. She looks weird (although, I must add, she does not have a wrinkle on her face and she must be 70 at least!).<br /><br />There are two nice scenes toward the end which could have saved the movie, but they are wasted. They just do not have the power to erase the bad taste the previous hour gives. It's like licking an ice cream cone then the ice cream falls out. It's a tease, then it's disappointing.<br /><br />I wish I could give one good reason to see this movie, but, alas, I cannot.unken. She looks weird (although, I must add, she does not have a wrinkle on her face and she must be 70 at least!).<br /><br />There are two nice scenes toward the end which could have saved the movie, but they are wasted. They just do not have the power to erase the bad taste the previous hour gives. It's like licking an ice cream cone then the ice cream falls out. It's a tease, then it's disappointing.<br /><br />I wish I could give one good reason to see this movie, but, alas, I cannot.
B003B02OOG|3.0|These stories were interesting, but too short.  By the time I got really interested in one, it would come to an end.  If you like short stories, then you would like this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids downloaded this game, and it became a family affair. From the 5 year-old to the adult, we were all getting in the the action. The kids even had a competition going. Flow is addictive, fun, and the multitude of levels makes it challenging for all ages.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Although I had seen the movie of this, reading the book was even better.  The characters were exactly like they were portrayed in the movie.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|In my opinion this is one of Clutch's best albums.  One of the most talented rock bands out there right now.
B003B02PEU|5.0|This was one of his best I think!  You could feel the pain of and the jurors, and especially the feelings of the last one along with her family.  Truly a wonderful book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was indifferent on picking this up after reading the first months ago, but I'm very glad I did. One of the more exciting, suspensefull, edge-of-your-seat books I have read in several years. Compelling to the last page and I really struggled putting this book down for very long.<br /><br />Already purchased part 3 and I imagine I'll get through it just as fast as this one, if not more so. Highly recommend it!
B00AYB20KI|4.0|I really liked the movie and there were a lot of twists which made it interesting.  As far as OMG scary the whole time, no.  It was more of a story with small pieces of scary but when those pieces came in, it was scary.  The closing credits made the house creepier than it really was in the movie or the trailers I saw.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|This was a kick butt film! A combination of Thrill, action and drama...great creation. Tom Cruise was perfect for this roll. right up his alley. If you loved him in Knight & Day--you'll LOVE this!
B003JQLHY0|5.0|I needed a new dive watch, and after reading dozens of internet reviews, I ordered this watch with high expectations.  I was NOT disappointed!  This is a typical Seiko, very well built, very stylish, and perfect for what I required which is a dive capable watch that also looks good for casual wear.  When I dive, I try to travel as light as possible, and a watch that serves both purposes is great.
B0076DELIG|4.0|always enjoy Harry. this one has father-daughter dynamics. not his greatest, but, like sex, still pretty good. a good read 4 Bosch fans.
0670026557|5.0|Already expecting this book to be outstanding, I was still impressed and surprised by the quality of the writing, his artistry in drawing on research to help tell interesting stories, and the usefulness of his prescriptions. One of the world's foremost thinkers on this topic gave a lot of thought to how this research matters and has interpreted it clearly and compellingly for normal people. Best book I have read in a long time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This says it is playable on android but then says I cannot play on Android or on Kindle Fire.  I really want to play this game.  Anyone know if I can or not?
B0048IH666|5.0|Well worth it, good songs, bought it for my girlfriends birthday, she loves Kid Rock, she says one of his best CD's
B000LXH11C|5.0|The Essential Alan Parsons was purchased a s gift for my husband.  He is of that era & still loves the music.  Would recommend to anyone from that time period.
6305128952|5.0|this is a excellent movie with a top notch cast and a tear jerker from the opening scenes.  One of those major inspirational type films that reaches right into your heart.  but again...that cast...how can you go wrong?  (even the horse played a good part)
B00063EMJ6|5.0|The Neil Young - Greatest Hits was another purchase for my husband.  He loves good music & listens to it often.  Would recommend this to any fan
B003O86FMW|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS GREAT, CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE LAST ONE IN THE SERIES. THE TRAILERS TO THE NEW MOVIE LOOK GOOD TOO.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|nice game play and graphics.  would prefer a few more variations for the levels though. if you are an ironnman fan,  you'll enjoy it - though you'll miss Robert downey jr's voice. ;)
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie on the recommendation of a friend and about died laughing. Had to add it to our collection.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Jurassic Park Builder is the first game of its kind that I actually got into. It's definitely a fun, little simulator.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game! it is way better than the original one! I hope you guys make a 3rd one and p.s can u pleeeaaasssee make temple run oz free more people would download it including me!
B00CH87HF4|3.0|In-App Purchasing has got to stop. they further the difficulty to the point where you have to purchase gems in order to stay healthy when they only give you THREE health potions in 3 hrs. how lame is that. and to use gems when you want to speed up the upgrades and stuff. i rather Pay for the game $6+ than pay over $30+ due to the dumb in app purchase SCAM. developers please stop doing this to games. you are killing the fun of gaming. in the end you put more money into the game than IT IS WORTH. actually remembering so far how much money i did put into the game made me mark the 4 stars to 3. stop ripping off the gamers, developers.<br /><br />and i was looking forward to this addition to DH Series since DH3 was a disappointment since it was an arena wave battle format and not a true dungeon crawler like DH1&2 were. i do like the graphics since they remind me of Diablo 3. but you do need to fix the sprites since they get weird blocks around them. so there are alot of weird graphic glitches due to that, but it is fun gameplay and good eye candy. but again the In-App Purchasing has got to go with the dinosaurs. it does not bring repeat play interest because of that.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|DEFINITELY WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! I got it for my husband and we watched it, then watched it again with our 11yr old son and 7yr old daughter. JUST PERFECT!!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love horses and the sounds of their hooves but the app should be upgraded s o more people will get it.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I did not think this show could get any better, but it did. Purely addictive. I know I'll be paying for Season 4...
B000FBJFSC|5.0|heart touching and revealing book of a hard knock life.... left me wondering more how Frank/family did after he came to America... did he go back to his family, send money etc.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Lots of twists and turns that are really funny. Cute story and a fun easy read.<br />She's one of my favorite authors.
1439181780|4.0|Part 2 of the original Secret book. This is a good book for reading and learning new techniques on how to send positive messages out into the universe x 2.
1451673442|4.0|This is a good book for reading and learning new techniques on how to send positive messages out into the universe.
158270208X|4.0|Very nice. The pages are just the right size to write what you are really grateful for. Nice hard cover journal.
B00AJAFNIA|2.0|Well I got this app and then I read all the review and I got worried but after I played it it wasn't as bad just boring. So I recommend NOT getting it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game for young and old! My five and eight year -old daughters love it, as well as myself. Easy to understand yet takes focus to move!
B004QX07G4|3.0|I expected more of an autobiography type book.. It was still entertaining though. I would recommend to someone looking for a very easy read :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was really good I had such a hard time putting it down btw I'm not Travis I'm Travis`s daughter
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love it; it helps inspire so many ideas!!!! I am absolutely addicted. The only thing is, I wish there were privacy controls and you could decide who sees your pinning.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|my 3 year old son loves it.  He can let customers into the store and help them pick out their groceries.  He can scan the products and once the customer pays him he has to put the money away based on the color of the bills, pretty cool.  Great interactions
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Hollywood has drawn on the nostalgia of the older generation and the newness of the younger generation with just  enough old and new to keep both generations coming back for more.  This is a great story and will keep this used to be comic book kid coming back for more and more.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Being a comic book junkie as a kid, the nostalgia of hollywood bringing back all the old comic books to bring back the older generation and start a new following of younger generation is great.  Just enough old and new to draw both generations together.
B005LAII8K|3.0|Time Travel, action, drugs, although seems like a recipe for a good movie, it is slow and leaves you flat.  Bruce Willis is the only draw and I can see why this film received no nominations for any academy awards.
B004LWZW4W|4.0|Much better than the Mark Walberg one.  Cinematography was great, story line was good, and it really got you a sense of how the Apes started in making it a &#34;Planet of the Apes&#34;  A definate prequel.
B003UESJHY|5.0|I am a fan of any true story.  After I saw the movie, I had to do a little researh on the net, in library, and back newspaper articles.  I didn't believe this could really have happened.  You can imagine how shocked I was to find out that it really was true.  As I said I love true stories.  Watch it, Buy it, Love it.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|It is written in a funny way despite some serious emotional stuff happening, keeps you want reading, describes the English countryside in an appealing way, has a message...
B00899F0G8|5.0|This review is for my granddaughter who really enjoyed this show, I am glad that I was able to get the series for her so that she could complete before the 4th season began.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Can you yell me how I have no clue I've tried everything  please tell me how I am begging you
B00AB7HESI|5.0|EVERY ONE NEEDS THIS GAME YOU CAN MAKE A FLYING PINK MOOSE AND A BLOOD THERSTY  BOTTLE YOU NEED TO BYE THIS GAME
B008VBYN80|1.0|Seemed like a nice game at the start but as previous reviews have said that is just to lure you in to buying diamonds. Ok time killer for a while but once I got to level 20 the game started locking up regularly. And then all my decoration vanished that I worked hard to get and now the game won't go up any other levels. Very frustrating since it had the potential to really hook me. Now I skip it unless I am really bored.
141659521X|5.0|Great as usual.<br /><br />Rapp is the hero we all want on our side. I bet he would be a member of the NRA.
B00B8PMWJI|4.0|26 short horror films of varying quality, ranging from almost unwatchably disturbing to comedic.  Worth watching if only to see for yourself how this novel approach to an anthology film plays out.
B004YOEFG8|3.0|This product was not what I expected.  I expected Hubble space pictures.  They spent way too much time on the astronauts trainning and repairing the the Hubble space telescope.  The should have called this the Hubble astronaut repair mission.  They did finally show a few hubble 3D space pictures which were amazing!  But I would have prevered a lot more of that.
B004ZE1CVI|5.0|Great example of NWOBHM.  Satanic lyrics are fun and clearly part of the act.  It's worth owning the entire album, but the highlights include &#34;One Earth as it is in Hell,&#34; &#34;Plague and Fyre,&#34; &#34;Blasphemy and the Master,&#34; and &#34;Save us from Those Who Would Save Us.&#34;
B004EPYZUI|5.0|The way they made the movie, the photography, is very nice.<br />And have two versions of it and a lot of extras.<br />Nice one.<br />What I don't like: the case, because it is slim!
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|Anyone who shoots video knows that HD videos can be huge... The trouble with that is they can take a long time to upload into your computer.<br /><br />The trouble is USB 2.0 can be pretty slow, so even though you may have high speed cards, the bottleneck is at the USB.  This card eliminates the bottleneck and it definitely works well on the MacBook Pro.<br /><br />One point ... it does not come with any software, so, depending on the O/S, you may need to download the latest drivers from the Transcend web site.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Nice beginning for Batman.<br />Good movie, good image, sound and photography.<br />And extras of course.<br />But in a slim case.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I do recommend getting the omnibus if only because you won't want to stop.<br /><br />Series:<br />Wool, #1<br />Proper Gauge, #2<br />Casting Off, #3<br />The Unraveling, #4<br />The Stranded, #5<br /><br />My Take<br />Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! The things Howey can do to a stair tread! Taking every day things and describing them in a completely new way, making us feel and see everything. Just start to read that first page and you will fall into this story.<br /><br />Howey slowly pulled me into the truth of Wool. A truth that will shock, appall, and cause you to weep. And yet, it's a familiar plot of hope, acceptance, and gross betrayal. And an impressive story that still finds me crying. Howey gives this small twists with great betrayals, a deep sense of loss with some characters and yet other characters' deaths avoid that impact. A bit of a conundrum in some ways. The majority of Wool is subtle and made me think, and then there are the chunks here and there that feel too simplistic, too obvious. I don't know if it was Howey's intention to ensure I didn't miss his point, or to ensure my anger.<br /><br />There is a disconcerting back-and-forth---some of them are flashbacks while others, well, technically I think they are flashbacks, but they don't feel that way.<br /><br />The rebellion felt rather fake, although I suppose when you don't have access to books on history, war, tactics, or even fictional ones of action and suspense that it would make sense they'd screw things up. They just don't think that way.<br /><br />Okay, I'm missing just what war this will be if a cleaning fails. How will anyone know a cleaning failed? Is it simply not scrubbing?<br /><br />Reading of Juliette's underwater ordeal was amazing. I love how he used her natural ignorance of what would happen when she entered the water, how he caught the feeling of submerging, of feeling trapped. Like the lack of battle planning, I wanted to scream at Juliette about why she's feeling this confusion even though I know she can't possibly know when there's never been enough water for even a bath.<br /><br />Why are the rebels blowing up staircases behind them?<br /><br />Be sure to read all the way to the absolute end of the book. For some reason there's an epilogue after the page titled \\"Q&A with Hugh Howey\\". ...I dunno...<br /><br />The Story<br />Grief can do horrible things to a person's mind with a need to dig, to discover what could possibly have set another off. It's this curiosity that sets off a chain of events as the true powers-that-be scramble to protect their sense of order. No matter who or how it hurts.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Juliette Nichols is happy in her chosen element, Mechanical, and she hasn't seen her father, Dr. Peter Nichols, for twenty years, since it happened. It's her help over the George Wilkins murder that has brought her to Marnes' attention.<br /><br />Holston is the sheriff when we start the story. A good and decent man who misses his wife, Allison, a researcher in IT, terribly. Deputy Marnes has held that position for years and, yes, he has a reason for that. Mayor Marie Jahns is the ruler of the silo. As they say, the buck stops here. At least, so we think.<br /><br />Peter Billings is not Jahns or Marnes' first choice for sheriff, although he is for Bernard. Hank and Marsh are deputies.<br /><br />Knox is huge and very capable as head of Mechanical. Walker is brilliant with electrical, but a hermit while his former prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Scottie, has moved onward and upward into IT. Shirly is married to Marck, and she sees to it that Walker eats. Megan and Ricks, \\"Jinks\\" Jenkins, Caryl, Courtnee, Rachele, Pieter runs the refinery crew, and Harper all work in Mechanical. Jove McLain is in charge of Supply.<br /><br />Lukas works in IT, but at night he carefully watches for the stars and plots them. Nelson is the head of the cleaning lab. Good with lies. Bernard Holland is the head of IT; a man too big for his britches. Sims is in charge of security for IT.<br /><br />Pam works in the cafeteria in the upper forty-eight.<br /><br />Solo, Jimmy that was, has been alone for decades. Rickson, Elise, and four others have been hiding out.<br /><br />The Cover<br />I adore the cover of the version I read! It's the tweedy look of the wooly letters with the feel of flame behind them against the greyish yellow-green background and a few eaten skyscrapers poking up beyond the top of the hill and that flaring sun that grabs me.<br /><br />The title will cause you to dig, to learn the truth, to try and decide if you should pull the Wool back from everyone's eyes.is in charge of security for IT.<br /><br />Pam works in the cafeteria in the upper forty-eight.<br /><br />Solo, Jimmy that was, has been alone for decades.

B001NXBRJG|5.0|A great movie, a lot of extras and is a digibook, that I love, with pictures and info.<br />That's it.
0439023521|5.0|As is often the case, the book gives so much more detail and adds so much more richness to the story.  If you liked Hunger Games, the movie, you owe it to yourself to read this....and then Catching Fire.....and then Mockingjay.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|I wish that I could say something better than &#34;it was entertaining&#34; about this movie. Being a huge fan of both Seth and Babs I kept waiting for the side-splitting moment that just didn't come. Overall it wasn't horrible, but the script, not the job the actors did, was thin.
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|I got to admit, I didn't watch this show at ALL the first 6-7 years it's been on??!! I just felt it was the same old / same old tired Biker crud I've seen the past 41 (out of 56) years I have been going on WITH Biking, ya' know??!! But I got Amazon Prime now (well, for a while...) and I've been watching the available first 4-5 seasons ~ heh, HOW I spent MY weekend!! :-D LOL??!!! I confess ~ I am HOOKED!! Heh ~ really less insights as to what does or doesn't go down in real life (I don't care ~ I only go OUT to Ride these days ~ NUFF' said) but definitely a Biker SOAP ~ like LIKE it! Takes my mind off this friggin' house (and the work) anyways!! ;-) Just sayin'...
B008PALI5S|5.0|It's gotta be hard to live up to the hype: \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\" but this historic recording does, both figuratively, and literally! There are actually over 1,000 performers on stage, including orchestra, soloists, chorus, and conductor.<br />One night in Caracas, the young phenom conductor Gustavo Dudamel led the combined forces of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Simon Bol&iacute;var Symphony Orchestra, along with 8 vocal soloists, and a HUGE double mixed chorus, and a children's chorus, all from a plethora of combined choral forces.<br />Whew! If you give it a chance, the power of the music and the story will sweep you up into a life-changing experience! No hyperbole.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was very interesting to read. great plot, very interesting characters and easy to follow. Had me on the edge of my seat.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|I love this movie. Its a great story and its true a lot of people do get discriminated because of what other foreign people do in the nation they are not from. Don't ever judge a book by its cover. Love one another like we love ourselves!
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|What starts out as a tidy little teen-age coming of age mystery-thriller quickly begins to deliver the same emotional dissonance I felt when first watching movies like 2001 A Space Odyssey  or The Matrix.  Hope the next installment comes soon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A truely great game. Like the constant change of scenery. It could have more content along the line of upgrades and power-ups
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Personally I find Tarantino movies to be excellent homages to previous classic movies ([[ASIN:B00CL1SPYE Hanging For Django (Una lunga fila di croci) [Blu-ray]]]) in various genre's.  [[ASIN:B00CDT41RY Django Unchained]] is another in his list of hits that should especially appeal to anyone that enjoys a good tongue and cheek Western.  Fans of Westerns of the 60s and 70s will find a great deal to enjoy.  Now although I would have liked even more of a slant towards the \\"Spaghetti Westerns\\" and Ennio Morricone's delightful music, I understand Tarantino wanted to give it greater dimension.  I was glad to see him do a Cameo.  Superb directing, good story, great cast, fine sets and outdoor shots, and a variety of music ( I was partial to Morricone's).  My only slight complaint is the variety of music was kind of all over the place in style and period and to me made the movie slightly disjointed. Now I grant you much of the music in the 70s movies was similar, but I didn't like most of it either.  I wish Quintin Tarantino had given full control of the music to Ennio Morricone and let him run with it.  My bet is he would have come up with something like that in the three spaghetti Westerns soundtracks ([[ASIN:B001G5VISQ The Good, The Bad & The Ugly]], [[ASIN:B00C9ZNQGO The Man With The Harmonica (Soundtrack from the film Once Upon A Time in the West)]], [[ASIN:B005DN4YM4 Il mio nome &egrave; nessuno - mon nom est personne - my name is nobody (bande originale du film de Tonino Valerii (1973))]]) I mentioned and it would have been perfect and I would have given the movie five stars.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B001U6YI92 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]], [[ASIN:B00005YKJF My Name Is Nobody]], and [[ASIN:B00AEFYS8G Once Upon A Time In The West [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B002BWP49C|5.0|This is so great!.  The best &#34;beginning of the ending&#34; I have ever seen.  The last seen is just awesome - couldn't have imagined ending it in any other spot.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Ripley has returned, with an all new cast of characters, most namely Bishop an android but he much prefers to be called an artificial human. The crew come to the planet which looks cool but also reminds me of a junkyard. On said planet in a ship they find a young girl who's family was slaughtered by the aliens. The young girl's name is Newt and she is actual NOT an annoying little kid she's actually likeable. But Bishop is my favorite character played by Lance Henriksen who would later star in the grim horror film that I really love Pumpkinhead 1988. The crew eventually come across the queen alien and her legion of drones. The film is long but it seems to go over pretty quickly. Some say the film has a little to much action but there is still horror and suspense there which is why this is the best sequel of the franchise and I despise parts 3 & 4. I love this film almost more than the original. The picture quality and sound are good. Here is the disc features:<br />Main feature<br />Scene Selection<br />Commentary<br />Behind the scenes<br />Photo gallery<br />trailer<br />Alien 1979 trailer
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Loved julian marguiles and the women who plays Kalista.  Great  and interesting Lawyer drama with strong women characters.  the men not so much.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|I'm not at all objective when it comes to these boys. I love them each individually as musicians and together I feel they create some of the most astounding music ever recorded.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A truly remarkable story written by someone who knows the capabilities and the &#34;workings&#34; of the<br />human brain and why this wasn't &#34;just a dream&#34;.  JWB
B0074MZSWW|5.0|These guys have the skills, not a bad track on this album. Looking forward to seeing them live, hopefully soon.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The controls are kind of hard but a great game. Need more money to buy more iron men. I'm really wanting roasts armer
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very reminiscent of adventure puzzle games such as mist. Very clever and fun interface - be careful because time flies by in the room!
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|I felt that Daniel Day Lewis Performance was great. I would advise any history buff to watch<br />this film. even though it is not totally accurate The film gives a different side of the story of Lincoln<br />and what he achieved as President. the cast was terrific as well. The blue ray is fantastic too.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Plug and play in Windows 8 but if you have a problem it includes a small disc that has a cool GPS info program
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I love the &#34;Merlin&#34; series it is very entertaining and I enjoyed having the series in order.  I watch it on TV but missed several episodes so the story line was out of squence so by now having the entire series it makes the story complete.  This is a series I will watch over & over.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|I like mahjong games, but this one was too small to play on my Kindle Fire.  The game doesn't utilize the whole screen.  So for my eyes it is too small to enjoy playing.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Great movie - one of the best I have seen in years. Superb acting, superb camera, superb directing. Do not miss this movie!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|It took me quite awhile to complete a board.  It is worth the money.  I would suggest it to others.
B001KZG99A|3.0|Had problems with video streaming. The video playback was stuck intermittently when playing on Samsung tv. Had to watch on the computer.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Just read it!  Pure thriller, murder mystery. Great writer, couldn't wait to see how it would all turn out!!  Well- developed characters.  You don't need to know anything else.  If you've already read Gone Girl first like I did, read this next, almost as good!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has got one of the greatest gifts of all. The ability to tell a story that grabs your heart and soul and let's you know that true love in the midst of all challenges still persevered
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a great game. A variety of levels, with some easy and some challenging. I like that there is a time challenge, but you don't have to restart the game each time. I enjoy the option to change background colors to give a different perspective. Just bought the full version to get more layouts.
B009AMANH4|5.0|A great director and a great lead actor coupled with several excellent actors/actresses and how could you possibly make a bad movie?  Really, the movie highlights the intelligence of a President (politics) who had to deal with the differences between being a human being and being a piece of property.  Until you recognize that slavery, as an institution, made a human being property then you can't fully grasp the significance of declaration that 'freed' property and created a citizen.  Unique.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Well worth the price.  It found my location in Franklin NC no problem. I like being able  to drag it around  to check an  area we are going to travel to.  ozziefin24
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|This movie was made &#34;to be continued&#34; and I really dislike that crap.  It would have been better if the movie was labelled &#34;Part I&#34;, then you would know.  I don't think it stuck to the book as well as it could have.
0743270754|5.0|The author tackled an unusual and remarkable approach to providing insight into the amazing Mr. Lincoln with in-depth biographical analyses of Lincoln and each of the 1860 Republican Presidential candidates who challenged his campaign. Her story-telling skills, as well as her ability to weave these various accounts into a compelling read, is incredible. I found the book to a thought-provoking and revealing drama of the historical machinations in political rivalries, that often have often been less motivated by &#34;justice for all&#34;, than for power & personal agendas.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This movie was much better than the previous movies attempt. The movie followed the book plot fairly closely and the special effects were first rate and the acting, costumes and props very good. This movie would have done very well if it had been properly promoted and the release timed well both of which were poorly done.  A must for all fans of Edgar R. Burroughs.
B000GYI32M|4.0|Good and somewhat wholesome drama with a few cute chuckles thrown in to balance it out. There are adult themes but everything is fairly tame for teens to watch too. Decent mix of teen drama and adult situations intertwined in this somewhat affluent area called Orange County(OC).<br /><br />Characters are very likeable. Kid from the bad part of town adopted by rich Jewish family, neighbors are constantly in and out of wed and cheating, teens are constantly fretting over being...well...teens, grumpy rich old neighbor/relative that is always fun to hate, everyone is constantly in/out of trouble with the law, lawyers, or each other.<br /><br />Like Seinfeld, it is a show about nothing, but the writers manage to keep you hooked for the next episode of shenanigans in rich OC. This goes for all 4 seasons of OC too!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I watched the VOD version today. I was stunned by just how good the film was. It is one of the most poignant, touching and funny movies that I've seen it a long time. It treats mental illness and grief with a grace that is seldom seen in either film or literature. I won't discuss particulars of the plot because I won't give away the gifts the movie gives you. And they are gifts. Once you've seen it, you'll know why I say it.<br /><br />A few things to touch on outside of the plot, though - Sorry Christoph Walz, but Robert De Niro was robbed of the Oscar. De Niro was the best I've seen him in years. He made me cry and few actors can bring one so close to their characters that their characters become real and not just faces on a screen. Walz is funny, but I've yet to see more than one note in his acting. De Niro is like a symphony. He should have won.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper is fabulous and is going to be one of the best actors of his generation. Few come close to his range. (And no, I've never seen him in anything else. This movie was enough to convince me of his talent.)<br /><br />Finally, Jennifer Lawrence's character was about as different from the Hunger Games character as possible and she earned that Oscar with a breathtaking performance.  I can't say why without giving the plot away, but wow, was she broken and fierce and so much more mature than her 21 years. Just wonderful.<br /><br />See the movie. As you can tell, I loved every minute of it and I will probably watch it again to see the nuances in the film I may have missed the first time. It really is that good.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Just knowing this really happened made this movie so compelling.  Ben Affleck did a great job as a Director as well as portraying this nothing but amazing CIA operative in the movie.  I'd like to meet the real character he played as only someone as low key, determined, and unflappable could ever have pulled this crazy life saving adventure off.  Truly a miracle that these people got out of such a crazy and scary situation in Iran.  We wondered if the end was in reality as close of a call as it is depicted in the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Funny in parts, but has a dark, heart wrenching story line emerge as the book goes on.  Full of twists and turns, making it hard to put down. Very unpredictable in parts. Good writing!

1402270275|5.0|I got an ARC for \\"Heart of Iron\\"- the second book in the London Steampunk series which comes out tomorrow. About a page in I realized I had to read \\"Kiss of Steel\\" first... so I also have to review it first.<br /><br />But that's okay.<br /><br />Now you have time to drop whatever you're doing and read \\"Kiss of Steel\\" in time for \\"Heart of Iron\\"'s release tomorrow.<br /><br />You're not doing it... are you?<br /><br />Fine. Whatever. It's your loss.<br /><br />And I'm making a face that looks like this : <br /><br />ANYWAYS! \\"Kiss of Steel!\\" It's steampunk/Victorian/PNR- so right there you know I'm jumping around like a kid given free reign in a candy store. And even better, the book incorporates all these elements well.<br /><br />Or at least in my opinion it did. I know that others might disagree... but their entitled to their own thoughts as much as I'm entitled to mine. Even if they are wrong... (this is joke. Mostly.)<br /><br />I'm all flustered and not sure what to say, because I honestly adored this book. Honoria, our female lead, is trying to work through some serious s***. A female in Victorian England trying to support her sister and brother doesn't have many options. Add to that the price on her head, the not vamp (vampires are what happens when the bloodsucking Blue Bloods- who have a craving virus- go totally off the deep end and have to be put down) who's after her for her blood and then some, and some serious sibling issues and she's just at the end of her rope. Literally. Hanging. At the end of it. Which is wrapped around her neck. Choking her...<br /><br />Okay, I think you get my visual.<br /><br />So she turns to the rogue Blue Blood- Blade- who rules Whitechapel with an iron fist. Or rather, he finds her and has his own issues with the not vamp that has a price on Honor's head and wants to know if he can use her so he summons her to his wicked lair and then finds that he's incredibly attracted to this woman with brass ovaries.<br /><br />Over the course of the book they find themselves working together and against each other all because they can't bring themselves to trust one another... but can you really blame them? I mean it's not like either of them have had what might be called an easy life and by all outward appearances they should be each other's natural enemy.<br /><br />Thankfully, the actual vamp and the not-vamp draw these too closer and closer together until finally, FINALLY, well... I can't tell you. It would spoil the ending.<br /><br />Just know that it's good.<br /><br />4.5 stars. Excellent pacing that combines action, romance, and interesting peaks into the personal life of the rogue Blue Blood who unofficially rules the slums, his motley crew, and Honoria's messed up family.cause they can't bring themselves to trust one another... but can you really blame them?

1401232590|3.0|This Batman Noir Mystery is very cool, it has a re-imagining of some of the characters, & starts off pretty strong. I really enjoyed the theme of villains for the chapters, but I must agree with a previous reviewer, in that the ending was, weak. It didn't seem thought out as other Batman mysteries like say \\"The Court / City of Owls\\".<br />Usually with Batman stories, things \\"click\\" at the end, it would make sense as to Why, Who, did What. I didn't get that \\"closure\\" at the end of this story.<br /><br />There is still some good though, due to so many characters being introduced in this story, Mr. Loeb & Mr. Sales did a very clever thing. With each chapter, when one of these characters re-appears, they remind you of who that person is, that way you are not lost as the story progresses. That I have to say was very clever.<br /><br />All in all, I did enjoy the graphic novel, but I wouldn't recommend it to as a first Batman Graphic Novel. I say get a couple of other Batman stories under your utility belt, then you might \\"Appreciate\\" this story line :)<br /><br />I hope that helps.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Star Trek: The Next Generation is a seminal work in speculative fiction, and this is the season where it really hits its stride. With such classic episodes as \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Q,\\" \\"Sarek,\\" and the single greatest cliffhanger in Star Trek history \\"The Best of Both Worlds,\\" this season is certainly a great watch.<br /><br />Still, criticisms can be leveled at the high price point, which is the only thing giving me pause about this collection. If you can afford to drop $78 (or the eventual $550 if the whole series is priced similarly), go for it. Otherwise, you may want to wait for it to drop in price.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is an amazing story from beginning to end. The characters captivate and become real. I wish it could have gone on for days....<br />It was so good I couldn't' put it down so I finished too soon. I recommend this book as a 5 star adventure about a subject I never knew existed.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I am a Les Mis fan.  I saw the original stage play with Col Wilkinson, in the 80's, have seen it on TV many times, including the  25 year anniversary London production at the '02.  Missed the current stage production but did see the movie with Hugh Jackman.  I am glad to finally have my own personal film.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Even the children were nasty, except for Robbie.  This novel felt like it was written by someone who found no goodness in people.  Everyone's flaws were magnified, and their small acts of kindness received little attention.

B00CHVJ4SO|5.0|Obviously, since this isn't out on DVD yet, we watched this movie in theaters. But since then, we have been waiting rather impatiently for it to come out on video. Our entire family absolutely loved the movie - everyone from my husband and I, all the way down from our 15yo to 3yo. I cried, laughed, and snuggled my kids, right there in the theater. Can't wait for the DVD to come out because it's definitely a movie that our family will watch over and over.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|When one is reading a story that is well written, engaging in it's content and presentation, it is almost as though one is watching a movie. That is what I felt like I was doing while I read this book. This book was a captivating, lovely story. Well done Ms. McKenna!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have truly enjoyed both winter of the world books. Well written, factual account with enough added characters to make it feel personal. Well done.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I have actually watched the entire 5 seasons twice, and enjoyed it as much as the first time. Each season is unique in itself, yet ties in perfectly with the next one.  I caught a lot of things I missed and had a greater incite of each actor with the second watching, only wished it had more seasons.

B001LF347E|5.0|I gave this first seasonof Merlin to my 12-year-old granddaughter when she came for a visit in March.  She was completely obsessed with it - we watched 1-2 episodes before bed each night.  Merlin arrived in excellent time as it was a rush order.  My granddaughter is now hooked and would like to own all the sets.
0307948110|4.0|This book reminded me why I consider Robert Harris to be a thriller writer who stands head and shoulders above his peers. First there is the attention to detail. Knowing a thing or two about hedge funds and about Geneva and its environs, the little things are correct. This enhances my suspension of disbelief. The plot is a sort of alternate reality rather than pure historical fiction. It takes place during the day of the \\"Flash Crash\\" that happened three years ago. Interwoven with real life events, it is a heck of a story.<br /><br />Some of the complaints here about the book are valid and others aren't. The protagonist, Dr. Alex Hoffmann, isn't entirely likable and spends much of the novel doubting his own sanity. There is no villain per se. That doesn't bother me. It is rare to read a page-turner that doesn't rely on two-dimensional \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys.\\" Even the ending that many found unsatisfying isn't necessarily a problem.<br /><br />My issue is that there are a few characters and tangents that seem important but lead nowhere. What's more, given the fact that Harris obviously learned a lot about computer science and finance to write this book, some opportunities for more technical detail were wasted. I've been waiting for a really top notch financial thriller. I was excited to see that an author with Mr Harris's abilities had tackled the subject but feel let down. Even so, it's a gripping read and a chilling premise. I would recommend it.
B002RI98BA|5.0|Although much has been written about America's 16th President, Team of Rivals was the best account of his life I have ever read.<br />It combines essential facts surrounding the tumultuous events before and during the Civil War plus telling insights into Lincoln's character and those of his family and friends.<br />Having read the closing chapter of this book I felt as though I had lost a true friend.<br /><br />P Wells

B00AQO1VYY|4.0|Excellent idea to recover this record after all this time. Not cons if you know what you are buying I don't give a five star punctuation because I always will expect more from this disappeared band
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This movie was kind of slow moving.  The best part is near the end of the movie.  As with anything, the books are much better than the movie, but especially so in this case.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Love the movie.  It was just what I wanted and needed at the time.  thanks for having it available.  Thank you

0345803485|1.0|This a very, very bad book. I bought it because of \\"good\\" reviews. Now, I am wondering who were people that actually liked the book to give it more than one star? Teenagers???? Too much ado about nothing, if you ask me.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|These actors don't need anyone to waffle on about how good they were.................the whole set of DVD's of Thats Entertainment is simply that?.............................PURE ENTERTAINMENT..............Absolutely love it!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I went into this movie with a bit of skepticism, but I a have to admit, this is one seriously guilty pleasure! This movie is 4000 calories of your favorite food that you know you shouldn't eat, but it gets the best of you and you eat the whole thing..lol Make no mistake, this is no disney rated \\"G\\" story telling. This is blood, guts, gore, filthy language, humor, and yes of course, some great female body parts. I personally loved it and looking forward to a sequel! I want to see the unrated version now, how could it get any better??.. lol
B004G7UTXG|1.0|The movie went into frequent lapses, some lasting up to five minutes.  The interruptions were so irritating that I quit watching it.

B0058YPLA2|5.0|Awesome storyline, fairy tales reinvented in ways you never thought they could be connected, cant wait for season 2, an instant classic
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|For a free app it is fun, and easy to waste an hour on. The character designs and back stories are well done. Game play is rather difficult, with a steep learning curve for actual matches. I would enjoy it much more if you could pick a character and advance them over the course of multiple matches, instead of restarting at the beginning every match.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I had originally lost hope in that there were any good TV shows out there anymore. Hannibal is intellectually stimulating, terrifying, and entertaining to say the least. All of the characters are stunning and interesting. The cinematography is amazing. This is a wonderful take on some very classic characters.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I have spiderman and it is awesome. Really expected so much more from this game especially since it requires an additional 600 MB download once installed. Graphics are flawless but all you do is avoid obstacles while shooting enemies that are in front of you. All the missions are collect this or destroy that. Just not a great game for me. The tilt controls are hard to master and using the swipe option caj be frustrating if it gets stuck on firing guns instead of going side to side. I would only give this game 1 star for play factor and 5 for graphics so i settled on a 3 star rating.
0399213015|3.0|I love the book and story, but it's a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be.  Great for a gift but not to be used in a small group activity.

0988936402|5.0|The book up for review is \\" Everville\\" by Roy Huff. The genre is YA but is appropriate for all ages. It fits in the category of sci-fi fantasy with an emphasis on fantasy.<br /><br />First of all I want to say I am always impressed with how authors can create new worlds and characters in this genre.<br /><br />The main character is Owen who is a freshman in college. The novel starts off with him having a dream of a new world. But it is not a dream it is a place called Everville. Owen can transplant himself there by thinking on the location. A place that is run by Keepers and inhabited by Frons. A race that is peace-loving, kind and willing to help others. But there is a problem, Them. A group that is determined to take over all of Everville. A breach has been created and it must be closed. Owen with the help of his best friends, Anika and Dante, help the Keeper to obtain this goal. It does not help that Them transports anyone who does not help them to a place called The Other In Between. Here numerous Frons are placed moving around aimlessly like dull drones. They no longer have the traits that make them Frons. The trio must save this world before it is destroyed and hence reaches out to their world as well.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. This genre is not usually my thing and it has to grab me from the beginning for me to keep on reading it. This one did. The flow was amazing the pages flew by and before I knew it I was done the book. Bravo.<br /><br />This author will be having a 5 day Kindle promo on Amazon for it from midnight pacific Sunday 5/12/13 through 11:59pm Thursday 5/16/13.<br /><br />This book was received for free by the author in exchange for an honest review.
B0087EACJK|3.0|Simple and enjoyable, once again proving that challenge and entertainment trump flashy graphics. Sliding the sections of the screen around (part of the gameplay) got a bit tedious, but I still found it very enjoyable.
098555780X|5.0|There are a lot of knot books, but I have a hard time translating them into projects.  This book gives a bunch of project with cord length estimates, which I definitely need.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|Exactly what a mobile game should be. It's quick, simple to operate (although complex to master), has cute graphics/sound, and can be played for a few minutes between train stops or for hours on end.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|It's like he had a great idea, but then never really fully developed it. The overall plot is intriguing, but the details are either too predictable or too unrealistic, and the characters are not well thought out.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Beautiful. Well-narrated. Work of art. If you like Discovery, Nature, NatGeo, etc., you want this. This British version is narrated by David Attenborough, US version narrated by Sigourney Weaver. Your choice.
B005COO1X6|2.0|The beginning was intresting, but by the time I made it to the second part I had trouble wanting to finish. Yet, with each part switching characters it would have worked if the ending was succesful

B005XBKXV2|5.0|The Lion King. Great Disney Movie...always a pleasure to watch it with our son. He loves it! Great buy! Worth it!
0684803356|4.0|I think Hemingway has the fame he does because of his life and not his works.  This is my favorite Hemingway novel (admittedly, I haven't read all of them) and I give it four stars because it deals with Spain and I like the plot.  Even so, Hemingway thought he spoke Spanish, which he decidedly did not.  Early in the novel, while discussing the procurement of horses, someone says something to which another character says \\"Less bad.\\" I don't know if that's Hemingway, a translator taking this from a Spanish edition or what, but \\"menos mal\\" does not translate to \\"less bad.\\"  It's \\"all right,\\" \\"better yet,\\" or whatever phrase makes sense.  \\"Less bad\\" is just wrong.<br /><br />I agree with those who question Hemingway's putative brilliance.  I think his life is far more interesting than any of his works that I've read.  Still, I enjoyed the plot of this novel.
B007Z2IAAI|5.0|I bought this to play for my children.  They already love the Beatles and this was a great addition to our collection.  Every track is beautiful.  Love this on vinyl.
B0084IT59C|1.0|I wanted so much to like this book.  From the title to the author's story, it was set up to be great.  It isn't.  It stinks.  I couldn't wait to get through it.<br /><br />The other one star reviewers are right:  You either love it or you hate it.  I love the title, I hate the book.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Leaves you in suspense. I want to read the other books as well. Lemony Snicket is an amazing author. Beautiful illustration is kept in here as well.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Good tarantino flick, maybe a little too much of a happy ending than you would expect, but definitely fun to watch

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is my first time reading Mr. Landay's work and I was very pleased. The book was brutally honest and open about how parents tend to view their children and how they will go to any length to protect them. Had a surprise ending - much like a Jodi Picoult book. Defending Jacob kept you guessing to the very end with all of its twists and turns. Excellent read.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This has to be the most amazing series a ever. Sorry twilight and hunger games fans but this series will never disappoint.  I couldn't put down this book and at the last few chapters I was smiling like crazy because of the ending. This book will never, ever, in a million years, disappoint.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Just started reading it. Easy to read. Keeps you guessing about whats going to happen next. Like the character developement
0399160450|5.0|Well if you're looking to experience Tom Clancy for the first time, do yourself a favor and read the first two books leading up to this one. They were so good and got me so hooked I could not wait for the paperback publish date, had to buy the hardback. As expected this rates among the best books I have ever read, all Tom Clancy does.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow I love the graphics and the people you get to pick I hope there's a number 2 until then keep up the good work
B007THA4FI|5.0|Thoughtful, sensitive, realistic and insightful. A portrayal of reality behind closed doors. Excellent. If the reader is not British they might need to look up several slang terms peculiar to the British.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The title was compelling so I began it not knowing the author or having it recommended by a friend. I found it to be a satisfying story with a satisfying ending. I will recommend The Misrememberrd (my Kindle refuses to spell it correctly) Man to my book club members.<br /><br /> It isn't one to reread, but one to savor the first time through.
B0098460O4|5.0|I have  listened to their performances on  utube and thought they were great which led me to buy their first CD.  After  listening  To it  I was blown away.  They are wonderful.  Each and every song on the CD  is great. They do a fantastic job. Jonathan's voice is so rich and powerful and has the capability of going right through you.  They both are very talented.  They are wonderful together.  I  have played  their CD many times since I purchased it a couple of days ago and am looking forward to their next  one. This CD is worth every bit of a five star rating. They are going to be great stars.

So he heads out of his game on multiple adventures to try to change the way his fellow game guys and gals feel about him.<br /><br />I loved the game central station and the surge protectors. I also loved Vanellope and her candy go cart.<br /><br />But the movie, at 101 minutes long, could have shaved some repetitive portions off. And most of the movie takes place in the Sugar Rush game. I would have preferred more variety in games.<br /><br />But this is a good older kids' movie with game references and jokes that even adults will appreciate. There are some parts - bullying, song lyrics, innuendos - that I don't think are appropriate for smaller children.<br /><br />I was glad that the movie had English subtitles for the hearing impaired since I am partially deaf.
0345803493|1.0|I have found this entertaining illustrated REVIEW which reflects perfectly how I feel and think about it - especially the conclusion:<br /><br />goodreads.com/review/show/340987215 (or just enter on Internet: \\"katrina's review 50\\" and it will come up).<br /><br />For Volume 1, there were a comparable number of negative reviews as of positive reviews, which is a good proportion of negative ones, but because of the hype people will go on buying it.<br /><br />Now with Volume 2, reviews will be from those who liked Volume 1 enough to go on to Vol. 2. Unfortunately, most of the positive reviews are not as informative, articulate or thoughtful as the negative ones.<br />I believe that 'Thinking people' who have read enough about this book (while resisting diving into the trash itself) are just as qualified to give their many thoughts and opinions about it or about the subject, as are the illiterate readers who loved it.<br /><br />Pity even young girls will feel they have to read this book because of the hype, curiosity and it having become a centre of conversation - they won't be able to unread this book.<br />This book will have a sad influence, after the possible 'enjoyment' (if any. Not for me) of reading has passed.<br />People think of protecting their bodies but not their minds or souls.<br /><br />For a year now pics & links of this trilogy were on my default Amazon page (not my choice, and I don't appreciate it of Amazon!), contributing to the hype and free advertising; people think they are free thinkers but just look what publicity can do.<br />(I have only read parts of Vol.1, from a borrowed copy - not going to give more money to this woman -, but I've read enough about it from many sources to know what I think).<br /><br />Personally, spiritual forms of sex such as TANTRIC SEX do more for me.<br /><br />(Example: [[ASIN:1903816378 Heart Tantric Sex Diana Richardson]] - Use the \\"Look Inside\\" feature, and scroll down to mid Page 49-50 for a good excerpt. Note: the selection is different on Amazon.com, no page 49).
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Picking up a couple of decades after the 1st novel allowed us to meet the offspring from the original characters which leads to the storyline approaching WW2. The  characters overlap from different walks of life, political stations and international intrigue. Both sad and triumphant particularly as some of the charactersdie or change throughout the story. The best part as in the Pillars books was incorporating their stories into the history of WW2 and learning new things about that time. Similarly we have WW2 layed out from several perspectives which is the best part.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|tremendiously well done. Story theme and character lines absolutely terrific. Writers deserve great praise.<br />Even though want story to be fullfilled, at same time want to keep going.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Whild I preferred the Pillars novels, I enjoyed Fall of Giants as well for Follets laying out characters for all walks of life and what happens as they cross paths during the outbreak do WW1. The history of the war written as historical fiction is as just good as the storyline.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I thought this was an awesome ho game. There could've been more puzzles but the ones it did have were a lot of fun. Yet another great game by big fish with a cool story.
1591841666|3.0|It has some good ideas here and there, but there just isn't enough meat in the discussion to really guide you beyond introducing the idea that strategic quitting is necessary for success. Without much discussion about how to know you're in a dip vs. quitting in the face of adversity, the argument boils down to give up before you fail and waste resources.<br /><br />I don't think people are staying in the cul-de-sac by choice most of the time. I think people are probably not recognizing they're in one vs. being in a dip to work through, not sure how to extricate or unable to see alternatives.<br /><br />You'd probably have better luck reading it a page at a time over the course of time and exploring some of the concepts in a broader context as you work through your own life rather than turning it to it for any specific guidance.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|The show in general has a great story line, with great actors in each part.  You are pushed farther into the realm of the good doctor's mind.  Some of the scenes can be a little gruesome.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I hatd it no I love it no I hate it no I  love it no English muffin no American muffin no scratch that eggs no bacon nahhh lets eat lunch
B000KX0IOK|5.0|i think that ryan gosling is one of my fav actors he can just play anothing and this is such a great movie and not many people know about it
B00BE909NO|4.0|A great book, well put together, highly recommended, holds the interest from start to finish. Characters are very real and interesting
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|How can you go wrong with this series? I love this show. I was amazed at the high quality of the picture as well. I would definately purchase again.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is so worth getting.  Nothing is wrong in my opinion.  It should be free.  If you like diamond-related games, this is your game.  GET IT NOW!!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|How can you go wrong with such an awesome series. Loved the behind the sceens and other bonus material on the last disc.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved it! There was more character development, especially on Leo. It has a terrible cliff-hanger ending, excited for the next book!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I got this case thinking it would be better than a otter box. Seeing as how otter box cases are very bulky, a lifeproof one would be better. Well it is thinner, but you can not hear for anything. With the volume turned up as loud as it can go, I still had trouble hearing. I usually had to open the bottom where the charger fits so people can hear me. I would not recommend buying one.
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|WOW! U NEED TO BUY THIS MUSIC!! THIS CD IS INCREDIBLE!!<br />HE IS BACK!!! I LOVE IT!!! WAS AN EXCELENT GIFT A RECEIVED!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is way better than temple run it is very hard and challengeing but very good look no more for a temple run like game
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really love this app - so many mahjong puzzles are too small to really see the tiles, but this app is great
B004IV32HU|3.0|I think that the movie was too deep into the mind of the creator. There was not much wiggle room for interpretation and I did not fully understand where all the references and symbolism were coming from or the meaning represented. I think if I fully understood maybe I would have enjoyed it more,
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Great movie, love the ability to watch it in multiple ways including on my ipod and iphone, its very exciting.
B000R3NNDQ|3.0|Fun and a recommended read if you have time. A lot of common sense. No summary of the main points that was informative.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is so addicting....defiantly worth downloading. Haven't had any issues with it so far. The controls are a little sensitive but you can adjust it.
B00BC0JI6O|4.0|After hearing that Alan and Neal were collaborating on the writing of this album, my curiosity was piqued. Before that, I figured that this Beard album would be DOA without the presence of Nick D. I mean, how much turmoil and staff changes can a band take? Surprise surprise- its great! Ted Leonards voice and song skills have breathed new life into the old Spock! It is way better than X, which I really liked, and has good material across 2 cds. The first disc is full of great songs, without a weak one in the bunch. Disc 2 has a little filler (remix), but mainly is still really good. Favorite tracks are Aftrerthoughts and Something very Strange, as well as the Neal tune that ends disc 1. I am really keen on all of the tracks on disc 2, minus the remix. The 3 go together in a way that is most pleasing to these prog ears... If you were a fan of the Beard ever, get this. They are back!
0896898288|3.0|This quilt book is ok, but I wish the author would list the sizes of the quilt blocks on the index page. I am always looking for 12.5&#34; finished blocks.
1592332803|5.0|This book is a wonderful investment for vegans and health seeking omnivores alike. Filled to the brim with delicious recipes and wonderful tips. This book is a stained, dog eared, bookmarked favorite in my cookbook collection. I can't recommend it enough!!!
B00498YZH8|4.0|Great movie, we really enjoyed it. It's pretty riveting and the acting is amazing. I wouldn't give it 5 stars only because it's not a movie I could watch over and over again like some others (i.e. Pulp Fiction).
1451695195|4.0|This was an interesting book, but required some leaps of faith that not everyone may be willing to make.  Certainly he expects us to view his experience from his point of view but I still have my doubts.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I've  loved Linkin park from their very first album and this one goes back to their roots.  If your thinking about purchasing this, please do as its worth it.
B008NEMPTO|4.0|Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy) was one to keep me on my seat, of course we know honest Abe was not a vampier hunter but this was a great move.  Buy it or rent it and you will enjoy
0977326403|4.0|This book was required reading for my leadership course, it is well written and easy to read. It has some very good Aha moments that will really help you to understand and develop your team.
034580404X|5.0|I purchased these books because everyone was talking about them. It's not my usual choice f reading material, but was OK.
0765348276|4.0|\\"Old Man's War\\" is a good old fashioned sci-fi book. Take 1 parts future, 1 parts spaced aged technology, 1 part aliens and mix well.  Throw in a couple of twists and good characters and you've got yourself a winner, and that's what we have here.  The characters are well written (if a bit too fortunate at times) and easy to connect with despite being old.  There is enough action to keep you interested and the overall story does well to pull you into this brave new world.  Highly recommended for the Sci-fi lover in you.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Easy to use, but I seriously wish it at the very least came with a square root option somewhere! As a chem student, it ducks not being able to do it all with this app. Oh well! I'm still keeping it.  :)
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Everything you ever wanted in a Les Mis soundtrack. Laugh, cry, and sing along to all your favorite songs from the motion picture.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Glad that I purchased Mamma Mia! If you liked the movie you will like this CD. I definitely recommend it!
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Love this album! What a unique sound, very impressive for such a young artist. Jake Bugg is the real deal.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I like it. It gives an idea of what Beethoven and others have played like. Its so addictive somehow. Wow.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|This is my favorite book and the movie sticks well to the story line in the book exellent, great acting
1863513418|5.0|This was a book my daughter had been wanting for sometime.  I bought it as a birthday gift for her, and she loves it!  I am sure she will be ordering more soon.
B0084IHVC0|4.0|Alas, the Blu-ray may have been region free, but the DVD is not, fair warning to anyone overseas. Most content (the important content at any rate!) is still available on the Blu-ray, the picture is clear and the sound wonderfully clear and nostalgic. Not one of their most magnificent movies, but still a well loved classic
0062059963|5.0|Thirty-five girls came to the Palace to compete in the Selection to win Prince Maxon's heart (and a place beside him on the throne ruling Illea).<br /><br />Six remain--having earned newer castes as Threes and still with a chance at becoming the one.<br /><br />When America Singer first arrived at the palace she thought her choice was obvious: get thrown out, go home, marry her childhood sweetheart Aspen.<br /><br />After being in the palace and getting to know Maxon, America isn't so sure. She cares for Maxon, but is she really what Illea needs in their future queen? Can America become as fiercely competitive as the other girls? Does she even want to when a future with Aspen is still possible?<br /><br />Rebel attacks are becoming more frequent. Within the palace, America is learning uncomfortable truths about what it means to be a monarch and how her country came to be formed. Things are changing but America isn't still sure what that means for herself or her country.<br /><br />Everything America wants seems to be within her grasp--provided she can make a choice before the decision is made for her in The Elite (2013) by Kiera Cass.<br /><br />The Elite is the second book in Cass' Selection trilogy. It is preceded by The Selection.<br /><br />The Elite is another fast-paced, marvelous addition to the Selection series. With the parameters of the competition (and the world) established in book one, Cass spends more time here on the characters. While America's wavering and doubting was frustrating it did feel realistic.<br /><br />It's still hard to classify the series but The Elite makes it easier to assert that the story is, in fact, a Dystopia with some other interesting elements thrown in such as the added dimension of world building as America learns more about the history of the country. Illea has a messy, sinister past and a lot of secrets. Yet this isn't a story about a character intentionally trying to tear it all down or discover the truth or start a revolution. Even though, in some ways, that is exactly what America ends up doing. It feels very natural and very authentic and makes for a great story.<br /><br />Being a middle book in a trilogy, some things are left unresolved. That said, The Elite is an excellent story with just the right amount of summary of past events and new information. This book is a great continuation of America's story and also the promise of even better things to come in the conclusion to this series.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Crewel by Gennifer Albin, Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins, Princess Academy by Shannon Hale, Legend by Marie Lu, Cinder by Marissa Meyer, Divergent by Veronica Rothtion.

B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|And all my joy came back watching this. Absolutely adored the menu screen with the 3D island map. Both blu-ray & DVD are region free, for those wondering. As gorgeous as my memories.<br />&#34;All children grow up, except one&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome purchase! Couldn't put it down. Hope other readers find this just as exciting. Definitely a great buy for me.
B00746O3X8|3.0|The harness looks like it is built well.  It has extra straps that attach to the camera in case it falls out of the holster. I used this harness seriously for the first time yesterday. While it provides some support, it tends to slip down in front due to the weight of the camera.  Even when I tightened it around my waist, it didn't seem to help much.  I kept having to adjust it,  The worst thing is that when I tried to take my camera out of the slip, the connector that screws onto the bottom of the camera often got stuck in the holster.  I imagined a nightmare wedding where I kept missing the best shots because I couldn't get my camera out of the holster. Since it was just a casual outing, it was okay, but I would make sure you don't have the same problem before you use it in high performance situations.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|it took me out into a world that i am glad i don't have to be there. part of the nwo? devilish like them.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|One of my favourite stories with Jack Reacher as the hero.  This saw Jack using all his army skills brilliantly - what a crack shot!!
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I learned a lot about body language from this book. I was very impressed and dould not put it down
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Poor old Jack - wrong place at the wrong time!  Good story and easy to read with a little bit of a love angle to make it more interesting.
B0047VSW30|5.0|This is a truly great movie: Location, cinematography, and plot. It is the classic Theme that caused great controversy and required many, Agora included to go to their death for asserting what they believed. Do we really have a Sun Centered Earth.Do the planets all revolve around the sun. Agora was dragged from her \\"home\\", killed , and burnt on a pyre for heresy in the 4th century. All amidst feuding by Pagans, Jews, And Christians.1200 years later the astronomer Kepler rediscovered one of Agora's \\"curves\\" to prove a Heliocentric Universe.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very well written with good character development.  I love a book that keeps calling me whenever I have free time.  This one fit the bill.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|One of the best love stories I have seen in years! Would have given it a 5, but the beginning was a little slow.
B004LZF2LW|2.0|I downloaded the app while on vacation out of the country and everything seemed to be set correctly.  I had my wake-up call to &#34;Rooster&#34; setting but he never would crow!  I contacted Amazon who gave me the PolyClock web site to see what could be the problem.  PolyClock replied promptly and couldn't explain why this happened,  They suggested I try a few things (make sure Kindle Fire HD was on, open the magnetic cover as this might interfere and even showed a screen shot to make sure my alarm did end the program)  but to no avail.<br />I just contacted Amazon who as always, was efficient, professional and courteous and they issued a refund.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|... along came Tom Keifer's solo effort.  This is a great album.  You can play it start to finish.  Cold Day in Hell and A Different Light should be huge hits, but since Tom isn't backed by Disney this likley won't happen.<br /><br />If you're a music fan looking for something fresh, pick this one up.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|So many bugs, the app will not open on my phone. Just keeps crashing and I don't know why, unfortunately.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Love this game. Have played all of them up to now. This one is the most exciting and worth playing.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|You are not buying the whole game, only 5 acts that you can get through in two hours time. To unlock more levels you need to pay another 99 cents. It's not the price that's the problem, but the principle of holding back content without accurate disclosure. That aside, I didn't even finish the levels it did come with because the game is so horrible. There is no replay value, the controls are incredibly glitchy, and even when the controls do work the gameplay is completely dull. On top of it all, the install size on this game is around 150 kb, which is about double or triple that of higher quality games like Angry Birds or Plants vs. Zombies.
0743289692|5.0|I just admire Ayaan's courage! She is brilliant and has nerves of steel. Although I don't agree with all her views but she sets the debate than there are so many places where women's rights have been trampled and this needs to change.
B0000542D2|4.0|This review is for the reviews, not the DVDs. I'd like to buy one of the DVD versions of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", but although there are about six different versions of the DVDs, at all different price points, the reviews for each are identical (at this date, a total of 473 for each), so there is no way to see what product the reviews are for.  First time I've run into this on Amazon, I hope they straighten it out....
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is so fun and it has great graphics and the hot air balloon was cool and just the game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Equal parts surprising, touching and poignant.  Very well and sensitively written.  You can't help but cheer Pat on from start to finish and hope that silver linings always shine through.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is a book out of the mainstream.  At times it has humor, but a lot of real-time life pathos. It is well written and opened my mind to a current profound issue. This was our book club book; one I will never forget. In our discussion we all liked the characters and we all agreed it was a great choice. This book is good for a book club.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|i have a love/hate relationship with these games. love to play and hate when i don't get all three stars!!! fun, challenging and always great. Who doesn't love the birds?!!!
B00005B5L4|5.0|This is one of my top 3 for demonstrating DTS on my 9.2 system. Great Music separated into clear channels. Much better than live performances with too much ambient applause. Just great music delivered greatly.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I learned some interesting facts about WWI but the story lines of the characters were a little light at times.
B000GOVU3G|5.0|How associations lead to new relationships, forgiveness and maturity. Kudos to the dog trainers on this adaptation of Willie Morris's work. The cemetery at Greenwood is in another town.
B0053FANS6|1.0|OH MY GOD!!! A EVIL MUMMY IS TRYING TO KILL AND CONSUME THE WHOLE PLANET!!! BETTER CRACK SOME JOKES! I HATE THESE MOVIES! THESE MOVIES ARE WHATS WRONG WITH ACTION MOVIES TODAY THEY TRY AND JOKE EVERY 5 MINUTES WHILE EVERYTHING IS DYING AROUND THEM!
B003L16FAE|5.0|This is in my opinion Arnies best work. I think it is better than Terminator, or Conan. Maybe True Lies can come close, but True Lies is not available in Blu ray DTS widescreen. If it were I'd gobble it up too.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|THE ONLY GOOD ONE OF THE THREE TO ME WAS DARK KNIGHT, THANK YOU HEATH LEDGER FOR THAT,THESE MOVIES DONT CAPTURE THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE OR VIBE OF BATMAN ,BATMAN SHOULD HAVE MORE OF A HALLOWEEN VERY DARK ALMOST GOTHIC VIBE LIKE THE COMIC BOOKS,THESE MOVIES SEEM TO IGNORE THE ACTUAL STORY LINE OF BATMAN(WHEN WAS DICK GRAYSON A COP????)I HAVE BEEN READING BATMAN COMICS MY WHOLE LIFE I HAVE BATMAN AND JOKER TATTOO'S AND FOR SOME REASON THESE MOVIES JUST DO NOT DO IT FOR ME I THINK THE REASON IS BECAUSE THESE MOVIES SUCK, ALSO BATMAN WEARS A GREY NYLON SUIT NOT PLASTIC RUBBER SUITS...I GUESS I CAN SEE WHY THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD LIKE IT BUT FOR A HARDCORE FAN I JUST PICK AT IT TO MUCH I GUESS....THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS 1 AND 2 CARTOON BLOW THESE MOVIES OUT OF THE WATER AND SO DOES BATMAN YEAR ONE
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|Tom cruise does an excellent job here, basically placing an authoritative imprimatur in the definition of Jack Reacher. Rosamund Pike is very hot. Kinda makes eye contact in an introspective way.

B007FO5PYK|5.0|As a ballroom dancer one just cannot forget the classic scene where Pacino gives Anwar the Tango Lesson. Does anyone know where in NYC this happened? You don't need CGI for greats like this. The definition of an 'A' movie.
B000EUDAWG|5.0|I love it.  Very life like.  This spider really looks life like at a distance.  Very Cool. My sisters dog was really scared of it.
B0000A14WB|4.0|Good Music, fair on DTS. I probably expected more what can you really expect from that era? Great music but technological limitations.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Awesome book I can't believe they stoped making more books in the series! I highly recommend this to any one with an interest in Greek mythology.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I generally think of Orlando Bloom as a wimp except for his exceptional performance in this movie. The bad guys are also fairly well developed and hatable. The production is in a class of its own as is the Widescreen arrangement and DTS mix. One to see over and over.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I was diagnosed 1 yr. ago with Stage 4 Terminal Melanoma Skin Cancer, so I can relate to how an illness & pain truly makes your reevaluate your life forward from the 1st day you hear that awful news.  You have a choice to be positive by loving and understanding people or being negative, angry, envious all which will add to your illness.  I am recommending this book to many family and friends hoping to make this world a much better place. (I just wish the media would give televised time to someone trying to make a better world for all)
B007CKNX28|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase which was on a whim, now I can't stop listening to the CD!
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|I am a Hitchcock fan and always will be. I love his movies and they are always precise and well made. This will always be one of my favorites. The actors are superb. This is for adults only due to Hitchcocks always &#34;scary&#34; and sometimes bloody scenes. But he is simply the best.
B00AL6SM0S|5.0|Pristine editions of great performances. The singers never sounded better because of original beautifully restored. $70 is steal price. I am waiting for verdi and mozart
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally addicted to this game can't stop playing love doing the different challenges each time anyone would really like this game.
0066620996|5.0|Great read for entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs to understand marketing and how to stand apart from the competition. Takes out the &#34;me&#34; in a company's success, and makes it &#34;we&#34; win! This book gives a complete data by comparison breakdown of how to make a company work. It's not &#34;what&#34; you do, but it's &#34;how&#34; you go about doing it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an great app. Its a very addictive game I play almost everyday. Very enjoyable to all ages.! Hope you like it!!!
B00A83075M|5.0|It is a great family movie. The disc played without a problem. I recommend this movie. I never played the classic game but apps are available where you can play the  game, with better graphics and technology, of course.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|EPIC, EPIC, EPIC! Wish I could wipe my memory and read it fresh again! Brandon really wraps all the characters, plots and geography together in one incredible finale. Enjoy!
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I really enjoyed this product, especially seeing my children played with the toys that came with it. Movie and mechanical Easter eggs? Good Choice!
B008XG1X18|3.0|One of my nieces recommended this.  So I purchased it.  I have since realised it is not for me.  I can not say much about this since I deleted it I think the same day.
B00AEFXE9U|5.0|Almost Famous is by far my favorite movie. It takes you back in time to make it seem like you're actually in the 70's. It's such a captivating movie for everyone watching it.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is a great app if you love puzzles.  There are many levels and the puzzles are nice to look at.
B0058SNIC6|4.0|the only thing I didn't like was the fact that they squeaked as I walked.  Just part of the plastic I guess.
B009MYARIK|3.0|This book is classic chick lit, but is silly even for the genre.  A good choice for a light read though.
B000I186FW|5.0|A movie is good when you want to watch it again.  I have watched this movie at least 10 times.  It's like a great piece of art; you never get tired of it. Natalie Portman's acting is like a fine wine; it's nuanced, it's perfection. I watch her scenes over so I can savor her performance.  V has a mask, yet he commands the screen better than any of the overpaid actors of today.  The cinematography was incredible, such mastery.  It wasn't the story so much as to how it was told.  I gave my last copy of this movie to my daughter and I miss it.  I ordered it from Amazon so I could watch it again (and thus, the review).  There are wonderful little threads that run through the movie: music, &#34;the Count of Monte Cristo&#34;, tV loves to twirl his knives before he throws them, Shakespeare, &#34;no coincidences&#34;, etc.  Did I say Natalie Portman was great.

B009MYARIK|1.0|Thin plot, too many characters... Disappointing work- I flipped through many of the pages as the story eczema predictable and repetitive. Her older books are much better, I'd re-read shopaholic instead!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Writing was awe full at first, but eventually you get caught up in the story line and forget. Very different from anything I have read before.
B00BVMXBVG|1.0|Having watched the first six of ten episodes in season one,<br />I was already prepared to pre-order this title.<br /><br />However, note that this series, which was broadcast in<br />high definition 16:9 by BBC America, is being offered on<br />DVD and Blu-Ray in a 1.33 aspect ratio.<br /><br />What were they thinking?
B0041G68KU|3.0|I found the ending of the story somewhat disappointing. This book is not Susan Hill at her best. She can do better.

B00B47NO2O|4.0|I loved the series EXCEPT for the ending! What a let down. It was creative and spell binding through out the series. I even found myself liking Joe. Kevin Bacon was great, like usual! I could have tolerated the way it ended if they would'nt have add the last 10 minutes.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Pros:<br />Cheap<br />Efficient<br />Quiet<br /><br />Cons:<br />I have nothing to complain about.<br /><br />More Info:<br />My unit was excellent. This is the first 3rd party cpu cooler I have ever used. The instruction were well written, as well as easy to follow. Unfortunately, One of my fan mounts were cracked when I took it out of the box. My fan mounting bracket was overly tighten at the factor.  Fortunately, it's still operational.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good air cpu cooler, this is the one for you!

076421120X|5.0|If I was going to use one word to describe Darling Zschech, that word would be legacy. She has helped to usher praise and worship into the forefront of Christian thought. Revealing Jesus: A 365-Day Devotional is an outpouring of that legacy. 365 very short and applicable lessons beautifully packaged in a slightly more than fancy exterior. These devotions stem from Darlene's own personal thoughts and journal entries which cause the readers to reflect on Jesus and meditate on the love which He lavishes on us. Throughout the book you will soar the heights of heartfelt worship and plumb the depths of sorrow all without losing sight of Jesus.<br /><br />\\"Throughout Scripture, God's people called to Him for deliverance and He saved them. When you think all is lost and suddenly find yourself a victor-against all odds-how can you not celebrate our mighty God? In Psalm 68:19, the psalmist declares, 'Blessed be the Lord-day after day he carries us along. He's our Savior, our God, oh yes!' What a tremendous cry of praise. But these words are also a reminder that God is our Savior and our strength. It is not by our might and cunning that we are saved; victory is a gift from God. his presence literally imparts power and strength to help His people. He knew our temptation to exalt ourselves and take credit for what God has done on our behalf. Have you ever cried to God for deliverance, received it, and then forgotten to give Him thanks? You are not alone. After any victory in your life, great or small, always take time to express thanksgiving. don't just move on as if it is business as usual, lest you lose the blessing of learning to trust Him more, becoming better able to face bigger and greater things with grace and faith. My prayer for us today is that we always take time to celebrate the unfathomable power and the simple kindness of god in our lives. We will never truly know this side of heaven all that he has rescued us from.\\" January 8<br /><br />Short passages of truth fill this devotional and make it more than readable and applicable. This is a great beginning devotion which is chock full of scripture and personal musings on God. i enjoyed the balance of highs and lows in this devotional. It wasn't too Osteen-esque but it was also not beating me over the head with Gods wrath. The pages are fancy and colorful and the months are separated by eye-catching covers which include the lyrics from Darlene songs over the years. i would recommend this book to any beginning christian who is looking for a good place to start or needs a helping hand from the beat downs of life. If you think you're too spiritual for a simple devotion than you may have missed the point of our whole salvation, the exalting of God in the praise of His people. This devotional helps you get back to that point.<br />If you like Darlene Zschech than I would highly commend this book as an extension of worship music she has written over the years. It may even go well with the CD of the same name playing in the background.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

B00112ASXK|1.0|No where in the add did it state that this is small enough to fit inside a child's hand. I was expecting it to be bigger, sort of the size of the Breyer type horse statues, at a 1:9 scale.  It never said that this was very small and almost 3 or 4 inches long.  I'm disappointed. Wasn't what I was looking for.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This is an exciting and accurate peek into the lives that were engulfed in the quest to find Bin Laden.  Truly remarkable.  Espcecially the end! 12 years spent looking for America's most wanted and the respect of the President in the process!  Amazing!
B007PPE086|5.0|This doll, and others within the monster high franchise are my 4 yr olds absolute favorite; I think I have purchased around 10 now! The one thing I feel that is sort of a letdown is the hierarchy of these dolls. The price of the doll will greatly improve the &#34;wow&#34; factor your child will have; my point is that this doll is a standard posing doll, with great humanistic likeness (aside from the detachable/interchangeable body parts), but again lacks the wow factor. The more expensive dolls in this franchise line actually have some sort of function, whether it is howling, push-button glowing, or some other eye-catching, &#34;Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, look...look!&#34;<br /><br />For the amount of money consumers pay for these toys, Mattel should make these dolls equal across the board, especially for the simplicity in adding a LED or pre-recorded voice chip; as well as prolonging the marketing of said franchise.<br /><br />This of course coming from a &#34;gullible&#34; daddy for his beautiful doe-eyed daughter!<br /><br />Vr<br />Keith

B008476HBM|5.0|No matter how many times in reading I am always amazed by the masterpiece Jane Austin has created. A true classic leaves the reader always wanting to know more of Elizabeth and Darcy's story.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|In an attempt to be very authentic, the author or his editors failed to provide the reader with a coherent story line. There were several sections (the &#34;Woman of the Butterfly&#34;, the &#34;Core&#34;) that were sprung on the reader seemingly out of the blue. If you believe in near death experiences as proof of an afterlife, then you would probably give the author some slack and like the book.

B005VPRET4|5.0|First of all, I have to say I don't agree with people who think these are a frail attempt for Lego to address gender biasing claims. These are great Lego's and different from most stuff that they have released previously. I think it is a great idea!<br /><br />My daughter got this set as a gift and she built it by herself for the first time (she is 7). Now that it is built, she uses it occasionally but my son (who is 5) really likes to play with this set as well!<br /><br />We like playing out military/police/counterTerrorism scenarios with our Legos. With this set, I can finally teach him the importance of soft targets as a method of progression with a guerrilla based campaign fought by an under equipped and under funded army. We set up our artillery on the coffee table and put \\"Outpost Screwed\\" (That's what we named it) out in the middle of the wood floor. If our artillery bombardment doesn't do the trick, we go in with our Armored Vehicles and supply .50 fire from a few hundred yards out. If all else fails (and if often does), we send in the foot soldiers to pull those cute little Lego Friends out by their boots and string 'em up on the Prince of Persia set we got 2 Christmases ago.<br /><br />The fun never ends in our house! I highly recommend this product.

B002C949KE|5.0|The author is a genius in the sense of looking for the real engine of man decitions. BEWARE it can result in understanding and controlling irrationality in your life.  It is not a dogmatic book, but rather based on experimental results that do not move on traditional ways, but simple to understand  and with a very nice logic and results.  For sure Ariely has a lot of work to do, to demonstrate if these results are only valid on developed countries and wath differences appear as a result of cultural differences.

6305137293|5.0|Halloween 2 continues where the first left off. Myers is still on the loose and Dr. Loomis is hot on his trail as the wounded and medicated Laurie Strode is left vulnerable in a nearby hospital. We are introduced to some new supporting characters in the way of doctors, ambulance drivers, nurses and a deputy. Halloween 2 was made in 1981 three years after the first movie. The first movie had spawned a ton of copycats and slashers that focused more on gore than the suspense that made Halloween one a classic.<br /><br />  The gore in this movie is good. It helps to separate the first movie from itself. The gore helped make it not the same movie. It still has suspense as the ending rocked and was very suspenseful. The hospital setting is very creepy and atmospheric as Myers could be looming anywhere.<br /><br />  The movie moves pretty fast from the beginning shot. One of the things I liked about this movie is it was never slow. There was always action. The acting was very solid as we are introduced to a lot of characters. Another strong point is the ending. It had to be one of the best endings to a horror movie I've ever seen. It was exciting.<br /><br />  One negative aspect of the film is Jamie Lee Curtis is in drugged up from the surgery in the hospital half the film and unable to make the acting impact til towards the last third of the film. Even so she still gives one of her best performances in a horror movie. I thought it could have worked setting this film five to ten years after the first halloween but with the way they chose it here it worked very well.<br /><br />  Donald Pleasence gives a performance to match his performance in the first movie. The Sheriff Charles Cyphers is great in the small amount of time he is in the film. Hunter Von Leer does a great job as the Deputy. Lance Guest who plays Jimmy the ambulance driver who knows Laurie gave a solid performance. He was very likable although he doesn't fit the mold of a tough guy hero he is a good guy. He maybe overmatched with Myers but I'll let you see what happens. The confrontation of Loomis and Myers in the end is nothing short of epic.<br /><br />  Jamie Lee Curtis is the greatest Final Girl of all time. I loved watching this movie as a kid and it still holds up today as my favorite horror movies. Both Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence were great iconic actors in the horror genre and this movie helped to cement their legacies and making this film unforgettable. I reccomend this to all horror movie fans and those looking for a good scary movie on Halloween. Cheersmaybe overmatched with Myers but I'll let you see what happens.

B001WCN232|5.0|I always thought the TITLE of \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" was rather unique & funny as hell.  The Stones DID choose some really interesting album titles for the 1970s, hence THIS title & \\"Sticky Fingers\\".  Too bad that they DIDN'T record SONGS w/ these STRANGE titles.  I orig. bought THIS record in 1974, & the remastered CD on April 26, 2013. \\"GOAT'S HEAD SOUP\\" album will be 40 YEARS OLD...later THIS year.  It's time for my review now:<br /><br />1.  \\"Dancing With Mr. D\\"...This song contains some EXCELLENT guitar work.  Good beat, but the lyrics can fool you. But still, I have always enjoyed this song, anyway.<br /><br />2.  \\"100 Years Ago\\"...I wasn't too crazy about this song @ first, but now I can honestly say it has grown on me & l like it much better, now.<br /><br />3.  \\"Coming Down Again\\"...This song is pretty good, I have always liked this.<br /><br />4.  \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)\\"...This song did make the TOP 40, stalling @ #15 in 1974.  This song is pretty good.<br /><br />5.  \\"Angie\\"...This #1 hit single will always remind of September 1973, when I entered my Senior Year. I've always liked this song, very much.<br /><br />6.  \\"Silver Train\\"...This song seems pretty good.<br /><br />7.  \\"Hide Your Love\\"...This is one of my favorite songs, on this album.  I've always enjoyed listening to this song...I really think that \\"Hide Your Love\\" should have been a hit.<br /><br />8.  \\"Winter\\"...This song has nice wording & the music is VERY good, esp. on the strings.<br /><br />9.  \\"Can You Hear The Music\\"...In my opinion, I think that THIS is the very BEST song on this ENTIRE album.<br /><br />10. \\"Star Star\\"...This song seems pretty good.<br /><br />This \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" album is most recommended.  I've always enjoyed it enough to buy it again on a CD format.

B00008BXJG|4.0|This album could have had a 5 star review if it weren't for ONE particular song.  I bought this record orig. in October 1979 & then I bought the CD in May 2010.  I'm gonna review each song as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"Highway To Hell\\"...The TITLE TRACK, & love this song very much.  I remember, when I first heard this, on the radio in LATE September of '79.<br /><br />2.  \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\"...Another great & catchy beat, that I also remember from the radio, around the SAME time that \\"Highway To Hell\\" was being played.  I love this song a lot, too.<br /><br />3.  \\"Walk All Over You\\"...An EXCELLENT song w/ much faster beat.  I love this song a lot, too.<br /><br />4.  \\"Touch Too Much\\"...I love the sexy beat & words to this song.<br /><br />5.  \\"Beating Around The Bush\\"...Here is the song that really screwed up the album's chances to be a 5 star album.  It does contain a real fast pace, but this song never did OR never will cut it for me.  Definitely NOT my favorite on this album.<br /><br />6.  \\"Shot Down In Flames\\"...This song has real comical lyrics. I always got a big kick out of this song.  I love this song a lot, too.<br /><br />7.  \\"Get It Hot\\"...This is more of a passable song for me.  However, I like it a lot better than \\"Beating Around The Bush\\", though.<br /><br />8.  \\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\\"...This song also has a faster beat.  I think, that this song is pretty good.  This as also the title to their 1978 live in concert album.<br /><br />9.  \\"Love Hungry Man\\"...This song has a real suggestive beat & lyrics, a lot like \\"Touch Too Much\\" does.  I love this song a lot, too.<br /><br />10. \\"Night Prowler\\"...This song really stands out, on it's own, because of it's much SLOWER pace, almost like a ballad.  This song is wild & EXCELLENT for being so much different, from the rest of these songs.<br /><br />In 1979 & ESP. 1980, just before I bought the \\"Back In Black\\" album, I played the \\"Highway To Hell\\" album to death & I NEVER got tired of it. This albumwas the VERY LAST to feature Bon Scott on the lead vocals.  He died on February 19, 1980.  This album is always HIGHLY recommended.

B00479SVBU|3.0|I received the Soundfly AUX very quickly.  I was eager to use it and took it straight to the truck.  I had a SDcard with some music and a USB stick as well.  Setting the frequency was easy.  It only took a minute.  The Soundfly quickly read both devices and music was playing.  The sound quality using the FM transmitter is very good.  When the Soundfly is on though the other radio stations have static. I then used the audio out jack and plugged it into my audio in jack on my head unit.  This sounded even better.  Changing songs and albums is very easy.  If you want to listen to the radio the Soundfly does interfere with other radio stations causing static.  The Soundfly doesn't have an OFF button besides unplugging it.  All in all, it's OK.

B000002JAX|5.0|I can understand the criticisms of Madeliene being too much of a Billie Holliday impersonator.<br />But her cds do vary subtly in style, instruments and arrangements and the variety of material also gives her a different sound from song to song and cd to cd.<br />And then she sings beautifully in French.<br />La Vie en Rose has become more popular than it was originally. And Martha Wainwright and many others do it magnificently. Martha does a wide range of incredible Piaf renditions on her latest cd.<br />Nora Jones is a great stylist and the best known of this group of course, but Madeliene is more of a jazz singer per se.<br />Alicia Keyes is the Sarah Vaughn of this group. Powerful voice and a more commercial sensibility.<br />You won't hear Nora Jones and Madeliene doing hip hop thank God.<br />Amy Winehouse, along with Martha Wainwright, would have been the most original and adventurous of all of them.<br />The amazing Kat Edmonson is the most retro.<br />Listen on another cd for a beautiful rendition of Everybody's Talking (Harry Nilson sang it in the movie).<br />It is about as slow a song can be sung, but hypnotic.

B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I was cruising the new releases on-line and saw \\"The Way Life Goes\\" by Tom Keifer and decided to give a listen. It all sounded good so I bought the CD (that's what has always irritated me about buying albums is all the garbage they put in between the good songs but that was NOT the case with this one). The lyrics are meaningful,and the whole production is tight. Tom's voice is unlike anything I've heard before and there is a little bit of everthing from hard rock, to blues and even country-very Rolling Stonesish on a couple tracks. Curious who this guy is I did some reasearch and found Tom was front man for a metal band called Cinderella out of Philladelphia. They were first discovered by Gene Simmons of KISS and then Bon Jovi - both recognizing this super groups talent and both desperately trying to sign them. In 1986 they finally exploded out of nowhere with \\"Night Songs\\" that went gold in only nine weeks. I decided if they were good enough for John and Gene that was good enough for me so also purchased \\"The Best of Cinderella\\". My initial thoughts were Holy **** why don't the make music like this today and wish I had known about them sooner (definitely on a higher talent level other \\"Glam\\" bands from the '80s). Back to \\"The Way Life Goes\\"-LOVE IT and it sounds just as good as Cinderella but with alot more refinement and maturity. Can't wait to hear more from this guy and even better hear him live!
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|I like the choices of different tunes and artists.  This service is on at my convenience and I can pick out what andwho I want to listen to.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|So as soon as I got this app, I went to work using it. I have two computers at home: a laptop and a desktop. I do all my work on my laptop, but use the desktop for the internet and a different set of programs that are installed only on that machine. Sometimes for work, I have to research topics and write content for it (blogs, articles, etc.). So I hooked my Kindle Fire up to the laptop, and used it to write my document out, while I researched a topic on the desktop. The end result was great - I didn't have to write on the tablet then transfer, it was already sitting on my laptop to be edited. The only real grip that I had was that writing on the Kindle as opposed to the device its hooked up to can get a little messed up, or clicking on things, but for the most part is okay. The ability to zoom in, and have a keyboard on your tablet really does help. Swype also aids in a nice little productivity boost. Great app overall.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My first book from this author and I loved it! It read like a psychological thriller.  It's a bit difficult reviewing without giving away the plot twists. As an avid devoured of the thriller suspense genre, I often see plot twist coming from a mile away, however this book had me guessing and outraged and incredulous until the very end. Loved it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Thrilling with suspense makes me want to read more.<br />The Greek and roman sides are so very interesting. I can't wait to read the next book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love The Hunger Games Series!  Book 2 of 3 is now complete.  Loved One, lots of twists in number Two, what happens in Three?  I'll find out soon!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Been listening to it on repeat for a week now. This album hits all the right notes (pun fully intended).
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I understand that this movie messed up The Mandarin character and a lot of comic book fans are mad, but I really enjoyed this new film. Shane Black gives us a dark and comedic new tale in the life of Tony Stark. I thought this new film was much better than Iron Man 2. I love that it takes place around the Christmas holiday. I love the references to 'The Avengers' After almost dying in The Avengers, Tony Stark has been having panic attacks and nightmares. When Happy Hogan is injured during a Mandarin terrorist attack, Tony takes it upon himself to bring The Mandarin to justice. When his house is destroyed, JARVIS sends Tony to rural Tennessee where a Mandarin bombing happened. I loved the comedic one-liners and the witty banter between Tony and a 10-year old boy named Harley. If you love the Iron Man series, you'll love IRON MAN 3!!!
B003UESJHO|4.0|Its was good but not good as I thought it would be! I know it got several awards for this movie and I wanted to see it! It had too much about drugs and I didn't care too much for Christian Bales part! Not a good part for him!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The White Album (technically 'the beatles', but who ever calls it that?) is the most diverse and inconsistent release The Beatles ever put out. It contains some of the highest of their highs and the lowest of their lows, although even the lows would be highs for many other bands. Everything about it is contradictory, from the multitude of different styles to the range of emotions it provokes. At times the band seems to be breaking up before our ears, only for a brilliant piece of ensemble playing and singing to drag us back to the unity of earlier works. Opinion is divided as to whether this is a masterpiece to which every one of the 30 tracks is vital or whether it's a mixture of great, ordinary and bad material that needed an editor with a firm hand to draw it together. There's nothing like it in the whole history of popular music and perhaps that's just as well.<br /><br />By 1968 much had changed in the world of John, Paul, George and Ringo. Brian Epstein was dead, the band no longer played live, their success had given them power to control their own destiny to an extent which no other band had ever had before. Above all, they had grown up; even though they were still young men (on the release date, 22nd November- which coincidentally was exactly 5 years since 'With The Beatles' was released- Ringo and John were 28, Paul 26 and George 25) they were now adults and developing their own voices. If sometimes those voices weren't in perfect harmony, that was only to be expected.<br /><br />Rather than going track by track, I'll attempt to summarize each Beatle's contribution to the album as a whole. Ringo first: he makes his debut as a songwriter with 'Don't Pass Me By' and as a lounge singer with John's 'Good Night'. DPMB is a country song, pretty ordinary and not sung very well; opinions vary as to whether GN was intended as a parody or a serious lullaby. As a parody it's not funny enough and as a serious song Ringo doesn't sing it well enough. The White Album wasnot a happy experience for Ringo, who felt he was not valued by the other members of the group and even left for a period. Although the others pleaded for him to return and welcomed him back, his dissatisfaction can be heard in his relatively sparse contribution, even as a drummer. He does the job (except where McCartney does it instead, as on 'Back In The USSR'), but his flair is missing for much of the time.<br /><br />George was the peacemaker at this time. He decorated Ringo's drums with flowers and invited Eric Clapton to play the guitar solo on 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', not because George couldn't play it himself, but because Clapton's presence kept the band members on their best behaviour. George's 4 songs are all quality material and he probably warranted more representation on the album (he had written some good songs by then which had to wait for his solo albums to see the light of day), but he wasn't aggressive enough to insist on their inclusion and the others weren't objective enough to realize that his songs were better than some of those which did get included. However, WMGGW was a masterpiece, the first of George's great songs.<br /><br />John's songs were as all over the place as his personal life at the time. His marriage had broken up, Yoko had entered his life and he was frantically rushing in all directions. His contributions vary from the quiet and beautiful tribute to his mother (and also to Yoko) 'Julia' to the wild and experimental collage 'Revolution #9'. On the way he shows his gentle side in 'Dear Prudence' and his savage humor in 'Sexy Sadie' together with some raw cries of pain in 'Yer Blues' and 'Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey'. 'Bungalow Bill' is self-indulgent nonsense, but 'Happiness Is A Warm Gun' is a brilliant combination of 3 themes, previewing the second side of 'Abbey Road' and featuring the best ensemble playing on the album. John's contributions are a mess, but an intriguing and sometimes amazing mess.<br /><br />Which leaves Paul. By this time he had become the most prolific songwriter, but his lack of ability to edit himself, which became clear in his solo albums, diminishes his contribution here. He seems to have the idea that if he recorded it, that automatically made it worth including. The result is that the inspired simplicity of 'Blackbird' is dragged down by the lush over-orchestration of 'Mother Nature's Son' and the aggressive rock of 'Why Don't We Do It In The Road' is offset by the frankly boring 'Rocky Raccoon'. However, 'Helter Skelter' pointed the way towards metal and even punk and his whimsical 'Honey Pie' has charm. 'Wild Honey Pie', on the other hand, is just a throwaway, which ought to have been thrown away.<br /><br />The White Album is not the consistently brilliant set of songs which is a feature of The Beatles' best work. Nevertheless, it stands as a record of where the band was at that time. As such, it has a place in every collection; and at its best, it is very, very good.
B001NIAQ9I|4.0|is right here.  It's Barbra Streisand as Fanny Brice and you must have been living under a rock in 1968 when this film exploded if you hadn't heard anything about it.<br /><br />THIS is the defining moment of Streisand's career.  A voice angels would envy, a power bulldozers can only emulate.  She's that good.<br /><br />Sadly, after \\"Funny Girl\\", Babs chose to do a few musicals (\\"Dolly\\"/\\"Clear Day\\") and odd films (\\"Sandbox\\"/\\"For Pete's Sake\\") and all out ego-mania with \\"A Star Is Born\\" or the overlooked and under-rated and not-quite-so-bad \\"Yentl\\".<br /><br />But here, in \\"Funny Girl\\" is where the kooky girl leaves the kooky girl behind her and becomes a legend. After this film, the kooky girl was seen only rarely.  Yum.<br /><br />Very few actresses are so glued onto their roles.  Garland/Dorothy....Davis/Margo......Streisand/Brice.....<br /><br />The unwitting public (and yes, we are unwitting) have a wonderful tendency to stand up and take notice when a performer of true talent stands up and makes us take notice.<br /><br />A great film?  Not so much sometimes. It drags a little in the second half; a lot of long films do. Yet Streisand can do anything in this film for a film debut. She blows every other film debut out of the water.  Only comparison: \\"A Star Is Born\\" with Garland.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a wonderful book about a doctor who truely finds he can rise above his mental mind and that ther is so much more to what we are and why we are here.  People who read this should read some of Harold Klemp's books such as &#34;How to Survive Spiritually in OUr Times&#34; or &#34;A Modern Prophet Answers Your Questions about LIfe&#34; or Paul Twitchell's book - &#34;The Spiritual Notebook&#34;  These books help us understand even further who we are as Soul and what we are doing here on this Earth plane.  Dr. Alexander took a huge leap of conciousness and hopefully helped thousands of others do hte same. I would like to help too! There is SO MUCH MORE.
B000063V8U|5.0|I love the episodes in this season. The characters, the plot, the drama. It doesn't get much better than this!
0811874192|2.0|The pop up bouquets are cute, but the whole book looks cheaply made. I wasn't terribly happy with it, but gave it as a throwaway gift at a party. Its novel, but just not very good.
B000002KHF|5.0|I love this album so much this is the third time I had to replace it..into the mystic is one of my all time favorite songs of all..listen to all his lyrics of this album is just so soothing and happy music and it's just good for the soul type music..I highly recommend this album to all. the CD itself is flawless plays every time with no problem.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I really like this game. I find if sort of addicting. :) . However I do not want to use real money on it and certain aspects of the game can not really be achieved without buying more pearls or algae with real money.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|I bought this album for all the songs on both CDs are just incredible love the music, but the CD's itself not too happy with CD one right in the middle of my favorite song has a major skipping in it..cd2 plays just fine other than that was fast shipping I might be able to fix that scratch with a CD filler just haven't got a chance to try that as of yet.bummer!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome face on ice. The only things are switching between creative and survival and my favorite thing in minecraft:WOLF'S!!!!!!! I'm obsessed with this game so I can play at my aunts house. Thank you, Markus for creating Minecraft Pocket Edition!

B0082SU98U|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK!! I liked the movie Pollyanna, and that is why I decided to try the book. And this trial was rewarded tremendously!!! I loved how it was a lot like the book Heidi. This book is a MUST read!!!
0811879542|5.0|I have a couple of these books for my child care center.  The kids love to use it and it keeps them involved for some time.  The teachers asked me to buy more so they could have one in their classroom.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|This season was the best way to kick off the return of The Doctor with a whole new look and higher budget. The season is filled with twists and turns and the two part season finale always brings me to tears. Matt Smith is an amazing actor, and captivates me more than any of the previous Doctors. Something I always tell people, if you're not a HUGE sci-fi fan skip season 1-4 and the specials and just jump to Matt Smith, not only is he a new look be he is also a fresh start of sorts. Please treat yourself to a great show and cop this BLU-RAY only!
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Liked the book, but keep thinking:  &#34;this could be so much better&#34;.  I understand the point was the make the reader feel the isolation, but felt to well done at times.  Keep thinking I would like to see the reactions and story line on earth and Hermes.<br /><br />Also would have like more after the climax of the story.  Books just stops.<br /><br />Good weekend read.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|I'm not a huge Michael Jackson fan however as a DJ this CD has all the most requested tracks people wanna dance to. If you want a general collection of songs that are his fan favorites than this is the CD for you
B000VMBXNA|3.0|I enjoyed how the author tied the story together. It resulted in some thoughtful pondering about what I had just read.<br />It was a strange novella;  unlike anything that I have read before.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|The story line and the way it is told makes all the difference.  I found myself riveted to the screen as it all unfolded.
0316228532|2.0|I used this book to get me to sleep.  It had a lot of characters, who didn't do very much.  I couldn't finish it.
B003N7GATM|5.0|So refreshing to listen to complex, dark, powerful, electronic music that seems to represent the cutting edge well. One of the few albums I genuinely look forward to listening to and is truly ear candy.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Though I graduated from high school about 10 years before this movie was set, Perks brings up a lot of memories of my high school years.  Well acted and moving.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The only time this app work was when the tutorial was on, otherwise it wouldn't work on my kindle fire. Really disappointed.
0875428940|5.0|A beautifully designed and visually stunning deck.  A good deck for either beginners or veterans.  Great deck for use or just admiring the art.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I was was amazed that the Hobbit was so Boring - I kept waiting for the action to begin - a freiend was watching with me and fell asleep - not in keeping with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Takes a bit of time to grow on you, like most DM albums do, but the patience always pays off.
0307951529|4.0|\\"The $100 Startup\\" is a great read for a more contemporary business model. It's not your standard MBA style business read, which helped keep me engaged in the book. Chris Guillebeau does an awesome job outlining the step-by-step process of following this type of business. All the businesses sampled were not necessarily $100 start-ups, however, the same principles would apply and scale to a retail store or restaurant. Overall it was a great read and I definitely plan to reference this book on any new ventures I undertake.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies of my childhood! Every time that I want to remember of good times I watch this incredible movie.

B00BWBHIUG|3.0|its fun and good way to kill time - but it requires you to purchace items.  I just cant see paying more money to play a game.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I really enjoy the game and the level of words gives everybody a chance, but would like to be able to get more colors faster
B00008RV1L|2.0|I ordered the &#34;Uncut Version&#34; of this DVD, but got the standard edition with no special features, which is why I bought it in the first place. The display picture is of the uncut version, so I expect the same item to be shipped to me.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love the game it is fun -funny -and doable with several tries have recommened to friends The exciting things added make it fun have to really think about it
B003L77GRO|5.0|All great!!  I love the Dexter series.  Don't miss it.  they just keep getting better.  Love the characters, even though the acting sometimes is a little lame.
0316227706|5.0|I love the pictures in this book. They are too funny. Who doesn't love dogs, and funny ones at that!?
B000V86OKG|5.0|Don't miss this one!! Much better than the first season.  I can hardly wait for season three.  The coolest series around!  I can't stop watching once I begin.
B001NHNG64|2.0|Rather long winded and the story dragged longer than I could have hoped. The action scenes were pretty good, but there were parts of the book that I just rifled past. I'm going to give book 3 a chance and if it is similar, I may just skip the series all together.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dying to wait to see Season 7 after that great cliff hanger. The seasons get better and better.  Don't miss this one, it is absolutely fabulous.  A must see season!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The Amazon Photographer's camera backpack is loaded with features and space and is a great value for the money.  The bag rivals the name brands.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It is easy and perfect to write thoughts or notes on the go. Also I like the way I can copy a text from facebook or my Bible reading apps to create a Bible study.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I have no complaints whatsoever. They even come in a handy storage box. A great set to help you &#34;boldly go where no man has gone before.&#34;
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun game. You don't have to purchase stuff with real money to enjoy it, just patience. I do wish there were more challenges to do. Right now I am totally addicted to this game!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really like this story because it's so simple, so few characters (mostly one) and yet, so many details, problems and things are happening! There are almost no boring parts at all! you can't leave the book alone. Just can't. Mark Watney is one damn interesting character, and fun to read about! (Although I do find myself wondering how the hell he got the job, from the s*** he's saying..)<br /><br />I would say it's not a book for everyone. more of a book for people who knows a thing or two about physics and chemistry, or else they would just find the book full of information they are clueless about and a bit too technical. But mind you, it's supposed to be written from the point of view of an Astronaut...they are smart people.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to every person with a curious mind who could appropriate the many fine details which make the story so damn good. Well done!
B007N85POS|5.0|I've been hearing about 'angry birds&#34; for a couple years now, and I just played for the first time a couple days ago, and I'm addicted !!!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun app. Wish there were more ways to get pearls or no pearls.<br />Cool to make reef and see charracters from movies.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I'll bet it's there somewhere but the site is kinda cluttered and confusing...I just gave up and got a different app that's easier to use.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I like the case because it doesn't have the elastic corner bands that sometimes fall off.  The only thing I would change would be to have a zipper that completely enclosed the product like the one on my other Kindles.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the best book so far..loved it.<br />Christian and Ana have a baby and it is so adorable...Christian turns into such a softy..it's adorable!
B000VHMF0A|5.0|this album is good for anyone who wants some nice relaxing music. the songs are addicting and great to sing too
B003VS0CWY|5.0|This is an excellent copy of The Sound Of Music. Clarity of sound and a quality picture make for excellent viewing pleasure.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|I bought this set for my grandson, and he is crazy about it! He loves anything Legos, and I definitely didn't go wrong here!
0062515675|5.0|It is an inspiring book and contain hands on habits to become more in peace with yourself and your surroundings. I recommend it a lot and think that those tips and exercises your be thought in school to all our children, as they would benefit from the wise words.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|My favorite musical.  I watch it often although I am disappointed in some of the liberties that the film director took in deviating from the original stage version.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Great fun and a nice nod to the retro games, Well voiced and nice moral story fun for all ages
B005MHI0QM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Anne Frank was a very good writer and her diary provided indepth information about how her family dealt with their struggles.  A view of the war from the inside.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I got the upgraded version and it works AWESOME on my kindle fire. Also, it is easy to email notes from my KF to my gmail or wherever. This app is VERY user friendly and doesn't require a lot of work to set u (like none really). And unlike sticky notes which aren't very length writing friendly, this is literally a notebook(s) in the palm of your hand. And you can easily divide the notebook into categories of your title choice and email them to another location later if desired. Well worth the minimal cost for this full upgrade.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I loved this game on my brothers ipod but it was not avalible for kindle. Som  games make cheap knockoffs that are like the other game but are just to get your money. This is no  the case. The graphics are amazing , the updates are constant an  the software has no glitches.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Functional book with a lot of true ins and twists and turns...you must read this book. May the odds be ever in your favor
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great keyboard so far and love the Flow feature! Small learning curve.  Hopefully i get better at it over the next few days.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book provided a richer realm. Nonetheless, I believe, watching the TV series will enhance one's imagination while reading the book.
0061733199|4.0|I bought 2 different survival books for my emergency kit to be sure no one left anything out that I may need to know.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved this book, couldn't put it down! Such great details, feel like I'm there with the characters. Ready to read book 3 now!
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|This is a fun little game that can be played alone (against the computer) or against some friends. I recommend it.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I have been using the free version for quite some time, but low and behold, Amazon releases it in the appstore as the free app of the day. I'm haven't even considered looking for another timer app because this one suits my needs perfectly. I like that I can count down and set alarms as it means I finally stop over sleeping on the bus. The timers are also good for making sure my students stay on track. The only issue I have (and it's minor at best) is that I have to pick a picture if I want to customize a new category. Don't get me wrong, it's a good idea, but I don't like being forced to do so. All in all though I would recommend this app to any and every one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a very creepy book that gets in your head and is full of twists but kept me on the edge til the very end.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Amazon Kindle Fire needed a new USB Cable, it was still under warranty. A technician helped me solve the problem by sending the new USB Cable mentioned above. It arrived the next day, and really works well,I gave it 5 stars for quality and performance and if I could rate the Technician, it would be a 10, because he was so helpful, confident and courteous. Thank you,Amazon.
0061122416|5.0|I love love love this book!!!  Had it many years ago, loaned it out and never got it<br />back. Recently bought another one.  The second read is just a great as the first one.<br />One of my most favorites!!!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|ES File Explorer is a great way to store all your data into files that are simple and organized...It works great on my Kindle Fire HD...It makes it very easy to install/uninstall apps, game, etc that I don't want...I recommend this app to anyone who doesn't have it yet...

B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I liked the movie but I felt that the real legacy of Lincoln was overshadowed by another point. The movie focused a tremendous amount of dialogue and scenery to the legislative portion of the 13th amendment which abolished slavery in the Unites States. However, Lincoln's real legacy is that he fought to keep the union together. He staunchly refused any offer of truce or surrender that did not bring the southern states back into the union. His leadership in this conundrum of a civil war is the reason that the country as we know it exists today. He did many things during his tenure as the President of the United States and to focus so much on just one aspect of his presidency is superfluous and it really takes so much away from all the other great deeds that this man was responsible for.
B003QTBT5C|4.0|Again this album is typical of Apocalyptica with its heavy cello and drum elements but its more of a collaboration  with other artists then their own stand alone work.  Im more a fan of instrumental but still enjoyed the combination this album brought with it.  Would have liked to hear more of their older styles in this album but that does not mean it is bad, simply my own opinion.
B000WQW988|5.0|Ive been a Nirvana fan for years and this is the best! quality is great and the price was right. I watch it all the time!
B005R32L66|4.0|For being a compact means of logging onto skype or msn its a nice little app for your phone.  On occasion it has a habit of locking up or not letting you log back on.  A quick clear of the saved settings fixes that tho so its not a terrible problem if you know how programs work.<br /><br />Thats really the only complaint Ive had about it.  maybe making it possible to change the notification sound would be nice.  Its fairly quiet when its in your pocket.  Missed plenty of messages that way.<br /><br />Id recommend this to anyone that likes an easy to use method of staying connected on skype away from home.
140131046X|4.0|I had read this book and liked it, but don't know if my daughter will.  It seemed like a good book to give as a gift.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Loved this book. The characters were amazing and fit very well together. Fantastic ending wouldn't change a thing. A new favorite!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|My one and only concern is this Facebook thing. Yes I understand Facebook is popular,but what about people who don't have a Facebook. Other than that this is a really good app.
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|very well done, Excellent acting. Interesting concept of 6 separate story lines that are loosely connected.  Great fun for the actors having 6 different characters. I will watch this again.<br />The playing time shows up at something like 3 hours 45 min.  It is NOT that long - it like 2 hours 30 minutes and then has a bunch of extras at the end like the DVD, behind the scenes stuff.

030758836X|2.0|When I finished this book, I thought, \\"This book was written with a movie in mind.\\"  Even though the book is told from the minds or diaries of the two main characters, Amy and Nick, their thoughts were so predictably \\"missing person drama\\" that I found them banal.  The language is flat and artless.  The situation is straight from a TV drama like CSI.  The dramatic arcs seemed plotted, predictable.  Even though the story is told form the alternating minds of the two characters (through dairies, books), and enough clues and details are strewn throughout, the book feels to me like a sketch for a show, a screenplay with some adjectives and adverbs added.<br /><br />I blame the reviewer in Entertainment Weekly who loved this book.  I'm not saying that I could foresee everything that happened in the book (I didn't), but that everything which happened conformed to a version of what an exciting missing persons Hollywood drama would do, like Julia Roberts' movie \\"Sleeping with the Enemy,\\" or \\"The Hand that Rocks the Cradle.\\"  An initially appealing character is not who she seems to be.  In fact, not only is she not sympathetic, but every assumption is turned on its head, including peripheral characters like her parents, and other suspects.  Perhaps this is what is expected for a topical book.  Others will disagree, but I believe life is too short to read topical books.  That is to say, life is too short to read about two-dimensional characters who adhere to a plot that itself adheres to a blockbuster type of dramatic arc.<br /><br />To unfairly compare this book to one of real dramatic change: Cassandra Mortmain in \\"I Captured the Castle,\\" by Dodie Smith, is real the minute she writes, \\"I sit writing this in the kitchen sink.\\"  The book also has unpredictable, surprising turns, but the character development is so nuanced and complex that we feel completely sympathetic to the unorthodox circumstances.  Again, the talent of the writer is not in her subject, but in her words.<br /><br />The day I finished the book, I heard that the movie rights to the book have been sold.  Q.E.D.

B006OCM0G0|4.0|I play on my kindle &amp; sometimes I select challenges by mistake-like when I'm trying to click twice to prep or serve dishes. I wish there were varied dish prep times-maybe half orders or lunch options. Cuz the options for from a few min to a couple days...Like 8-10hrs for the longer prep times so it's convenient for when I'll be away from the game. There are some options, but not many. Also wish there were more furniture options for less than diamond prices! Other than that, it's fun &amp; love the different foods you can make!

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|We have already seen this and this purchase was to replace the original DVD that somehow disappeared.  This series along with The Band of Brothers is our favorites.  Time can pass after watching it once and you will want to watch it again.
0307279189|3.0|I think my title sums up my thoughts on this book. It was a good read but considering all the hype around this book I was expecting my mind to be blown, it wasn't. I did take some useful information from this read, it IS inspiring, but I got a little tired of pushing the barefoot shoe movement.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This is one of the worst books ever written.  (Besides her first one.) Written at a fourth-grade reading level.  Some of the most laughable and banal dialogue I've ever read.  &#34;Holy crap!  I clamber over to him as my inner goddess flushes.  Gah!&#34; Ridiculously horrible.
086571701X|5.0|The author says to read it from cover to cover. It took forever to really get down to the nitty gritty and I almost gave up on it. . The first two chapters were really repetitive and told you what it just told you and what it was going to tell you later on and was repetitive and told you what it just told you and what it was going to tell you later on. If you liked that last sentence you will like the first couple of chapters. If you skip the first couple of chapters you will probably be happier with the book.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Very repetitive, but easy to play and easy to learn. Fun when you want some mindless activity, yet addictive - leaves you wanting more.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this movie.  Tommy Lee Jones was very good as Dave Robicheaux, just the right amount of drive and control and some anger.  It's too bad this was only released as a DVD, I think it's missed by most people.  It's a tight little who-done-it, no explosions, no car chases.  The cinematography was great, shot on location in south Louisana.  You get the lush bayous, the sunsets on the water, gritty juke joints, shotgun shacks, and mansions.  We had no trouble following the story, as someone mentioned,  It's not fast-paced, just moves along as needed, as Robicheaux finds the little threads and clues and tries to bring them all together.  A very good performance by John Goodman also. Great supporting cast too.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|I really enjoy action movies with some type of a story.  However, I do like Expendables \\"just because\\".  So I might be a little biased in what kind of movies  I enjoy and how I rate them.  Besides I also liked Tom in \\"Days of Thunder\\" where you also saw Robert Duvall.  Although Robert has a small part in this one, he stands out.  Take a chance and you might be surprised especially if you like action with a little bit of a story thrown in for good measure.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Mytical.  You have never read a book like this before: manipulation of people and events with a wonderful storyline to include a love & hate story.

0452273331|1.0|If you have to get this book for required reading, looking out for a used copy may secure one closer to what it's worth.  Needless to say Rand (who was against any form of public support of education morally) should not by \\"virtue\\" of that fact alone, be required reading in any school curriculum.  Actually any \\"required\\" reading situation could be said to be a form of compulsion, so its supporters certainly should not be seeking to add it in any 'placement' as course demanded material - as that should run contrary to their principles.  However, it's the nature of Rand's beast to make exceptions for itself, and hold all others accountable as its real \\"purpose\\" - and standard \\"operating\\" (gutting) procedure.  This doesn't lessen the (badly pretended lack of) contradictions - it just serves to 'underscore' them - employing a term Rand tried to highjack in her redundancy maneuver.  The pretense comes together in her character of Howard Roark, who only has perfect structural, planning and design \\"ability\\" in typing on a page of paper -  only extending into cardboard within the cover of any hardbound copy of \\"The Fountainhead\\".<br /><br />In other words, it only \\"works\\" \\"logically\\" by \\"virtue\\" of the \\"fact\\" that it's non-existant.  The art department at Warner Bros. in 1949 did good and even excellent work (also in cardboard) for its day in bringing the fiasco 'to' apparent 'life', but this doesn't change the fundamental flaw and actual lapse of rationality that dresses itself up in the antithesis that is Rand's turnabout.<br /><br />The only architecture 'captured' in the film version as scenes of New York, incidentally, was that made by others.<br /><br />Attacking Rand though - for any purpose outside one's own - would be an exercise in futility.  Fortunately, eliminating her diktats (once alas ingested) -  as and for one's own reason/s and life and living - does release (and realize) a value;  the original one along with all others.  Her theories, literally on the (perpetually) other hand, as much as her attempted application to the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, were half-baked at best - and self-defeating at worst.<br /><br />In spite of the fact, her supporters will seldom be 'moved' from the faux-granite-like position they have been counter-trained to believe in as the greatest of all virtues.  Shame for most of them, it's as second-hand a gesture as the most vile fingering imaginable - by punks and house-tamed parrots - to idly copy and dully ratify.  Over and over.<br /><br />Speaking as an architect and builder, 'Rand' bears no relation to the subject, beyond her self-styled and reduced crash course for the purposes of highjacking it and gutting it to try use it as the 'means' to 'fit' her 'ends', and as such only stands up, provides structure, supports loads and  \\"holds [out] water\\" - or \\"works\\" - in paper.  A veritable house of cards, no less - and certainly no more.  Working with concrete, stone, bricks, mortar, wood, metal and glass - also composites and plastics (or PVC) in any good use, not to mention all related industries and attending professionals - requires far more understanding and far less dogmatic (and empty) posing.<br /><br />Philosophically, the same can be said of her work on paper - with even greater import -  as one that only would-be ever held against a living breathing human in attempt, and in contempt.<br /><br />Further thoughts as comment (1) below, if interest extends.<br /><br />Gratuitous \\"No\\" voting in which the objecto-collectivists may engage changes neither the facts nor (negates) the review.  In this case such voting registers nothing but a count of voided minds and stands for the many who seem to take pride (or refuge) in all thinking and feeling the same way -  exactly.<br /><br />* Any periodically inflating figures are the tools (and ploy) of hiding stagflation and only serves the few actual parasites within objectivism's tree who still may have vested interests in preserving the image of Rand - measured in $, which they forever try to put over as the ultimate virtue.<br /><br />** Specially referencing any school forced curriculum inclusion or use of what amounts to no more or less than a propaganda offering - which is what I'm certainly against - on, in and with principle - as much as (and more than) Rand was \\"morally\\" against any public form or support of education of any kind.

B00992CF6W|4.0|It is a great app for the first week. It's amazing. But then it starts to bore you. Survival mode is horrible. But you end up making a lot of worlds and it's cool. To pause you have to tap the screen. Than a little black tab will appear. Tap it and hit the back arrow.
B009JZTP4Y|4.0|I loved this series since its inception..it was the first tv series at least to have decent special effects and the stories were compelling.They brought all that plus some very good effects for this first time out,plus a good story line.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Want to exercise your heart?  Why do aerobic, when you can watch the Walking Dead?  My heart rate was so elevated with this Season, I had to take breaks.  I was so freaked out, I found myself watching the televison from the threshold of the door on more than one occasion.  I just could not be in the same room.<br />I loved Season 1 and Season 2 is just as good.  Season 2 gives us more drama between the characters and the viewer is allowed to get to know them all.<br />I think I am a fan for life already.  Nothing on television compares.
B005PK56TA|1.0|This kind of stuff is not for me. I only looked at it out of courisity I won't be looking at this kind of trash
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Yeah, I keep telling myself this, but I still can't watch this program after dinner.<br />Walking Dead Season 3, what to say?  It is like looking into the heart of darkness as we watch each of the characters we have grown to know turn to baser instincts to survive after the full collaspe of society.<br />I've watched each episode with trepidation, as I did with seasons 1 & 2.  But in Season 3, the characters have an edge to them that slowly builds terror inside of the viewer.<br />Season 3 was a heart pounding, stomach turning experience that left me with only one question.... What do I do with myself until February?
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I learned my lesson when movies were video cassettes and I stacked them and then packed them, when DVD's came in.  Now I am very particular which movies I buy, but I have both of the Downey Sherlocks, and look forward to collecting the next one that he and Jude Law are in.  I recommend this movie whole heartedly to anyone who loves period films and the master detective, Sherlock Holmes.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I had never seen a single episode of The Walking Dead.  Then, on my last visit to Arizona, my lovely daughter suggested we do a marathon from the beginning of the show.  By episode 3,  I was begging her, &#34;No more please.  I can't take it.  It is too intense!&#34;  She tortured me with one more episode and then sent me home to Illinois.<br /><br />Upon my return, I jumped right online and purchased Seasons, 1, 2 & 3.  This is definitely a series I want to own.  ALWAYS.  The writing is great. It is loaded with action and peppered with just a little humor to ease the tension.  I love it.  Although, I am limiting myself to 3 episodes per week so that I can sleep at night.  Hey, the suburbs are scary.  It's pitch black out here.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I play so much that I just received a pop ad for a singles site-- guess &quot;they&quot; think I need a life! Love playing this Spider.

B0007TKNII|5.0|Beautiful love story, we loved everything about it.<br />Enjoyed the music, the storyline, great all the way.<br />We would recommend, a must see.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|It was very interesting to see who they were associated with early on.  If you like the Eagles, you will love this DVD!!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|It was a bit slow-going & it is more for the young adults. simple plot, entertaining, but was waiting in vain for the excitement to begin.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you like to be challenged then this is a perfect game for you. The game gives you a limited number of hints per test, but it is more than enough if you get stuck. I only had a couple of times where the controls did not do what I wanted. Though it was not enough to frustrate me. The game is well worth the two follies, but it does feel like it needs to be longer. I hope that the makers of this game will release a version that contains all of the chapters. Until that happens, I can't wait for the next chapter to come out.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A funny novel for kids that's very enjoyable there is always something new happening I just could not put the book down
B0082Z447U|4.0|Only gave it 4 stars because I had a hard time reading Walter's part (the first epoch). Great Story. Yes, a little predictable for our time, but I suppose that at the time it was written, it was very controversial. You always want to know what will happen next. I enjoyed reading the story from the many characters point of view. A Classic must read.
B0079TQHDO|3.0|It was a good yarn, however I am struggling to write fifteen words about this Jeffrey Archer book. Easy to read providing you don't want to engage too much grey matter.
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|The concert everyone waited for... and they still sound as good as ever!  I love the new intro to Hotel California.  The acoustic set is my favorite part of the DVD.  Everyone nails their parts, and Joe Walsh (my personal favorite) still has his chops.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|My daughter had me order this show for her and I fell in love with it from the beginning. Who knew I would love the zombie apocolypse? It was shipped and recieved in a timely fashion with no problems.
B002RVZV9U|4.0|If you like to pay guitar, then you have to see these 3 guys sit around and chat about the instrument that they have used to change people's lives.  I don't like &#34;The Edge&#34; a lot, but I can tolerate him in this video.  Jimmy Page is amazing, and Jack White is very interesting.  You will find yourself watching this again and again!  It has plenty of replay value!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|My daughter had me order this show for her and I fell in love with it from the beginning. The second season is just as good, if not better, than the first. I can't wait for season three. It was shipped and recieved in a timely fashion with no problems.
B00006G8G1|3.0|I like Maiden- don't LOVE them, I LIKE them.  This is a pretty good DVD.  Lots of good music, plenty of cool shots of the band, etc.  If you need some metal in your concert collection, this would fill the space nicely.  My favorites are &#34;2 Minutes to Midnight&#34; and &#34;Run to the Hills.&#34;
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|It's a powerful movie which my family and I enjoyed and have watched many times since I purchased it!  It's a shame the way we humans treat one another, especially if we look different from you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is a lot fun for any age group. It's very cute with good graphics and it is just like the movies.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I have wanted to watch this movie ever since it came out.  Okay, I'm too cheap to get a Netflix membership, too lazy to go to a DVD store and am VERY patient.  So when I saw this movie could be rented and downloaded right to my computer for less than three bucks, I popped up the popcorn and enjoyed a great flick with the expected wonderful acting by Liam Neeson and crew and the typical suspense/good guy rocks factor. Pretty predictable as a movie goes, but still well worth my pittance paid out for it.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very involved with many things to do and collect. I can foresee hours of fun and enjoyment. Visually stunning and unique. The opposite of boring.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Insightful, breathtaking masterpiece. Jessica Chastain is our new Meryl Streep. Should have copped the Oscar for best picture, best actress, best script, and best director.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have no idea why this book is still on the best seller list.  The story line starts to prove interesting about half way through the book, but fizzles out at the end.  I was disappointed in the final resolution.  It has a surprising plot twist, but none of it is very realistic.  I would not recommend this book and regret my purchase of it.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|I got this to print from my Kindle Fire I was able to print some things as a test but since then I haven't been able to figure out how to get it to print what I want it to. I will just have to try harder.
B0010X745K|4.0|The Mist was a very good movie. It had a lot of edge of seat moments in it and had a lot of unexplainable creatures and horrors hiding in the mist. While the townspeople were trapped in the store you wonder how they are going to get out of their situation and if the creatures are going to get in. You wonder if any of them are going to get out alive. One man tries to calm them and keep them in the store, but they all turn on him until they start dying one by one. They movie is good up until the end. The ending totally sucked. I would recommend this movie. Check it out for yourself.

0385349947|1.0|Within first few pages, she quotes the tired old lie that women get less pay (70%) for same work and capability. How idiotic! If that's the case, why doesn't she hire all women staff and pay them 80% of what she'd pay men? Women workers would get 10% more and the company would save 20%. Companies who discriminate against women would lose 20% in profit and promptly go under. Obviously, this doesn't happen. This is demonstrated by a company set up by former ERA member; he set up a company and tried to hire all women so that the cost would be 20% less than the competitor while still giving higher pay to his employees (women). This obviously didn't work.<br /><br />There are fewer women in top paying jobs, because they are paid more than men. She demonstrates this by her pregnant women parking. Instead of finding her own way of getting it done (temporary handicapped placard, for example), she goes to her boss to \\"request\\" special parking spaces near the offices. Something like this would cost few tens of thousands of dollars which no man would ask for. In addition, this is yet another thing for a boss to worry about on top of everything else. The true cost to the boss is more than the actual capital outlay, and that remains in his mind for all women. For him, women get paid more than men when all benefits are included, so he'd be less likely to hire women in the future. And if he were to hire women, he'd pay them less to offset the additional fringe benefits he may have to provide in the future. This may not always happen consciously, but it is there somewhere in his mind.<br /><br />But that's not wholly true, either. Women of equal productivity and negotiating skills get paid just about the same as men and enjoy the fringe benefits, too. Key word here is negotiating. If women demand fringe benefits like pregnant women parking, that takes away from negotiating points. If she produced the same as her male peers, her ability to ask for higher pay is reduced by the fringebenefits she's been enjoying.<br /><br />Labor statistics do not show the ability and productivity between men and women; they go by superficials such as years on the job and education level. There are better studies that show the difference is negligible, and slightly in women's favor. Include all the fringe benefits and mandates (such as maternity leave), and the women are paid more than men. How much more? Market place would dictate that. As the cost of fringe benefits for women get higher, lower their salary would seem and fewer their prospects for high level positions. Adding government mandates to supposedly help women in work place actually hurt women. In the long run, things like special pregnant parking she implemented hurt more women than help.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I would love to have more women in workplace. If I could work my job at a place with all women, I would love that. As a hetero male, I really do love women. But with additional costs, it's just not practical for a business to incur the extra cost over having male workers.<br /><br />It's scary what kind of nonsense woman MBA in high position has. With stupid belief like this, is it any wonder why more men get to high level positions than women. Until women drop their entitlement and victimhood mentality, they will always feel like getting less pay and actually have fewer positions of power.<br /><br />[Edit 2014-04]<br /><br />Since Obama's attempt to push more lawsuits by \\"pay gap\\", more information has become public. White house \\"pay gap\\" is 88%, then they go to explain that the gap is due to different types of jobs and experiences. Labor stats show that women get paid 93% to 95% of men when similar criteria is applied, not 70% that Sandberg claims. This does not count latent benefits for female employees (demanding pregnancy parking for example) that do not exist for men nor the aggressive negotiating salaries that men do.<br /><br />When Obama's \\"pay gap lawsuits\\" become more widespread, I suspect more companies will shun female employees. After all, why should they hire females, give them more women-only benefits only to have much higher risk of lawsuits filed?<br /><br />Even in light of these facts, Sandberg does not back down from her \\"pay gap\\" viewpoint as recent interviews show. Well, if she chooses to ignore the facts and live in fantasyland, that's her prerogative. But I hope women recognize what is really going on, and not buy into having laws that will make jobs even more difficult for women.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This app is totally awesome! Building your own park is very fun. The dinosaurs are cute, the missions are fun to complete, it's just wonderful. The underwater park is cool too. My one complaint is how much everything costs if you don't actually buy the money. But the game is well worth a download. I'd say definitely get it. It's so simple my six year old brother can play it, and he has a lot of fun.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|I first saw Downton Abbey in a video set lent to me.  I was captivated with it from the start, and found it necessary to stay up late nights just to see \\"one more\\" segment...<br />So captivated was I that I had to order the three seasons for my own so I could watch again and again as I know I will.<br />I've never seen anything like this saga where the actors so perfectly fit the roles that they play!  As each segment progresses to the next, it is impossible to not get caught up in the characters' lives.  You'd think that with so many characters and subplots that it would get too complicated for continuity's sake, but the opposite is true.  Each subplot fleshes out the story so that it flows smoothly and continues to spark interest in outcomes.  By far the very best to come out of England yet.  Buying the set will provide me with wonderful entertainment over and over again. Now I look forward also to the new season.
B0012HRJEA|4.0|I liked Romeo + Juliet because Baz Luhrmann chose to stay true to the original Shakespearean text while adding modern art and cinema concepts.  Montagues and Capulets were represented as warring empires in Verona Beach and swords were replaced with guns.  Shakespeare would have liked this version of one of his most famous works because it stayed relatively true to the events in the play.  The true emotions, beautiful cinematography and soundtrack in Romeo + Juliet made up for any scenes that may have seemed \\"shaven down\\" compared to the play.  This version also preserved the original meaning of the language used in Shakespeare's time that might have been lost had it been translated to modern speech.  Overall, I think Luhrmann did a good job of accurately reworking Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet while effectively catching the audience' attention.
B0019CB5T8|5.0|Loved this movie.. Traditional demon possession movie flick, almost as good as 'The exorcist'.. Great addition to my horror collection.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm a child of the 80s and this book took me back to my childhood. Although I wasn't really into video games, I don't think it took anything away for the pleasure of immersing yourself into the world that Ernest Cline created for you. The story was well thought out and engaging. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|My wife n I love this game.<br />We are 23 n 25 yrs old, and we are pretty busy working .<br />But when we get home this game relaxes us.
B0013D6LEM|4.0|I remember listening to Michael Jackson's music when I was younger.  His music is timeless and classic because everyone loves to listen to it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is the best book I have ever read it was so amazing...best book in letter form I really want to see the movie now because this book was beyond great!!! I recommend strongly!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son loves planying Temple Run 2 on my phone and ipad.  I have played it a couple of times as well; however, my video game skills are lacking.
1608871452|5.0|This gem is a steal for this price. It has everything a fan could want: high-quality photos, pull-out goodies, interviews, behind-the-scenes information, speculations for the future (it was published before season 8), stickers, posters, and more.<br />I am extremely satisfied with this purchase; it came in excellent quality and with much more than I expected.<br />Any Supernatural fan would love this book and I give it the highest of recommendations.<br />If you're thinking about buying this and are not sure about such a purchase, buy it. Trust me; you want this.
B00006AW63|1.0|This DVD is not compatible with American computers or DVD players.  Do not buy if you live in the States.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|this may be the only youtube app for the kindle fire, but it doesn't work right, I'm constantly finding my videos skipping randomly even when they are fully buffered and when I try to type something in it has double letters! its quite annoying so please fix this app!
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|Great beginning to a good series. Starts slow but pay attention. I'm on book three now and I'm still loving it.
B0098460O4|5.0|Beautiful voices; good sound quality, solid packaging.  My wife saw it on UK has Talent and HAD to have it
B000KOZMUE|4.0|I use this external flash with a Nikon D3100. It works well. It is limited in light output, and the lamp can only be adjusted vertically, not horizontally. But for me, and, I think, for typical amatuer photographers, it does the job.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I loved this series growing up as a kid watching with my father and now I can watch them whenever I want. Great having all of the films together in one collection.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I don't follow directions well, so I was relieved to read words that were written with step by step instructions.  Kindle formatting can be intimidating, but I  now have hope I will succeed.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is such a fantastic film and can't wait for the new one!! Will enjoy this DVD over and over again.
B009R659L8|5.0|She always writes so you do not want to put the book down.  She is my favorite author, Mary Higgins Clark,
0131480057|5.0|Looked in this book after going through about 4 other of my references and ended up reading the whole thing.  It's great reading and great reference.
0307595862|5.0|I had heard that this story was slow and hard to get going - but I enjoyed iit from start to finish!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I don't read many crime novels but this one was recommended to me and I could not put it down.  The case was apparently complicated but as is often the case started with a common crime that proved to be much more than it seemed.  The interspersed story line of father and daughter strife CSS love is the story of my life as well.  I liked it on many levels and I will be checking out more if the author's work
B00AHXIC50|3.0|The music is fun but not quite as upbeat and bouncy as I thought it would be going by Locked out of heaven.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|This is quality metal. The previous singer was good on \\"The end of Heartache,\\" but after that I just wasn't feelin' him. This album really has punch. And I like it lyrically. It's something the younger and older hardcore kids, metalheads whatever can get into. The new (old) singer really has some great range.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Great directors and great actors, with great technical accuracy, make this series a reference to the movie lovers of WWII.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|An eclectic group of musicians brought together for an amazing show, unlike any Joe you've heard before. While Acoustic guitar is not his normal medium, he handles the transition nicely. I purchased this after watching the concert video on PBS, and have not been disappointed.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Really loved the setting and the authors desciptive writing.<br />The only draw back was that the language didn't seem as though it fit with the time period.<br />But with that said I would highly recommend this book.
B001G50SLE|5.0|I honestly don't remember buying this. I think I bought one episode. I'm sure it was fine though. The end!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So far it works great. I especially like the large keys. very easy to use. If you have a need for a easy to read and use calculator , this is it.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|I honestly don't remember buying this one either. I think I bought one episode. I'm sure it was fine though.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|If I was to compare the old version to the new version, only the new \\"Charlie\\" would be an improvement over the old cast.  I was very disappointed overall - Depp does a good job but is not a patch on Gene Wilder.
B004JZBGWI|2.0|This is an item that some may really like and find useful.  Unfortunately, for me, I felt like it was just an electronic version of being disorganized and having little post-it notes everywhere.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie and the only thing really preventing me from giving a full five stars is the rather unnecessary diversions from the actual text - it is a mystery to me why moviemakers cannot resist tinkering!  That said, I thought Martin Freeman did a great job.
B0087EACJK|2.0|This was more annoying to me then fun and challenging, but that's just me. Others might enjoy this game very much
B00A83075M|5.0|This has to be the most original concept for a kids movie since Monsters Inc. - quite a nostalgic movie for those of us that remember the 80s - highly recommended!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book especially when they say that one of Gregory's best friend has a crush.<br /><br />I hope that James Patterson makes another book so I can see how his and his friends turn out.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|Science fiction and comedy makes a very good combination.  Similar to the Star Trek  Movies which we all know and love.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Using it with headphones for my 3DS and what a difference it's making!  Highly recommended, wouldn't hesitate for a purchase
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Rolling in the Deep, Set fire to the Rain, and Someone like You are my favorite songs onthis album. Adele has such an amazingly beautiful voice!!!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I've read plenty of review on this series already and I have to say that I can agree with the both the good things to say about it an the bad.<br />The world that the author pulls you into is masterfully created and includes a multitude of different cultures and societies in which to fill it. Characters are well thought out, leave lasting impressions and are easy to make connections with. And while it seems that the story moves by slowly, it still traps you within its pages. I can't wait until the third comes out!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very fun game. It is also family friendly. The kids also seem to love this game. I've had no trouble from it
B00A77II0U|5.0|it was a very fun game. creepy, ridiculous, and fun. I only get maybe twenty minutes a day to play, so it took me a few days to beat it. I like these types of games and it was a good one so that's why I gave it five stars.
B00005JKHN|5.0|The DVD arrived quicker than expected and in great condition, as promised. The whole family loves this movie (kids age 5 and 2.5) There are some scary parts, but we watch it together and hug/hold hands for that : ) The fairies are the best part for me,  and provide some good comic relief. Beautiful movie!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It's a pretty good game, and if you like games about catching animals and crossbreeding them to make Gryphons or Pegasuses, this a game for you! Great graphics.... it takes no skill to play this game, though.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|You have to have a facebook account to play it i do not trust sites like that so i guess<br />People without facebook can't play thats so unfair.LAME
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Great Entertainment! I enjoyed being able to watch the whole trilogy. Good fun dinosaur action, some parts a little cheesy but overall GOOD.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I liked this game is very relaxing and easy at least until you get to the nine by nine's it would be smart to get this free game
B000BISBDY|5.0|Great CD with almost all the songs being previous hits by the man in black. I believe the last two songs are from his last performances around the time his wife died.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Great product. I have a two year old and before this product I was using the old fashion broom all day. But with the cordless sweeper it eliminates the old fashion broom and dust pan. Great invention I'm ordering one for my mom and sister.
B00013M6NK|5.0|my camera. i love my camera. but often, i kill the battery and then it takes forever to charge.  i bought this wall charger and extra battery. now i am set! i dont have to worry about toting around a dead camera with this perfectly convenient charger and extra battery.  it even comes with a car charger.  i havent had to use that yet but i have used the heck out of the wall charger and extra battery.
0062197266|5.0|This book was kind of difficult to read back and forth, but now I see that it was the best way to write to story. I was up until late at night to finish this one. It kept my interest the entire time and I was so invested in the characters.
0761169253|5.0|I love it, inspirational, even I'm not an artist, this book gets deeply into solving the question What should I be working in to be really happy? Tough question. Austin very sincerely grabbed what he thinks it necessary for us to know about his life and ideas he has been collecting, and give them to us trying to make us get closer to the answer of the question.
1932735410|5.0|I passed on my first try after about a month of studying. I spent about 95% of my study time on this book.  I highly recommend it.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|It was rather boring after about 59 seconds. I thought it would be entertaining for my granddaughter but it really wasn't.
B009AMANBA|5.0|All be it that there were some creative licensing liberties taken. This movie bought to life the turmoils of one of America's most prolific crisis in our history.
044024238X|5.0|Kinsella keeps making me sooo happy every time she writes a new book! The only sad thing abut this book is that I did not wanted it to over! You get so consumed in the story that you can't stop reading!! I laugh so hard and enjoyed it so much as her other books! Really recommended. She knows what she writes and how to do it.
B006VFLIYK|1.0|At first I thought this was going to be a great and exciting book that I purchased before a trip. THEN a fourteen year old character shows up and I knew everything would be taking a bad turn. A guy is a hired assassin and now we have a 14 year old entering the story. We just POPPED the balloon of intrigue and hired assassin excitement. The dialogue was pure bad movie dribble. Oh, and as Robie 'padded across the floor'-- padded across the floor? Really? Give me a break. Who the hell 'pads' across the floor? Using pads, I shined the floor. But 'padded'? I began groaning out loud. One groans before one throws up. I didn't care about anyone in the story. Why oh why bring in a fourteen year old character? She should have been sent to some juvenile detention center for extremely annoying characters. As I was reading this on a plane, I wanted to either jump off without a parachute or flush it down the toilet. As I was going to a family wedding-- I needed to stay on the plane. Also, it's on Kindle-- I couldn't flush it away. It wouldn't fit down the airplane toilet. No matter how much suction that toilet has for pulling waste out of the bowl, I couldn't ride myself of this book. This was one waste I knew that the BLUE WATERS--- (Blue Man is a character name? Let's play lousy name game-- Blue Man. You win) of an Airbus toilet couldn't get take away. I decided not to read it on my trip. Arriving back at work a week later, a coworker told me to give it time. I did. I read faster and faster and it was still unbearable. My coworker- Redman(again, not his real name)- told me to wait some more. I did. It didn't help. Redman's (one more time, not his real name)beautiful Mom (not his real Mom, whom I've never met, but she must be a beautiful Mom) passed along the suggestion that I give the story more time. I did that for Redman's beautiful mother (again, not his real name nor his mother but she must be beautiful) -- but with great difficulty. I thought about killing off the annoyingcharacters myself-- skip any dribble they were uttering. That didn't help. I 'padded' across my Kindle and finished the book. Whew. That was an ordeal. It took me all of the skills Will Robie has but without the use of an arsenal of weapons or umpteen safe houses in which to hide from this book. So, the book won. But I get to DELETE it from my Kindle. I get to MAKE IT GO AWAY.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game is so fun and adicting. i love it so much. the only problem is that it takes a little long to load
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I enjoyed the dialect and the main characters.  Other than that, the book was very unsettling.  I found it unbelievable that there were so many cruel and heartless human beings,let alone priests and nuns not so long ago.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would highly recommend this book! I will be checking out some of the author's other books as well :o)
0783240287|5.0|Just like the Canadian cast CD this video is a great version of this wonderful musical.  The sound was great and I had no problems with it.  The London cast version , on the other hand, is very disconcerting with huge dynamic variations, and periods of silence.<br />This DVD is definitely worth buying!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was better than the first! I literally could not put it down! Can't wait to start the third one!
B0000024YL|5.0|Simon & Garfunkel wer always one of my favorites and this album does not disappoint.  I love to sing along with them.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love this movie! I have watch it so many times and each time I cry because it touches my soul. The acting, the music, the story fills you with so many emotions. I find myself humming the songs. I haven't felt this way about a movie in a long time. No matter if you saw this in a theater, you much buy the DVD.
B000001IQH|5.0|This is a great album.  Most of what Rancid does is great and they have always had a great sound.  This album exemplifies their sounds, musics, and lyrics.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Every Muse album has a completely different sound.  This is definately their heaviest (check out &#34;Hyper Music&#34;, &#34;Plug In Baby&#34;, & &#34;Citizen Erased&#34;!!!).  It's my 2nd favorite, just after The Resistance.<br /><br />BTW - Don't worry, the CD label is supposed to be all white.  It's not a bootleg  :)
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The movie got me so pumped, when i got home and saw this in Amazon's appstore i practically flipped out. It's really fun I'm gonna recommend it to all of my friends!
B00005JPSM|5.0|A very emotional movie about a topline chef (Catherine Zeta Jones) having to adopt her sister's daughter (Abigail Breslin) after the sister's death in an auto crash (A la Raising Helen).  Forced to take timeoff from her job to take care of the daughter now hers played brillinatly by Breslin, a rising chef, played by Aaron Eckhart, dare sot come into &#34;Her kitchten.&#34; Tempers flare, egos are changed, and love wins out in this complicated story that makes you &#34;hungry&#34; for more.
0920668372|3.0|I like the story in this book. I seen this book at K-mart's. I did not buy it then. I ordered it on Amazon and it was a misprint....the last few pages were repeats of the previous pages and I plan on trying to get the book replaced with another one that is correct. This story reminds me of my sister in law and my nephews. Who each have a baby girl. The story makes me think of them and I want to give them all a copy, but, only a correct copy-not a misprint. I think they will like the meaning behind the story as I did.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Wow! Do Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer play incredible characters in another true story about a Vatican priest saving countless allied former prisoners or airmen shotdown in WWII Italy. A true story, the cat and mouse game between Peck's noble priest and Plummer's cruelNazi occupation commander is supereb. A very good cast fills in with memorable characters themsleves. An absolutely powerrful ending--and second ending.
B00005JKDR|3.0|The disc I received had a scratch and It ruins the flow of the movie. I in general like the movie, It's very funny and interesting. If the disc didn't have a scratch on it, I would have rated it 5 stars.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This movie may be too ingenious for some folks to follow. There was not ONE scene that I didn't find something to laugh about. You really just have to pay attention - even just the facial expressions in some scenes will provoke a giggle. The bad reviews , in my opinion, are just short sighted. If you are 40 or over, you will DEFINITELY see the humor in every minute of this movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I chose this rating because it was a great film which had great &#34;extras&#34; in it. I enjoying watching the extra scenes.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I was very disappointed with this CD. All the other ones, and I own them all, have had all the power and emotion that has made Michael Buble my favorite artist.
0525478817|5.0|I love this book. It will make you laugh and cry and give you a better understanding of the world.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book very much and couldn't put it down until I was finished.  Breaks at work, the bathtub, wherever.  I wasn't going to stop until I'd reached the end.  Love Hugh Howey's stuff.  A great read.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Second season of Game of Thrones on Blu-ray.  You know nothing, Jon Snow. Winter is coming. The king in the North!
B006ATJXQW|3.0|Not as good as the series and I expected more answers. I enjoyed the flashbacks but felt the details should have been more revealing.  Loved the characters though and recommend anyone who reads the series should definitely read this.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Nice quality movie over the internet at HD!  Not too much more you could ask for, smooth and crystal clear
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game I awesome. I would recommend this to everyone.I play this almost everyday.And its free.So I would get it if I were you.
B00CLH1PHM|4.0|Duncan Whitehead has done it again with delightful short story with a quirky darkness that keeps you reading to see how the story will twist and turn. The tale of actor Terry Sparkes will touch a nerve. The If onlys of the story demonstrate the old choices and consequences path of the actor's life which I think all people can relate to.I had the pleasure of reviewing Duncan's novel, The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club which is referenced in this dark morality tale of an actor's life. I recommend this short tale and Duncan's [[ASIN:B00AHHODH2 The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club]] to anyone wanting to read a great new author.
1574216988|4.0|I'm happy with this book, but it didn't give me as many ideas as some of my other books.  Still, there were quite a few patterns I didn't have from other sources.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|It was so sad, that since I live in Mexico City, I could not watch the movie online, since I am not allowed to because of the region. That's why Amazon Prime seems only good for US-residents.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I chose this rating because this book is truly a great one. The imagery in it is phenomenal. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the TV series because it provides quite a bit of back story that you just can't get out of the series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|so engaging from character to costume.  i was hooked from the first moment i started watching.  i suggested this show to people all the time
0316286850|5.0|I gave this book to my God Daughter when it first came out in 1997.  As teenagers can be, one of her thoughtless friends stole it.  It was wonderful to see her face at her Bridal Shower when she unwrapped it.
1594484805|5.0|Excellent book to spark thought and debate! I plan on using some of the techniques when a situation calls for it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Excellent read. Inspiring and profound. Demonstrates the amazing strength of the human spirit. I will definitely read it again, and recommend the story to everyone.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|This video is great for all ages and is breathtaking.  The picture and audio in HD are absolutely stunning if you have never seen this performance live buy this and you will want to as it is only better in person.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|This is the old version of Talking Tom! You need to put on all of the other talking friends apps on the Amazon App Store. For example Talking Tom 2, or Talking Been, or Tom & Been News. Thoes are my favorite apps on my mom's iPad, but I want them on my Kindle, but I can't find them on my Kindle store.<br />  I was just about to send this with two stars, but then I remembered that Tom won't talk when I do. I don't blame Talking Friends on this problem. I have  a regular Kindle Fire, witch has no Mic.. If it did, I'd definitely download any Talking Friends App I could get on the Amazon App Store, if they were even on there.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|I am really glad that the movie was free with my Prime Membership because I would have been upset it I'd purchased it. The film's language was crude and the plots were a little on the raunchy side.  The fathers in this movie look like men who are trying to find a meaning to their lives after becoming dads, like they'd lost their manliness or something. You can guess the outcome for every couple and there is no originality to their plots. Don't waste your money.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Life of Pi was an interesting story about what starts out as a boy's spiritual journey, and morphs into his struggle for life.  The visuals are beautiful, and make it easy to see why Rhythm and Hues was awarded an Oscar for their work.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Pogo cable charges quickly and prevents my dogs from knocking my tablet of the table! If it gets pulled on its simply disconnects. Great for people with kids and pets. It also gives the micro USB port a break.
B008602KQI|1.0|I postponed watching this film for quite a while, but finally watched it; it was every bit as awful as I feared it would be.  I simply cannot believe that this is what passes for teen inspiration and role models today. Oh, wait a minute: yes, I can believe that our bloodthirsty culture industry will peddle this kind of crap to passive consumers. The messages contained in this film are horrifying: who on earth came up with the idea that kids killing kids creates winners and heroes? Sounds like a great idea for terrorists...<br /><br />In my mind, there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this franchise, and I think the book author and everyone involved in this project are monstrous in that they greedily inflict these messages on teenagers: winning at any cost is good; killing bad teenagers is good; resistance is futile but noble in some pathetic way (as long as you still smile and wave for the camera); and ultimately, give the authorities what they want.<br /><br />TEENAGERS MURDERING TEENAGERS: Whodathunk that this would be the positive message for teens in 2012? Sick, pathetic and mind-numbing. Ours is one pathological culture, its very own axis of evil.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Addresses mental illness, not necessarily in a positive light, but the characters are loved and accepted by friends, family and acquaintances.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I've been a fan of Star Trek since it was first on television, so I've had this collection first in VHS tape, then DVD, and now blu-ray. I also have the original series on blu-ray. Even so, I probably would not have purchased this boxed set except for the extremely low sale price. It was sort of an impulse purchase.<br /><br />As you would expect, the picture and sound quality is better than DVD. My system includes 5.1 surround sound, an HD projector and a big screen.<br /><br />There are a number of documentary-style extras as I expected. They are in sub-directories in the extensive extra feature section of each disk. I haven't had the time to look at all of them yet, but I have watched all the movies. I haven't seen the \\"captain's conference\\" disk yet.<br /><br />The extras also have a running Starfleet Database functio, a kind of running glossary of terms and mini-biographies of characters and events, which can be accessed while watching the movie, but it isn't complete. I remember trying to find the source of the quote \\"may fortune favor the foolish\\" in the index and it wasn't there. I ended up looking this up on the internet after watching the movie.<br /><br />All in all, I'm pleased with the purchase. It is a nice addition to my extensive collection of Star Trek videos. I would not have been so pleased with it if I had paid $50 to $75 for this set.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game that my boys love. They are 4 and 7 yrs old and they enjoy it very much!
B008602KQI|4.0|Okay, I have to admit I'm more of a reader than a movie goer, but I did want to see how well they did with this book. As usual, most of the details were left out, so you don't get to know the characters very well. However, they did do a good job of conveying the basic storyline and they did keep the movie moving along.<br /><br />One good thing was that they took a lot of the gore out of the movie and it didn't detract too much from the storyline. Seeing children killing children wouldn't make for good theater.<br /><br />Overall, it was worth seeing and was enjoyable, although, as you might guess, the book was better . . .
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|This is a movie based on real events. That is where the similarity ends. The writer and director decided to make torture the key to finding out where Bin Laden was hiding, but those who were involved in the investigation claim torture had nothing to do with finding him.<br /><br />If you remember that it's just a fictional story, it's an okay movie. As a \\"documentary\\", it fall far short of being truthful.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Much more realistic than the movie but still a happy ending, loved it!  Totally recommended to anyone looking for an easy entertaining read...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love playing bingo but had a lot of trouble with getting things that are sent to me and my husband
B009XEE0DW|5.0|Latest and best so far. She and her squad keep cranking out great work. I'm as respectful as I am enchanted.
1616550414|5.0|The book is amazing!! :D<br />From the pictures, to learning the Hero's timeline, and to the Skywards Sword prequel manga. Through there is a small mistake in page 89.<br />Like what I wrote for the title I love Hyrule Historia. :)
B008O9V4C2|3.0|Fagen takes some time to study and really listen. I love all his work and when I can, I will put in the time.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book as it reinforces the overwhelming evidence that Americans are not getting fatter because of fat. We are getting fatter because of the huge amounts of grain flour we consume in cereals, breads, muffins, crackers, granola bars, etc. The author's unique take is the changed nature of wheat itself-from the long stemmed einkorn wheat that mankind ate for thousands of years to the hybrid dwarf wheat that is hugely different (down to the amount of chromosomes in it).  Also interesting was the author's case that wheat is the cause of many other modern-day ailments (diabetes, GERD, etc.) A little technical at times and footnooted throughout, the book makes a good case that processed foods made with refined flour in the quantities Americans consume is not healthy and that better health and weight loss is obtained with its elimination from our everyday diet.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Great and historical movie, plus it's got Russell Crowe in it so that's your selling point right there is it not?

B0067EKY7M|3.0|Glossed over too many interactions of the characters especially of the wife. The changed ending was stupid. Nobody would build a dam that good be completely destroyed by just opening the spillways. What was wrong with a flash flood as in the book. If you were really bored and were looking to waste a couple of hours, this would do it.

1402270275|5.0|From the very first page of Kiss of Steel I was swept away by Bec McMaster's lovely writing style; her three dimensional characters, stunning dialogues and surreal universe are so brilliantly executed that I'm giving this book a 5+ star rating.<br /><br />This is a story about vampires but McMaster does such a brilliant job of claiming them as her own that they almost felt new again. There are three different subgroups to the vamps in her lore and I really enjoyed the way that we get glimpses into each of their lifestyles. They live in a tiered society so life's very different in the rookeries compared to the Echelon. The amount of detail that Bec put into this book is staggering; her vampires don't even feed like typical blood suckers! The minutia is evident in her world building as well; I loved stepping into McMaster's London Steampunk universe! I lost myself for hours in her descriptions of the gritty city streets and feminine petticoats.<br /><br />At first I wasn't a fan of Blade but he quickly grew on me once he started to open up to Honoria. I loved his constant inner struggle with his Blue Blood half; it added an element of vulnerability to his otherwise tough guy exterior. Blade's scary as hell not because he's a straight up badass but because he's barely holding on to the reigns of his sanity! His dialogues were some of the most entertaining parts of this book; McMaster does a phenomenal job of portraying his street accent. I think this would make a great audiobook with the right narrator!<br /><br />Honoria's side of the story is an emotional upwards battle from page one. Fallen from her privileged life, she finds herself barely making ends meet and desperate times call for desperate measures. Blade is her absolute last resort but as her situation becomes direr she's forced deeper into the master of the rookeries dept. Just when you think that Honoria can't possibly get knocked down again, she does. I really felt for her and by the end of this book I was so happy that she had Blade looking out for her. Miss Todd's growth as a character is remarkable; I especially enjoyed watching her realize that some of her founding principles were wrong. It's not easy to change the way you think but love is a powerful thing.<br /><br />The ending is HEA perfection; Blade saves Honoria and she saves him in return. It made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside! Kiss of Steel is steampunk at its best; I'll definitely be buying Heart of Iron when it hits shelves tomorrow!so happy that she had Blade looking out for her.

B001DM1VXE|2.0|The first minutes of the movie reminded me of the TV show \\"Touch\\" with Kiefer Sutherland. Since this movie was released in 1998, I would say it inspired those who made \\"Touch,\\" first aired on January 25, 2012 on Fox. The only difference is that in Pi, the genius is a grown up man. The rest is all the same: you'll find the Jewish guy who shares his knowledge and the meaning of numbers with the hero, the billion dollars firm. The motivations of those that try to \\"get\\" the genius are also somewhat similar.<br />Personally, I prefer the TV show \\"Touch\\" :)

On the technical side, this DVD plays perfectly, no skips or wierdness that we have found in other rushed to print DVDs. As for  the production itself -- it is stunning; the actors and whatever digital magic was done is perfection personified. Life of Pi  is truly a tale told so well you can watch it again and again. Worth every penny!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging puzzle game with great graphics.  Clues don't give away too much.  Could have had one or two more levels.  Please make the next one longer.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Love this movie.  If you're ADHD and into action flicks, you probably won't like it.  I like character driven shows, with a lot of internal conflict, so this was right up my alley.  Colin Firth does a fantastic job, as per usual, and he's very easy on the eyes.<br /><br />Very sad that the actual king was encouraged to smoke, and then died of lung cancer.  That wasn't covered in the movie, though.
0307887448|5.0|Reading Ready Player One was like experiencing almost all of the best things in life. I say almost because there's nothing about being a dad in there, but there's a lot to offer. Reading the book was like playing all of my favorite video games, hanging out with close friends, falling in love, going on risky adventures, facing odds that seem impossible, and so much more. Did I mention the book is jam packed with classic 80s pop culture, especially having to do with video games? Yeah, as many dudes my age and a bit older I'm sure have said - it seems like this book was written for me. This book has stuff about just about every geeky thing I love. In an interview I heard Ernest Cline say something like: \\"I think this is the geekiest book ever written.\\" This is the most fun I've ever had reading a book, and one of my favorite things to do in the entire world is read a book - so it was kind of amazing. I'm also a writer of fiction so I really appreciated the fantastic story told in this novel. I couldn't read this thing fast enough, and yet I wanted to savor every chapter and didn't want it to ever end. The characters were fleshed out so well they reached out of the page, or in may case out of my earphones, and into my head where they lived and breathed. I was rooting for them the whole time and was so excited for them when they went up against bad guys. There are so many cool adventures that are so awesome for so many reasons! Many of them are like quests in video games you have loved. If you're a gamer you will be putting down the controller and using your well practiced fast fingers to turn the pages instead of mashing buttons. This book was so many things, it's kind of hard to sum up all of them and say why the book was such a pleasure to read. The villain was excellent as well, a dude you just loved to hate. All of the characters were very believable and very much their own person that I felt I just happened to be reading about.<br /><br />I read this book by listening to the audiobook. It's how I do pretty much all of my reading because I have 2 hours of commuting a day, and I simply love audio books. Wil Wheaton is the narrator for this book, and he's the perfect man for the job. You can really tell that he's as excited as you and the characters are about all the cool stuff going on and cool retro gaming stuff you're geeking out about. You can tell it's a book that he absolutely loves, and his enthusiasm comes out so well and really makes the audio book a fantastic listen. If this audio book were a game, Wil Wheaton would get the high score as narrator.<br /><br />One last thing that I think is easy to glance over because Ernest does it so well. The world of this book is at times so amorphous that I could imagine clearly writing what was going on would be immensely difficult. Cline pulls it off seamlessly. You have your character, who's usually in an artificial world, and then many times playing an old school game inside of that world, so you're reading about a character playing or sometimes being inside a game within a game. It's a bit Inception, but so much more fun.<br /><br />And that's what I'd like to sum up this review with. This book is fun, ridiculously fun. It's also an amazing story. I wonder just how many times I'm going to be rereading this one. Probably as many times as Wade has read Anorak's Almanac.ing to the audiobook.

B00364K6YW|5.0|Excellent version of P&P!  Very well cast.  BUT, the director completely dropped the ball on one of the most important scenes in the entire series.  At the end, when they were walking along after having realized that they were in love, the problem was--they were walking along!  There was no eye contact.  The emotional impact of the scene was lost as they looked at the ground, at a moment when they should have been looking into each other's eyes with all the chemistry and passion that this couple possessed.  Seriously, it nearly ruined the whole thing.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|For those people who are into Tolkein breaking up The Hobbit into 3 parts is not excessive. Jackson is superb and I am so pleased he has created more in the Tolkein line-up. Fantasy is a difficult genre to interpret with realism. Jackson does it so well. The cast is fabulous and there are softer and touching parts throughout the action.
0131103628|1.0|As a teaching tool, this book is close to useless: you learn programming by doing programming. The examples are few and on top of it, abstract. In terms of programming practice, this book is a big reason why generations of C programmers write insecure code - does \\"buffer overflow attack\\" ring a bell? The explanation on pointers is pathetically inadequate - I did not understand everything there is to understand about pointers until I used a debugger and could see for myself what a debugger does. This is the 21st century: take any one of the courses on youtube and use a debugger. If you really have to use a book, use Deitel and Deitel.

B008220C56|2.0|Having first heard of the newest Anna Karenina film via a trailer on the Les Miserables Blu Ray (A far superior film), and recognizing it as an adaptation of Tolstoy, my room mate and I split the bill and picked it up at the next available opportunity.  We are big fans of what mainstream media has dubbed \\"more artistic\\" styles of film, especially musicals... which we mistakenly believed Anna Karenina was.  We love films that push certain boundaries of acceptable filmmaking in order to tell a story.  If it enhances the story and overall experience, we're all for it and we sincerely hoped Anna Karenina would do just that!<br /><br />When we both had a mutual night off we broke out the popcorn, large cups of Cherry Pepsi (the perfect movie beverage as far as I'm concerned), popped in front of the home theater system (Klipsche Icon *smiley face*), and braced ourselves for what we thought would be a magical experience.<br /><br />It was not.<br /><br />Prior to picking up Anna Karenina, I read some of the user reviews on them internets to see what us everyday folk thought about it and, despite overwhelming evidence that I was about to purchase something incredibly stupid... I went ahead anyway and bought it.  What my room mate, who we shall lovingly refer to as \\"Tito,\\" and I were immediately subjected to was a rushed style of story telling that can be over simplified in one word; \\"huh?\\"  Anna Karenina portrays itself as if... as if it were on an actual stage at a vintage-style theater and the only way the audience can watch this play is through the lens of a camera crew that film EVERYTHING including backstage and the above rafters.  When one character goes 'upstairs' to witness something he literally goes into the stage rafters!  You also see a faux curtain go up and down and stage hands removing pieces of scenery.  The only parts that were not filmed entirely on location at the Jim Beam Primary School of Theater were the country shots at the Levin Estate.  Even the 'snow' on the locomotives were more fake than Joan Rivers' face.<br /><br />On top of the really bizarre method of filming and portrayal the plot moves waaay too fast, the characters are hurriedly introduced, and not really elaborated on until later.  For instance, the film begins with adulterous brother to Anna Karenina, Stiva, getting caught up in his philandering ways, causes drama, gets the attention and sympathy of his sister Anna, and off she goes to see him.  Now, maybe my ADD makes it more difficult for me to process fast pacing story and dialog spoken by people with mismatched accents (British accents on Russian roles including Jude Law, it's Enemy at the Gates all over!), but come on people!  Talk a little slower and elaborate on the relations between characters because, to me, it seems as though the roll call for the entire Russian elite and royal family resembles the same style of roster for the city council of Rock Ridge (Johnson, Johnson, Johnson, Johnson, Johnson, etc.).<br /><br />Granted, like War and Peace, Tolstoy made Anna Karenina a textbook size novel with over 800 pages and that means you have to condense the story... a LOT.  However, let us briefly compare this adaptation to the one that inspired me to buy it; Les Miserables.<br /><br />Anna Karenina was between 850-900 pages depending on what version you read, Les Miserables is almost 1,500!  Despite this, I was able to follow along with Les Miserables even with the poor group singing in certain parts.  Within ten minutes of watching Les Miserables I got the notion of who Jean Valjean is, a victim, and that prison guard and later Police Inspector Javert is an obsessive man with some serious issues.<br /><br />If Les Miserables can be effectively condensed, so can Anna Karenina.<br /><br />Alas, I digress.<br /><br />Tito and I attempted to keep up with the film and, for awhile, we were able to piece together some of the crazy love story without the need of a schematic.  However, what made the film more difficult to follow were the characters themselves.  I have NOT read the original novel (I have, however, read War and Peace) and cannot speak to how well the acting portrays the characters, but we felt as though all of them were... *thinks of an accurate, yet appropriate word to use* ... er... we hated them all.  They were all self-absorbed jerks that were too full of themselves to think of the consequences of their actions.  It was like watching an episode of any reality TV show whose title begins with \\"Real Housewives of\\" as the absurdity of the outlandish pageantry seemed totally pointless and the problems the characters experienced were brought upon themselves.<br /><br />I could not relate to any of the characters save for one, Levin, who was not a *insert bad name here* but an honest land owner with good professional scruples.  The only good aspect of the Levin side story is that that one actually ended well but, watch the film for yourself if you wanna know how... at your own risk.<br /><br />When the love triangles came full circle between Anna Karenina and Count Vronsky, a cavalry officer that Tito and I personally wanted to take out back and beat with various garden implements, came full circle we stopped taking the film seriously and began to riff it.  This means that we began throwing out ad lib commentary and numerous non sequiturs to make the film more interesting.  When a prominent character committed suicide towards the end of the film, we cheered as the drama of THAT person had come to end... THANK GOD.<br /><br />All in all, Anna Karenina was highly anticipated by myself and Tito but the film tried waaaay too hard to be artistic and, in essence, inadvertently engaged in a horrible act of self-sabotage.  It ruined itself with what was a stellar cast and a seemingly beautiful story.  I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless you are an amateur riffer that needs something to make fun of.ilm more difficult to follow were the characters themselves.

0670026557|3.0|We have been actively involved in business networking for years.  When we heard that &#34;Give and Take&#34; was being published, we pre-ordered.  The premise of the book is that there are three types of people that you will meet in your business life; Takers, Match makers, and the focus of the book - Givers.  One of the most i9nteresting chapters talks about the differences between those Givers that rise to lead their companies - and those that stay on the bottom rung.  For those of us that have a natural Giving bent - this is the one chapter you should read.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the best part of the book is to read the one chapter, then skip to the end of the book.  There is a GREAT section on how to apply the principles that the author took soooo long to make.<br /><br />David Spatz

Chris Tucker did an excellent job as well. This is what great film making is all about!!<br /><br />Christopher Berry
B005EGXTL2|4.0|A little different from the earlier books, simply because things have moved on now that a revolution has begun! But whilst there are no Hunger Games in the strictest sense, Mockingjay continues the Hunger Games themes of enemies and allies . . . and kill or be killed.<br /><br />Not quite as good as The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, but an enthralling read, nonetheless. With so many human losses, though, the story was heartbreaking at times.

0061478784|4.0|HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE by Diana Wynne Jones was wonderful. I have a penchant for flawed protagonists and this book did not let me down. I had a few complaints, but over all the story was engaging, descriptive, and original. Just a warning for those of you coming here from the Miyazaki film: With the exception of a few nice visual aids, the movie does you no good here.<br /><br />I really only had two complaints, which is saying something for me. 1) I felt that the language -- the flow of words, if you will -- could have used a bit more polishing. I understand that it's a children's book, but there were passages (and even pages) that just felt a little rough around the edges. 2) For being the villain of the piece, the Witch of the Waste is barely in the book until very near the end. Even her secondary presence through the different curses didn't /feel/ as ominous as it should have. To boot, while everyone else was gloriously complex, the Witch herself seemed rather one-dimensional.<br /><br />Okay, seriously, those are my only two complaints. This is a fabulous book and is quite a bit different from other children's fantasies out there. Even as an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Four-and-a-half stars.
B00CATSONE|3.0|A fairly well written overview that covers Tesla's life. It doesn't delve too deeply into any one area. I downloaded it hoping it would have more details on they Wycliffe tower but it only gave the usual overview. It's more geared toward the subject of creativity in a self-help way.
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|Another movie that asks why can't a hero just be a hero without all the baggage, and believe me there is plenty.  So much time was spent developing the emotional baggage of the main character that I never finished watching it.

Social media is changing the very fabric about how businesses reach consumers as well as consumer relations, in the book Erik Qualman points out how businesses are using social media right it and why they're successful. its not if a business is using social media but how well they use it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book was very enthrawling and I got it right after I had ordered it. I recommend this book to young adult readers because of most of the adult situations.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was really hooked in the beginning of the book and throughout the middle, but the end dragged somewhat and was a little disappointing.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|The people that do not like the reality of this movie have no idea what it is like to have a debilitating illness
B001DM1VXE|1.0|The title of this movie was misleading, giving the reader the impression this movie was about a serious event in numbers. This movie was made for idiots and not for the average person. If you dont value your time, then you could spend it watching a movie for idiots. I gave this movie a single star because I could not give it a zero. Good luck.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|when I got the app,I went to my inventory and got a crap load of diamonds cuz I couldn't find any, but thanks to the people who made it now I am &quot; rich&quot;.(you guy's should add skins to this it wold make it better)<br /><br />  ;)
B0086700CM|5.0|Get this now don't hesitate to even read the reviews just get it now cause you have never ever played a game this COOL. definitely a standard issue app GET NOW!!!!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|He loved this movie but didn't realize it was only the first part. Now he's eager to see the next one.
B00BZOD63S|5.0|This movie was well written and the actresses did a great job.  I loved the scenery and the visuals on this.  It is a great scary movie to add to any collection.  The story is never boring so you don't have to worry about that and the scary factor was just the right amount without gore.  Would highly recommend to anyone that likes a good scary show.
B00004UZL3|5.0|One the those CD you can listen to front to back straight through, then want to listen to it over again. A classic that has AMAZINGLY CLEAR soundquality at least on my polydor  813651-2 West German version. Just aurally pleasing! The only other record I own that just SOUNDS that good its Jimi Hendrix's complilation Kiss the Sky (Reprise 84). Just amazed at how good this album sounds, doesn't hurt that is an excellent album either. Up there with Tommy, and The Who Sell Out as my fav Who records.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved it!! Can't wait to catch up on Season 3! This drama is so compelling and has had me hooked since episode one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this series!  It was an easy read, and when neared the end, I read slower so I didn't have to finish the book.  I have read the entire series twice, and loved them both times!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Do yourself a favor and give this CD a try, Joe Bonamassa is amazing! Give your soul a gift, a gift of real talent.
B001BANK32|5.0|This was one of few times that the movie was as good as the book.  I still loved the book, it was kind of scary and had great character development, and a great story!
B00005YW4H|5.0|How can a woman so beautiful also be so talented? The next time your trying to romance your lady pop this CD in and don't stop poring the wine!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Mile 81 is a typical bizarre King story.  It was a fast read, and kind of a spin off of &#34;From a Buick 8&#34;, but I found it an enjoyable read.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Another great CD from the Zac Brown Band, make sure you listen to it before your little ones do there's a few songs with special words.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I saw the trailer of WWZ with Brad Pitt and I've always liked the books better than the movies, so why not try it?  The book was good, just not what I expected.  POSSIBLE SPOILER..... The book is a bunch of different accounts of events that happened when the zombie apocalypse first started.  It does not follow one character and tell his/her story.  It was good, but not a real &#34;page turner&#34;.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|This movie is beautiful. The cast is great and they did all their own singing. If you love The Beatles you will love this movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this series!  It was an easy read, and when neared the end, I read slower so I didn't have to finish the book.  I have read the entire series twice, and loved them both times!  Why do they put a requirement on the length of these reviews???? It doesn't make any sense. I could sum up a good book in a couple words, and a bad book in less than that!!!!
B001I0T92Q|1.0|This guy sales fake items! DO NOT BUY! REPEAT DO NOT BUY! You'll just be wasting your money! This guy is nothing but a thief!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this series!  It was an easy read, and when neared the end, I read slower so I didn't have to finish the book.  I have read the entire series twice, and loved them both times!  Why do they put a requirement on the length of these reviews???? It doesn't make any sense. I could sum up a good book in a couple words, and a bad book in less than that!!!!
0810994739|5.0|My daughter loves all these books.  They are so funny and just a good read, plus it's broke up with pictures which are also funny.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|This was a HUGE disappointment.  If you are into long pointless love stories than you will like this book.  At first, I loved this book, but after the main character meets his &#34;love interest&#34; the book just went downhill.  Not even the ending made up for this books content.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|As a SciFi buff, I enjoy a good different story and this one was great.  I'm hoping they'll be more. You won't be disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|It was a boring game.  After playing it about four or five times it became boring and I uninstalled it.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|By the third novel, it was boring.  I finished the second one and hoped the third would really take it to the next level and be something special.  No, it wasn't .  It was boring, pendantic and seriously all three books could have been one really much finer book than a trilogy.  I am glad E L James had commercial success, I really regret that some of that was because of my dollars.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Seller is professional and speedy. The product itself is fantastic. Light weight responsive and just plain cool looking. It complements my nautical space age laptop theme. I am debating whether to buy another for my cpu.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had to read it. It was good as far as it went and when I discovered there was more, this book made me want to read more. I read it....the characters were likeable and of course the male was wealthy and could do whatever he liked and exactly how he liked it...I mean seriously, had the Mr. Grey been a small town plumber or the local church deacon...nope, would have had a different point of view...and would have gone nowhere fast.  As for the lady love...maybe girls today are far more adventurous than the girls I grew up with...she caught on to things awfully quickly for so many \\"first times\\" and swallowed her own value system far too easily, if you'll pardon the unintended entendre.
0525478817|5.0|The characters in the book are wonderfully written. The story has some plot points that are questionable when it comes to real-life possibilities. However, I very much enjoyed this book. I laughed and cried. You won't be sorry if you read this book.<br />DFTBA.
0440297001|5.0|This is a book everyone should read.  It's based on a true period in history and to know how some people were required to live even when war didn't occur on their soil, but the occupiers did and how it impacted their lives was astounding.  This is a story of friendship, privation, sharing and caring.  After I read it, I gave several copies as gifts. Excellent read.
B003ZA0BCY|5.0|Won't spoil the ending for you, but my wife and I have enjoyed this movie for years and finally bought a copy.<br /><br />Alicia Silverstone is a bit stiff in the beginning scenes, but warms up as the movie progresses.<br /><br />Brendan Fraser has the right balance of innocence and 50s era values and manhood to play the part.<br /><br />Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek are hilarious as his parents.  Spacek subtly plays the bored...and slightly tipsy housewife who longs to see the light of day....<br /><br />Moves a little slow in a few places...but great story line.  Arrived as promised.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It was well, forced and not as interesting and being one that feels an obligation to finish a book once I start it...I finished it.  I did go on to read the next one in the hopes it would get better.
B00A83075M|5.0|Wreck It Ralph was a great family movie that kept everyone's attention. Excellent story line and graphics were great! Definitel a must have DVD!
B005HSL626|3.0|It is an amazingly fun game to play. You can change modes, backgrounds,and knives but.... it blacks out on me and it freezes up when I'm in the middle of playing.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Dualshock controllers are perfect! You really feel more drawn to the game and this one was in great shape! Super fast shipping as well! Thanks!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this game.my friend recommended this to me and I lobe it.and for teens and kids there is a kid safe setting which I like.I highly 'recommend this game.
0316067598|5.0|This is a great book .After reading first hand account books written by two different seal snipers you begin to understand  how much awarenes these men have in intense situations .Also how these men even when they know they are mortally wounded will fight till they fall to save the lives of their military brothers.  They die for us................
B0012HRJEA|4.0|I thought it was an appropriate take on the original text. The humor was great kept going by the modern dialogue on top of modern video. The sanctity and history of the original text was kept and so for that reason I think that the story is an appropriate take. I however do not feel as if Shakespeare would approve. The movie is a great movie but it's not something Shakespeare would approve of. I feel as if he would want a modern movie to take on the modern text. The play should be fit to the period, in this case it is a modern time and so it would only make sense for the dialogue to follow. I truly enjoyed the movie I just do not think it is something that Shakespeare would endorse. The movie could have been greatly improved if the dialogue was brought in to match the setting however it would lose the humor. The movie is however great for what it is, a comedic take on a age old story.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is truly a story of survival. I don't think many girls her age would have survived. I hope her story gives any woman strength. That parole officer should be shot! Talk about not paying attention to the obvious. If Miss Dugard didn't bring a suit against that parole officer, she should sue the state.
0307269981|4.0|This was a good bridge to both the first and last book. Despite its size, it was a quick read, with good background and cliff-hanging set-ups. Too bad there were only three that were finally published.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is great, a variety of games to play,love it, I play it all the time,can't wait to unlocked the other games
030726999X|4.0|While the violence is still uber present, the female character's cunning, clever smarts, and insightful assessments of people who'd most likely harm and help her make her violent and cat-like actions the basis for much applause. She jumps off the page. All three of these books give a peek into the reason most civilized countries have strict gun control laws and need to have just as strict laws against injuring others, especially women.
B009VB97EY|2.0|The movie had no real plot to it, could not hold my interest, and was a movie I felt did not deserve to be shown at major movie theaters.  It was recommended to me by a friend who did enjoy it.
B00A6TYCNQ|4.0|This game is amazing - console quality graphics/detail.(or better!) You don't need to spend $ you just go back & level up!!!  Gameloft just keeps getting better!<br />PS - I was sooo glad you could zoom the camera down because I don't like overhead view games. Sweet!
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This was a great story. Anyone can relate to this movie about growing up, and feeling as though you were treated unfairly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is SUPER cool! I've played it a lot and my bro Loves it! A very fun game and lots of endless powers, people, and boards<br />!!! :)
B007ZXK08C|5.0|So enjoyable with such a twist. Could not put the book down.<br />A book for everyone. I will certainly read more from this author
0525478817|3.0|My friends insisted that I read &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34;. &#34;It's a teen book but still deep.&#34; These rumors are true. However my friends also gave me a 100% guarantee that this book would change my life. While this may be true for some, it wasn't for me and here's why.<br /><br />The fault In Our Stars deals with the issues of mortality in the eyes of a cancer ridden teenage girl. John Green does a great job of accurately portraying teen angst, and even what a girl generally thinks. The book shows loving parents, disease, life, love, death and how the characters deal with it all. It was well done.<br />However the other half of the book consisted of romance. The two main characters were bonded through simply spending time together, and their love of a book. Overall I felt their relationship needed more development. If they had not had cancer and fear of death, their relationship might not have been as strong. Some may say that is the point. But because of that I personally was not interested in the characters falling in love or not. Since their romance is a good chunk of the book, I had trouble being fully interested.
B007G92QGO|5.0|A must read. I could not put the book down, lost out on a lot of sleep<br />Is he guilty????
158270208X|1.0|this book looked leather-like but was not. the words are nice but I thought it would be bigger and softer as well as easier to keep open rather than having to hold it open or put it face down (damaging the spine). not my favourite at all.
0374214913|3.0|While it was a decent read, I thought it got bogged down in the technical/computer stuff. I didn't really connect with a single character, Clay and Mr. Penumbra could have been fleshed out a lot more and I saw that kind of ending coming a mile away. It felt like all the secondary players were just there to drive the plot and play their small part. I sure would have liked to learn so much more about Mr. Penumbra!
1451673442|4.0|this compact book is easy to carry around with all the inspirational words I need to make it through the day and have a positive outlook.<br />'good' is how I rate it. not finished it yet but will edit this when done (if needed).
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The music of this concert is simply beautiful.  I however did not think all of the voices were the best sounding except for the two main male characters whose voices were stupendous and their firey duet contrasting each other sent chills through me, perfectly outstanding.  Over all the entire cast did a fabulous job in their characterizations, I really felt moved and the spark of freedom wonderfully conveyed.  Bravo!
1878424319|5.0|5 Stars*<br />I would and have reccommended this book to many. Considering starting a book club and this book will definately be on the agenda.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter loves this app.<br />I also like  playing it with her. It works so much better when you are connected to WiFi not so great without it.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|The heading here says it all. The whole  book is so predictable replete with  clichés,  lots of  filler and  less than half  dedicated to  actual sniping. I suppose we could call it &#34;a personal journey&#34; but I wasn't looking for that.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Just catching up on a well-liked series. The ability to watch past seasons on my Kindle Fire through Prime is a real treat.  I've loved every show.  Each provides a crisp legal issue and the glimpses into the personal lives of the characters. Amazing writing and great acting.
0143038583|4.0|This was a great choice in learning about the issues with our methods of feeding our country.  I plan to read it.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|We had high hopes for him, but it wasn't the best. It showed a broken self destructing man, but it was a downer. Plus Amazon movies continue to stop about 2/3rds of the way though on our Roku box, only Amazon movies have this problem. Very frustrating...we'll just buy them on another channel. Amazon needs to fix this issue!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wow. Written from the perspective of the Grim Reaper, this story chronicles the life of a foster child in Hitler's Germany. Strikes at so many of the questions about what would it be like, being an ordinary family, when all your neighbors and friends have been washed away with propaganda. Excellent read.
B003GK2216|4.0|I liked it because it is historic, and tells uses of the Middle Ages.  I think it is not a beoautiful use of the lenguage, there are repetitive explanations and things of the sort.<br />I recommed it to people interested in Middle Age, Churches and Cathedrals.
0307740919|3.0|A story of a war torn man and his journey back home. Think of the twists and turns, around the subject of race, in the tone of Toni Morrison and you've got a sense of the book. It was short, but sweet. I would likely read it again, just because there were some elements that I think were so subtle they might have been missed upon first read.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|I like historic novels, I did not find a well writen book (too many repetitions of explanations of who is who; and even the grammar, although English is not my mother tongue, I found sometimes a little &#34;faulty&#34;.<br />I recommed it to people who likes history (and don't know a lot of it!)
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Great nerd fiction. I highly recommend this book to people who are google fanatics. I found myself quickly lost in the tale and enjoyed the twists and turns.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I like historic novels, I did not find a well writen book (too many repetitions of explanations of who is who; and even the grammar, although English is not my mother tongue, I found sometimes a little &#34;faulty&#34;.<br />I recommed it to people who likes history (and don't know a lot of it!)
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Flynn is the same author as Gone Girl that I went ga-ga over earlier this year. Although this is rate 5, I wouldn't rant as strongly about this book. It's about a female journalist, who happens to be a cutter, who is sent from her beat in Chicago back to the south to cover a potential serial murderer in her hometown. Struggling with a family history of drinking and emotional abuse, the protagonist struggles to both connect to her family as well as members of the community in order to find the killer before he or she kills again.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I love this game, and immediately bought the extra levels. I played up to 6, then opened it one day and all my extra levels were gone, as well as all my progress. I removed it from my Kindle, downloaded it again from my cloud, and it showed that I had purchased the extension, but put my progress back to the first level. Good thing I enjoy the game, I just replayed them all with wackier items to see how bizarre I could get and still win. Sometimes the touch response isn't 100% accurate, many times I would grab an item and it just wouldn't come to me, or wouldn't go where I dropped it. Overall my favorite game by far, I wish they would add more levels, make a second one, something. But it doesn't get repetitive or boring, and .99 is a bargain compared to some of the games they sell for Kindle.
030758836X|5.0|So good! It's a story about a woman, who disappears from her home on the day of her 5th anniversary under mysterious circumstances. Rewinding and going forward in time, the authors reveals twists and turns of the story of the young couple who had met in NYC, had been successful professionals, been laid off, and forced to move to the small town of the husband in the south. I didn't think I would like the book, and frankly it started a bit slow, but around page 80 (kindle page) I got sucked in and just couldn't put down the book. I would recommend it to others.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Addicting fast paced action.  Love it. Can't get enough of this game. Can easily lose track of time. Try it, I promise you'll love it.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|I got this to go along with the optional charger. It was flimsy and didn't connect well. I bought the black one and am much happier.
B000YD7S26|4.0|Actually I have seen from Mezzo TV and heard these symphonies many, many times, in live and in records.<br />Very special for that recording is the fact, that 8th symphony is recorded in A. Bruckner's church, near to Linz.<br />The interpretation is great, perhaps the best Herbert von Karajan's. But the very best has not achieved, if to compare<br />with W. Furtw&auml;ngler's old, after war recordings. Nowadays recordings perhaps Claudio Abbado with Berliner<br />Philharmoniker have reached that level of interpretation of Anton Bruckner's music.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I loved Andy Whitfield and was saddened by his tragic, early passing.  But, Liam McIntyre and crew continue this adventure with all the blood, sweat and passion that Andy was able to.  It still has the edge that made the original so popular.  Definitely a great continuing story and well worth it if you enjoyed the series from the beginning.
B005LAIIJY|2.0|Tedious. Hours of boredom punctuated by moments of light entertainment. How did Q. Tarantino get to be such a big deal? His sense of timing alone puts me off. His humor is juvenile and what he finds meaningful is absurd.<br /><br />In one sequence, Django is separated from his long-lost wife for months or years and then decides to do a winter's worth of bounty hunting before going to rescue her. Meanwhile, she is probably being beaten and raped. He doesn't seem to care. Finally, he finds her. Then, unbelievably, he waits behind a door while the good doctor Schultz rambles on and on, pointlessly. The first delay is sort of forgivable, as we are only told about it. The second delay is maddening.<br /><br />The ending does not honor the characters or pay off what has been set up. (SPOILER ALERT) For example, the formerly clever Dr. Schultz gets stupid and shoots Calvin Candie (stupid name, both for him and for Candyland) and then is shot by a minor character. Schultz has been the pivotal character, the lynchpin for the whole plot. Then boom, he is gone. No grand finale here. And his action violates the character. An opportunity for drama wasted.<br /><br />Overall, this was a good idea for a movie--white bounty hunter rescues black man from slavery--but this movie is slow, stupid, and juvenile, a long slow form of torture.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I chose this five star rating because the reader is carried along in order to learn how Pi manages to outwit the tiger, using his knowledge of wild animals. Being raised the son of a zoo keeper, he learned practical information as well as a hard work ethic.  He never seriously thought of giving up. Much of the story is gruesome, but easily accepted as realistic, not just for the purpose of startling the reader.
1400069807|5.0|Incredibly well researched & thought out insight to our daily sustenance.  While we probably suspected much of what Michael Moss has documented (at least the general driving forces behind the Food Giants), to see it with inside facts & quotes from the participants just hammers home the intensity with which this battle is being waged...<br /><br />READ IT- It could change your life!
B000MCIBE8|5.0|This album contains music that was a &#34;game changer&#34; when it was released in the 1960s and holds up extremely well into the 21st century. Highly recommended.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|I'll come right out and say that the first half hour of the movie didn't do anything for me.  I thought it was much weaker than the first one, but after the first half hour it really went up a notch or two and continued to improve.  Don't expect it to be fantastic, if I'd seen it in the theater I'd probably have felt cheated, but as a rental its a nice two hours.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|What can I  say, I love this show! Not run of the mill TV show. Love all the characters, especially Tig:)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Remember MacGyver? (80's TV show), ya he get left behind in Mars....<br /><br />That's what I though this book is about when I first started reading it. But luckily, the NASA got involved too. What makes this book different from other Scifi books I have read is that the lead character and some of other main characters dialogs are sometimes...well most of the time are hilarious. You get lots of LOL moments when reading this book. I think that's what save this book from being a manual of 'how to survive in Mars if you get left behind'. I thought the ending could have been bit better (...\\"that's what she said\\"....) but nevertheless, I give it 5 stars!<br /><br />BTW, I was lucky enough to grab this for $.099, just before Andy Weir sold the publishing rights. Hope they will make a movie out of this.
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|Nothing more to say, opera as it is rarely seen these days!<br />That opera houses return to these types of performances... what a concept - a classic performed - classically!
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|A perfect adaptation of the novel. If you love the book you will love this film. I imagine Austen giving it her seal of approval.
1574241451|5.0|Great Book. In-depth. Very nice description of the make. Use it as a reference. Helps sort out the Gibson mystery.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|It is a wonderful  cd. I play it all the time while I am cleaning. How does that group keep on top! They are so awesome!!!!
B00AA2W4L6|4.0|Seen it 5 times, the best of the Iron Man Movies. Good soild modernized version of the Iron Man Origin story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should really buy this game. its worth the 7 bucks.  I suggest playing creative first. get used to the controls and then try survival
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|lots of the popular songs<br />great to just listen to<br />not too many to get bored of but all the popular songs<br />good recording quality too

1475143389|3.0|Very good down to earth approach.<br /><br />It's just a pity Mike pretends gay men don't exist. For gay men, Mike's references to taking your wife or girlfriend out to celebrate and to wanting to have a good body to impress women are just offensive in their failure to acknowledge the existence of gays and their legal entitlement to equality.<br /><br />Also, Mike, haven't you noticed that there are one or two gay men at the gym?
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed this read! The back and forth from today to WW2 was interesting and created a deeper understanding of the characters. I pride myself on being a good mystery solver, but was caught off guard by this one!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Keeps getting better! Author very talented! Open your mind to what other couples are doing! It's definitely interesting! Can't wait to read the next book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had me turning pages as fast as I could read.  Just when I thought I had things figured out, it would take another turn.  I did not expect any of it.  The relationships seemed true and honest.  Make sure you have time when you pick it up, because it will be awhile before you put it down.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Like AMAZON itself, this app does exactly what it is designed to with little fuss or bother. Works on any phone I have tried it.
B0095P29EG|5.0|Padme looks great in this movie, and her character is lovable to no ends. This is by far the best movie in the beloved 'Star Wars' saga.<br /><br />Although the absence of Kirk and Crichton does make it a little hard to enjoy at first, Padme's appearance really does improve the experience as a whole.<br /><br />I rate this 3 Zebras of 5 Dinner Rolls.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the hunger games series I started it in school and I just couldn't stop. BEST BOOK EVER &lt;3
B007MAETA8|5.0|The songs on this CD are awesome to listen too when you just want to chill and enjoy some well-crafted music.  Enjoyed it from beginning to end.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Awesome to have all 6 movies on blu-ray! Only gripe is the sound quality. The sound is literally all over the scale. No matter what I tried on my new RCA TV the sound was terrible.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|I enjoyed this CD overall, but there were a couple of songs that left me a little flat, but the high points outway the low points.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|A wonderful, fast moving book of intrigue and mystery!  Full of many very interesting characters, whose lives, the book follows.  Simply a terrific read and one you won't be able to put down!

B000HT3PPG|4.0|This is a favorite for the entire family!!  The faith of a child overcomes the doubts of the adults in her life.
B009AMANBA|5.0|it taught me more then i knew.about President Lincoln the person. i think everybody should watch this movie.  i am glad i got see it at home and will watch again and again. I am sure i missed something. not the best movie but very entertaining.
1595825045|5.0|This book is huge and chock full of all kinds of behind the scenes drawings of original character designs and storyboards and scenery. Beautiful and fascinating.
B008220D5K|5.0|the movies is very good. the actress and direct are married in real life and they use their daughters that makes it look alot more believable there is a good bond with the girls and mother.  Paul Rudd is a good actor is all he does.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|very interesting and unique type of show. I haven't seen anything like it in a while. based on a book I think.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Oh my gosh, this book is fantastic! It's such a beautiful book because of how it's written. I love how all the characters relate and tell the story.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The chief problem with most diets isn't the diet. It's &#34;What do I do AFTERWARD, once I've reached my weight loss goal?&#34; Maintenance is always the biggest challenge and the thing that defeats many of even the most successful dieters. This diet has an answer that is every bit as simple as the diet itself! The whole package is incredibly easy for even a crusty old bachelor like me to implement. Do yourself a BIG favor and look into it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Probably THE ONLY 5* review I have given to any Amazon app. Every aspect of the app has worked so far. I even downloaded the stopwatch part and the timer part (BTW... why 3parts?)
1609611543|5.0|This book will change the way you think about food! This literally made me rethink the foods I've eaten all my life. So glad I read it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one of my favorite games.  I love this game.  It is like your life, virtually. You can build anything you want.  Monsters and zombies, good combination.  Get it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|After reading description of 'Revenge' season 1 I was somewhat hesitant to watch because it sounded too soap-opera-ish. I decided to give it a go since it was free with my Prime membership. This is an intriguing, suspenseful show. I was pulled in and could not stop watching. Season 1's final show ended with a 'gotta watch more' finale so I purchased all of Season 2. Once you begin, you'll be drawn in. Madeline Stowe, who looks terrific, plays the role of an evil matriarch; brilliantly.
B000002P5R|5.0|I purchased the 1997 remastered version, as I'd read that this was one of the best remasters out there. I love the songs on this CD, they aren't the so often played radio-hits, but they are a classic Jimi sound. The sound quality on this CD is great as well; well balanced vocals and guitar.
B005MRXS78|5.0|Great price and so handy for those on your own shots. Set it up on a tripod and you 'll never miss a shot again.
B001EC3JME|1.0|my mag-tac flashlight falls out of the bottom of the holster, not compatible at all. this holster should not be advertized to work with this style flashlight.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Game is fun but difficult to get upgrades. Cant seem to be able to adjust altitude<br />or speed either. Still learning the game will tell more later.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|I was aware of some information from history programs about the efforts of the people involved in clandestine work during the war. I hadn't realized the extent of these efforts. Its incredible that there is still so little recognition of the people that made these efforts. God Bless Them All.
B009R659L8|4.0|I always enjoy Ms. Clark's book.  This wasn't the best one I have read that is why I gave it four stars.  But, it was good and kept me guessing until the end.
1401937268|5.0|I got a kick out of reading the reviews on how the cards were too large to shuffle. I have very small hands, in fact I can fit into some children gloves. Yet I have no problems shuffling the cards. Maybe it is because I have used for many years the Tarot of the Moon Goddess, which are round cards. I do like the Angel cards energy, they have a high vibration.I sometime read the words written on the card but focus more on the energy vibration, picture, and my intuition. These cards are good for new and experienced readers. As much as I love my 6 oracle decks I have by Doreen Virtue, I enjoy this tarot deck so much more! :)
0689878451|5.0|my son wants to read it every night  we really like this this purchase  just  awesome THAN YOU  THANK you
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I was half way through this book when I learned that Chris Kyle had been murdered right here in the United States. The book was as close to being in actual combat that you can get without smelling it. Chris didn't pull any punches in writing this book and I appreciated his candor and honest revelation of his experiences.  He definitely had the gift.
B00130VLZ4|5.0|As expected of Canon, the hard case is well made, it excepts my T4i with standard lens perfect. Great case.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Two excellent games, works of art if you ask me. ICO and Shadow of the Colossus are two masterpieces of the PS2 era, and now watching them in HD is a sight to behold. If you never experience these games this is your chance,they are beautiful and more look better than ever. If you played them in their time, you know that this HD Collection is worth the price of admission. Sometimes you want to do the same trek more than once
B005LAIH5O|5.0|I viewed the first movie ..... Clash of the Titans ... and really enjoyed it and enjoyed the characters and the plot. Also the actors, Sam, Liam, etc. did a great job . So I had to buy the sequel and found it equally as entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is such a fantastic game! This game is a great time killer and you will become addicted. Be sure to have a charger by your side!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|My wife and I are big fans of the LOTR series so we had to view this one.  We found it as entertaining and exciting as the original.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is very helpful and accurate to find out what the weather will be I recommend this to everyone
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This book seems as if it was written by a ghost writer, too much irrelevant prose. Hopefully the next book is better
B004EWFV9K|5.0|It was a good and fitting end to an aging detective novel.  I feel the same most of the time too!
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Written in a diary form, it needs an effort to understand the author's message in this book. It is not an easy read.
B002RKSV2U|4.0|I am a scientist, and have read much about biology and evolution. But I bought a paper version ten years ago, and as I expected, learned little about it that is not covered better in what seems to be hundreds of simple and detailed books, like those by Richard Dawkins. Evolution has been expanded and refined many times since Darwin’s gerrymandering theory.<br /><br />Unfortunately, like many technical books written earlier than 50 years ago, the style would be considered by many young people (and by me at 71) as stuffy and old-fashioned.<br /><br />It is easy to read and understand, but not what I would go to for modern evolutionary theory (which radical creationists still insist on calling “Darwinism.”)<br /><br />But I then bought the KIndle version, which I have found invaluable for my writing about his work, because of the great text searching and quote copying (complete with reference for footnotes).
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Glitches in the interface, at several points in the game I was unable to undo what should have been a reversable choice, no option to go back. Early in the game when I was unable to back out of a screen, I exited the game by selecting the Kindle home button. The game would not restart until I went into Running Apps in the system Settings, cleared cache and data and did a forced kill.  The game reinitialized but didn't mind much since I hadn't gone far in the game. At another point, the game presented a screen that appeared to offer a choice of different suits of armor.  I select one to get more info and then tried to back out because of the cost for the suit.  I was unable to back out and forced to pay 2000 Stark credits for the new suit.  The game then stated it was building the suit and the time to completion was 15 min!  You would literally have to sit and wait for 15 min.  Also, the game has in app purchasing and when I was presented with options to buy in game credit with real money, one of the choices was actually for $99.99.  Are you kidding me? A hundred bucks? Unbelievable!  Needless to say, I didn't wait 15 mins. when the game told me to,  I waited about 15 seconds, selected the home icon, then Apps, Delete from Device and Delete from Cloud. Gameloft really needs to re-consider if this is a direction that want to take the company.
0385536828|5.0|I read this book as slowly as possible, treasuring every word and phrase. The author has a gift for setting and character, and I have given multiple copies as presents, with uniformly positive feedback.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Love I have on my phone. Best temple run so far. It would be nice to get on the kindle fire.
1451695195|5.0|A beautifully told story that is uplifting, full of hope and great information.  A must read. Of all the writings on NDE, this is the best book I have seen.  Jim Cherry
B009AMANH4|5.0|This film is a wonderful reminder that movie excitement doesn't require gun play and blowing things up; it can just be people talking.  Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is a stand-out - but he has great company with Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones.  For me, the film improves with each viewing.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|The new version is 100x better. Keeps me updated and looks great. I use this app everyday and I love the ending soon reminders.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|this really helped me with charging my Kindle,  no more problems with it,  thanks I also told my siste about this.
B000MKD9P6|4.0|I liked this movie, but it was fuzzy and blurry some of the time and did not run smoothly through.
1612183956|2.0|My friend told me to read this saying that it was like Twin Peaks. Having just finished that series I decided to oblige him. Yeah, that was not an apt comparison. Wasn't it really fun reading about how the protagonist is physically debilitated almost every time he encounters someone. That's just like Twin Peaks, right? Well, there's secret service agents, so that's like Twin Peaks. And they both have likable characters. Well, not really. The only characters that were even remotely interesting here were the mysterious bartender and the main character's paramour, and they are only intriguing due to their air of mystery. The mystery of this book is its greatest/only strength, because it keeps your unbelief at bay. When you consider the mystery in Twin Peaks, it is disturbing, but it leaves you satisfied in a somewhat unsettling way. When Pines's mystery is revealed, you can only shake your head. At first you wonder why you didn't think of that. Then you realize why--because it's really silly. Sure, it makes sense, but I would have rather left the mystery unsolved if this cacophony of shoddy ideas would be the final product.<br /><br />If you want some weird sci-fi adventure that doesn't make you all warm and fuzzy inside, read the Heechee Saga. If you want something more like Twin Peaks, play Deadly Premonition. If you like reading about suffering and the human condition, try Lord of the Flies. However, if you want all that at once in a diluted quality, read this book. However, I honestly don't know why you would want what this book is cooking.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|All I can say is WOW!<br /><br />Kevin MacDonald did an excellent job of portraying Bob Marley's life.<br />He shared a lot with the people who did not really know Bob.<br /><br />I watched this movie/documentary twice & it moved me so much.<br />It made me; sing; shout; dance; be happy; be sad; & my eyes filled up with tears from knowing what Bob went through in his life time trying to make the world a better place for all.<br /><br />I thought there was one down side to the movie/documentary. I think all of his childen should have been a part of it but maybe they had their own personal reasons for not contributing. In all, it is still a great movie/documentary.<br /><br />Bob left behind a great legacy!!! And his children are carrying it on for him.<br /><br />If you are a collector of movies & documentaries, this is a must have for your collection.<br /><br />One Luv
B00ANY94A0|5.0|My daughter loved putting this LEGO Friends tree house together.  She is 5 and loves to do the LEGO friends sets together.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|David Mitchell is a genius; I'm impressed with his use of so many styles, settings, dialects, and types of characters. The way the different sections of this book are woven together is engaging and often surprising. Recommended!
B00ANY7V8M|5.0|My daughter loves putting the LEGO Friends together, playing them for a few days, taking them apart and starting all over again.  The directions are very easy for a five year old to do on their own.
B008MM9630|5.0|I'm into the all earth thing, like plants and animals. this game is a way for me to express that without being judged by my peers.
B0000024ZT|5.0|I've been listening to this album since the 70's, and I don't think I'll ever grow tired of it.<br /><br />This is a young Springsteen, bursting with energy, ideas, images, ... WORDS!  The music is wonderful, but what really makes this album stand out for me is the lyrics. They overflow with layers of meaning and metaphor, overt and covert symbolism, great 'quotes' from the people he is writing about.<br /><br />By the time of the Born to Run album, the songwriting was much leaner, tighter, professional.  This shows youthful inexperience and excess, but it is still wonderful in its own way.<br /><br />The word 'classic' is overused, but if any Springsteen deserves it, this one does.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a really good app. its really nice to be able to open up an app and see how long you can use the Internet.
0446573027|5.0|First of all let me say that I received this book in record time.  I think it took about three days total, which is excellent.  I had read the first pages of this book on amazon and couldn't wait to read the story and see what was going to happen next.  I got the book and dove right in and was not disappointed!  This book is really incredible.  It was very suspenseful and current.  David Baldacci does a great job of keeping you on the edge of your chair!  I would highly recommend it to anyone.
0553382179|5.0|I am a busy stay at home mom who home schools our 2 sons as well as tend to a variety of farm animals.  This book helped me get rid of the clutter and the house pretty much keeps up on itself!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is busy and doesn't want to be a slave to their home!  Her book is also written as if you and your best gal pal were sitting at the table having a chat, she is very easy to relate to. Try it and say goodbye to CHAOS (can't have anyone over syndrome)!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Women can do so many things,but we constantly doubt our abilities and undermine our own success. This book providential for what I had already assumed, but it also surprised me more than I had thought it would. I think this book will help the women in college now to take better control of their careers. Together, women can really have a positive impact on the world.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I just started this video, and while level 1 is good (that's as far as I've gotten so far), why are we not able to pass the intro that is 2.5-3 minutes of the Lionsgate logo, the Biggest Loser tag and her talking about who she is and what to expect from the video.  All this is great the first time, but we can't pass this in subsequent viewings?  I guess if I want to continue doing the workout, I'll start the DVD before I get dressed, water, weights and towel.  I just don't want to get all ready and then sit for 3 minutes waiting for the workout to start.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|An amazing album with a fresh new sound reminiscent of old school paramore! Just amazing! A true testament to the strenght of paramore
B00005N6KG|3.0|The headphones don't stay in my ears during workouts, which I remedied by using a headband to keep them in place.  Cord could be a little longer also.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good game if you like running games. Annoying that you can save yourself with gems. Other whise it's pretty nice.
