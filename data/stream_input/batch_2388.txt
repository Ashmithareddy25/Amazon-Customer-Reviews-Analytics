B007URVZJ6|4.0|I obtained this book because I have had awful formatting problems with all my Kindle books.  So this time I was armed with 2 things - this book coupled with more experience and understanding of what on earth was being discussed in the instructions.  Each time, when my Kindle books left my computer and when I looked at the preview, they were fine but not so when people bought them.  This book highlighted each of the areas of concern as you go through the process.  Then on top of that, I Googled for umpteen factors and yaaay, I think it worked.  The changeable font sizes in Kindle (at the reader end) is both a blessing and a curse, worse when you include images.  Writers need to be so careful.  Anyway, I would recommend the book but only as ONE of your formatting tools.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I love my Pro Elite controller, it's much more comfortable to handle than a slandered PS3 controller. When I found out PS3 had a controller similar to a 360 I had to get one.
B008XBCJ34|2.0|Armed with the 3-D glasses I was set to love this as the last film I saw Sam Worthington in, he was great.  He's good in this too.  However, the excellent cast, great idea, magnificent WETA work were ruined by a dreadful approach to the dialogue.  I could feel Sigourney Weaver choking on her truly ghastly opening scene.  As well, did nobody think of how awful it is to label the villain as poor old Uncle Sam (who has taken a beating lately)?  Why not clearly depict (not just 'announce') that the miners were a motley crew of guns for hire from all over the world?  Men (for there were few women) who would do anything for a buck (though what they would spend the money on beats me.  Apparently Earth was already cactus.  Nothing was made of their motivation to succeed at all costs - money wasn't enough of a storyline here as the malls were probably closed in the USA.  I know there's a message about the trees and ethnic, unfamiliar populations but it would have been made so much better had the other details been eerier, more suspenseful and not just a predictable mash-up of baddies Vs. goodies.  The 3-d is really good, haven't watched all the extra features yet but I will.  James Horner's music (complete with the rallying 5ths of the hunting horns in the battle scenes ....errrrrrrrr) was, well, probably what he was briefed to do.  But honestly, I don't see it edging the Brandenbergs of Bach off the great dinner music charts.  The closing credits song is very forgettable. The animation is spectacular and beautifully conceived with intriguing plants, trees, mosses and floating mountains.  Loved that.  However, I like my films with story and character and actually, the reason it took me so long to see this film was that I had a feeling Mr. Cameron's mark on this story would spoil it.  I can almost see the crew whooping over their corny jokes and high-fiving as they watched the rushes.  As Dame Nellie Melba said, 'Give'em muck' and (visuals excepted) that's what this is.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Don't watch with your kids. Maybe not your wife or girlfriend either. Great movie so long as you aren't worried about the reaction of anyone else.
B005NFWCSK|4.0|We were looking for something the family would enjoy. My 10 yr old likes superheroes so we thought this would be at least watchable. Turned out to be fun. Just don't expect Henry the V.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My mom like this Book because she thinks I love the book and I do but it costs $6.45 and I think kids all over the world will like it to.I love it so much it is so goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooob!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was a very good book. It was easy reading and a nice sorry. I'm going to watch the movie tonight...so i hope itlives up to the book. I would recommend it.
B00BI745AA|4.0|I liked the movie a lot.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of musicals and love stories.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I confess to loving rock n' roll from the 70's & 80's best (ELO, Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, AC/DC, Queen,  The Cars etc.) but this is the 1st &#34;new&#34; rock CD I've gotten in a long time that I really, really like. Even the songs I was not as sure about at 1st have grown on me the more I listen to them. If you like Rock, you will like this!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|My teenage son really liked this movie and seeing it on Blu-ray was even better.  The DVD is great to take on the go.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|OK story. Decent plot.  Of course Denzel Wasjington is a fine actor.  Overall it was a pretty good movie and enjoyable.  The ending was interesting.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|I enjoyed Krakauer's stories about his personal outdoor adventures. They helped me get beyond my impressions of this as a tragic story about a kid with some kind of death wish, who was incompetent about life in the wilds of Alaska. I liked the parts where the author corrected his own earlier stories, about the moose killing, and the poisonous plant misidentification. I would recommend this book to people who have enjoyed Krakauer's other books, and his search for the truth.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. Parts were quite sad. The story itself though, was very good. I'm not sure who or what genre I would recommend this book. Maybe to those that enjoyed Old Yeller, or Rainman.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book has lots of great information and has conveinced me to rethink the way I eat and feed my family.
B008Y79IUE|3.0|As difficult as Pi, but not as rewarding for me. But this is probably just a personal reaction. I think I've had one too many gritty movies set in New York.
B00138KFYO|3.0|Or I'm just burned out on her.  A few favorites, but the rest repetitive.  If you don't know her body of work, give it  try
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I loved this book. It was so awesome. I will definitely read it again and again and again and again.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is an action packed thriller that reflects current day problems. Anyone who likes to reflect on world problems would probably like this
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Love the game.  Wondering when the new version will be available.  Released on Google Play 4/18.  Can't wait!  Current version is great but excited to see the new one.  Another week has gone by with no Winkie Country update.  Hope to see it soon!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love love love this game, bordering on addicted.  I don't like that I have to buy gems, but I understand they have to make money. My 7 yo and I play this together and I also really like that. Pleased overall.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This is a British soap opera and it is quite entertaining if you are someone who likes that sort of thing.
B00004WGC4|5.0|I have this set already, and loaned it to a friend, she had returned it to me. Some time had gone by,she was going through a difficult time in her life and asked if I could send them back she needed a few laughs.  I went to Amazon and found a good deal on the factory sealed VHS version, and sent them to her as a gift. She thanked me over and over again.  I highly recomend!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an amazing game to play when you have time to kill.  I haven't found a better game yet to play when im bored
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Read the others in the series as well, great read for teen and young adults! I definitely recommend the series to those in that age range!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I first heard about the fast diet on TV and then read this book.  The author describes studies that show that this diet is healthy and can possibly increase longevity.  Five days a week you eat &#34;normally&#34; and two non-consecutive days women limit themselves to 500 calories and men to 600.  I sent my father this book (he's 83) and he and a friend are on this plan and it works!  I am halfway through another program, but once I reach my goal, I intend to embark on this regimen to maintain my weight loss.  This book includes recipes for the &#34;fast&#34; days as well as presenting case studies.  If other programs have not worked for you, this one just might!
B0018J2QB8|5.0|I absolutely love this show. It is unbelievably imaginative on the writers part. It is entertaining each and every episode. I hope they keep it on as long as possible. It is going on the 8th season and it is going strong!
B008NMT684|5.0|Very good and entertaining for a toddler and his dad. Besides it is free... go for it. Especially if you have a son addicted to vehicles...
B0094K1WZE|4.0|As with all of the Mission Impossible movies I found this to be exciting and full of action. All of the actors/actresses did a fantastic job as always.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Most Videos are in HD both on Tv and Amazon kindle. Brand new video are posted up all the time and its simple to look up videos by searching artist up.I also like the Vevo live though i dont always watch it, i do sometimes. you can look up music videos in different language too. But 1 downfall is, that you cant find underground music videos..  But you can get this vevo on your phone too or Roku as an App which is very cool..Its Also **Free***
B004D20JP2|3.0|I suppose it's okay but it was not what I had expected. Although the animation/claymation was okay for the storyline.
0786886811|5.0|Nigella lawson is a goddess. Great recipes-easy to follow. You don't have to be a gourmet chef to enjoy this.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|What a waste of time. I suspect Tolkein would be sorely embarrassed to see his creation presented as such pathetic excuse for entertainment.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is a great app. I like to draw on it. I think there are a lot of fun ways to make your drawing better. Highly recommend app and I don't understand why people gave this a 1 star rating. If 10 stars, I would give a 10/10.
B00992CF6W|5.0|We downloaded this App to our Kindle Fire. My seven year old twin boys love it. They have been asking for it on the X-Box, but we were not ready to sign up for the \\"live\\" part. This a great way for them to play the game and it is portable!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|My kindle fire shuts down at about 3% or 4% of battery life, but this app does not recognize that. Also, when ever my charger unplugs or I plug it in, it opens this app.
B000031EGV|4.0|Anything with Robin Williams is funny and enjoyable! Hilarious for the entire Family and movie worthy for young children. Three stars.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The Hunger Games tells a good story with heroism, action and, emotion. The plot is easy to follow and fairly predictable but, overall, it's an enjoyable adventure. Finally, the heroin is a female for a change!
B006LSZECO|1.0|So I read this book on a vacation and I admit it was a real page turner. I was totally rooting for the husband in the story and really was hoping for a stellar ending. In my opinion it ends in the worst way possible. I was pissed off and in a bad mood right after I finished this book. This book reminded me of the friends/family I have in my life who are with the wrong people , but they are never going to get out of those bad relationships. The people with the really sick, unhealthy relationships that are somehow still addicted to each other.<br /><br />I was expecting this book to be &#34;so good&#34; and really it just had a bunch of surprises and ended in a horrible way. Left a bad taste in my mouth. If I want depressing and messed up, I read the news.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Wonderful story ....I really enjoyed it......The author made some of the scenes so realistic that one could imagine being there.<br />A great story....Taffy
B007ZXK08C|4.0|It was a really good read with lots of twists and turns along the way which are unexpected, including the ending.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good book but wish there was some more action to it.  Also would have liked to know what happened with the proceedings of Armani  mines. John Grisham is a great story teller and I am never disappointed with his books. Keep up the great writing!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book mesmerized me, I couldn't put it down.  Chris Kyles method of luring you into the story, making you feel comfortable with all the military lingo, (he explains it to you) is remarkable.
B00BS4QP60|5.0|I just love this album. I use many of the songs to workout to. Its a fun album to listen to.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awsome book! I love it so much! You guys make the best books at fist i didnt like them bur now i do
B00136NYR6|5.0|This recording has been referred to as one of the best from Bob Dylan.  I agree!  Tombstone Blues is one of my favorites on this album.  If you don't have this in your collection, and you are a Bob Dylan fan, don't delay any longer...Buy it now!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Great to see how others in the story of all the holiday icons are put together to make kids happy.
B005OK721G|5.0|I recommend this movie if you enjoy action and a good story line.  There are some non-believable segments, but hey, it's a movie, meant to entertain and not a documentary meant to inform. The heroin cons her way to America after witnessing her parents murder, and she starts on the road to vengeance.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie overall as well as the book. I would recommend people who have just watched the movie to read the book.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Hannibal is everything required by the title.  It is eerie, suspenseful and provoking.  I like the way I am drawn into the crime scenes by the empathic talents of the lead character.  Hannibal lurks in the background manipulating, leading and controlling at every turn.  It is everything that the title implies.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book was great. I have this one and another one on my kindle. All the others are on my bookshelf
B004TTHLBE|3.0|yuk!  There are interesting moments that I won't deny but overall the book is a meandering lot of thoughts clumped together in what could be a bunch of short stories.  Short...very short and for me this does not work as a book at all.  More like a comic book clumped together to sell in book form.  How is HBO going to make this work?  We will see and I hope that it works.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Vdjcdbhfhejgrifgwjzvehvxevxhwvxsvcjrxjgfgddgdggghhh to keep the people who want to kill the best way to be harder than the rest of New Orleans hornets the best I've ever played a a search on ave the young teens free movies that are assumed the best
B004L03B3S|5.0|I think this is an awesome film... controversial topic but more than what it appears on the surface.  I enjoyed it.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|If you liked the movie this is the soundtrack for you. It has a majority of the songs that were in the movie.
B00BF11STU|3.0|What a disappointment after all the good reviews. I guess that, in this time of so many \\"reality\\" shows on TV, viewers have come to expect that nothing much will happen until the last scene. The only part of the movie that had any energy was the night in OBL's compound. I enjoyed seeing the cool 4-eyed night-vision helmets (not the technical term). But that's about it.
0142418471|5.0|I loved the book, the story, everything. Read it in two days! Both authors do an amazing job!<br />The book arrived perfectly!
B005LAII12|3.0|This movie was not as I expected.  I didn't care for the seemingly constant barrage of cursing.  The story line was good, and overall the movie was okay.  Definitely NOT for children.
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|Loads of these types of books these days, and many of them fall into the same tap of sermonizing. The authors do a great job of establishing their framework and pricing some practical applications of their work. It would be great if they pursue interviews with individuals who put this to work and demonstrate results rather than relying on other, previous, research to justify their work.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am obsessed with this series.  The cinematography is amazing, the actors all superb, and the storyline is intriguing.  I will watch this season again!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have not read a Tom Clancy book in a long time .This book involves cyber espionage and high stakes international intrigue involving the Chinese .It is relevant  considering the recent accusations of this against the Chinese involving industrial cyber espionage.This  goes further  as the Chinese are infiltrating  our military and defense  computer systems sending us to the brink of war.<br /><br />The  story is well developed  with lots of action and suspense .There are multiple characters developed  which also lends  to a well written novel.strongly recommend this book  and look forward to the next Clancy  novel if it is this good .I would rate this book a 4.5 stars
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read about Gone Girl in the media, and thought I´d check it out. I´m normally not too fond of crime books, but needed something to get my mind off things.. I think Gillian Flynn writes really well, and it´s quite a page turner. I´ll probably buy her next book too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched it over and over! Love it! Great buy for anyone that enjoys Downtown Abby. Keep you wondering what's going to happen next.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Great CD...very old school which is refreshing. Remix of some old sentimental songs, Clapton adds his special touch, style which make them even more enjoyable.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I've been an avid fan of Dexter for quite some time. How a father and blood spatter analyst can become a (bad guy) serial killer has created a most interesting character portrayal. The series grabs your attention and will not let go. You'll always be wondering what he will do next. He certainly spends lots of money on plastic sheeting and duct tape. :-)
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|A lot of fun, cool graphics, and always entertaining when you eat the swimmers/beach people,this game is fun fun fun.!!!!:)
B0025KVLS8|5.0|This CD was a gift for a friend and when he got it, he was very happy, and has been playing it constantly. It arrived on time and neatly packaged. I would definitely buy from this seller again!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app. I definitely recommend this to everyone. I play this like all the time. It is awesome. I think everyone to get it. You don't even need e instruction
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Loved by my 3 boys: 12, 5, and 3yrs of age. Keeps them busy and having fun for hours. They actually can all play together without fighting! Haha! Great game for the younger ones to learn to spell and to expand vocabulary for the older ones. Great purchase!
B00001OH7Y|5.0|I had almost forgotten this gem which I have on vinyl, but hadn't played or seen locally in a very long time.<br />I jumped at the chance then, to purchase it on CD. And I was not disappointed.<br />The title track which Bowie covered live to great effect on his Serious Moonlight Tour, will get you rocking. As will such classics as Fashion, Kingdom Come and my personal favorite, Teenage Wildlife.<br />Its an album which; as with much of Bowie's work; opened new doors to the world of rock.<br />And I highly recommend it to old and new fans alike.
B002SEW5WW|4.0|The CD arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition. Our family is enjoying the album (except for one song that I notice has foul language in it). Still, the other songs are great and I'm glad I ordered it.
B00070DK5K|5.0|&#34;David Live&#34; was recorded in Philadelphia during the Diamond Dogs Tour, and is in my opinion one of the best Live albums ever recorded.<br />The sound is spectacular! And Bowie's vocals come through crisp and clear, and leave the listener with a clear vision of the man on stage.<br />One could never imagine the band performed hidden away backstage behind a giant curtain. Their sound, led by Earl Slick, is nothing less than perfect!<br />This album is a &#34;must have&#34; for any Bowie fan and new listener alike!
B0001AUAU4|4.0|The CD arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition. I'm enjoying the album as it assists my efforts to learn French. I'm glad I ordered it.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am really enjoying the case.  The only thing I wish I had is a place to keep my pen.  However, I put all of it in a sleeve, so it works out fine.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|this series is adicting - so much so i had to get the 3rd season before it even ended in the U.S.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is really good good I love the style sound and fish it's so awesome I love it I give this game a 5 stars too
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD for the whole family. I purchased it for my library. I'm sure I will be watching this DVD again and again.
1885167776|4.0|I enjoyed this book and it was an easy read. I didn't find any of the concepts new or original, but a great reminder on how to stay focused and continually look for the one thing you should be focusing on.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Gut wrenching, paralyzing, moving. So so real. I am humbled, and as such, restored. Oh death, where is thine infamy?
B007W8S2MG|3.0|People are probably going to get upset by my review since there are plenty of diehard RPG fans out there that love this game. I, for one, was not all that interested in this game but decided to give it a try since all the reviews are so positive. Given that I'm NOT an RPG fan, I didn't have many expectations. I like strategy games so I thought P4G would be a good game for me. I played for about 5 hours but just couldn't get into it. The story is interesting but the combat seemed very repetitive. If you are on the fence and you are NOT an RPG fan, you might want to try this on a friend's machine first.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the new update will have the same potions as the computer version but it will add all new animal such as donkys and horses I hope u enjoy!
B0054S6N04|5.0|This book had me laughing, crying, squirming with the sexy teasing, and trying very hard to guess the final mystery. I loved the girlfriends hanging together, the humor of the geeks at work, the inner office conflicts, and the love-hate relationship with the new neighbor.I loved growing up in a neighborhood where you know everyone on the street and you take pride in a really good car detailing. The friendships, the relationship conflicts, the hassles of work, the sexual attraction and banter, the wise cracks and the underlying scary, horrible threat and violence have made this one of my more recommended stories to my friends.
1451637500|4.0|I think it was a bit forced, but there were some different ideas developed which made it enjoyable for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I told myself I would read the book before I watched the movie but never got the chance to get the book. But I eventually watched the movie before the book, clearly not as planned but after watching the movie I loved it even more. I bought the book that night. Loved everything about it more than the movie. So now I'm on my way to buy the second book! I'm so excited!!
0439023521|5.0|I always like young protagonists.  This was great even though it stretched credulity more than once. Looking for the nest episode.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best books I read this year.  It's a gripping read - perfect summer or travel reading.  Great modern sci fi.  I recommended it to friends after reading about it in slate.
0553573403|3.0|I got lost in determining where some of the action was taking place.  Much hopping around and fantasy elements not believable
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|The app was very fun,it had soothing music .It teaches about the ocean .But you could only go to far until you had to pay for stuff
B009PK9SB8|4.0|pro: clear picture, good colors, light, doesn't seem to drain battery as much as expected<br />con: can't see anything in sunlight, even when shading with hand
B0042J6VUS|4.0|Is quite a bit to small for a Android Razor HD. The height adjuster was too short/small by at least 5mm. Other than that it will work well with most phones(probably not most smart phones). The legs feel solid and stiff enough to hold whatever you put on it, the ball swivel seems tight enough, but the adjuster above the ball swivel seems to be the weakest link. I have not had it fail, but the gear is plastic and is meant to hold the tray for the phone on tight.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Can't get enough of this series.  Still not sure about Mr. Cruise as Reacher, but the movie wasn't bad.  Book is very good.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A sobering creation of a world with lots of surprises.  Well written, engaging, thought provoking.  Reminds me a bit of Lost.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|I was hoping for some character development but none to avail. Not great. Has funny parts but there's no real meaning.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Not much to say it's awesome.<br />It makes no sense that you require to include a minimum amount of words in the description.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Great story, not soaked in gross teenage humor, and a good message of the human tendency to judge with our eyes and not with our ears.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Not much to say it's awesome.<br />It makes no sense that you require to include a minimum amount of words in the description.
B00516G5W0|1.0|The figure I received the green in his outfit had three different shades of green. Shoulders, part from chest to waist, and under waistband to shins... the green is different shades. I know it said color may vary but damn I thought it would mean comparing one figure to another not certain parts of the individual figure. If the color was fine the figure would be great since color doesn't chip like cheap stuff. I can't put a figure up to show it off if its different shades.
B0053O89WY|5.0|It's awesome.<br />It makes no sense that you require to include a minimum amount of words in the description.Thanks fellas!
B008OW1S3O|5.0|love it. perfect music for driving. i like every song, the music, the quirky instruments, everything about it.<br />i sent a cd as a gift.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Not much to say it's awesome.<br />It makes no sense that you require to include a minimum amount of words in the description.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Found this show by accident on BBC America and am hooked. Lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing. I usually don't like police shows but this one is very well done .... can't wait to see how it all plays out
B00684J49U|5.0|I'm a big Grey's fan.  I purchased this DVD to add to the rest of my Grey's  Anatomy DVD collection.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Have watched several times. Love the story and performances although Russell Crowe would not have been my first choice. Would purchase again
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I did enjoy this book, a very interesting proposition of memory loss and who do you trust!  It is an easy read and I would recommend it.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this app is great except the fact that the customers get extremely impatient .it could get really addicting.I hate how the extra players cost so much!!!!! but I still recommend this app to hello Kitty lover's like me!
B005DF2QMC|3.0|This USB tape player did the trick for about a year. I converted several tapes, mostly baseball broadcasts and a few music and news airchecks, and it did fine (as long as I kept the volume up, as I discovered that if the volume on the device was low, the output would be low as well).<br /><br />After a little more than a year, I noticed that tapes seemed to take considerably longer than 60 or 90 minutes to complete, and that the music sounded slower and the announcers sounded a bit drunk. It seems that the tape player can no longer regulate its speed, so now I will need to purchase another one. (Someone who wrote another review for another USB tape product suggested getting a good standard tape player or tape deck with audio outputs and a standard \\"Y\\" connector, which I haven't had the opportunity to try yet). All in all, I guess the device was worth $25 but I wish it would have lasted longer.<br /><br />The best thing about this USB tape deck was that it came with Audacity software. After I got this tape deck I got a USB turntable (an ION pro which I am very happy with) which came with easier to use but by comparison notably inferior conversion software. It didn't take me long to learn how to use Audacity, and I will say if putting your old tapes and records onto your hard drive is a hobby of yours, the best thing you can do is learn how to use that software.
B0039P1O4O|5.0|I have only had it two weeks but so far it does what I needed hands free access to my phone calls.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|This case is perfect for my kindle. It looks cool and protects. It's not skin-tight on the kindle, which is fine for me, but those who want a form fitting case should keep that in mind. It's simply a really good product.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Loved it an amazing story beautifully written. Lots of colourful discriptions that just took one into the moment and times of Pi. Wonderful.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What a great story....and I did NOT see the ending coming at all.  You fall in love with Jamie and Lily....
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Loving it so far and I would make recommendations to friends and family. Amazing easy to use and I like the full screen feature.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I checked my email today to find an apparently permanent preview panel,which renders the formerly useful one-line summaries not so useful any longer. Unless there is a way to hide this panel -- and I've checked the settings  -- I won't be using this app, which is a shame, because before this blunder I preferred it to the native app.
B007V4QK02|5.0|So this is an amazing album. The only problem? It's not available through the MP3 store. Amazon, what's the problem? I need this on my cloud drive like pronto.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|We enjoyed the movie in the theater, so we had to purchase the video so we can watch it over and over again.
B0035JNTA6|3.0|Didn't care for the movie. There were a couple of funny parts...but it was mostly stupid. Not surprised though, most movies with Will Farrell in it are not that great
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a thoroughly engaging show with lovely production value. The wardrobe is luscious and Elizabeth McGovern as Cora is an unexpected surprise.
B004IPPINW|4.0|I liked it really I'm not kidding you can take my word for it what's stopping you lisaten up turkeys
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Alien was so out of there when it came out.  Sigourney Weaver was so great.  As they say, Psycho in Space.  All the rest build up the suspense.  Watch them in order first without commentary then with.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is a good app if you like to keep your ppl informed and ez to post photos that you take to your phone
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack is hitch hiking from the last book and gets picked up by three people.  He's in pretty bad shape.  Something is not right about these people.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A must see series! This season is just as good as the last, maybe better! Can't wait for next season!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game!  Excellent graphics and puzzle-making.  When it ended I was bummed out.  Like everyone else wrote, I wish it was longer.  Can't wait for the next installment.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Love the leading actress and how she can play several characters. Looking forward to seeing where this story line goes!
0812993357|5.0|If you are a fan,you will love it! If you are not.. you will love it,she is very charming.. Read about the fashion world through her eyes.
6305603847|5.0|Great movie. To some it may look dated or old & some may have to watch it more than once to understand the story... But I had seen it when it first came out & still like it just as much if not more...
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I really cannot wait for the full version or the whole album. Still I haven't stopped dancing since I bought this.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|This app is great for sketching on the go. Its a lot better than carrying around a pad and a bunch of writing utensils.
B007SGM084|4.0|When you want a mindless read, this is a perfect fit for it! Sometimes I don't understand why the characters do the things they do, but sometimes their irrationality is what makes the story gripping.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie was very tastefully done.  I like stories from the time period it was set in.  Men were gentlemen, and women were ladies.  For the most part they were very respectful of one another.  Men were honorable and the ladies were virtuous and pure.  It was a sweet love story.  Good stories don't need a lot of trash like movies have in them today.  This picture was excellent.  Full of emotion and genuineness.  Yes, I've told others about it and would recommend it to more people as well.
0380715430|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - I enjoy all of this author's books - even when I read things that contradicted my understanding of English - and language in general.  I was disappointed to learn that there are so many errors but, nonetheless, for an enjoyable read, a basic insight into language and introductions to grammar, words that fail to become common, word games, etc., it is still a book worth getting (I was given it as a gift).  Read it, enjoy it but do not take it as gospel.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Best Movie from the time period it's set in.  Jane Austen was a simple yet wonderful writer.  Beautiful love story.  I fell in love with Colin Firth watching this version of the movie/ story.  He was so convincing (as Mr. Darcy) when showing his love for Elizabeth ! He was truly the hero ! Like the prince in fairly tales.  What a man ! The other actors in the movie were also \\"Top-Notch\\", and delivered marvelous performances.  It was an all around very enjoyable story.  (However, one needs to watch it a few times - without discussing with other people in the room - because one must be careful to really LISTEN to all of what the characters are saying - as the dialogue can be difficult to understand at first (Old English).  But once you get the hang of it - it can be quite pleasant to listen to, and it CAN be understood. (This was the FIRST movie of its 'type' I ever viewed - so the 'language' did take a little getting used to.) But its not a problem any longer.  Yes, I have discussed this movie with many a person and would continue to recommend it to all I discuss it with.  I think they should show this (and other similar movies from the time period) to students of English Literature in the school systems - it wouldn't hurt to get a little 'culture' in these youngsters, you know.
B007V4QLY2|5.0|This older album of Pink's is great.  More of a rock feel and edgy. She didn't get the love in the US for this album like she did in the UK, but every Pink fan should own this!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I knew this would be a great movie, so grateful that this man made JR Tolkins books into movies. The second explanation disc was fun to watch, how/who did what, the areas they scouted, gorgeous country.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|My grandkids love this app but twice now it has frozen after a few days.  I have to keep deleting and reloading it so they are never able to earn enough points to unlock any of the other players.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Great cast, great shots of LA, I always enjoy Matt's movies, and this one is right up there.  Definitely recommend this one.
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|Great story in this trilogy. I luv this author n wish he had lived longer to write more futuristic stories.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Another mystery game that I can't stop playing! It's just one of those games that you want to keep playing and find out what is next! I am really getting into these types of games and so far this is a good one!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Tired of FOX and CNN?  This news sevice covers the globe and no right/left crap.  Just the news,  also all subjects,<br />world, national, tech, medical  you name it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I find this game very infectious. Once I've started to play it I find it very difficult to put it down. I really enjoy playing this frustrating game
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's hard to put down once you start.  My kids love playing it too.  The only downfall is you never reach an end.  Different levels?
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Excellent description of the why and wherefore of habits. Clear and actionable ideas well presented. At the core; amazing insight.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Creative storyline.  Interesting characters.  The  Hunger Games kept me up late reading!  It  was very difficult to put it dwn!
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Once I learned WOTE were releasing their debut album, I wasn't going to settle for the digital-only format; I would only be satisfied with the physical CD. And of course I was. It came sooner than Amazon predicted it would, which was a great surprise. It came perfectly packaged and with no faults at all.<br />The actual content was wonderful. It was filled with the aura of the WOTE personality. The songs are without fault (save maybe a little swearing, but I can ignore it in this case). Admittedly, I was a little surprised by the other songs that were included (I'd bought the R.E.V.O. EP) but now they're constantly playing in my head and I can't complain about that.<br />If anyone has any musical sense, they will love this album.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is an amazing series and I have found that everyone we tell about it has been just as excited about it as we are.<br /><br />If you like action and intrigue this is a great watch!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Oh Pinterest, you cause me to lose LARGE blocks of time, as you suck me in with all your amazingness..............
B00785P2QC|5.0|This app is very fun and addicting. I love it. Very cool. I love how I can personalize it just my way. It'd be cooler if you could rotate before you build
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I find this game frustrating on my Android. It is slow and cumbersome, and there are other games I enjoy more, sorry
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|This can be a useful app for me when I learn how to print what I've written. If you can help,that would be great.
B000OWC2QE|5.0|This showed me and my sister how the eco system worked together. I really enjoyed this imax. I hope you do too.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a good rainy day read, but very predictable in what would happen. I bet you can guess even from the title the premise and the outcome.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have seen the play 12 times and have also read the book by Hugo, so my expectations were not very high for this movie.  I was also unsure of the actors being able to pull off the music.  I was so surprised and happy.  It was fantastic and I highly recommend it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Enjoy the game, but do not like the Facebook scrolls on either side of the screen. Makes it hard to concentrate on the game. Also, is very hard to earn tokens to trade for Bingo cards.  Need to be able to earn more credits faster. Biggest issue is that you don't get to daub the last number called and 9 times out of 10 you would have had a bingo.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|The entire movie was amazing but the ending when everyone started singing and everything was my favorite part of the movie
B009WO7NQO|3.0|The game is fun but I beat all the levels I like 2 weeks and don't believe all those people who say that you have to pay twice with one payment I got like 50 levels.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Five stars.<br />Brilliantly written,very deep and heart wrenching story.  I read all three books of the<br />Trilogy.  I definitely will read more books from this author.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|If you are approaching the age or are the age of 40 and have more than one child in your home, this movie is hysterically close the truth of everyday life. Good flick!
B005VPRFSY|5.0|Great kit. I was missing two tiny pieces that really didn't spoil the model. I knew I could rely on LEGo for fixing this quickly. Refreshishingly good service.I also like the implicit value that such tiny things are basically free..even the best packers can make a mistake and this is reflected by the company not charging anything. Great company, great ethos...I'm buying an X-wing right now, just to show my support. Great Danish company. (I'm from  London but live in PA.) Lego is huge in Europe,folks. You can't go wrong.BUY IT FOR YOU OR YOUR KIDS!!lol.. please try one kit,, never had so much fun in years.x
B005GG0MIS|3.0|This was a great read through the post war years up to Johnson and the beginnings of Nixon. From then on the Presidents Club becomes a bit dull.  Very shallow from Reagan onwards in terms of events.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|He was well known elsewhere and did not know it. Can you guess where he was well known? Check it out.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|The reviews are correct. This is a very entertaining and charming story that just compels you to keep reading. I enjoyed the ride.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love this app because it keeps me totally up to date on weather. I will have to say that I liked the previous format better than the current one though. It was easier to use.
B001F6TXME|4.0|This item is what it is supposed to be but I really wish it was longer.  An extra foot or two of cable wouldn't add that much to the cost.  Still, everything Nikon is expensive so I guess this is what you would expect.
1608862801|5.0|It's ADVENTURE TIME! Join Finn the Human, Jake the Dog, and Princess Bubblegum for all-new adventures through The Land of Ooo.<br /><br />The totally algebraic adventures of Finn and Jake have come to the comic book page! The Lich, a super-lame, SUPER-SCARY skeleton dude, has returned to the the Land of Ooo, and he’s bent on total destruction! Luckily, Finn and Jake are on the case...but can they succeed against their most destructive foe yet?

B00947N6D8|5.0|I Loved This Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It makes you feel like a kid again with all the good feelings of childhood!<br />One you don't want to miss!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Of course you need Ebay. I use it a lot and is a must have for my family. I like it on the kindle just because the size is bigger than my iphone. Definately a plus app!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show. It is beautifully shot and every detail of production is spectacular, the sets, the costumes, all of it. The Earl and his family are so wealthy and elegant that the show oozes luxury and class. The story is actually quite like a juicy soap opera or reality T.V. show only with a lot of polish on it. I don't feel guilty when I wonder who is going to do what stupid/evil/shocking thing next the way I do when I watch The Real Housewives. The show is amazing because so few characters are actually likable. Somehow the overwhelming number of unlikeable characters makes the few seem even more valuable and I keep watching to make sure nothing really bad happens to them. It is entertaining T.V.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Such a good movie. It was recomenned by a friend. So finally watched it. Very true I can see it happening, a little far fetched in some scenes but this movie makes sense with what the world is headed to!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good book. It was hard to put down. Kind of eery - especially with so many things going on in the world and country today, and how the government continues to control more and more things in our life. And, with the government doing more things without its citizens' consent, it's not too far of a leap. Definitely an original take on what they are willing to do next!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|the best app ever!! got to love it. from new songs to old this is amazing. If you want lyrics there there and if youve heard a song and have been searching forever SHAZAM ROCKS!!
B006885EFE|5.0|This was a great series in general.  It gave me a greater understanding of what some of the men went through during WWII.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone especially if they are looking for some history on WWII, mainly D-Day paratroopers and Battle of the Bulge and many more battles.
B004IAIXWK|5.0|I would recommend watch it over and over. What's not to like its Channing and his wife at the beginning. Amazing movie. Love it! nicely put together!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app - always improving.  Has many versions of the Bible and great study plans.  I recommend this to everyone.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Pretty much a no brainer. FB is a great site. I don't like alot of the changes but that's part of it. I wish they had age restrictions because it causes way to much drama for young adults.So yes I like it.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|More options would be nice. I enjoy the self timer option. More editing options would be nice as well such as color and cropping.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|My daughter just didn't use this app because her Iphone was easier to use and not as big. So realizing what apps are good for what you need.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. I'm always looking forward to the next season. I would reccomend this Tv series to all my friends.
B008KO8KZ0|4.0|Ok so my daughter used this app for a bout a week and then just boring. Of course a lot of laughs at first and stuff. but after a bit it wasn't amusing like when you first get it. Not really worth it unless you want a short lived laugh.
B000B8L6LI|4.0|All you need is one more extra fine stone, (to produce shaving blades).<br />I like it, I recommend it.<br />Enjoy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is awesome. and its cool and I love it. And I'm on level 10 and on level 10 you can ride the monkey
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It takes my mind off of things for awhile.  I am overloaded with thing as most adults are and this is just a no brainer try game.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Although it was slow moving at first, this series quickly picked up momentum and turned into one of the best I've seen! Excellent cast, fantastic writing. This show is not to be missed!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|No clear ending! I don't like that! I needed someone to win!!!  Now what?  I wanted Nick to get out of this with his baby.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|The series, the quality, and price were great . I  told others where I got it so they could purchase a set
B00B2166BS|3.0|The magnets are strong and it charges. I just don't notice that it charges as fast as all the write ups I've seem about pogo chargers.  I feel its a safer way to plug in your devices.  If the plug gets hit while plugged in, you don't run a risk of damaging your charging port, plug, or both.
B007EW6GX2|5.0|My kids like scary bedtime stories (they are 8,7, and 6) and this was an amazing version of a classic tale.  It really was written with the original in mind - it's not your average, dumbed-down Frankenstein book.  Mary Shelley would be proud!  We love the Great Illustrated Classics Series.
B0091VYG86|5.0|If anyone remembers the movie Pleasantville, it's worth another viewing. I loved it when it came out, but just watched it again, and it's one of the most thoughtful and poignant stories of the price of repression and fear, all wrapped in a cute and funny fable. If you haven't seen it, you MUST search it out. If you've seen it before, take another look.
0671449028|5.0|This book became part of my daughter's bedtime/book time routine.  Very cute illustrations.  She's 3 now, so she's on to more &#34;big girl&#34; books
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Great book awesome description and the the best plotline ever<br />You should read because of these three reasons ok bye
0452295548|5.0|This changed many things with the way I treat my Dad. He is like a baby again but somehow I see knowledge there. I know his mind and body needs rest now so I will help him with daily care when he is asleep.  I only wish his body wasn't failing him. I read the book to him for inspiration and did many of the things that GG did to help Jill along with therapy. Its been a hard ride, I'm willing to take it further if God will allow.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|For beginners, I love anything Sparks.  Of the 4 club members we gave it  three thumbs up; one person did not like the &#34;Jo&#34; ending.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a very good book! Keeps you hooked from the very first word! So many crazy twists! It's very deep and sometimes heartbreaking & powerful!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|The sound quality and selection of songs was excellent.  Filmed in a Southside Chicago Blues Club, it gave you the &#34;feeling&#34; of really being there with the rest of the audience.  Every musician was totally together, in sync, and the siingers were at their best.  It just had the right &#34;vibes&#34;.  I discovered how great MoJo Buford (on the blues harp) was on this DVD.  He played his heart and soul out on this DVD, and I really believe he was the best Harp man that Muddy Waters ever had.  I still have to watch it often to experience this totally great blues experience.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a big fan of sci-fi. When I started this book it seemed like a fallout knock off and the setting seemed limited but as I read I fell in love with howeys writing style and the characters he created. It felt like a punch in the gut every time something happened to a character. I recommend this book to any lover of sci-fi. It is well worth the read.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|We're all just a collection of habits, but once you recognize and learn to manipulate the triggers and rewards habits can be powerful harbingers of change.<br /><br />A couple of be examples are forced, but overall it's thoughtfully put together and cohesive. Overall, it's a solid, fast read and a solid introduction to the subject.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like pop science books, this one is a great inclusion.
B00AAQ7JNA|5.0|&#34;Excellent&#34;
B008B1VYP0|4.0|The first three songs are great and really speak to me. The music is well done, and reminds me of my dad
B00ANGICRE|5.0|&#34;Excellent&#34;
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Excellant purchase.  The Hobbit is a GREAT movie....exceeded my expectations.<br />I love the extra DVD, too, and will treasure both!
0807014273|5.0|This book is so powerful that is spans not only psychology and psychiatry, but also Philosophy, religion and spirituality, ethics, and much more. This book intended to merely be a book on psychology, but it turned out to be so much more. Viktor Frankl, a successful Austrian psychiatrist, spent 4 years in the Nazi concentration camp system, including a stay in Auschwitz. He used his experiences there to construct his theory of logostherapy. Frankl posits what man is really in search of is not power, or control, or even survival, but meaning and purpose. He writes about how we can find meaning in even the worst of circumstances and events. He claims that life is inherently meaningful in every situation, even awful ones. And at every point we have a choice as to how we wish to respond to the circumstances, a radical freedom of the will. This is a wonderful testimony to the human experience of life on this earth.
B000001GK0|2.0|As pointed elsewhere this recording has all the bad traits that are attributed to Karajan. Not coincidentally was recorded at a very low point of his career alongside with hundreds of digital re recordings of inferior quality that their analog counterparts. For example the awful beethoven cycle of the 80s<br />why Karajan is more prominent than Zimmerman in the photo?  Karajan was a living legend at that moment.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Just beautiful! Highly recommended to all fantasy fans. Fantastic landscapes of NZ + a right amount of CGI did the job. Makeups and costumes are beyond reproach also.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is good but there's some twist and turns that will Impress you and help you in politics in the future
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I think I would enjoy watching Johnny Depp watch paint dry. His characterizations are always scene stealing. I am a fan of the original Dark Shadows soap opera and this is certainly not terribly faithful to that. If you look at it as a stand alone movie with a nod to the past show I think you will enjoy it more.
0307277887|1.0|I love reading, and I love the Dexter series, but this book was painful. After reading only a few chapters I had to put it down which I have never done before. I always finish a book but the author's writing style is that of a fifth grade student. Short choppy sentences, multiple grammar mistakes, and poor vocabulary. This book was so painful, save yourself and just enjoy the series. Showtime did an amazing job and it is absolutely worth it!
0374531269|4.0|This book was very difficult to read because it was a very personal story told through the eyes of the victim in the corruption in Africa. Ishmael Beah writes in detail of his personal experiences as a child soldier and describes what he witnessed and his feelings as he grew older. There is so much intensity in the imagery that develops from his descriptions, and it makes you feel as if you are being told his story in person. The description of war in the book was so much more painful and gruesome than I originally expected. War does not have the same connotation and feeling as we feel living in a place where we don't go through events such as those faced by Beah. In the book, Beah is helped by many \\"civilians\\" or city people and he is slowly able to recover from his traumatic past and nightmares, it suggests how working together can be such a beneficial thing for everyone because it proves that humanity does exist. I feel that this story shows how corruption can lead to more corruption no matter where you are. Violence grows and can turn people around easily for sake of each person's own safety and survival.<br /><br />This book explores the other experiences and perspectives of war that we rarely are told. Perceptions of war are so different for different people in different parts of the world, and Beah explains the reality of what a war is really like in Africa as a child soldier. Highly recommended for any globalization class because it allows the reader to think of the story in a global perspective and try to understand how differently people think and live across the globe and what it means to be in war. Also makes the reader think how such events have a global impact and how it is relevant to us.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This is a very unusual story about a spiritual young man who survives an incredible ordeal at sea. When you get to the story's end, you may find yourself going over it in your mind for days, working out the details. Visually it is gorgeous and awe inspiring at times. A friend who saw it on the big screen said it was even more impressive, and I can see why. But it carries over pretty well to the tv screen as well. Parts of the story are full of adventure as young Pi deals with the tiger on board and brutal storms at sea. I think this movie was difficult to market. It is not a story for little kids about animals, etc.. It is pretty heavy duty philosophically and spiritually. Some of the events may even be too disturbing for young children. Maybe 12 and up or a bit younger for mature kids. If you like to think, if you enjoy philosophy, if you seek God, if you are open to the stories and perspectives of others, you will enjoy this film. It is very well done.
B002XWXPC8|3.0|Just okay.  Parts were funny, but not on my &#34;will watch again&#34; list.  Plenty of better and funnier movies out there.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Pretty fun and addicting. Hard to stop playing once you start. It is one of the better city building games that I have come across. Would recommend others to try it.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat. A++++ Very good. The real thing action But it you will like it!
0446892882|5.0|Sugar indeed has proven to be the scourge of society. Duffy examines how sugar made it in to the western diet and brought with it many diseases that we accept as simply a part of life. No so! Read this and you will probably not want to eat sugar.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Has trouble saving high quality pics, if crashes or takes a really long time. Even though the pic I'm editing was high quality to begin with.
B002UQ46M0|5.0|keeps your mind going in deep thought  never knowing whats next  ege of seat  got to have all 4 in the series
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this , I have not been able to use it that much, because I need to read up on the use.
0979019710|5.0|This simple book has given me great insight into how to practically create the best life possible, IMMEDIATELY! What a wonderful program! I can't wait to share this book with my clients and friends!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I just so happen to be a big fan of Daft punk. I've always liked their music, especially &#34;Discovery&#34; and this single seems to match the tone and joy of their more funky earlier works. Anyone that has liked a Daft Punk song before will likely enjoy this single.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Easy to read, although I had to read some sections two or three times to understand it completely. Mainly because I am a complete beginner to computers and writing. Everything you need to know included and lots of links to other info.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, it was created beautifully and I have found very little bugs in it. It's very user friendly and is easy for any age! 5+ stars!
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Highly recommend it.  It had an interesting story line, and I loved that it was based upon a true story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best running game for Kindle fire better than temple run all the  ccharacter selections it keeps my little brother calm
B007THA4FI|4.0|Very different from what was expected, many complex characters and reminiscent of the darkly psychological writing style of Elizabeth George.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|It took me awhile to figure it out (& that's just because I'm slow, if you know what I mean), but once I did, it was great!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I loved the plot it had me guessing and changing sides the whole time I was reading.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|What I know of history, it appears that Lewis really captured the essence of Lincoln. I would recommend this movie to all age groups. Not sexual overtures and minimal profanity
0596805888|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loves it!  He has learned so much about food and now is very confident in trying random concoctions!  they always turn out well
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome but I think they should make it like the real version we should demand them to make it so it's like the computer  version whoever agrees Wright something like it
B008476HBM|5.0|This book has passed the test of time and makes for very good reading. I would recommend it too the newer generation.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I've been watching this show since it premiered in 2005. Jared and Jenson are very talented actor's who work really well together I'm a huge fan of supernatural... I'm so happy to hear they got a early pick up for season 9.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i like it, its fun and something to do when your really bored,and is good for all ages. you dont really have to do much for it but its free,fun ,for all ages, and something to do.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Its just OK when compared to other FB spps for the iPhone. I would not have purchased it had I known of its limitations.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I am admittedly a fan of this author and Harry Bosch. This book continues what I enjoy about these books. It is well written and fast paced. The development of the interrelationship among the characters makes it more compelling. A very satisfying novel.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I don't know many people who would buy a season of a show if they didn't already know they liked it, so... while it's an awesome show and I've basically had it on repeat since I bought it, some people find Zooey a bit annoying (I don't at all), so if you've never seen it before, watch an episode or two before buying this. Although it's pretty cheap anyway.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's the weather channel.  Weather, maps, and more.  What more could you ask for.  Map movement a little slow to load.
B00B1TJO10|5.0|I purchased the hard copy for graduate statistics courses a few years ago. While writing the dissertation the digital copy has provided an ability to quickly access key information while writing components of the chapters, a great plus. The hard copy is wonderful and includes the SPSS CD. Increased efficiency during the writing process is the benefit of Investment in the digital copy, in my humble opinion.
B007REV4T8|5.0|like all the others james bond movies this have everything to stay in front of the tv hours watching this....
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Of the FB apps available to the Kindle this is the best of the lot. Works very much like the PC and iPhone apps.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Ah yes...I have reached that age where I am purchasing re-released versions of albums I wore out when I was a teenager.  I was lucky enough to live, and follow the whole grunge movement as a teen. I listened to this album a lot in 1995 and loved it, and longed for more. Fast forward 18 years and I hear a rumor, and a whisper in the dark of a deluxe edition with NEW tracks!! I couldn't have been more excited.  Mark Lanegan's vocals are great on the new tracks.  McCready's guitar whales once again, with Barrett Martin providing his unique and excellent back beat.  A huge bonus is the live DVD with 5.1 surround sound.  A real gem.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Good coming of age, book but everything is the best most rare amazing thing that happens to our hero.  Decent open.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I have this app on Kindle &amp; Android phone. Very comprehensive information but SO SLOW to load with latest update.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Can't add anything beyond the reviews posted here. The story stays with you for a long time. I ended up recommending it to dozens of people. A lot of them have read it already and the reaction is always the same: &#34; I loved that book!&#34;
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This was received in 2 days (wow!) and I got to see it this weekend, so I know it's not defective.  I know I'll watch it over and over...!
B006HL9G10|5.0|I mediatate daily and love this app which logs the time I have mediated, times my practice and also give me a \\"community\\" of others who mediate and groups to discuss meditation.  There are \\"badges\\" that put on your profile for mile stones of days mediation total and consectutively.  It's motivating to get some badges for your profile and to talk with others who can help you go deeper into your practice. I absolutely couldn't live without this app.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy access to everything you need while on the go.  Buy, list sell and monitor all transactions.  Essential for the eBayer.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Anthony Hopkins captured Hitchkock.  Good movie.  Helen Miren was excellent, too.  I highly recommend the movie to gain insight in the movie business of the '60s.
B009ICYPOS|4.0|I received this as a gift from my wish list. Although I am an enormous fan of Rowling's Harry Potter series (my all-time favorite books), I did not enter into reading (listening to) this book expecting it to be in the same tone as the Harry Potter series, or with the same mass appeal. I assumed, correctly, that Rowling would go to great lengths to present herself as an entirely different sort of writer, one with breadth and flexibility, and not aiming to please a large audience. I think she accomplished that in spades with this novel. It seems clear she only wished to tell a story in her own way, about her own point of view on human nature, and without any regrets.<br /><br />I must admit I was a bit taken aback with the rawness of the characters and starkness of the storyline as I first began to listen. As the story progressed, I became engrossed in the depth to which Rowling developed the inner-workings of each character. The people, ranging from toddlers to teens to grandparents, may not have been saints--and some were downright wicked--but they certainly felt *real* to me. In fact, I frequently felt amazed at how some of the secret thoughts and feelings of these characters were in tune with my own experiences.<br /><br />The reader, Tom Hollander, did an excellent job voicing the characters and bringing them to life.<br /><br />I do not recommend this book to the reader who wants more Harry Potter, nor to anyone who wants sunshine, roses and happy endings. This book may be a good match for you, though, if you enjoy diving into the minds of its characters and working through them and their lives from the inside out.
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|We ordered this set for my son's kitchen area. He loves them. The wood construction is great and they are durable. Comes with a pan, a pot, one lid, and plates, forks, spoons. An amazing little set.
B000002J2F|1.0|Dispite the fact that MISUNDERSTANDING IS A STOLEN SONG from from Sly & The Family Stone's 1969 hit: [[ASIN:B00137Z22A Hot Fun in the Summertime (single master)]] by Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford had an album out called [[ASIN:B0000073I5 Smallcreep's Day]] with Anthony Phillips on keyboards, while Tony Banks has an album out called [[ASIN:B002NV9AH8 Curious Feeling: 30th Anniversary Edition]] with Chester Thomson on drums. Phil Collins had a Brand X album out called  [[ASIN:B000X8NGXC Product]] where Phil got most of his sound effects from, listen to the song [[ASIN:B000X8NGQE Wal To Wal]]. Then the sound effects on Behind the Lines went on Genesis founder/guitarist/writer Anthony Phillips' [[ASIN:B002ZCFO2A 1984]] in 1981. Steve Hackett had [[ASIN:B000TDG8L8 Defector]] and [[ASIN:B000TEPIIQ Spectral Mornings]] Peter Gabriel had [[ASIN:B003ZZAXFO Peter Gabriel 3: Melt]] where Phil played drums on the 1st track [[ASIN:B0043XUXTS Intruder]]. Anthony Phillips' \\"Sides\\" should also be looked into as the song Nightmare was used to make Man Of Our Times. On top of all that Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins played on Robert Fripp's solo album Exposure, so evidently this band was no longer a cohesive one just three solo acts. Even Mike Rutherford said it himself on the Genesis on Duke interview \\" If it weren't for the solo acts\\". THE POSER FANS CAN'T FACE THE TRUTH!
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Bruono is a guilty little pleasure that I have.  Loved \\"Do-Wops and Hooligans\\" and was excited when theis recording came out.  I don't think it's as good - maybe too rushed?  Anyway, it's still fun and has some catchy tunes on it.  Glad I got it.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Game was extremely buggy on my KF.  Constantly freezing on game startup and during game. I uninstalled and re-installed hoping that would fix things, but I lost all of my progress.  Game also requires Facebook link if you want to interact with other people.  Uninstalled permanently and back to Dragon Story, at least it doesn't freeze every other time.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was entertaining and thrilling.  Follow Bilbo Baggins in this adventure.  It was a prequel to the Lord of the Rings. The action never stops for long. All of the mystical creatures from Middle-earth such as Dwarves, Orcs, and Goblins, as well as Gandalf the great Goblins are revisited. Finally, it leaves you wanting more. Remember that this is only the first episode in the trilogy and there are two movies yet to come.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|i  found it beautiful, sad, and real, yes yese,yse.the<br />this is stupid, why should i bother to write and waste my time
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was one of the best books I've ever read! It in itself truely is a Wonder!!!! I will never forget it!!
B000002NZO|5.0|Anthony Phillips put out a solo album in 1977 called [[ASIN:B0030C8OIK Geese And The Ghost]] Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford also play on the album and it sounds similar to Trespass!
B0027P2ZWC|4.0|I had read an article in The Nation magazine which talked of Victor Hugo's details of the sewers in France during the escape scene in the novel Les Miserables.  I am ashamed to admit that I had never seen the stageplay of Les Mis, had seen some mini-series of the past and read the book at some point in school but don't remember when.  We saw the latest movie and I wasn't overly impressed and HATED Russell Crowe.  Anyway, after reading the novel (3 weeks of diligence) I was rather obsessed with the story of Les Mis.  So, I wanted the recording of the songs but didn't want to hear Russell Crowe sing so found this version which has the concert of the songs and it's great.
B00000JMOF|4.0|Frankenstein is a must-see film for horror movie fans and classic movie fans who like 30s to 40s stuff. It is the phenomenal work serving as the basis of Frankenstein films, theater performances and animation films that has been produced since then. So when you talk about Frankenstein it is 1931 film from which our long-held image of the monster came. When the movie was released for the first time the audience must really have been scared but today's horror film fans who are overburdened with scary stuffs such as Aliens, Zombies, Vampires it may not impress so much. Also it was the dawn of talkies when films with real actor's voice was still new. So the drama sounds as if thatrical performance was extended into a movie. The reason the film is viewable for modern moviegoers is mainly because of Boris Karloff who made an excellent performance as a monster created by Dr, Frankenstein by using murderer's brain. Part of the classic movie was refeatured in Spanish film [[ASIN:B009VO9XSG The Spirit of the Beehive (Criterion Collection)]]at the tragic scene of a little girl meets the monster. The monster and a girl enjoyed playing but suddenly the monster threw her into the pond and the girl drowned to death. The monster was so shocked at what he has done. That scene really is a great scene how this movie made into a classic. Much of the movie may be predictable at best but it was because the film has so much influence over even today's drama.<br /><br />Verdict: If you love Boris Karloff this is it<br />Rating: 77 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Classic horror film fans and movie fans who like early stuffs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it makes you think and remember and learn responsibility. I think this game is awesome. I think everyone should have a game like this.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|was good , but i have seen the play in london, have the old sountrack and the 25 yr. aniversary performance. these are hard to beat, but movie gives it some details that i missed in the play, or it was not the same story
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I LOVE Pink she is amazing, even more amazing live! She is such a talented singer, and funny!<br />I recommend this digital booklet,definetly worth the money!<br />a+++++
B008CPRLP2|5.0|In my opinion It's a neccesary app to download files if you receive compressed files or if you want reduce your files
B008220C38|1.0|The casting was bad, the directing was bad, the production was bad, the acting was bad, and the attempt at making an \\"artsy\\" film flopped.  I was so disappointed at the way the role of Anna was played that I found myself looking forward to her throwing herself under the train.  Anna Karinen is my favorite book of all time, and this movie did not even begin to do it justice.  What a huge disappointment.  I'm glad I rented it instead of buying it.
B00154GEFU|5.0|For music fans who enjoyed music from 1980-85 it is not easy to find new materials from 80s rock masters unless you constantly check the internet for respective fan sites. Recent Asia releases since 2008 are good place to start for 80s music fans who lost touch with such type of music.<br /><br />Asia's 10th studio albums turned out to be a boon to 80s music fans who love first three albums by the band who are made up of the members of Progressive Rock Giants. The opener NEVER AGAIN is such a pompous pop rock just like HEAT OF THE MOMENT from their debut album in 1982. Third track HEROINE reminds me a bit of THE SMILE HAS LEFT YOUR EYES. ALIBIS is another radio-friendly song and the album closes with excellent sing-along ballad AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE. The album also contain nearly instrumental sequence from SLEEPING GIANT/NO WAY BACK/REPRISE and the cover of globus's ORCHARD OF MINES from their 2006 album Epicon.<br /><br />Verdict: Truly the extension of Asia's first three albums<br />Rating: 91 out of 100<br />Recommended for early to mid 80s rock and pop music fans in general.
B00123BCKQ|5.0|I've heard this artist on the coffee house for the last couple of years and just now bought his music.  These Streets is great all the way through, I love it!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The 3-D is awesome. I have a 70 in LED TV and it was a fun movie to watch.<br />When friends come over and want to see what the 3-D looks like, I show them this movie.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good cast and clever writing (especially the jokes about Hollywood and movie makers!). Even though we know how actual events ended, the screenplay was suspenseful.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I just built my first APU system and I gotta say I am pretty impressed. For $120 you get a high speed, quad core CPU and an okay GPU. You won't be playing any really current games at maximum settings with this, but you can play on medium just fine. The primary user of the computer plays World of Warcraft and it plays that very well.<br /><br />Great CPU/GPU for a home computer/low end gaming computer. Can't beat the price. Is not sufficient for a true &#34;gaming&#34; PC.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very easy to use. met my expectations I play it all the time. you will too if you like this game.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|It gives an inside view of politics during Lincoln time and a better understanding of our popular president.<br /><br />Today's politics has not learned from the past.  They continue to create new ways to make themselves more important and wealther at the expense of the American people.<br /><br />What a very complicated man Lincoln was but his most endearing features are be mumble, straight talker and ambious man without taking away from our country.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|great game really love it cant stop playing been up all night playing ma lil girl plays it to and really enjoys it
B000FFJYB6|4.0|I thought the book would mirror the movie much more than it does, but it only gives passing references to what the movie develops more fully.  Nevertheless, Morris is very descriptive in his writing about the geography of his small town in Mississippi, and also the central theme of how our pets become part of our lives growing up.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|So happy to have a new CtR game. it's very imaginative and fun. I hope they keep up the good work!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easy to use and keeps you wanting more if you love the coin machines at a carnival then you will love this game. Best yet its free!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game, just wish updates would come faster for kindle fire users...I love being able to play with family and friends on Facebook.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|The movie will make you laugh ,and cry ,and love the actors..........There are a few twists to the story line that will keep you glued to your seat ,and enough surprises to keep you guessing....This one is a keeper.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The most original book I've read in years. It had me up until 3am several times. You don't have to be a lover of sci fi to enjoy this story of Katniss Everdeen, a role model for all teenage girls. She is brave and would sacrifice everything to protect her family. The firt book in the trilogy is by far the best, but the other two are compelling as well, you will be dying to see how it all turns out.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|I had already bought the \\"Love Never Dies\\" cd without knowing about the deluxe edition... I absolutely love the soundtrack for the songs performed by Ramin and Sierra... I may not care for each song on the cd, but most of the songs are beautifully written and recorded... Of course that is also the opinion of a huge fan of Ramin and Sierra's voices. Also a lover of the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\"...<br />Since I was looking for comments reguarding the deluxe part of it I will let other reviews help you on that and stick the deluxe part of it.. the additional footage because no one had said anything about it until I looked in the forum discussion...<br /><br />Truthfully it is mostly of Ramin, Sierra and Andrew Loydd Webber in the studio talking about that aspect of it.... The are lyrics included in liner notes which explained more of what the settings where behind the songs.... I think it is probably a must have for Ramin and Sierra fans who love to see the behind the production stuff as I do...So to me it was worth it. However, those not interested in that stuff you would be just fine to go with the non-deluxe edition.... I hope this helps...<br /><br />Whether the soundtrack is any good well that is all in the ear of the beholder.... And these ears love what they hear, and by far even more than the voices from the movie soundtrack with Ben Lewis and Anna O' Bryan which is also lyrically a bit different from this version....
B003OUXECE|4.0|If you haven't played the series yet, read this book first.  If you have, read it anyway for more back story.  As with any book compared to a movie or game-play, it tells you more of everyone's perspective and sheds light on why things happened the way they did.  Not a bad book in my opinion.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I've been playing this app for a long time and now these weird glitches. I've spent a lot of time playing this app and all that hard work went to waist.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love dhis app ,,it's a best app to get in touch w your friends I always been texting on the app
B002ZG97LK|3.0|It's hard for me to watch this without being too judgemental, Footloose was one of those touchstones of my teenage years and the performances in the original are so ingrained in my mind it's hard to watch this new version without making comparisons. To me the acting seems a bit off and there are some elements that were changed but at the same time they stuck so close to the original script I almost got a sense of deja-vu. A bit disappointing for me since I can't shake the memories of the original but I think a new generation, seeing it for the first time, would probably find it just as entertaining as I do the original.
076790592X|5.0|learn a great deal from them.  They have crossed the bridge we have yet to cross.  We as young people should always listen to what they have to say.
B001EJGQTU|5.0|Extremely interesting revisionist history.  Highly recommended for history and politic buffs. The film goes from WWI to the Vietnam war with chronologically the 11 lessons learned through his experience as the Secretary of Defense.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I remember reading & watching the news about the Iranian revolution ransacking the US Embassy in Tehran back in 79 , This movie is based on a true story adapted from a Novel Master in Disguise where 6 Americans manage to escape just in time and take shelter in the Canadian consulate with time running out before the Iranians figure out there's 6 people missing and becoming suspicious of the Canadian Consulate Tony Mendez ( Ben Affleck ) is a C.I.A Agent who specializes in difficult escapes and comes up with the idea of going undercover as a film crew making a  fictitious Sci Fi Film titled Argo so Tony Mendez and Fugitives hide in plain sight pretending to be the crew where the slightest mistake could end in instant death .<br /><br />This is a really good Thriller with great special features :  Picture - In - Picture Eye Witness Account - Rescue From Tehran : We Were There with President Jimmy Carter , Tony Mendez and hostages recount the real life harrowing bad experiences they endured - Argo Absolute Authenticity  - Argo The C.I.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This book keeps you wanting more and more. I can't wait until the next book. Once again a great read.
B004QYTRRS|4.0|I liked this movie because it didn't get too violent-although it could have. Also it didnt get too sensual either. But mainly I liked it because the story line and plot were through the roof! Great writing and imagination!
0802473156|3.0|I wish I had read this book before I lost my husband of 18 years.  I think it might have saved our marriage.  I was reading him all wrong as was his interpretations of me.
B001O2QW9G|5.0|Grandson is obsessed with turtles and tortoises. Perfect size for little hands.  Loves this because he can carry it around. Enjoys putting it in his wagon for a ride. Fun for him  and fun to watch him play with it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game just had the right amount of creepy while still being super fun. I loved every second, the only downside was is that I t had to end. Definitely worth it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As a person of faith, I am always drawn to stories about nonbelievers whose experiences bring about a new direction in life. The description of meeting his sister and the scenes of another realm are very affirming. I was unable to follow the medical descriptions of the workings of the brain, but all in all, I was glad I read the book. I wish him much success with the Foundation he has established to further explore the subject.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I bought this book after my fiance and I decided to do Whole30 (we had heard great things from others). The authors do a good job of explaining the science behind their program and the book is so conversational, easy to read, and actually funny/entertaining. As for the diet, we're on Day 20 right now and feel fantastic. As instructed, we haven't taken any measurements or weighed in so I can't speak to the weight loss yet but I can tell my fiance is losing weight. (My goal wasn't to lose weight and while I think I have dropped a few pounds, I am trying not to lose too much.) A lot of the authors' quotes stick out in my mind, particularly &#34;Don't tell us it's hard...quitting heroin is hard. Having your coffee black. Is. Not. Hard.&#34; That quote has really gotten us through the moments when we've wanted to whine about missing certain foods.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|They can't fit the whole book into a movie or even a mini series but they should at least follow the story.  There are scenes that are obviously not in the book that who knows what they are about. If you enjoyed the book save your money. The movie is a huge disappointment. I gave it two stars because there are some scenes that were in the book.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I love Shania Twain.  I probably have everything there is of her.  The more I read, watch, and hear I love.

B007W8S2MG|4.0|I managed to beat this game (with max social links & seeing the true ending) just yesterday & thought I would do a review of my own. I know that these 4-star reviews typically get negative scores for whatever reason (a 4-star review is a POSITIVE review, y'know), but all I ask is that you take the time to read this review before passing judgment on it.<br /><br />The mechanics of this game (as for its prequel, Persona 3) are extraordinarily unique. Instead of your typical &#34;Fantasy Warrior must save the princess & the world&#34; story... well... you do get that story in a manner of speaking, but it is told in such a unique way & in such a unique setting. Get this... it takes place in the REAL world. Crazy... I know. The real world isn't the game's only setting however, it is just the setting that you will be seeing the most in your time with the game. Persona 4 also features a secret world that you can only access via entering a TV (see, I told you it was unique). This TV world is the area where you will do all of the games dungeon crawling, that thankfully, is rarely forced upon you. All of the dungeons within the TV are randomly generated but at the same time feature a theme surrounding the character that you are going there to rescue/capture. A few of the themes that stick out immediately in my mind are Heaven, A Strip Show, A Love Castle (just play it to understand) & my personal favorite... the classic RPG dungeon.<br /><br />The battle system is amazing (evidenced by the fact that I actually beat the game) & keeps things interesting until the very end (unlike most turn-based JRPGs in my experience). Instead of the annoying random battles of several games, you can see all of your enemies on screen. If you can sneak up behind your enemies & attack them before they are able to react, that gives you initiative & allows you one whole turn of free attacks. When it comes to the actual battles you can either attack directly with your character or use your Personas. You Personas all have specific abilities that are useful in certain fights. See, every enemy in the game has strengths & weaknesses to specific types of attacks & your various Personas make defeating those enemies a bit easier to defeat (in fact there are even enemies that you literally can't defeat without the use of personas as they are immune to physical attacks). You may be wondering how to get these personas... well the answer is also through battle (& fusion... which I'll get to in a minute). After a battle is complete you will sometimes get the ability to do Shuffle Time, which is a process in which you pick cards to decide what rewards (or lack thereof) that you get for winning the battle. Unlike Persona 3 (if I remember correctly) this isn't random. You can see every card available & choose freely... certain cards offer permanent stat boosts to the equipped persona, others offer health restoration, skill cards, Personas & the ability to sacrifice varying degrees of something from the battle (exp, money, items, etc) in exchange for the ability to pick more cards. You may ask why you'd want to do this.... well if you are able to get every card on screen, this will result in sweep bonus (which not only results in the ability to keep all of the cards you selected during the current Shuffle Time, but a guaranteed shuffle time in the next battle as well as starting out with the ability to pick 3 cards instead of one (which also GREATLY helps you continue getting sweep bonuses & therefore continuing the process).<br /><br />Social links return from its prequel & are just as big of a part of Persona 4. For those that don't know, social links are the points you get for hanging out with the friends that you make throughout the course of the game. You may be asking what is the point in doing the Social Links? They are just side quests, right? Well.... yes & no. Technically you don't have to do the social links (the game would be kind of boring if you didn't though),but they have actual effects on the combat portion of the game as well. See, by doing the social links you rise up in rank with the Arcana that the friend in question represents. This effectively allows you to to create more powerful personas through the fusion system (& by that I mean that the personas you create get automatic stat boosts), create the ultimate persona of said Arcana once you reach Max friendship level with them & in the case of your party members make them much more effective in battle by giving them new skills & allowing them to evolve their persona into a stronger one at max friendship (as well as allowing them to obtain their ultimate persona & skill if you hang out with them AGAIN afterwards).<br /><br />The only flaws that I really can point out are the optional dungeon (which basically sucks all of the fun out of the battle system) & the story. It's not so much that the story is bad, as there is just too much of it at a time. Most of the time, you won't encounter the main story for anywhere from a couple of in game weeks to a whole month at a time (which can be very good or very bad depending on your preferences) but when it comes time for another main story segment, instead of spreading the story out over the course of say a week, they just throw it at you in a gigantic block of text over the course of a day or two. The worst part of this is that in the majority of those situations, the scenes are mostly random, serve no point to the overall story & are rarely (if at all) mentioned again. One such scene that instantly sticks out in my mind, just from the sheer absurdity, is the scene where the group are on school break & visit Yukiko's family's inn to spend the night. While there, the girls in the party decide to use the bath. Seems pointless & random enough right? Well...<br /><br />MINOR SPOILERS ABOUT A PARTY MEMBER<br />then Naoto walks in... after which all of the other girls proceed to basically RAPE her. They comment on her breast size (which I call BS on. No way could any human being hide those things that effectively) & on how smooth her skin is.... then use it as a way to proceed to touch her. This on its own is a bit creepy, but when Naoto proceeds to say the next line... things get WAY too creepy for my taste... &#34;Where are you touching me!?&#34;. The look on my face through this entire scene (which I am sure was priceless) was nothing compared to it when she uttered that line. Then to top it off, the boys come into the bath (which we later learn is because it was actually their turn to use the bath... riveting stuff... I know) which causes the girls to respond by calling the boys perverts & attacking them. What is wrong with this, you may ask? I dunno... maybe because those hypocrites were groping poor Naoto just seconds before in literally the exact same scene.<br />END SPOILERS.<br /><br />Was that scene random? Incredibly. Does the scene serve any point whatsoever? No. Is it ever mentioned again? THANKFULLY NO.<br /><br />One last thing I feel I should mention is the way to get the game's ultimate weapons... dear god is it random. Basically, you open 20 chests (which will be signaled by the sound of the chains rattling) & then, without moving to the next floor of the dungeon, open another. If you are lucky (or really unlucky depending on your party & level) you may face the reaper. I would not recommend even attempting this fight before the weakest member of the party is at least Lvl. 70. If you do manage to defeat him you get a member of your party's ultimate weapon as a reward. I certainly feel that the method of obtaining your ultimate weapons could have been handled perhaps a little better, but that is only a minor blemish on this otherwise great game.<br /><br />Overall I would still say the game is well worth playing, especially to the game starved Vita gamers such as myself, & I do still highly recommend it despite what I personally see as flaws.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.e (which I call BS on.

B0074VA2T2|4.0|My 3 year old really likes this app. I wish that the levels would progressively get hard by itself. You currently have to change difficulties by hand. Not a big problem, but I have to switch the levels after a while to keep my son's attention.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Cut the Rope was amazing and this is even better!! As someone who finished all levels of the original Cut the Rope, I was looking to have more game time with my favorite little green monster. This app is great!!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|A great &#34;album&#34; to keep in the car to keep the delays manageable.  Great tunes and I'm looking forward to purchasing<br />another of his albums.
B009AMANH4|5.0|If you are an American history buff this portrayal of Lincoln during his last 4 months of his life is very inspirational.
B000QDYQQ0|5.0|Too bad they don't make movies like ALIEN anymore. I don't have to say much here. Only that I enjoy adding this to my Amazon catalog.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Great. For kids! Fun and will test how fast their skills are! Well worth it for free. Fun for all ages.
B007V4530A|4.0|If you enjoy listening to an occasional TED Talk & aspire one day to speak from a TED stage, then this eBook is for you.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|I dont know how many times we have watched this over and over and over. Its a great family movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game functions flawlessly, and the graphics are very good. The game does everything I want, and it is free. One can't ask for more...
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is freaking cool. I LOVED IT. I THINK IT IS SO COOL.if you don't have it or haven't played it, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BLCHZC2|3.0|Yep, another British-accented period series.... I am sorry, the plot, script and even the majestic scenery was not enough to entice me to watch it.
B006WB7IN8|3.0|Some really good parts but some is a bit contrived. It won't suit everyone. Keeps you wondering to the end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very nice and clean looking calculator.  Does exactly what I need it to do. No complaints. Thanks for a very much needed item for the Kindle Fire HD!
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|This book can make you happy and sad at the same time. I am in 4th grade and I needed some help from my mom to understand some parts.  But I still enjoyed it.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|If you are a true fan and have read the books then you know this movie is nothing like the book.  Bet JR is disappointed in the movie as well
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|I love movies with supernatural loopholes and, like Jennifer's Body, this has a very good loophole.  I found myself actually caring about the people.  The detective has a hard job in this movie as he deals with like anyone deals with a stressful situation.  This is a fun ride and worth the price of admission.  I saw it at the theater twice, rented it on demand once, and purchased the non Blu-Ray when it came out.  When the Blu-Ray came out I up graded and I'm not sorry.  This movie is fun and well worth the time.  Enjoy it in Blu-Ray if you can!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Great series covering almost everything in stunning detail and historical accuracy. I am a history major and luckily I watched this during spring break so I could binge on it.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Some concepts which I should have known such as regression to the mean can have a powerful impact but I've often overlooked it.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Never saw the series when aired on network. Glad I am able to catch up on Amazon. Would highly recommend.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Workes pretty well, but is a bit strange to operate. You have to touch and hold the file you want, then select to play or download. It is very fast after it does get the instruction to download so it does its job quite well after you figure out the wierd operatinf process.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|using 12 gauge speaker wire from a yamaha RX-V995 5.1 receiver to a pair of Yamaha surround speakers.  i found the connectors easy to use - they work fine and are recommendable.
B001CEE1YE|4.0|I'm not going to review the movies themselves, but I will review the Blu-Ray transfer which is excellent.  The first Matrix movie is every bit the groundbreaking sci-fi movie that it's always been.  It's amazing to actually see sweat beading on Neo during the interrogation.  Good stuff, gooooood stuuuuuf
B000ELJBAK|4.0|I am a huge PInk Floyd fan and I lean more towards David Gilmour than Roger Waters. Some great songs on this album that will stay in your head for days.
B001POXA02|5.0|The watch is very rugged looking and the black color is flawless. It runs perfect and so far keeps perfect time,<br />The band fits perfect the clasps work the way they should and is very comfortable. I have had  seiko divers watches in the past as well as Swiss watches, and for the price, time keeping and durability- Seiko wins out
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Another of the many toons now made more for adults than kids but has strong voice actors and an ok plot...along with a few laughs along the way.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|While this game has a lot to offer and fun to play when it works, I was a few thousand gold from the great white and the game reset losing all my progress in the game.  My email to support was also disappointing because the response was, \\"I shall make sure to notify the testing team of the issues you have experinced(sic) on your Kindle Fire.  Sorry again and all the best.\\"<br /><br />How about at least returning my progress to the Tiger Shark?  Jeez, I spent hours getting to that point and after reading the other comments on here, sounds like it will just do it again.  It is also strange that it doesn't reset on people on the Reef Shark but only on those people that are getting close to the end game.  Just another \\"Free to Play\\" money grabbing game if you ask me.
1400052181|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Loved it! How could her family remain uninsured after all she gave?! What a great lady.
B002NPY7E0|5.0|I love this movie.  I always have.  From the creepy kids in New Orleans who are tap dancing outside, to the gated elevators that are going down, and the nuns that instill fear instead of hope.  I love this movie.  I love taking this ride with Harry Angel and I love the boundaries the movie chooses to cross.  I love watching this movie even more in Blu-Ray.  It's rare that a movie speaks to me in such a way that I'll watch it over and over and over and over and it doesn't seem to ever get old.  I love this movie.  The blend of music and visuals assault my senses and make me wonder who is Mr. Cypher?  LOL<br /><br />For what it's worth, I read the book 'Fallen Angel' by William Hjortsberg and I found the film to be better than the book.  This is extremely rare, of course.  It's funny that the movie actually makes a couple of corrective references to the book that I just laugh at now.
B0000025ZF|3.0|Too much Roger Waters for me but I needed it for my Pink Floyd collection. Some okay songs but most are over the top.
0345479092|4.0|I really liked this book. I am a first time mom so I read everything I could get my hands on prior to giving birth. I really liked that this provided a plan of action and step by step method to follow. It calmed me. Once the baby arrived, of course, the step by step plan went out the window, but I still use a lot of the tips and ideas from here.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME!!! THERE ARE 2 SONGS THAT I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT, BUT OVERALL, AEROSMITH IS BACK FULL STRENGTH. STEVEN TYLER STILL ROCKS!!! ALSO, REGARDLESS OF SOME OF THE PETTY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ALBUM, IT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A CLASSIC. A LONG AWAITED COMEBACK ALBUM FOR ME!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|What an amazing book!  Intense, thrilling, read that  I couldn't it put down!  This is a must read for all!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Read it one day.  That says it all.  I was totally taken in by the characters and the mystery.  Read it.  You won't be sorry.
B000JCSBU0|1.0|Do not watch. Just drugs and no plot. I didn't make it through the whole movie. Just disturbing and dumb.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Godfather I and II are some of my all time favorite movies. With this blu ray conversion the picture is fantastic and the lighting looks way better than the dvd version.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|To all you scribblenauts fans out there, this is the game for you on the Kindle Fire . It's remixed levels are awesome. You've just got to buy this app.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Very good movie! Very good book! Good all around! Any fans of the L.O.T.R. movies will enjoy this. Martin Freeman was an excellent choice for a young Bilbo Baggins as well. The only potential downside is the movie isn't as serious as the L.O.T.R. trilogy and is much more kid friendly, but if you're looking for that: more power to ya!
B00BESJYAY|2.0|It was ridiculous.  The movie played about half the way thru and then began to cut off it would freeze up, then it would come back and freeze up again. Again and again this happened
B0056CUZRA|4.0|I found it had my attention throughout the book and I enjoyed the way the characters would built and how they were interwoven.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book.  It took me a few pages to get into it and figure out what was going on, but then after that I was hooked.  I love that it was narrated by &#34;Death&#34;.  It was interesting to hear about life during Nazi Germany told from the average German citizen's perspective.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love Pride and Prejudice no matter what, but this movie version has the best Mr. Darcy ever!  No one can compete with Colin Firth.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|great game. very fun and a great way to kill time. one of the best online trading card games ive found
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am way too old to be addicted to this game but it's fun and I love all the options. I wish it was easier to obtain gems and energy.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is loads of fun and will keep you &quot;hooked&quot; for days!  Reminds me of some of the games I've stayed up for hours playing on Kongregate.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Director Ang Lee is getting better and better in telling stories.  The blu-ray version of the movie will bring out the best of a great television set.  The movie was so well made, two plus hours went by very quickly.
B0087EACJK|2.0|I downloading this game based on other reviews. I deleted the game the same day because it got boring after several levels.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I was slightly worried when I ordered this product because it had had a few negative reviews, particularly in regard to it's sturdiness and comfort.<br /><br />Well, nothing has broken and it is very comfortable for me. However! I am not a big person. I am a smallish-medium person. A big/tall person might find the pack a little small for comfort.<br /><br />The bag has four zippered compartments, not counting the main one. Inside the main compartment the bumpers can be rearranged easily to best fit your equipment.<br /><br />The only things I didn't 100% like were the fact that the elastic cords on the front are only decorative. Hardly anything can be safely held to the bag by them. And the side pockets have a fairly small velcro closure, meaning that things can fall out of them. I don't put anything important in them.<br /><br />Other than that, very good value. I'm sure I'll get many more years of use out of this bag.
B00BF123WG|3.0|I think director after so many years could have picked a better actress for lead role. movie was paid more attention to her then fact of the story
0060919760|4.0|good discussion of what is important in one's life experience - how a person is affected by negative experience & how it affects their ability to make non-judgemental or skewed judgements biased by negative unhealthy behavior experience. It shows how one 'thinks' - is how one will live - make their life meaningful for them... not affected by ill or ill-advised people who have affected a person's experience.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|Even thought they went a little overboard with the gore and body count, this is one of my favorite &#34;sequels&#34;. Also, the fact that &#34;Terror In The Aisles&#34; is on this bluray makes it an even bigger plus, because that movie is nearly unavailable and I don't own a VCR to watch my VHS copy! Awesome buy!
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Good read by an interesting chef. Quick read that held my interest from start to finish. Looking forward to reading his other books.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game. My 5 yo son likes it and so do I. Good game all around.

B004NOH9LC|5.0|I loved it!!! Best cute, funny, movie Ive seen in a long time!!! Great cast, funny and amazing!! Im glad I joined Amazon prime :)
B003O86FMW|4.0|A good read, makes one wonder.<br />Maybe this is quite relevant to today's world ?<br />Out of the Hunger Games Trilogy it was the best.
030758836X|5.0|I finished this book Tuesday. I've been sitting on this review for five days because I don't know how to write it. Yeah - me...at a loss for words. I assure you, my readers, this is not something that happens often.<br /><br />I cannot say with enough emphasis that every person I know (or don't) should read this book. I'm even nagging my husband to read it because I MUST discuss this novel with someone - soon!  Why are there no literary reading groups in Clarksville, TN??? (Mom, Dad - are you reading this blog???  READ THIS BOOK - we have to talk about it!!!)  It is, hands down, the BEST book I have read in quite a long time. The writing, the plot, the twisted internal conflict, the lengthy disturbing monologues, the sociopathic diatribe of the characters - all FANTASTIC. Fantastic feels cheap as I write this; words fail me.<br /><br />I want to harp on the writing here - well written. Just. Well. Written. A colleague and I discussed Friday how neither of us had any use for a book, regardless of plot, if it wasn't well written. This book is impeccable. The language, the vocabulary, the sentence structure all in unison for full effect of the plot, which is also, well, fantastic.<br /><br />Amazing Amy has it all, except a man. She's spent her life being the focus of her parents very lucrative children's book series based on her.  She IS Amazing Amy. And you will love her, and then you will love to hate her, and then you will love her because she's just so damn smart you can't not love her - the tennis match is endless, or maybe racquet ball, far more intense than tennis. Yes, racquet ball - angry, sweaty, slamming the ball off the wall to the glass and then BAM! hit your partner in the back of the head angry racquet ball.<br /><br />And as Amy lives her sad little \\"poor me\\" life, Nick Dunne enters. \\"Just one olive\\" Nick Dunne. Dashing, perfect, smiling, Mama's boy (his mother still peels his oranges and cuts the crusts off his bread even though he's well into his thirties) Nick Dunne. Nick loves Amy. Amy loves Nick. Life is grand.<br /><br />Wait, no one wants to read that book, because frankly, life isn't grand. It is blessed, it is doting, it is caring, it is cruel, but it is not always grand. Enter destruction - Mama's dying. With this life changing event looming in the air, prodigal son (sort of) Nick must return from New York to Missouri (a risk made much easier by the fact that the online industry has killed off the magazine writer and both he and Amy are currently unemployed- side note...super glad I received this book in hardback rather than on my Kindle or I would have felt like a hypocrite reading it). Mama's dies  - you saw it coming. No one uproots their lives for an ailing parent that's going to make it. But, Nick wants to remain in small town USA, slipping back into his old life, his old self, and most notably upsetting his new wife.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it folks, Amy is pissed.<br /><br />Read. This. Book.<br /><br />From the book cover:<br /><br />On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made with Nick Dunne's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick Dunne isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams and the slope and shape of his wife's head, but hearing Amy through flashbacks in her diary reveal the perky perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media - as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents - the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter - but is her really a killer? As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister Margo at his side, Nick stands by his innocence.Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was left in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife?

B004X6PRO6|4.0|Very interesting look into life of A North Korean. Truly gives you a view at how people can be manipulated into being brainwashed to believe anything.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I have listened to this album countless times since I bought it. I was not previously a Macklemore fan, but now I am!
B00002DEBW|5.0|this recording/remaster was great! this is my personal favorite of  RTF thanks for having it available for purchase. i really enjoy it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is good and it brings and tests your reflects and very very very very fun to play with friends to
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|Merlin has been a series that I have enjoyed from the begining and this is the final season of the show. SyFy chose not to air the last 5 episodes so I was chomping at the bit to get this. Apparently they upset a large fan base because they are going to air the last 5 episodes this May, but why watch it now when I now own the complete season in blu-ray and can see the whole season WITHOUT comercials LOL.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Words cannot express what an impact this movie has had on me. First off, watch this movie, it will not dissapoint. This movie has some of the best acting I have ever seen. Once I got to the end, I was so into it, that I became an emotional wreck, and found myself standing on my bed hanging on to every word. I think I reacted this way because while watching this movie, I am reminded of my own trials of high school. Charlie, like me, began school with few friends, and was completely lost. I saw myself in him so much, and then all his friends left for college, once again, I am reminded of my life. I recently left high school for college and now am totally lost again, and never see any of my friends, not even seeing my best friend of nearly a decade since graduation nearly a year ago, and we live a whole 20 minutes away, and go to school a whole 45 miles apart. This movie takes that feeling of loneliness away. It reminds me that the stars align perfectly, if you believe in it. There are so many deep meanings in this movie, and the story is phonominally scripted. I have not read the book, but I can almost promise you that when I do, I will read the ENTIRE book in one to two days, because this story is so well crafted, I find myself wanting more. It really felt like these people were apart of me, as crazy as it sounds. The acting was just that good. Watch this movie. It is a drama, but its a love story, its heart felt, inspiring, and an emotional roller coaster. Even if you were not the kid who had to spend the first few weeks of high school eating alone, and only developed a friendship with a teacher, you will find something in this movie that you can connect with. Hands down one of the best movies, if not the best, I have ever seen. This is a movie that is so inspiring, I can't stop thinking about it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing it may move faster but that is part of the fun I love it alot
0743518144|5.0|Marcus Buckingham gives us the understanding of our strengths and bridges the gap of confidence needed when transferring your income earning position from one job you are already successful at to another you would rather be doing.  i recommend this book highly.
B00BWU0S3Q|5.0|I found this to be a very entertaining movie with an excellent cast. Good cops versus crooked cops and the mob. Not a dull moment!
B00C1XZ2LQ|3.0|Was expecting a Trent Reznor - atticus / daft punk level score that really can stand on its own.  It ended up being more a typical score that while not bad, didn't deliver the unique listening experience I was hoping for out of M83.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|this light is perfect for lots of applications, its not super bright but its plenty to do most jobs and it appears the light going to last for a while
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|we love this game. very entertaining and hard to put down.my 6yo loves it to. its a must have if you like video game type apps.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Saw this twice in the theater in 3d. Loved it. Doesn't follow the book precisely but it's a ton of fun. And now we have two copies so my husband can watch it in his studio on his normal dvd and we can watch it in blueray in the living room. Awesome!!
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|So glad to be able to stream early with Amazon Instant Video. I read this book, and while the movie is very different, as usual, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper were great in this film and even though it was very different than the book, it was still a really good movie.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I discovered my language and my husband's. Now we need to do the work of expressing it to one another.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is my first game of this type and if it's even remotely typical, I'm going to be buying a lot of these. It is superb fun.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son loves Legos, and I like how Bad Piggies gives him a chance to experiment with his engineering ideas in a safe environment.  Not to mention that he just thinks that he is playing and not actually learning something.
0812983459|3.0|The premise of the book (a man looking to find himself, at last) was interesting and brought me into the tale. Some very nice writing kept me going, but the middle of the book, when the various outside characters were introduced was strange. I had trouble believing that entire section, but kept on with the suspense of wanting to know what exactly Queenie had done for Harold. What wife Maureen had done, on the other hand, was entirely human and believable. I thought the ending, with Queenie incapacitated in such a grotesque manner, was overdone. However, all in all it was a good read.

B0011MZOEI|4.0|Completely ridiculous situations, totally unrealistic action, amazing explosions, just got to love it!  If you took the time to actually rent this, you'll enjoy it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I like having 'the enemy' clearly defined, ie: zombies! It makes one think - how would I react in that situation; what would I have done differently; would I have ended up as one of the brave overcomers, or as one of the unwilling dead? Stories like this certainly makes one think...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would recommend this to all seven year old horse lovers!  It teaches some basic skills and vocabulary for taking care of horses along with enriching math skills.
B004UJ81IA|5.0|You can't go wrong with RLS. I would suggest that anyone new to his writing read this before launching into Robinson Crusoe because it will tell you a lot about what sort of a fine fellow RLS himself was; it is the ideal introduction to hiw work.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I love this album.  Very hard and heavy music and super strong vocals. I didn't think I would Like the slower songs, but I think they are great as well
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This movie was just what my daughter wanted for Christmas.  It was in prefect condition and has been watched to the point of memorization.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|A great revival of some old favorites, beautifully arranged and sung. Gets your toes taping! After seeing Emmy on a talk show where she sang one of the album songs, I went to the computer and ordered SENIMENTAL JOURNEY!  fIRST cd i HAVE BOUGHT IN AGES.
B002HH9TUG|4.0|Some of the controls are actually too responsive is some games. The only major flaw is that it doesn't have decent configuration software for the PC.
B00BP3DPJY|3.0|a friend recommend i listen to 'song for zula'. which i like. then i went on to purchase it did not disappoint.
B004LWZW9M|5.0|I thought this was a great movie with a mix of emotions.  I enjoyed the journey watching this.  I thought each story unique but tying into each other.  The struggles of life, funny and sad.  Each character was struggling with the issues of their situation, some very serious others comedic.  But I really liked it, thanks!
B00947N6D8|5.0|i went to see this movie several times in theaters and am glad to own it now. despite the changes from the books it is still a wonderful story and one of my favorite movies.
0142418471|5.0|One of my favorite books ever.  Beautifully written, wonderful development, great wording.  An amazing story, this is truly a page turner, I highly recommend that you add this to your reading list.
B00B5JVXYC|5.0|I REALLY love this game! I have played the levels over and over and over again! Please, PLEASE, more like this one!!!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Many non-fiction WWII books are authored by historians or generals or admirals (and so often focus on strategies or timeline movement of forces or turning point events).  In comparison, this book was authored by a man who fought in the Pacific as a marine private.  It is a gritty description of life (and death) on the front lines.<br /><br />If you want to better know what war was like for the front-line troops in the Pacific in WWII, this is the book to read.  The book is not about glory of war; it is about the waste of war.  And it is about trying to survive, both physically and mentally, in a horrific environment over which you have essentially no control.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It is both well written and thoughtful.  (The author, after the war, earned a PhD and became a professor of biology.)<br /><br />The book most similar to this one (that I've read) is \\"To Hell and Back\\" by Audie Murphy.
0316044695|5.0|I have always supported our military and God bless our young men and women who have served our country.  This book gave me more of an insight into the world of Navy Seals and how tough and regimented their training is.  Many start the training but only a few make it.  Awesome that Marcus Luttrell shared his training and survival, against the odds and the loss of his three friends, in the mountains of Afghanistan by writing this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is really fun and strengthens the brain and you should really buy the app so they have something to do when you travel.
B000HIVOFU|5.0|The songs are good and recording quality is excellent. The singers can also express deep feeling in their performance as well.
B003B02PF4|3.0|As usual, I enjoyed the journey and the twists and turns of a John Grisham book. It held my interest. However, the ending left me hanging a little and hoping for a little more closure.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Krauss does an awesome job taking complex concepts (such as 'flat' vs 'curved' 3D space) and makes them more understandable. Excellent read. He's up there with Brian Greene in my book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am totally in love with this whole show its worth every penny ... just watching takes you away to another time and place
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|It is a great cd album of Bruno Mars that contains the songs that I like. His music a<br />great variety that is very entertaining and has great sounds.
B00007E8UG|4.0|The SACD is far better than my expectation because the recoding quality is very good plus I love the sons which makes me feel relaxed and comfortable after I listened to them after work. Recommend to buy
0385522401|5.0|Really liked how the author presented the story, thought provoking, easy reading but not simple.  Having been to Chesil Beach myself, was easy to picture what the author described.
B0087ZG7UW|4.0|My 12 year daughter wanted to see the orginal. so I order it. Wow it was delivered on time and very quickly. great packaging and prompt service;  Just like she thought not scary now but still a great movie for it time.  She is now a Hitchcock fan as I am..  Great addition to her growing collection of old scary movies. We both recommend it!
0763644765|4.0|I bought this for my daughter to help her to get interested in potty training. As soon as I got it out of the box she exclaimed, &#34;Potty!&#34; She loves to look at it and I do think it has worked to help her to be interested in her potty again.
B00AEBB8NI|2.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Shutter Island\\" staring Leonrdo DiCaprio Martin Scorsese directed the film. I found the film in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was just a coincidence, but a  couple nights  ago I also watched \\"GoodFellas,\\" also directed by Scorsese and a superb movie. The \\"Shutter Island\\" film started out rather well. Two federal investigators met as they were traveling by boat to a nearby island known as an imprisonment for the criminally insane. They were  to investigate the disappearance of a woman inmate. I followed the story for about an hour and it became more and more murky and harder and harder for me to understand. Finally, I lost it. From then on the story just made less  and less  sense.<br /><br />Now, if I was really interested, I'd go back and re-view he film. Sorry, I just didn't find it that interesting. The setting seemed  contrived and aimed at producing horor. It didn't work for me. The  characters in the movie seemed like mental hospital cliches. The acting of the main characters was quite good, but just couldn't carry the story as it badly drooped. It's a highly-thought-of  film and  some of the 3-, 4-, and 5-star reviews obviously have a better handle on it than I do. I'd suggest going over their reviews and seeing if they are of interest. For me, the story in the film was not overly interesting in the first place and became less and less interesting as the film ground down to the final credits. I'd regard it as a failed film, but certainly a lot of critics and reviewers would not agree with my opinion. See for yourself.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007DIQC90|5.0|I love this CD.  I can listen to it from front to back.  Why does my review require more words :(
0316044695|5.0|This was one of the most spiritually and emotionally impacting books I have ever read. It reveals the strength of Navy SEAL POW of taliban forces largely due to Washington's poor ROE dictations in military combat operations.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Great movie ,excellent cast.  Special killing effects WOW!  Typical Tarantino. you have to be fan to enjoy his style .  I got tired of the constant use of the n word but that's my only issue with it.  If you like violent westerns /  This is for you.  (reminds me of the wild Bunch)  I like  an recommend this movie.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed the journey that the author took me on in this book.  It was a roller coaster of emotions and life's discoveries of the self.  I was brought to tears through unspeakable atrocities at the orphanage and tears of laughter at Jaimies honesty.  It was a good read.
B0054SMID0|4.0|This was the first movie that I watched as an Amazon Prime member.  I enjoyed Matthew McConaughey - as usual - and though the plot was fairly predictable...it was a movie I would see again.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I understand that there are some added themes and scenes in this movie but do they hurt it overall...?  No.  Can't wait for the next two!
B000VWGYHU|5.0|This is one album that holds up through the years.  A classic from one of the best rappers in the game!
B007P7UF0G|5.0|Richard Harris at his best and of course the beautiful Vanessa Redgrave.  Is any man as handsome as the young Franco Nero? A great musical and a sad story. (betrayal. heart break)  A must see and own if you like great musical'.  I even went to see it on Broadway I like it so much
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My curiosity got the better of me and I bought the novel.  For the years women have struggled to gain equal societal and professional recognition, this novel is an insult.  It is my sincere hope young women who read this trilogy will aspire to loftier goals.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game for hand to eye ability and speed control.<br />Good for all ages.<br />Teach young children their colors and finger control.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|the movie was cute. I enjoyed to see a movie where someone works hard to get what they wanted. I absolutely loved the movie
B0084IG7KC|3.0|What made \\"The Hunger Games\\" not a good movie is the camera man.  Zooming in and out, camera is not stable, is this new ways of shooting?
1400031567|5.0|GOOD READ!<br /><br />Very good!  You will love it too!  All of us at our house did...Nice Swedish story!  A worthwhile choice!
B00BF123WG|2.0|Too much violence. Couldn't watch it. My husband said it was good 4 stars from him). Violence is not entertaining.
B006RXQ27O|5.0|I watched this with my 10 year old daughter and though many of the cartoon characters in this weren't familiar to her, she still enjoyed the humor and the story. A movie best suited for the 40+ crowd because of all the classic cartoon references from Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig etc. Not entirely 'family friendly' due to a few borderline off-color moments, but they'll either go over the kids heads or you might need to explain a few things. :-)
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|worth waching the history unfold in front of you. Great acting by the lead actor. I liked it. Watch it ASAP
1439153663|4.0|I just joined a book club for the first time and this was the first book we read. It was easy to read and hard to put down. The story was heart-wrenching. There are excellent questions in the back of the book for discussions.
B00BF11STU|5.0|It's awesome!! Pretty cool movie. You will like the movie. This flick is more believable than the previous navy seal movie.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Edge of your chair movie! My husband and I both enjoyed it-make sure you can watch with no distractions- it's that good!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Affleck should have been nominated for the Oscar! Tense, funny, and informative about that era geo-politics. Loved it! Alan Arkin has an excellent performance and steals the show.
B008220D5K|1.0|What a piece of s***,  this movie was so bad people should get their money back.  There was no redeeming....anything.  Leslie Mann is the most annoying woman on the planet (yes the same planet as Rosie O'Donnell).  Paul Rudd is just not funny as a \\"leading man\\" EVER    It made no sense, no one in the theater cared one way,  left after about 35 minutes.  I figure with drive time Apatow owes me one hour.  He can cut my grass, he should not be making movies.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This is one of Blake Shelton's greatest CD.  The music is wonderful and everyone of the songs tells a story
B000002N3N|5.0|There is no one like Enya, buy this album and everything else she has, she brings light, peace and happiness to life.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Our grand kids (ages 4, 6 and 8) loved it. My husband and I laughed right along with them- some great humor!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I cancelled the order - did not need it. I am still getting used to my new computer and may go back to ordering it if I am not satisfied with the one on there.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I love this band and I was so exited to by their album. I got the regular shipping which was about 5-8 business days. I got it two days after I ordered it! I am so happy that I ordered this!
B001QKSWOE|5.0|I enjoy all of these books and if i didnt i would delete them.. Which i dont i pass them on to all of friends.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|If you don't know Enya's music, then you must buy all of her albums. They are magical and wonderful and fill the air with blessings and graces. Thanks again to Amazon for the best prices on the web.
B005544V6A|5.0|My nephew in law school recommended this to me. My husband and I love it!! Great characters and actors! Every show was well worth watching - we look forward to watching the new season!
B000FA675C|4.0|I read this book before and purchased it because it was a free deal.  I did enjoy it and also read the sequel or prequel, Angels and Demons.  I don't, however, understand the reason for the feeding frenzy over this book when it first came out.  It was compelling, but I wouldn't consider it a &#34;must-read&#34;.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I love this game! I could play this game forever because it is so much better then the original Fruit Ninja. This is actually a game instead of just cutting up fruit. I love to challenge my brother to see who could get the most points!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was so much fun. It has everything one would look for in this type of game. I really had fun going through each scene without the stress of trying to remember where I need to go. The hint button was amazing when it came to directions because you don't have to wait for it to recharge before using it again. One of my favorite features ever was &quot;Miles&quot;the helpful monkey who was there to lend a hand when I couldn't reach a needed item. Also, the HO scenes were amazingly clear and interactive. The only downside I can find is the price tag. If you can spare about 5 bucks, then go for it because the graphics alone are a sight to see!
B0036TGT2A|5.0|This has to be one of the best Disney movies of all time! Plus, it will be in 3D October 1!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Ive been using yahoo mail for over 12 years now and I love it havent had a real problem with it
B000FBJAOG|3.0|This book is a bit long, but it does have some relevant info related to general survival preparation.  Zombie = Federal Agents.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|An awesome book, but the end is different than most of Rick's other books. It's kinda sad. I can't wait until The House Of Hades is published!!!!! SO EXCITED!!!! Annabeth is SO clever!!! I love her!!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|After several attempts they still did not stick to the wall, problem seems to be not enough glue. The refunded me my money , except I had to pay to send it back. Cost me $18.00 to learn a lesson.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Watched about 10 minutes and turned it off - filthy language is NOT necessary or appealing. It would be nice if we had some script writers who knew how to express strong emotion without 4-letter words every other sentence.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but it certainly wasn't the philosophical bent that was presented.  I loved the views on religion and at the end Pi's &#34;which story do you prefer?&#34; just said everything that needed to be said.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen this year good from begging till the very end highly recommend this to everyone!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing! It's very addicting once you start playing it. I highly recommend this game for anyone that has younger children.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|We watched this movie with my 10 year old and her friend.  We all thought it was great -- it provoked a lot of discussion about the ending, surfing, oceans, loss, working hard for something.  It is based on a true story which made it more poignant.  Lovely scenery and atmosphere; nice character development.
B0072X2O66|3.0|The album is not bad but the riffs are a little generic for me, but taking that aside the album is really heavy, the mix is good, the vocals are great and it really pumps you up. Good album, not great.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|The singing was sometimes sacrificed for the sake of the acting (for example, Fontine was sobbing so at the end of her song that it took away from the power of the song).  However, having seen two movies and the 10th and 25th anniversary concerts, I think this was a credible attempt to tell the story (in fact, it was the most complete version), as well as a good attempt at presenting the music.  However, for me, Philip Quast was the  best Javert.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I began reading this book once a year since 6th grade. Well, I am 40 now and have kept up the tradition. Needless to say, the movie did not disappoint. A must for all Tolkien fans.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway surfer is a great game. Not an amazing game but great. I noticed some play-off of the Temple Run ® apps like adding keys similar to the gem effect in the game. I do enjoy the graphics and content.I miss the original not the world tour. Sydney is a great location and well detailed but I hoped to see the original sometime soon. This is a good game, but not my favorite
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I choose this rating because the book was very interesting. My favorite part was when Katniss teamed up with Rue. This book was very interesting.
1595828753|5.0|I'm a huge Avatar fan and this story is the follow up to the TV series. It has been great reading more about this characters and knowing that their story keeps getting better and keeps having that unique factor that made the Avatar series a great one.
B009AMANBA|2.0|Sound of the music drowned out the words of Lincoln.  I really was very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it..
B005LAIIJY|2.0|Shooting, blood, lots of N words, stupid white people, ridiculous premise..that's it. The second part is especially slow and boring. The finale is like a comic book.
B0059XTTW8|2.0|Gary Oldman absolutely shines as George Smiley, a great character by best-selling author, John le Carre'.<br /><br />But the movie jumps around like a kangaroo on a trampoline in an earthquake.<br /><br />Flashbacks are so poorly crafted, you're confused if we're in the present or past.<br /><br />Editing (and/or screenwriting) leaves out HUGE chunks of information about the 4 potential double agents, so you have no attachment or feelings for these key characters.<br /><br />Reading the book is a much, much RICHER experience and that's a huge indictment of the lack of skill in producing a movie that should make characters and plot twists come alive.<br /><br />Totally trashed a superb story.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I thought this book was well-written and, although I am a 65-year-old woman who has never had to work outside the home, it spoke to me. I think every woman should read this book and I have recommended it to all my friends.
1401235417|5.0|... of awesomenes because this story is GREAT!!! Snyder is a great writer and Capullo's art keeps getting better in every issue.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This is one of those games that when you look at it ya don't want it but when you play it you love it
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love this series and continue to watch the first season! Very entertaining and lots of excitement and gore! Even my wife likes it!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I've been reading for the better part of seven decades, and have to say that books like this are rare finds. The price makes it even better, but I have paid much more for far less entertainment. Thank you, Andy, for crafting this stirring story of a &#34;Robinson Crusoe on Mars&#34;. Inventive, detailed, but more than that, nail-biting in the most enjoyable way. Great characters, excellent pacing, and well-written with regard to spelling, grammar and style. I also will be looking forward to future efforts!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would like listening to a complete album of music by Bruno Mars but surprisingly loved this one.
1476734941|4.0|I'm re-reading the book - slowly. I'm also following the authors' basic premise. I am fasting (500 calories) two days a week. So far so good. There are some hunger pangs on fasting days, but nothing that can't be managed and I find I can fill my stomach in a satisfying way and still keep to 500 calories. Give me some time (a few more weeks or months) and I'll see if I reap some of the promised benefits.<br /><br />Did not fall in love with the recipes in the book.
B008FPOIT6|1.0|It was not what I thought it would be. Glad I didn't download it when it was first released. If u have some extra time and are into wizardry and weird puzzles....this book is for you.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|Thought there'd be more about the Biden laden house. It's a decent movie but not worth $25. Should've waited to buy it!
B0098460O4|5.0|I found the original singers on youtube.  Once I found the album CD, I purchased it immeditely  !!!  *P*E*R*F*E*C*T*  !!!  Great Merchandise !!!
B000FA675C|5.0|This book had me from the very first page.  Loved every moment of the book.  It also brought to my attention politics in religion.  For some reason never really put the two together.  Recently purchased the book for my Kindle, thinking of reading it again.  I think it is one of those books you can read several times and still catch something new you missed before.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Love this movie! Its perfect for preschoolers! My daughter asks to watch it everyday. She knows all the words to the songs and sings along!  I would recommend it for any girl 3 and up!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is amazing. I feel in love with the first one so I had to read the second and third. I've never been so interested in reading books until these ones.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I do not consider my self a prude but the language gets shocking.  The bizzare story could have been good but just did not follow true for me.  I managed to finish it because my book club was reading it, but if I were reading it on my own I would not have finished the book.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|i tried this game but once you beat it the game is done. maybe some people don't have money to buy it. therefore, it is fun but it should be free.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Is a clasic packman but the control relly sucks, it could be better with a motion control, anything else its a good old game to play
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I so enjoy keeping in touch with people I have lived closer to in the past and see how life is treating them.  I send messages back and forth to my next door neighbors too without interrupting their daily task.<br /><br />Watch only the news I choose as important
B0027VTMAE|5.0|One of the last great films of Polanski. Ideal to have on blu ray with high quality picture and sound. Highly recommended.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool Omnibus Edition is a quick read with a fascinating story line. Any sci-fi fan familiar with apocolyptic/futuristic storylines will enjoy the story as it unfolds. With multiple well developed characters who take unexpected twists, this story holds your attention throughout. The Omnibus Edition allows you to move quickly though the different books without having to wait for the next edition. After finishing episodes 1-5, I quickly downloaded and read episodes 6-8 plus some interesting fanfiction. Now I'm at a dead stop waiting for Hugh Howey to write the next set of episodes entitled Dust. Hurry up Hugh!!!!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Hard to navigate at times, sometimes not quite sure where all trucks are going. It is interesting going to keep playing to see what happens next.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this gems are spossed to be played by coims- not real money. this is how you get 5 stars to everyone
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is classic Downton Abbey.  A great watch.  Very well done.  I recommend highly.  A must have for the library.
0525478817|3.0|I bought this book when I was on vacation and have read it 2.5 times since then. Every time I read it I like it less and less, to the point that I couldn't finish it the last time.<br /><br />To preface, I've watched John + Hank's videos for over a year and I really wanted to like this book. I haven't liked any of John's books since LfA, but I'd heard such great reviews that I thought this would be better.<br /><br />I think this book played on all of the faults in John's writing and this is why I disliked it. To start off, the entire tone of the book, from the narration to dialogue, came off extremely pretentious, to the point of tedium. By my third read-through I was reading several bits of the books in John's voice, because he talks exactly how he writes. Granted, Green is a 35 (?) year old man with an English major, who is very articulate and has an extensive vocabulary. he should have toned it down when writing about two awkward, teenage virgins talking to each other. I think Hazel and Augustus were both guilty of sounding like they were talking like mature, well-read adults. I also found the constant references to other literature inside the book annoying to the point of distraction, especially since it was narrated by a 17 year old girl. Between Fitzgerald, Vonnegut, Shakspeare, the poetry within the book, and the excerpts from \\"An Imperial Affliction\\" I felt like it really diluted the believability of the book.<br />All of the really obvious metaphors rally detracted from the plot. The most obvious ones the come to mind were the unlit cigarette, the bones sculpture in the park, the \\"ghettoization of breakfast foods\\", and how An Imperial Affliction doesn't have an ending. However, Green has separately stated that there are other metaphors hidden within the book, such as:<br />-Hazel's name: Hazel is an \\"in-between color,\\" just as Hazel herself was \\"in-between\\" sickness and health.<br />-Amsterdam: a city both dependent on water and drowning it in<br />-When they are on the plane and Augustus' movie ends before Hazel's, it is foreshadowing for his death, which is before hers.<br />I'm sure there are others I'm forgetting, but these are the few that come to mind.<br />The choice of a girl narrator was also really distracting. I am roughly the same age as Hazel, and I felt like I couldn't relate to her at all. Obviously, I don't have cancer, but I felt like parts of her narration was really forced. Green's forte is a male voice, but I think he decided to narrate from a girl's point of view to break the pattern of his other books.<br />Finally, I didn't really find the plot all that intriguing. Van Houten was not a very believable character. (How ironic that his characters are obsessed with finding closure to a novel, when Green himself is famous for ending his book without closure.)<br />This is still a pretty good book, especially considering it's a YA book. I did cry the first few times I read it (in fact, I practically bawled). I wouldn't recommend this book to friends, and my favorite Green novel is still the debut, Looking for Alaska.<br />I would love to see John write a novel about older people, even in their twenties. I think he is a good writer, but I've never been able to find any of his character very likeable or believable. John said somewhere that he is under contract to write 4 more books, which is good, because I don't think he's really found his voice as a writer yet.
B0093H8HXS|4.0|This would get five stars if the fan weren't so loud. I don't think it's broken just a cheap fan. I would expect more from Intel. I also think Intel is simply overpriced for all the ivy bridge products. I'll just get a different CPU fan but really I shouldn't have to.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|A lot of fun, especially if you like Super Mario Bros. The touch screen does create some bugs, vs a controller, but as a free game, I'm pleased!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really enjoyed the story. Very creative, attention grabbing, well organized. HATED the ending! Like an unresolved argument, it is hard to put the book down and say it's finished. No satisfaction. No justice, no consequence. Like the author ran out of ideas. Very frustrating.
B001EJIMUG|5.0|This is a great movie! It stays true to the book and any Austen fan will love it. As to people outside the Austen fandom, I cannot speak for them because I love Jane Austen and the well made movies!
B001DJLD1M|5.0|I love not having to buy 3 separate films to have the trilogy I like have all three in one set. So if you are like me and don't want to take up too much shelf space this is a great deal.
B000XPOB0M|5.0|Biblical plagues combine with suspense to keep you guessing.  All the tension without a lot of gore- my favorite kind of horror movie:)
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I followed her on YouTube, and this was my most anticipated album. I love especially the dubstep tracks. Thank you.
B006YM9JSW|2.0|No mention in the product discription that there was no fan or heat sink with this product.For this price it should have came<br />with it..Not happy..
0525953728|5.0|A captivating read from beginning to end, especially for someone who has been in the military or interested in military history.
B0006SNK9E|5.0|I had orig. bought this album on an 8 Track Tape in January of 1976.  Then LATER that year, I bought the IMPORT record of Sweet Fanny Adams.  Just recently, on April 6, 2013, I ordered THIS album on a 2005 deluxe CD with 6 BONUS TRACKS.  It was so great to hear this album again, after so many years.  I would like to offer my review of SOME of THESE songs. SIX of these tunes have also appeared on the 1975 U.S. Album of \\"Desolation Blvd.\\" that was issued on CAPITOL RECORDS. So here is my opinion of SOME of the songs, from THIS album that I HAVEN'T reviewed yet, as follows:<br /><br />2. \\"Heartbreak Today\\"...This song is EXCELLENT in every way possible. I love EVERYTHING about this tune.<br /><br />4. \\"Rebel Rouser\\"...This is also great song, which I love very much. It seems quite SIMILAR to \\"Hell Raiser\\"<br /><br />5. \\"Peppermint Twist\\"...Sweet does a FANTASTIC 1974 remake of the old 1961-1962 classic, orig. written & performed by Joey Dee & The Starlighters.  Sweet's remake of \\"Peppermint Twist\\" seems SO ALIVE, even TODAY & it's too bad that it NEVER charted in America. It really should have charted HERE though, because it's an EXCELLENT rendition, in my opinion.<br /><br />7. \\"Restless\\"...This song was on the flip side of \\"Ballroom Blitz\\", when it was issued by Capitol Records.  I love this song, very much.  On the CHORUS PART, of \\"Restless\\", it sounds weird & yet it's haunting. I, myself, also call this song \\"Too Late Now\\" as it's mentioned quite often, when it's sung. This song also seems a little humorous @ times.<br /><br />10. \\"Blockbuster\\"...I remember this song from their BELL Records collections. PARTS of THIS song sound just like 1988's \\"Doctor Who\\" theme.<br /><br />11. \\"Need A Lot Of Lovin\\"...Another good song from their Bell Records compilations.<br /><br />12. \\"Hell Raiser\\"...This song reminds me a lot of \\"Rebel Rouser\\".  I love this crazy song & it  has also appeared on Bell Records compilations.<br /><br />13. \\"Burning\\"...This song was the flip side to \\"Hell Raiser\\". I haven't heard this song before, up until NOW. It is pretty good & in certain parts, it does remind me SOMEWHAT of \\"Immigrant Song\\" by Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />15. \\"Rock & Roll Disgrace\\"...This song is also NEW to me...it's wasn't familiar & all.  I love this tune & I think it's very good.  I'm really NOT sure why the word DISGRACE is part of the title, though. I do hear them sing \\"Rock & Roll Queen\\" or STAR more often.<br /><br />It seems as though the 1974-1975 time frame was MY favorite time for Sweet's music. The \\"Sweet Fanny Adams\\" & \\"Desolation Blvd.\\" albums are my TOP favorites.  The \\"SWEET FANNY ADAMS\\" album, that features the 6 BONUS TRACKS is highly recommended. I've had the album 2 times, before I bought my 2005 CD...It's just that Good.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I purchased the digital series and watched it with ease on my Playsation 3. Great way to get caught up on the action.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it could have. a few more activitys but all around good game for all ages . also game has good graphics.
B0000844I8|5.0|Wide screen format.  Large horizontal bars obstructive & noticeable.  The theater release is 119 minutes. This version around 210 minutes.  The director comment version, 119 minutes, contains much of what didn't make it to out to the theaters.  I had no idea this was such a large scale production done in Yuma, AZ.  Sound track is the real star of this dvd.  I think there were several menu  choices i.e. 2.0 & 5.0, and so forth for the best sound sound possible.  No English caption.  Most of us have seen it run on TV too many times But the extra ten minutes & high end sound track made it worth the time to see agin.
1594746168|4.0|Horror fans are always clamoring for something different.<br /><br />\\"Vampires (Werewolves/Zombies/Demons/etc.) again?? Where's the originality? Give me something new!\\"<br /><br /> Well, put your money where your collective mouths are, Horror fans. Here's something new.<br /><br /> While not overtly horrific, E.B. Hudspeth's The Resurrectionist: The Lost Work of Dr. Spencer Black created and managed to maintain a distinct air of unease and dread, almost from page one. I read a lot, and I read a lot of Horror, and I have to tell you, it's not often that I get that delicious feeling of chills crawling up the back of my neck. Hudspeth delivered that feeling, and delivered in spades.<br /><br /> The book is presented in two parts: The first part is a fictional biography of Dr. Spencer Black, a renowned Surgeon whose life takes a turn for the strange in the late 1800's. Black becomes obsessed with the notion of mythological creatures, specifically with the idea that beings such as Centaurs, Dragons, Harpies, and others, did exist...He not only posits their existence, but suggests that they were offshoots of Humanity, and the secrets to their return could be locked within the Human body, waiting to be coaxed out by the right man...<br /><br /> Black shuns the Medical world, and begins to work in secret....work which eventually leads him to a traveling sideshow, where he creates his own bizarre, chilling exhibits.<br /><br /> The second portion of the book is comprised of \\"The Codex Extinct Animalia\\", which features a long-lost book that Black had published toward the end of his life, which catalogs his thoughts, complete with his extensive, painstaking illustrations, on a host of mythological (Or were they real....?) beasts.<br /><br /> I was expecting a jumped-up high-concept book that would be heavy on art (Which it is...), but I was really taken aback by Hudspeth's writing ability. He presents the first half of the book as a straightforward, if somewhat bizarre, biography, and never wavers from that format. It's what happens between the lines, what he implies, that carries the full weight of the Horror that Black's life is becoming, and Hudspeth does a phenomenal job of making the reader aware of his intent without bludgeoning his points home. I can think of few, if any, seasoned Horror Authors that could have done a better job. His artistic renderings of Black's creatures is nothing short of breathtaking...You almost feel as if Hudspeth had them on a table, in various states of dissection, while he created the sketches.<br /><br /> The Resurrectionist: The Lost Work of Dr. Spencer Black is a rare treat for horror fans, and I can't recommend it enough.<br /><br /> Quirk Books provided a review copy.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Enjoyed this a lot, and thought it had the right balance between personal story and technobabble.  Probably won't be a sequel, tho...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I can't get over how much I loved these books. The story line, along with the sex, was fantastic. Sad that it's all over though.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|It kept my interest right to the end, but I didn't like the ending. I looked for a happier ending.
B002KS1IJC|1.0|Yes, a movie can be so bad it's good and this one is. It's so silly you don't need Mystery Science Theatre. You can do the jokes yourself! Hurrah for Harvey Wienerstein and all the schlockmeisters in Hollywood! This is one of their greatest!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this product. It is so soothing for either sleeping or meditation and so convenient. I can relax on the ride to work or while I am starting to fall asleep. I recommend this for anyone.
B00863CMZE|5.0|Who would have thought that a hard rock guitarist could write and produce such great music???<br /><br />I can't remember how I got onto the duo of Blackmore/Night but it was one of the better things that happened to me over the years.<br /><br />If you are a Medieval music lover, or even if you aren't, give Blackmore's Night a try....
B000002UZ4|4.0|Pet Shop Boys are one of those groups where you know their songs, but not them, like &#34;West End Girls&#34;. All of these songs have a unique rock/dance tempo and fun to listen to.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My two year old loves this! It doesn't get old for her and we share lots of laughs over it. It does just what is described. She loves knocking the cat down. It is helping her learn to talk as well!
B005LAIISA|5.0|again a very well made antimated movie it wasa funy and also had a nice story  line ti it. i give it a yes
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm hooked on the show, missed the weekly PBS episodes, so found them here for a very reasonable download price.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|this stuff works great. i used it to fix up my ps3 ylod and it worked great. i would recommend it
B00B3HJMLM|2.0|Very disappointed in this album. Not country enough. And it's just a re-release of previous songs. Glad I used points to purchase this and didn't actually spend money on it!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Diamond Dash is a fun little game.  However I take issue with how quickly the game tears through your free lives.  It really is a bit frustrating.  The game is free though, so I can't really complain much.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I don't get this app.  Some of my books show up & some don't.  Of course, the book I really wanted to read on my Android Tablet wasn't in the list of books that I could read.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|The game draws you in and is super fun and make you want to get better cards and items. Has a great Pace and a good reward system will keep you playing for hours wish it had an offline play feature so I could play when I travel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because i see a resemblance to the game temple run and in my opinion that is one of the best games there are so to me this game deserves to be rated with five star and thats what im going to do.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love the game but it is harder to get items since updates and its expensive to buy credits!  They have made the game much harder to win and trading on Facebook is a must now!!!!!
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I am a frequent user of timers at work.  I have yet to find the perfect timer for my needs.  I am considering learning programming just to make it.  That said this comes close.<br /><br />Pros<br />-multiple saved times, easily accessible<br />-easily switched to stopwatch<br />-easy to program and save new timers<br />-nicely configurable<br /><br />cons<br />-I can not figure out how to turn off the voice announcement of the length of time<br />-to start each timer you have to click on the timer, then find the teeny tiny start button, which is in the edit screen<br />-when it is done it goes back to the main screen with all of the timers, so you have to go through this process repeatedly if you are using the same timer over and over<br /><br />Recommendations<br />-A larger separate start button for the timers, or start them from the main screen<br />-There is a nice screen when the timer is done.  This should be the screen that shows up when you touch a timer, there should be a LARGE start button, and smaller pause reset buttons.<br />-I like to configure colors and stuff, but that isn't really important<br />-An option (or more obvious option) to get rid of the voice announcement.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, which I watched as part of a class assignment for a graduate level course on autism spectrum disorders. The portrayal of the characteristics of a person with autism is done very well, it is pretty accurate. It is also a very entertaining movie with a great story which will keep you interested until the very end. It is funny, sad, upsetting, comforting, and just great all around!
B008M7BQHE|5.0|Well written! Great characters! I'm a sucker for a good sci-fi show and this has been such a great late discovery for me. I can't wait to finish the next season.
B00005N6KG|4.0|These are good headphones, but I have a gripe with them, so not great.  I don't use earbuds because they always fall out of my hear eventually.  Apple earbuds stay in my ear, but they die within weeks due to sweat.  These sony headphones are a great design, however they're far too light and flexible!  I have an average sized head, but the headphones need to be stiffer and tighter, and not so flexible.  The earbuds don't push into your heads well enough, so you don't get quality sounds, and they move around a little.  They're still better than so many other headphones I've used to run, but they're not perfect.  I used to have an older version, the sony sport over the head earphones that were yellow.  I liked those better.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|The Eagles Farewell Live from Melbourne is a great disc. Sharp image, excellent sound and they play all your favorites and more. Sure the boys are looking older (Glen Frey looks like he's getting an old mans hunch at the start of the disc) but then who isn't - The Stones, Aerosmith, Kenny Rogers! But the music is just the same and they seem to be having fun on stage. Well worth purchasing! Highly recommend.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|The Master [HD] - seriously hated this movie. Acting was excellent but its theme was very ugly, in my personal opinion.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This movie was a great movie to watch and a very clean movie. If you like Captain America you will like the knowledge you get from his background. Great movie.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great graphics and a really nice game if you enjoy racing. Try it once and you will be hooked on it.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Not having seen this on TV a friend thought I may like it. He was right. Sure the first episode grabs you and the next few are really about character development but after episode five or six things start to take off. It's a bit like the Twilight Zone in that each episode is unique, locations are different and most of the characters change with the exception of the three leads. Well worth a look and I am enjoying it.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|Les Miserables (2012) [HD] -- outstanding film. I saw it at the theater -- and couldn't wait to purchase it along with a few of the other 2012 films that were so amazing like Argo and Lincoln.
B003Y5D776|5.0|I am using this as an audio input device for my Raspberry Pi setup.  Took no time at all to get going and works quite well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was a little put off at first but I read all three books on a week and could not put them down.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|I have always loved this musical and the score and plot are great. Ever since seeing a live version I have come to appreciate this movie even more. The only negative for this blu-ray edition is that the picture quality isn't as sharp or as good as I would have hoped. It is extremely watchable but does not leap out at you on the Hi-def TV. Of course it was filmed in 1972 but I have seen older films transferred to blu-ray and they are as sharp as ones made today. So, slightly disappointed at the picture quality but the music/lyrics are good and it is worth buying.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|I searched for 3 songs when I first downloaded this app and not one of them was available. WHAT IS THE POINT of offering music service if your selection sucks! A complete waste of my time and whoever reads this don't waste your time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Went on vacation and needed a good time-filler for flights, etc.  This fit the bill, read all three books wither on my cellphone or the Kindle.
0694003611|5.0|Kids loved it from the start and still love to read it all the time!! Great to give as a gift also.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|An excellent bit of research but I found a few historical flaws.<br />I appreciate Doris Kearns writing style very much.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game! It's perfect for my kindle fire HD!  If you love Myst this is your game!  The objective is to open a large box by solving various puzzles on the side panels and on top.  There's no need to write things down and you're not walking vast distances to complete puzzles.  It's challenging enough to keep you guessing, but it has a clue button when you're at your wits end.  I eagerly look forward to the next chapter.  This game was totally worth the low price!
B0084AXZK0|3.0|Something I felt I needed to read based on clasic literature references, just haven't been able to get started with it.  A little hard to relate to the author based on his nonconventional history.
1452110581|3.0|A unique view, as if a person could possibly imagine what a cat thinks!!!  But it doesn't take long to read and would make a nice 'fun gift' for a cat lover!
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|Some of the games don't explain how to play clearly.  I prefer playing a different mind game app.  I guess buying only free or cheap apps doesn't always pay.
1419707671|5.0|Kids loved it. They are excited and are asking for the other Diary of a Wimpy kid books.<br /><br />Thank you.
B004Q3RDVG|5.0|This was a great summer break read.  Couldn't put it down.  Ignored the kids.  Truly enjoyed it.  I wish there was more to digest.
B0010SKTRA|5.0|This book was full of fascinating information. It was pieced together in a way that was easy to follow, and connected and built upon ideas throughout. The science is spot on and the anecdotes help give the story a bit of human interest
B005D9MUWY|4.0|It has been the keyboard I use. I love the predictions, and how it learns. The swiping feature works good. I like how you can start mid word. It is slow sometimes.
1419707663|5.0|Kids loved it. They are excited and are asking for the other Diary of a Wimpy kid books.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00AG473GE|2.0|It is OK. It brought back memories when I was growing up. Somethings still remain the same. Everyone is judged by the society they hang out with.
B008RTE066|3.0|The main reason I purchased this was due to the vinyl EP reissue. I already had the DVD. The sale price was good, but one of the vinyl EPs had a small area of paper loss on one side (presumed to be a factory defect). I considered returning it, but it was not worth the hassle. Overall, this is a nice repackaging of the originals.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|My mom has severe dementia, so this book was extremely interesting to me. It provides a lot of insight to what goes on in the thoughts and emotions victims of this disease experience.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Hard to have anything less, given the actors.  I've watched this on several occasions and have not tired of it; instead I discover nuances with each viewing that draw me in even farther.  For me, being of the same age as these actors, it is gratifying to see older people depicted as having full and complex personal lives, every bit as vital as any teenager.  Judi Dench is, as always, splendid but every actor in this film is top notch...it's lovely.
B00006JI11|1.0|I did not realize this was for a foreign DVD. The next one bought I thought it would run on my DVD but it did not either. I was very disappointed.
B006PTL1QM|2.0|I could not even finish the movie and I am not surprised when a friend told me later that the book is a real snoozer too. Time and again, good actors cannot make up for a dog of a script, the basis of a movie that is mind numbingly slow.
B000GWE44U|4.0|Jack Torance (Jack Nicholson), ex-school teacher, fancies himself a budding writer, and thinks he's found the perfect job to bring his fermenting ideas to fruition. He gets a gig as off-season caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, an isolated ski resort that is open from May to October, until the roads that lead to it get snowed over. That means that Jack will have 6 months to write a book, play, or whatever else he wants to do. He's also bringing his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and his psychic son, Danny (Danny Lloyd). Danny has been told by his imaginary friend (actually a manifestation of his psychic powers) , that bad things are gonna go down at the Overlook. Apparently, the hotel has a strong paranormal aura that Danny's arrival will only cause to be amplified. It's something that's never brought up in the film. Danny's powers, his \\"shine\\", is what causes everything to happen. Probably a normal kid would not have caused as much reaction by the hotel. In the opening scenes of Jack's interview, we learn about one of the previous caretakers that killed his wife and twin girls with an axe ten years previously. When Danny gets to the hotel he just happens to see two creepy twin girls when he's playing darts. Jack is also a recovering drinker who once dislocated Danny's arm while he was drunk. So, haunted hotel, psychic kid whose powers amplify the haunting, alcoholic dad with frustrating writers block...um, it's not going to be pretty.<br /><br /> The main problem this movie has is that Jack (that's Jack AND Jack Nicholson) can't really descend into madness because he ALREADY seems half crazy at the beginning of the movie. Or just WEIRD. Any normal person would look at Jack and KNOW he's not someone you would want to get snowbound with for 6 months. Wendy as played by Shelley Duvall doesn't seem to be playing with a full deck either. Danny seems to be the most qualified by default to deal with the horror of the Overlook Hotel. On Wikipedia, it says that Robin Williamsof all people was considered for the role of Jack, but Nicholson does a pretty good job of channeling him. His performance also reminded me a lot of Jim Carrey, or actually Nicholson's own turn as the Joker. Actually, the Joker seemed a bit more sane and less strange than Jack in The Shining.<br /><br /> Nicholson does a lot better portraying insanity when he's not talking and Kubrick is able to just focus on his body language and expressions. Overall, the acting seemed very operatic or even silent movie era. Everything is taken to such an extreme, which is not a trademark for Kubrick. It's almost as if the MOVIE is suffering from hysteria, not the actors.<br /><br /> Which brings me to another point. The real menace of The Shining is the ambience, the atmosphere of the hotel. I've always found something creepy about empty places meant to be filled with people. Just the fact that you have this huge hotel being perfectly still gives me chill bumps. And the way Kubrick perfectly frames the rooms and uses disquieting color schemes just adds to the effect. It's a shame that Kubrick's movie only really inspires horror when it's quiet. When it's not goading its actors into almost comical expressions of fear and lunacy.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching this movie again since I hadn't seen it in ages. My real purpose was to get myself ready to watch Room 237, the documentary about all the weird symbolism and theories about the true meaning of this film.<br /><br />Also definitely check out the novel by Stephen King, which is even better than the movie!
B006MW3V6U|1.0|One of the best series on television I have ever seen. BBC is unrivaled in excellence. The characters become so well known that you find yourself caring about their outcomes whether good or bad.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|Best way for me to provide feedback on products, prototypes, etc.  Have used Skitch on iPhone, iPad, and desktop.  Sync'd to Evernote.  Total blessing.  Easy to use as well.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|great shipping and came in as described season is good and i recommend to others who like the show would buy again if i had the need to do so great show
B005T87QCI|1.0|just don't buy this. all you do is mash a bunch of buttons and you can only get other robots by buying them with money.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a big calculator so it doesn't even require me to use my glasses.  It functions well and does the typical calculations.
B008602KQI|4.0|Overall, the movie was great, I really would have liked to see some kind of twist at the end so it wasn't so predictable.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I read everything that he writes, especially Harry Bosch novels.  Always well done, engrossing, good reads and I am disappointed I only have one left to read. It will be like losing an old friend .  I like the Lincoln lawyer books as well and others he has written.
B00AAW1322|5.0|I love this app! it is easy to use and fun. maybe add The Bear Necessities and some Green Day or The Killers songs too.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It would not work at all so I uninstalled it.  Too much for my poor KIndle Fire. Otherwise, it might be fun.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|As usual, the story was good, but, it seemed, with a cast of thousands. Way too many people; and as sometimes happens, too much tedious detail. Tempe is like a female Quincy, getting into harm's way at every turn. I'll keep reading Kathy's books, though. The science behind her work is interesting.
B0086700CM|5.0|It gets faster and faster! I'm having a blast playing! If only my tablet was lighter I could play longer!
0553801473|5.0|This is a great book to sink your eyes and mind into. Really good &#34;trilogy of 5&#34; LOL Can wait to read the next
B009KEN87O|2.0|I thought it might be too 'young' for me and my reflexes but even my daughter doesn't like it.  It requires speed and prior knowledge of similar games.
B008602KQI|3.0|The premise of the movie was interesting, but through out the movie and the out come was very predictable. Glad I did not go to the show.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I play this on a Kindle Fire HD. I haven't had many glitches although I do get higher scores when I play on the IPod. Overall a nice little stress reliever and its fun to play against friends.
B003VVAE4W|5.0|Smart, witty, well written.  Perfectly cast...every character adds to the show and makes you care about them. Love the father/daughter relationship.  An excellent series.
1567184855|5.0|I give this book a 5 star rating and I think it boils down that it can make anybody feel comfortable knowing that there are group souls looking over us and we have soul families. This is a great book and it is a great way to know what is waiting for us on the other side.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is great for my 7 year old. She loves horses and the graphics are incredible. I would recomend to any kid that loves horses.
1568363850|4.0|As there are two version of this book, the romanized version and the kana version it would have been better if both books had been combined where the first 10 chapters were romanized and the second ten/part of the book was kana. That would have saved some money. Unfortunately this is not the case so you have to purchase both books where the kana version is really for the second part (once you've mastered the Hiragana character set).<br />Other than that good book.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Great way to pass time when you're looking for something mindless to do.<br /> I refuse to purchase any coins though!
B00BU18U82|1.0|Poor controls and difficult directions lose all the fun value it might have had. Waste of time and money. Don't buy!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a wonderful game for my 7 year old she loves it. I love it too. We are almost up to the Tiger shark!!!
B001BZRUR4|5.0|My second time reading this book, first on kindle, I found myself as engaged as ever. This book is a must read for anyone willing to think deeper than the story.
B0053O89XI|5.0|We love the Big Bang Theory seasons!  Best mini-date night show for my husband and I! Funny and clever. Wonderful
1476733953|4.0|I picked this up to see what made it a globally viral, digital-book phenom. It kept me reading for two days straight. Recommended if you enjoy post-apocalyptic, what's-going-to-happen-next? sci-fi tales and don't mind not being able to put a book down..
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I never plan a trip without using Trip Advisory.  We depend on the reviews to find good hotels and meals.  From Mississippi to Wilmington Delaware I have never been disappointed.  Kept us out of s popular hotel chain and into a wonderful local hotel la's year.  Wilmington DE is a different kind of area to navigate.  Found a great restaurant and will visit again the year.  Great info and honest reviews.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|I've only used it once or twice to check it out. The color choices are limited and honestly, I can't figure out how to do more than doddle with it yet. If there is a way to get colors to blend for shading, it's hidden. I think it would be great for a mom with kids to keep them busy while at a doctor's office or something but for real creative art? - Not.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book changed how I feel about running.  It was transformative.  So glad I read it.  I recommend this book to family and friends almost weekly.  Fantastic.
B002OSY2T6|4.0|My 4 month old nephew really likes the mirror on this snail.  He loves mirrors, so this keeps his interest.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|It's a fantastic album, which shipped and got here on time and it was perfect.<br /><br />The actual envelope was a bit torn by the time it got to me, which was a bit scary but everything was fine.<br /><br />Thanks so much!
B005SQ3AI0|4.0|Really top quality sound & pick of albums!!  Of course, she was an incredible talent & these CD's prove that point!!  I only shrugged while listening to the selection of duets that were included.  I wanted more of just plain Dinah!!!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie during our most recent date night movie rental on Amazon.com. Kept us both interested and entertained.
B00BESM14U|3.0|Everyone raved about this movie, but I didn't connect with it. Some of it felt kind of empty to me. There were funny parts and I cried in it, but it wasn't a movie I fell in love with.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This was an unlikely choice for me to read, being more inclined towards crime and thrillers, but I was well rewarded by doing so. The writing style was simple and unobtrusive; the pacing and development finely tuned. Characters were developed as required and recognizable. A modern Pilgrim's Progress that will resonate with many thoughtful people from teenage years to the mature. Rachel Joyce has written an excellent novel that sidesteps cliche whilst examining a path that so many of us have shared.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun but yet addictive I love this game so much I cant put it down. Must have it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This app allows a cheap way to hone your skills. It is very addictive, but not to the point of outrageous. Wait a while and more coins appear without spending anything.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did. I've seen the other two movies and they're good for what they are. But this movie was surprisingly emotional. I didn't expect to cry. It was heartfelt. I think people that enjoyed the first two movies would enjoy it and be surprised by it.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book will stir your soul to action.  Seeing the realities of North Korea has led me to work towards freeing these people from their prisons.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is so fun.It's easy to get new sharks at first they are locked but after you get the shark full grown the next shark is unlocked and it costs money not real money fake money
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|first it's a great album... the extra tracks are good<br />second it comes with a essay about the band which is very well writen<br />third the live album is great<br />finally the dvd is fantastic great video quality on most of it<br /><br />however i wish  they had had a vinyl option
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie is one of the funnest movies I've watched in a while. A lot of movies are enjoyable but this was exciting to watch. Great cast and effects. Unrealistic in a good way.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I like the graphics and wats cool is that u get a great white shark so I think you should get the game :)
B000002A33|5.0|it's a great album<br />this band is one of the finest examples of Seattle grunge there is if have never listened to them you should
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|The message and idea are good. The world is awesome and the graphics are nice. It was a good movie but I just didn't love it. I don't think I'd want to watch it again.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|We have children of all ages sharing one tablet.  The younger ones were scared by Temple Run's monkeys. Found this and now all the kids are happy and all like Penguins more!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Well written and touching! Great perspective, something I haven't seen before! I highly recommend this book! What a great read
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would recommend this book to just about anyone. It's not a love story, it's not a cancer story, it's the story of a few people (like everyone else) who have a few &#34;faults&#34; in their stars.
B005LAII8A|1.0|Well I'll try to be nice lol. I really like Bruce Willis movies . But this one was really hard to watch. Slow is putting it lightly. Hard to follow and down right disappointing .I guess you could say the best part of the hole movie was when he killed himself at the end and but us all out of are misery from having to sit and  watch this
1449410243|5.0|Just buy it... your life will be richer for this purchase. Mandatory read for new cat owners with helpful tips like: How to pet a kitty, Direction of ears, Things cats love, and most important.... How to tell if you cat is plotting to kill you. I know now that mine definitely are.
B00337KMAA|5.0|No need to - I gave it five stars.  Don't keep asking for further information.  This is my response. I'm getting annoyed that it will not &#34;submit.&#34;
B00005JLEU|5.0|The story of a petulant child finding her own courage and spirit while surrounded by them! A really good movie!
B002C949KE|3.0|The concepts provided by the author was very interesting and thought provoking, but the conclusions drawn from the experiments were ill conceived. His experiments were vague in origin and mathematical basis but concrete in conclusions which left no room for no other theories.
B009JZTOG8|1.0|If I had known this was a recap of last season, I would not have purchased.  It's offensive to be charged for a summary of season 1.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|With all the recent media attention on North Korea and Kim Jong-un, this book gives marvelous insight into what is REALLY going on. I've learned about what it really means to live in a state-run totalitarian regime. This is like a real life 1984.
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|I thought the password option was a great idea. But it is very weak. When you open your Kindle and click the app you must enter your password. When you close the app and do another task and then go back there is NO SECURITY! The app just opens right up for anyone to see your notes. You must shut down your Kindle to lock the app. Only when you restart and got to the app does it prompt you for the password. This app really can not be secured.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|Ordered my first pair of TOMS. I was told to order half a size smaller then your true size because its made out of fabric and will stretch. Im usually a 6 but I ordered a 5.5 and they fit perfectly. I love my TOMS. I cant wait to order some more.
1401907725|5.0|These angel cards as well as other oracle cards by Ms Virtue, work well when I do angelic card readings.  So, I am happy with them!
B008P9M614|5.0|Just discovered Dr. House this past year. The character is like no other on TV - he's a bity, stingy, self-centered doctor who has a knack for just knowing what's wrong with most patients when his crew has no idea. You either like him or not. I do.
0062238868|3.0|my 25 yr old son wanted this book and i accidentally downloaded it to my kindle. my son loved it and he is not a book reader, so i gave it a try.  i found it to be completely over my head with the details and military jargon. i skipped paragraphs that, in my opinion, were too much detail for the story....having said that, it is not the normal type of book that i read.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|The actors do their best with a script that demonstrates no character development and directing that pays no attention to the details that create the world of Middle Earth.  &#34;The Hobbit&#34; is a very poor vision of the Middle Earth we love.<br /><br />Think about any ONE of the &#34;Lord&#34; flicks...clear image of place, characters, moments, motivations, lost opportunities, but hope above all...right?  &#34;The Hobbit&#34; simply capitalizes on the Tolkien name without meeting the requirements of the Tolkien brand.  In other words, it's a cheap and easy way to make a few car payments for Peter Jackson, the studio, and the crew.  We deserve better, and Jackson and those kids have done better.  'Two stars' because the scenery is grand and the actors showed up.<br /><br />Really, you don't at all need to see this if you're trying to fill in any of the holes Tolkien left in his saga. Holes are GOOD: the medieval teller of tales - which I guess Tolkien was - wants the listeners to fill in those holes themselves...so that they'll be engaged and committed to the ultimate resolution of the conflict. Skin in the game.  Saga and myth are not spectator sports.<br /><br />So, save yourself 4 bucks.  If you don't want to read more Tolkien, well, then, just pour yourself some mead, close your eyes, and let loose the dragons and dwarves in your imagination.  You'll do better than &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&#34;.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|my only concern is that i was charged for single episode and the whole season!  also I signed up for the 30 days<br />of prime but was still charged imediately.
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|I have never been so disappointed in a movie.  It was sort of like a movie made w/medicore name stars(I do not c onsider Jamie Foxx much more than that.)  It was a farce, and not a good one.  A black man in 1870's, wearing leather??pants, sporting sunglasses , hunting white men ???  I assumed the movie would have a reasonable plot.. but we all klnow what assuming makes me.  I am surprised Leonard  Dicapprio(sp?) would be in such a movie.  I guess desperate to make money movie stars will do just about anything.  Fortunately I was able to rent it and not have to pay the high prices at the movie theater.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|So coooooky. And funnier than the books. Wasn't sure what to expect. I like how they changed it up a bit from the books as well. Lovvvvvvvve Sookies character!
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|While Webber is not J.R.R.Tolken, he weaves a compelling, attention-holding story.<br /><br />My only problem with this book is that he seems to think that someone might sympathize with his villains, and so tries to make the story darker and deeper by making them commit atrocities- which, admittedly, extrudes naturally from the plot- but wasn't really needed for the story. Due to this fact, I wouldn't recommend this book for non-adults - which is a shame, as good books are few and far between.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very good game especially for free. would recommend this to anyone looking for a good game<br />love this game loads
B006JPS1OM|5.0|If it will STOP shutting down at Chap 2 Have to totally replay all and BAM! ends at Chapter 2 again. Uninstall and reload again and STILL does same thing again. Wasted $2.99  So disgusted.
0823016714|3.0|nice variation with gender, race, and age.<br />contains alot of facial expressions. love the different angles and povs.<br />interesting art work samples ( some are not good)<br />can learn alot from the book.  but a number of facial expressions are too  forced and fake. some are unusable.<br />nice thing to have. but not a necessity.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Not many books make me laugh out loud and nod my head vigorously in agreement--this one did.<br /><br />Ms Fey nails so many issues facing women with wit and flair and my only complaint is that I wish it had been twice as long.
0312944926|2.0|OK, I feel I should preface this by saying I considered myself a Dan Brown fan--love his Robert Langdon books. So I picked this up at a used book store expecting more of the same, or at least the same quality. I felt like I just read something by a totally different author. The plot sounded OK on the back cover, but inside it was just nonsensical. Where are the good characterizations? These were just cardboard stereotypes. I'm glad this wasn't the first Dan Brown I read, or I'd never have read another.
B00BJS7104|5.0|From beginning to end, full of action, a great story line and hats to Jamie Fox, Leonardo, Samuel great performance.  Great for all<br />cowboy movie buffs, yahoo!! not yahoo.com either...LOL...
B0060AY6FO|5.0|It is a unique idea. This is a really fun read for both Jane Austin & P.D. James readers. You will enjoy it.
B000QCQ970|5.0|I've given this book five stars because it's one of the best verbal descriptions of what happens in between technique and intuition. Mr. Waitzkin is able to clearly articulate how the mental processes he used in chess also apply to martial arts in such a way that the reader can have a deep look into his internal processes. The structure of the book, building up to the last chapter also makes for pleasurable and riveting read (you don't want to put the book down). But more importantly, this book has inspired me to dig deeper into my own learning and how I teach. A must read for artists and teachers!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I would give this app a higher rating on android, google play has the updates available, the game itself with no software issues has had me hooked for months now. I got all my friends into it and we post more on each other's game walls than we do on Facebook. But ever since my boyfriend &quot;upgraded&quot; me from android to the kindle fire, the game is constantly freezing up or not loading at all to begin with.  This is my favorite game to play, but it looks like I just won't be able to play on my new tab.  Anyone else running this on a kindle?
B005C9YZIW|5.0|(thanks to the BBC for providing me with a review copy!)<br /><br />The Planet Earth series has set a new gold standard for what nature programs should be. It features wonderful information, great music, excellent narration and, oh, my goodness...the sights. The sights! If you haven't got an HDTV, this title alone is valid reason to get one. It's just flat-out beautiful to look at, and the best way to look at it is through blu ray.<br /><br />And I'm not kidding. On my TV (1080p, 42 inches), it looks just stunning. I really could go on for days about how perfect the picture is. The series never looked this good when shown on TV, and it doesn't even look as good streaming (I own the whole set on Amazon Instant Video). It's truly a wonder to behold.<br /><br />Planet Earth, the Six Disc Special Edition contains not only all eleven episodes of the ground-breaking series, but you also get a whole raft of special bonus features, including a special about the snow leopard, one about the Mayan underworld, another focusing on elephants trying to survive in the Namibian desert (better them than me!), as well as commentaries, production diaries, \\"Planet Earth: The Future\\", a sneak peek at Frozen Planet and, fascinatingly, a music-only option. Yes, you can sit down and simply listen to the music as you watch the incredible beauty unfold on your screen.<br /><br />Better still, for those of us in the USA, you get David Attenborough's original narration. Don't get me wrong; Sigourney Weaver did just fine. But, well, Attenborough. The guy's just flat-out incredible, and really knows his stuff. He makes for a much better VO choice than Weaver did.<br /><br />This really is the best nature documentary series ever made. Blu ray really is the best way to see it. If you want a great way to celebrate Earth Day, or really just want to have a great time watching some TV, this is a perfect choice. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has a lot of challenging puzzles.  The colors are pretty and it's a great escape to unwind.  I need to unwind...
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a powerful story, very vivid portrayal of a tough road of a child in the foster system.  Was a wonderful book, I highly recommend it to anyone.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This app has helped me get through statistics class. I would definitely recommend it.  I love being able to write the problems instead of just punching keys.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|Kindle doesnt have a straight forward app for the camera for some reason so this does the trick perfectly!  (Kindle Fire HD 8.9)
B007REV4YI|5.0|Craig makes Bond bad ass again.  Brings the whole series up to date with the 21st century. I'm looking forward to the next Bond movie with Daniel Craig.
B007PVHANM|5.0|So moving and educational. Not many people know what his life was like. And to get some background and insight on this amazing mans life was awesome.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Get ready for a wild ride!  Nothing else to add without giving away how spiral and screwed are synonyms.  Wow!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|(I will come back and get into details)<br />The typing of notes is super fast on the kindle because of the swipe keyboard ability, something Apple does not offer. You can organise all your notes into notebooks and you can add tags for easy searching options later on.<br />My major complain is that after I have entered a statement it is hard to edit the whole thing to bold or underline, highlighting more than one word seems impossible. Maybe I am not doing something right. I will get back to this review shortly.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Love the apps ability to add text to the tape's line items, and the ability to transition to Tape View.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game doesn't require a lot of skill to build your village. You buy animals to build your village and collect from the animals.  You are assigned goals such as buy two mammoths and complete their family.  You use coins you've collected to make your purchases.  You also collect acorns.  These are much harder to get but you can buy them through Amazon.  A recent goal was to buy a. animal for $450 ACORNS!  It would cost $30 real money to buy enough acorns or months to earn enough to complete this goal.  I'm a fairly new player but if this game continues to assign goals this outrageous I probably won't. be a ling term player.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Totally black and white movie.  Moves along at a good pace.  Boy loses his dog after crazy girl tells him something big is going to happen because her cat made his initial in the litter box.  Good yuk factor in that bit.  Adults will see other horror movie characters like a kid who resembles Igor from Frankenstein movies (or Quasimodo), a kid who looks a lot like Frankenstein's monster, a kid who I believe is supposed to resemble a scientist from a Godzilla movie and that creepy little girl with the cat could be one of the kids from The Twilight Zone.  It's fun to pick up the gags, like the poodles new hair, the end is right out of another movie, the experiments etc.  Lots of fun and wit.
B008393Q2O|2.0|It crashed the first time I made a list. I found it clunky to use and it didn't seem to understand Swype as well as other apps I have. There are some nice features (adjustable text size being one), but it lacks finesse. I'll stay with ColorNote.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After seeing and enjoying the movie, I decided to try reading the book.  It's not my usual type of book, but I did enjoy it.  It caught my interest right away and I finished reading it within a week.  I just bought the next book in the series and can't wait to start.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can take my tablet with me to the dr office or where the laptop in not so convient#or to much
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I tried to use the cable with a standard USB to outlet adapter to charge the kindle so we would need to hook it up to the laptop to charge.  After a month we burned the cable out.  So, I ordered a new cable and a Kindle adapter to wall charge the Kindles.<br /><br />No problems if you use the right adapter.  My mistake.
0783240287|5.0|I found this movie entertaining.  I really like the music and Donny Osmond.  It was great.<br />  Thank you so much, candpfoote
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|I like it because it is upbeat but it is def not Tegan & Sara from days of yore. Still good listening!
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|it it poor I hate it sure it<br />s free but do NOT wa<br />st your time on this.  It does not have enough time and half the time it dose not even worried rights
B002OKO1GI|4.0|An oldie but a goody.  My daughter loved the movie.  It's an older movie but we were trying to find something to watch with our kids on movie night and started thinking about the movies that were popular family movies during the '70s and '80s.  This was a hit and the whole family is involved in this movie.  There really isn't one main character, Beethoven and his family have co-staring rolls.  Great fun.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I just love this movie.  I have watched it many times.  I didn't know Queen Victoria's history and I find it very fascinating.<br />  Thank you candpfoote
B00101ZOTA|5.0|I should have known who &#34;dunnit,&#34; but no.  It came out in '95 and I didn't watch it until 2013. I loved it!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|What an amazing story. Touched my heart. This was a simple reminder that you can get though anything in life.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I loved every page of this book from beginning to end. I think it is an inspirational story about the power of the human spirit. I will be having my 2 teenage sons read this as I never want to hear the words \\"I can't\\" again!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I bought this for our daughter and her family for next Christmas.  They watch it every year for the Holidays<br />  Thanks candpfoote.
B004S5C91Q|4.0|I could not put this book down.  Sadly, things like this have happened in the world recently. Very interestingly written from the child's point of view.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing book! I was disappointed when I finished it because I wanted it to keep going! Francie is an amazing character and the other characters seem so alive. I felt like I was right along with Francie in all her troubles and happiness. I love this book! It seems like real life, it is so believeable. I cried, laughed, and smiled right along with the Nolans. Please read this excellent book and be ready for one of the best reads of your life!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I had missed seeing this at the movies. Very glad I bought the Blu-ray set. I most certainly will watch this more than one at home on Blu-ray, and can travel with the DVD and watch it again.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This was a great movie to show the industrial revolution  in Britain.  We really enjoyed watching it.<br />  Thank you, candpfoote
B00AAQHP66|5.0|It is an increadable movie and so much meaning about life, great story and would really recommend it for all to see
B009UX2YAC|5.0|espicially with the save me keys Subway Surf this app is basicly temple run they are both very fun though
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Great CD, always loved Bowie!!<br />Some songs I had to warm up to at first.<br />The CD is well worth the money....
B000784WMW|5.0|I have really enjoyed Jane Eyre for years and this one is very good.  I have watched several times.<br />  Thank you,  candpfoote
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Awesome movie! I really liked the musical Les Miserables. I was so lucky my grandma actually bought it for me as a surprise from Wal-Mart. This is a lady who, just the day before, took me grocery shopping and spent quite a bit. Then she gave me the movie too. I about died! Great phenomenal movie.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|There are better super hero movies with better story lines and better special effects out there.  The Avengers is one of them.  I was disappointed by this movie.  It's just not as entertaining or innovative as Batman Begins.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best game app out there. Challenging, fun, even funny sometimes! Slick graphics, surprising obstacles and new twists as you go along. Highly recommended.
1419705849|5.0|I am a retired teacher. I know how much my students loved these books. This is how I would get the reluctant readers to read. Now I am buying them for my grandson.
B009KNPNT6|4.0|Great Remastering.  Very clean recordings.<br />&#34;Slowhand&#34; comes across as a very laid back album.  Much more than I recall.<br />What really made this package worthwhile to me are the nine live tracks.<br />A good clean previously unreleased concert recording.<br />Some more great Clapton solos.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie.  We were in the mood for an action packed movie with good special effects and a decent storyline.  This movie fit the bill.
B0049J0CTM|1.0|The movie finally showed up on my menu. I spent $2.00 to rent a movie for my flight to Orlando and all it did was load! The movie never actually played and I want to know how to get a refund...
B00004XQ83|5.0|I love this C.D. I listen to it all the time. At home and in the car. The songs are so varied.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I love when u talk to him and he's like a translator so please please please buy talking Tom the cat
B009329ZF2|3.0|Good CG effects...  That's about it.  Not much of a plot.  Liam Neeson makes a couple of appearances, but is not a main character.<br /><br />Great for if you're in the mood for watching CG special effects, but not worth watching twice...  Rent, don't buy this one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My daughter likes that you can choose different characters and you can use power ups. It is similar to Temple Run.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|I love this series. I've seen it before, but it was just as fun to watch the second time around.  The quality of the DVDs is superb.
B009Y6UCRC|5.0|Love this album--Joe and Beth are a match made in heaven!  I just learned about Joe Bonamassa and this is the fourth album of his I've bought so far.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|This game is awesome but on my kindle fire it keeps shutting down and forces me to start the entire game over. Please fix!
B00407PNY2|5.0|Nothing like setting in your recliner and watch Bullitt on the big screen!!!  Talk about the recliner getting a workout from all the bouncing and jumping around as I watched the movie... Love the way Steve McQueen double clutches the gears in the Mustang...
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|If this is any indication as to how the new album is going to turn out, we're about to be satisfied beyond our expectations. This may be the grooviest, funkiest, catchiest Daft Punk song made to date. I can hardly wait another minute for  Random Access Memories to be released.
B00356CO1E|5.0|I did week 1 of this video and lost 3 lbs, my \\"love handles\\" melted away and my arms and waist started to take on my pre-baby look again.  I was sore for a few days, but it wasn't anything I couldn't still carry on my daily duties with.<br /><br />Then, I thought I would get the Ripped in 30 DVD at the store.  1 day of doing that video my knees were killing me.  I couldn't bend down without feeling like they were going to give out.  I noticed no difference after a week of completing week 2 of that DVD.  I like the way Jillian talks to the viewers in the 30 Day Shred whereas the Ripped in 30 is her smacking her assistants and saying a lot of \\"get after it!!!\\" which is distracting for me.<br /><br />So, I'm sticking with the 30 Day Shred - better results and easier on the knees.  I feel like there is more aerobic/movement type exercises rather than planks with jumps like in the other DVD.
B0034G4P26|4.0|One of those animated films that is just plain fun for everyone. I am um. lets say over 50 and loved it.
B00013RC8O|5.0|There is nothing like watching the orginal movie &#34;Vanishing Point&#34;... the folks today try to put their spin on the new version.. I like the orginal movie better...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book I have ever read and I bet catching fire is even better! Love it! And u will too!
B007ZMD14I|4.0|I heard the song &#34;Anastasia&#34; on the radio and had to buy this release!<br />Love the intro....and the two awesome leads he throws in. I've listened to<br />the song over and over......just can't get enough.<br />There is a diverse collection of songs, and most of them are quite good.<br />I had not followed Slash's career until now.....I have a new respect for his work.<br />Myles Kennedy lends a supersonic voice  and lyrics.<br />You can hear some of their influences, such as the rhythm on &#34;Bad Rain&#34;<br />(sounds like &#34;Immigrant Song&#34; by Led Zep.<br />Overall I'm am happy with my purchase and searching out some of Slash's previous music!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Twelfth time,  still amazing to read. Kudos to Suzanne Collins. This is a legendary series. I absolutely love these books.<br />.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|Love the old racing movies that Steve McQueen was in...Great racing action and great scenes caught on film.. I would recommend it to people who enjoy Steve McQueen movies..
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game is fun but there is a problem on mine. You'll have to watch the moving controls cause if you don't you'll die. Other than that this game is great.
B00C32TPZE|5.0|This is a must-have for Volbeat fans!<br />The infusion of a new guitarist makes for an entertaining mix.<br />You get the great singing as usual, and some awesome guitar work.<br />This is a themed collection of songs about the old west outlaws.<br />There is a certain western twang in some of the acoustic guitars.<br />Some of the synchronized guitar rhythms and leads push you into the metal edge of music.<br />The singer has that sincere angst in his voice that keeps you emotionally charged.<br />I was happy to see they had given up on the &#34;Growling&#34; lyrics. Why growl and Scream<br />if you have such a awesome voice. I wish they would remake a few of their songs on<br />some of their previous releases, and use his pure singing talent.<br />I seldom find an album with more than a few good songs, but I play it all the way through.<br />You won't be disappointed....
B009MF5BXK|5.0|What a exciting movie to watch with so many action film people involved with the plot and making it such a great movie to watch.. I can watch it over and over all the time..
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game on Facebook and I'm so glad to finally have it on my kindle! It so much easier to play it on a tablet than on a pc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game.  It should have specific breeds of different colors so we can choose ones to look like our own.  I miss my Arab that I lost to colic last September : (
B00AREIAI8|3.0|NOT A LOT TO DO IN THIS app. I wish there were additional talks to occupy your time while you wait on your jobs to finish.
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|I'm a big Elvis fan and this cd is Great!!!  Love his music.. Wish he was still around to entertain today..
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|I liked it for the history details  of that period. I was a teenager during that time and spent over 3 years in service during the war that followed. being a foolish teenager I was unaware of many of the details brought out in the book though I like most was aware of the stress and different opinions of my parents friends. Both English and German. I was pro England.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I cannot believe I made myself finish this book for the worst ending I have ever read!  It made no sense at all.

B006ZZAN60|5.0|Ever since I first heard \\"The Mummer's Dance\\" on [[ASIN:B00000DMH7 Pure Moods, Vol. II]], I have been enchanted with the deep, emotionally charged singing of Loreena McKennitt. Few artists have her talent of weaving such haunting melodies that reach into the innermost chambers of your heart and take hold. When I had first heard that Loreena McKennit had performed a live concert, I jumped at the opportunity to see it for myself. I first watched it on YouTube and was completely enthralled: I had to buy it. Once I had bought it, I was pleased to see that the concert on the DVD was available in 5.1 surround sound, which greatly enhances the listening experience. It also came with a companion CD with all of the songs performed in concert.<br /><br />I was pleased to hear live versions of songs from [[ASIN:B000002LT2 The Visit]], which I believe to be her best album, as well as highlights from several other great albums, including [[ASIN:B000002MMS The Mask and Mirror]], [[ASIN:B002ZDOXLW An Ancient Muse]], and [[ASIN:B000J233SK The Book of Secrets]]. My favorites from Nights From the Alhambra are her slightly abbreviated version of \\"The Lady of Shalott,\\" a very moving rendition of \\"Raglan Road,\\" and my all-time favorites \\"All Souls Night\\" and \\"The Old Ways.\\" All of these were performed in a very Middle Eastern flavor, which proved a welcome departure from the stodgy traditionalism that sometimes surrounds Celtic and Folk music genres.<br /><br />The takeaway from all of this is if you enjoy folk music with a blend of both Celtic and Middle Eastern influences, you should not miss this concert. If you don't know if you'd enjoy this, listen to it regardless; it may change your mind.
0307749347|4.0|Found this shampoo in a hotel while traveling.  Loved it and decided to order.  I can only find it in small tubes and would love to be able to buy it by the bottle.
B001QB9ETK|3.0|The movie presents complex characters in a very quick fashion. The storyline itself is very interesting, and the movie is beautifully shot.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|When I start up the game I'll be able look at the main menu then it says doodle god<br /> has stopped working.
B000067FP8|5.0|If there is a movie that took itself less seriously, I'd be hard pressed to think of one. I can't explain Gremlins 2 as being a complete departure from the camp horror of the first Gremlins; rather I have to say that it took this camp to a whole new level. Where the first Gremlins was significantly darker, Gremlins 2 renews itself in a rather self-deprecating manner, not caring a whit about maintaining any sense of seriousness. It is cartoonish in its zaniness, and I loved every minute of it.
0345525558|5.0|The Language of Flowers tears your heart apart, throws the pieces in four directions and then put it all back together again. The book is 'unputdownable'! It weaves back and forth from the present to the past and manages to intertwine both in an integral way. Victoria's life is saved from self destruction and parental rejection by the loving foster mother who reveals to her the language of flowers and thus unveiled all the talents and natural intelligence that had lain hidden in her until then. This book should be a must read for anyone thinking of entering the Foster Care system as a foster parent or a social worker. In the end the books shows that unconditional love does conquer all!!
B00007J5VN|4.0|Shirley MacLaine is a delight as Charity Hope Valentine. It includes the alternate ending. I think I would prefer a combination of both endings.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was completely hooked from book 1 to 3. I would recommend to anyone. Not the usual fairy tale story
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Not Morton's best, but well worth the effort.  I would recommend.  It is along the same lines as Downton Abbey.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|If you enjoy Raymond Feist and Terry Goodkind you will enjoy this book. It has the warmth of Feist and the harshness of Goodkind.  All in all a very good read.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app!  It makes keeping track of your battery power level and amount of time for reading, Internet surfing, etc... I definitely recommend this app for everyones kindle fire!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It took me a long time to decide to try this one, but after hearing my friends talk about it week after week, I thought I would give it a try.  I downloaded the first season late one evening and started watching.  My husband wandered into the room and was immediately caught up in it.  We both stayed up late into the night watching.  By the end of the weekend we had completed seasons 1and 2.  We are looking forward to another watching marathon for season 3.  Don't know how we will fare when we are caught up and have to wait a whole week between episodes.

B001PPLIFU|4.0|This is not the best Bond movie, but Daniel Craige is the best Bond period! He portrays the character in a new light, and though not as good a story or villian as Casino Royale, it still has that grounded Bond vibe that Craige portrays so well.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love a good mystery and suspense book. It kept me on the edge wondering and trying to figure out what happened all the way to the end! It didn't disappoint my need to be impressed with the tie in ending! Great story!
0142421715|1.0|Things go very, very downhill in the second book. Why? I'm not entirely sure. It's just boring. Very, very boring. I tried to force myself to finish it, but I finally decided that it wasn't worth trying to force my way through. The storyline seems to completely lose momentum, and the characters aren't interesting enough to drive things without it. That's a huge issue. The first book was largely (in my opinion) carried by the world and the plot, but this book takes us out of that world and the plot slows to a crawl. The characters simply aren't deep enough or interesting enough to carry things on their own. Ultimately I gave up on this book and I have no interest in finishing the series.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I Up Graded This Clock From The Alarm Clock To Get Rid Of The Ads. and This App Looks Much Better.
B00164CM46|5.0|Great funny movie. Brad Pitts character is great, the dialogue and scenery is excellent. Just an overall quality comedic movie.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|its a great game but it keeps freezing up on me. I tried to re install it but it keeps freezing up. could be better IMO
B000JIHP88|5.0|I actually bought this mobile from a garage sale for $5.00 not knowing if it even worked. My first son had horrible acid reflux and this was the ONLY thing that soothed him. We have a crib w/ attached changing table and we have the mobile on the crib so he can see it from the changing table. We used this mobile until he was close to 18 months old (he learned how to turn it on himself and would put himself to sleep with it). Now with my second son same story, he is very colicky and he absolutely loves this mobile, he will sit and watch it and stop crying instantly when it is turned on. I am tempted to buy another one just to have one in our living room too!
B0072GPPNC|5.0|I really liked this movie. It is very interesting story and it has a happy ending. Spielberg did his usual good job on this movie.
B001Q7JD3Q|5.0|Awesome remake of the this classic. The score was phenomenal!<br />Naomi Watts' beauty was adequate without being distracting and Jack Blacks performance one of his best.<br />The kids loved it, too. Matter of fact, it was their idea to rent it.
B008476HBM|5.0|To this day there are few writers that are able to compete with Jane Austin and write with so much wisdom and understanding about  hopes, dreams, families, and personal relationships. How much are we mistaken even today because of Pride  and Prejudice ?
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I love this book!!!! These series has me crying and all emotional. I'm as addicted as I was with 50, but not as embarrassed if someone knew what Iwas reading.
B003QP4NPE|4.0|I had a great time reading this book!  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the ending isn't as satisfying as I hoped it would be.  Even so, I will keep reading more of Suarez' books because this was very entertaining.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love pintrest.  I get soooo many ideas from this site. This is my go to site.  From homemade, cleaners, to kid crafts,  or a new recipe.  This site is seriously awesomesauce.
B0071BGOJC|2.0|I am a big fan of Ken Follett's books, read and purchased all of them.  Most of them were more than fair, 'The pillars of the Earth&#34; was very good. The first book , &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;, was extremely well written, well researched. I read it during one weekend,  couldn't let the book down.  I bought the book for family and friends and waited impatiently for the second book to be published.<br />  This time the characters are predictable and even a good part of the plot is predictable, childish or shallow. Every person who knows something about the Second World War understands right from the first pages the fate awaiting  handicapped children. This time I felt that apart of Midway, which I presume is based on true facts, most of the plot was written from restricted &#34;general knowledge&#34;.  For example, would you believe that one incident alone makes young von Ulrich understand that his parents were not making up the tragedy of mass murder while he believes so strongly in his genius Fuhrer ?  Some mix of issues like a bit of homosexuality, puppy-love, incredible espionage are beneath Follett's ability to tell a good story. I expected much more.  I still expect it from the third trilogy book. The only comfort was kindle reading!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This Film is Great !!<br />I think the people didn't know too much about this story of John Carter when appeared in the cinemas (at least, not like Marvel stories). For that reason, It didn't bring the audience expected for the studios.<br />I really hope they can make the 2nd part. Now the escenario has changed, many people know about John Carter's story and they are fans of It.<br />So, next time for sure, It will be a blockbuster !!!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I was shocked at the wonferful singing & music selection on this album. Put together wonderfully!  Great listening from beginning to end!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Brings back bed time stories' memories. Timeless classic in any language. Curse pirates of the Caribbean though for replacing my imagination of pirates and treasures.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is awesome. The moment I saw it,I bought it. I would of not of mind if I paid $4.99 for the game. If you are looking for the best game then it is right here.I would highly recommend it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I don't care what the movie was like but this book was impossible to put down. I love every word and will count it in my top ten favorite books of all time.
B004KKX80A|5.0|This Beyblade consistently wins in all the stadiums and seems to be much stronger and robust than many of the others.  My son and his father are always fighting over who gets to use it when they play.  Great purchase according to my boys.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone!  It's a cult, satircal movie that is fun!  I had seen it in theaters at midnight showings about seven times!  The audiance participation in the theaters was/is fun and I like the DVD because you get to &#34;hear&#34; lines in the movie that you might have missed in the theater.  GREAT movie!!!!!
B0068MNO4S|2.0|I am an Stratfordian, let's get that clear from the get/go. I am however not someone who would hate a movie because of the message.    My favorite movies are Shawshank, Green mile, Benny&Joon, THHGTG, Lord of the Rings. I can enjoy History of the World part I, Robin Hood, Spartacus, Gladiator, and others that take history as inspiration... yet deviate for entertainment purposes.  The good things about those movies were that they were internally consistent.    I wanted to see this movie to see how the anti-Strats would bring their message, and I have to say not very well.  But halfway the movie, I found myself not caring... not caring whatsoever, if the Spanish Armada had shown up and won the day (not all that unusual in the fictional history in this movie) and I was asked if the characters in the movie had to be spared?? My answer would probably be which answer ends this movie faster.    The images are great mind you that is why it gets a few points but the characters, not one of them I could care about. The queen was too dumb to be a secret mother of all those boys (no girls as far as I could tell but I didn't care, remember) and too much into bedding everything in pants and not interested in state which seems to be unusually odd. DeVere was unbelievable in his attempt to put politics in plays without the ones paid to spot it finding out, while the commoners of London spotted it immediately.... And for an author with so many brilliant comedic plays and scenes, this representation does not have any sense of humour at all.    Shakespeare was way to uneducated and dumb to be a convincing front-man. Jonson... odd, a man of the theater not recognizing good/great plays when he sees it?? Marlowe, in very good shape for a man dead for years... (sorry but that was so totally stupid, the death of Marlowe was Shakespeare's opening in playwriting)    So no unfortunately even though i am hugely interested in the subject of Shakespeare authorship, and love to read other people'sopinions, debate them and learn ever more, I saw Shakespeare's Henry V last summer (historical incorrect probably, but entertaining), that play made me forget the blisters under my feet (groundling = standing room only) with nothing more than a few pieces of furniture to make a scene...
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I saw the original Phantom of the Opera live in a showing years ago and this was definitely a worthy sequel. I loved the music, the story and the new ways we get to see these old and familiar characters.  We got to see them out of their old roles and finally see where they ended up.  If you like musicals, get this and the original, then watch this.  If you like the original then get this.  This was great.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What can I say... blue ray dvds are always a guarantee, they look very good, and sound even better. I like this complete saga set because it has lots of never seen documentaries you won't find anywhere else.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love it can't wait to read th  last  book!!! Love love it! I hope that one day I'll find me a love that amazing g!
B00BQBNK04|5.0|love love love this sound track, I will listen to this over and over again. The clarity is amazing along with the performers.

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Great app love all the different kinds of Dragon s !! ! It's a little time consuming butI enjoy playing it:)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Slow in the beginning, but the ending is worth it all. Highly recommended, very very good book. With an amazing ending
B008K6HN8I|5.0|there is noting better and easier to use out there now for the kindle fire HD i look almost everywhere
0517543052|5.0|This book is my favorite. And I read, a lot. Recently bought another copy for a friend to read as well. Definitely recommend to everyone, religious or not. It doesn't favor any one particular belief, but draws from them all without actually bringing up god. I suppose it's a non-threatening spiritual-type read, and the hand drawn accompanying illustrations are phenomenal.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have enjoyed each and every song even the Christmas music that played quite unexpectedly.  I have played it over and over.
B00867GJYK|5.0|3 disk set is the way to go!  We get one DVD for the car and one for the Living Room. Ellen Degenerous is funny as heck!
B0056BMK6K|3.0|The author spends too much time describing himself rather than suggested techniques, lots of filler in his books. His technique suggests a lot of social network activity which I have not found to be a great catalyst.
B00333IA1M|4.0|Item arrived on time and as described. A bit damaged, and the book started to fall apart while reading, but this was expected due to the age of the book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Like all of John's books the story is well thought out and the reader is in suspence most of the time.  John Grisham fans will enjoy &#34; The Racheteer&#34; very much.
1451696191|4.0|Love the book! His writing style is a little hard to adjust to at first, but improves as the book goes along! Also the climax was a little soon for me leaving the end a little monotonous, but all in all it was a good read and I would definitely recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Too much of a woman's emotional crap thinking - who cares about the details of how she FEELS about it all!!
B0037471TE|5.0|Undoubtedly one of my all time favorites. I first saw this book on my friend's table, he ran a musical instruments store, and I casually flipped through it, then began reading it, till he had to tell me to leave since he was closing! I must have read this several times after that. Ludlum's plot was unique for its time, the action fast paced, the settings so international and satisfying to read about. His descriptions are very visual and he has understood what some readers want. His story takes you deep into the world of espionage and assassinations, weaving a gripping a fascinating tale of a man who has lost his memory. I would definitely recommend this to all those wishing to try Ludlum for the first time.
1451626088|4.0|I have read quite a few of Phillipa Gregory's novels and have read most of the Cousin's War Series, but I have tackled the series out of order and I do not feel like this has impeded my understanding of the subject. I began with Lady of the Rivers, then I read the White Queen and now the Kingmaker's Daughter. I have not read the Red Queen.<br /><br />The Kingmaker's Daughter is another sister novel from Phillipa Gregory and focuses on the two daughters of Richard Neville (the king maker during the War of the Roses), Isabel and Anne Neville. I felt the beginning of the book (first 50 pages) was bit repetitive and puerile. The entire book is told from Anne's point of view, and in the opening chapters she is quite young and constantly talking of the sleepy king and the bad queen. I almost gave up on the book and I most likely would have, but news broke that archaeologists had found Richard III. Wow! What an amazing coincidence and thus I felt more compelled to finish the novel.<br /><br />Richard Neville, the Earl of Warwick has no sons and thus uses his daughters for political positioning. Richard trained young men such as Edward IV and Richard III to become kings. Once Edward IV marries Elizabeth Woodville, Neville finds that Elizabeth has taken over his role as adviser and his opinion is no longer valued in court. Anne and Isabel dream of one day becoming Queen of England and this is only spurred by their presence at Elizabeth Woodville's coronation. They witness the glamor and elegance of her court and aspire to that lifestyle. Their father now sets them up for this opportunity by marrying Isabel off to George, Duke of Clarence, the king's brother. He marries Anne off to Edward of Westminster, the son of the sleeping king and bad queen.<br /><br />For Anne, tragedy strikes when her husband and her father are killed in battle. She is put into the custody of her sister and her sister's husband who attempt to control the Neville fortune. She then escapes to sanctuaryat a church and later marries Richard III. Richard III is most noted for \\"losing track\\" of his nephews, the Princes in the Tower. The Kingmaker's Daughter addresses this mystery, the relationship of the sisters, and Anne's relationship with Richard. Between the sisters, they suspect Elizabeth Woodville (and her mother) of witchcraft and attempting to poison their families. Why? Anne and Isabel's father executed Elizabeth's father and brother. These are all well known moments of English History, but Gregory's writing brings all these characters to life once again.
B003CNQPNS|5.0|love the tv show and i have to watch when ever.  Would recommend this to every one to buy it
0345803507|1.0|Ok, I'm a little late to the party, but finally succumbed to the hype after a neighbor lent me the trilogy. WHY do people love these books?  They're horribly written, the so-called plots are amateurish and stupid, and the characters are amazingly annoying. Let's make a list!<br /><br />1. The characters don't speak much. Instead, they whisper, growl, and \\"breathe\\" words.<br />2. The stupid heroine said \\"oh, my\\" so often I started hearing it in George Takei's voice each time I read it.<br />3. The stupid heroine is supposedly mature enough to fall into a serious relationship, had a difficult upbringing, and has just graduated college...yet she refers to her genitals as, \\"down there\\" and doesn't masturbate??<br />4. This isn't romance. This is abuse and co-dependence. The heroine isn't brave and plucky, she's immature and makes horrible life decisions. The hero isn't tragic and damaged, he's controlling and abusive and childish. In real life any sane woman would flee from this man and then get a restraining order to prevent him from coming within 50 feet of her. (See what I did there?  That \\"50 shades of...\\" crap is strewn throughout these books.)<br />5. ...I could keep going, but there are too many points to type.<br /><br />Overall, these read like a high-school girl wrote them. The characters are caricatures, the story line is dull, and the incessant emailing between the main characters was just freaking annoying. Were these people teenagers or adults??  The sex is just silly. I really don't understand the hype about the \\"smut\\" aspect, as just about any other modern romance handles it better. I wish I hadn't read these. In fact, I skipped over whole pages in the last book because I just couldn't force myself to read the mess. Please, please - if you haven't read these, and you like good books, run far far away!
B004SH40BQ|5.0|i was so worried about this item, i wanted to cut me free from the wires. it was to arrive 3-5 day from when i ordered it. however when i place the order not but 10 minutes later it said it was being shipped. i got it 2 day later, WOW really. that was a really great start. so still being skeptical, and hoping for the best, i put it in my ipod classic turned on my headset and BOOM i was free. i am so excited to have this. buy it if this is what you are looking for. i absolutely love it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple and easy to use. Love that the numbers are big and easy to see. I would definitely recommend to friends and family.
B00ARAOBKS|2.0|Despite the fine acting from the cast, especially Matthew McConaughey, this flick is pretentious and boring. The plot drags, and the material is all to familiar, with the loser son in trouble with drug dealers and his trailer-trash family. Supposedly shocking scenes didn't shock me; I'm inured to gross, nausea-inducing scenes. I thought I might buy a copy of the unrated version, which just includes approximately one minute of footage of the \\"chicken blowjob\\" scene. Not worth the money. Also, I don't recommend this movie to anybody.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|This is a movie tht is so enjoyable to watch and for once, has a positive ending.  Acting was excellant.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is such a wonderfully human, compassionate story of true friendship and the infinite capacity for change.<br /><br />Well told.<br /><br />I loved it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a fun and addicting game you would want to buy. It is a great placed go  play with friends and have fun by being creative. I suggest you buy it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Nothing like being 4 years behind and totally out of it when it comes to mainstream TV, but I thoroughly enjoyed it despite the incorrect rulings by the judge. Her questions on cross-examination were completely permissible!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Wow, this true story is one of true heroes who deserve emense gratitude from every American. And is truly inspiring.
B00AH69BPM|4.0|It seems ironic that Lulu, the collaboration with Lou Reed was released October 2011, and due to the poor reviews, and poor sales, the Metalli dudes decided to release the Beyond Magnetic EP, which was a smart move. Hate Train should have been on Death Magnetic, it is a really good song, with Lars actually adding some really cool drum fills towards the end. Just A Bullet Away sounds like a B side. To Hell And Back could have been in a modern day western movie, and Rebel Of Babylon ends the set with a serious punch. I will always buy their music (besides Lulu), and if you need some new Metalli music, pick this one up!!!
B000023VR6|3.0|His debut is great!, but his album is okay. I think that half of the tracks and great and the other half is just filler or boring. I would recommend his first album over this but this is worth a spin if you really like his music.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie is worth renting.  I would recommend this movie for any age.  It's suspensefula and entertaining.  I would recommend it!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I had got this game when I first got my kindle fire. It is really fun but I believe that some of the levels are pretty challenging! Also I hope there is gonna be more levels because I have completed it. Overall I think that you should get it.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|this is easy to use, has enough menu options and exercise variations to keep it interesting. here are 4 words.
B0000062FL|3.0|This is a review of the 1998 Santana Abraxas CD,being promoted by Amazon as being remastered. After listening to it,I'm fully convinced that it's not. Way to much bass,very little seperation otherwise. Reviewing the CD and booklit,nowhere does it say remastered. It says reissue and mastered by.... Amazon needs to contact Sony music/Legacy and get to the bottom of this. Superb songs,disappointing sound.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|I am glad I did not go to the movie theater to see this movie.  The only exciting part is the dance secenes.  Channing and Matthew do a great job at acting.  I am glad I rented it on Amazon.  Some of the acting is low budget and the story line sometimes seems like it's not going anywhere.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Does what I wanted,  nothing more.  It is austere,  but,  what do you want for 99 cents?  Wakes me up!
B007N5YJWK|5.0|In the medium of motion pictures there was no peer to Hitchcock.  There are and were greater artists of greater depth but there are and have been no challengers to the Master's touch at telling a suspenseful story.  This early 'every man in peril' tale seals the deal and demonstrates most graphically Hitchcock's command of the art of entertaining.  Say what you will about his hidden meanings or depth of psychological intent (and I don't really think there was any) what Hitchcock did in directing John Wayne did in acting.  They both knew their audience and never let them down (Okay...maybe...just maybe...but it's debatable).  That's why his career stretched to fifty years and he found favor til the end.  I like this one in particular because it works on several levels at once and the audience knows it and yet can't wait to ride it out.  Just a great great movie and every bit as entertaining as it was when released.  I have no doubt whatsoever that Hitch is redoing his films in heaven for an equally appreciative audience!  (and saving a seat for Miss Hedren...as only a gentleman would)
B0084IG8TM|4.0|The DVD played well and the case was in good condition, however there was only one disc instead of 2.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is hard to put it down. I get caught up and the time goes by. Good to relive stress.
B0019TSI8W|5.0|I love this film. Jeff Bridges and Barbra Streisand make a lovely duo. Mimi Rodgers is hilarious. Lauren Hutton is gorgeous and so funny. This film reminds me of one from the 1950's. It is warm, and follows the characters' lives in an interesting way. Everyone is given a chance on the screen to be part of the film. I loved it! Barbra Streisand looked great, and was very funny in a self-deprecating way. I highly recommend this film.
B002X02V02|5.0|Have all albums from Lady Gaga.  This one is as good as all the rest if not better... if you like Lady Gaga, you need this.

B007REAIUE|5.0|What a treat this album is from beginning to end.  This isn't your average greaser rock and roll band.  Such a tight sound on all original pieces.  Keep your eyes on these guys because they're going to be big.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is fabulous! I was looking for something as good as fifty shades of Grey to read, and this series is a close runner up to the Fifty Shades series! I couldn't put them down, just kept reading. I've pre-ordered the 3rd book! Can't wait till it releases!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like it ok.  I really like all kinds of mahjong games.  I am like a mahjong guru, lol  bye
B007GCY8FS|4.0|not quite as exciting as the usual.  loved all his mathematical calculations.  can't help but wonder if the CIA and FBI really work like this.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|They say the books are always better then the movie but not even close with this one.<br />Great wardrobe tips.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The DVD came in very good quality (no scratches) and it is an amazing workout!  Overall, highly recommend this workout DVD!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I've just read The Misremembered Man; and was thoroughly engrossed in it.  The parts about life in the orphanage mad me sad and angry; it's hard to believe the last of such places closed less than twenty years ago. On the other hand, the parts about the \\"hero's\\" struggles with his toupee while going to meet his online date for the first time had me laughing out loud.<br /><br />This book had such potential to be corny, and/or maudlin, in turn, and it just ... wasn't.  Highly Recommended.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Got  this for my grand son for his b.day and I am saving it. It was a litte small for it price but Lego's are a little pricey..
B000H305U0|5.0|Got this CD for my older daughter, and she loves it! It came right now time, and in perfect condition! The music was awesome, and fun to listen to!
B00B22IJXK|5.0|If you are a art lover than get this app .you will be able to do any thing to a person's face!:)
1451695195|5.0|I am not quite finished with the book yet.  But it is very intriguing.  The one thing I wasn't so fond of was all the scientific terms that he used.  But, it is a very interesting subject.It was encouraging to view this subject from such an intelligent, accomplished person.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy this game very much. It has some classic arcade games which I have always enjoyed playing. Great job.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Beautifully narrated story of days long gone - told in a fluent today language. This is a classic and so it will stay. Highly recommended.
0316228532|2.0|The Casual Vacancy...what can I say...Ugh! First of all I will say that this book is not the genre' I like to read, i.e. Harry Potter. Having said that, it should not be compared to Rowling's Harry Potter series as it is NOT Fantasy fiction. What it is, however, is painful to read. To me, it was a pointless, somewhat boring, meandering book full of mean-spirited, unhappy, characters with few or no redeeming qualities. Wading through the characters' constant gratuitous spewing of profanity was an assault on the eyes. I blame the publisher's greed to capitalize on the Harry Potter success for this less than inspiring work by an excellent author. JK Rowling certainly deserved better from both her editors and her publisher.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This back pack is perfect for the money. I travel every week and I always have my gear. I haven't gone on a crazy overnight back packing adventure with it. If I did go some were off the map and overnight I would be carrying a real pack anyway with only two lenses.  It is what it is. It's not a pack to go out in the wilderness for three days because its not a big pack.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I found the writing style really distracting I found it kept me from connecting with the characters. If I knew it was about child abuse I never would have read it.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I found the accents, and the content, difficult to understand. Therefore the movie seemed boring. I'm sure that the charactters and the settings were great, and as close to History as could be. Unfortunately the last portion, about 5-10 minutes, I had some sort of problem. The movie froze. My controler had no control. Then went black. I guess when it came back on, that it picked up and finished.
B009ZOCLD6|5.0|Lisa Batiashvili plays with a musical devotion and concentrated energy that is special. I have been lucky enough to see her twice in concert, and I have been most impressed, especially this last time, seeing her play the Brahms Violin Concerto with the same orchestra featured here on this CD.    The Brahms Violin Concerto was conceived in a grand natural setting of mountains and lakes, at Pärtschach on Lake Worther in Carinthia. Apparently that place inspired the beautiful lyricism that runs throughout this work, that is contrasted very strikingly with rhythmic sections. Batiashvili plays her part with great precision and expression. The orchestra provides an energetic framework and although it is strong, it doesn't get in the way. The cadenza by Busoni is a departure from the usual. It has a stormy opening with a surprising timpani which contrasts with a very delicate lyricism that works well with the first movement's finale. The final movement - Hungarian, gypsy, dance-like, wherever it came from - is uplifting and wonderfully done, fast-paced and unusually dynamic with the bow.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Sure,fun game,but it would be fair if it was FREE! $3 was bad enough if you lost on tough rounds. I see tons of games ripping off people just for a shop to ACTUALLY pay. A game I recommend is Jetpack Joyride: You don't pay a lot just for buying for real. Trust me.
B00AZNSG0I|5.0|It's non stop action.  Poor Will learns his father is not who he thought he was and he learns who he is and what he is capable of to get his family back in 1 piece.  Set in and around various locations in Spain, but ends up in Madrid. Sigourney Weaver is awesome as the villainess in this movie....she is not her usual sweet self.
0792839749|4.0|This is a really great grandchild movie.  A fun story line and cute songs.  Dick Van Dyke is always enjoyable.<br />Flying cars seem to entertain kids and this movie did the job.
B009MF5BXK|3.0|Typical &#34;has been movie&#34;!  B movie at best!  It is somewhat entertaining when there's nothing else to watch on TV or on DVD!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great! It kept me interested constantly. I couldn't put it down. I just loved it! Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Season 1 builds the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson. The writing is superb. They treat each episode as if it were a movie....such attention to detail.  You often end up feeling like John does...what did I miss now?!
B005LAIIKI|2.0|Quentin Tarantino isn't for everyone.  My teenage granddaughter said I should watch this movie, but she watches zombie and slice and dice movies so I should have been forewarned.  Excellent cast and for anyone who likes this genre.  I'm sure it's a great movie, but not for me.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|bought this movie for grandkids and they just love it so was a positive buy on my part will be ordering more soon
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is very entertaining. You play it, then you can't put it down! The only thing I don't like is that the demand monkey is huge and when it's chasing you,  you can hardly see the screen!<br /><br />  But I love this game!
B008133MDK|5.0|I think this season is even better than Season 1. In this season you get to see a whole new side of Sherlock and you begin to not feel quite so dumb.  If you pay attention to Sherlock you can actually figure out what he's going to do, but not necessarily the how of what he is going to do.  My favorite episode would have to be A Scandal in Belgravia quickly followed by the season finale which is why I said I can't wait to see Season 3 and see if I'm right.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Strategy is everything in this game.  Do you choose slow but steady ronin?  Or the faster kunoichi? Either way  it is a fast paced and exciting game.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I always like books better than TV shows or movies and this one holds true. I love this series and find it very entertaining, but I wouldn't recomend it for someone who doesn't love to read. It's packed with details that don't always pertain to the plot that can make it seem slow at times. Other than that this book is fantastic.
B0091REZMW|5.0|If you play this game well, quickly, and correctly you are able to play with NO MONEY involved!  You are GIVEN coins in many different ways - you just need to earn them! If you want to play this and finish it in a 12 hour stretch (ugh) this isn't the game for you. Enjoy this game!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this whole series of books, each one I purchased I read from cover to cover as soon as I got it.  Christian Grey with all his quirks and hang-ups is an awesome hero and Ana, though I could shake her sometimes, is a feisty heroine and just what Christian needs.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|fun. exciting game. kills the battery on the kindle fire. just beat level 30 . only thing I hate is that everything makes so much time and effort.
B005V2S7FW|3.0|I have roboforms on my kindle fire not sure why amazon hide this app.  Go to roboforms website. Syncs across all my devices.  I have robo everywhere.
B005K01VZS|5.0|At first I didn't get it--the juxtaposition of stories about a Rabbi in New Jersey and a black minister at a homeless shelter/church in Detroit. I was moved by Henry's story but the Rabbi's, not so much. I almost stopped reading because I couldn't see where it was going. But I had a little faith...and stuck with it. In the end, I not only got it, I loved it. It taught me so much about commitments--the Rabbi's, Henry's and the author's--and how they give meaning to our lives but mainly it confirmed what I've always believed: a church is not in a building but rather in your heart.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this whole series, each book in the series is one you can't put down until you are finished with the book.  Read this, you won't be sorry.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun and interactive game with horses. I recommend it to you if you love horses and can't afford a real one. FUN.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|very cool upgrade kit, very cheap and effective for the money.  saves buying a new lite.  gives much more light and the button on off concersion is really cool too!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A great sound track, details of the basic games pre-interweb, with a splash of bbs. Well done. Where is the sequel?
B00BR4QNJ0|3.0|The game is fun, but, after a point it is impossible to progress without spending real money. Their is no real way to earn ingame coins other than the very occasional drop.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's good I guess could be more fun like rocket shoes! But cool I guess<br />This game can get a upgrade like rocket shoes or a hat that flat something cool really cool so that's really I ask all got to say but y'all makeing<br />Me write 20 words cool awesome fun viewing hate love death kill power God Inuit just be
B00123B9TU|5.0|I guess their genre, progressive rock, says it all. Because it is nothing like their earlier music. I guess getting used to the progressive style will take some getting used to.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Thanks Amazon for posting this video.  I am realy enjoying watching it when I get a chance!!  Wonderful, engaging drama!
0812550706|5.0|Couched in an amazing science fiction setting, Ender's Game tells the story of a hyper-intelligent young strategist trained to be a space general. The world/setting is wonderfully conceived and engaging, and the ending will not necessarily be what one expects - it likely will be much better and more surprising. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Should be compulsory reading for all whether starting out in life or despairing at the course of one' life.  I will treasure and pass this story of endurance on to my grandchildren
B000ICXQOM|5.0|My son and I really loved this movie. This was his first horror/comedy, and he was loving it throughout it all.
B00AJLHULW|5.0|Great recording, especially love the organ!  Superb musicianship and song selections, as is always the case with Robben Ford.<br /><br />If you get too hung up on what something should sound like or what definition/genre/mold it should fit, you're going to miss out on some great music, including this disc.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|If peter Jackson didn't like how the Hobbit was written he should have made another movie. This did not follow the book.  Far to many salient points were purposley changed. The changes did not fit the story and much of the subtle depth of the story was lost. As i said if Peter Jackson didn't  like the story of  The Hobbit he should have made another movie. Follow the book ...that is what the world loves NOT  peter Jackson's version of the Tolkien classic. Not worth it. read the book!! or watch older cartoon versions of the story at least they don't rewrite it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much you suggest it to anyone.  Having trouble unlocking full game funny you would think they would want your money.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am loving all g5 .So happy with this game. Took me two days well worth the money I paid for it.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Great book, much easier for me to read in hard book form and not on Kindle. Forgot about this when I ordered more books on Kindle...Maybe it may just take time to get used to &#34;computerized reading.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the bomb. Its fun and entertaining.  Only thing I would change is the loading speed. This game rocks and I recommend it 2 everybody!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best temple RUN there is. Awesome graphics and my favorite is the train tunnel. Gotta get game.and tons of cool features.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My seven year old son loves this game!!!!  Finally off of Angry Birds and onto this game on his tablet.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The evolution of characters is very interesting, and the stories in individual episodes are frequently surprising and compelling. I'm sure there are many ways that the procedures used in this show are illegal or implausible, but it's good entertainment.
B0049J3QF4|1.0|I never thought i first need to screen this movie before showing it to my kids.<br />I don't understand why adult themes have to be put in - it ruins a perfectly wholesome kids movie!<br />if you want to emphasize the lesson of friendship and the importance of winning/or not winning- i recommend showing the movie &#34;Everyone's Hero&#34;.
B003E2UQMS|5.0|I really liked this book, though at first I was struggling to pay full attention (a little bit boring). But soon, I was caught in the story and characters, Pat and Tiffany, and even Pat's mom. As Pat's character developed further, I could feel for the guy and what he had gone through, the uncertainty of what's real or not and how the future will be. Overall, it's a great story about being imperfect and loving someone else's imperfections, as they complement you. I'd strongly advice for people to READ THE BOOK FIRST and then watch the movie. Hopefully you won't be too disappointed by how Hollywood ruined the story, as I was.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I LOVED THE BOOK WITH READING SIMPLICITY AND ADMIRE THE DEDICATION TO AMERICAN HERO WHO UNFORTUNATELY WAS GUN DOWN FOR NO REASON AT ALL
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great weather app! it gives you all the information that you would want from a weather app! would recommend this to anyone
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|A Very cool and good game my son and I like it a lot and will give it ten stars!!!!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|ITS A GREAT BOOK ANYTHING BY mR. VINCE FLYNN IS PURE ENTERTAINMENT AND HOPEFULLY A NEW BOOK IS IN THE FUTURE
030758836X|1.0|The characters never became real. Although they were both rather awful people you never liked or disliked them.<br />The plot was weak and the whole book just rambled on without any suspense or drama. The author never got to a point and then suddenly decided she better end the book, so just created a really bizarre ending..<br />I would definitely not recommend the book to anybody.
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|The title really says all I have to offer. 50 years of collecting, 6 complete cycles and dozens of individual performances, I gave little thought to doing another collection. But the praise for Bertini made me curious.<br /><br />Can't thank everyone enough for this. Wonderful symphonies. Great clarity and new perspective from some of the voices he draws out of the orchestra. My Gawd, the Crescendi!!!  Berstein loses from the dated recordings and the unconstrained fury of his onslaughts. Bertini's finales in the 2d and 8th are Supernovas! Absolutely beatific.<br /><br />One disappointment. Das Lied. Not happy with the soloists. Even then Bertini milks the piece to make it sound more oriental than I have ever heard another conducter attempt. Still impressive.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I am reading this on my Kindle and there is a very BIG problem!!!! I will go to the next page and it's all crazy symbols like Chinese or something, then the next page is fine again. Some pages even have normal English writing as the headings, and then under the headings, it's all Chinese again!!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another good baldacchino book.  believable  characters that draw you in.  Robbie reminds me of a Jason Bourne type.  Would recommend
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I love playing games like this. I would like to see more of these games. keep up the good work.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Good progression of difficulty. In general this game mostly stresses logic but sometimes the timing plays a bigger role than I like and I needed multiple tries to get right.I really enjoy this game and its challenges and keep coming back to solve a few more levels...
B005HS00XW|2.0|I love edgy Peter Gabriel, but what I got in this concert was sappy symphony that seemed a mockery of Peter Gabrial. If you like Peter Gabrial music get \\"Secret World\\" and see him in his prime. If you like symphony... well, this does have impressive sound and video production. Sleep well.
B00942X8PY|4.0|This is a great game to sink some time in. I prefer the &#34;Zen&#34; mode where the level is not timed and I don't get stressed by the (too aggressive for my taste) timer of theother mode.<br />The graphics are simple but the focus is on the puzzles and not any story around it.<br />I keep coming back to the game to solve a few levels at a time.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love going on and downloading music and it can go right to your device or cloud and then I don't have tto buy my music love it use it everyday !!!
B007VUCAVO|3.0|Seems to work fine. Not bad for reference to your battery life. I use it often when the battery on my hd seems low and i want to see how much time us left before it shuts down while i am in the middle of anything
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Love it. Gave me a whole new perspective on life....would highly recommend it to EVERYONE! It reinforces love, tolerance, acceptance, and forgiveness, all the tools for happiness!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Life of Pi is a great story.  Best is that no blood, guts & gore were shown!!  That was left to one's imagination.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I enjoy the original NCIS, I have them all. My kids enjoy them also. From the 1st episode in season one to the most recent season ten final episode I remain a fan.
B002POMHVE|4.0|my daughter really enjoys Selena, so I purchased this album for her. I was really surprised and happy to hear most of the songs had left the \\"pop\\" sound behind. This album is much grittier along the lines of Avril Levigne and Alanis Morisette. I am really enjoying this album and so is my daughter!
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|They hyped it up nicely, and I was expecting something similar to vintage Bowie. I find it just ok. To my ears, it isn't as musical as older music from him, and the parts that the TIME writer liked didn't do much for me. Just my opinion.
B0058YPL66|5.0|When I first heard about this series, I thought it sounded hokey. Then the first season became available on Netflix, so I decided to watch the pilot just for fun because some girls at work had been raving about it. I was hooked in the first five minutes. This series is fantastically written, nicely acted, and the interwoven and continuing storylines are addicting. I really must return to my life, but I must watch this!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty cool. I have a horse too, it's a lot easier to take care of on here. I wish you could create your own.
0307352153|5.0|Fantastic read. I am an introvert that had learned to extrovert over the years working in retail. However, I still need my alone time, and prefer to be singular. However, I never truly understood the world of introverts until I read this amazing work. Fantastic.
B00190N4E4|5.0|It's long but definitely captures a lot of India's history. For as old as this movie is, it's still a great movie to watch today.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|I think it's a really good app because  I love yo draw sketch whatever<br />I really think you should have this app
B009K0P10K|5.0|I will admit that Season 2 wasn't as exciting as Season 1, but it was still good enough that I purchased all episodes. I love to see what the characters will wear and what juicy new secret will emerge next.
B008MM9630|5.0|I have enjoyed this, especially since you don't have to have others send you things to move on, although friends would certainly help.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBULM! I LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME. COLDPLAY DID A EXCELLANT JOB ON ALL THE SONGS. . . .
B001PP9ALY|2.0|This could be a smart film with a decent plot and a message.  Or at least not an ongoing headache... Lots of glamorizing of criminality and gratuitous graphic violence.
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|But not near as good as House of Gold and Bones pt 1, witch in my opinion is the best Stonesour album (cd) ever
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Since I was little Rocky Horror has always been absolute pleasure and it only keeps getting better and better!!! I love it!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Really like the app and how it is layed out. Everything you need to check is right there on your home page and easy to locate- items you are bidding on, watching, lost, etc. Two thumbs up!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It was an enjoyable read. Our book club loved it. This book shows the warm family relationships of a family in slavery. I  did'nt want to stop reading!
B005OLF6BI|5.0|I'm a 52 year old male that only listens to Rock(mainly classic), and Taylor. This is the most amazing concert DVD I've seen. The passion Taylor puts into her live performances in unrivaled.<br />If you're thinking about buying this do it. You won't regret it.<br />I watch it at least once a week and it was well worth the low cost.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|The Apartment(released June/60)stars,among others,Jack Lemmon as C.C.Baxter,Shirley MacLaine as Fran Kubelik,Fred MacMurray as Jeff D. Sheldrake,Ray Walston as Joe Dobisch and Jack Kruschen as Dr. Dreyfuss.These oldies but goodies don't cross my desk too much anymore(the shame),but when they do I dive in for all it's worth.This\\"oldie but goodie\\" was nominated for five OSCARS and caught two for best picture and best director.And director Wilder is in top form here throughout,as is his two main stars MacLaine and Lemmon.<br />The story finds Lemmon working as an accounting clerk in a high rise New York City office building.Lemmon is your everyman,working  nine to five,or in this case 8:50 to 4:20.Lemmon is the go-to guy for four of his bosses who have regular on-going trysts.That is,when the bosses need some alone time with their women,Lemmon,a bachelor himself,loans out his place to whoever asks first.It is a long standing thing with Lemmon going back before he even joined the company.It is not above the pale for his temporary guests to ask for a stocked liquor cabinet and food,when needed.Lemmon has even gone so far as to cover up these trysts at his place to his fellow tenants and landlady.Lemmon makes it seem like HE is the Casanova to end all Casanova's.<br />Now Lemmon may be a soft touch,but he has hopes his\\"generosity\\" with his bosses will someday be rewarded.And that day eventually comes.His four bosses` recommendations get the attention of the big boss,played by Fred MacMurray.Now Fred isn't a slouch either,and he knows what is behind all those glowing recommendations by Lemmon's bosses.Just when Lemmon thinks he is in for that promotion,Fred throws Lemmon a curve.If Lemmon plays ball with him he will get that promotion.All Lemmon has to do is let Fred use his apartment from time to time.Ever faithful and discreet,Lemmon of course goes along with the big boss.<br />As all these events have progressed we have been privy to Lemmon's crush for MacLaine who operates one of the elevators.Fred asks Lemmon for his apartment key for a particular night so he may bring his girlfriend there,in exchange he has given Lemmon two tickets for the Music Man on Brodway.Lemmon of course asks MacLaine to join him,who says she will meet him there at 8:30.The night goes on and Lemmon is still standing outside the theater as the play begins....stood up.Next day Lemmon returns a compact back to Fred telling him the mirror is cracked inside,and it wasn't his fault.<br />Xmas eve comes and Lemmon is at work enjoying the office party.He and MacLaine are in his office and when Lemmon asks MacLaine how his new derby looks on him,she hands him her compact.When he opens it up he sees the broken mirror and realizes who Fred's girlfriend is.Lemmon is crushed,but says nothing.<br />Later that night Fred and MacLaine are at Lemmons apartment and MacLaine is upset at some facts about Fred she heard from his secretary about the number of women he has had.Fred leaves and MacLaine stays behind,and tries to commit suicide with some sleeping pills she finds in Lemmon's bathroom cabinet.Lemmon arrives home with someone he has picked up at the bar but finds MacLaine prostrate on his bed.In short order he realizes what has happened,sends the girl from the bar packing and gets the doctor from next door.It is a close call but MacLaine comes out of it.When MacLaine finally comes to enough to know where she is and whose apartment she is in she is mortified.Lemmon,like always,tries to make it look like this all happened because of him,with his fellow tenants and landlord and contacts his boss to get him to talk with MacLaine.<br />Two days later Fred is back at work and fires his secretary who tattled on him.And he calls in Lemmon who he promotes with an office right next door to his.Lemmon and Fred have a confrontation when Lemmon at first refuses any more use of his apartment.(He has truly fallen for MacLaine).Lemmon eventually caves when Fred makes it clear his job will be in jeopardy,but he has had enough and quits.On New Years eve Lemmon is at home packing up his things in his apartment as he plans to move,while MacLaine and Fred are out at a party.Fred`s ex secretary also tattled on his wife,and now Fred is staying at the `Y`.It is here,at midnight,that Maclaine finally comes to the realization that she is now in love with Lemmon.She rushes out and over to Lemmons apartment and the film fades as two happy people sit playing gin rummy as the new year rings in.<br />The movie has everything you could want,great direction,editing,acting,writing and a broad range of emotions covered throughout from comedy to pathos and everything in between.<br />Wilder starts the proceedings as if this was a comedy.Slowly but surely though we come to realize that Lemmon's loaning out of his apartment is going to have some unforeseen consequences.And eventually it does,but not quite in the way one would expect,and that's what is really fine about this film.The little almost puppy love thing between Lemmon and MacLaine is something to watch. Lemmon is giving out with all the doting,while little of it is returned in kind,as we come to find out MacLaine has someone else on the line;and of all people his own big boss.Then we see Lemmon`s heart literally crushed before our eyes when he realizes the compact belongs to MacLaine and who it is in her life.Does Lemmon become bitter at MacLaine??No,he becomes her white knight when she tries to kill herself and supports her all the way back to health,even covering up for her.MacLaine,who has complained she`s always fallen in love with the wrong men,much to our delight,finally realizes that her true love has been staring her in the face all this time.Wilder brings it all home and it leaves you with a warm feeling.Watch for Mrs.Ernie Kovacs,Edie Adams,playing MacMurray`s secretary.Funny,but when I first saw this film back in the day,I remember thinking,`God,does every executive in an office,and who are married,all have affairs like this??`.While the film certainly has that element in it,I`m a little older now(and maybe a little wiser...just a little)and realize there`s much more going on than just that.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is generally clear and crisp.This edition`s extras include two featurettes and commentary.<br />All in all a wonderful film directed by veteran Wilder.Everyone involved is on game here.A great movie with a great cast.Highly recommended.b will be in jeopardy,but he has had enough and quits.On New Years eve Lemmon is at home packing up his things in his apartment as he plans to move,while MacLaine and Fred are out at a party.Fred`s ex secretary also tattled on his wife,and now Fred is staying at the `Y`.It is here,at midnight,that Maclaine finally comes to the realization that she is now in love with Lemmon.She rushes out and over to Lemmons apartment and the film fades as two happy people sit playing gin rummy as the new year rings in.<br />The movie has everything you could want,great direction,editing,acting,writing and a broad range of emotions covered throughout from comedy to pathos and everything in between.<br />Wilder starts the proceedings as if this was a comedy.Slowly but surely though we come to realize that Lemmon's loaning out of his apartment is going to have some unforeseen consequences.And eventually it does,but not quite in the way one would expect,and that's what is really fine about this film.The little almost puppy love thing between Lemmon and MacLaine is something to watch.

B002NPUCRQ|5.0|I'm a 52 year old male that only listens to rock, and Taylor. Her music can't be defined as its not really pop, country, or rock. Its a new type of music, and one of the best albums I've ever heard.

B005DJREJS|5.0|This show was really cute and so entertaining.<br /><br />It's worth a shot to watch at least the first episode.<br /><br />I did, and I am hooked!
B00BAVCD8A|2.0|As a longtime Fall Out Boy fan, I awaited eagerly for the band to come forth with a new album. Unfortunately, I am unsatisfied with the album they did come out with. While I would say there are some songs I truly enjoy, like the ever enjoyable song \\"The Phoenix\\" to the slower and rhythmic title song \\"save rock and roll\\" there are a lot of blemishes on the album. \\"Alone Together\\" sounds a lot like any other overproduced pop anthem, with generic lyrics and a generic catchy beat. Songs like \\"Where Did The Party Go\\" and \\"Just One Yesterday\\" are mostly forgettable; I found myself skipping these songs often. \\"The Mighty Fall\\" started to sound like a good song, and I loved every moment of the song until Big Sean appeared; but his mostly irrelevant lyrics not only ruin the song, but also bring unnecessary vulgarity to the song. Honestly, this album sounds like a producer had all the control rather than Fall Out Boy having any control. I just hope that Fall Out Boy will push out another album in a few years that has a few more solid songs. So in my humble opinion...<br />Good songs: The Phoenix, Death Valley, and Save Rock and Roll.<br />Decent songs: My Songs Know, Just One Yesterday, Rat A Tat.<br />Bad songs: Alone Together, Where Did The Party Go, The Mighty Fall.<br />The rest of the songs I don't have too solid opinion on. I would give the album two out of five stars, I hope this helps you if you took the time to read this.
B0089LOKHG|1.0|I didn't like this series at all. But this book was the worst one. Couldn't wait for it to be over

B005S9EKCW|1.0|I have been a fan of the stage version of Les Misérables for more than 20 years, so I was really excited when I heard it was going to be made into a movie.  I finally sat down to watch the film this weekend and I have to say I have never been so disappointed by a movie in my life.  I barely made it through watching the whole movie, it felt like it went on forever probably because the few songs that are meant to be uptempo were played more like a funeral dirge that bogged down the entire film.  There were scenes and songs taken out of order leaving huge plot holes that were never filled, and moments of musical disharmony that made my ears hurt.<br /><br />If you really want to experience Les Misérables watch the 10th anniversary concert version, not this melodramatic, boring movie.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I think that scenically this movie is VERY Wondrous and Fantastic.  The many and various space cities and the space vehicles and the Space itself are just fabulous.  (The vroom-vroom music and sound effects are not, though.  I had to keep turning down the loud Speeding-and-Warring noisy-type music, and then I would miss what the characters said when they began to speak again.)<br /><br />(And the races and battle scenes seemed too long and drawn out.)<br /><br />I wasn't very fond of the great multitude of peculiar fantasy creatures.  I grew weary with the weird and comic quality of so many peculiar creatures as denizens of outer space.  Became surfeited with them and the fascinating other worlds after awhile.  The movie might have benefited from being just a bit shorter.<br /><br />On the other hand, I did enjoy all the robots very much--the way they were so much like real people.  Who cannot love R2D2, and the English-speaking, polite, butler-like robots like C3P02?  Even the evil robot warriers and the very tiny, evil, servant robots were very intriguing in their lifelikeness.  A lot of these fascinating robot characters, you have to look quick to catch a glimpse of them.  So much is going on in some of these scenes.<br /><br />Overall, creatively, this is a fabulous, sensational production.  All the scenes have an awesome vastness and are beautiful compositions.  Some of the costumes are interesting artistically.<br /><br />There are shades of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" in this movie.  Going into the big battle scene seemed copied right from it.  If you like the fantasy in LOTR, you can probably like it here (only there is a LOT more of it here).  And comparable to the DIGNITY of Aragorn/Stryder in LOTR, is the Jedi warrior played by Liam Neeson here.  I really LIKE him!  I think the character played by Neeson is fine and very sympathetic.  I couldn't believe that he died in the story!  No, no, to that; I wanted to see more of such an excellent character, good father-figure to young Anakin (who turns out unexpectedly to be a Christ-figure, for Heaven's sake!!)<br /><br />The Jedi reminded me of an order of priests with their great tradition and dignity.  In this story, there is a prophecy that the son of a virgin will restore balance to the ? society, or something like that.  I missed so much of the dialogue, I hardly know any details of the story.  Anyway, I really, really liked Anakin, too, the little boy who is the young Christ figure.  He will become Luke Skywalker in later episodes.<br /><br />This is a movie that will appeal to young kids and adults too.  (I mean it appealed to me, and I am an adult who is kidlike.)  And just looking at it without understanding the words that occur in the plot, a young person will understand which characters are clearly Good and which characters are clearly Evil--and they will wonder about the ones in-between that seem indecipherable.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot that is good about the movie.  But when I read a few of the 1-star reviews, I was able to both agree and disagree with the criticisms.  Overall, I am giving this episode a high rating because I thought the artistry was fabulous and the good Jedi characters were a very positive feature.  As far as I can tell, even though it tends toward some odd theological concepts, it could very well be a movie that instills just the usual age-old respect for Good triumphant over Evil.  (I haven't heard what church people say about the Star Wars Trilogy.)<br /><br />Well, I think it is indisputably a FANTASTIC movie, in the full sense of the meaning of the word.
B00B671W6W|5.0|Anthems is amazing!  Such great covers, and Crawl was my favorite song on Worship Music, so to have that &#34;reworked&#34; was great.  Thanks Scotty, Charlie, Rob, Frankie and Joey!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game has had me playing forever when I'm bored or just want to have fun GREAT GAME totally download;)
B0050PYNP8|1.0|The story is great and I was enjoying it until we got to the trailer park scene where the obviously atheist writers threw in a very unnecessary and objectionable twist.  They portray the girl and her father as lunatic Christians and make statements about evolution and science in general meant to ridicule Christianity in a very sarcastic tone--no humor about it.  Completely unnecessary commentary that ruined the movie.  If similar jabs were made at other religions, people would be up in arms, but since they were only ridiculing evangelical Christians, it seems that everybody is okay with it.  I threw the DVD in the trash.
0307887960|5.0|it is written in detail that I can follow.  I am 77 yrs old and have lost wt.  although it is much slower.  I am getting tired of the milk products as I still have lactose allergies.  Losing my voice, ,making it unable for me to sing or read out loud for any length of time.  I love the Oat Bran (pancake)  I use coconut extract to seasoning.  Remember tho&#34; that it is important to let the mix sit at least 1/2 hr-1hr before frying to have a thicker texture to prevent running pancake and making turning with ease.  My biggest problem is constipation. The Oat Bran doesn't help me.  I also drink 10 glasses water each day.  I have had to use Cascara Sagrada each nite.<br />  Thanks, shirlene
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|This movie is raw and very well done, although I wonder how realistic about the one element of inverted to upright flying. That said, Denzel does an excellent job of playing flawed characters. John Goodman is terrific! Probably his best role ever in a movie! I stayed on the edge of my seat and for once I actually felt this movie draw me in deeper than just the casual movie viewer.
0765325950|4.0|It wrapped up the series adequately.  I feel that Jordan would have done it better but it is always difficult finishing a series posthumously.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Based on a true story set during the hostage crisis, six workers in the American Embassy manage to escape the takeover and take shelter with the Canadians, the only ones who would shelter them. the problem is, they can't stay long, and the Iranians are hunting everywhere for them. Tony Mendez is a CIA agent chosen to get them out any way he can, but to do that, he needs a plan, a good one, since the job seems almost impossible. While watching television,the plan comes to him, one that is both audacious and bold, one worthy of Hollywood, and so &#34;Argo&#34; is born. Disguised as a film crew, he finally leads the six through the streets of Teheran and finally to the airport, but it is a race both against time and the Iranians, who have pieced together who was missing from the Embassy and are hot on their trail, so hot, in fact, that they are literally trying to chase down the plane as it is taxiing down the runway. It is literally a nail biter to the end. An excellent story with a good bit of history.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is the best game ever they need to keep it coming though because i play it every day<br />Great
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Has a way of not doing the expected. Young Merida is the headstrong daughter of the feisty Scottish King Fergus and the equally strong but more quiet Queen Elinor, and loves both with all her heart, but as a princess, finds her duties to be a royal pain in the tush. Elinor is grooming her to royal duties, but Merida sees the inequality of her life as she has three smaller brothers who can almost get away with anything and are not facing the duties she must. In what little time she has to herself. she can be found outside the castle walls, riding her horse and practicing her archery, her favorite hobby. It is when she discovers she has been, literally put up for betrothal to the winner in a contest between three clans that the war with her mother actually begins as she has no desire to be married at all unless she can choose for herself, and none of the three clans offer much hope for a good match. Merida then takes matters into her own hands when she enters the contest to win her own hand sparking a raging argument with her mother which sees her flying off alone in tears. Willo the wisps enter the picture to lead her to an old witch's cottage where she pays the witch to cast a spell to change her fate. It changes more than that. It turns her mother into a bear and binds both her and her mother to an older fate when she finds she must not only seek a way to change her mother back, but protect her from her father who is seeking to kill what he believes is a legendary monster. Worse, both must contend with the monster, who is not only legendary, but alive. Merida must fight her father while Elinor takes on the powerful creature to save her daughter. How does it end? You'll have to see. I love this because it doesn't fall into the usual fairytale rule of Prince marrying the princess and living happily ever after. This is a tale of a headstrong powerful girl changing her fate and herself, seeking more from life than to be a prize for a contest and the dutiful quiet wifeof a winner she doesn't even know. She is seeking the freedom to choose for herself what she wants and must be brave to not only find what she wants, but to correct her mistakes and protect her family as well as she might. This is an odd tale, but a great one!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Had some fantastic imagery. Can't wait till house of Hades comes out I hope that it's going to keep me on my feet.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I had already heard the controversy from the die-hards but decided to give this movie a chance. Dorothy is a changed girl from the last time she visited Oz and the fact that she is being subconsciously called back makes it hard for her Aunt and Uncle, who don't understand her dreams and her obsession with the mythical land she claims to have visited. While her uncle finishes the house that had been taken by the tornado the last time, Aunt Em takes Dorothy to the big city, where a Doctor is using a controversial new shock therapy treatment to remove bad memories. Just before she undergoes it a storm knocks out the power and Dorothy, realizing she is in some kind of danger makes her escape into it and falls into a flood. Clutching onto a box, her only companion a chicken, named Henrietta, her pet from the farm, the flood transports her back to Oz, where she discovers things have changed, and not for the better. The Tin man, the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow have been, like all the inhabitants, changed to stone and the creepy Wheelies are roaming the streets as guards, under the command of a witch named Mombie who also holds captive the true ruler of Oz, Princess Ozma in her magic mirror. The witch however, is the accomplice of a more powerful being, The Gnome King who seeks the one magical item in Dorothy's possession, the Ruby Slippers in order to complete his hold upon Oz forever. To free Oz, she must get a key kept by the witch, find a magical powder and somehow get across the Deadly Desert. She dosen't do it alone. In a chamber, she finds Tic Tok, the Army of Oz, a wind up soldier, makes a creature named Jack Pumpkinhead and with two couches and a stuffed animal head creates Gump, a flying construct. Once she reaches the Gnome King's palace, she is taken captive and forced to play a deadly guessing game to find her captive friends, break the Gnome King's terrible power and free both Ozma from her prison and the land of Oz from the spell. This tale is much darker and highlights the fact that fairytales are not always pleasant. While the 1939 movie touched on the darkness it was made in a time where people were looking for brighter hopes and unpleasantness was downplayed. While this fairytale had a happy ending, the darkness was stronger here. Yes, this was not a Judy Garland tale, but Fairuza Balk was a good Dorothy, the Gnome King was a credible villain and Mombi was beautiful and decidedly creepy with her head collection, taken from the various inhabitants of Oz, interchanging them with her own as one would put on or take off a coat or a hat. It is Henrietta however, who ends the Gnome King's power, by laying her last egg,which poisons the King when he accidentally swallows it during the rage he has when Dorothy defeats his game and finds her friends and the imprisoned Scarecrow in the treasure room. Dorothy manages to return home to find everything is changed,for the better this time. The Doctor and his assistants arrested as dangerous quacks and Dorothy's dreams have been allayed. True, not your typical fairy tale but intriguing in its own right. I still say, give it a chance.and highlights the fact that fairytales are not always pleasant.

B003GAFA8S|3.0|This movie was mildly entertaining.  It was one more movie that I realize was more entertaining for its time than it is now.  Worth watching, but not extremely fun.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Lord of the Rings was a great trilogy and it had amazing visuals.. the hobbit however lacked evolution of enhanced visuals and further more has the audacity to think it can be split up into several movies. This movie does not deserve to have a sequel or trilogy like Lord of the Rings. The CG looks terribly fake in many parts of the film almost reminiscent of the movie 300.. Its worth the rent if you are up for sitting through several hours of brain dead orc fighting to only discover that nothing about the movie ever leaves you feeling your time was well spent.

B000S1M9LY|3.0|I had to skim through this book since i try to finish every book i read. This one was a bit heavy going. I think some books will stay with you and affect you on some level but this book doesn't resonate with me, like a person speaking to you but you have nothing in common, or you have different personalities.

She can play with it like it's a house, have the barbies swim in the pool (the lid,) and then clean up super fast and store away.  It's perfect!
1451696191|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time! Such a good way to describe the troubles and worries of a modern teenager. Can't say I liked the movie all that much, but that's just me. Couldn't think of a better book to pick up and read. Overall, it's The Catcher in the Rye for 90s kids. Buy this book!
B005HJWWW8|3.0|Works well for standard headphone speakers.  I purchased the E6 to go with my helmet speakers while riding my motorcycle.  The amplifier does increase the volume but not enough that doubles the sound.  I purchased the E11 and that works perfectly for what I need.  Gave the E6 to my friend and he loves it using in ear headphones on his bike.<br />If you will be using this to amply your headphones for the gym or while riding the E6 will make you happy.

B00BVYLBP2|4.0|I've only seen the first three episodes, but want to put this out there for anyone on the fence about watching this show. Anyone contemplating starting the series probably knows the cloning plot so I'm not going to get into that. I will say that this is my new most favorite show. Each episode ends on a cliff hanger so you can't wait for the next show (kinda like what 24 Hours use to do). The characters are memorable and while Tatiana's character lacks morals, she is still likeable. I found myself liking this show right from the pilot, which doesn't happen very often. Usually, I need several shows to decide if I like it or not.  I have no regrets ordering the season of this show and highly recommend it for anyone debating pressing the buy it now button.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I really  enjoyed this movie. Fantastic actors and I enjoyed the singing.I thought it was one of the best movies I have seen in quite a while.
B00008PX8P|5.0|The second cd (2 CD pack)had all of the live performances I was looking for and it can't be beat. If you are a Led Zeppelin fan it is a must have.<br />Second thing,<br />I was duped into buying another CD called &#34;LED ZEPPELIN 1975 THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY&#34;. IT IS A PIECE OF CRAP IN MY OPINION. I looked at the cover and it is from a performance at EARLS COURT i believe. Then if you read the back it said one of the best documentaries yet to be produced. It is in my opinion decietful in its wording.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is highly addictive and easy to pick up where you left off when you have to put it down..
B009NYF2GQ|4.0|the cast is incredible, and expertly directed.  the extras are very interesting, especially commentary by the stars.<br />way ahead of it's time.
B006M4F67A|5.0|The Amazon 247 Mahjong is the best functioning mahjong game I have encountered so far.  It hasn't had any malfunctions or glitches since I started using it.  It's the best one!  Plus I like the swimming fish.
B007712XAU|4.0|this is a great way to watch this excellent drama ...no commercial or pledge breaks as pbs likes to call them. and the<br />extras are also interesting.
B00942G4UA|4.0|This film is eye opening. I wish everybody would watch it. We, the little people, do have influence and can affect the food inductry, but we would all have to stick together. Money talks and it seems that's all that the government and big business care about. Watch and make up your own mind! This movie is well done.<br /><br />I love Amazon Prime and the streaming experience. Amazon has a lot of movies and tv shows that their competitors don't have.
B000SGRONM|1.0|Read it all hoping something worth my time was in there somewhere.<br />Noooooo?<br />Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|I got it as a freebie and before anyone had reviewed it. It's much better than other bowling games I've played. There is a menu, it's in the top left hand corner so I don't get why people are saying there isn't one. I manage to get high scores so again I don't get why people are saying it's impossible not to beat the weird ghostly sliding opponents - I have to agree they are really weird!!!<br /><br />My only problem with it is that it keeps making my other apps stop working properly. Although the sound is audible while playing this game, if I switch to another app there is no sound and there is no sound if I then start playing my music.<br /><br />For that reason alone it would get a minus 1 star if that was possible.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is easy to get,easy to play, and easy to everything but put down...  thank goodness there is something you can just pick up and play...  I love it
B007BT0RKG|2.0|Disappointed with this app as I've found that trying to locate places is a time-consuming ordeal. This is the freebie version and it does state that there isn't a \\"look-up location finder\\" so maybe the paid for version would have suited me better. I can find my own road but unless you know a lot about the local roads you're looking for in an area then it's a very long hit and miss process. As I say, they do pre-warn you that there's no look-up feature so as long as you know what you're looking for you'll be ok.
B000059QYB|5.0|I love this CD, I bought it for a friend as I already own it. I exercise to it and it just lifts your spirits and makes you want to dance. So, if you want to feel happy, turn it on and sing.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I usually use the calculator on my mobile which is a bit fiddly so this app is great on my kindle fire HD as it fills the screen in portrait mode so the buttons are huge as you can imagine which is especially great if you have long nails as you can't hit the wrong buttons by accident - yep I know that's a girl-thing but it's important isn't it ladies??!!! Anyway it does everything I want it to and is much easier than using a regular calculator so a big thumbs-up from me for ease of use!
B005KWL2IW|5.0|I used to be a huge Anthrax fan; I had a vanity license plate and everything.  When John Bush came in to replace Joey Belladonna, they improbably got even better.  Sound of White Noise was a masterwork, and Stomp 442 was great, too, but the next couple of records left me cold.  I think I moved on to other styles of music, but I just discovered this triumphant return of Joey Belladonna a couple of days ago, and I have to say, whatever bad feelings and misunderstandings and poor timing had to happen to ultimately result in this piece of work, IT WAS ALL WORTH IT.  If you were ever a fan of the late, more mature albums like State of Euphoria and Persistence of Time, just buy this one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Downloaded this & haven't stopped playing it !!!  Love the App, don't like having to wait 20 seconds for the next coin to be available but that's because I'm impatient & want to play continuously without interruption!! Only thing I find annoying are the Oooooos & ahhhhhs when prizes fall down the side gutters or a prize drops on the coins, they sound kinda creepy and although I know I can turn the sound off I like hearing the coins drop, so apart from the weird church choir like sounds, it's a great, very addictive app.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I swear I kept waiting for the author to have Travis say, \\"Heeeeyyy\\" like Fonzie did!!  Lots of teenage angst and many unbelievable moments, but it's still a sweet read, regardless of your age.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|This was great initially until it told me to install an update but each time I try it says update fail .... Now it won't work at all. Not happy.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Daft Punk is back on the EDM scene with this new single.  The funky bass lines and vocals make this a track which is tough not to include on every playlist.  Another interesting thing to note is that all of the vocals and instrumentals were not fabricated on a computer.  Looking forward to Random Access Memories on May 21.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Ok I admit it I'm a facebook addict & feel like my arm's been chopped off if I can't get on there everyday.<br /><br />I downloaded the app on my new Kindle Fire HD & while it's not the same experience as accessing facebook from my laptop because of it's limitations such as not having flash on the Kindle so I can't play any games, it still allows me to keep in daily contact with my family (who live abroad) & my friends and see their photos, status updates, comments etc & update my own status, comment on posts just like regular facebook.<br /><br />Initially I was pretty disappointed but I'd not used a tablet to access facebook before so I was expecting it to be the same as on my laptop. After I got over my initial disappointment I've got used to it and now like it.<br /><br />My advice would be that if you're expecting the facebook app to be the same experience as regular facebook you'll be disappointed, but if you accept it for what it is with it's limitations you'll grow to like it.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Title says it all! Wish there was a way to get help with this as my kids want to play it.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I tend to use facebook more than twitter but I do enjoy twitter too. I downloaded the apps for both facebook and twitter on my new Kindle Fire HD (see my separate review for the facebook app) and I find the twitter app virtually the same as accessing twitter on my laptop. The only thing I find annoying is that I can't suss out how to log out. Logging in is easy, tweeting is easy, re-tweeting is easy, but logging out? Nope can't suss that bit so if anyone can tell me how please feel free to comment on my review.
B000SW2F80|5.0|Obviously, I grew up watching this. Got 1 and 2 with my new VCR for my 5th birthday. Anyone trying to watch this now will probably hate it, and I understand that. But it is certainly a classic for the 25 and up crowd.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Was a bit apprehensive of downloading this but it's fine. Ok it's not exactly the same as the usual online version but pretty much as close as you can get so it's great for placing bids, checking on your bids, searching for items etc etc anything you usually do on ebay. Can't say what it's like for selling items as I've not used ebay for selling anything, I tend to just buy and for that it certainly suits my purposes.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Loved the way they tied in so many old Bond movies to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Bond. A must see for Bond fans!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Absolutely love this app, can't praise it highly enough. You can mix an amazing number of relaxation sounds to customise them to your mood and how you're feeling. They range from tribal drums to flutes, guitars, ocean waves, thunder, Whales, city sounds, cats purring, piano music, Zen, birds, rain, frogs, streams, white noise, in fact almost anything you can think of. Have had great fun creating my own personalised relaxation music and playing it on loop so it's in the background while I'm working on my laptop doing my daily occupation which is mostly stressful. Thoroughly recommend it and worthy of the 5 stars.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Gladwell poses some interesting observations on successful people and what contributes to their success. Basically he says practiced skills, environment and timing are the common denominators. Being born in January, I was unlucky not to be Canadian.Read the book to understand why.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I play this on facebook & wasn't expecting it to be so good on my Kindle Fire HD but it's even better .... the graphics are amazing !!! Definitely worth downloading, thoroughly recommend it.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|I found it to be a bit boring until the very end.<br />As well, the &#34;swimming&#34; movement of the water and animals<br />made my eyes go crazy.
B004FOOQV6|1.0|Don't like this at all. I thought it was meant to make calculating things easy but either I'm incredibly thick - hence downloading the App to make my life easier - or the App is great and I'm just not \\"getting it\\" but either way it's going in the recycle bin. Sorry Devs I need an idiot proof version or more detailed instructions on how to use it.
0345529057|5.0|The books are way better than the series, so much detail! I am already on book four and havent had these books long!  If you like the series this set is for you!
076790592X|5.0|This was one of the most moving yet inspiring books I have ever read. Although sad, it also had many amusing lines which also helps to captivate the reader. I would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the importance of friendship, family, love and support, and in some ways is searching for answers to the meaning of life.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Do not like new version.  Screen is too cluttered.  Liked the older, simpler one much better.  Do not know why they changed it.  Would not have updated had I known what it would be like.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|Ever since the release of this film I've been preparing to write a reflection on the impact of the events depicted. Thank you for having it in your product line.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Once I started watching Downton Abbey I could see why it is so popular.  The scenery is exquisite and the history of  World War I Europe is very accurate.  I love the characters and the  lifestyle of this period is most interesting. The women's costumes are beautiful, I can't imagine the work that went into reproducing them.  There is just  enough English humor to provide a few laughs in each episode.  I look forward to viewing season 3.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Lots of options and strategy to consider. Contrary to others reviews, do not have to buy coins to beat game. Best game I have on Kindle
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This item was a great addition to my Nikon collection.  It is a must have for doing indoor photography! Def recommend
B004C03TJ8|5.0|always loved this when my kids were little, now this one is for my Grandson.... he's a Mikey Mouse lover, and now we'll add music appreciation to his interests... he's gonna love it
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I think that as long people don't give their whole life  on [[ASIN:B0094BB4TW Facebook]][[ASIN:B0094BB4TW Facebook]]then it is good.  I like that I can stop all the requests from others playing games.<br />  I wish parents watched what the kids under 13 are doing on Facebook..
B0018D4SHY|4.0|How can you not love Little Richard, one of the early founders of Rock and Roll! You just have to smile and get up and dance!<br /><br />Each song sort of went into the next.  I don't think this was actually separate recordings.  The only way I can describe it would be as if whoever compiled this did it from a 33 1/3 record and lifted the needle before the end of one song, then put it down near the beginning of the next song. That doesn't bother me - &#34;it is what it is&#34;, but if you want pristine versions of each song this is not the CD for you.
B005L38QHA|4.0|Love the extra buttons and their placement.<br /><br />One downside is the mouse feels cheap and looks dirty quickly.  Probably shouldn't have gone with the glossy finish when they made it.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I happened to see this on PBS and had to have it!  Muddy Waters and the Rolling Stones who just &#34;dropped in&#34; to the club unannounced.  The only thing I can say is I wish I had been there!!!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book was well written, it was an easy read and it was engaging. The book really hits home with parents who have to look at their children's behaviors and not hide from reality. The book also had nice twist which was unexpected and added to the enjoyment of the book. m
B001AITGWE|5.0|This movie is a great statement on our society today! Michael Douglas was excellent! Although the movie takes a dark turn as it progresses, you can't help but cheer him on through his early escapades.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|My wife just finished The Fall of Giants and loved it.  I am only about 20% into it and already thinks it's wonderful. We are both looking forward to Winter of the World.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Channing Tatum is cute in this. All if the guys are! The plot is weak but, the dancers are entertaining.
1401937519|5.0|I am almost done reading it and am truly inspired.  This lady seems to have a wonderful family. Thank you for coming back to help us Anita!!!!
0763644765|5.0|Got this for my nephew's second birthday. It was instantly his favorite book. He can &#34;read&#34; the whole thing by himself, and &#34;Tinkle tinkle toot&#34; is his favorite joke. He is eager to sit on his potty now on his own. Indispensable for any parent.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What an incredible series !  I pu this right in front of Call the Midwife. The depth of the plot and subplots is rich and full. It brings the two worlds of service and gentry together seamlessly. I have always been for the underdog or the poorer one but this makes me realize that everyone has their own set of joys and problems. This whole story helped me think and feel more deeply.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can increase the font size, which makes reading much easier.  Plus you can automatically pick up where you left off in your reading.  The best part of all...It's absolutely FREE!
B0008KLVG4|5.0|On one hand, I love this movie as high adventure/suspense thriller.  On the other hand, I blame this movie for inspiring so many crappy rip-offs.<br />No matter how many times I watch this movie, I am still riveted by the opening sequence.  The casting is sheer perfection (especially Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper).  The dialog is priceless (\\"I hate the water.\\"  \\"I can't imagine why.\\").  The music is beyond perfection (I put it up there with Bernard Herrmann's score for Psycho).  The story is simple and to the point.  Fake shark and all, this is one fantastic movie.  No film library would be complete without this entry front and center.  People who haven't seen this movie are doing themselves a disservice.
B002TZ3DYY|5.0|I've read several of the series and found &#34;Tears of the Giraffe&#34; one of the most enjoyable. It has a reflective quality I particularly like. The author tends to repeat himself a lot which can be a tiny bit irritating over time, useful from book to book but less so within a story, but nonetheless I confess I'm addicted. I'd recommend it to anyone, particularly those wanting a soothing bedtime read.
B00026WU7I|5.0|Dylan is a legend--even though he doesn't consider himself one.  He's influenced so many artists to sing from their hearts and not listen to the critics.  One case in point is on the length of a song.  &#34;Like a Rolling Stone&#34; certainly exceeds the limit of most songs in the past and present, but it never stopped him from singing it.  I'm sure critics told him to shorten it, but he didn't.  It stands out today in my mind as truly unique both in its lyrics, music, and length.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Fits my Chicco Liteway perfectly! Also holds my huge water bottle just fine. Super happy with it. It should fit most strollers on the market since the velcro parts that hold it on are adjustable.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's by Simon.  He has managed to blend his singing with that of Ladysmith Black Mombaso so well.  I've actually seen the documentary on the genesis of his trip that told the reason for his visit to Africa.  Even though Ladysmith was popular in Africa, few in America had ever heard of them.  Simon wanted to experiment with new sounds and introduce this band to America.  When the band came to New York to record, it was as if they were in a new world.  One of the members asked Simon if they had to secure a permit before they could play.  When Simon said, &#34;No, you're in America now, a big grin appeared on the elated faces of the black band. They had arrived in a new land with the opportunity to record their music.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Story, writing, art design and direction.<br /><br />I can't believe it took me this long to finally see it.<br /><br />I have no doubt I'll see it again soon!
B00AJER3SE|5.0|The newly remastered Blu-Ray of \\" The Terminator \\" is great!! The picture quality is spectacular , crisp an clear!! You know it's great when you start to watch the background of a movie you've seen dozens of times to see thinks you never noticed !! The sound is vastly superior to the old mono track of the DVD, but I think it was on the old Blu- Ray release . This is my pick so far this year for Blu-Ray of the year 2013 for new release of a old movie title
6302779278|5.0|this was a really wonderful movie, So nicely put together and you can't beat the great Whitney Huston. very talented
030759565X|5.0|I am one of the few here who does not read the Smitten Kitchen blog.  I received this book as a gift from a coworker who knows I love to cook.  So, I began reading with no expectations or preconceived notions of what I did or did not want in this book.  You as a review reader, might appreciate that I am not a fangirl, but am instead a fairly neutral reviewer.<br /><br />So, what do I like about this book?<br />1) As a former vegetarian, Perelman does interesting things with vegetables that I hadn't thought of, and haven't seen anywhere else, such as the cover recipe of savory tomato and goat cheese shortcakes, pickled celery for potato salad, raw zucchini and pesto salad, a shaved asparagus pizza, and a ratatouille sub to name a few exciting ideas.  We are not vegetarian, but we do eat a lot of vegetables and beans, so I love all the new ideas for using the ingredients we adore.<br />2) MOST of the recipes call for ingredients that I can buy in my small town. Two recipes call for miso, harissa, and farro.  I don't have anywhere handy to buy those, but every single other recipe is totally doable for me.<br />3) The photography is largely fantastic.  One photo in my copy is quite blurry, which is odd because the others are all crisp and appealing.  The photos make me want to become a better food photographer.<br />4) The writing style is friendly and natural.  While I love Ina Garten and use her books often, she is sort of hoity-toity.  Perelman comes across as the kind of girl I'd love to cook with, and then play Trivial Pursuit with after.  I like the stories about how she came up with her ideas, but some people might not love the chatty style.<br />5) The book has a great variety.  Breakfasts, baked goods, snacks, entrees, meatless dishes, pastas, pizzas, and more are all included.<br />6) These are largely recipes for those days you want to hang out in your kitchen- 30 minute meals this is not!  There are days when I need to just get something in our bellies, and I don't turn to this cookbook then.  But when I want to drink a glass of wine and relax while cooking, this book is wonderful.  That's not to say that every recipe takes all day, but the idea here isn't cooking in a hurry;  it is cooking for people who love to cook.<br />What I don't love:<br />1) She likes vinegar a whole lot more than I do.  But that's easy enough to fix by simply adjusting the recipe to what my family prefers.<br />2) Very few fish recipes.  Just one, if I remember correctly.  (I loaned the book to the same coworker who bought it for me, so I can't double check.)<br />3) She calls for table salt instead of kosher.  That's just me being picky. When cooking, I use whatever salt I want to use, and you should too.  In baking, however, I do use table salt.<br /><br />In short: if you want to be in-and-out of the kitchen; if you aren't a big vegetable lover; if you aren't a baker; or if you don't like \\"chatty\\" cookbooks, pass this book by.<br />If you like to take some time in the kitchen; if your family loves to eat lots of vegetables; and if you are stumped for original ideas, this book is the ticket.<br />One more thing: I've made the broccoli slaw for several friends, and all of them have asked for the recipe.  I think I've given it out 7 or 8 times- it is that good.I don't turn to this cookbook then.  But when I want to drink a glass of wine and relax while cooking, this book is wonderful.

B00B7FXZQS|2.0|It missed the punch/scare factor of the previous movies. I could almost anticipate what was coming and when. At no point did I feel scared.
B0091THDOM|4.0|a nice case maybe a little too snug. i like the case hopefully will loosen up as it gets more use
B008RTE09S|5.0|Wasn't their best film .of course , but still its The Beatles and some of the music is good! Yes!
B004LZRSBY|5.0|Nice good bye concert, a-ha as on its best times. If you want a sample of the 80's best music, this is what you need to hear.
B002JI94J4|5.0|Their first film at the height of the mania and  their best at capturing their life at that time as caotic  as it was, very funny!
B004P8A7J2|4.0|This is a hard look at the weakness in people that leads to addiction,  It culminates In a whirlwind of pain. Not for the squeamish.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Their second film , still in the mania period, Ringo comes off best as a comic talent and their first color film, great film to watch!
B005PK553C|5.0|I enjoy watching these different type of shows which gives us a breath of fresh air from reality tv shows! Love the abstract thought.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Usually not an action movie type but I loved every minute of this movie...must watch if have not watched it yet will be following up with Iron Man 2.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Terrific game - totally addictive.  I enjoy searching the rooms and very much look forward to visiting my 'friends', receiving and sending them gifts!!  Just takes a little patience to build diamonds and money rather than purchasing them at the store.  The only other issue is that every time I search the Japanese Gardens, the software requires a forced close.
B000W9DSVW|4.0|love the movie, the price was great for all three. but the picture is very grainy, especially low light scenes
B009R5GR1K|4.0|I use this app daily for the &quot;word&quot; and &quot;quote&quot; of the day.  The horoscope is fun and the games are a great diversion to begin relaxing during breakfast.<br />The articles are as extensive as needed.  The pronunciation is always helpful.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|The magic of Get Lucky is in the mixture; they have one of the funkiest guitar riffs from the last decade, beautiful vocals from Pharrell, and all put together with the robots' attention to detail. There isn't a single thing out of place for the duration of the track.<br /><br />It's also a return to a kind of music that hasn't been heard for years. This is a funky disco track modernised in an extremely elegant fashion.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the full album, specifically interested to see what they brought in Todd Edwards to do.
B00BQUUH7E|2.0|Its fun for the first few minutes then it gets easy so it gets boring i dont really recommend it
B004INHTK4|5.0|If you want success for your child you have to drive it. Saw that too in moonwalk by Michael Jackson
B00B671W6W|4.0|Good album, bu not great.  About what you would expect for an album of covers, but would it be asking too much for another Kiss cover.  know they've done a bunch, but . . .<br /><br />Joey's vocals do seem a bit off, but considering how long they've been around, I guess that is to be expected.  Jailbreak is the best by far on this disc, and I'm not exactly sure why they even bothered to include Crawl which was probably the weakest track on Worship Music, but I'm not complaining.  It's good to see that Anthrax is still putting out music after all these years!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|While a typical \\"hard\\" SF novel, it is well plotted and paced and Watney's usually  unorthodox  solutions to the challenges he faces  make this a good read worth the time and the price. Would definitely recommend the book and the author.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|A very good album from one of the best artist. Boz Scaggs is still putting out somme great music. Glad I bought this CD.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I've read the book and this movie was not true to the book. Some of the characters just didn't fit the profile that you'd imagine them to be and it's EXTREMELY apparent that  they are not singers.
B0068RHSZO|5.0|The movies with Greg was every bit as good as any James Bond and the Jonny Deph.  The garden in the window comes to mind
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great! It's not like most games where you get bored after five minutes.  It's exciting and constantly changing.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|i down loaded this alarm because the one i was using suddenly stopped working and so far this one is a great replacement.
B002R2B6NE|4.0|Awesome movie, with a truly great star.  When characters and plot ruled... not special effects.  A true classic, well worth revisiting if you want to watch a movie that is tense and driven by the characters and the script, not inane violence and effects.
B00B23O97Y|5.0|Excellent album. Great interpretations, as one would expect from E. Clapton. I also bought the CD, which is nice as well. I, of course, recommend.
B003YV0A02|4.0|A great action movie with good stars and still relevant themes.  Has lost none of its power (you will probably notice the lack of cell phones... but otherwise it loses nothing with time).  Well worth it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book is good.  My kids like it.  We have read the whole series.  It is great series. We recommend this book.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This was NOT a good book! And the message it gives about woman and relationships is appalling! This is a book about emotional and eventual physical abuse, and NOT a love story! I cannot believe there was such a massive uproar about this book.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|great game much better than the first one. lots of new stuff to do. you can use different main characters.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|the twist on the players from seet and innocent to tough and protective was a good way to show that while you can  be good you can also stand up for yourself
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is ausome I love the charecters!I really like how when you get farther along your person goes faster and faster.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Although I would like to believe such people exist, I think Rapp is almost the equivalent of Superman.  Still, this was a very enjoyable book to read.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Thrilling book! Greatly describes the Navy SEALs. I highly recommend this book to any thrill seeking American. True American hero's!
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box kept my interest all the way through.  The characters were realistic and human and believable.  The ending, however, stretched the imagination a little.  I do not believe the culprit would so easily confess.
B00BF11STU|2.0|the film was poorly edited perhaps...too dark at the end...couldn't see the picture. maybe this passes for an artistic license
B006LSZECO|1.0|The story seemed to be almost prepostorous in that one person could do all the things she did and got away with.  Also, the ending was hard to believe.  I do not think her husband could become so docile.  Further, the authorities became aware of his innocence and her guilt.  Thus, all he ahd to do was cooperate with the police.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|Robert pulled the best of the best for this album. Lalah Hathaway, Meshell Ndgeocello, and others come together to give a neo soul/jazz experience that is truly unforgettable.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I was really wowed with how good this one was. I have been waiting for three years to see this I one so I could watch part two with it.
B002P5XXR0|4.0|The track includes two versions of the music. I accidentally selected the remiced versions. I am OCD and it messes me up that at isn't EXACTLY like the movie. I still have it on all my music devices.
