B0002YLC24|5.0|It's not often that a sequel, especially one made nearly a decade later, is every bit as satisfying as a very good original, but this one manages it. The two twenty-somethings, one American and one French, who spent an entire night wandering around Vienna in the mid-'90s, and slowly falling almost-in-love, have run into each other again in Paris. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is now a published novelist, his book being a fictional account of that amazing night a decade before. Celine (Julia Delpy) seeks him out at a book signing and the two have a few hours to catch up with each other before Jesse has to catch a plane back to his wife and son in New York. You really have to have seen Before Sunrise to understand much of their conversation -- which they pick up almost as if they had never stopped -- but the dialogue is extremely human and therefore very affecting. Is Jesse happy with his life? He says so, at first -- but maybe not, given the subject of his novel. And why has Celine never found a permanent relationship? And did either of them keep their six-months-later appointment in Vienna? As before, the city itself -- Paris, this time -- is the third major character in the story. A lovely and romantic film.
B000002G7G|4.0|My brother bought this CD on the original Verve label in the early 90's with the Valentine mix.  This version on Polydor has the Closet mix by Lou Reed.  I really prefer the Valentine mix which is warmer, softer and more sensual particularly with the song Some kinda love.  The Lou Reed mix of this same song is dry in comparison.  If you are enough lucky for finding the Valentine mix, you should buy it.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I found out about this movie due to one person telling another on Facebook about it, and it got me intrigued; When I went on here to see what it was all about, it got me real interested and after a couple of weeks, I went into Blockbuster, rented it, took it home and watched it and I was glad and impressed with the  movie. It is about a regular joe(Joel Edgerton), who inherits a shoe factory handed down from three generations, and he gets it after his father dies. He isn't keen on it, but what the heck,it's a living; After finding out that competition for his shoes is being knocked out by cheaper and foreign imports, he runs into Lola, a cross dresser(played by Chewetel Ejiofor) getting beat by some punks and stops it. She is grateful, takes him to the club he works at, and while there, asks her about the footwear because it seems the footwear is geared for a woman's body, and cannot withstand the pressure of a mans foot. so then goes about making a boot for her which doesn't suit him initially, but with time sees his market, and goes about making that happen there, its like a marriage almost made in heaven. Of course, there's some disadvantages along the way in particular in the joes wee bit ambitious girlfriend, who wants him to sell off the factory to have condos built. As well as the long time employees who balk at the chance of making such boots. But with a lot of thought and energy, he sticks to his plan, goes to Milan, and, well, see that for yourself. Great music, fun and entertaining to watch.
B000002WEW|5.0|Loved the CD, however at the end of it are some bonus tracks of Hawaii tunes that are not on the original soundtrack that I recall from years ago.

B00204AA0O|2.0|Feels like the blood has been drained from Regina's veins with this album.  The early heartfelt expression and rawness of her other albums is GONE COMPLETELY GONE here.  Very over produced and bland and none of the songs have memorable tunes or strong musical identity like On The Radio and Fidelity. Nothing here to compare with her earlier work.  Regina sack the producers and do what you did before.   Change isn't bad but this certainly is change for the worse.  Meandering songs that go nowhere and warrant none of the epic orchestration involved.
0143037757|3.0|The book offers solid evidence as why it takes a generation or two before a work of \\"history\\" can be written.  The book starts well enough following the end of WWII and maintains some credibility and credence until about 1960.  By no coincidence, the author was born in 1948 so entered adolescence, the beginning of consciousness, about 1960.<br /><br />After that the book starts to fall apart.  While the facts keep on rolling (although some seem flat wrong but no references!), the analysis generally degrades into false strawmen and evidential self-contradictions.  It becomes too often a polemic rather than analysis and history.  It's as if the author had too much personal investment in issues or else was careful for his reputation amongst other European leftists.  His trashing of Thatcher is a case in point.<br /><br />Like so much of the Europe Project, the self-proclaimed \\"common values\\" imposed from the top down, so much just doesn't make sense to an American.<br /><br />While not gruesomely anti-American, the haute and snobbery and self-delusions are almost self-parody.  For example, he claims near the end that the defense of Western Europe was \\"sub-contracted\\" out to the Americans.  Having had family and friends serve in the American armed forces in Europe during the Cold War, and personally long paid taxes for the defense of Europe, \\"sub-contracted\\" is hardly the word that fits.  While our defense outlays were two or three times higher than those of Western Europe, they seem more free riders on their own security than paymasters.<br /><br />Frankly, the author is one of those Europeans I just don't see eye-to-eye with.  I can't help but view \\"public intellectuals\\" like Judt with the damning perspective of Paul Johnson's book \\"Intellectuals\\" - a source of great troubles.<br /><br />I will give the author credit (hence the 3 stars) for his encyclopedic knowledge.  There was a lot of details here that would escape most of us on the other side of the Atlantic, especially within the Soviet Bloc.  I did learn a lot but the inconsistent level of analysis and commentary brought the work down.<br /><br />One bright point was where he pointed out that WWII wasn't about the Jews and the Holocaust. They were just part of the general misery, a intensive and extensive part yes, but only a part, and a heart-rending story in itself.  The effort at placing blame and accountability was a way of opening the doors for Europeans to take a good hard, more honest, look at WWII.<br /><br />Another surprise was how he could differentiate in relative menace Communists in Russia (ie Stalin) from those in France and Italy.  To an American, ANY Communist is a potential totalitarian.  Dictatorship is a feature, not a bug, in the Communist ideology.<br /><br />Sure wish there was a book more solidly grounded in conservative thought that I could have read instead of the hours I spent on this one.  I think my next book on this topic will be Bessel's \\"Germany 1945.\\"cially within the Soviet Bloc.

B000071WE2|4.0|WOW! WOE! AND WHOOPS!<br /><br />WOW because the Monteverdi Choir opens this work 'DIXIT DOMINUS' with much excitement and fervor and speed.  In fact, the six choruses in this work are delivered with all the attributes that one would expect to hear in Handel's music that a very scholarly John Eliot Gardiner can ascertain.  My hand wanted so much to award this recording five stars, BUT<br /><br />WOE crept in with the first solo entrance performed by countertenor Charles Brett; his voice was 'edgy', very non-legato, close to being 'breathy'; in short, he either had a bad day or this music was not his 'bag' so to speak.  However, I have heard him on other recordings and he sounds much better on those.  The tenor voice of Richard Morton was OK, but he lacks the quality and style of some others I have heard sing this such as Mark Padmore or John Mark Ainsley.  The bass voice of David Wilson was quite resonant until he went into his lower register, at which time many of the word-endings did not come forth.  The soprano Felicity Palmer was, to my thinking, the outstanding soloist, performing beautifully both tonefully and stylistically.  Her solo 'Tecum principium in die virtutis' was a joy to hear!<br /><br />As for the WHOOPS, the tempos were somewhat questionable on two of the selections:  'De torrente in via bibet' (sopano duet) dragged on to the point of boredom, which is so unlike Gardiner, and one has  to wonder who was at fault? In the choral selection:  'Tu es sacredos in aeternam' the tempo was so fast that many of the words were lost, but I didn't care, because I knew the words and the sound was fabulous.<br /><br />Did I enjoy this recording? You bet I did!  And I'll listen to it and pass up most of the solo spots and enjoy the overall aggressive excitement of  a performance that only Gardiner can produce.  It's wise to bear in mind that over-analysis of any performance may cause us to lose sight of the joy therein.<br /><br />However, I own another rendition of this work that fulfills my expectations somewhat better than this one:  ten years later (1986) Cleobury made a recording with the King's College Choir and a superb line-up of soloists: sopranos Isabel Buchanan, Anne Mackay- countertenor Michael Chance- tenor William Kendall and bass Henry Herford. A great listening treat, although a totally traditional approach with an element of the romantic as opposed to the agressive.  But both of these discs have a place in my library.<br /><br />As for 'Zadok, the Priest', I think maybe the enjoyment of this work depends upon whether you prefer boy or female sopranos.  With Gardiner's Choir, the sopranos are so versitile that they can actually make their tone quality very Baroque, so it doesn't make any difference to me, either way.<br /><br />This is a reissue of an original 1976 (early in Gardiner's career) Erato recording and the liner notes are in Latin, French, German and English.t better than this one:  ten years later (1986) Cleobury made a recording with the King's College Choir and a superb line-up of soloists: sopranos Isabel Buchanan, Anne Mackay- countertenor Michael Chance- tenor William Kendall and bass Henry Herford.

B0014Z4OQG|2.0|Warning - Movie spoilers       Cloverfield's special effects were very good.  Many scenes most definitely got the viewer's blood pumping in fear such as the subway attack and when those things jumped off the monster and attacked a man while soldiers were fighting in the street.  There were many truly frightening episodes throughout this film.  The bouncing camera recording made it realistic as it reflected exactly what was occurring around the man holding it.  But, this film squandered so much potential.     The first 19 minutes were incredibly boring spent by Rob's best friend Hudson video recording people at Rob's going away to Japan party saying goodbye. Among the party attendees were Rob's ex-girlfriend Beth at the party with a new boyfriend, Jason (Rob's brother), Lily (Jason's girlfriend) and Marlena (Rob's acquaintance).  Then Beth gets embarrassed and leaves Rob's party because Lily blabs that Beth slept with Rob to Hudson who blabbed it to everyone he filmed.  Lily should have known better then to tell Hudson as Hudson was such an obvious big kid.  Karma gets Hudson but he didn't deserve it nearly as much as the 2 stars of this film.      The contrast of the movie is supposed to be between a happy Coney Island Rob/Beth trip being taped over by the unfolding horror of monsters attacking New York.  The real contrast turns out to be between wimpy Beth against the the growing courage of Lily and Hudson and Marlena who kicked monster booty saving each other with Marlena saving Hudson and getting severely injured and later dying in the process.  Two brave young people die trying to rescue one unworthy Beth. Another contrast was between Jason (strong) and his brother Rob (weak and rightfully called a douche bag by his own brother).  The adage the \\"good die young\\"  inversely means the not so good live and this was very apparent in Cloverfield.       Cloverfield's plot called for Rob to be the knight in shining armor and to rescue the helpless damsel Beth in distress regardless who dies doing it.  Laughably, she is actually found laying on her back with her eyes closed like Cinderella with clean fresh hair spread around her head in an enticing manner.  Amazingly all that thick 9-11 dust floating around from downed/damaged buildings never graced her body.  Even more laughable, Beth alternatively feigns between leaning on Rob to walk to running like a sprinter. The movie tries to have it both ways but the same adrenaline that got her running like a sprinter and lifting heavy debris off Rob after the helicopter crash SHOULD have gotten her up off that apartment floor and that single rod though a shoulder and outside to find safety by herself.        Initially after the monster attacks, Lily and Marlena act like flighty airheads ineptly running in high heels incapable of making a rational decision in an dire situation. Rob acts like a complete airhead feeling guilty because Beth is not with him and endangers the whole group going after her after Beth calls him to come get her because she \\"can't move\\". Turns out Beth was NOT hurt so bad that she could NOT have pulled herself off that thin rod which was only though a shoulder and not a vital organ and walk down those stairs to meet Rob/group of friends SOMEWHERE safer than Beth's dangerous apartment.  Beth certainly had no problem running down 57 flights of stairs after Rob and the rest came for her despite her \\"injury\\" and running like the wind when they got outside.      When Rob/Beth/Hudson took off in a military helicopter there were at least 2 soldiers possibly more with them.  When it crashes, these 2 losers (Rob/Beth) never checked to see if any military personnel were still alive after calling out and finding each other because this film is all about them.  While Hudson acted childish initially, he was was growing up fast and realizing a budding relationship with Marlena as she admires his courage and he hers but alas both die horribly in an effort to save Beth.  Hudson andMarlena could have been evacuated at the beginning of the film or walked out another way after the bridge collapsed.  Hudson could also have been evacuated at the soldier's camp where Marlena died but he didn't want to let his best friend Rob down and continued to follow him.       The plot could have been so much better if it showed the strengths of all the characters.  Beth could have called Rob and they all agreed to meet somewhere in the middle.  The film could have shown the courage of Beth getting off her butt out of that building and the hardships both groups endured making their way to this middle ground. This film squandered lives to save one undeserving one.  What a sad film when viewers find more interest/hope in the relationships between the fast maturing Hudson's budding romance with Marlena and the relationship between Jason/Lily than they are in the fake Rob/Beth.            A fitting ending for the in love selfish Rob and Beth who caused their friends to die and who cared about no one but themselves.  \\"After the credits a brief radio call is heard, saying \\"Help us\\" (meaning Rob/Beth). If played backwards, the audio states \\"Its still alive\\".  If karma is real, no one will rescue Beth a second time and the Hammerdown Protocol involved nuclear bombs so it won't matter if these 2 losers get out or not because the radiation will get them.
1554685273|5.0|This is a truly unforgettable book that will leave you unable to ever look at dogs in quite the same way again. Enzo and his family will tear at your heart in many ways and on so many different levels. Containing a wonderful, gripping storyline and characters that you will become deeply attached to, this is a sad yet ultimately uplifting book.<br /><br />Don't be scared away from this book by the title. The \\"racing in the rain\\" is a metaphor for life. Yes, one of the main characters races cars for a living and yes, Enzo refers to everything in his life by way of racing metaphors, but this book is so much more. It's about life and family, heartbreak and loss and ultimately joy, all as seen through the eyes of a dog named Enzo. Think MARLEY AND ME only narrated by Marley.<br /><br />Enzo, the narrator is a dog wants who nothing more than to be a man. On the eve of his death he tells what will amount to his master's life's story. Enzo has educated himself by watching too much TV, in particular Speed Channel and The Weather Channel. In his own words \\"the weather channel is not about weather it's about life.\\" Part of a happy family which includes; Denny, an up and coming race car driver, Eve, his wife and their young daughter Zoë. Enzo's life is cheerfully routine until the day he smells the cancer that has come to rest in Eves head. He can't warn her of course because dogs can't speak (Enzo continually reminds us of this) and as Eve's condition deteriorates their lives change forever. In the end Denny finds himself in a bitter custody battle that very nearly breaks him. Along the way Enzo must deal with possessed Zebras, the twins, hip displacia, hot peppers and demon crows all of which provided some great comic relief.<br /><br />Garth Stein has managed to capture the inner workings of the dog perfectly here, the attention to detail and the whys of dogs doing things is amazing. This really is a look at our human lives as only a dog could see it.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book and I can't recommend it enough although I would suggest not reading the ending in public as it made me cry, a lot. I will certainly be visiting Enzo again soon and giving him to all my friends as well.commend it enough although I would suggest not reading the ending in public as it made me cry, a lot.

B00000DOZV|4.0|For some, Genesis ceased to exist after Peter Gabriel left the group, but I think one misses out on some great material if they take that attitude.  Case in point is \\"Wind & Wuthering\\" from 1976.  Genesis had already survived the departures of drummers Chris Stewart, John Silver, and John Mayhew, and more notably Anthony Phillips.  In fact, the group had prospered quite well with replacements the caliber of Phil Collins and Steve Hackett.  \\"Trick of the Tail\\" had shown that the group had survived, \\"Wind & Wuthering\\" showed that it could still prosper.  It would be the last studio album before the group would reduce in size again as Steve Hackett departed after the tour which produced the live album \\"Seconds Out\\".  The group moved from progressive to pop after this album, though perhaps that categorization isn't completely fair.    \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\" opens the album a wonderful song which takes its subject matter from history.  \\"One for the Vine\\" is my personal favorites on the album, taking a look at faith, and the way humanity responds to spiritual leaders in the wrong way.  Banks uses vague references to not target any specific faith, but still manages to make an insightful comment.  \\"Your Own Special Way\\" is a love song, which is somewhat sappy, but then again sap works for a lot of people, and not too surprisingly this song was a fairly big hit.  \\"Wot Gorilla?\\" is an interesting instrumental piece which closes out the first half of the album.    \\"All in a Mouse's Night\\" is a song from a mouse's point of view which is somewhat unusual, but adds to the diversity of the album as far as subject matter goes.  \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\" is another top notch cut with some wonderful guitar work.  The song itself seems to be for those people who have no life of their own and watch endless amounts of TV, and there are numerous references to TV programs from England at that time.  \\"Unquiet Slumber for the Sleepers...\\" and \\"...In That Quiet Earth\\" are two instrumentals which are combined into one track on the CD I have.  \\"Afterglow\\" is the album closer, and it became the group's concert closer for many years as well.  A simple song, it is still a beautiful piece and a fan favorite.    The weaknesses of this album are few, yet significant.  The biggest one is the lack of Steve Hackett's guitar.  Only on \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\" do we get a decent amount of his work, and I wouldn't be surprised if that is the reason he left the group.  I don't dislike Banks' work, but one can only wonder how good the group would have been with some more balance.  The second problem is there are too many instrumentals on this album.  Three of nine tracks, and of course long instrumental sections of many of the other songs leaves the album short on lyrical content.  Without Peter Gabriel's lyrical input, the group is clearly suffering.  That being said, this is a good album, just not all it could have been.

B0014YVC6W|2.0|I had such fond memories of this movie from when I was a kid, that I bought it.  I started watching it with my children and was very disappointed.  The storyline and humor are perfect for children and youth, but they put in language that is almost as bad as you can get.  They did not define a target market and stick with it. Without the language it would be a great film for families.  With the language it makes it adult oriented, however I believe most adults will find it only slightly amusing.    If you are sensitive to foul language, don't buy it. I'll be putting mine on ebay.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|That's the counter-question that occurred to me viewing this film.  (I use the latter word even though celluloid is now as antique as a detachable collar.)  As film-making it's state of the art, with meticulous attention to period detail. (They get a few things wrong - not enough celluloid collars - but that I won't quibble over.)  The length and measured pace didn't bother me, either.  But at the end of it I was left with the same reaction I had to \\"Natural Born killers\\" and other arty explorations of violence:  And so - what?

0446604844|3.0|*Total Control* was amusing enough to read, although I didn't find it all too noteworthy. The story was good, although I don't think it was quite as interesting as some of David Baldacci's other books. *Total Control* is worth a read if you're looking for a book, but it isn't as enjoyable as many of Baldacci's others.    The main characters are a gorgeous woman and an FBI agent - surprise! This is pretty typical of Baldacci books; although the profession of the male character isn't set in stone, it's typically some sort of law enforcement job. The other characters are interesting enough.    The story isn't really anything special, and the first chapter (or was it the prologue?) struck me as a pointless way to increase the page count of the book. I imagine Baldacci thought more of that chapter was important than I do, but the important part, namely the demise of a particular characters, could have been easily condensed into a single sentence of dialogue a few chapters afterwards. The rest of the stuff doesn't really help at all with the reader's understanding of the book (or at least, it didn't to me) and as much as Baldacci wanted the reader to visualize what I imagine was some pseudo-scientific contraption (I can't really think of anything else off the top of my head and I don't want to research bizarre contraptions so that I can understand the plot!), I didn't. Baldacci also has some company names and other uses of \\"technological\\" terms (maybe they were new when the book came out, I wouldn't know) that just look silly to a modern reader.    This is worth a read if you have time on your hands but otherwise you might not want to bother with it. I just don't think it's as good as some of the other Baldacci novels.

0393324818|4.0|This book explores how statistical analysis of baseball games, called sabermetrics, are revolutionizing the way that professional baseball is played.    Moneyball follows the Oakland Athletics' general manager Billy Beane during the 2002 season, focusing on how they select players to draft and acquire through trades not by traditional methods, but based instead upon an objective statistical analysis using non-traditional statistics, allowing them to remain competitive with teams capable of paying much more money for their players.    Being someone who enjoys math and is interested in how efficiency is achieved, and despite having very little knowledge of baseball (the bulk of my knowledge comes from this book and from asking my dad questions), I found Moneyball to be thoroughly enjoyable.
B002CMLIJ6|3.0|After three movies of amnesia and claw-slashing, Wolverine is actually getting his own movie, all for his own. Sure, some familiar characters appear, but the stage is for him alone.<br /><br />And it's neither a horrendous movie nor a good one -- just a popcorn collection of explosions and Matrixian fight scenes, linked together by a rather loosely-strung plot that doesn't have any twists or unexpected events. Hugh Jackman does a simply stellar job as the beclawed titular character and it has some funny moments, but the part of the movie that galvanized me the most was the trailer for \\"District 9.\\"<br /><br />After a century of fighting, James Logan (Jackman) and his savage half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) are recruited by a mysterious army officer, William Stryker (Danny Huston), to join his elite mutant squad. Logan is sick of killing, so he tries to have the quiet life with his girlfriend Kayla (Lynn Collins) as a humble logger... until Victor reappears and murders Kayla, as part of a vendetta against his old teammates. Intent on revenge, Logan accepts the offer Stryker gives him -- he will accept a horrible and painful procedure that will make him invincible, so he can kill Victor.<br /><br />With an adamantium skeleton and an instantly-healing body, the newly-renamed Wolverine is invincible -- but he soon finds himself on the run not only from his older brother, but from Stryker's ruthless military forces. Now he must uncover a mysterious \\"island\\" that only one mutant has ever escaped from... except there are some other nasty surprises waiting for him there, courtesy of Stryker's experiments.<br /><br />By all rights, \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" should have been a far better movie than it is. But the story itself is only so-so -- it's rather straightforward in its narrative without many twists, and the Sabretooth/Wolverine backstory is handled pretty confusingly. It's only in the last quarter that the movie really acquires that epic comic-book feeling -- up until then, it's a rather bland you-killed-my-master/relative/truelove-REVENGE! tale.<br /><br />So with a bland plot, they slather on the action -- it feels like at least 75% of the movie was written to allow maximum explosions, motorcycle chases, Matrixian wire-fu, and endless claw fights. In fact, the movie is at its best when it has either some really tightly-wound fight scenes (such as the boxing match with The Blob), or a sense of humour (Wolverine accidentally destroys a nice little elderly couple's bathroom, and walks out repentantly holding their sink).<br /><br />And then there's Wolverine himself -- he can heal from anything, and his metal skeleton means he can't even be chopped up. In other words, he's indestructible. It's really hard to worry about the guy physically, and \\"Origins\\" never gets around to making us fear that he'll lose anything else.<br /><br />So it's a credit to Jackman's talent that he actually makes us care about Wolverine -- roaring, confused, grief-stricken, and slowly being hardened by all the betrayals and lies.

The thing that makes it worth watching: the actors.and you-killed-my-master/relative/truelove-REVENGE! tale.     So with a bland plot, they slather on the action -- it feels like at least 75% of the movie was written to allow maximum explosions, motorcycle chases, Matrixian wire-fu, and endless claw fights. In fact, the movie is at its best when it has either some really tightly-wound fight scenes (such as the boxing match with The Blob), or a sense of humour (Wolverine accidentally destroys a nice little elderly couple's bathroom, and walks out repentantly holding their sink).     And then there's Wolverine himself -- he can heal from anything, and his metal skeleton means he can't even be chopped up. In other words, he's indestructible. It's really hard to worry about the guy physically, and \\"Origins\\" never gets around to making us fear that he'll lose anything else.     So it's a credit to Jackman's talent that he actually makes us care about Wolverine -- roaring, confused, grief-stricken, and slowly being hardened by all the betrayals and lies. And Schreiber does an excellent job as well, especially considering that Sabretooth is as likable as an ingrown nail -- he actually almost makes us feel sorry for his character now and then.

B0015XHQTE|5.0|I ordered this collection for my husband for our anniversary. We are enjoying the product, and it is in very good condition. However, I ordered it on June 1st and I didn't get it until probably 3 weeks later. I don't know why it took so long, but I am glad that we have them now.
B001VPJYZK|4.0|After a great Start of the Season (and by that I mean the first 13 Episodes), the Season got somewhat disappointing. But what went wrong? We still had surprising deaths, juicy storylines and the usual DH Humor. The lack of a decent mystery hurt this season a lot. Everything was predictable (from the first Episode), there was no guessing left. Dave was a great character and also beautifully portrayed my Neal McDonough and it started out as a promising mystery. But soon the writers went into the obvious direction and pretty much revealed the mystery by Episode 10. The rest of the Season was Daves plan for revenge.    But not all is bad. There were some memorable episodes this Season as well as the 100th Episode of the show. It's still a fun show, and compared to a lot out there after 5 years still holds it's place as TV's best. Hopefully Marc Cherry will come up with something more intriguing for the shows 6th Season airing this Fall.    The 7 Disc Set will include these Extras:    - Audio Commentary \\"You're Gonna Love Tomorrow\\" by Larry Shaw, Doug Savant, Kyle MacLachlan, & James Denton  - Audio Commentary \\"The Best Thing That Ever Could Have Happened\\" by Creator Marc Cherry & Actress Brenda Strong  - \\"What More Do I Need?\\" A Very Good Read - From Script to Screen  - \\"I Know Things Now: Desperate Housewives Celebrates 100 - A Look Back At 100 Episodes Of Comedy, Drama And Cake Fights  - So Very Teri - Wisteria Lane's Favorite Girl Next Door...Funny, Beautiful, And She Does Her Own Stunts  - Cherry-Picked: Creator Marc Cherry's Favorite Scenes with Commentary By Creator Marc Chery (Gaby's New Game, Croquembouche, Pot Roast, Edie & Eli, Quite The Ad Wig, Jackson?)  -Bloopers  -Deleted Scenes (\\"What More Do I Need?\\" Alternate Opening, Out In The Open, Memory Lane, Aversion Therapy, Last Call, Mike Takes The Blame, Goo Goo Eyes, The Right Choice)  - Sneak Peeks    They seem to be packing a lot of Extras on the Set this time and it's nice to know that the audiocomentarieswill be back (after they were missing in the Season 2 and 3 DVD sets). Unfortunately there will only be 2 audiocomentaries out this time.    I can't wait for it. I'm sure that the viewing experience on DVD with no brakes will be even better then on TV.
B00192IV0O|1.0|WOW!!!!WOW!!! How disapointing. this album sucks so much is should have never seen the light of day. The least the BEP could have done is change their name to release this Electronic Garbage. I used to like them a lot but this will forever be a scar in their music carear.  Boom boom pow is good the rest just sucks. Get Elefunk and Monkey business instead.    DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. DOWNLOAD IT FREE FROM A SERVER AND LISTEN TO THE WHOLE THING FIRST!!!! IF YOU BUY IT, IT WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONTINUE THIS RADICAL CHANGE OF STYLE THAT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THEM BEING BLACK EYED PEAS.
B00079FUI6|5.0|When Desperate Housewives first aired in 2004 it broke all records for written comedy in years. Viewer tuned in to see this complex yet soapy view of everyday suburbia. And really, the appeal in Desperate Housewives is the fact that you know that behind every colorful facade and plastered smile lies a secret, sometimes little and juicy, other times tragic and dangerous.    There is something in the setting of this show. Everything is colorful, perfect and dreamy. But things in the lives of Susan, Bree, Lynette and Gabrielle start to unravel when the, seemingly perfect life of their friend Mary Alice Young ends tragically. After her suicide all that is left are dark secrets. The facade of perfect suburbia starts to crumble.    Clues are: a mysterious baby blanket of a child never seen before, a disturbed son who starts to remember shocking details from his past, a dangerous husband ready to do everything to cover up a dark secret, a spy on Wisteria Lane, a tape from Mary Alice's therapist, a threatening note and so much more.    Each episode gives hints and clues to the main mystery that spreads throughout the season and ends in a shocking cliffhanger filled finale. But the mystery is a backdrop to the real appeal of the series: the lives of our Desperate Housewives. Each one desperate to lead a perfect life and devastated when she realizes that it cannot be achieved. From the picture perfect Bree whose marriage starts to fall down, Lynette with her never ending job of being a perfect mom to her 4 children, Gabrielle who has everything yet feels a hole in her life to Susan who struggles to find love.     Each episode moves at high speed, so much is going on. It never gets boring. This is the perfect guilty pleasure and so much more. Marc Cherry, the creator, has planned every plot line from the beginning and it really shows. Everything is perfectly plotted and comes nicely together in the end. The comedy walks a fine line between dark humor and slapstick (Susan especially) with some great Zingers.    Buena Vista Home Entertainment has put together a great 6-Disc Set. All 23 Episodes of the 1st Season are presented in a crisp clear 16:9 widescreen transfer. The colors really pop out from the screen and add a lot to the overall tone of the show.     Extras include:  - Audiocomentaries from the Housewives on selected Scenes (which can be viewed as a half hour featurette)  - Audiocomentaries are provided for 5 Episodes including the pilot and the finale. They are all interesting. Creator Marc Cherry provides great insight into the show.  - Behind the Scenes of Desperate Housewives - a 25 minute Featurette about the creation of the show and the first season  - 3 Featurettes on the Costumes and Art Design (10 min.), DH Phenomenon around the world (10 min), Production Secrets (11 min.)  - Oprah Winfrey visits Wisteria Lane (8 min.)  - Outtakes  - Deleted Scenes (with optional commentary by Marc Cherry)  - Easter Egg (on Disc 4 i think)    Some of the Episodes are Extended and run about 45 min in length (as opposed to the usual 42 min.) adding bits and pieces to the storylines. These extended episodes include intros by Marc Cherry.    As you can see there is much to see and experiance in the first Season of Desperate Housewives. It's TV gone very right and a pleasure for everybody. I highly recommend it.    5/5 Stars.
B0002S947K|5.0|This is an excellent CD with amazing tracks and beautiful lyrics.  Great gift idea for your partner!!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This is an outstanding book about a courageous group of individuals that every American citizen should take time to recognize and appreciate their sacrifices. Unfortunately, our nation only tends to remember the brave folks defending our country once they have given the ultimate sacrifice. Hopefully after reading this book folks will start to open their eyes & hearts to start realizing how much each & every member of the US Military sacrifices on a daily basis. The story is outstanding and at times may be hard to believe for folks that did not spend time in the military. The book is excellently written and at times the reader will find themselves wanting to run out and enlist. At the end of the book, you will truly appreciate all that our US Military does for us on a daily basis and how unfortunate it is that the liberal media reports on only the negatives of what our military must endure. This book will bring a tear to your eye, and love to your heart for our Serviceman & women!! It makes me appreciate the 11 years I spent in the US Army & US Navy (VF-211, USS Nimitz 88-92). I will forever respect, love & honor what the individuals in this book / mission did. But more importantly, what every service member does on a daily basis. If you appreciate your freedom, thank a veteran!!! You will after reading this book!!God bless the USA, and each member of our military on active duty and keep them for harms way!!   PS - Read on Kindle 2, and they did leave out some of the photos that are in hard copy, which I wish they had included
B001PA0FFO|5.0|The transition from stage to screen is the work of art in this acting triumph.  A detective story with no technical detective on scene.  A brush with our conscience back in the 1960's.

B000002JPA|1.0|I just didn't get it. Primarily a display of technique with little musical content. The score of this music would be good technique development material for students of the various instruments used on this album.    After a few listens I gave this CD away.

Every beat on every track is sauce!  They all got that #1 hit feel 2 it!  Besides that, Dr. Dre is a very talented rapper!
B000ZN802W|4.0|This is a movie about a hobo named Alexander Supertramp who discovers that he has magical powers.    Although Alexander is a hobo who rarely ever bathes, every woman thinks he is a dreamboat, and every man wants to be his best friend.  One man even wants to adopt him!      Every person who meets Alexander becomes tearful when they must say goodbye to him.  But he doesn't care.  He only cares about being a hobo.    *** There is more nudity than I was expecting in this movie.  Most movies about hobos do not contain this much nudity.  There is both male and female nudity (including genitals).    Aside from the nudity, this movie has a reasonably positive message about hobos.
0439023483|5.0|When I first read the summary for this book at a bookstore, I almost threw it on the ground and wanted to stomp it as a rip-off of Battle Royale. However, I knew that wouldn't be fair since I haven't even read it yet. Half a year passes by and I decided to finally read it due to all the hype. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! Wow, this book even became a favorite of mine. To all you out there who think this will be another cheesy copy of Battle Royale, you should read it for yourself and become addicted like I am. Yes, the general plot is similar (a country forcing kids to kill each other each year in a tournament to keep the economy stable) but somehow The Hunger Games pulled off a different story line altogether with Collins' own interesting twists. I highly recommend this book if you're into post-apocalyptic/dystopian fiction.
0307408833|5.0|if you miss truly delicious desserts because of a restrictive diet, this is an awesome book.  the down side is you will have to buy a million ingredients you never heard of before, but anyone who is on a gluten-free diet or loves someone who is already knows this and has half of them already.  don't scrimp and substitute.  following these simple recipes exactly will net you unbelievable results.  you will cry when you bite into the cookiewitches.  unbelievable!!

B000AWYOGE|4.0|DARK WATER    This American film based on Hideo Nakata's original movie [which was based on a book so it may not be completely original] is actually a lot better than most American remakes of Asian horror cinema. The first time I watched this movie I was expecting something along the lines of \\"The Ring\\" or maybe the \\"The Grudge\\" but was pleasantly surprised when this one seemed more surreal. It does an excellent job with the characters and makes the story seem very believable. I had a good time with this one when with others I was really not much of a fan.    Dahlia and her daughter Cecelia are looking for a new apartment on Roosevelt Island in New York City, Cecelia needs to live close to a good school it seems. Dahlia has a new job and at the same time is going through a divorce with a husband that does not trust her judgment. Once they find a place strange things start to happen like a constant water leak that is in her daughter's room. Also add in the strange noises coming from the place above her place and you have a cool little film a brewing. Of course you can't forget that this is a mystery/ghost story at heart.    Director Walter Salles does a nice job in letting the story tell its self instead of pushing things along at a fast pace. He also elects to let the characters build on them selves and actually develop, that seems rare now a days. Also writer Rafael Yglesias [also a writer on the Johnny Depp flick \\"From Hell] did a nice job in this American version. To be completely honest with you I was not expecting a ghost story like this one from this one. I really felt that it would look like every other remake that has come out since \\"The Ring\\".    The thing that really makes this film interesting is the acting from this top notch cast, every one did a good job on this one. Jennifer Connelly is great as Dahlia Williams and makes the character seem like an actual person. Her daughter is played by Ariel Gade who like Jennifer does a great job which is rare forchild actors, especially in this type of film. Of course the ever excellent Tim Roth is brilliant in this film as a lawyer who actually comes to this lady's aid when she needs it. John C. Reilly may steal the show some what as the shady land lord who always makes a promise he can not keep. Dougray Scott, Pete Postlethwaite, and Camryn Manheim all also give excellent performances.    As the film goes on it goes from being about pesky neighbors to a ghost story to a crime mystery and it still manages to feel like the same film. This is not the best movie ever and may not be for every body but it definitely will appeal to some. I would recommend this one to any fan of mystery films or ghost stories. By the way the ending to this is excellent.
B000001E3V|5.0|In my opinion, Derek and the Dominos In Concert is the best live rock LP in history. Also, the most inspired and inspirational. This set is a compilation made much later from the same shows with different set lists etc. Just get both and wear them out.  These concerts show you why Clapton is with Beck, The Beatles, Bob Marley and the Wailers et al. as the greatest pop/rock acts of all times.
1439157383|1.0|I agree with the review titled \\"Oh, if she'd only stopped twenty pages before it actually ended\\" by Robert P. Beveridge \\"xterminal.<br /><br />I especially agree with what he said about Sara.  Most of what I know about the legal system, I've read in novels, but surely no real judge would have allowed Sara to be opposing counsel for this hearing.  The writing and characterization is so schmaltzy and hokey, it became more annoying with every page.  The ending wasn't really a surprise, since readers of Jodi Picoult's novels have come to expect something unexpected at the last minute, but this one is so preposterous, it leaves me stuttering.<br /><br />The only believable aspect of the whole novel is the effect the family's focus on Kate has had on Anna and her brother.  Thankfully, I've never been in such a harrowing struggle, but wouldn't parents who are so devoted to one child get at least a little bit concerned over all the acting out their son is doing.  The ending to his story, however, is just as unrealistic as so many other things in this book.
B00009R6H2|2.0|don't waste your money on these quick releases.  purchase ones from \\"Really Right Stuff\\" (with head base plate) and you will have the best in size, weight and usability.)    These are very clumsy to work with and there is better on the market.

0345337581|5.0|This is a great book for a newbie - if you have not yet started, but want to - then this is a good starting place.  If you don't achieve what you want in the first 90 days, give it 6 months to try again.  It is very basic which is what some people need.

0141034599|5.0|It took me more than half a year to finish this book. It's just so disorganized to me. I left it on my desk idle for 5 1/2 months and finished it just this past weekend. It can be summarized in a few words: Don't waste your time trying to predict. Future is unpredictable. Live at the moment. This is it. Don't waste your time reading the whole thing.    Yet, I gave 5 stars to this book because it's so sarcastic. Simply this book hitting bookstores and on its way as an international bestseller is a black swan.

B000002I57|5.0|This 1959 recording displays tenor saxophonist John Coltrane at his peak, along with vibraphonist Milt Jackson, who was always at his peak. The CD offers three bonus tracks that add 20 minutes of music to the original LP release, and also give the album a better balance of ballads, blues, and straight-ahead jazz.<br />Accompanied by Hank Jones on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Connie Kay on drums, Jackson and Coltrane present a nice assortment for your jazz playlist: three of Jackson's own blues tunes, each with a different character; a Charlie Parker bop favorite; and four jazz standards, two of which are beautiful ballads.<br />The original liner notes are reprinted in the insert. Overall, an nice package of classic material.

B000003TAW|4.0|The best song for me and the reason why I purchased it's because of Buddy Holly, I can listen to it 10 times and never be tired of it.   My name is Jonas is a rock song has good guitars, heavy   No one else, the same good rock song.  The world has turned and left me here, Good song with heavy guitars, after Buddy Holly it is my preferred, with guitars solo. it should be played when you drive in a highway, better if you have a Harley Davidson with CD player like I have that you listen to it and love/enjoy your venture.   Buddy Holly, excellent, heavy rock because of strong guitars but light with the solo singers. On a highway or in the cities or beach you can play it together with Ramones, it is the same sensation, can be put together in the beggining if you are recording some Black Sabbath.  this can be played 10 times , you get addicted to it. I love it. The remaining so so..  In the reality you get used to the whole disc, it should be played while you are using a computer to enjoy the remaining.  It worthed because of wonderful 'Buddy Holly'  As native brazilian, 48 yrs old, I can say this CD pleases all ages that love good music.
0307269981|2.0|As someone who enjoyed Larsson's first book, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\\" I was looking forward to the sequel.  But it's extremely dull and it took me a couple of months to finish as I kept putting it down and reading other books, coming back to this one only reluctantly when I had nothing else to read in the house.  Larsson fills the book with mind numbing and irrelevant detail (such as an entire list of items that the heroine buys at IKEA and descriptions of every character, no matter how minor) and it takes him 100 pages of filler just to get to the beginning of the story.<br /><br />When the meat of the book finally begins, it just isn't that interesting, despite the set-up of two murders for which the heroine seems to be responsible.  I liked the first book precisely because the heroine isn't all that likable.  But in this one, she's pretty close to detestable (although clearly Larsson means for her to come across as sympathetic) and the author has her engage in some unlikely actions in order to set up plot points.  Moreover, the author's extremely liberal point of view about men, cops and journalists and, in particular, about sex crimes, comes across, once again, in such heavy-handed fashion, that even if you agree with his point it just becomes tiresome.  The characters, with the exception of the two main ones, are one-dimensional, cookie-cutter stereotypes,  and the bad guys, in particular come across with no nuance.  Given that the book is a murder mystery involving sex crimes, it would have been nice to have had a better explanation for the bad guys' actions, ala Val McDermid, who is both better at writing a mystery and a getting into the heads of sexual deviants.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that this book doesn't hold a candle to the first one, so unless you were a huge, huge fan of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I'd recommend giving this one a pass.
B001U6YI92|5.0|I will preface this review by admitting that this is one of my favorite films of all time. I fell in love with this movie when I was a  kid, watching it on a 13\\" black and white tv. Given that this is a movie that needs to be watched in \\"widescreen\\", it tells a lot about how wonderful the story is that this film can be enjoyed on even the worst of presentations. As the years have gone by,  I have been able to watch this film in better visual circumstances: videotape in color, dvd on a widescreen, \\"restored\\" dvd on a larger widescreen, and now finally in Blu-Ray on a HD tv. The film has lost none of its magic for me, (I have come to realize that this is more of a fantasy film than a western). I appreciate how the moral tones of the story are much more subdued as compared to the \\"black/white- good/evil\\" storytelling of earlier westerns. The camera work in this film is so unique: we are presented with vast expanses of hilly terrain with a barely visible rider on a horse, to extreme facial/eye close-ups with insects darting around the actors face. The story is humerous at times- with both physical and verbal comedic elements, as well as sad- with extremely deep emotional scenes regarding life, death, and the value of both. The scene where Tuco confronts his brother in the Abby remains to this day, upon countless viewings, very powerful to me. In my opinion it is the most dramatic scene in the film. It is when we realize that these characters are multi-demensional- and cannot be pegged as just \\"Good, Bad, or Ugly\\". We as humans are all three.       Then there is the music. Ennio Morricones score is as much of a character in this film as any of the actors. It is pure magic.       So, is the Blu-ray worth the upgrade? In my opinion: Yes. I had reservations as to how much improvement could be made to this film. I can tell you that, while this film will never look as good as films made today, it actually looks better than my dvd version, which itself was restored. It looks clean, with very fine film-grain. I would say that if you have a blu-ray player and an HD tv, and you really do love this film, it is worth the upgrade.

In his latest effort, they are back, better than ever.  The characters (even the bad ones!) are realistic and endear themselves to the reader.  Mr. Rollins has the uncanny ability to take a topic, weave an incredibly complex and compelling story and bring it all together so very, very well.

B000E1YVZU|1.0|I saw Rent twice on stage and have the soundtrack memorized. I was excited to see it had come out on DVD as well... until I watched it.<br /><br />Seeing it on stage was transcendent. This movie cut a bunch of the songs (time constraints?), cut many of the layers out of some songs that were kept (too hard to film on their budget?), and turned many lines that were sung in the original into spoken dialogue (wanted to make it a musical instead of a rock opera?), which felt awkward and flat.<br /><br />They also changed parts of the story. For example, in the stage version, April left a note to Roger saying the two of them had AIDS and slit her wrist in the bathroom; in the film, he's standing beside her as she gets her test results and we're to assume she died of AIDS-related complications, which takes a lot of the punch out of Roger's character. In the stage version, all of Act One happens on Christmas Eve; in the film, it's split up into two (or more?) days for no apparent reason, which makes the lyrics of some later songs inaccurate. The conflict between Roger and Mark is entirely left out of the film.<br /><br />I think the film version still delivers an important message, but it lacks a lot of the artistry and power of the original. I see that a filmed-on-stage version is now available, which wasn't the case when I bought this movie. I'd highly suggest getting that instead.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm not a fanatic workout-holic, but I do go through my phases of working out.  My problem is that I'm impatient.  Like most people, I want to see results quickly so that I get motivated to stick with the workouts; and I also don't want to spend more than 30 min exercising.  I have to say... this DVD was a pleasant surprise.  The workouts are short and sweet, but you definitely feel 'em and see the results pretty fast (as long as you stick with the program).  30 Day Shred is as good as, if not better than, the Biggest Loser workout dvds.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have read a number of the books this series is based on and I have to say HBO has nailed this one. The cast is great, the production values high and the writing solid. The openning credits are great too. The series differs in some ways from the books, but I like that as it makes it more interesting and in some cases has improved the story line and some characters. Buy the series set. and read the books, it's all good fun.

B000P12LWY|3.0|I like HBO and I like history. This show has good production values and a  fine cast and story, but watching it it just seemed like just because HBO can show naked people having sex they seem to feel they have to. Sex is fine and it can be used to farther a story, but it got to the point where it was too distracting and often unnecessary.
B0029LHWHM|5.0|An excitingly interesting read! There are concequences in having unquestionable faith. So far, the only defenses from religion are \\"you cannot prove God doesn't exist\\",...\\"you non-theists are just picking on us\\". Well I don't need to be a unicornologist to know unicorns don't exist, and that's all the proof I need. And not to mention religion mostly resorts to threats and name-calling in order to defend their case (quite childish). If you question the mental health of someone who believes that invisible fairies make gardens beautiful,...the you should do the same towards unlucky copper pennies, crossing a black cats' path, magic underwear(Mormonism), talking snakes, talking fiery bushes, a sky-god that can hear all the voices of his followers in his head(psychologists call this hallucinating), ect. Religion fosters the thought process of \\"I'm right because it's in my holy book and God said so.\\" This means that any scientific discoveries, proof, and evidence that shows the inaccuracy and delusional fairy-tales of a Holy Book would be discarded by the religious. So sad that a person should go thru life obsessed with fear, death and the deluded second chance of an afterlife(which promotes laziness and procrastination), when life is so much more beautiful when these delusions are set aside.<br /><br />An imaginary friend such as God is not necessary to be a good and moral person. People don't get their morals from some holy book. If they did, it would be like saying everyone is immoral until they have a high enough vocabulary to read and understand a holy book.On top of that, they would still be considered immoral until they read, understand, and practice everything in such a book. Sometimes I feel as if I am the only who truley read the bible, because I honestly don't think \\"women = property of men\\" is a good moral to have. This country (America) gave women their rights and freedoms, and a holy book tries to take them away. Women who welcome and tolerate this form of self-inflicted mental torture should be ashamed of themselves for encouraging male supremacy in society; which actively works against any woman trying to exercise her equal rights in this country.<br /><br />Going thru life with an ancient scriptural thought process is like seeing someone dressed like George Washington but in present day, and that person trots themself around as if it were the best and latest fasion trend: Wig, powdered face, lipstick, skin tight pants, fake mole, ruffled blouse, and proud of it.<br /><br />Can you see the obsurdity between \\"Intelligent Falling vs. Gravity\\", \\"Intelligent Design vs. Evolution\\",...and \\"Stork Theory vs. Human Reproduction\\"? Why do people default to supernatural-superstition for serious questions they are unable to find answers to? It baffles me, especially when any rational person would simply say, \\"I don't know, but it's worth investigating\\".<br /><br />Well,...my blood-pressure can no longer tolerate Bruce Bain's ignorant intellect, manipulative reformation of quotes, intellectually high-treasonous, blatent, willful, malicious, immature, vindictive, meniacle, and delusionally twisted religious lack of reason, logic and understanding. The last time I met someone this deluded and twisted was in Dayton, Tennessee(full of people like him and home of Bryan College; mentioned in TGD Ch.8); he should move there and feel right at home. Does he treat his friends, family, and strangers this way?! He quite accurately fills the shoes of the Fundamentalist that Dawkins mentions so often in his book. He shouldn't bother replying to this review, I won't answer and it will be a waste his obsessive energy for his robotic wheel-of fortune(or magic 8-ball if he prefers) typing and conversation style. As I stated in other post replies; I have more productive things to do with my time on this unique complex-life sustaining planet; such as wooing women away from people like him, teaching children evolution, advocating circumstantial abortion rights, advocating stemcell research, helping people recover from religious psychosis, upholding the separation of church and state, advocating forced religion on children as mental torture and as cruel and unusual punishment, keeping religion out of state and federally funded schools and colleges, teaching people that 'In God We Trust' was a 1950's incorporation, research and developement, and whatever else tickles my brain matter into releasing awesome chemicles and hormones thru my body.<br /><br />Good day Mr. Bain, ~ Jeremy M.

0385341008|3.0|Cute, and I mean that almost to a fault. Kind of took serious subject matter (the deprivation of war, life in concentration camps, etc.) and baked it with enough sugar to make it palatable for those who might not otherwise  like to read about such things. I could totally see this as a movie though, most likely starring Brenda Blethyn and a cast of plucky Brits. Hillary Swank or Gwyneth Paltrow could lend the film a marquee name as the lead, a London journalist named Juliet. The whole story is told as a series of letters, which I wasn't too keen on, personally. I probably would have liked it more, felt more attachment to the characters, had it been told in more straight-forward prose.
B000VECAC6|5.0|yes its a great movie we all know that,what is lacking is a translation to high def;and i was thrilled, in other words the picture was crystal clear as if it was a recent movie and the sound levaling was spot on forget about the movie the point is,is it worth the purchase evan if you have a vhs or dvd copy of it,and of course the answer is yes!

B001P3SA94|4.0|This gets 4 stars--flaws and all--just because anyone who tries to raise public awareness about these musicians should get huge props. The Chess greats have been my life-long heroes, and as a harp player I was particularly thrilled to see Little Walter given so much attention in a Hollywood movie--no matter how maudlin. And boy is this movie maudlin! Really cheesy stuff, but movingly acted by the cast and with great art direction (cars and amplifiers are photographed with almost fetishistic love of the period).   Unfortunately the film had some major shortcomings, some of which I've already seen mentioned by other reviewers. The biggest disappointment for me was the omission of one of the absolute greats of the era--Sonny Boy Williamson II, who had a HUGE influence on 60's blues rock. He was also a hilarious character and would've added much to the story. Although Eamonn Walker did a very credible job on Howlin' Wolf's vocals and the great Kim Wilson did justice to Little Walter's playing, some of the other musical elements were a trifle lacking. Jeffrey Wright's singing was quite weak, and Beyonce's contemporary R&B riffing was a bit anachronistic (although she seemed to have made some effort to emulate James' phrasing). Having a completely irrelevant contemporary pop song by Beyonce during the credits was a travesty--obviously forced upon the filmmakers by her manager or something...it really marred an otherwise earnest effort.

B000TCEU4Q|5.0|I've been using it with FS2004 and FSX, and works like a charm with each two. I didn't even install the CD. Do not forget to fine tune your idle zones though; it kept me busy through forums for like an hour. If you do not do it properly, the throttles work within like 20%-80% instead of 0%-100%. Setting idle zone sensitivities to just 0 worked for FS2004 (I did nothing for FSX).
B00008BXJG|5.0|A lot of people will tell you Back in Black is AC/DC's best album. And maybe it is, but this one is every bit as good if not better.     Of course you have the title track which is one of their best songs right off the bat. But look at this list of songs, I mean, simply incredible to get all this on one album. (Not these days anyway)    Girl's Got Rhythm, Walk All Over You, Shot Down in Flames, and the epic If You Want Blood (You've Got It). Even the song's I don't mention are great.
0321525655|5.0|I would like to have had this book when we were preparing presentations in the Pentagon.  Reynolds provides practical methods for organizing thoughts and presenting ideas in ways to strike and keep an audience's attention.

0879309210|4.0|I find this book has great information on about every aspect of guitar set-up and repair. It has quite a bit packed into it. Some of it I already knew, such as adjusting the truss rod and setting the intonation, but each area had a little tid bit that was a something I wasn't entirely familiar with making every section worth while.    It doesn't go into great depth on several subjects but others it does.  Although, if you need more depth on a particular subject then buying a book that deals with that area is best. (Such as refinishing)  Some areas were a little dated even though this is the 3rd edition.    Over all a great book.
B001PR1ULA|4.0|This cerebral mystery had me guessing to the last few pages.  Christie incriminates almost everyone along the way and, like Dorothy Sayers, offers delightful and entertaining glimpses of English country life.  The plot, although a murder, echews gore and  guts and  presents a puzzle to be solved replete with gentle humor and romantic interests.  This book is classic Christie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

006113127X|4.0|I absolutely loved Post Office and also enjoyed Factotum.  As great as Bukowski proved himself as a poet, his prose is even better in my opinion.    That said, Factotum seemed to be a bit of a watered-down version of Post Office.    The main character, Henry Chinaski, bounced around jobs so much that it was sometimes hard to remember where one left off and another began.  Where Chinaski in Post Office had clear needs and opposition preventing him from fulfilling those needs, Chinaski in Factotum was just kind of floating through life.    Like the unforgettable scene in first book, when Chinaski argues with a superior about filling mail trays, this book also has that one incredible scene when Chinaski talks to his drinking, gambling friend who's looking for a woman.  You'll know exactly what I'm talking about once you read it.
1439157383|2.0|I am someone who rarely has the time to just sit down and read. I really wanted to read this book before seeing the movie.  I wish I had just seen the movie and didn't bother with the book.  I agree with some of the reviewers that it was overly contrived and melodramic.  Each chapter was told from a different characters point of view.  I would find myself putting the book down when certain characters were telling the story. I really didn't care what they were thinking. I too hated the ending.  It was such a cop out by the author.  As I read this, I kept thinking of the story The Sound and the Fury which I read in highschool.  It was told in a similar fashion but features realistic tragic characters.
0743270754|5.0|I am interested in the life of Abraham Lincoln ever since my grandfther gave me Gore Vidal's Lincoln about 20 years ago. It was love at first sight. Lincoln's story is so compelling that it is hard to not nurture an extreme simpathy for him.  I have read Doris Kearns Goodwin's book within 10 days. It is clearly a result of extensive research and I thank Mrs Goodwin for that. By myself I would never get to the level of detail on the events that led a defeated Senate candidate to the most grandious Presidency in American history (some may debate my opinion, so give or take top 3).    Some critics may say it is biased, that Mrs Goodwin has an agenda to put forward, and so on. I think it is a wonderful book written carefully and passionately about one of the most important humanitarians of all time.    If you are a Lincoln expert, however, I can understand if you find the narrative too romantic. Likewise, if you believe the confederates had a better point in the war, you may find the pro-yankee rethoric a bit offensive but, in the author's defense, the book is about the winning side.    5 stars, 2 thumbs up, and a standing ovation to Mrs Goodwin for putting this effort through to everyone to enjoy.

1439138311|2.0|So many critics seemed to like this book, but it's a story that's been told before. Girl who is second fiddle to her more glamorous sister goes off on her own to America. Finds her calling and a devoted, loving man who wants to be with her forever. Returns to her homeland after tragedy strikes. Is tempted to stay, but then finds herself again and returns to America with renewed determination. Ho, hum.     The novel, although simply and flawlessly written mechanically, lacks strength and uniqueness. The characters feel like cardboard cutouts. I'm glad I waited my turn to check it out from my local library.

1439102813|5.0|Very rarely do I get lost in a book.  This was one.    The descent into the blankness of Alzheimer's was tender and heartwrenching.  It was never overly sentimental or trite. Alice's experiences were thought provoking, tragic, victorious, and real.     Yes, Alice is the one who makes the longest journey.  She is the one with the disease. However, each person in her life -- each minor and major character -- is affected also.  Everyone, including Alice, becomes distilled into his or her true character around the changing Alice.  Some are shown to be the types of people we all hope to have in our lives.  Some less so.  And, we understand how each of them got there.    A wonderful book.  A story that grabbed me and made me think how I want to treat those with Alzheimer's.  It reminded me how much we are ourselves even if that self can't communicate well with the outside world.
B00005QGAT|5.0|I'll keep the personal comments limited as this is a product review!    Michael Jackson's \\"Off The Wall\\" was his first album as a solo artist for Epic Records under the guidance of the legendary Quincy Jones. While R & B had its share of fans, Michael and Quincy helped make it with some appeal to mainstream audiences. With tunes such as the title track, \\"Don't Stop 'Till Get Enough\\", \\"Rock With You\\",\\"She's Out Of My Life\\" and \\"Working Day & Night\\", this now classic helps establish Michael as a force in R & B with pop influence! This would later be cemented by the next album. I am sure you've heard of it as it goes by the name of \\"Thriller!\\"    My personal favorite tune on here is \\"I Can't Help It.\\" The original song is just a mellow, almost spiritual song about love and devotion. I don't know about anyone else but I love listening to it everytime it plays.  While not a known song by Michael, it has been sampled many times by hip-hop artists and other singers. The most notable was on Mary J. Blige's album \\"Mary\\" as she used its sample for one of her songs.     In short, they changed the game as far as that style of music is concerned! Regardless of what I thought of the man later personally, his musical legend can't be questioned. Highly recommended CD for fans of Michael or just want some good old school R & B music with a touch of pop in it.

Had he studied zen Lipton would have arrived sooner; but it just wouldn't have been by the way of micro biology.   It's unfortunate that the subtitle, \\"Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter & Miracles,\\" is misleading. This is a fine biography, but it doesn't tell us anything about how to \\"unleash\\" whatever hidden powers we have. I was waiting for \\"the\\" secret to be divulged. For that we should turn to Deepak Chopra who reveals a multitude of secrets to unleash our hidden powers.  I would recommend the Biology of Belief to all science majors.

0679745203|5.0|It's true that most of my recreational reads are action/adventure/mystery with a lot of movement. But I really am trying to get a bit more introspective and appreciative of different writing styles.  It was recommended by a friend that I read The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje.  In a word, wow.  It was far from my normal fare, but I quickly got drawn into the imagery and way that Ondaatje was able to take four separate individuals with different stories and weave them into a single plot.<br /><br />I did have to take my time and trust a bit that it would all come together.  The first scene involves Hana, a fatigued nurse holding vigil over her last patient, a severely burned pilot known as \\"the English patient\\".  While the end of World War II is almost there, she remains at the converted hospital, just her and the patient, amid the rubble of bombings and shellings.  There's not much background as to who they are and why she refuses to leave.  In the second scene, Caravaggio, a thief who's hands were mutilated as punishment, arrives at the hospital, and tries to figure out who the patient is in real life, as well as how he feels about Hana.  And finally, Kip arrives at the hospital.  He's an Indian \\"sapper\\", one who goes in and disarms unexploded ordinance.  He's never allowed himself to be close to anyone due to his particularly short life expectancy.  But Hana is under his skin, and he has to start understanding someone else aside from only himself.<br /><br />Once all the characters are given their time and space as individuals arriving at the hospital, the stories start to merge.  Caravaggio thinks the English patient to be someone else entirely.  Caravaggio teases the story from him, learning exactly what role he might have played in the war.  And via the wireless, they all hear news that completely changes their view of everything they stood for and believed in.  And that causes their own shared universe to go spiraling out of control once again...<br /><br />I enjoyed this far more than I expected I would.  I learned to slow down my pace and just let the story flow over me and unfold as it wanted.  I also had to trust that it was all going to come together in a way that was not going to make me regret the time I had spent reading it.  I also learned quite a bit on how a good author can paint the surroundings with words, and put you right there in the middle of the scene, complete with the appropriate emotions and atmosphere.<br /><br />Of course, now I need to see the movie version of it. :)more than I expected I would.

0802136834|5.0|The reason I want to buy the book is that when I was watching the TV series-the Tudors, I was attracted by the magic life of Henry VIII. But as we all know the pace of TV show is slow.

0061245097|5.0|One Foot in the Grave by Jeaniene Frost. This is the second book in the series. Its about Cat who is now working as a special agent for the government and Bones (Crispin) who she left behind 4 years ago. They meet up again and do battle with Cat's father who is trying to kill her and Ian who wants her under his control as part of his lineage. There are some great fighting scenes and one heck of a romantic/erotic scene that could possibly make you sweat! I love the writing of Ms. Frost. This book kept my interest all the way through. Highly recommend the first two in this series.

B00005S6K6|3.0|I personally love Meryl Streep and find her the best actress alive but this movie, in my opinion, fell flat and was far from my high expectations. I do not think that it was really the acting that was what made this movie in my opinion boring it was that this plot has been done to death from any and every angle a man and a woman fall in love but both are already married or one is married or one is married and gets caught. Sound familiar? So I say if you want a good Meryl Streep romance watch Out of Africa or The Bridges of Madison County.

I can only describe tracks like \\"ABC\\" & \\"I Want you Back\\" as simply joyous (as I describe most of Motown's music). I only have \\"Off The Wall\\" & \\"Thriller\\" on LP at this point and have felt for the time being that this collection is sufficient. That may change soon though I wasn't overly convinced about \\"Bad\\" or \\"Dangerous\\" upon their releases. I recall thinking upon the issue of the \\"Bad\\" video that Michael apparently took 5 years to remake \\"Beat It\\". Other tracks like \\"Heal The World\\" sounded like a limp re-write of \\"We Are The World\\", a little too sugary for my tastes..but that's me.  Having said that there is plenty of power and scope in the music and many new rules were re-written by MJ to set new standards in Pop/Funk music. Like many, I lament the omission of \\"Scream\\" with Janet Jackson, but \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\", \\"Man In The Mirror\\" to name but a few are now all radio classics. This collection really IS ESSENTIAL as it's title suggests.  We've now lost Michael. The sad thing is it took his passing to remind us all of how great an entertainer he was because for a really long time there it seemed his music had become a sad afterthought lost in the relentless tabloid reportings of his \\"bizarre lifestyle\\"..some of this was self-inflicted by Michael himself somewhat naively...most of it however wasn't.  All we have left now is the music...that's really all that matters in the end. RIP Michael Joseph Jackson ...entertainer par excellence.
B001GQACGO|4.0|I am not sure about you guys, but i simply love this album for some reasons.  I am not a big fan of Beyonce, but I was amazed by her music and vocals that she created in this album. Undoubtly, few very good/catchy songs like Halo, If I Were A Boy, Single Ladies, Sweet Dreams and ++ (check out the remixed album, Super!). A good very effort for her, if I may say so.
B001N18HOQ|4.0|The good about this deluxe edition its the DVD ,as everyone may already have Ten and the extra-songs...  So I will only rate the DVD      The DVD is great, the sound and image are great .... I took one star from the fact that they changed the concert format .... Where is rocking in a free world ? I know that Porch was a great ending... but why don't include it as an extra ?? What about the Oceans ending ?Why they cut of part of the song explanation? I really like Pearl jam and how their political engagement which it makes stranger this type of \\"censorship\\" on this concert
B0017ANAZO|4.0|Very enjoyable. Great Cast. The story is excellent and easy to relate to. This is a movie that is great to own so you can watch it over and over.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|This movie was overall great!!! The suspense, the plot and the character of Lisa. Oh my gosh! I was on the edge of my seat when i went to see this! I absolutely loved the movie! I didn't find any fault nor any scene that was boring or made me upset, i was entertained by it all! it got great when Sharon found out about Derrick's secret and she started showing hard emotions! Lisa is just this psycho!!! oh my gosh!!! she was just freakin crazy! All i can say is forget which of the actors u like, the whole movie was excellent! I enjoyed it so much!!!! and i can't wait to buy it! It would be nice to have a fullscreen version cuz i hate widescreen but watever, i'll hav the movie!
B0014YVC6W|4.0|...I was a little disappointed that they chose to use the 1080i resolution instead of going to full 1080p, which Blu-Ray is more than capable of handling.
B0000027I6|5.0|Art is truly brilliant when it captures a snapshot of reality, makes us look at it in new or insightful ways. The themes of this album capture the brash exhuberance of the Post Reagan/Thatcher world. Amused to Death is a lament for the collapse of progressive possibilities.     With bold strokes, Waters paints a picture many of us recognize as only too real. Peace and love are childish, idealist mantras of the naive 60s. Cold, calculating cynicism, selfishness and greed is the new, realist morality of the youth. Socialism is dead. Untramelled, unrestrained capitalism is triumphant. The market is God. War is entertainment. The mass media is our opium, as it juxtaposes and blends together news, entertainment, reality, fiction and propaganda, dulling our senses, inuring us against suffering and war, innoculating us against critical thought. We're all laughing even as we plummet towards environmental and economic catastrophe.    His lyrics are searing and comptemptous towards the forces that have brought us here - and no one is spared - from the Americans' casual indifference towards wars waged with smart bombs against anonymous blips on the screen in distant lands ('Bravery of being out of range'), to the bitter irony of Stalinists in China who, in the name of Mao and socialism, turned their guns on their own people in Tianamen square ('Watching TV'), to the hypocritical, debased, money-grubbing TV evangelists (What God Wants) to a vicious (but hilarious) dig at Andrew Lloyd Webber's pre-packaged pap (Its a miracle).     The title track is an obituary for a human race that has replaced decency and humanity, caring and compassion, feeling and empathy with a hedonistic culture of greed and consumption, of utter disregard of the consequences of our actions on other humans and the planet. The song shows us a bleak snapshot of the future where every last vestige of humanity has been sucked dry, where we relate only to commodities, human relationships are only of worth as economic transactions, and where the distinctions have become so blurred we can't tell which is which: \\"what is the heart life of color TV? What is the shelf life of a teenage queen?\\"    And it is all wrapped up in a operatic musical style Waters has been perfecting since Dark Side of the Moon. With an architect's ear for structure and form, and a poet's ear for melody, Waters creates an aural landscape of vivid drama, quiet reflective valleys and climatic, towering crescendos. All conveyed with a dynamism that sounds like raw emotion, free-flowing and unrestrained, almost anarchic, on the verge of escape, and yet, simultaneously, controlled with ruthless, exquisite, precision, down to the list twinkle of a pin drop or timing of a voice-over.     Waters has also finally found the perfect musical and lyrical match for his voice. Whereas he struggles with the earlier Floyd stuff, unable to match the range that was Gilmour's forte, this album was made for his voice (literally!). That grave, substantive, slightly gravelly voice is perfect for the ambience it creates here. Its like the whole story is being narrated by this wise, sad, angry father figure who looks down and shakes his head at the mess humanity has created, alternately empathatic one minute and shaking with rage the next.    18 years on and what is amazing is how Waters captured the zeitgeist of the 90s and how prophetic this bitter sweet album was.     As a work of art it must rate as one of the great accomplishments of the 20th century.     (PS I have to agree with another reviewer here, you'll never appreciate this album unless you turn off the lights, lie down and LISTEN. The lyrics are so evocative, the sound so realistic, the music so encompassing, the total experience is so vivid, that you'll \\"see\\" it play out in your head. And no, I wasn't stoned when I listened to it.)
0345495004|5.0|Loved this book.  My Paternal Grandmother was a Wright, and a relative, but I would have loved it anyway.  It was very well-written.
0307341569|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  This isn't the normal style of novel that I read, but I thought Sharp Objects was such a good book that I couldn't resist reading Gillian Flynn's next book.  I am always intrigued by an author that can conjure up such a dark plot...Flynn clearly did her homework on the subject matter and created very believable characters.
1416550542|5.0|This is a good story to add to your Summer reading list.<br /><br />It's the thoroughly engrossing story of a small child who is seemingly abandoned by her family at age 4, and spends a lifetime trying to reconstruct her personal history.<br /><br />The mystery unravels across continents (England, Australia), decades, and generations of descendants who piece together clues from old scrapbooks, old friends, and some good old-fashioned sleuthing.<br /><br />A lively, twisting plot keeps you turning the pages to the end, with the chapters rotating between the perspective of the small child who has grown up, her doting granddaughter, and the chapters of a book of children's fairy tales that hold the secret to her past.<br /><br />The book itself is like a fairy tale, and is reminiscent of Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Secret Garden, which was one of my favorite books as a child.<br /><br />Kate Morton is a fantastic storyteller; you'll feel transported between 1913 London, 1975 Brisbane, and present-day Cornwall - with detailed, period characters and landscapes all along the way.
B0010ZR160|1.0|This \\"production\\" where even the caterers are thanked in the credits, is pure rubbish. The use of profanity to get an R rating is such a cheap trick. The only worthwhile actor in the bunch of these unknowns is Morgan Freeman - but why would he associate himself with such a loser film? Casey Affleck has the worst possible diction, a lightweight voice that doesn't carry, and putting on an accent when he murmurs instead of speaks makes one believe the viewer has a hearing problem. It is hogwash in its purest form. STUPID, DUMB, PROFANE TO THE POINT OF DESECRATING JESUS CHRIST - well, Mr Ben Affleck the writer, how could you pen such filthy  abomination? Repenting won't cut it for you sir, and as you must have found out by now, no one will touch you with a hundred foot pole. Career: OVER. Same goes for you Jennifer, how can you and your kids applaud Daddy at the end of the day is beyond anything I can imagine.
B000W9DTG6|5.0|The three DVDs arrived in good condition in the specified time span; I liked that the 3 movies each had their own case as well as the attractive 3 case \\"binder\\" type package.
006123205X|1.0|i've read the book a few times, and had the whole unabridged version on CD rom.  both were wonderful to read and use.<br /><br />this was two discs long, and it seemed to miss the most important points of the unabridged versions.<br /><br />if i had not read the book before buying this, i never would have read the book at all, as there was no useful information on it.<br /><br />there is SO much to learn in the books!<br /><br />thus, i recommend someone purchase the entire book, or the entire unabridged edition cd, and not this shortened set.
B001PR0Y5S|5.0|Sandra Bullok, plays the role of a very tough Canadian boss working in NYC, who gets her Visa expired and has to be deported back to Canada. Being very desperate to stay in the US, she agrees with her male American assistant to marry him temporarily in order to escape the deportation process and then they will get divorced immediately after. They both visit an legal officer in order to make their marriage legal, who suspects that they are planning felony and tells them that he will make sure he finds the truth and gets them punished if they were marrying just to bypass the law.      The couple decides to spend the weekend with the assistant's family in Alaska. When Sandra meets his family for several days, she decides to call off the wedding and get deported, only for her assistant to surprise her with his admission of true love to her!     The story is quite original!     The film was light and funny!     I highly recommend it.
B0002I831S|5.0|The item was shipped and received promptly, and in the condition as stated by the seller.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.  Thanks!
B000002LLC|5.0|Just a different from the norm yet truly enjoyable compilation of electic, vintage-type tunes like ONLY The Material Girl can do justice.  Had let this true gem of a CD almost slip through my Madonna Registry-of-sorts but, thankfully, though, I didn't and can now say that I own ALL Things 'MUSICAL' Madonna.<br /><br />She is the ONE artist that can truly brighten my day just by the sound of her voice.  Some artists grab you the first time you hear them which is exactly what happened when I heard my First Madonna song.  Since hearing 'Holiday' in the early 1980's while working in my Parent's Front yard as a kid, I have been totally & unequivocably, 100% completely hooked.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|What a funny movie. This rates up there with Dumb and Dumber. Also a good soundtrack. If they could only make more movies like this instead of the steady stream of garbage we get as time goes by.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|This is an excellent collection that shows how and why their popularity exploded. They started as European favorites and quickly became World favorites.
0575083093|4.0|REVELATION SPACE (2000) is the first published novel by the now prolific Alastair Reynolds.   As I am new to his works I decided to begin at the beginning.  The book is long, edgy (even now in 2009), dark, and had enough plot and gizmos to keep me reading.  When time permits I'll get to other books by him.  If I were able to, but Amazon does not allow it, my rating would be 3-1/2 stars.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|I would only like possible stunts in my action films. Impossible stunts annoy me and make me mad. If I can't do it - no one can. I can't slide around holding a baby, shooting a gun - therefore it's impossible! I can't shoot a gun at a merry-go-round and make it spin - therefore it's impossible! I can't do battle while \\"getting it on\\" with my woman - therefore it's impossible! I can't even meet a woman - therefore it's impossible!<br /><br />I only want to see movies that are original and I only want to see things done in movies for the first time - making it the MOST original. I'd never own a movie because I would have to see something I've already seen more than once. Talking in a movie - seen it! Shooting in a movie - seen it! Babies in a movie - seen it! Carrots in a movie - seen it!<br /><br />Everyone says that Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars - well - I'll never know because I've already seen Phantom Menace and I don't need to see things I've already seen - because I've already seen it!<br /><br />I never want to see any action EVER in a movie unless there is a strong reason as to why that action is taking place! If someone stands up in a movie - I want there to be proper context and back-story as to know why that person is standing up. If there isn't - it's lame!<br /><br />I turned this movie off after 4-seconds (which I'm representing here with my 4-star review) because I've already seen what they were showing - and there was no proper context - and it made me so mad that I snapped the DVD in half and shouted at my television set for one-half hour!<br /><br />Good day to you!
1439157383|3.0|This was a really good book, however the sadness NEVER ended and then just got worse.  If you want an uplifting book DON'T buy this one.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I love Michael Jackson's music but this album was really overshadowed by \\"Thriller\\" and in complete candour it is as stupendous aor even better than \\"Thriller\\".  Every song is meaningful sagely written.  Long live the KING!
B000065VB0|5.0|What??? Phil Collins playing with no cymbals?<br />Or any drummer playing an entire song or recording with no cymbals?<br />Who really navigated and pioneered Genesis into an innovative art form  long before bubble gum pop music meant fame and fortune?<br />A brilliant dose of multi culturistic atmospheres and vocal patterns with the aid of creative musicians who can paint a musical statement when  they are guided with each dynamic vision.<br />The German version of this recording alone sends the current flock of  prog rockers, Christina Spears and Beyonce's back to their crib.<br />Back in 1982 my rock band performed And Through The Wire at the Hollywood Record Swap meet which at that time took place inside the Hollywood Palladium.<br />Everyone stopped and peered at us!!  Oh oh; we struck a nerve.<br />As cult a status as this album was upon its initial release, the album soon became imbedded and blew away the repetitive popped out new wave and punk scene within a few years.<br />And then Gabe himself and King Crimson toured!!<br />I will not analyze each track, for those of you who have listened to PG3,<br />you can clearly hear the texture and layering of vocals and instrumentation that reflects imagery as each song creates its own story.
B0012CH350|5.0|Well made, good quality and perfect fit.  I leave my grill out all year and this is a wonderful protector.
0061854549|4.0|I liked the book. The experiments the author describes a quite interesting. I would have skipped the chapter about the \\"sexual arousal\\"  experiment. It is not because it is pushing the limits but more because it  is so glaringly obvious. There are probably hundreds of jokes on the topic  which corroborate the conclusion of the experiment.    Also the experiments are performed on college students mostly which is not  a correct representative sample - but the author acknowledges this.  Overall a good read - my expectations were that this is a book written  by a Nobel price winner - I had confused the author with another behavioral economist who got a Nobel proce a couple of years ago.  Compared to the expectations I was a little disappointed - since I was expecting a Nobel price level book. But overall a good book.

B0028T6XXY|1.0|I love Michael Buble, but this DVD was a complete waste of money, I bought a concert, but got a lot of useless interviews with the behind the scene activity making the concert.  There were maybe 5-6 songs actually taken from the concert.  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!
B00000J7SS|4.0|4 1/2    Few discs can gracefully surpass complimentary adjectives \\"innovative\\" and \\"influential\\" like wind, in this often unrivaled thrust. The storm that brewed on these sessions still remains in many ways the most powerful study in extended, electrified free-form composition the modern era has known. And yes, there are a few indulgent pockets (particularly on the second disc, and particularly represented with Sanctuary) that exclude this double disc from obtaining an almighty perfect score, though at 1400+ mini-reviews attempting to pin down that \\"perfect\\" fix of a record, BB comes as close to spontaneously informed expressionism as I've yet to witness- a perfect aspiration in its own right.
B001N18HOQ|2.0|Just a quick note:  Not a big fan of Pearl Jam but willing to give this \\"classic\\" a go recently.  Song not bad, appreciate the work they put in for the remixed tracks...  Can't say which (remaster vs. remix) I prefer.    BAD part: These CD's are a sad example of the nasty loudness wars ([...]).  They sound horribly compressed and certain parts distorted on high quality sound systems.  Perhaps not a big issue with grunge but still wrong is wrong.    Easily 5/5 if they allowed the album to breathe with full dynamics.  As it stands - 2/5 since audio quality ESSENTIAL for a remaster..
0452289963|5.0|I'm almost 60 years old now. The very first self help/psychology type book I ever read was \\"TNT, The Power Within You\\" by Claude M. Bristol back when I was about thirteen. I've read over a thousand books since then and all of it has had to do with the human condition in one way or another, ninety percent of which has been in the same field. Eckharts book \\"A New Earth\\" is likely the most powerful book on why we are the way we are I've ever read. There is no fluff here.<br /><br />\\"The Power of Now\\" caused me to begin thinking in that interesting way about the present moment until one day I had my own insightful flash of being not just connected with everything around me, but that I WAS everything around me! I've never had this kind of experience from simply reading a book. So it was natural that I would read this one to see what else I could learn from this man. And I have to say this book gives the most revealing look at the inner workings of the ego and the games we play with ourselves and others that I've ever read.<br /><br />If you don't mind being called on your \\"stuff\\", read this book. If you want to wake up to your real life, read this book. If you want to get a real look behind the curtain of the human psyche and the crap we pull on ourselves and each other, read this book. In other words, if you're ready to experience the true power of who you really are, read this book.
B0020TS5LU|3.0|I've looked forward to seeing this wonderful film in Blu for the longest time.  Now that I have it I have to say that the picture quality is not at all good--in fact, it looks no better than DVD does on a decent DVD player.  Such an opportunity wasted.  And, I find I must keep my standard def version of this disc because none--that's right NONE of the excellent and informative special features from the SD version are on the Blu-ray version.  There are no special features at all!<br />This is a very underwhelming release of a best picture nominated film.  It deserved better. I didn't know how many stars to give it, but I'll say 5 star film, 1 star picture quality, so I gave it 3 stars.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I am very impressed with this receiver.  It plugs right in to the USB port, picks up signals almost instantly, and works great with every program into which I've plugged it.  Those programs include Maptech's Terrain Navigator, MS Streets & Trips (2008 - I returned my 2009 version), and National Geographic's Topo.  Setup in all of these programs was quick and easy.  The device itself has a little rubber pad on the bottom so it does not slide around on my dusty dashboard.  It is also magnetized so I can stick it on my roof.  It also comes with a little window suction cup, though I can't imagine ever needing it.  All in all, very ingenious.  The length of the cord has been more than adequate for any location (toward the front of the car) into which I have need to place it.  This receiver works exactly as advertised.  If you need a great laptop GPS receiver, this is the way to go.  Highest marks!!!

B002ASVYWS|5.0|First off, Karnivool's previous album, Themata, was a great album. It had quite the original sound that was hard to compare with other artists, and tricky, precise songwriting that everybody could have more of. I listened to the CD on repeat for days before I switched it out for something else, and even then, I ended up putting it back in because I wasn't finished! But at the same time, it came off at first as a fairly poppy album, and it took me a few listens to get over my progressive musical ego that poppy is fine when done right. So when I heard that Karnivool was working on a new album, I hoped that they would take a more-progressive route with the album, since Themata gave me the idea that they could definitely do that if they wanted.    Now we're a few years later, at Sound Awake. I've only had a chance to listen to it a couple times so far, but I already say that it's better than I had hoped! Karnivool has shed some of that poppiness in exchange for a bigger, more-lush style of songwriting that flows smoother and works the atmosphere much more than its predecessor. If you're a fan of progressive works, you will rejoice, because musically, this is definitely an \\"album\\" album, not just a good collection of songs (Themata was an album in that aspect too, though I wouldn't say as extensively). Every track compliments the album's integrity, and they flow together so smoothly, it'd probably be quite the different experience if you listened to the songs individually.    It's difficult for me to say which individual tracks are my favorites since I haven't listened to it much yet, though Deadman and Umbra are the first to come to mind. However, every track brings something new and creative to the table, and there aren't really any boring/uninteresting weak points to it. The negative reviews don't make any sense to me, I almost wonder if they listened to the wrong CD or something.    Certainly check this out if you're looking for an epic adventure of an album that will give you chills. Karnivool have created an album that with time, people will know and recognize, and probably set as the Karnivool standard (until they top it again, of course). Might it take a couple three listens to warm up to if you're expecting another Themata? Yup, definitely. But I came to the conclusion that it's better than Themata, so it was all worth it.
031606792X|5.0|I place this, the last book in the saga of Bella and Edward, almost on par with Twilight (the first book).  Throughout the story - books one through four - I could see how the author grew along with her story and that fascinated me.    As the Amazon review states: Great love stories thrive on sacrifice. And this saga is for me first and foremost a great love story, with all the intrigue and emotion that you could ask for or expect, and as the story rolls along, the author makes it into what she wants it to be.      Again, as this is fiction, I am weary of those reviews who push to make this \\"historically correct\\".  Each character in a book is the creation of the author and that author has sole and complete control over the evolution and growth )or non-evolution and non-growth) of each and every character. It is not up to an editor to re-write a story, surely?      Criticism always comes easily to those who cannot do.    Ms Meyer thank you for a truly lovely love story!

0307341550|2.0|As the readers are gratuitously reminded, Sharp Objects' 'protagonist' Camille Preaker is, as can be guessed by the title, a cutter who is deeply conflicted. Her job as a journalist in Chicago, to her chagrin, brings her a murder story from her humble hometown, Wind Gap, Missouri, which requires her to return for a brief stay to report on the murders. As is customary, her visit turns out to last longer than she expected and she, sooner or later, has to 'confront her demons'.     Unfortunately, the ability to predict the main character's compulsive habit from the title turns out to be a harbinger for the predictability of the novel in general. The ending can be easily surmised early on, which leaves the reader to struggle through chapter after chapter of relentless small town shenanigans and stupidity that quickly begin to test their patience. Every last character is annoyingly obtuse and oblivious, and the fact that they all swear, drink excessively, do drugs, or partake in one or more other forms of debauchery grows tiresome.     As mentioned before, the ending is quite forseeable, and, I might add, prosaic, not making the enervating process of reading the novel worth it in the end, as readers may hope. No significant revelations are made in the also aforementioned perfunctory 'confronting of demons', and the only thing \\"shocking\\" or \\"disturbing\\" about the novel, as so many critics raved passionately, is that the main character is as dense and, quite frankly, slow as she is. In short, Sharp Objects insults the readers' intelligence.    The only thing that drags the overly-praised novel up to my assigned rating of two stars is Gillian Flynn's evident talent. Flynn's figurative language and characterization are perfectly matched to the small town milieu and occasionally evoke emotion from the reader. I hope her writing aplomb is better fitted to a less contrived plot in her next novel.
0316044695|1.0|If you really aren't into the \\"War is Great\\" mentality, this book is a total waste of money.  Everyone is a TERRORIST - all the Iraqis are TERRORISTS, it's ok to blow people away because that is what SEALs do.  I had thought I was buying a really interesting in-depth special story.  I bought propaganda for the Bush torture regime.  If I could take the book back and get a refund, I would.  I made it about 100 pages and tossed it into the trash.    This is the first negative review I have ever written.  If you really aren't into the killing is fun and we made it legal type of thought process, don't waste your money.    It's a tribute to Bush and pure propaganda.  A total waste of time, money and words.
0307266303|3.0|This is a counterweight to all the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this book, which I bought without having been able to dip into it. It reminds me why I never buy a book normally without sampling the style. Like all marathoners I am always looking for ways to run more efficiently and there were a couple of useful tips in the book. There was also an awful lot of padding, describing the authors attempts to find the tribe I thought the whole book was going to be about.These sections in particular suffered from hyperbole and were intensely irritating.(Maybe it's an Australian thing: we don't do guts on the carpet like you Yanks.) The anthropological theory was interesting, but the dietary evidence was entirely contradictory to McDougall's previous chapter about ideal ultrarunning diet.    I would have borrowed it from the library, but I wouldn't have bought it.
1400063736|5.0|It's as if there was some poignant hybrid of Thornton Wilder's \\"Bridge Over San Luis Rey\\" and Doctorow's \\"Ragtime\\". It is a long, delicious beautiful journey that catches you completely by surprise and continues to thrill you long after you've finished. I was so caught up in it, I didn't realize how much time was passing, nor did I care. McCann creates a completely believable New York City circa 1974, populated by fascinating people who you come to feel you know, and NEED to know. And then, in a tour de force of literary precision, you jump 30 some odd years and end up shattered.  A must-read. One of the best novels of the last several decades.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Quick and yet effective!  If you want a good workout and you don't have a lot of time to fit into your schedule I would highly recommend this video.  Three different levels of workouts.  This might be only a 20 minute workout but it makes you sweat like you have worked out for an hour!  Definitely worth the money I spent.

0670020478|5.0|... this is a massively important book with the potential to shift humankind into a completely different phase of evolution. You think I'm kidding, but I'm not. And despite Ken Robinson keeping us all in stitches through the entire book (oh, how I would have loved a book-long podcast with him doing the monologue...), he continually drops the social bombs. We simply must look up. Or wait for doom. (Only half-kidding in this case.)
B000002KD5|5.0|I received the CD within just a week of ordering it.  Can't say anything but great things about this seller.  Thank you!!
1439157383|4.0|I am actually very confused. I read this exact book and then saw the movie today, and how is that a tie-in? For one, who is Aunt Kelly? In the book, it's Aunt Zanne. Why, in the movie, are they ridiculously rich, yet in the book, they are middle class? Why is Jesse such a softy in the movie, but a bad kid in the book? What happened to the relationship of Julie and Campbell? And what happened to the ending? Did the producers not even read the book? I know I should be reviewing the book, so the book is great. Just don't go see the movie, you'll be very confused.
1401923119|5.0|I wrote The Sacred Female, a novel of sexual love's power and transcendent sex.  [[ASIN:1425130488 The Sacred Female]]  Mostly based on experience with some cursory research, after publishing it, I continued my research into this field.  Dr. Lipton's work validates my own conclusions that sexual love positively impacts the human body at the sub-cellular level!  Of course, his work goes far beond my level of expertise, yet it lends credibility to my theories.  So, of course I loved the book!
0142000663|5.0|The old style presentation of the Centennial Edition was not what I expected, but it works.  The rough cut page edges are quite cool to look at, but the book (being new) holds together and has a shiny (sturdy) cover with fold out flaps to mark your place when reading ... so you get the best of both worlds - old and new - as you read.  The old style theme of the book presentation also helps to set the scene (by \\"visually\\" taking you back in time).  However, as you get into the story you realise you don't need this stage prop.  Steinbeck is a master of words and describes the characters and events in such detail that you are there suffering with them, or enjoying the small happy moments they manage to grasp as the travel to California.  This book was something we probably had to read as high school students and I somehow missed out.  So, it is with great pleasure that I can do so now when I am older and am mature enough to realise what a tragic story it is and can understand the real history it portrays so realistically ... but in a way that you still don't want to put the book down.  I totally recommend this book, and the Centennial Edition format is certainly a easy to read font and size to hold for the long periods you may want to keep reading it.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Great Movie! The characters all tied in perfectly. The twist with Uhura and Spock will spark attention for several more movies to come.  One negative comment though; in the original series Chekov was a sex symbol, resembling the lead singer in the band the Monkeys. In this 2009 movie, Chekov was horrible, really horrible. I've been a fan of Star Trek for 43 years. I've enjoyed every Star Trek but Enterprise (too much talking - much like a soap opera). This 2009 movie is incredible except Chekov left me cold. Why didn't the producers think about the characters' appeal to women? The original Kirk was always too much of a womanizer. [This Kirk, so far, is very appealing.] Spock was unattainable but soooo worth the effort.  McCoy was sexy in his own right as was Scotty and Chekov.   They messed up completely with Chekov 2009. He's such a kid - no appeal to women.I wish they'd replace him but they probably won't. I seem to be the only commentator to notice.
B001PR0Y5S|5.0|Don't much care for comedies but this was very good.  It isn't non-stop laughs but I found myself the next day where things would remind me of something in the movie and I would be laughing and saying to friends -- remember when....  It's an A++ for my taste.

031606792X|1.0|*Spoilers ahead*  There was only one hunting trip, one! I was looking forward to that more than anything, even if she never attacked a human.  Then the end felt un-resolved.  It's great that the final battle didn't happen, but when they started dividing up opponents I was really hoping Kate and Tanya were about to get revenge for their fallen sister.  Instead after pages of good-byes and preparing, Nothing happens.  It's not so much that nothing happens, but it did matter that it felt un-resolved.  On top of that I was hoping for at least a page of what they were doing next, or the next 50 or 100 years later, they don't say anything about it, and they couldn't have that much longer in Forks, One page of the both of them looking back on their time in Forks wasn't too much to hope for. It was annoying what happened with Bella's character, I mean, she did know that Edward did want her before she became a vampire, but she never thought she was pretty until afterwards, that's just stupid, he had always wanted her and it would have been nice for her to realize that before she became a vampire, plus yeah, she did feel a little shallow afterwards.  And Charlie's character became an idiot, it might have been nice drama to actually have to avoid him, or did have to tell him that she had died.  I did like the renesmee thing, except for the so unoriginal name, mixing both the first name, and the middle name, couldn't she have come up with something on her own.  At the end, I really just turned to looking for fan-fics to find something I enjoyed a little more than this book.  I loved the other books even though after New Moon, it did get annoying that Edward always said \\"Bella, love\\" all the time, but other than that I think it was good that she had - during Eclipse fallen for Jacob too and realized what she was giving up when she would no longer human. Oh and her \\"after car\\" during breaking dawn was silly too, didn't he realize he could give her a Real Motorcycle now.  That I bet she would have enjoyed, I thought the ferrari was silly on Edward's part. It was really annoying that event after event was just skipped, I know pg-13 rating and all, but still the sexual tension between Edward and Bella was better in Eclipse than it was in Breaking Dawn because Everything was skipped in BK. I know a lot of people thought it was really stupid of Edward to ask Jacob of the favor, but that was one thing I could see happening, after all, he was watching her die in front him, could he not want to try anything.  I also thought Bella could've had more than just a sheild, I mean, the voices when Edward was gone, the smelling blood in early twilight, the dreams, none of this was explained, I was kind of hoping there would be a little more that would explain these things too.  Just stamp Happily Ever After for everyone, and forget giving everything up for Edward, she doesn't give anything up but her mother, and they skip over that in the book too.  Of course, keeping Charlie turns him into an idiot, about the same thing that happens to Jacob.  And the night she becomes a vampire, Edward asks her what she's thinking, and her response is Esme's an artist, stupid.  Would've been nice for her to explain the hunt, or the waking up, or anything other than Esme's an artist.  I think that's all my ranting now.  I think, hehe.  However, I do think the movie will be better than the book, because what hurt this the most, was the missing sexual tension, and they can't just skip kissing in a movie.  I know some people are debating on whether or not they should show a honeymoon scene when the movie comes out, but I think they can go pretty far even at pg-13 so there really isn't any need to do more than that and still keep it pg-13, imo.  Still hoping for Midnight Sun.

B0015XHQTE|5.0|This set is a must for anyone who loves Dirty Harry. The set is packaged in a very elegant way. The movies inside it are most entertaining. My son, who has never seen a Harry movie before now walks around telling everyone \\"I know what you are thinking....\\". The contrast is slightly too dark for some reason in the movies, Otherwise, this set has no drawbacks.

0307454541|4.0|A superior mystery thriller set in contemporary Sweden.  Larsson combined a number of thriller elements - long buried family secrets, corruption, serial killers, and a savant-like central character - successfully.  The plot is quite elaborate, even far-fetched, but carried along well by above average writing and character development.<br /><br />Why has Sweden produced such a disproportionate number of successful mystery writers?  Older readers will recall the enjoyable Martin Beck series by Wahloo and Sjowall, Henning Mankell has recently been very successful and there a a good number of other Swedish mystery writers whose work has been translated.  Its also interesting that a number of these writers come, like Larsson, from a rather Leftist background.

1932100660|5.0|The China Study was one of the books referenced in my other nutrition-weight loss-health etc. readings. In summary: it was surprising to find that The Animal Protein, that meant to be a Savior Of Life, gave birth to liver cancer instead!? There is more: Animal Protein is even more cancerogenous then well known chemical - aflatoxin??!! Here you go.....two intriguing facts that will pull you through this book with so much more to learn. Now imagine the very people who accumulated so many health problem due to their carnivorous habits would be the very population to defend it's beloved treat.<br />When  I am talking with my clients during sessions (massage sessions, oops) there are division of opinions: some totally reject the plant-based food idea, some listen but disoriented in what to eat... Mostly they would  love to hear from the doctors themselves  that one pound of spinach contains the same amount (just much better quality ) of protein that meat does (minus hormones and antibiotics and plus vitamins and minerals). And that is exactly not happening.....There are only a few doctors (published authors) such as John McDougall, Caldwell Esselstyne, Joel Fuhrman, Gabriel Cousens ( and not so many  more M.D.s) who have chosen to use diet as a healing modality instead of drug . They do provide education, cooking classes, psychological explanation of food versus emotions, etc.  And that is because majority of American allopathic physicians have very little or no knowledge on the subject of Nutrition. Their education was limited to couple of hours until now. Physician Committee for Responsible Medicine created a text book for a new generation of our doctors..... There is a light at the end of this very long and sad tunnel.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Great tv series. A melodrama about Vampires and other creatures interacting openly (sometimes) with people today. Very interesting and definitely adult entertainment. Top class acting.
0446343129|5.0|The Sugar Blues<br />Sugar in tobacco was more poisonous then tobacco iself.<br />It is engaging (and horrifying in times) reading that brings you through the history of New Worlds exploration, Modern Wars,  and Alcohol  industry. There are many surprising facts on nutrition versus diseases like bubonic plaque, scurvy.<br />I have learned that Lime is not equal Lemon (hens vitamin C content). It was painful to read about Dr. Wiley story where he fought for society's health and lost the battle.  The funny part how Refined Rice, that meant to help in fighting  Communism in Vietnam (!!!!) almost sabotaged this  \\"Great American War\\"....( Rice, that is stripped of it's skin  is becoming a poison (as refined carbs do)). And, sadly enough, the war for health is greatly compromised in our minds despite so many books. So many people willing to ignore the facts just to save the Hamburger. Imagine the \\"Sugar blues\\" being quoted every 10 minutes on TV commercial instead of Carls Junior Cheeseburger...with the sexy young girl in the gold bikini....that the effect we want....just dreaming.

B001D08SK0|3.0|I read the criticism (primarily of the packaging) of the 50th Anniversary edition by Miles Davis. The packaging is not good. The cd/dvd inserts is a good idea but it was not thought through. I love the blue vinyl and I think the hardcover book is very nice. The other items are unmemorable. The extra tracks are hit or miss, mostly miss. I haven't watched the dvd. The pictures are printed poorly and not worth a 2nd look. Still I think the record is very nice and sounds great.
B000VEA30W|5.0|well, it was a great price, came just as described, although there was a a small crack in the case, but that doesn't really matter. all in all, it was a great deal!
B000EGF0B4|5.0|Having failed to see this film for 3 1/2 years, I am amazed - both by the powerful content and the stunning delivery.<br /><br />The moving and unresolved romance between Ennis and Jack runs like a tumor through the life and family of each man, bringing into sharp focus the accumulating destruction of double lives and the cultural requirements that fertilize them, even in cases where the hidden life is mostly un-materialized.<br /><br />Astoundingly experiential, the film depicts a romance without any labels/identifications/etc often found in coverage of gender and sexuality. My perception is that both Ennis and Jack \\"are\\" bisexual, but find wide disagreement on this question with various critics claiming they are straight, bisexual or gay. Similarly, we experience the circumstances of Jack's death as a feared uncertainty rather than something we can attach a label to (\\"accident\\", \\"hate crime\\", etc). This stylistic approach reinforces the power of the story by letting us feel the excruciating uncertainty of a life that is loved but cannot be shared.<br /><br />Otherwise, the natural scenery is unbelievable, beautiful mountains, animals, rivers, men (!), etc.<br /><br />Watch this film!
B0017TFLBQ|4.0|Great price and delivery.  This was purchased for my nephew, after his original game wore out.  He gives the game two thumbs up.

0316017922|5.0|This books is about successful people versus people who rated this book with 1 star, i.e. apparently intelligent and knowledgeable people, but who never made it.     As the author says, this book is not yet another book that will teach you how to become a millionaire and super happy person in 24 hours. It is merely another view at the success, a view from the outside, how things that we have no control off might shape up our professional destiny.    While numerous books were written about the personality, intelligence, skills and habits of successful people, not many were written about the circumstances outside control of a person, such as year or even month of birth, economic situation, how one was raised, etc. This book covers that and provides an alternative view, with a series of well written and interesting examples.

B001W63DX2|4.0|I didn't wath the movie yet.  The song selection of the show is good and each song is played in a different city so the ambiance if different for each song, however we don't see Bruce talk a lot between the song so the ambiance is not like in a show integrally recorded.

B000002G9S|5.0|What an underrated band! I know there was a lot of bickering in the band and they had some conflicting personalities, but they sure produced some great tunes. Too bad that Kossoff died so young, what a talent. Besides the title track and of course \\"All Right Now\\", \\"Mr. Big\\" and \\"Remember\\" are my personal favorites. A great CD all the way through. Just put it in and sit back and enjoy.

B0024F08UG|4.0|***Update:    Now I've seen this blu ray I want to agree with all the above reviewers that rate the PQ and SQ - it's absolutely the best I've seen Towering Inferno on any home presentation format.  I'm viewing on a 100\\" screen projected by a Marantz VP-11S2 and fully implimented surround system, all fully calibrated.  Yep it's brilliant.    Still not quite the ultimate edition that I detail below, but probably the best we will get.    The only remaining better way to experience Towering Inferno would be to watch the road show 70mm blow up version on a giant screen in a cavernous theatrical hall... Maybe one day I can privately hire the biggest screen I can find for a one off to recreate that experience of so many decades ago...    Of course, until we see the next home video re-release in a home version of 4k digital cinema...    ***      This is a pre-release review on the possible content of the Blu Ray...    It has been suggested that this is the \\"Ultimate\\" home version of Towering Inferno.  Is it really...?    As a fan of the film since it was first shown in the cinema in the seventies, I've been waiting for the \\"Ultimate\\" home version since home ownership of films started with Super 8mm film.    Towering Inferno was first available for the home as 6 reel 8mm film digest version.  I still have a copy of that release as a rare collectors item.  I also have the complete John Williams soundtrack on LP record from the seventies.  Since then there has been multiple releases on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD.  I've owned some of these release except VHS.  Have these been \\"Ultimate\\" releases? No.    Now comes the Blu ray version.  Will it be the \\"Ultimate\\" release?    The \\"Ultimate\\" release would give the viewer the option to watch the regular 35mm scope version AND the 70mm blow-up roadshow version!  The 70mm roadshow version has some subtle differences in edits and soundtrack.  It also had an intermission at a cliff hanging moment.  I liked the music cues much more in the roadshow version and found the surround sound of 70mm version(called 6 track stereophonic upon theatrical release) much more emersive. (I think the 35mm scope version was only a mono track which was rechanelled to create stereo and weak surround for previous home versions).    Let's hope this is Blu Rau really is the \\"Ultimate\\" edition and includes the 70mm roadshow version...if it is I'll give it 5+ stars!    Cheers

My six year old had left his copy at Great Grama's the year before and actually remembered it when he saw her again a year later.

How wonderful that there is a story where the struggle pays off in the end with a happily ever after.

B001NXBRJG|5.0|The Matrix 10th anniversary edition blu-ray disc & book are a great product. I was unaware of the fact that the disc would be accompanied by a book of pictures. It is simple enough and nice to have since I loved the movie anyway. The quality of the blu-ray disc is excellent! I have a 42-inch LG LCD TV and a Sharp Blu-ray disc player. The play is great and picture quality is fabulous. For all the special effects, this disc captures it all. The extras or special features are unfortunately in the lower quality of picture.

I understand why it is required because of the cultural points but I cannot say I enjoyed reading it.  I read certain chapters then i would read the corresponding spark notes and it would make a lot more sense. Good luck fellow summer readers! :)
0385751893|5.0|It is light. It is funny. It is deep. It is sad. It is dark. It is serious. It is naïve. It is simple. It is complex. It is tragic. It is all of these, and much, much more.

1400063515|1.0|To his credit, his two books are selling very well. Fooled by Randomness is #2986 and Black Swan is #104 on Amazon.  There were 400+ reviews on them. Many people do not like his writing or his ego, or whatever....<br /><br />My PhD thesis in Chemical Physics, used least-squares-fit model, employing Schrodinger equation to match the 20,000 spectral lines of Lithium molecule, on the IBM mainframe. The model is definitely not Gaussian.<br /><br />If you do MBA or PhD work in Physics, Chemistry, Statistics, Finance, Math, Engineering, Social Science..., you already know that Gaussian bell curve is the normal distribution. There are hundreds of non-normal ones, Taleb called them Black Swan. It is a great title to sell books.<br /><br />The book has shown his ego, everywhere. He bashed everyone, and yet he contradicted himself on many pages.<br /><br />Top three of the ten principles for a Black Swan-proof:<br /><br />1. What is fragile should break early while it is still small. Nothing should ever become too big to fail. Evolution in economic life helps those with the maximum amount of hidden risks - and hence the most fragile - become the biggest.<br />2. No socialization of losses and privatization of gains. Whatever may need to be bailed out should be nationalized; whatever does not need a bail-out should be free, small and risk bearing. We have managed to combine the worst of capitalism and socialism. In France in the 1980s, the socialists took over the banks. In the US in the 2000s, the banks took over the government. This is surreal.<br />3. People who were driving a school bus blindfolded (and crashed it) should never be given a new bus. The economics establishment (universities, regulators, central bankers, government officials, various organizations staffed with economists) lost its legitimacy with the failure of the<br />system. It is irresponsible and foolish to put our trust in the ability of such experts to get us out of this mess. Instead, find the smart people whose hands are clean.<br />  ---------------------<br />  I corrected his spelling of organisation, to organization. His speaks French, oui, oui oui. His French writing is probably better than English. On #3, how do we find the smart people whose hands are clean?<br /><br />Taleb's PhD adviser, Benoit Mandelbrot of U Paris examined thousands of time- series data sets from many countries since 1950. None of these data sets was normal. The normal distribution is a special case of the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution (CL), named after Augustin Cauchy and Hendrik Lorentz. CL is a continuous probability distribution.<br /><br />In 2008, Universa funds (managed by Spitznagel, as Chief Investment Officer, and advised by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, as Senior Scientific Advisor) scored returns of over 100% from the global financial meltdown.  Is this credible?<br />I could not find this info from Hedge Fund or Forbes, or any other source.<br /><br />Look at the Universa website, you get UNIVERSA INVESTMENTS L.P., 1414 2nd Street, Santa Monica, CA 90401, phone 310.566.5560, fax 310.566.5561. But nothing on their client portfolio or investment strategy.<br /><br />The fact the Taleb is famous on CNBC, Wall Street Journal, media circuits, attracted many new investors to sign up with Universa in 2008 and 2009.  Investing in the long tails, CL, non-Gaussian?  This is just pure sales-talk and gimmick.<br /><br />Taleb is a professor that projects his clean-hands image. Hedge fund is not regulated. Taleb and Spitznagel do not have to disclosure anything. Non-disclosure hedge fund is one of the major causes of the 2008 meltdown.<br /><br />If you invest with Universa or Taleb, be careful. Universa claimed it made 100% return in 2008. Therefore you automatically assume that you will make money when you invest with Universa, Gaussian theory. But if you lose money, it is due to Black Swan.<br /><br />Is Taleb the \\"smart and clean-hand\\" person in finance?  He is better than most Nobel economists. Why?

159448385X|5.0|This is a work of fiction which is beautifully woven using many threads of both harsh and loving reality. I cannot believe that it could be possible for any reader to get through this book without shedding a tear. I shed many.    It is about the collision of the life-paths of two women who come from very different family backgrounds, but become the wives of the same, cruel husband in Kabul. They form an unlikely, strong, and loving, alliance.     The story takes us through over three decades of recent Afghan history, through the many ruling regimes and conflicts during those times, and the consequences of what is termed as collateral damage suffered by many during the battles between the many factions involved.    You must read this book. For those who are familiar with many of the cultural and individual personality variations to be found in all the peoples of the world, you will still discover more amongst these pages. For those who believe the single, simplistic view of Muslim society that the western media portray, this book will be a huge revelation. However, many of those people would rather bury their heads in the sand. Those people should overcome their fear, and drag themselves into the opening pages of this book. I can guarantee that they will be quickly captivated, and they will soon be shedding tears with the rest of us.

B001V9LRTM|4.0|I mistaken ordered this item twice and had to pay a 50% repacking fee.  The blu-ray is great!!!!!
B001XJEKGC|5.0|Great music never gets old! The music on this CD was first produced 35 to 40+ years ago. But it is timeless. As it is presented on this DVD, It was better than I remember it.  Two musical geniuses, great music! The only way to enjoy this anymore is to see it live!
B00123KF54|4.0|The trio C, S & N was formed by members from the Byrds, The Hollies and Buffalo Springfield - and consequently hailed as a supergroup on their formation in 1969. This is the group's debut album and though a couple of songs may appear slightly dated, it's always a pleasure to listen to their trademark vocal hamonies.<br /><br />All bandmembers were songwriters, but on this album it's Steven Stills'  songs that stand out. The terrifix opening \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" simply has it all; great melodies, beautiful harmonies and great production - no doubt that Stills was also the driving force in the production of the album.<br /><br />The other Stills stand-out is the beautiful acoustic \\"Helplessly Hoping\\" - and \\"You Don't Have to Cry\\" is almost as strong.<br /><br />Stills also wrote the soulful closing track \\"49 Bye-Byes\\"<br /><br />Among the bonus-tracks is an early demo-version of \\"Do For The Others\\", with harmony vocals from Graham Nash - another great song.<br /><br />Graham Nash from the Hollies wrote the single \\"Marrakesh Express\\", which is quite nice, but not much more. Nash also wrote \\"Pre-Road Downs\\", one of the most rocking tracks on the album. \\"Lady of the Island\\" is Nash third contribution to the album - a quite acoustic ballad, not unlike some of his later Hollies songs like \\"Fifi the Flea\\".<br /><br />David Crosby wrote two songs and co-wrote one for the album. The strongest is \\"Wooden Ships\\" ( co-written with Stills and Paul Kantner ) - great chorus on that one.<br /><br />\\"Guinevere\\" is a typical Crosby song - nice, but molodically slightly vague - could have been an outtake from \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\".<br /><br />The soulful \\"Long Time Gone\\" also has a nice chorus.<br /><br />The trio expanded with Neil Young on the next album, \\"Deja Vu\\", giving the group more edge, which may be missed at places on this one.
1439157383|5.0|Clever, well written and while most of the time a real tear jerker, it suprisingly has a lot of action/suspense. She tackles very unique and complex issues, as she does in all of her books. They make you wonder about the issue she has written about, and make you want to talk about it with someone. That is trully getting your opinions out there in an indirect non-offensive way. Great work!
B0017CW5J4|1.0|the complex tour is better, this one doesn't even rate, what a disapointment.  I've seen the tour, I've seen them in Vegas, this isn't even close to the complex tour,  the new broads suck,  these blue men should turn in their blue badges,

B00005JM02|5.0|I just wanted to let some parents know that although this is absolutely one of our daughter's favorite shows, on days that she watches it, she wakes up screaming in the middle of the night.  We are not sure if it is one of the  scenes or if it is the concept of getting lost that bothers her.  Just a little FYI that what your child watches can correlate with nightmares or certain behaviors.
B001AVCFK6|2.0|What a fast paced action adventure sci-fi film this is. And with a unique plot - Earth threatened by a dark suited bald headed villain in a dark powerful ship. No, I'm not reviewing Nemesis. But the Earth threatened part is unique- right? Let's see - Star Trek I, II, IV, etc. Well at least the use of the time travel aspect is unique - ok we won't go there.    At least it keeps the Gene Rodenberry vision of Star Trek true - a future where mankind has cast away money and other less noble pursuits to venture into space as explorers seeking knowledge and other alien cultures. Anyone still got the impression that this was the culture behind this Star Trek - like from our first glimpse of Jim Kirk who trashes antique cars, bars and himself to prove he is just a misunderstood rebel who lost his father too soon and had to find a way to deal with life's injustices. The shallow and stereo-typical writing would not have James Dean turning over in his grave - he'd be puking in it. Instead of looking like a complex person wise before his years, James Kirk comes off a brash snot-nosed empty headed brat. Such stuff are heroes made of in this universe.    The rest of the characters aren't much better leading one to conclude they were written and assembled for one purpose - to attract a younger generation in a calculating and callous way. It's a shame that they think so little of thier audience that they figure they won't realise how empty and void this Star Trek universe is.    As for the movie, it's fine as long as you check your brain in at the door and overlook the huge plot holes. Let's see - Spock miscalculated and does not destroy the expanding star. Yeah that's happened before. Then how about going back in time (he's only done it a few dozen times already) and getting it right. If anything seems really forced for shock value, it was the destruction of Vulcan - as if this needed to happen to give this movie significance.    The ending was the real low point. To ask anyone tobelieve that an ensign with only one mission on a starship would be immediately promoted to captain - it makes me wonder just how well this version of Star Fleet functions.    In the end I prefer to think that there are many parallel universes out there. In one of them Spock blows up the star in time and Vulcan still exists as well as Gene Rodenberry's hopeful viewpoint of our future. I'll wait for a movie about that Star Trek.     [...]    A few final comments -  After watching the original series in blu ray I realized in this new universe none of this happens. If the writers have so little imagination that they could not figure out new ideas for stories in the original series universe, how long do you think it will be before this is true in this new less evolved universe. Already they are talking about revisiting The Wrath of Khan - so much for new directions.
B001HN697M|5.0|I was pleased with the packaging of this movie.  It is a wonderful story and I really enjoyed it.  I recommend it to anyone.  It completed my Trilogy collection.

B00297FEUS|5.0|This is a great album to re-release, this is how I remember it growing up only crisper and clearer. Not sure what all the complaints are about bad mastering, my CDs sound great. The new song \\"30\\" is worth the price of the album, these guys have the potential to still make great music. Sure they went a little off track with \\"Come out and Play\\" and as much as I have heard \\"Love is for Suckers\\" bashed, I think that album had some great songs on it. So I'm looking forward to new and great things and I hope I get the chance to see them Live.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Definitely worth it for bluray! Picture looks incredible, but the sound could have been better. Plus there's 30 extra minutes of additional footage. To be honest I don't think it helps nor helps the movie, but it's a nice bonus. If you like Final Fantasy VII, this is a no brainer.
0061231401|5.0|I've been a fan of Rollins' work for quite some time, especially the gripping Sigma Force series so I was pretty excited when I heard a new one was about to drop.  When I read the inside of the jacket I said to myself 'this is going to be GREAT' and I wasn't disappointed!<br /><br />Rollins has a lot of balls in the air with this one.  Genetically modified crops, ancient history dating back to the Egyptians and encompassing the early roots of England's history, civilization, and religion...shadow organizations, betrayal, action.  Never once does the book get bogged down in any one aspect though, and never does it become hard to follow.  That's a testament to how well Rollins can handle an involved plot.  The reader never loses track of the multifaceted plot and locales and the many characters involved in the book.<br /><br />I won't get too much into the plot because you can read it in the editorial blurb at the top of this very page as well as reading the inside of the book's jacket.<br /><br />All of the characters you should be familiar with by now are here. Gray, Kowalski, Painter, Monk and a couple others that I won't spoil because you may want to be a little surprised ;)<br /><br />This book is MASSIVE in scope starting with a crop experimentation site gone wrong in Africa and leading to many adventures on many different continents in several countries; the USA, Italy, Norway, England, France.  It's just a glob hopping adventure that never misses a beat.<br /><br />The characters are great, the dialogue is fantastic, the writing is always fun to read and engaging and the action is frenetic, but the plot is never sacrificed or short changed just to throw in action scenes.  In other words, it's just another great James Rollins book and another wonderful installment of the Sigma Force series.  And one of the most intriguing things about the plot?  After getting into it it may sound far fetched but it's frighteningly true to life.<br /><br />Doomsday Key is just another example of why I've loved James Rollins' work since I picked up Subterranean all those years ago.  Fun, fast paced, intelligent and a scarily plausible plot.  FANTASTIC!' work since I picked up Subterranean all those years ago.  Fun, fast paced, intelligent and a scarily plausible plot.  FANTASTIC!

015206396X|5.0|I fully admit to picking this book up for the gorgeous cover originally. Then I placed in my pile of TBR and forgot about it for a few weeks. I picked it up again this past week and read straight through it in two nights. The story moves along, each new plot thread blending with the previous ones so that you're not certain when (or if) something ended.<br /><br />The book itself is divided into two parts. Part One, 'The Lady Killer', focuses mainly on establishing our main character of Katsa and what her Grace entails, as well as her relationships because of it. Even though Katsa is eighteen years old, she acts in a much more mature fashion and thinks in a more complex way. Katsa also struggles with a growing conscious of what she has been doing as her Uncle, the King's, strong arm enforcement. If he has a petty problem with some minor Lord, he sends Katsa to handle the matter. In this way he manages a fairly peaceful kingdom.<br /><br />Part Two, 'The Twisted King', takes us away from the familiar geography of the first part and has us following where Katsa goes. Throughout this part we learn a bit more of how Katsa thinks and her motivations, as well as more about her companion's motivations and thinking. Though in the first part Katsa has a secret society of do-gooders (The Council, which tries to right wrongs throughout all Kingdoms, but not necessarily to the benefit of the ruling King), and had bent the rules in regards to other orders given to her by her Uncle, she had never truly been free to do as she liked.<br /><br />The relationship between Katsa and Po is obviously more then Katsa realizes. It takes several hearty blows--in the first part and later in the second--but the bond between the two is so strong its hard for Katsa to ignore.<br /><br />Our villian, King Leck, actually isn't a paramount threat until about a third to half way through the book. His machinations are felt from the first chapter, but his threat level only becomes clear after a string of unrelated events finally makes sense.<br /><br />Fire is set 30 years prior to the events of Graceling and will be due out in September of 2009. She is currently working on the sequel to Graceling, set 6 years later and featuring Bitterblue as the main character.es sense.

0385720920|4.0|Liked it, but I am ok with not reading it again. I was a quick read.
0765350386|5.0|I won't lie, there were times I was thoroughly exasperated with our lead female Vin--I understood that she was very cautious and almost paranoid because of her background as a street skaa (skaa means 'slave', though also denotes the slaves' race to a certain extent), but even when she made a step forward (good or bad) it seemed she'd take a few feet back. Her progress showed however in such subtle ways that I gradually began to ignore that personality quirk.<br /><br />At the beginning of each chapter, and later in the book's 'content', we are given a short snippet of a traveler's logbook. We don't learn until much later in the book that the snippets we have been reading are from the current ruler's travels before he became The Lord Ruler (demi-god), but like the characters who are reading the logs we're left with a sort of 'Huh?' reaction. The man depicted in the book is so doubtful and hesitant that imagining him as the cruel, merciless and arrogant Lord Ruler takes a lot of imagination. True this was 1,000+ years ago and history is written by the 'winner' so to speak, but to go from 'Am I truly worthy of the title Hero of Ages' to Oppressor and Murderer of millions its awe-inspiring.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most however was the plots within plots element. Few of the characters play their whole hand before the end, and even then many have plans that won't take effect for some time yet. In particular Kelsier was a schemer and manipulator. The few times he let's himself wonder what it would be like to have all the power in the Final Empire at his disposal, you can tell from his line of thought that he worried he'd end up like the Lord Ruler. When he let himself look past the hatred he felt for him, he could understand very clearly how a man could become so power-hungry.<br /><br />The Allomancy used by Vin, Kelsier and the others was a thoroughly engrossing idea. An Allomancer 'burned' metal in their bodies (ingested metals), and depending on the metal they could become stronger, keener senses or the ability to alter someone's feelings. The series title, Mistborn, refers to those who can burn all 10 (known) metals and have access to all 10 abilities. Though rare they are not so unheard of as to make the fact Vin and Kelsier are both Mistborn seem ridiculous.senses or the ability to alter someone's feelings.

B000L3CHC0|4.0|This watch has received many compliments, it looks more expensive than it is.  As watches go, it is the opposite of the Movado, and definitely not of the diver/rolex wannabe crowd- it is unique.  The case is thick, the band is thick.  The face is large but not as large as the latest fashion watch faces.  It is definitely a masculine heavy watch.  The case has been easier to scratch the case than I like, it is a nice looking watch but not for all occasions.  The case design is slightly art deco in my opinion.
B0026JWDQW|2.0|Was waiting on the edge of my seat for Paolo's second album but I'm sorry to say it was not as good as the first. Totally different sound to it. He has a great voice but sounds like someone else on some of the songs!! Would still buy the third one though!!!

B001NFNFNU|5.0|Changeling / B001NFNFNU<br /><br />While it is often said that absolute power corrupts absolutely, there is a human tendency to want to hand as much power as possible to the people that we expect to protect us. \\"Changeling\\" reminds us forcefully that powerful people do not need to be overtly evil, corrupt, or malicious to abuse that power - garden-variety stubbornness, prejudice, and stupidity will do just as well.<br /><br />The fact that this is based on a true story makes this powerful drama all the more terrifying. Christine Collins is a single working mother, coping cheerfully with all the prejudices that immediately glom onto that title. Her son goes mysteriously missing one day and she enlists the help of the police, terrified but always very polite and submissive to authority. After several months of embarrassing failure to solve the case, the police produce a child and insist that he is the missing boy. Christine is immediately certain that this child is not her son, based on major physical and emotionally indicators, but she submissively takes the boy home, hoping to reason with the police, who seem constantly on the verge of bullying her. She quietly collects signed statements from dentists, school teachers, and neighbors while the police go on the attack, sending a hired psychologist to diagnose the mother as 'disturbed' and refusing to listen to her concerns. When a local politically active pastor uses his influence to get media attention to Christine's treatment, the police preemptively lock her in an asylum against her will, and subject her to regular, inhumane \\"treatment\\" in an effort to coerce her to sign a statement absolving them of responsibility.<br /><br />\\"Changeling\\" has so many messages that they can hardly be contained in one movie, and yet like the protagonist, the movie is never pushy about its point. It simply is presented, quietly and firmly, and it is left to the viewer to take what they will. In many ways, \\"Changeling\\" shares the same space as [[ASIN:B0011HOEY4 American Gangster]], as a stunning example of how terribly wrong things can go when the people charged with protecting us decide to abuse that power. In other ways, \\"Changeling\\" is the sister movie to [[ASIN:B00026L9CU Iron Jawed Angels]], highlighting the sexism that underscored so much of the medical and professional attitudes towards women at the time, including how easy it was to lock women up as 'hysterical' and how a single mother is assumed to be 'easy' and more interested in other men than in providing a life for her child. And yet I cannot emphasize enough that these messages in \\"Changeling\\" are never pushed on the viewer - this is a movie with a great deal to say, and yet it says it so calmly and softly that we almost strain to listen. That takes a soft touch, something rare in Hollywood these days.<br /><br />Something else must be said in terms of the acting in \\"Changeling\\": it's superb. Truly, every actor in every scene does a wonderful job, and Jolie and Malkovich in particular shine. Ironically, the addition of Malkovich adds a probably-unintentional depth to the movie in that I kept waiting on pins and needles for him to turn out to be a 'bad guy' (a role he plays so very well and frequently), using Christine for his own agenda. I say 'ironic', because it occurs to the viewer later in the movie that whether he is using Christine is less important to whether Christine can get some use out of him - a layer of realism that I appreciated, for most real-life situations are naturally symbiotic, not good-guy/bad-guy driven.<br /><br />I cannot recommend \\"Changeling\\" enough for a terrifying look at the abuses of power and, really, as a nice eye-opener the next time someone says that \\"people have too many rights\\" or that it's \\"too easy to sue\\". Reasonable people can disagree as always, but it takes a movie like \\"Changeling\\" to impress upon us that sometimes the people we pay to protect us, protect only themselves.<br /><br />~ AnaMardollMardoll

B000002X1O|5.0|I always loved this album from when it first came out. Craig Chaquico, the young guitar wizard at the time, plays some excellent licks. Jerry Garcia plays wonderfully as he did most of the time! (He had his bad days playing live as most musicians do.) All the other players, Frieberg etc. fit right in and made a masterpiece that went unnoticed for a lot of people. This is spacey, rocking, and flowing throughout. And the reviewer that said it was poorly remastered...well, I have to disagree. The sound was clear enough to me!     It is now a shame that it is out of print. I don't think that will stay that way as good music has a way of coming back.

B00164KYV4|5.0|I rented this movie here on Amazon.com.  I loved it so much that I watched it twice and then went back and bought the DVD.<br /><br />The movie was so funny. The other reviewers have already talked about the plot of the movie so I won't go over that again.<br /><br />But if you've ever had a friend tell you about her date and then ask you why he hasn't called, then you will definitely identify with this movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This DVD was more than I expected. I love how on the cover it has like a 3D Jack face on it. The movie itself looks greaton any tv. And I absoulouly love the extra part for the computer so I can pitot on my iPhone or iPod and even just watch it from my computer.<br />Awesome idea.
B00004RF9B|4.0|very good picture quality, not alot of extras.  There is a newer anversary edition that has more extras.
B000AYQJ3I|4.0|This cd still stands up to time; the music is sweet and classic.  (We really did look like that, once upon a time.) The performers were great, definitely delivering their best that night. Even an obviously stoned Clapton provided a solid performance.  There's a warmth to the whole concert, probably because the performers themselves appreciated the higher purpose.  I purchased this cd along with A Concert For George, which makes for interesting comparison.  In fact, after viewing the latter cd, I had a greater appreciation for the earlier concert.

1416550542|2.0|The Forgotten Garden reads more like a 552 page first draft than a finished novel.  To be brief, the story is convoluted and the characters are one dimensional at best.  Morton does a better job describing places and things than she does describing the inner workings of the human mind and human motivation.  Ultimately, I'm glad that I finished this book--there were small portions that I really enjoyed.  Kate has a lovely (if not long winded) way with words.  I hope for her next book, the publisher hires someone to help make the story a little more cohesive.

B000031EGV|3.0|I couldn't wait to see JUMANJI when it first came out in the mid-Nineties.  A magical board game that brings the wilds of the jungle to life?  Action, mayhem, and special effects?  Robin Williams?  Sign me up!<br /><br />Yet I walked away from the theater disappointed with this movie; and the other day after viewing it on cable my disappointment hasn't wavered.  While some scenes were certainly exciting and entertaining, for the most part JUMANJI was annoying--from David Alan Grier's (who added nothing to this film) wrecked police cruiser, to Robin Williams's \\"poor me\\" sappiness, to Kirsten Dunst being an irritating smart aleck, to a young Bradley Pierce whimpering with monkey makeup on.  Yuck.  And the special effects. . .let's just say CGI has come a long way since the last decade.  No, the monkeys and spiders and bats and elephants and the lion and rhinos did not look real.  And what, pray tell, was the point in playing this (terrifying) game in the first place?  Games are played for fun--not to teach near-lethal life lessons.<br /><br />Now the good.  Jonathan Hyde was fun to watch in his dual role as Williams's father/hunter-protagonist; and Bebe Neuwirth is always easy on the eye, no matter what the venue.  And I liked the juvenile, bawdy, irreverent orneriness of the game board itself; in many ways it was the best character in JUMANJI, and kept the movie from rolling snake eyes.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I stumbled on this series on PBS totally by accident while channel surfing one night.  I was immediately drawn in to the premise and hooked after the first few minutes.  If you loved the A&E miniseries with Colin Firth and are an Austen and/or P&P fan, this DVD is a must!  I honestly haven't enjoyed a movie so much in ages.  The script is clever and witty and full of inside jokes.  (I was actually surprised it was written by a man.)  The ending is a pleasant surprise and cheer worthy.

At the start we are thankful (via a public service announcement) that Lunar Enterprises mines the moon for a valuable element called Helium 3, which is a clean source of energy on the Moon.  The Moon has been made a mining facility, basically strip-mining it (seeing the long stretches of gray on gray from space is eerie).<br /><br />Sam must not only deal with the loneliness of staying for three years alone to fulfill his contract, but must deal with strange dreams and visions as he seems to be slowly going nuts.  \\"Only two weeks left,\\" he exclaims to his robot pal, Gertie, voiced by Kevin Spacey in a strangely similar, sotto voce manner that HAL from 2001 imparted.<br /><br />There is no Frankenstein computer in this story.  It's a psychological thriller, very cerebral.  Action jockies can tune into Transformers, please.<br /><br />Without giving much away, the Company has found a way of replacing its work force efficiently and immorally.  Near the end of the film, Sam tells Gerdy \\"we are people, not programs.\\"<br /><br />If you're into a film that makes you think, figure out the clues and the actions of the cast, working out the puzzle and secrecy behind what's really going on, you'll enjoy this film.<br /><br />Haunting melody makes me want to get the sound track, too!<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />See also some Classic sci-fi to help you with this film as well:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000063UR1 Silent Running]]

B001EN71CW|4.0|The show is 5 stars all the way, but this is a review of the blu-ray product itself.  The picture is much improved from the DVD edition. The thing is the show was meant to look like it was old and shot hand held. In the Blu-ray you loose some of that feeling. The show is beautiful and a must own. If you already own the DVD the new special features are not worth the rebuy.     Final verdict is buy it only if you don't already own it on DVD.

The protagonist, one hesitates to call her a heroine, is unusual, super-intelligent and, when she's crossed, violently vengeful.  A great read!  And see the movie when it comes out!
0765356147|4.0|The Hero of Ages is the final book in the Mistborn Series. This book takes place after The Well of Ascension when they are tricked into releasing the evil spirit Ruin while attempting to close the Well of Ascension. The new emperor Elend Venture and his wife, the assassin Vin, are now hard-pressed to save the world from Ruin's deadly Inquisitors, and the lethal mists called the Deepness. All the while increasingly heavy falls of black ash that threaten to bury the land and starve the planet. As the two search for the Lord Rulers cache of atium, source of the strongest Mistborn power, they battle Ruin's forces as well as monsters and prophetic powers.<br /><br />The Hero of Ages is a must read if you enjoyed the other two books in the series. This book is a great end to the series. I'm a little disappointed that I the series is over, I really began to enjoy the plot and characters. I wouldn't mind if another book in this series came out.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Out standing DVD.  Great for our RV when we can't get the new digital channels (very often).
B001PPGAIK|1.0|i had hign hopes for this film, heard good things, but when i attempted to watch this movie I was greatly dissapointed, if i were to summarize things i found the movie to be a mess, a fantasy movie can be entertaining  and you are ok with the fact it is a fantasy, a dramatic film can draw you in with the realistic perfomances and themes, this movie tries to be both and fails at each, after watching this dog for 90 minutes, just gave up had no interest in what happens to these people. like 1 reviewer said \\" i hoped it would get better, but it never did\\" ditto for me
B00008L3NK|4.0|Frankly I do not understand the reviewer who was \\"down\\" on this DVD.  The concert was a pleasing as were the 10 others or so I have of the new year's concert series.  The orchestra and conducter worked well together.  They went a bit beyond Strauss and explored some of the other light repetore.  I am impressed, as usual, by Brian Large. I have found over the years that anything that involves Mr Large as the video director is first class -- this DVD is no exception.  This is not my first choice from the Vienna Philharmonic New Year's concert series (Willie Boskovosky and karjon would be my first choice) but it is credible and reasonably priced
B00127RAJY|5.0|The great thing about this video is it's short, so it's easier to find time to do it.. and yet it's effective.  You get as much out as you put in, I would recommend it for all fitness levels.
B000WC3AKI|3.0|This is a typical Hollywood summer blockbuster.  Lots of big effects, lots of action, and it's predictable.  Really though, it's a fun rollercoaster ride.  So long as you're not expecting anything else, then do yourself a favor and watch \\"Twister\\".  It won't disappoint.  Plus, it has a Star Wars reference in it, and any movie with a Star Wars reference ain't all bad.    On the other hand, my eyes about rolled out of my head when I heard the tornado give a menacing growl!  I thought, \\"yeah, typical Hollywood...\\"    But whatever.  This is a fun, exciting movie and everyone should enjoy it.  Plus, the soundtrack has two fantastic Van Halen songs, the last two of the Sammy Hagar era (which I was very sad to see end).  All things considered, I give it 3/5 stars.
B000W44IZW|5.0|all of you who know Luc Besson films this is not his or his star Jean Renos best but its light years in front of the mindless rubbish we are expected to pay and see,not for me i,d rather watch paint dry.Thankyou mr.DVD for your invention.
B001HN69AE|1.0|Thats pretty much what this garbadge is about: What if Goku was in High School and out of nowhere he just ohhh I don't know... wants to save the planet for no reason This movie should just be called Evolution because it has nothing to do with dragonball
0446613444|5.0|Read the description of the used condition of the book, ordered, shipped immediately, received immediately, exactly as described. Would not hesitate to use again.
B000BYCAJE|4.0|I have always been a CSN fan and bought this to replace an old album. It is still GREAT!
B000N6U0E2|3.0|Inspirational, rags-to-riches story starring Will Smith and son Jaden Smith (who plays Will's son in the film) makes for an agreeable evening's home entertainment, though if you've seen the film's trailer you've pretty much seen the film.  It was also a little strange to see brokerage employees as heartwarming guys who want to see Will's down-on-his-luck Chris Gardner character succeed.  But I guess the movie gets a few points for unpredictability on that score.  Generous extra features give us a look at the real-life Chris Gardner, the novelty of Will Smith working with his young son Jaden, and the amusing situations arising from the film's Italian director- Gabriele Mucchino- not being able to speak very good English.  I definitely enjoyed \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" (despite the title's annoying and intentional spelling error), but to part company with several of my fellow Amazon reviewers, I can't say it's one to write home about.  Crisp, sharp image and excellent sound on the DVD, though.
630521610X|5.0|Fan of Horror? How about slasher flicks like the ones from the 70's and 80's that are considered the classics?<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy the revival of the great American Slasher/Horror genre by the master of horror himself, Wes Craven. Kevin Williamson gets his launch pad crack at the boxoffice with his horror masterpiece Scream.<br /><br />Set in the everday small town of Woodsburrow, a town with a muder of Maureen Prescott fresh in their memories is about to be rocked by a serial killer claiming to be the original assailant. Now, one by one, Sydney Prescott's friends and family will be targeted by the serial killer bent on getting his hands, and knife on her. Wearing a bone shilling 'Ghost Face' mask, (on par with Jason/Micheal Myers masks), the killer toys and plays with his victims using a profound horror history knowledge to recreate and nodd toward some of the best (and scariest) horror moments is cinema history. Hold on to your seat or your mouth, and be prepared to Scream.<br /><br />\\"Whats your favorite Scary Movie?\\"  .... You may answer \\"This one\\".
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Gran Torino (2008) is a movie that is so brazenly anti-p.c. that I am surprised it was even made.  The movie shows the reality of gang warfare and the futility of trying to stand up to these thugs.  The epithet hurling Eastwood finds he has more in common with the hard-working and tradition-based Hmung than with the sniveling whiners who make up his own family.  Eastwood's character takes on the young boy \\"Toad\\" and teaches him important lessons.  The best scene in the movie occurs when Eastwood appears with a gun and tells the gang of street thugs to \\"Get off my lawn!\\".  It shows real attitude.  Anyone who has ever stepped out of the ivory tower long enough to witness the operations of these types of gangs can certainly appreciate this.  Ultimately the film features an epic showdown in which Eastood must take on the gang harassing Tao's family.  There is little left for him but to be put into an old-folk's home by his own superficial and parisitic family or to go out fighting.  As always, Eastwood chooses the tough guy's way.
B00005NRO3|5.0|The horrific events that swept Woodsburrow in Scream seem to be reviving as Hollywood has created a movie about the events called STAB, based off Gale Weathers exploitations in her book on the Woodsburrow Murders. And again, Sydney Prescott is the target.   Now in College, Sydney is trying to move foward in her life. School, boyfriend, and friends, but some of the scariest ghosts, come back to haunt a second time. Suddenly, the survivng Woodsburrow gang, and Sydney find themselves in the grasp of the ghost face killer, removing friends and family to single Sydney out. The rules of a scary movie sequel are tested and bent as the killer creates some of the scariest and most allaboriate scare scenes in the genres history. And that is just the begining. All screams come to a hault at the finale. You'll be holding your breath, and onto your chair.
B000UR9T7I|2.0|After the abysmal, overrated \\"Spider-man 2\\" ended, I hoped that, with the next film in the series, they would finally get past the emotional angst crap that I thought nearly ruined the movie, and finally deliver a film that once again returned the character back to his roots. But instead, the filmmakers decide to once again make Spidey an emotionally-complex character, and what only worked slightly for the previous entry pretty much wrecks \\"Spider-man 3,\\" probably the worst super-hero film I've seen. Ever.<br />Tobey Maguire proves that he's been seriously miscast as Spider-man/Peter Parker, and whatever talents he had in the role are wasted in lame attempts at making emo-Spidey look like a jerk-wad, but are the stupidest thing they could have done. The beautiful and talented Kirsten Dunst is given very little to work with, so her performance is only adequate at best. James Franco shows some chops, but not much. Topher Grace is pretty much wasted as Venom, and Bryce Dallas Howard, so easy on the eyes, is provided with little as well. The best performance of the film comes from Thomas Haden Church, who turns in a strong performance as Sandman, a conflicted character the audience can't help but sympathize with.<br />There's plenty of action, and the exciting climax makes up for a little, but the writer's packed way too much into a 139-minute movie, and the film drags because of it. What should have been a return to the elements of the comic book becomes a tedious, overly-long emo trip that fans are sure to find as horrid as I did.<br />The Blu-ray release is good, with great picture and sound, and some nice extras. But I just can't recommend it because of the movie itself. Take my advice: skip this film, and pray that they finally get it right in \\"Spider-man 4.\\" But with Sam Raimi and co. returning, I doubt they will. Grade: D+
6305903182|5.0|Scream 3 wraps up the trilogy of the best American Horror/Slasher revivial of the 90's and early 2000's. After narrowly surviving 2 psychotic events, Syndney Prescott is now in hiding, secluded from any human contact, and coping with the horrific events of her life, and her mother's death. And that is what the final chapter of a horror trilogy is all about... going back to the begining and discoving there are more skeletons in the closet then you or anyone knew.<br /><br />Scream 3 takes Kevin Williamson's amazing horror story, and concludes the 3rd chapter of Sydney Prescott and the Ghost faced killer that never stays dead. This time, the success of STAB and STAB 2, plus all the events at the Winsor College have launched a STAB 3 movie, which mirrors the haunting events of Sydney's life...and the terrifying eventst to come.<br /><br />Again, some of the best cinematic elements, scenes, and nods to the genre/its best, Scream 3 loops you all the way back to the begining of the story, and leaves you gasping for air. Turn down the lights, and grab a blanket, for the thrilling and terror filled conclustion to the Scream story....<br /><br />... or is it?<br /><br />\\"A horror story cannot have an ending... until the main character is killed\\"<br /><br />Scream 4 is coming soon...
6303122647|5.0|Tim Burton has a different way of presenting information.  It's unique, creative, original, and not exactly traditional 'warm and fuzzy.'  \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" has Jack wanting to change a tradition without really understanding everything that encompasses.  This story follows him through the process of wanting, trying to change, and the far-reaching results that follow.  And, of course, there's the love story that's interwoven.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|Cult classic film with controversial content throughout.     Referenced many times over, including in Wes Craven's SCREAM ( Tatum in the garage scene: \\"What movie is this from? 'I spit on your Garage'?)  and considered a horror classic and must have, I Spit On Your Grave is a movie to compare others in its genre to.     After a writer from the city rents a summer house on a lake, to get some quiet writing time, she is attacked by 4 locals and brutaly raped and beaten, many times over. But this is only the begining of the macobe and mayhem to occur that summer.     Unforgettable graphic scenes, especially one including a bath tub dismemberment, I Spit On Your Grave is sure to stick in your mind as one of the most memorable cult classic horror films to date.
0062511408|5.0|Me lo regalaron, despues de un corto viaje que tube hace un tiempo, en mi viaje entendi muchas cosas que estaban alrededor de mi vida pero no me habia dado cuenta, cuando comenze a leer este libro me ayuda a entender cual es mi proposito en este mundo. Buen libro lo recomiendo.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|For the longest time, I kept reading the description and thinking that I wouldn't like the book, but I finally bought it.  Then, when I started reading, I read the entire book in one sitting.  I highly recommend it!
B0010VHXOE|5.0|New CD, great price, LOVE David Gray and this album is fabulous.  Relaxing and mellow the whole way through.
B001Q1Y170|5.0|A few days ago I put this CD on, almost at random.  By the time it was half through, I had stopped what I was doing and just listened in awe.  Since then, I've probably played it a dozen times, some songs (Has He Got a Friend, End of the Rainbow, Great Valerio) many more times than that.  The debut album of Richard and Linda Thompson, in some ways, was never surpassed.  \\"Shoot Out the Lights\\" is also incredible, but I guess as I get older, the purity of the vision on the fundamental tragedy of life that is manifest in \\"I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight\\" becomes more compelling.  And Richard's guitar and Linda's voice are both so perfect.  I want a give a special pitch for The Great Valerio.  It's a perfect synthesis of poetry and music, profoundly thought provoking.  Listening to this album makes me feel less lonely, like there's someone who understands.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I'll start off by saying I'm over 40 and happened upon this series quite by accident.  After much consideration I decided to read the series to see if it measured up to all the fanfare.  Much to my surprise I fell in love with the characters and the storyline!  Breaking Dawn is beautiful and will leave you wanting more!
B000EWBNMS|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. If you like the supernatural along with mystery then this show is for you. I love the way all of the characters interact with each other.  The strong family ties.  The show keeps you guessing clear to the end.  I highly recommend this one!!
0307269981|3.0|Much as I loved Dragon, I didn't love Fire. I loved the first Larsson book so much I ordered the second from amazonUK since they've had it on sale since feb 2009. The middle 200 pages or so are boring, long-winded and uninteresting. The begining and the end are good but this book needed a ruthless editor. I am hoping that the third will be as good as the first, since I know I'll be reading that one as well.
B001JNNE64|1.0|If you liked the original, this \\"director's cut\\" should be avoided. For starters, why not include the original theatrical release on the Blu-ray??? Give me a break. At least I would have been able to salvage the disc. Seriously, it wasn't good enough to win the academy award; why re-edit it? None of the extra footage added anything to the movie on any level. It was just a wasted effort.....a total disappointment. Don't say I didn't warn you.
1572816295|5.0|The Paulina Tarot is a beautiful tarot deck---it has a dreamlike quality that really connects with your intuition and spirit.  I have had this  deck for about a month now, and it is truly one of my favorites in my  growing collection.  I have used it many times, and get very powerful and  accurate sessions.  This is one of those rare tarot decks which has not   only fabulous art, but also much symbolism and detail that really contribute to strong readings.    I love the Queen of Wands in this deck, especially!  What a fabulous  conception--the cat is huge and very mystical looking, next to the queen.  The two of pentacles reminds me of one of Chagall's circus riders.  The Star is especially lovely too.  I love this deck!
B000001Y79|5.0|In my opinion, this is their best album! I like every album they've ever made but simply this is their trademark...<br />When you are talking about No Doubt, you automatically think about \\"dont speak\\" \\"excuse me Mr.\\" & \\"the climb\\"... from the 1st time I heard the whole CD I knew all the songs (this is the 2nd time I buy it)<br />It's been more than 8yrs since I last heard it, yet I still knew all the lyrics... that's how much I love them...
B000059TEQ|5.0|This movie ranks as one of the ultimate \\"date movies\\" of all time.  Love Story, which stars Ryan O'Neil and Ali McGraw, has brought tears to the eyes of millions of movie lovers both young and old.  It is Romeo & Juliet of a different type; class (economic) differentiation and youthful rebellion against parental authority.  Beyond all of the angst of the story is the beautiful music of Frances Lai.  The acting of John Marley and Ray Milland in supporting roles is well done. The message of the movie is timeless and it is a very worthwhile view.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|after their smash hit 1st album Fallen... Evanescence returns with an even better, more fresh, yet familiar, sound/beat! The Open Door brings songs of hope, depair, regret, and love... I love this album!
0307276902|5.0|I had wanted to read this book since its big scandal and I am glad I finally did. I couldn't put it down. I'm not sure what is true and what isn't but to be honest, I didn't really care. I thought it was a fantastic book and have already passed it along to others to read.
1416550534|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The House at Riverton\\" and I'm completely sad that it's over. I was hooked from the very first page and just couldn't manage to put it down. This is not a book that I will soon forget. It feels like a classic, one that you pick up and read every year. I will definitely be reading this one over and over and over. I will be purchasing Morton's next book \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" because I think her writing is masterful and can't wait to see what enchanting story she has written this time.
B00243FQFA|4.0|I love SGA. The fifth season had some unfortunate departures from what I loved about the show, but it does contain two of my favorite episodes from the series, The Shrine and Vegas.  I always love the behind the scenes and extras, really liked that they finally had an interview with Joe Flanigan (Sheppard).  I wish there had been more actor commentaries (only one, from Jason Momoa on Broken Ties). The producers and writers seem to focus more on process and the mechanics of making the show, the actors seem to focus on the story and the characters, which is really why I want to hear the commentaries.  I truly did not appreciate the emphasis on the McKay and Keller romance this season, it disrupted the great team dynamics that were the heart of the series and lessened the importance of Sheppard, Teyla and Ronon.  I don't like hearing how the writers/producers think that this romance was cool, but, on the other hand, it is interesting to hear how much their perception of the show differs from what I and so many other fans saw as the good and the bad of SGA.  On the whole, I'd recommend this DVD set. Some great eps and some interesting extras.
1416550542|5.0|I just recently read Morton's first novel \\"The House at Riverton\\" and her storytelling captured me, so when I saw that she had a second novel out there was no question that I must read it. I just finished reading \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" and it was as good if not better than her first. I love the way that she takes us from one year to the next and back again weaving these extraordinary stories together with their mysterious twists an turns. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time wondering what was going to happen next, what secret was going to found. I have to say that this is not a book that I will soon forget and I'm quite sure it will have up lying awake at night remembering all the little details that led to the end of the story. I can't wait for the next novel out by this author because I have little doubt that it will be exceptional like her others.
1416562591|4.0|Poverty, inequity, labor exploitation, and corruption lie at the heart of Aravind Adiga's debut novel, The White Tiger. A man born and raised in central India -in what he calls \\"the darkness\\"- writes a letter to China's Premier in which he tells him the story of how he made it out of poverty through a combination of luck, ambiguous morals, and murder. It is an engaging story, full of hillarious remarks on social, political and economic issues of modern India. But above all, the novel is a cry of anger, an exposure of the contrasts of a nation that struggles to succeed in a world of markets and capitalism amidst growing poverty and inequality.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|This album is the definition of a great potential that needs some time. AP is transitioning his music by synthesizing different sub genres of electronic music into it.     Some songs are very exciting but some leave a mild disappointment - most of which are related to the content, or at some places even the existence, of the lyrics, and sometimes the bitter taste of a mixture done with not so right proportions.     Failures of the album, in my opinion, are; More Lost Without You and You Can Run (lyrics spoil them so much that they feel like recorded with only Billboards in mind); Mammogamm 04 (that distorted mumbling thingy with turntable shifts killed the whole song); Tijuanic (pace does not fit in).    Yes there are some bad apples but you should listen to this album! Because other than the failure songs, this album is full of pleasure and it will keep you waiting for more, dreaming about how AP will come up with something even better.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Wasn't sure what t expect, but once into this lunatic tale it was very funny. Some crackup scenes and lines, well acted and a fun trip.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I love this movie, its my second favorite in the series. the special features are great and its a great movie. the only back draw is that this is the only 2-disc special edition in the series so far that hasnt come with a slip cover or the cardboard sleeve. im a little ocd and a collector so it erks me that it doesnt go with the others, at least display wise. other than that, its great.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Well done Mr Eastwood sir, excellent movie all the way through.  Raw edgey and a great storyline.  More please.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Whats possibly the greatest movie soundtrack ever is a must have for any Twilight fan. Granted, CH's version of twilight was off, this soundtrack, however, is not. also it comes with 1 of 4 fold out posters at random.
B001NLL8LA|2.0|Although I like Child's way of writing...I felt that the story was basic and didn't go anywhere....it was a LOT of describing what streets in New York he was on...not very suspenseful....just okay, in my opinion....
B001PPLIEG|4.0|My DVD arrived in great shape!  I enjoyed the movie.  It's refreshing to see a slightly more \\"real\\" James Bond, not so much the cartoon character of the past.  However, I am a fan of all James Bond movies!!
B0000DG00B|5.0|Very impressed with the quality of this concert.  If you are a fan of the Allman Brothers Band - and want to listen to what all the hype was about, then any quality live recording of Duane, Dickie, Berry, Greg, Butch and Jaimoe has to be in your library. Of course, Fillmore East is easily the first one, and then the live recordings on Eat a Peach, but after that you are scrounging for quality original brothers music.    Well, look no more.  Johnny Winter does a great vocal on Hootchie Cootchie Man (no, it can not be Berry Oakley, it is definitely JW) and the live versions of the famous ABB songs are all played to great effect.    Duane and Dickie were definitely 'on' these nights (mornings).    BTW - I used the MP3 download facility and it worked flawless on my Mac.
B000NY12LO|1.0|This is the first Picoult novel I've read and it will be the last.  Her writing is pathetic - can't create an image without a cliched metaphor.  She got it completely wrong when trying to place her characters in popular culture - she writes about metal Superman lunch boxes and Wonder Woman underwear for children that would have been elementary school age in the mid-90's.  Just so inauthentic and trite.  Did this woman get super lucky with a first novel and now just churns them out by formula?  She tried to be topical with the school shooting storyline and brought nothing unique to the table.  Bottom line, she stinks, the book stinks.  BTW - I read this on a friend's recommendation and felt compelled to finish it ONLY for that reason.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Atlantis' final season is also its best.  The storylines for each episode are mature, as are the characters and their relationships, so that you'd have to wish that the series would continue for several more years.  Alas, the producers and SciFi channel thought they knew better and cancelled the show.  This kind of reminds me of the original Star Trek cancellation, or even New Coke -- as a big mistake.  The episodes in season 5 flow well together, and the disks are high quality, with a very clear and colorful picture and strong, clear sound.  Extended versions of Vegas and the final episode only add a scant one or two minutes, so this is a little disappointing, but on the whole the series ends on a good and hopeful note.  Of course, many of us are probably hoping that it won't end here and that the producers will reconsider, but time will tell if Atlantis' replacement -- a promo for it is on the first disk -- Stargate Universe will hold anyone's interest.
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|One of my favorite Michael Douglas movies.  It has a little of everything: action, suspense, and a great crime/detective story all the way around.
1572816112|5.0|Sorry for my poor English :(. When I saw this deck, I did't like it. But I recognised how wrong I was. This deck is amasing! It is not dark. It's surreal,fantastic! I love to work with this deck.
6305428298|4.0|Fabulous sleeper of a movie. Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine were terrific and Jane Horrocks' singing a revelation. Ewan McGregor was a nice surprise as Little Voice's beau.

1401923119|4.0|In about 175 easy-to-read pages, Lipton covers everything from cell mem\\"brains\\" to Mandelbrots, from the point of view that environments influence everything about us and our world and we can change ourselves by changing these environments, both internally and externally.<br />The challenge is this: He tells us that we need to make CONSCIOUS changes, then he says that it is practically impossible for the conscious mind to overcome the SUBCONSCIOUS, where all of our false beliefs live.<br />If you enjoy THINKING, you'll probably like this book. If you're looking for an easy answer, you probably won't like it.<br />While I don't agree with everything in this book, it is very interesting and I recommend it.<br /><br />I consider 3 stars to be a 'good' rating; and 4 stars to be a 'very good' rating.<br />A book would have to be 'exceptional' to get 5 stars from me.

0385340575|5.0|A year ago, I read Lee Child's last Reacher thriller, the politicized [[ASIN:044024367X Nothing to Lose (Jack Reacher, No. 12)]], a disaster in public relations vis-&agrave;-vis his fan base that left more than just a few customer reviewers, including myself, shaking their heads and wondering what the author, his editor, and his publisher could possibly have been thinking. Could Lee subsequently redeem himself? Happily, with GONE TOMORROW, the author has done so brilliantly and in a manner reminiscent of the original form which made ex-military MP Jack Reacher so compelling in the first place.<br /><br />When this book opens during the wee-hours on a New York subway train, Reacher approaches a young woman (\\"I can help you\\") that he judges to be a suicide bomber. Without much further ado, she blows off her own head with a .357 Magnum revolver. With that, Jack becomes embroiled with an emerging U.S. presidential candidate hiding a past, the FBI, the Department of Defense, and most certainly the nastiest villains Reacher has yet encountered in a dozen previous adventures.<br /><br />As I progressed through the pages, I was struck for the first time - perhaps I hadn't been sufficiently attentive before - how the author ends each chapter with a line that compels the reader - at least this reader - to press on no matter the lateness of the hour. And on a school night, too. That signifies to me a master of the craft. One warning, however, if you've a vivid imagination. There's one chapter not for the faint of heart about three-quarters of the way in that may keep you from getting to sleep because of the horrific images it will call up. If the book is ever translated to the Big Screen, this scene will prompt my visit to the concession stand.<br /><br />The conclusion to GONE TOMORROW has perhaps the most nail-biting and deadliest personal combat sequence of Reacher's literary life. Of course, we all know he'll win any face-off, but that doesn't mean he won't find it dodgy.<br /><br />No doubt about it, Jack and his creator are back in their top forms.

B001GCUNWG|3.0|Why are there dinosaurs when they all died off in the first movie?  According to this film, the dinos are living underground beneath a crust of ice.  Other than that, the film was cute Y-7 (7 year old and up) type cartoon fare.      The story is that the gang's going to be breaking up now that Manny and Ellie (v. by Ray Romano and Queen Latifah), the woolly mammoths, are going to be having their baby. Diego (v. by Denis Leary) is ready to leave, but Sid the Sloth (v. by John Leguizamo) can't figure out why they don't all stay a herd.      When Sid adopts three dino babies of his own, not knowing what they are, of course) the whole crew goes underground and into the land of the dino to rescue him.  We get a new character, Buck the Weasel (v. by Simon Pegg) who stole the show with Scrat the Squirrel.  The story's predictable with a lot of warm-hearted fun despite the cold place they are all living in.      All in all, the film was cute.  There is enough laughs to carry it through and I definitely see a whole herd of toys and games emerging from this, which is probably why the movie industry is making kid films now anyway.  Worth a slow afternoon at matinee prices.     Rebecca Kyle, July 2009
067960085X|4.0|For such a short book (and maybe because it's so short, and I tend to read several at one time), it took me a while to get through this one. But once I got on a roll, I'm glad I read Breakfast at Tiffany's. I've never seen the movie, but I expected the story to be much lighter than it was. Still, an interesting story.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the short stories also included in this book, and was especially intrigued and moved by \\"A Christmas Memory.\\" I loved the writing in this one. For instance, the way Capote described the look and smell of the coins was amazing, I thought. The relationship between the two main characters was poignant.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I am not review fanatic or some person that thinks my opinion is the only one that counts. Simply put this is an excellent film that my wife and I saw twice and she was not a Star Trek fan at all. She was the one crying in the first 10 minutes of the film and I was completely engrossed throughout the entire film. It was my wife that suggested we see it again. I believe the Next Generation definitely has something to look forward to! Enjoy!
B001KVZ6ES|4.0|I gave this moving a 4 because at least the first half of the movie is slow but when it gets going it is a very good movie.  I do not think this is one of our favorite movies but it is a good movie.
B0020MKTOS|4.0|i really enjoyed this movie and thought it was fantastic, the acting as well as the presentation. for a change it lived up to my expectations. thanks.
B00186K7EE|1.0|This seller is inhuman cashing in on something like this, plus this isn't an official US release and will likely not work on your player anyway.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|I'm a \\"Porcupine Tree\\" fan, so I knew I'd probably enjoy Steven Wilson's solo album \\"Insurgentes\\", and I was not at all disappointed.  It is truly excellent.  Very atmospheric and moody, Wilson takes the best of PT and goes off in his own direction with it all.  I've been spinning this album since I got in to work this morning and I'm really digging it.  Not a bad track on the entire album.  I've yet to hear the surround sound on the DVD, but from what I've seen on reviews here, I've got something to look forward to. Worthwhile purchase.
0062502182|1.0|I purchased this book based on the rabid following of the author and the positive reviews I'd heard. I could not have been more disappointed. The further I am removed from reading it, the more disturbed I become. As other reviewers have noted, the story is insanely shallow, trite and sexist. The narrative is some of the most redundant I've ever read (especially in a book that clocks in at under 200 pages).    But these issues pale in comparison to the problem with the main message of the book. The much-touted moral lessons about following your dreams are possibly the worst bits of self-help in existence. The message is to find a ridiculous obsession (because that's really a better word than dream...dreams are ambitions. Treasure hunts are just obsessions) and follow it through to its conclusion, no matter the cost. Somehow this narcissistic act of selfishness is going to get the universe to do you a lot of favors. It even gets it's own mysterious and philosophical title...Beginner's Luck! Wow.    Coelho may think that the greatest lie ever told is that we are victims of fate. I say people need to get better at recognizing the beauty of the things they have, and the mystery inherent in simple everyday pleasures. Looking for omens that tell you how to fulfill some childhood fantasy is a fool's errand. Do the things that make you happy, you know what they are. It's not hard, and you don't need the spirit of the wind in order to recognize them.
B000092PT7|5.0|I love Jack Johnson. His music is nice to listen too.
159562015X|4.0|If you are looking to find where you will be most successful, this is the book to get. The online test only takes 30 minutes to complete, and the resources offered to you are great. If you get a chance buy the first edition too because it explains alot about how humans develop their personality and personal tendencies.     Great tool for managing yourself and others.

B0014KA1UE|5.0|With his recent passing, I took the time to listen to some Michael Jackson's later work and was surprised to find the second disc of this package ranks with some his greatest work. Better than Bad, Invincible and possibly Dangerous, any true Michael Jackson fan will be very pleased with the new songs on this CD. Naturally the first disc cannot fail to make anyone happy. Let us take a moment to thank heaven for the first and greatest \\"crossover\\" artist now that he has made his final crossover.
B0000029LG|5.0|I bought History in 1995, and I still love it.  Disc one contains classic cuts from Michael's three most successful solo albums.  My favorite cuts are \\"Rock With You\\", \\"Thirller\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Remember the Time\\" and \\"Beat It\\".  Disc two contains more personal songs.  I love his duet \\"Scream\\" with his sister Janet.  \\"Childhood\\" is a deeply personal song about Michael's lost childhood.  This song is beautiful.  \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\" has such a great beat.  I love the electric guitar playing on this track.  \\"Smile\\" and \\"You Are Not Alone\\" are such peaceful songs.  They really relaxe me. Mike sounds great covering the Beatles classic \\"Come Together\\".  I love the music contained on these two discs very much.
B001UXJQHE|5.0|\\"Live in Australia\\" is a feast for the eyes and ears as Andre Rieu's first DVD featuring the stunning Schonbrunn Castle set. There are new Australian numbers on this DVD, as well as less-played songs from recent shows and new arrangements of songs like \\"Bolero.\\" Andre fearlessly includes the realities of live performance, not editing out a microphone failure on \\"You Belong to Me\\". Thousands of Australians filled the Telstradome for this concert, and you can see Andre's emotion as he plays \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" at the end of the encores.
B00288KNLS|4.0|Coraline is a visually stunning claymation type of film that is very reminicent of Tim Burton.  It revolves around a mom and dad and their daughter Coraline moving into a huge and sorta creepy looking victorian manor which is also occupied by other weird tenants. It is based on a children's book, but the look and feel of the film is certainly on the creepy side. Personally, I think younger kids would get frightenend after watching certain parts and there is this high wire act by these 2 old lady tenants that creeped ME out.     The plot is actually a tad on the confusing side, especially towards the end, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The fantastical elements were wonderfully executed and the grim, washed-out feel to the film really created the mood. There are a few great but weird characters and it seems like everyone has some mystery to hide.     It's a shame it didn't really get much recognition when it came out into theaters, but I predict it will do nicely on DVD.
B0011FTQ4O|5.0|Quite honestly, I'm shocked that this has not come out on Blu-ray for the US; Almost Famous garnered serious critical acclaim when it came out and for good reason.  When I learned several years ago that there was an extended version of the film, I could never afford it because it was in some crazy collector's edition.  Now, with this version, I have the extra footage, which fits into and accents the movie better than I could have hoped, and it's in pristine 1080P resolution...  At times it's like being at a concert!  I'm not sure what players this was meant for, but I have a US player and it is perfect!  If you have read this far, stop screwing around and pull the trigger on this one, you'll be glad you did!
B001U0HBPG|3.0|A little tedious and long. It covered the  relationship issue well, but I believe that there are many more questions and issues that could have been raised with more detail - body image, aging, feelings and thought going on in his mind, and more that I can't think of right now. In some ways it was too predictable, when I left the room and returned I could easily guess what had happened. I didn't even bother to push pause. Acting was acceptable, but not great. Generally, the kind of movie during which you can make a sandwich.
0521008433|5.0|It's a very detailed book for those who would like to have a general idea about some of the most traditional  approaches and methodologies in Language teaching. I like it very much.
B002436WJE|5.0|This movie entertained us for over 90 minutes and then some with the extras they included.  I haven't downloaded the digital copy yet; however, I will later.  It is worth watching again over a phone while waiting in line etc.  The movie itself is headed by what I would describe as a real actor.  Some may disagree but Liam is super in this role.  His character almost appears real.  Almost because he is such a wimp when it comes to his ex and his daughter.  You'd never know he is a waling death trap ready to jamb 10 inch nails in your thigh so they will hold the electric connector.  One bad boy.  Even though you know many scenes are fake you cannot help but feel a part of the action.  Poor Peter.  He felt a part of the action as well.<br /><br />Make sure you surround system is working because otherwise you will miss the well executed sounds.  They did such a fine job with the sound that you can hear a car entering from the right to the center and ending on the left front speakers and hear the attendant background noises.  You hear a bullet leave the gun and end up on the other side of the room.  Loud?  Oh, yes.  I had to turn the sound down on some of the scenes or blow the woofer and knock pictures off the walls.  The dogs turned on me as well.  How dare you to play that thing so loud.<br /><br />The overall quality of the DVD lacked brightness throughout.  I did not readjust my brightness controls in order to fix it.  That condition of darkness may be my TV or the Disk.  I do not know.  The TV shows properly on HD and SD.  No big thing, however.  The movie itself is just downright moving and entertaining.  Instead of leaving the room while the movie is playing, we paused it so we would not miss anything.  It is that good.
B0024F08RO|5.0|If you are a fan of Prison Break--they saved the best for last.  Excellent.
B001NLKSI4|3.0|It is hard to review this book because we get so upset about the main character that our feelings spread to the book itself. The book is fun and interesting, not because it is well written (it is not) but because the situation itself is original and adventurous. Therefore, the only merit Belfort has as an author is that \\"he has been there\\".    In this book, Belfort tells us about the events after getting caught by the FBI, how he ratted his friends, and his relationship with women. He sounds like he was very sorry about being caught, but not at all about the people he screwed. In fact, the first thing he does after his money runs dry is to start selling mortgage based loans to poor people (knowing well that they will lose their houses).     Belfort suffers from a pathological inability to put himself in other people's shoes, he is unable to relate to feelings and to have anything more than a childish relationship with anyone. This goes for his victims and his women. My bet is that he is a psychopath in some degree. He refers to his second wife as a Duchess, and basically has a marriage based on sex. Everybody tells him she is a gold-digging whore, but he is the only one who can't see it (she is). Then he goes on to live with a dysfunctional super-model who can't even have a conversation with him. Women are trophies for his vanity.     The only truth we read in the whole book is when the judge says that he is not super-talented as he thinks, that many people as talented as him didn't get as much money just because they refrained from crossing the criminal line. That's the bottom line: Belfort is not super smart, he is a super liar, one who lies even to himself.
B00080ZG1A|3.0|Several things disturb me about this film. I shall start with this chap DiCaprio. DiCaprio simply looks nothing like Howard. His eyes are quite blue and all the women who fell in love with Howard (which was all of the ones he pursued with the exceptions of Jean Simmons, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Crawford and Ingrid Bergman) commented on his seductive \\"liquid\\" deep, sad brown eyes. The director should at least have had the actor wear brown contact lenses. I think this point is important because his Adonis-like appearance wielded considerable influence over both men and women (Both genders fell for him in equal measure). In fact, the director William Desmond Taylor desperately wanted to put Howard in pictures as a leading man, but Howard's interests lay behind the camera instead.   DiCaprio is too young for the gravitas and profundity that was Howard Hughes. Additionally, DiCaprio's portrayal of Howard presents him as brash, gauche and impolite, spouting profanity - the ugly American stereotype, if you will. Howard's mother was an Aristocratic highly refined Victorian lady. Indeed, a true blue blood - one of her relatives was a general in the Civil War, I believe, and she had geneological connections to George Washington etc... She had a prodigious and comprehensive influence on Howard's tastes, values and behaviour. As a result, Howard grew up with the reserve and refinement  possessed by men of his class. He was always at pains to be polite and was quiescent and INORDINATELY SHY besides. This is one of the first things about him mentioned by those who knew him. The scene in the picture in the Cocoanut Grove where DiCaprio brazenly invites a cigarette girl up to his hotel room is something Howard would never have done. He would have found it vulgar. Howard was in awe of beautiful women and would always seek out a proper introduction from a third party before approaching a lady he coveted. Even with Faith Domergue: He first met her incidentally when she was accompanyinga friend whom Howard was then seeing. He was mesmerized by her and took her for a sailing trip during which he sat on the boat simply staring at her (not speaking) for hours.    Several scenes in the picture show DiCaprio wearing tennis shoes. Now, if the producers had simply bothered to listen to the last interview Howard gave from the Bahamas in 1971, they would have known better: As the well-bred man he was, Howard wore tennis shoes only on the tennis court. During the war, when leather was rationed, shoes were made from non-strategic material which was a sort of canvas. Howard had a pair of these which he liked and wore, but which some newsman termed \\"tennis shoes,\\" hence this idea that he wore tennis shoes in public was born. He never did. Another inaccuracy: The filmakers show DiCaprio requesting milk as his beverage of choice. While Howard eschewed alcohol, his preferred beverage was usually water or vegetable juice.  Yet another  inaccuracy in the picture : Howard attended the opening of \\"Hell's Angels\\" not with Jean Harlow as depicted in the picture, but with Billie Dove, arguably the greatest love of his life. There were several instances in the picture where others around him appeared to direct or guide him, in other words they had the upper hand. I feel this doesn't ring true. Howard was nothing if not always in control. This was one of his problems. He simply HAD to have control over people and situations. Because of this and also because of his greater wisdom, discernment, savoir faire and high IQ, everyone looked to him for leadership and guidance, not the other way around.    I felt the extent of DiCaprio's attempts to embody Howard were limited to the constant scowl or frown he maintained resutling in the ubiquitous and deep ridge between his eyebrows. I just felt the actor was attempting a role that proved too much for him. This becomes more obvious when he is in scenes with Alan Alda or Cate Blanchett, much better actors. I felt his job was amaturish and I wish the producers had acquired a more seasoned actor to portray this remarkable man.   However, I will allow that if DiCaprio shines anywhere in this film it is during his portrayal of Howard during the Senate hearings. The moustache helps. The actor obviously assiduously studied the videotapes of the hearings. I also applaud him for simply trying to imitate a man who was inimitable.    And why did the filmakers not portray Howard's trip around the world more fully? This was remarkable and did a tremendous lot to advance the idea that commercial aviation was a plausible idea. He was very proud of this accomplishment.    I was also displeased by the portrayal of Howard's alleged OCD. While it is important to educate people about this condition and  find ways to help sufferers, Howard was an extremely private man and would absolutely abhor anyone knowing about his personal problems. We all have problems - but this man was exceptional: exceptionally intelligent, exceptionally kind and generous (despite publicity to the contrary), exceptionally handsome, exceptionally capable, exceptionally strong and brave,  exceptionally savvy and discerning, exceptionally obstinate and sedulous, exceptionally wealthy. I feel it is more important and moreover it is what we owe him as custodians of his legacy to publicize his genius and  unique gifts which advanced civilization with regards to aeronautics, commercial aviation, filmaking, technology and research. I fear the scenes of his aberrant behavior only served to make him look  silly and ridiculous. For years he has been called a \\"madman\\" and I am sick of this. HE WAS NEVER \\"MAD\\" as we normally use the term. Recall how after a \\"spell\\" of aberration, he was able to take on the malfeasance of Senator Brewster and Brewster's attempts to ruin him and in turn ruin Brewster instead! Could a madman have accomplished this??? Indeed, after Howard had vindicated himself in Washington, Brewster was unable to get even a job as a legal clerk!! While I am glad the picture does indeed show Howard's heroic vindication, I am afraid that, because of the sensationalistic nature of the medium and most people's desire to voyeristically observe others they consider \\"freaks\\", I fear the \\"madman\\" tag will continue to overshadow the absolute and unique brilliance of this man.  If you see this picture, please realize that this is Hollywood sensationalism, whatever else it may be. Howard was at once gentle and kind, sensitive and generous - obstinate, determined, wily, rapacious and could be Machiavellian in his attempts to get what he wanted. He had his personal problems, but this is not what is notable about him. Please remember him as he would have wished: As a pioneering aviator, an engineer, inventor,wise, courageous brilliant man who cared about contributing his unique gifts in ways which would advance civilization, which is what he did.
B001NESPHC|5.0|A friend & I saw the one song she did on David Letterman, went to amazon.com and ordered this one and loved it.  She has a smokey, silk, and seductive voice, enjoyed all the songs.  would highly recomend.
B00164KYV4|5.0|I'm not sentimental, I don't particularly like romantic comedies or comedies for that matter. Chick flicks will occasionally get a chuckle or good feeling from me, but they're just generally so...you know what I'm going to say.     This movie shares some attributes with one movie I do like, \\"When Harry Met Sally\\", the interviews in between segments, but done slightly differently.     OK. I loved this movie.    I almost cheered when Ginnifer Goodwin (Gigi) and Justin Long (Alex) got together. It was sooo cute.     Scarlett Johansson, who I always thought was pretty is positively thick for this movie. Really smokin' hot. She's a great actress, too. I've always liked Ben Affleck and Jennifer Anniston and they didn't disappoint. I didn't care for Jennifer Connelly's character and felt like stomping on her foot by the end of the movie, but they can't all be winners, can they? I like Drew Barrymore too and her character was cute in a Drew Barrymore way, but she was swallowed up by the other sizable actors around her in her seemingly small role. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where Drew Barrymore was dwarfed before. Even in \\"Donnie Darko\\", her supporting role spotlighted her between the Gyllenhals. Kris Kristofferson as Jennifer Aniston's dad and Luis Guzman as a typecast Mexican worker role: two great actors which were sadly almost were non-existent in this movie...disappointing. I was just waiting to see what happened with Long and Goodwin! Really.     Goodwin, Long and Johansson stole this movie, they emitted vibrant waves dragging me into the story. I was helpless. I better save this review before I delete it out of embarrassment.    This movie is warm, smart and heartfelt. Don't miss it. See you at the next chick-flick.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Same review for this one as for My One and Only Thrill. Saw her on David Letterman, and had to hear more.  Would recomend this one as well
B001CZVVWI|3.0|Others have covered the musical aspects well so I will stick to the production.  I think it was influenced by the Dario Fo staging [[ASIN:B00001O2G9 Rossini - Il barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville) / Dario Fo, Zedda, Larmore, Croft, Netherlands Opera]].  I wish the latter was available in blu-ray/wide screen because the commedia dell'arte was so much better done.  In the Madrid production, I was also bothered by:    1. The silliness of the multi-period costumes and props (flashlights and wigs).      2. The mostly black and white visual experience until it bursts into color in the last scene.  What was the point?    3. The superficial documentary.  They had Flórez sitting at a piano.  Can he really play?  Why didn't he demonstrate how he chooses the ornaments he adds so as to conform to the harmony?    This was only the second opera blu-ray I've seen but I'll make a preliminary judgment.  The visual advantage is most apparent in full stage scenes.  In ordinary DVDs, individuals tend to get blurry when not viewed close up.  The lossless sound, DTS-MA in this case, was slightly clearer than what you hear on recent ordinary DTS tracks.

0307341569|4.0|After reading Sharp Objects, I was pleased to see another book by this author. I won't recap the book (as it's been done already), but I will say it was a fast enjoyable read. There were parts that were pretty gritty & heart wrenching, and it's actually hard to really like the main character (Libby Day). But you spend a lot of time from the perspective of many characters, and eventually see how their stories create the solution to a terrible crime.<br /><br />The story was well written, and well researched. The author did a nice job of keeping multiple characters & stories from becoming too confusing. I was equally attached to all characters - as they were all well developed. I would recommend this to anyone that likes Patterson or Connolly, and I will look forward to her next book.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This edition of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children fills in the blanks of the original DVD release. Plus, violence is not removed in this version. Blood takes its place in this film, and the final Sephiroth battle is downright brutal, yet awesome. I recommend this movie instead of the first release. Plus, the Blu-Ray transfer is awesome to say the least.
0307408833|4.0|I'm based in London, and I am finding it hard to source the ingredients.  Need to find the ingredients before I commence cooking.  The book is gorgeous to look at and has some great pictures, but I think the reason it is not available here is the lack of ingredients in the UK.
0312383320|3.0|I usually like the between the numbers books for some fun, light reading. I especially enjoyed [[ASIN:B001IV5W6M Plum Lucky (A Between-the-Numbers Novel)]] and had hoped that \\"Plum Spooky\\" would be just as entertaining. The book is longer than previous between the numbers books and that looked promising. However, there was less substance to the story than any of the previous stories. Lula was as fun as always, but there wasn't enough Ranger or Grandma in this one and many of the jokes were just silly. There were still some laugh-out-loud lines, but not near enough.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I was mesmerized from the start by this incredibly creative movie that really fleshed out the Dr. Seuss story.  I like the message that even though we can't see something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  It's clean and uplifting, although I felt the climax dragged on a little too long.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I read all of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series and was eager for more! [[ASIN:0441017770 Sookie Stackhouse, Books 1-7]]  Since I don't get HBO I ordered the True Blood Series DVD's that are based on the books. [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]]  I was not dissappointed!  The DVD's are enough like the books that I could still relate to the characters, but there were new characters and new situations making the DVD's fresh. I wanted to watch one DVD immediately after the other! The DVD's are more shocking than the books though, so if it's the romance you like, these may too much for a weak stomach or sensitive ears.
B000BH4YJ0|3.0|This was my very first contact with Luis Miguel and bought the audio cd. Fantastic voice, wonderfull selection of boleros and if it was not for the omnipresence of the strings I would give it a 5 star. After listening to the very same musics recorded many years ago, even with strings, I keep my 3 stars.
0307269752|4.0|I love a good mystery as much as anyone, but my problem with mysteries is that they mostly involve grisly crimes, and thus, give me all kinds of nightmares.  While I loved the writing, the characters, and the storytelling of this book, the nightmares I've had the past three nights really weren't worth it.  I guess if you're a seasoned mystery reader, it might not be as shocking, but please be forewarned that there is some really disconcerting stuff in here.<br /><br />That being said, the plot intricacies really kept me interested.  For the first 100 pages or so, I wasn't sure how it was all going to come together, but then, once it started to, it was magical.<br /><br />I really want to read the sequels because the writing is so excellent, but think I might wait until I'm on vacation, and can easily put up with some sleepless nights.
0930073193|5.0|My educated (self read) friends and I highly recommend this book. The liberal theologians, most highly educated people - not all, and the elitists (those that think the rest of us are dumb) will hate this book.  But don't let that stop you from reading it let it encourage you to do so. The book has been in print for more than 50 years.  It tells the truth of how a healthy free market economic system works so that even a 12 year old could understand it. Perhaps that's why the \\"educated\\" among us dislike it so. Einstein once said \\"...if you couldn't explain the mechanics how something worked to a 12 year old so that he understood it, you yourself didn't understand it.  I believe he was right.  So if your are interested in how a healthy free market economic system, read this book.  If you are interested in how growing government and debt to its present levels and beyond (it's in the Obama plan) will end our economy and way of life as Americans in one generation, read this book.  A most excellent read!

B000003TA4|5.0|Realeased nearly twenty years ago Nevermind is still as great as it was the day it came out and now is considered a classic and one of the greatest albums of all time by many, and that's not too hard to argue with if you've ever heard the album. Everything about this album was reveloutionary the cover, the name, and most importantly the music it includes. Twelve songs in total it was the album that introduced grunge to the world and created a tottally unique and new BIG sound in rock music that hasn't been duplicated since or yet.<br /><br />  Nevermind like all great rock albums has a sound to it that is unique and sounds unlike anything else before or since, as on albums such as, Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, Dark Side Of The Moon, Highway 61 Revisited, Are You Experienced?, Tommy, or even OK Computer for that matter, anyways back to the point. You can guarantee that with every song there will be a pounding beat and heavy shredding guitars and grainy, rasped, and angry vocals. Songs like, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", etc, are some of the greatest songs to come out of the 90s and Nevermind is purley one of the greatest and most influential albums of the 90s and is now considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time. Trust me once you listen to it once you'll be hooked on listening to it constantly, enjoy.

0307341550|5.0|Gillian Flynn is a tremendous writer. Her writing is interesting, clean, and captures the audience well with such articulated imagery.  She has a style that is dark, comic, and suspenseful.  Her character development is true--you feel like you know them.<br /><br />In Sharp Objects, the reader is introduced to Camille Preaker, a thirty something journalist from a second rate Chicago newspaper.  Plucked from the drudgery of her day to day existence, her editor tells her to go home and investigate the murder and disappearance of two girls.  Not such an easy task, as Flynn develops two simultaneous stories: a family life that looks perfect, but is anything but: Camille is a cutter (but not an ordinary cutter), her sister Marion died young and this is something no one in the family has dealt with properly, and her mother is the perfection in public, but in private you can sense her hatred.  This family drama slowly creeps into the story as Camille does return to small town Missouri.  Ingratiating herself back as a townie to gain confidence and access to the confused/devastated small town, Camille experiences more than her family and job demands: she develops a crush on a detective.  All this as we follow Camille get deeper into the case, and in to her mother's home: it is a suspenseful novel that will keep you guessing.<br /><br />I personally found the intersecting stories developed the narrative.  I also found her discussion of mother-daughter relationships to be stark and developed.  She goes into familiar territory, but describes it like nothing I have read before.  There was an immense possibility for this novel to be a string of clich&eacute;s, but Flynn is so fresh and dynamic.  She allows you to see a killer in everyone, and then wallop you with more shocking revelations.  This book will deliver!  Highly recommended.  Also check out her sophomore triumph: [[ASIN:0307341569 Dark Places: A Novel]], a different story, but with all the suspense and twists of Sharp Objects.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|This HBO Miniseries is based on the biography, \\"John Adams\\" by David McCullough, which was awarded the 2002 Pulitzer Prize.     The series is exceptionally well produced, with great attention to historical detail (period costume, etc.) and superb acting in the historical roles of Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and other key founding fathers.    The story and the storytelling are so compelling that it may be quite some time before you realize that you are witnessing the early history of the United States unfolding in live action around you! One example of this is found in the first minutes of the entire series. History books paint in very broad strokes the significance of the Boston Massacre in 1770, but few people (including myself, prior to watching this series) are aware that John Adams successfully defended the British soldiers in the trial that followed!      This product is not meant for the dusty shelves of self-professed history buffs! The entertainment value of this Miniseries alone should make it a worthwhile purchase for anyone who might enjoy the feel of being a fly on the wall in the world of our founding fathers, who endured great hardship in the struggle for Independence.     As an added value, I believe that watching just the first two episodes is as effective an education in early American History as an entire semester in History class! (I say this as a history teacher who enjoyed this series first for its entertainment value, and now realizes how useful it may be in the classroom)    I bought this product when it sold for about $26.99, so it may be worthwhile to wait for a comparable price, as this is a significant savings (55%) off the suggested retail price.
B00042YL4A|5.0|The New Romantic movement gave us many memorable artists, but perhaps none left as stylish and indelible a mark as Sheffield's ABC. The band first hit the U.K. charts with \\"Tears Are Not Enough\\" on their own Neutron label. Interest in the single lands them a deal with a major label and Trevor Horn (Yes, Art of Noise) agrees to produce their first full length recording. The end result \\"Lexicon of Love\\" is one of the quintessential New Romantic recordings. A lush paean to love it summons echoes of Roxy Music, but at the same was very original and unique. Fronted by vocalist extraordinaire Martin Fry the crack four man group was ably augmented by Horn's studio wizardry. Equal parts intelligence, flamboyance and swagger Fry commands the show and his lyrics reflect a mixture of ecstasy and agony, treachery and regret, irony and sorrow. Hearing the original demo of \\"Tears...\\" you can hear the genesis of what would evolve under the benevolent tutelage of Trevor Horn. Who made who is obvious.<br /><br />The curtain lifts on with the dramatic opener \\"Show Me\\" with Fry soaring to a wonderful falsetto at points amid a lush orchestrated backdrop, the perfect set up for \\"Poison Arrow,\\" perhaps one of their best tracks. The video of \\"Poison Arrow\\" is perhaps most indelibly etched in people's memories for the band in white ties and Martin cavorting in the infamous gold lam&eacute; suit with an 80s beauty. On the pulsating track the wonderful Tessa Niles plays vocal foil to Martin who posits \\"I thought you loved me, but it seems you don't care\\" to which Tessa counters \\"I care enough to know I can never love you\\" to a crescendo of drums. The song is absolute ecstasy and my all-time favorite. \\"Many Happy Returns\\" starts off with a spoken into and then rapidly picks up tempo and actually points the direction ABC would go with the following release \\"Beauty Stab.\\" Fry's lyrics and the raw emotionalism of the song is quite striking and it gives yet another chance to show off his astonishing falsetto. \\"Many Happy Returns\\" glides into the rambunctious \\"Tears Are Not Enough\\" which kicks off with Martin's highest falsetto. The track crackles with life recalling Haircut 100 (a contemporary New Romantic band) with its lively horns and prominent bass line. While it bears a passing resemblance to the demo version it's clear that Trevor Horn is the mastermind pumping life and energy into the recording. Heavy strings and glockenspiel (or is it fairlight?) open \\"Valentines Day\\" with Martin pushing his vocals to their very limits building to a crescendo where Martin implies \\"I'd be a Millionaire; I'd be a Fred Astaire.\\" There's nowhere to go but the first single that broke ABC in the USA, \\"Look of Love (Part One)\\" which summons up images of the dapper band from their music video. Vocally this is a showcase for Martin's full range, from low spoken asides and growls up to his falsetto. Musically its ABCs absolute zenith with full orchestration and once its over its hard to imagine where you could go from such ecstasy, but there's more cards up Martin's sleeve. \\"Date Stamp\\" is pure Trevor at the intro pointing at things to come for Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Propaganda, and others. Martin and Tessa heat things up in what is practically a duet against a thumping bass line. What follows is perhaps one of my favorite track \\"All of My Heart\\" a profoundly felt song on love, loss, and regret reflected in Martin's vulnerable and heartfelt vocals. For me the recording could and should have ended here as there's no way you could top the sentiments and raw emotionality in \\"All of My Heart.\\" Recalling not so much \\"Manifesto\\" or \\"Flesh and Blood\\" era Roxy Music as it does \\"Avalon\\" it would be the obvious direction for ABC to continue. Instead things resume with \\"4 Ever 2 Gether\\" a slight tune with a rather creepy intro and eerie backing track that hints somewhat at where they would go with \\"Beauty Stab.\\" The rather fitting coda to it all is the closing blast of \\"Look of Love(Part Two).\\"<br /><br />This particular collection adds a number of live tracks recorded around the same era this was initially released that give you a sense of how good a live band ABC was at the time.  ABC epitomized everything great about the New Romantics and this recording perfectly encapsulates 1982 and that era. ABC were on the cutting edge with sumptuous videos and sterling production. From \\"Lexicon...\\" they moved to the perceived misstep of \\"Beauty Stab\\" from which they would recover. \\"Lexicon...\\" has nary a dull track and will have you enthralled from start to finish. A must for any fan of 80s or New Romantic music!This particular collection adds a number of live tracks recorded around the same era this was initially released that give you a sense of how good a live band ABC was at the time.

B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is, in my opinion, the best Civil War movie ever made, if not the best war movie ever made. It tells the story of the three-day long battle at Gettysburg, which, occurring at the same time as the surrender of Vicksburg, marked the turning point of the war. The movie accurately follows the historical novel \\"The Killer Angels\\". It is a very balanced movie, showing the battle from both sides, casting no stones and showing how heroic stubbornness on both sides both won and lost important phases of the battle. The theatrical version of the movie is over three hours long, but was so engrossing I didn't realize how much time had passed until the movie ended. Over 5,000 reenactors, with authentic reproductions of Civil War equipment and uniforms, gave realistic, crowded battlefield scenes, the line has rarely been seen before. Authentic tactics were used, also, and just like in the real battles, the black powder smoke made it difficult to see the battle field. A great story, well told, and with no obvious blunders (like using the wrong vintage of firearms) to mar the enjoyment. A must for all civil war buffs!
0345501292|5.0|Rinzler and Bouzereau continue their fantastic documentation of Lucasfilms. As was their intention, the focus is on Raiders, but all Indiana Jones feature installments are covered. Crystal Skull gets the least coverage as the movie was being completed concurrent to the book, but even that has a lot of information about the pre-production and shooting.<br /><br />Reading this book and watching the 2004 DVD documentaries (and the 2008 CS one) really satisfies any fans' or scholars' quest for Indiana Jones background. I'd actually give it 1/2 a star less if this system allowed it because the story can't be definitive till Crystal Skull gets complete coverage.<br /><br />Also, this book was never sold in hardcover in the US, so if you want this in hardback you may wish to spring for a UK or Canadian copy.
055380684X|5.0|This was an absolutely fantastic book where Coyle compiled extensive research into a concise, extremely clear and entertaining guidebook that describes powerfully how talent is made. I believe this is a breakthrough book that will help dispel the popular but flawed notions that talent is simply a product of genetics + environment.<br /><br />Anyone who is a coach or performer will benefit tremendously from this work. Coyle reports that he spent two years traveling and researching the book, and its clear that his efforts benefit the reader with an excellent summary of what could become an overly complex topic. There is a bit of topic crossover with Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, but I believe this book is better. Some of Gladwell's premises seem to be pulled out of thin air and then an argument constructed to support them (eg - similar birthdates of top hockey players giving them an advantage by being older in the youth age divisions is a weak argument in my opinion). Coyle engages in no such shortcuts. He explains the theories methodically and refraining from making editorial conclusions that are not supported with enough research or expert commentary.<br /><br />I do agree that Coyle has glossed over the importance of some genetic factors, both physical and mental, in favor of highlighting the development of myelin in the nervous system as the end all to becoming talented. There are people that can pick up a golf club or tennis racquet and become competent immediately, owing to remarkable and rare genetic gifts. And there are people who can received detailed instruction, practice deeply as detailed in the book, and hit an performance ceiling lower than they hope.<br /><br />Similarly, the discussion of \\"Ignition\\" - igniting the passion to engage in Deep Practice, focuses on environmental factors like coaches, being surrounded by successful people, being low in the birth order or having traumatic circumstances like death or parent to \\"drive\\" one to achieve. I think some of this is reaching just to advance a theory...There are plenty of only children, eldest siblings, and kids with privileged backgrounds who have high \\"Ignition\\". Look at Kobe Bryant for one. Nevertheless, the entertainment value of the work is excellent and provocative, even if you may have a counter-opinion.<br /><br />This book comes on the heels of another Coyle book I greatly enjoyed, \\"Lance Armstrong's War\\" from 2005.g just to advance a theory...There are plenty of only children, eldest siblings, and kids with privileged backgrounds who have high \\"Ignition\\".

0321543726|4.0|After reading a lot of these reviews, I decided to purchase this book for myself, as I'm switching over to C++ from Java.  I thought it would help me really beef up on some of the more C++ concepts, but I didn't find it very advanced at all. If you already know programming and the basic concepts of memory management, this book is not very helpful.  It seems like a nice book for someone relatively new to programming, though.

B00127I3SQ|1.0|I quite like Simple Plan's first two albums and their pop-punk-rock style. I was very disappointed with this new album. The production introduced electrocic elements and backing vocals effects in the first six songs that turned Simple Plan into Backstreet Boys.    From the seventh track (which is very good) on, I could recognize Simple Plan, but most of them are ballads.
B00078XGRO|5.0|I'll be honest--I'm not a good movie reviewer.  Out of the hundreds of films I've seen, I can count on one hand those that I felt aren't good.  Motion pictures are an art form, created with many hands to achieve a product that, I believe, is completely subjective.<br /><br />I'll also go ahead and say that I have always been an avid fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, so it follows that I will obviously like their feature films.  I'm biased, in other words, so stop reading now if you want an objective review.<br /><br />Despite how well the movie was received by critics, how much money it made at the box office's opening weekend, or any other quantitative method for computing a film's success, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie immensely.  Sure, the destruction of the borg ship in the beginning seemed a little too easily handled and the subsequent time travel to the past (and back to the future at the end) also seemed a little too conveniently done.  Especially given how difficult it has been in Star Trek's past to time travel, one is left to wonder why, after discovering how easy it is by the end of this film, Starfleet doesn't use it all the time, pun intended.<br /><br />Despite those two plot conveniences, this really is a good action-adventure.  Not very much technobabble, for those who hate it in the series and earlier films, and it's also quite accessible for anyone new to the franchise as a whole.  One might argue that watching the episodes \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I & II\\" are necessary before seeing this film, but I disagree.  Just as seeing \\"Space Seed\\" (ST:TOS) isn't necessary before watching \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\\" it does, admittedly, offer more flavor and backstory.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Excellent action-adventure movie.  Not much meat or drama, but a good romp for anyone who just wants to have a fun time.
0743496736|4.0|I enjoyed this book, though not as much as her best work, My Sister's Keeper.  It kept me interested from start to finish, although I found the ending a bit disappointing.  Still, worth reading.
0307266303|4.0|I have to ditto other readers who said this book changed their life.  And that is not hyperbole.  Prior to reading this book I viewed myself as a fast short distance runner and I rarely, if ever, ran more than 3 miles at a time.  I felt this was just the way things were and that I should accept it.<br /><br />\\"Born to Run\\" completely changed my internal thought process about running.  I was already aware of the running shoe issue.  I've been slowly using Vibram Five Fingers for over a year and I've been trying to alter my gate from heel strike first to toe strike first.  I found that it just takes patience and time to adapt in getting those muscles developed.  McDougall is no liar - we've been screwed over by the running shoe companies.  The first time I ran with the Vibram's I could barely walk for a week I was in so much pain.  Now I can climb mountains in them.<br /><br />What changed for me after reading this book was just the simple notion that I wasn't limited by some personal flaw or lack of will.  I was failing to run longer distances because both my mindset and my running style were flawed.  One, we can all run farther than we think.  Two, don't get obsessed over speed or time, just run at a pace that feels comfortable.  Your body will tell you when you can step it up a notch.  In other words, just enjoy the experience.<br /><br />Before I started the book my max was 3 miles with a hard push on the first two.  Five weeks after reading the book I can now do 8 miles or more.  I can probably do 10 or more now, but haven't pushed because I'm still working on getting those calve muscles stronger and adapted to the new running style.  Don't get me wrong - I'm running slow! But wow, does it feel good.  I'm enjoying running more and I feel better than ever before.  My blood pressure, which was high, is now below normal and I feel great. One of the points McDougall makes in the book is that many experienced ultra runners don't run that fast.  Many of them are just doing 10 minute miles.  That's part of what caused me to rethink my obsession over speed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as a few critics have pointed out, McDougall's book does come off as hyperbole in some parts.  I also strongly disliked his focus on extremists.  \\"Barefoot Ted\\" is one example.<br /><br />Just search the net for the term \\"barefoot running\\" and you'll find some of the most absurd absolutist garbage about how the only way to run is barefoot and anyone who stoops to using shoes (even the likes of Nike Free shoes or the Vibram's) is misguided or even stupid.  The sad reality is that we have all been lied to by the shoe companies - Nike especially.  These lies are pushed on us by the alleged \\"experts.\\"  I recently picked up a pair of Nike Hayward Prefontaine runners.  \\"Runners World\\" gave them a mixed review and slammed the shoe for not having enough support.  So we have the barefoot absolutists telling us to ditch our shoes and we have the mainstream press telling us we need to wear the very shoes that are making us weaker runners. And the accepted normal shoes do make us weaker - I was told by a doctor after two major ankle injuries that I'd be limping for life if I was injured again.  That ankle is the strongest it has ever been after changing my running style.<br /><br />You don't change people's minds by using extremists to make your case.  And that's unfortunately what comes across at times in McDougall's book.  I would have personally preferred more information about his personal transformation and less on the likes of \\"Barefoot Bob\\" and the other runners who share very little in common with everyday people who just want to get into shape.<br /><br />I don't think \\"Born to Run\\" is going to be that interesting to those who are already hardcore runners.  The more you already run, the more the hyperbole will stick out.  But I do recommend the book to those who thought like I did about what was physically possible for them.  After reading this book you won't be able to watch a marathon again and think of how it's beyond your abilities.  You won't make it into the Olympics, but the odds are you can run a marathon.<br /><br />And speaking of marathons, McDougall makes an earth shattering point about older runners and their ability to outrun teenagers.  The age at which you can beat a teenager (in long distance running), assuming you've trained appropriately, will blow your mind.  Since it's one of McDougall's \\"secrets\\" I won't post the spoiler here.  It's just one of his many points that will make you rethink your own ability to run.<br /><br />EDIT: I have to scoff at all the critics of this book who say to take it all with a grain of salt.  Each person is obviously different so your mileage will vary.  Nonetheless, the central message in McDougall's book is that YOU can run and you can run longer distances than you think.<br /><br />I served in the Army and I was a runner in high school.  And yet, at almost 40 - with heart disease and a stent implant! - I'm now running longer distances than I have ever run in my life.  One of the reasons is simply because I took McDougall's advice.  I'll never run ultra-marathons, but that doesn't matter.<br /><br />There are nuggets of truth and inspiration in this book along with all the exaggerations.  If you're already a long distance runner there's very little meat for you to digest and the hyperbole will annoy.  But if you're one of the many people who've never gone more than a few miles there's a powerful message here.<br /><br />I now can outrun all 3 of my nephews (15 to 24) nephews in the long distance.  On one fast 4.5 mile mountain hike (Mt. Monadnock in NH) I beat my athletic 15 year old nephew by more than 3 minutes.  He led the entire run/hike until the end when I left him in the dust after he ran out of steam.  He had the speed, I had the stamina - just like McDougall presents it in his book.
B0000029PC|5.0|I have found the reviews of typical classical music listeners to be of greater value most times then those of the established golden ears in the published guides.    I wanted to make a few observations.  First, I am not a George Szell fan. Keep in mind, though, that the Schumann Symphony recordings are over 50-years old.  It is really outstanding what the engineers are doing with the old tapes.  I don't expect miracles with the original recordings made at the beginning of the stero era.  There is a wonderful interview online with the engineering team currently remastering the RCA two and three channel recordings from the early 1950's and 1960's.  It is amazing what can be done today with the deteriorating master tapes.    My next observation has to do with the packaging of the Schumann Symphonies.  I agree 100 percent that getting the CD's in and out of these cardboard sleeves is ridiculous.  This applies also to other products like the Mozart Piano Concertos on the Sony label.  There isn't even a slot in the sleeve to help ease the CD from its jacket.  Poor engineering to say the least.    To conclude, I realize this isn't exactly a music review but I wanted to put in my two cents regarding some comments printed in the above reviews. I give all the reviewers 5-stars for the insight they bring to the classical genre here on Amazon.

I fell in love with the Directors' Cut of this movie, on an older issue two-sided DVD.    This is NOT that DVD.  They have compressed both versions to the extent that they fit on a single side.    I'm sure this saves Newline some bucks.  But it essentially ruins the video.  Just AWFUL.  Many scenes show heavy macroblock tiling.  Additionally, I ran into some playback problems with the MacOS DVD Player application as well as VLC.    Bottom line: very good movie, skip this edition.

0517548232|5.0|For someone that was never really into economics (which is why I bought the  book) this book just fascinated me.  Straight from the Ludwig von Mises school of thinking, this book made me realize one very important thing that most people that claim to know what they are talking about don't understand: economics is a science.    For everyone that has had basic science, they understand the concept of laws.  Physics has laws. Chemistry has laws. All sciences have laws, including economics.  Reading this book (in early 2009) I would have thought that it was written shortly after the mortgage crisis of late 2008. Hazlitt wrote this book 60 years ago!  Everything in the book could have been analogous to the current economic environment.      My words cannot fully describe how intelligent, on target, and somewhat prophetic this book is, as it releates today.  If you are even thinking about learning the first detail about economics, this is the only starting point for you.

I almost never object to a lot of \\"bells and whistles\\" that are skillfully woven into the music. Simplicity for simplicity's sake is absurd.     I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to this album for a couple of months now. Stand out tracks include \\"Psychotic Girl\\" (is that a banjo?) and \\"Lies.\\" Listen to the lyrics of \\"Lies.\\" I think that's how we all want to go.    The Black Keys remind me a little of Joe South with a heavy dose of blues infused. Dan Auerbach's vocals give the tunes a quality of suffering that has been endured and overcome.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Melodically beautiful! Modern, soothing and lyrically beautiful Jazz.  The arrangements remind me of modern boleros (old-school Spanish love songs). I cannot stop listening to her! This sophomore album is her best yet- 'Les Etoiles', 'Who will Comfort Me', & 'Our Love is Easy' exude vulnerability and peace. While I have never been much of a fan of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow,' this is the only version that I can listen to over and over- again, the arrangement and Miss Gardot's musical style give this old song a new life.
B0002XMF5I|5.0|This is a must have Sabbath disc a bit dark and hoary from Disturbing the priest,Digital Bitch,Zero the Hero. This is a classic Black Sabbath album and even better on disc, so glad I bought it
0439796636|5.0|When my reading-obsessed son turned to me and said, \\"this is the best book I've ever read\\", I knew I'd have to read it too!  What a beautiful story.  This book is as wonderful for an adult as it is for a 10 year old boy.  I highly recommend it for all ages!
B000WC3A0S|4.0|Great box, comes with Rocky Balboa.    I missed the special features stuff.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List is one of my all time favorite movies. Truely a sad story but one that sticks in your mind. What a great man Schindler was giving up everything he had to help save those people
031606792X|2.0|Really really stupid storyline but I had to give it two stars just for the fact that it made me keep reading the story to see what silly thing the author would do next. Still couldn't put this one down.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Although I wish Diana would have included \\"Cry Me a River\\", and a few of her other string included ballads, (over some of the more \\"swing\\" like stuff), the CD part of this 2-disc set is pretty good, over all.      I'd have given it four stars, but since it includes a pretty good DVD as well, (both at a good price), I'd have to rate the set a \\"five\\".      Although the DVD starts with a couple of music videos, I really like the live-to-tape/video performances, (in what appears to be perhaps Diana's sun room, spare room, foyer, or what have you), with Diana's usual, strangely charming, almost lethargic, yet genuinely heartfelt manner and sincere style.      Thank goodness \\"Popsicle Toes\\" wasn't on it! I wouldn't have bought it!
1595141979|5.0|I am a definite fan of Twilight saga but Richelle Mead is a much better writer. She goes into detail with everything. They start to get repetitive but I started reading the 3rd book first not knowing there were other books. Even though I started with the 3rd book I still understood what happened so the backgroun information was good. I just wish she would've numbered the series! Other than that I love the book and can't wait for the next one.
0743497465|5.0|Read this book in under a week, very easy read.  If you an interested in encryption, NSA, hacking, and geek love, give this book a try.  The ending was a little too \\"video game\\"-like for me, but over all the book held my interest and was entertaining.
031606792X|5.0|The material here is alluded to in the first book: Twilight. Read the series in order; each new element that is added to vampire lore builds into this final segment. I wondered about the continued lingering presence of Jacob. With this story, it all makes sense.
0451197968|4.0|i found the book to be very exciting and fast-paced, but i unfortunately read the preface \\"the importance of being Bauchman\\" which tells the ending of the book...  so i you do decide to read this book, read the preface (which is quite interesting) AFTERWARDS
B000M343BM|5.0|Major League is a simple movie with a premise you've seen from literally hundreds of sports movies.  A bunch of losers come together and stink, then through hard work and plucky leadership, they start to win.  This movie isn't Field of Dreams or Bull Durham, it is most comparable to Paul Newman's classic Slap Shot.<br /><br />The thing that elevates Major League over the competion in the screwball sports movie category is the pure mastery of the script and performances by the cast.  Bob Uecker steals every scene as Harry Doyle, the alcoholic announcer and Wesley Snipes gives the best performance of his career as Willie Mayes Hayes.<br /><br />The baseball is not terribly realistic, yet the movie actually captures the feeling of a city on the downturn with the unexpected heroes making a run for it.<br /><br />From the opening scene of the movie, you know exactly how it will end, but the journey there leads to one of the funniest and most quotable sports movies of our time.<br /><br />Even 20 years later this one holds up.
B0024F08RO|5.0|This is most certainly the best of the four series.  There are so many twists and turns to keep you riveted to the screen and then comes a very unexpected and surprising ending. Fabulous!!!!! I can't wait to watch it all over again.
B000002BQK|5.0|Listening to this album takes me back to 1997 and all the memories I had of that year. Butterfly is truly one of her best albums and her most personal. The theme of this album talks about her freedom and stepping more into her womanhood. I would say its equivalent to Janet's Velvet Rope which dealt with depression, homosexuality, and bondage and Madonna's Ray of Light which dealt with rebirth, spirituality, and motherhood. All three of those albums have their own symbols. They're all my favorite.<br /><br />1. Honey - i love the title of this song and the song itself. this song shows Mariah coming out of her shell. it was a new beginning for her. It's a great opening track. 5/5<br /><br />2. Butterfly - when i was in private school back then, i remember the 5th grade class was singing this song for their graduation. my school liked to sing inspirational songs. i think this was the first time i heard this song. it's such a beautiful song. 5/5<br /><br />3. My All - i love the sensual tone in this song especially the video. 5/5<br /><br />4. The Roof - everytime i hear this song, i got nyc in my mind. i could just picture the the new york city life in my head. it just has this really cool, laidback vibe to it. 5/5<br /><br />5. Fourth of July - this song really does remind me of \\"Underneath the Stars\\". their theme sounds pretty similar.  those songs remind me of summer. 5/5<br /><br />6. Breakdown - this song if definitely one of the best from this album. 5/5<br /><br />7. Babydoll - it kinda sounds a little like aaliyah's one in a million. it's a great rnb song. it channels the popular rnb in the 90s. 5/5<br /><br />8. Close My Eyes - i love the melody and flow of this song. 5/5<br /><br />9. Whenever You Call - a very sweet ballad. 4/5<br /><br />10. Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise) - Nice dance mix<br /><br />11. The Beautiful Ones - i love this remake...mariah and dru hill sound good together. and i just love the background music. 5/5<br /><br />12. Outside - this song is very relatable to me and to anyone who feels like an \\"outsider\\". 5/5g is very relatable to me and to anyone who feels like an \\"outsider\\". 5/5
B001M5UDGS|5.0|For those not familiar with the concept, Dr. Horrible is a romantic super-villain musical, which is just as bizarre and charming as it sounds. It's written and directed by Joss Whedon (of Buffy/Angel/Firefly/Serenity fame), who is a man who knows how to put together some tight, polished, good quality entertainment.    I suppose the important things for the DVD review are the region code and the extras. This DVD is region-free; I don't remember reading that in the product description, so held off on buying it for ages waiting for a European release, but it should work on any DVD player around the world. Also, the extras make the DVD well worth purchasing. \\"Commentary: The Musical\\" is great fun, hearing the cast and crew bicker through the medium of song; and the application videos for the Evil League of Evil are entertaining, and show the kind of level of effort enthused Whedon fans go to.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is one hour and forty minutes and made its movie debut on May 30, 2003. The story plot is about tiny Clown Fish named Nemo who is capture and his dad goes to rescue him. That is the story in a nutshell. The long version goes like this. Marlin and Coral are looking over there eggs and are deciding what to name them and swim back into there home and start to swim around and have fun. Coral swims out of her home and Marlin gives chase and when he turns around Marlin spots a barracuda. Marlin tries to fight off the barracuda, but is knocked out cold. When he awakens, he sadly discovers that the barracuda has eaten his wife and children. Marlin finds one egg that is a little damage and names him Nemo and take cares of the egg.

Nemo runs into Dory and the two look for Marlin. The three of the finally hook up and live happy ever after.

B000R6PKP2|5.0|I first viewed blade runner at a young age on TV. I caught the film about half way through, the score by Vangelis to this day is my most played CD. I was hooked by the ambience & overall look of this film instantly. The narrative is weak, but that's this film's only true weakness. A film without any CGI effect's that still looks this great is only all the more awesome on blu-ray.This is a reminder of how awful many modern movies SFX can look due to a heavy reliance on CGI. If you have invested in a good home theater set up then you will reap the benefits with this transfer of Blade Runner. You will forget this film was released in 1982, the picture & true digital sound could not be better. The extras are a fan's dream come true, worth the price of admission alone (over 3 hours of documentry material). I had last seen this movie many years ago & recall it like a dream. And that's what this edition is...buy this if your a fan, it's an absolute must own.
0679721037|5.0|I read this 160 page book in an afternoon and thoroughly enjoyed it. Having read a number of historical works on the Pacific War, I was full bottle on the political and military reasons for the action. But Hersey surprised me in two key areas: he wrote the original work in 1946, so it was all raw narrative & he nor his subjects made little comment on the morality of the weapon - he just told their stories. The final chapter - written 40 years on - gives the book its closing credits.<br /><br />You don't need to be a war history buff to get something great out of this little book. I visited Hiroshima in 2008 and found the city to be booming, yet scarred. It was surreal to stand at the hypo-centre of the blast and visit the A-Bomb Dome. The Peace Park was amazing - packed with local people, not just tourists. The book touched on all these locations.
6304806426|5.0|There is no weak link in this film.  For my money, Scott Thomas and Fiennes give two of the most powerful performances in motion picture history.  Every gesture, every word of every exchange, feels perfect and more importantly, natural.  It's amazing chemistry coupled with amazing talent.  The other performances are just as strong.  The score is brilliant, as is the directing, and cinematography.  I often complain about films not living up to Oscar hype.  This film lives up to the hype.

0374530718|5.0|I thought taking an online philosophy class would be quite difficult. But the book assigned made this class easy to take. Sophie's World breaks down philosophy in a way where it is so clear to understand. This book presented the ideas of  difficult thinkers such as Descartes, Aristole, Plato, Socrates, Nietzsche, Herclitus, Empedocles, and many more in such a way where anyone could understand it.     I would this book to anyone who is interested in philosophy and even someone just looking for a good reading.    Tayler
1416914307|5.0|I couldn't wait until this book had come out since I was dying to know what the ending would be like and Clare did not disappoint at all. She is so detailed on her scenarios that captivated me to want to be in the world she imagined for her characters. There were parts of the story where I could not put the book down and I always love that happy ending---especially when I wasn't expecting one until the very end!!
B001V9LRV0|4.0|well i bought the 50 dollar round can target version with 4 dvds and the dvd with the dead and credence well thats the way woodstock should look and sound now...darn the dead footage was great but dark... the regular film is just dated and the picture needs to be redone with new multi track sound and film print refurbished with todays HD technology. they need to take all these tin can reels and put ALL the stage footage on all alone dvd's and the field footage on dvd's by itself. i understand having it tied together...but come on. I wonder what was shot on all the bands..I know everything wasn't shot on stage but theres got to be more in that vault. maybe everything was shot but ten acts they can leave it in the cans like quill melanie some of the others ...was the whole who concert shot...would be awesome..i say most of the bands I would like to see everything they shot.<br />the 40th box could of been 10 dvd's with everything thats release able...<br />im just tired of the movie...i seen it so many times...we want discs like that 2 hour bonus dvd with mountain dead credence cocker who butterfield winter and etc and more of it...and no more split screens
0307454541|4.0|The character development in Larsson's first novel is unbeatable. The first few chapters paint a picture of an interesting, complicated young girl who has spent her life feeling like a freak due to her unexplainable intelligence and photographic memory. Though Larsson never confirms she has Asperger's Syndrome, it's mentioned as one reason Lisbeth Salander -- ward of the state, turned amateur detective -- so effectively helps a journalist resurrect his reputation, his career and his magazine.<br /><br />While the plot is rather deep and complicated, Larsson does a wonderful job of providing enough information for the reader to follow the plot without going overboard.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because the translation to English is flawed in a few places. It's a bit difficult to follow the Swedish names and locations in the beginning, but once the reader becomes familiar with the primary locations, it's much easier to follow.<br /><br />I can't wait to read his follow up novel, The Girl Who Played with Fire.
0007172826|2.0|This book was recommended by a friend. The story never captured my imagination, or even got very interesting to me. Nothing much happened outside the head of a young girl servant.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|Outside the supernova explosions of the early Jackson 5, Michael Jackson's peak years were '80-'82 of Off The Wall and Thriller. In fact, Thriller and its breakthrough, extended-length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run. Those years, also, however, hosted rebellions against that same mainstream, with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions. A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap, top-down thinking and the pop band as commodity/tool. Michael Jackson was anything but staid, but he was of them. I mean, Quincy Jones! Industry creation though he was, Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach his creative zenith, plunging his music into the currency of sexual politics well-beyond the dance floor blatherings that typically decorate even genius killer grooves. He produced the toughest, most sophisticated work of his career in \\"Billie Jean.\\" That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilites of sex. But as big as Thriller was, Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident, at-ease sexuality of Off the Wall and his hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on. The opening Jackson 5 bombs detonate here as if preparing you, and the big early 80's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement. This holds well up into \\"Bad,\\" opening the second CD, then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarassing schlock. And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire \\"Dangerous,\\" which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince. The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run, shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs. I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding.
4770030096|3.0|I have used this text for my introductory course, and must say that compared to Genki, I find Busy People I to be lacking.  The vocabulary is alright, and if you get the kana version it is superior to trying to muddle through with the romaji crutch.  However, I find the exercises to be repetitive and non-educational.  For each exercise, an example is given.  All the student is asked to do is fill in the blanks to repeat the same thing with different people / places / things for the 3 exercises that follow.  That is great for practicing writing kana--but not much else.  A person can literally complete the exercises without learning the grammatical point that is supposed to be learned in the section.<br /><br />Unless your class requires this book, I'd suggest looking at Genki or Minna no Nihongo--both far superior books that I've relied on as supplements.  An added advantage with those texts is early introduction to kanji.

B001GQV5VU|1.0|Once again, I have wasted money on a DVD that proclaims that is going to show me the hottest Brazilian women. This was the biggest waste of them all.    What this is, essentially, is a documentary with some really bad footage of a beach and a parade that may or may not be Carnaval. For whatever reason the cameras pick out, seemingly, the least-attractive half-naked women who are at each venue. Spliced in with this footage (the same portions of which are used more than once) are subtitled interviews with some of the ugliest Brazilian women I've ever seen, a couple of whom get naked in their rooms and show us more of themselves than we wanted to see.    I guess if you like really homely, really really dark Brazilian women (nothing like the ones on the cover), you might like this. But if you're the average soft-core viewer, you're going to be mad that you wasted your time. I actually fast forwarded through the last half and I never do that.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|Forget Sorkin's politics and enjoy the craft. You'll have to do similar arm's length separation if you're a feminist or hate smokers or hate men who run around on their wives. It's a glimpse into the 50's and 60's when advertising grew up and made us a \\"Nation of Sheep.\\" Were offices really like this? Yes, see \\"Desk Set\\" or any other office based film to see how women were valued and the term \\"WASP\\" was really applied to hiring. Sure they jam a lot into 50+ minutes, but this was Madison Avenue and how the \\"suburbs\\" got stereotyped. Don't sharpshoot the details, just sit back and enjoy watching how real brand names became \\"branded\\" in our psyche. Great acting, great writing make for splendid theater. Perfect for watching on your iPhone on an airplane, too.

B0029358GM|3.0|First, the good news.  Wilco (The Album) represents a return to form after 2007's mellow (translation:  comatose) Sky Blue Sky.  This album is much more lively and engaging than their previous effort and there are more hooks and memorable melodies to be found.  Now the bad news.  Wilco (The Album) is still sub-par Wilco; paling in comparison to the back to back artistic homeruns of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born.  However, asking Jeff Tweedy and company to turn in a third effort comparible with those two is a tall order.<br /><br />One of the great things about Wilco is how they have progressed from album to album.  Just go back and listen to their debut, the poppy, alt-country, A.M. and then follow their arc all the way to 2004's A Ghost is Born and what will be most striking is how they not only grew as musicians and songwriters, but also how each record sounded different.  That all came to a screeching halt with Sky Blue Sky which found the band sounding bored with their art for the first time.<br /><br />So yes, Wilco (The Album) does recapture some of the group's artistic ambitiousness while maintaining some of Sky Blue Sky's straightforward vibe.  The opening track, \\"Wilco (the song)\\" mixes dark lyrics with a tounge in cheek nod to fans as Tweedy reassures fans that Wilco will love them.  It's one of the odder entries into the band's catalog, but it works.  Meanwhile, \\"You Never Know\\" and \\"I'll Fight\\" are some of the band's catchiest tunes in years.  The rest of the material doesn't stand out as much, but repeated listens do reveal intelligent, searching lyrics and subtle hooks.  Neither of those were anywhere to be found on Sky Blue Sky.<br /><br />Wilco's creative streak may be over, but as the song title states, \\"You never know\\".  Tweedy is bound to deliver something completely new and original next time out.  If not, at least he and his band don't seem resigned to merely releasing an endless array of variations on Sky Blue Sky.  Wilco loves us all too much for that.

B0028NSE5K|4.0|This 1983 live performance summit between a legend and a soon-to-be legend has been reissued a few times on CD, including a hybrid SACD in 2003. This latest CD is a remastered reissue of the original eleven tracks and includes three sets of liner notes. At the time the pair met in a Canadian TV studio, Vaughan was blazing a trail into the blues world with his debut album, [[ASIN:B00000ICN5 Texas Flood]]. King was long since a legend in the blues world, and though he didn't recognize the name \\"Vaughan,\\" he immediately recognized the guitarist who'd sat in with him whenever he played in Austin. Snippets of dialogue interspersed between the tracks do a good job of showing the personal bond that complemented the guitar slingers' deep artistic connections.<br /><br />King and Vaughan are backed by the former's tack sharp road band, and run through a set drawn almost entirely from King's catalog. You can hear what was on the horizon, though, as Vaughan rips into his own \\"Pride and Joy\\" with monster tone and a gutsy vocal. Throughout the session the players trade licks and prod each other with solos that quote all the great players from whom they learned. King's influence is clear in Vaughan's playing, but hearing them side-by-side (the recording does a nice job of keeping their guitars separated slightly left and right) gives listeners an opportunity to hear how the same fundamentals change as they filter through different fingers and hardware.<br /><br />As free as both guitarists play, the band, the catalog, and the deference Vaughan shows King all tipped in favor of the latter orchestrating the pacing. This is a master class, King leading the way with his guitar and providing verbal tips in between songs. In any other venue Vaughan would be the master, but here he plays the role of apprentice. How many chances do you get to play with someone who can introduce \\"Blues at Sunrise\\" with \\"This is that thing, uh, I recorded with Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin out there at the Fillmore West\\"? It was a good time to be the apprentice. Anyone who loves King, Vaughan or great blues guitar should catch this one. 4-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

Some of these reviews state the same others say A couple of songs let you down,No WAY!!This is a thriller of a cd. If you by this and dont like it , then this type of music is not your forte, However if you like smooth jazz, cool melodies and a sexy voice unlike anything else out there then Buy it, You cannot go wrong!

B00140PK6O|4.0|I am a big fan Of Jane Austen. Sadly she only wrote 6 major works-which I have read and re-read those novels numerous times. I have also re-watched and re-watched the various adaptations.<br /><br /> I needed \\"new\\" material!<br /><br />It was recommended to me by a Janeite that I watch this. I had missed the PBS airing, and so I rented this through Netflix. Well I enjoyed this enough that I bought this through Amazon.<br /><br />This is based on three novellas of Elizabeth Gaskell. Cranford, Doctor Harrison's Confession, and My Lady Ludlow. (which I read after I saw this)<br /><br />I felt the two \\"Sue's\\" (Conklin and Birtwistle) did a wonderful job of weaving these 3 stories together.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like was there were a couple of accidents in this story-and I found these were portrayed a little too graphic for my taste. Otherwise(if you are not squeamish like me)this was a \\"G\\" story all the way and suitable for the whole family to watch.
0452289963|5.0|The book's content is of course old material rearranged...its source is the core to every major religion even if it is often (incorrectly) identified as Eastern or some sort of Buddhism.  At least one went so far as to describe it as Anti-Christian!  Nothing could be further from Truth.  The author does such a great job in his even more refined clarity and style that, rather than criticizing it in any way due to the fact that nothing in it is new, let us praise the presentation.  There seems to be a huge following for a review that does the former, a \\"one star\\" one, that even attacks the author's character.  Whatever, the basis for such criticism just seems to prove the author's points, LOL.  I think this is easily a classic book, one of the very best in its area, and I am glad the vast majority of those who read it agree with me.  Thank you ET, please do not go home!  :-)

B000FVE3AC|5.0|I bought this on Amazon after looking around the internet for a few weeks. It arrived faster than the tracking numbers indicated! Amazon continues to impress me.   The Invicta Grand Diver is awesome. It looks like a million bucks. The small details like the logo on the second hand, divers on the band and engraving really set it apart from other divers. The size and weight are truly outstanding for a watch that costs less than $200, and it seems well constructed.   This watch is now the workhorse of my collection of 15 watches. It keeps good time for a Japanese auto movement and holds a charge for about 36 hours. I do not use a winder for this watch, just wind it when I want to wear it and go.  UPDATE! I got a winder from Brookstone and it keeps the watch accurate.  If I go a few days between wearing the time difference is non-existant. When it sat while I was away for 2 weeks it was only off by a minute or two.    Overall, I would recommend it, but I do not want anyone else to have one and take attention away from mine!
B000M2E43U|4.0|The CD jacket was pretty beat up, but the actual CD was fine.  Shipping was average; within the time limit, but still not as fast as I would have liked it.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|It's a fun watch - definitely for a mature adult audience.  But the books are better. And don't try to read to books AND watch this - they don't match up.
0316017922|5.0|An insightful , profound book, helpful for parents of young children, educational for young adults as they prepare for their futures and profound for anyone interested in learning that successful individuals get that way through repetition of skills and adaptability to circumstances. This is a must read for those interested in improving their behavior, self image and success in life.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|Thirty years later and Halloween still remains incredibly relevant. It's still intense, and it's still a classic. Few horror movies can withstand the test of time as well as John Carpenter's Masterpiece. The reason it still works today? Simple...the story is steeped in realism and it's a situation that everybody can relate to. It boils down to that primal fear that a psycho really might be lurking in the shadows...waiting to hack you to bits.<br /><br />Though several people die, Halloween doesn't really rely on gore to spook audiences. Rather it features brilliant photography that deftly places \\"The Shape\\" in the background of several scenes (usually accompanied by some disconcerting synth sound effect). It helps create this palpable tension that makes you weary a crazed maniac is creeping around every dark corner. The atmosphere benefits heavily from Carpenter's pulse pounding iconic score. You really feel as though you're part of the chase scenes and it's easy to find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Halloween is THE archetypal slasher movie as it practically laid the foundation of the genre for years to come. I suggest picking this one up on Blu Ray since it's arguably the best version available. No horror movie collection is complete without this one.<br /><br />Final Grade: A+
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This Jane Eyre, at least for me, conveys the  emotional core of the story with far more realism, depth and force than any other version BY FAR.  It's in a class all it's own.  Yes of course it is changed and cut as any movie length adaption must be but it remains in my opinion very faithful to the essence and the form of the original.  It is also true that there is a \\"modern\\" sense to the adaption which in my opinion is a very good thing and conveys the story far better than any previous effort.   The fact that some people think there is \\"too much sex\\" tends to confirm my judgment.  What did they think was going on?
1563890119|5.0|This story is one of the best comics I have ever read.  I am typically a follower of the superhero genre of stories.  This book portrays a completely new comic experience with me.  The story is deep and fulfilling.  The story also gives a nod to real world events and fits them into the Sandman mythos.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the Vertigo imprint, DC comic characters, and those looking for a new experence from comics and literature in general.

B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|This new movie was certainly interesting though complicated. I am still trying to puzzle out lines like \\"I am not our father.\\" And how did he re-program the Yamahashi Neru (sp?)test? If the red stuff caused so much problems how was it safe inside a glass tube? If Scottie new how to do that stuff then how come he didn't use it for all sorts of things later? Since when did Uhura have a thing for Spock? Who was the green lady? Why did Pavlov have trouble with \\"v\\"s? Are we set for future movies that replace missing planets and people? Remember the whales! Is the moral narrative that multiethnicity is better than prejudice? Hate turns against those who hate. Or perhaps being a bad boy is a great way to get ahead?

1416950176|5.0|I am glad that these books have been made available to us but as I read them I cannot help but wonder if the kids that found the guide were not very wise ignoring the order to burn the book! Were they courageous or crazy? I do not know.
0307278255|4.0|The stories in this collection will tug at your heartstrings as the people face different life situations. Perhaps it is the author's ability to describe things so well that one feels the emotion or as if they are in a particular place that kept me reading. My favourite of all the stories is Hema and Kaushik two people who are reluctantly brought together briefly as children through a family friendship. They grow up only to meet later in life in very different circumstances and find that they still share alot despite being on separate paths. Overall, a really good read!

B001WCN23W|1.0|Why the Stones felt the need to compress these new remasters to make them so much louder is beyond me.  This CD has a dynamic range of about 8db.  Everything has been compressed to make the average volume louder.  Try the new Rod Stewart remasters of A Night on the Town and Atlantic Crossing, which were not compressed to increase the volume, to see what might have been with these new Stones remasterings.  I actually like the EQ choices Stephen Marcussen made in the remastering of this and the other Stones remasters, but the lack of dynamic range and compression ruin it.  No bonus tracks and a loudness war remastering make this one a loser for me.  Stick with the Ludwig remasters from '94 or the original CBS/Columbia CDs (the latter of which are unfairly maligned IMHO).  Let's not reward this type of remastering.
B002BIULQ2|4.0|My daughters are 6 and 8. I was so pleasantly surprised by how much all 3 of us enjoyed this movie. This is classic Disney fun, corny humor, and tons of heart. The main 'moral' of the story is the importance of honoring the love of family and friends. We listen to the soundtrack together frequently, and all 3 of us are looking forward to the DVD release of the film so we can watch it togther again...and again!
B001PPLIFU|2.0|Not a regular James Bond Movie . Previous one was much better.<br /><br />James bond in this movie needs some anger management class. He was upset in most of the scene and would kill all his leads. He didn't made any smart move to get the information .<br /><br />Action wasn't that great .<br /><br />I will never watch this movie again .
B000002HPV|5.0|I don't love everything Bjork does, but I love that she does everything. Here is a great example of what an artist can do when she's left alone. And her music is truly a work of art. One never thinks of Bjork as a female artist - she's a creative force and one of the best musical visionaries of all time. I consider this her best work because she covers every conceivable emotion. She apologizes for nothing, demanding from her objects of affection to man up or hit the road. 'Immature' is the best advice ever, while 'All is Full of Love' wonderfully suggests we stop expecting love from 'the sources you've poured yours'. Bjork just wants us to get out of the box, take the plunge, and not be afraid to admit life can and does go on.

It is kind of slow and then catches it ...<br /><br />This is another war-on-terror thriller ,same old subject . I have given 3 star , nothing new in the movie except the powerful performace from DiCaprio
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|You just have to love this girl.  She just wants to have all the stuff, without putting in the time to accumulate it. While she's obviously very immature, she gets it right by the end of the book, painfully growing up just like everyone has to.      If you've ever bought something you couldn't afford and regretted it later, you can identify with Sophie, and she'll make you laugh throughout the book.

1594201927|5.0|Most economists seem to have little or no historical sense of the economy going back more than a few decades.  U.S. economists just as often seem to think that the experiences of other countries, such as Argentina, are almost irrelevant.  Policy suffers as a result.  Ferguson's book is great for providing a broader perspective. I especially enjoyed the discussion of the downside of globalization, as seen from the perspective of 1914 and the tremendous disruption of trade resulting from the war.<br /><br />The Afterword is worth the price of the book all by itself.  Ferguson warns that money's ascent has never been smooth.  Human beings tend to assume that the present is a better guide to our economic future than a candid examination of past experience shows it has been up to now.  Humans easily fall into the same cognitive traps, over and over again over the centuries. It is entirely possible that we are living right now through the deflation of a multi-decade 'super bubble.'  I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />The book does have some problems.  Ferguson says too little on the central role of fossil fuels in the expansion of the economy over the past couple of hundred years. When the fossil fuels run out, will this expansion come to end, or even deflate?  Ferguson's own analysis confirms the numerous uncertainties in predicting our economic future. I therefore thought it was very strange that Ferguson criticized China for its one-child policy. Limiting population size to a sustainable level strikes me as the best way of preventing a global boom-and-bust scenario.<br /><br />Overall, though, the book is well worth reading.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|A vivid, Blu-ray rendering of a movie classic.  Tom Cruise's best and still defining role.
B001RFIGQ2|5.0|The album is fantastic. The selection of songs are a perfect match for Demi's voice. And believe me you do not want to miss out on the DVD. Miss Lovato's stage presence is amazing. And in the behind the scenes video she makes you feel like you are the only one she is talking to! I copied the music to my computer and transformed the tracks into MP3s. transferred them to a portable disk drive. Every nuance of every note she sings and every note played was flawlessly captured! And believe me you cannot beat the price on Amazon. Highly recommended!
B000HIVQLW|5.0|When I purchasd this compilation it said 2006--NOT 2001. As a collector of Pink Floyd since \\"Ummagumma\\" came out, I heard their music alter over the decades. My favorite songs are from the beginning to \\"Meddle\\", with the middle period audibly sounding heavier. Their last several albums fail to impress me, yet they did an excellant job with the DVD concert.<br /><br />This is a good Pink Floyd set people! Not only in selection but listening order and sound quality. All the music appeals to me and nothing lacks taste. If I had the choice of taking one PF set with me to Timbuktu it would be this.  Overall it represents \\"the best of Pink Floyd\\".
0375842209|5.0|I was a little confused at first by the voice of the author and was almost disturbed when I realized it was written from the voice of Death. However, I continued to read and found that this Death had a voice that was not negative or morose, simply factual and almost friendly. Amazing use of words to paint a picture of life in Germany during World War II about the surroundings and actions of a young orphan girl. Superb book! Highly recommend it.
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority Report, I would say, is one of the best science fiction films to be released over the past twenty-five years, and that is certainly no small feat given some of the competing films released over that time-span.  Minority Report obviously had a lot of effort put into it by both the filmmakers and its actors and the result is a brilliant thriller.  In the past decade I would call it Spielberg's best, ranking among his other great thrillers, `Raiders of the Lost Ark', and `Jaws'.<br /><br />The movies is based on a short story by the late sci-fi master Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, A Scanner Darkly) and it ranks up with Blade Runner as the greatest adaptations of his work.  John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the Chief of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia.  What exactly is his job?  To use the unusual psychic abilities of three beings - known as \\"Pre-Cogs\\"- it is his job to analyze future crime scenes and prevent murder from happening.  For ten years this system works without a flaw and they are close to taking the program national, only there's one problem...John's name has been called for the future-murder of Leo Crow -a man he has never once before met.  On the run Anderton must evade the highly controlled security of the future United States capital all while trying to prove his innocence, and in so doing unraveling the secrets of the system- secrets that would destroy everything the organization has worked so hard to achieve.<br /><br />What really makes this movie stand out is not the visual effects (though, they certainly are amazing), but it is the human aspect of this film that makes it a memorable experience for the audience.  The film manages to cater to all human emotions contained within the plot, from the fear of loss, obsession, greed, fear, insecurity, and many more.  All the characters are found to be believable, as none of them come across as being cardboard, as so many other action films do.<br /><br />Tom Cruise pulls a very believable performance and I consider this one of the best of his \\"Average Joe\\" performances.  By this I mean like in `War of the Worlds' he doesn't come across as being a superhero, as he was in the `Mission Impossible' franchise.  He is perfectly believable as a sad soul who only wishes to make up for his past mistakes and punish the criminals of the world.  Haunted by tragedy of the past we can't help but symphonize for his loss, because we can believe him.  This isn't a straight-forward \\"tragic\\" character, such as Kurt Russell's Colonel O'Neil in `Stargate' (1994).  John Anderton is suffering, but he hides it well, going on with his job.  In fact his loss is his drive in his work, so naturally he can't believe it when the system turns against him.  It's the compelling characters and performances from the actors that make the difference between a good movie and a great movie.  Special effects have nothing to do with the quality of the human element of the story (sorry, Michael Bay).<br /><br />The special effects of this film are amazing, providing a believable, yet still fascinating view of the future.  Unlike visions presented in Blade Runner, and to a certain degree Total Recall, this is a very clean, well kept design for the future.  All the buildings shine and all vehicles appear to be in tip-top condition, but like those other Dick based films the underlying structure of society is as corrupt as ever.  How the effect crew for this film was skipped over by the Academy I will never understand, because even two years after I first saw the film many of the visuals remain stuck in my mind.<br /><br />You should not miss Minority Report, because in my opinion it is one of the best films ever made, let alone one of the best science fiction films ever made.  For a thrilling, emotional, and mentally stimulating movie experience I can't recommend Minority Report strongly enough to give the film credit, for it goes above and beyond what so many other films have done.  So, if you want excitement and brain stimulating ideas forget the garbage of the current theater's films, such as \\"Transformers,\\" and do yourself a favor: forget that an action movie is not supposed to be dominated by pure special effects and action, go out, buy a copy of Minority Report, put it in your DVD player, sit down, and enjoy a non-stop thrill ride of a movie.ment and brain stimulating ideas forget the garbage of the current theater's films, such as \\"Transformers,\\" and do yourself a favor: forget that an action movie is not supposed to be dominated by pure special effects and action, go out, buy a copy of Minority Report, put it in your DVD player, sit down, and enjoy a non-stop thrill ride of a movie.

B000059XUP|1.0|As a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and the general practice of mocking bad films I can honestly say that there was no redeeming value in `The Crow: City of Angels.'  The film is just downright sloppy, and very unnecessary given the plot of the first film and how it didn't warrant a sequel in ANY way, but you know Hollywood: if one film makes a profit they need to try and repeat that film's formula and cash in again.<br /><br />This movie was a low-budget film, roughly $18 million in total cost, which doesn't say anything about the quality, because Alex Proyas, with a simple $15 million managed to make the first film- one of the most visually captivating comic-based films of all time.  But what the disadvantage this film does have is that director Tim Pope has nowhere near the talent of Proyas.  In fact, 95% of this film's visual style is a carbon copy of the original film, only now most of the city is lit by bright, YELLOW lights, and it happens to be situated beside the ocean.  Other than this the style of this film is a rip-off and being a rip-off fails to captivate the mind of the audience in the same way as the first film.<br /><br />Not to rip on Vincent Perez, but his performance as the new Crow was downright despicable- a pale, heartless imitation of Brandon Lee's critically acclaimed character in the first film.  This is probably more the fault of the director and scriptwriters, but regardless, this comes across more as a perversion of Brandon Lee than of a new character picking up the mantle of the Gothic anti-hero.<br /><br />The script is one of the cheesiest you'll ever see.  There is literally a point where the villain kills and drinks the blood of the crow and then gets the strength of the Crow.  This makes absolutely no sense and in no way reflects ANY of the mythos in either the first film or the comic series.<br /><br />The Crow is just too simple of a story to be made into an effective franchise because the formula runs like so: guy and loved one are brutally murdered, guy kills dudes who murdered him and said loved one, leaving a crow emblem at the crime scene, then when he's done he dies and joins loved one in afterlife.  This is all The Crow is.  It was good for one movie, but it just cannot be turned into a franchise.<br /><br />Keep in mind, I was half asleep when this movie was on TV, and even then -the time of day when I'm most acceptable of bad movies- I still managed to hate this movie with a passion, and not because I was a fan of the original, or because I had read bad buzz surrounding the movie (I hadn't even HEARD of it before that fateful night- and for good reason!) , but because I honestly, and truly could not stand ANY aspect of this film.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first film and the James O'Barr comic book, don't do as I did: do the smart thing.  Avoid `The Crow: City of Angels' with every ounce of your being.red, guy kills dudes who murdered him and said loved one, leaving a crow emblem at the crime scene, then when he's done he dies and joins loved one in afterlife.

B0000C7PQK|1.0|this CD of the Voyageur it's just not as good as the other ones. Won't had bought it if I knew it was not as good.
0792151712|5.0|As so many others have said, this is two movies in one.  The first sets the stage for the tragedy, but is flawed by an often too cheesy romance.  The second is the story of the foundering of the ship and the horror of the way in which passengers met their death.    Like many viewers, I think the Rose/Jack romance dialogue is weak (at times cringingly so), as well as their chase and escapes from both man and water which were overdone. I was amused in the theater when most others were watching with bated breath their many, many, many confrontations with the water coming into the ship.  It's as though James Cameron thought of every possible situation to escalate drama and used them all in exhausting succession instead of judiciously choosing and timing the most effective.    The story of the ship, the sinking and often accurate portrayal of the historic people involved with the ship, as well as the caliber of the acting, make the film outstanding.  The Rose story serves to paint mostly historic portraits well, and I love the older Rose in the framing scenes. Also outstanding are the special effects that make me feel as though I was there observing.    The trick I've used to make the movie a five rating is to watch it all through first, then re-watch with the fast forward button in hand.  I only need to see Brock Lovett's disappointing diamond search, Jack's poker game, his too long \\"I'm the king of the world\\" scene, the spitting scene, the boiler rooms, and many of Jack and Rose's on board water escapes once. By fast-forwarding through these and a few other parts, I'm able to focus on the majesty of the ship, the sometimes-accurate (but willing suspension of disbelief believable) historic persons, and the tragedy; I'm enthralled with my second edited viewing.    The teary part of the film to me are the photographs next to the bed of the old Rose's post Titanic adventures and freedom. It's there that I feel the strength of the romance.  Rose's memory of Jack and his encouragement to her to live life to the fullest that she that she honors and embraces make the sometimes goofy shipboard romance, in hindsight, beautiful.

0321344758|5.0|This book by Steve Krug was recommended to me by a developer friend, and it was worth every penny. Krug manages to condense into a short and readable format all of the key points about usability and website design. It's not an in-depth treatment, as he readily admits, and he does direct the reader to other resources for greater detail. But what he does provide is golden. There's not a wasted page. As in introduction and guide to website design, it's a gem. This book is proving invaluable as I redesign my own business website and it should be on the shelf of every business person who is planning a website.

B0015DYIH2|2.0|Don't get me wrong-I loved the Twilight saga and probably always will. Its the romantic, vampiristic companion to the Harry Potter series-but written with many more errors. As I read this book, I found many glaring plot holes.  As a vampire, you thirst for blood. So suppose that Bella is turned into a vampire. This creates the everlasting \\"thirst\\" for human blood that is irresistable. If she smells human, it makes her thirst take over.  Yet, just a few short weeks after she is turned into a vampire, she can go out unbothered? Though Charlie does come to see her, that cannot teach her to resist human blood in the way that Jasper hasn't been able to do in, like, 150 years.  She goes to see J. Jenks. She sees his assistant, all those in the waiting room, and they also go to a crowded resteraunt.  All in all, I enjoyed the plot of this book, but it is utterly horridly written. Sorry, Stephenie.

It is not a huge time investment, but is an efficient, fast way to get started and change your body.     The concept is simple, circuit training including three min of strength training (combines small and large muscle groups), two min of cardio (running in place, jumping jacks, punches), and one min of abs (all completed on a mat). This sequence is repeated three times... then you are done!!    There are essentially three workouts on this DVD; level one, level two, and level three. The video states, when you are comfortable with level one... move to level two and so on.     hope this review helps!
006135323X|4.0|Dan Ariely's \\"Predictably Irrational\\" is, in the end, a very quick and entertaining read. My only criticism lies in the book's numerous assertions, many of which seemed based on less-than-scientific experiments. As a college student who attends weekly behaviorial experiments (for 10 dollars a session), I know from personal experience that the surveys and questionairres involved are not always taken with 100 percent seriousness.     Ariely makes broad statements regarding human nature, rarely taking the time to discuss people who do not fit the mold, instead wanting to place all humans in large baskets or lovers-of-FREE! and over-the-top-comparers.     Still, the book is both educational and captivating. Easy to read in a couple of days, the separation by chapter leads to an enjoyable reading experience. Recommended for readers of all backgrounds!

B001ED7C58|5.0|I am a big fan of the book series and can't wait for the second movie to air in November 09. I decided to purchase the soundtrack for the movie because I got tired of downloading pieces of it and then it turned out to be poor quality. It came pretty quickly and I am totally happy now. All the artists on the soundtrack kind of mesh together. Very relaxing soundtrack. Bella's Lullaby is my favourite!
B001TOD92C|5.0|A Simon and Garfunkel song of the 1960s called \\"The Boxer\\" tells the story of a washed-up fighter who responds to his life with determination and fortitude. After the singer recounts the humiliations he has faced in and outside of the boxing ring, the song concludes: \\"I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains./ I am leaving but the fighter still remains.\\"<br /><br />This movie and DVD, \\"The Wrestler\\" has much of the grittiness of the Simon and Garfunkel song as it tells of a character who must follow his chosen path at all costs. Among other things, the movie also reminded me of the tough, shabby yet intense world of the underground writer Charles Bukowski. In the 1980s, Mickey Rourke, who has the lead role in this movie played Bukowski's alter ego Henry Chinanski in an adaptation of Bukowski's short story \\"Barfly\\".<br /><br />Most of the time, people need to stay within themselves to give their lives meaning. This seems to me to be the theme of \\"The Wrestler.\\" Mickey Rourke, who has just won a Golden Globe award for his performance, plays an aging pro wrestler, Randy \\"The Ram Robinson\\". The Ram had fought a battle with a wrestler named The Ayatollah in the 1980s, but 20 years later is reduced to cheap matches in small arenas. The Ram lives alone in a trailer park near Elizabethtown, New Jersey. After a particularly violent match, the Ram suffers a heart attack. His doctor tells him not to fight again. The Ram attempts to find meaning in his life apart from wrestling in a romantic involvement with an aging stripper, Cassidy (Maria Tormei), in making amends with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) and in taking a day job at a deli meat counter. Believing himself a failure in each of these three respects, The Ram returns to the life he knows: that of a pro wrestler in a rematch with the Ayatollah, even though he is aware that it could cost him his life.<br /><br />The movie has realistically effective scenes of the life of pro wrestlers, of their cameraderie and of the pain they endure even during staged matches, and of their fans. The scenes of the wrestling world are matched by the scenes in the strip club, with Cassidy in both her toughness and her vulnerability. The Ram is shown living alone in his shabby trailer, continuing his training, showing a substantial degree of introspection, and trying futily to make amends to his daughter. The characters and their environs are portrayed effectively, and both Rourke and Tomei give convincing performances.<br /><br />In addition to the Simon and Garfunkel song and to Bukowski, there are parallels to this movie in \\"Raging Bull\\" in \\"Rocky\\" and in other movies. The plot may be simple but it remains effective. The acting, the realistic atmosphere, and the quest by the two main characters to find meaning in life in harsh circumstances make this DVD memorable.<br /><br />Robin Friedmane and of the pain they endure even during staged matches, and of their fans.

0894803123|3.0|This has all the expected recipes in it, and is fun to read.  However, you may have a problem with the ice cream forming ice crystals, since all of the recipes use raw eggs in their base, (problematic in itself) rather than the usual cooked custard.  I made several of the ice creams, and the only that that was smooth and creamy was the NYSF--and my fiancee said he couldn't tell it from the real thing.<br /><br />I had the same ice crystal problems with the sorbets--I tried adding more sugar, less sugar, alcohol.  Nothing worked until I learned you needed to cook a simple syrup--equal parts water/fruit--rather than just mixing the sugar with the fruit, as the book has you do.
B000002513|5.0|After the promising but uneven \\"Greetings From Asbury Park,\\" Bruce Springsteen's second album, \\"The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle,\\" cemented his future's as one of rock music's timeless poets. Already on only his second album, Springsteen has perfected many of the signature trademarks and central themes of his writing style, creating broad epics combined with memorable vignettes of colorful characters whose tales still strike a chord with Boss fans today, from the boardwalk dwellers of \\"4th of July, Asbury Park\\" to the horny rabblerousers of \\"Rosalita\\" to the doomed lovers of \\"Incident On 57th Street\\" (a song whose live performances top its somewhat misguided studio take). While the sound of the record is quite uneven due to the fact that the definitive lineup had not fallen into place - Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg would not join until the next album - it's still a fun slice of early Springsteen that's integral to tracing his evolution as an artist. It's not as cohesive as \\"Born to Run\\" or as deep in meter as \\"Nebraska,\\" but it's a very, very good effort.

Next thing I know, I got my money back, stating that it was out of stock.  This was for a birthday present for my son, and I was disappointed that the listing and confirmation led me to believe I would get it.  At least I got my money back OK.  It would be be more beneficial if the listing might have said \\"could be in stock or not\\" and then I would be the one taking my chances.  Thanks.
B000O176Q6|5.0|This is one of the single movies (besides the original SW trilogy) that I've owned in most possible formats - VHS, Beta, LD, DVD, and now Blu-Ray.  This one seems better to me.  I'm not sure why besides just the picture quality, but there are parts that seemed new to me.    I haven't done any kind of in depth research as to why and I don't care to.  I'm just saying that it seemed different and longer to me.  Much Better!  I've loved this film since I was a little kidlet and it almost felt like seeing a brand new version of it.    I can't wait until they release it in hologram or direct-to-brain (DTB) format because I'll buy those too!  This is just one of those films that always tears it up for me and this Blu edition is absolutely fantastic.

0525951113|4.0|(Before we get to the plot, we here @ The Rotten Review decided a bit of background was needed)<br />Daemon is the term given to programs that run in the background - we know that they're there and that react automatically to certain events.  Daemons are tolerated even though they operate beyond the direct control of human beings because they have no will of their own - only triggers cam make them stop and go.<br /><br />Daniel Suarez's brilliant thriller inverts that description  - he creates a story based on a Daemon that seems to have its own will.  It's a program that slowly but surely begins to extend its tendrils beyond cyberspace, turning human beings into computer peripherals.  At least, that's the premise.  \\"Daemon\\" the story begins as many thrillers do - with a murder.  Detective Sebeck becomes the latest in a long line of local fictitious police officers to be embroiled in something bigger than himself once he begins a routine homicide.  A string of otherwise unconnected events begin to lead to the deaths of computer experts connected with a now dead computer programmer, Matthew Sobol.  The creator of hugely successful on-line games, Sobol seems to have made a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, one he appears to be putting to use serving a sinister agenda.  Unlike pre-internet games, in which the interface was typically between man and AI, Sobol developed games for an era that cut its teeth on huge MMORPGs - epic tournaments played over the internet in which AI manipulated large numbers of human players as enemies and allies.  As Sebeck draws connections between seemingly unconnected events, seemingly unconnected people find their fates tied in the growing menace of Sobol's Daemon.  Media personalities, law enforcement, programmers and cyber-criminals - all find themselves receiving offers-they-dare-not-refuse, apparently from the program.  Law enforcement quickly dismiss Daemon as a hoax, even as higher ups (men known only by the acronyms of their agencies) realize that they are facing an enemy that has seized the initiative and can make them fight on its terms.<br /><br />WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?<br />In many ways, \\"Daemon\\" reminds you that you are reading a typical thriller - the characters aren't compelling, the dialog is mostly expository, the prose largely artless, there's a lot of tech-speak that often comes off as condescending, the finale is likely to disappoint and the novel spends so much time going places without ever reaching a destination - you begin to wonder if there is one.<br /><br />WHY YOU MUST READ IT<br />At first glance, \\"Daemon\\" seems no different than many techno thrillers - using a computer app as an exotic vehicle upon which to build your typical fill-in-you-favorite-author's story of greed and geek-lust.  Instead of cloned dinosaurs, wanton androids, suppressed ancient secrets and other subjects based-on-an-actual-Wikipedia-article - we have Matthew Sobol's distributed AI.  In those other stories, the \\"device\\" is a convenient way have good fight evile, which normally boils down to separating the knowledgeable and honest from hucksters and idiots.  With only the barest hints that that the authors of such novels have conducted any meaningful study of their subject (despite piles of accolades haling \\"meticulous research\\") these other stories never go beyond the premise, that is, they never get past their devices.  A story based on an ancient manuscript detailing a secret history long suppressed by the powers that be is in fact a story of an ancient history and the threat it poses for the powers that be.  The strength of such stories is no greater than the author's grasp of the underlying subject which is typically (and obviously) slim, encompassing no more than needed to fill about 300 pages of single spaced, 12 pt. print.<br /><br />This is not the case with \\"Daemon\\".  Brilliantly, Suarez keeps a tight lip on his subject - not allowing us to know whether the daemon is real, whether the required technology even exists (most authors gleefully give up that ghost within the first 50 pages).  Just when the story begins to get a grip on the nature of its cybernetic antagonist, Suarez shifts gears and makes his enemy more amorphous - allowing its \\"shape\\" to vary based on whoever is analyzing it.  Daemon becomes a national security threat when viewed by the government, an economic problem when revealed to the heads of companies it appears to have infected, a technological riddle when studied by cyber-security experts and a more social-studies issue when examined by anybody else.  The beauty is that none of these different perspectives is that far off the bat - The Daemon co-opts humans into its plans, and the shape of the threat varies as much as human nature does.  (Much like its enemies, Daemon's human collaborators have their own ideas of what their new paradigm means.)  As a practical result, Suarez's Daemon remains shapeless even as it stays compelling.  because we don't know what Daemon precisely is, we  don't have to constantly ask themselves the same questions that hobble similar books - is this possible?  Am I being skeptical about something that can happen?  Am I just too stupid to debunk this story, and too lame to admit it?  \\"Daemon\\" rises over other research-based thrillers because it rises past the need to be researched.  The technology isn't really at issue.<br /><br />Suarez keeps things humming by keeping his \\"scenes\\" mercifully short.  Events seldom have enough breathing time to trigger the reader's own \\"suspension of belief\\" daemon, and Suarez proves himself adept with some great action scenes.  \\"Daemon\\" is easily the kind of novel that the world wanted about 10 years ago, when the internet was new, and any mention of its name conjured up images of a sinister and unknown cybernetic universe, rather than an overheated domain of bloggers, twitters and slavish celebrity hounds.  Nevertheless, Suarez breathes some much needed life into the fear of the internet, finally giving the world wide web its very own Black Widow.gleefully give up that ghost within the first 50 pages).

1932907009|3.0|Blake Snyder provides a comprehensive \\"Review\\" mechanism for your script, making you double-check every aspect of your screenplay that will get it SOLD in Hollywood. He compels you to look at your script from a buyer's point of view - be that your agent, producer, studio or whoever else can buy a movie-script. Excellent examples and ways to make YOU and your script more marketable are presented throughout the book. The book should be referenced each time you write a script to ensure you are not missing out any critical elements. Snyder's style of writing is witty and keeps you turning the page. A definite must-read for every screen-writer.    Why not 5 stars? The book's title itself is misleading \\"...The last book on screenwriting that you'll ever need\\". As a new writer, I expected the book to teach me HOW to write a screenplay, because that's what the title implied. Now I need to buy another book to learn the \\"technique\\" of screen-writing, and THEN read Blake Snyder to know how to review and market my script - the \\"business\\" of writing.
0756405890|5.0|First, let me say I can't believe its taken me so long to review this book!<br /><br />I never ever thought it would have happened... but it has... this one has officially dethroned my life-time favorite, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />It has gotten to the point now that if I am wanting a new book to read, I come here first, then look at the \\"similar\\" books, or the other books people who liked this book bought... doing this has since led me to other fantastic authors (George R.R. Martin to name one..) but still nothing is quite as gripping and soulful as The Name of the Wind.<br /><br />I, like many others... am very eager for the next book!
B00133KFGW|5.0|Great movie to keep passing on between friends. My dad has seen it multiple times and insists on still watching it again. It is a serious movie that I wouldn't call sad. Has a few sad moments but they become happy. Definately recommend this movie for old or young viewers.
1592289444|5.0|Apparently, there is great controversy over whose story this truly is, and whether it really happened or not.  The newest release says the story IS true and did happen, just not to Rawicz.  [...]<br /><br />The story is about a Polish man captured by Russians and sent to a labor camp for refusing to admit he was a spy, which he in fact was not.<br />Sent to a labor camp in Siberia, he plans an impossible escape to India with six other men.  Their journey would embark on many amazing situations with joy, sorrow, and friendship.<br />I could not put this book down and have never had a story move me to complete tears!  The story as a whole was so moving, that I felt it wrong to pick up another book for at least a week.  It wouldn't have done the story justice!<br />I recommend that everyone read this moving story!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Michael Buble's first two albums were great. \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" is nothing short of fabulous! Buble's voice is very clear, pleasant, and expresses the emotion in each song beautifully. Also, the arrangement of each song melds extremely well with Buble's style of singing. Finally, most of the song on this album were sung at least by one other person so you may very well already have many of the songs in your library. Nonetheless, you definitely want this album because, the arrangement of each song is so different and superior to the way anyone else has showcased these songs. All in all, this is one of my favorite albums.
1932100660|5.0|This book has the data driven evidence of how important a whole foods plant based diet is for health. The evidence is clearly laid out that the solution to our health crisis in America is at the ends of our forks! I would hope that every Congressperson discussing our health care \\"crisis\\" would read and absorb the content of this book. It would upset out society's norms to change our habits of eating, but it would save our lives and our economy.
1400063515|4.0|An interesting, mostly logical and thought provoking book. The author makes some serious observations but keeps a droll and very readable touch. However, as with any title that addresses philosophies, it requires (at least of me) that, if you've lost concentration, you go back over the section to make sure you've got it \\"right.\\" But all in all a good read.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Thank goodness I know STAR TREK, and the order of the episodes.  The order of the episodes is way off per season.  I had to go back and forth, from disk to disk to see the episodes in order, what a pain in the @##!  The quality of video and sound is excellent.  The special features are a must see, and you should watch them all!  A very good buy at an excellent price, for what you get.
0446402397|5.0|A serial killer loose in 50's Soviet Union?  Impossible, crime is a result of rampant capitalism and negligible in such a \\"perfect\\" communist world.  This is the situation a government agent finds himself in when he embarks on learning the truth and tracking down this killer in this great book.  The book creates a balancing act; vividly portraying the stark realities of life and the uplifting spirit of its people.  AND to top it all off, a fast paced, richly plotted thriller with a great ending.  Don't miss this read!
1423101472|5.0|I am so sad to see the end of this series come. Now, I knew that it would and I'd rather that the series come to a satisfying ending than continue forever and become laced with filler. It seems like it took me forever to get my hands on this book considering that it came out in May and that I didn't get it until July! It was worth the wait though...completely worth the wait.    In the final installment of the series, Percy Jackson and the other demigods of Camp Half-Blood prepare for the final battle against Kronos for Olympus (not to mention the Empire State Building and New York City). That's pretty much this book in a nutshell...prepping for the battle, fighting the final battle and all of the little twists and turns that happen along the way. It seem simple, but it works. Every page of this book moves flawlessly -it's one of those rare times when the dialogue, action, characters and plot are all working harmoniously together to create the perfect storm...or the perfectly entertaining novel.    While this book isn't deep or heavy literature by any means, it's incredibly fun, fast-paced and filled with action and the usual twists and turns associated with the series. I found myself constantly flipping pages and reading late into the night to see what was going to happen next. Riordian does a phenomenal job of portraying action scenes without making them confusing or awkward. The transitions are perfect, the characters are fun and the story doesn't get bogged down with ridiculous plot or overbearing world mechanics.    I wouldn't say that this is a \\"perfect\\" book -but writers and readers of both YA and adult literature should take note -Riordan knows how to do things right. Even though I'm older than the target audience of this series, I absolutely love it. It has a way of appealing to the kid in me while still having enough to it to keep the adult part of me interested.    The ending is surprisingly good, though maybe a little too perfect for some. But thankfully,it is heavily implied that this is only the end of the first story arc in a \\"Camp Half-Blood series,\\" implying that there will be follow-up novels set in the world of Percy Jackson. Due to the nature of the world itself, this is a perfectly plausible idea and could bring about even more great stories.    In a YA/Juvenile universe that is becoming flooded with vampire/paranormal/fantasy books, primarily for girls, this series breaths some freshness into the genre and offers something for all readers. Best Percy Jackson of the series and, so far, the best YA book I've read all year.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite is one of those movies you either get or you don't.     Some people will laugh because they think the characters are pathetic and stupid and, well...it's fun to laugh at people so we can feel better about ourselves, isn't it? For people like that, it is probably important to pay attention to Don, the \\"cool\\" guy at Preston High who laughs incredulously at Napoleon and his friends...but who is also unaware that he's the most pathetic character in the film.    Anyway, I think the genius of this movie is partly in its deadly accurate portrayal of small-town American life for teenagers. I grew up in rural Maine (another potato farming state) and I identified very strongly with many of the seemingly absurd situations in the movie...the wacky characters are not so wacky, really. The way some shots are set up say so much about what a struggle it can be to fit in in a place where the both minds and cliques are pretty closed.    Most of the movie's charm is in its examination of the power of true friendship. Anyone who doesn't think there is a deeper meaning to this somewhat pointless, plotless, random collection of bizarre situations doesn't understand what it means to be willing to do anything for people you care about.    In the end, this is a highly original movie(with a very good soundtrack)that will be enjoyed by the Dons of the world who like to laugh at the geeks (unfortunately) and enjoyed more by those who can see pieces of their own humanity in Napoleon and his family and friends.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|My grandmother loves period pieces, and this is one of her favorites. It is very well done.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I REALLY enjoy this movie. In some ways I prefer it over Matrix. Equilibrium is a combination for Fahrenheit 451 and 1984. The world it creates is stark and \\"peaceful,\\" at the expense of emotion and art.    The acting is well done, the action sequences are mesmerizing (the last fight scene between Bale and the main protagonist is one of the coolest [and never-before-done] gun fight scenes), and the plot is fascinating.    Some people seem to think it is a rip-off of Matrix. I highly disagree. It stands on its own. I definitely recommend that you watch this movie.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|These should have come on the controllers in the first place. They definitely aid in the grip of the controller. If you have problems installing them, your doing it wrong. Read the instructions. They snap on and don't come off.
B0000549B0|5.0|This movie is a classic.  Jimmy Stewart IS Elwood P. Dowd, the dialogue is subtle yet quick.  It is funny, clever and touching.  If this movie doesn't make you laugh and feel better about whatever is going on in your life, then you are too serious.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|A long time ago I saw this movie. It intrigued me because of the sword play. Each fight scene had to be carefully worked out because they are using the real swords and not Hollywood version ones. Also to top this off, the El Cid is based on a real man and his life.

B000ROALE4|4.0|After taking a long while off from slayer, i bought christ illusion after listening to the song \\"final six.\\" I was blown away by the opening track flesh storm, and the ride continued to get better as i got through the album. Slayer still has got it, and in my opinion they are still far superior to any new metal band that is out there. I am happy that slayer are still around, still doin what they do, and they don't pretend to be something they are not. They are always the same, and don't conform to trends. There is alot to be said for that. Some of my favorites from the album, Flesh Storm, Skeleton Christ, Jihad, Black Serenade, and Final Six. The whole album is solid though, flows from front to back. Anybody who was once into slayer needs to buy this album, it just might get you back into them!!!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Very captivating show. I have watched the first 2 seasons and am completely hooked. I never thought I would like a movie about a serial killer, but I do.
031606792X|5.0|*One or two spoilers alert*I read \\"Breaking Dawn\\" twice.  I am also re-reading the series again.  I absolutely loved Jacob's version--the titles of his chapters were hilarious! That part I re-read 3 times.  His take on the situation had me laughing, crying, and just overall emotional.  When I first heard of this book series, through a friend of mine's son, I thought \\"how boring that must be.\\"  I much prefer non-fiction books, mostly on history, autobiographies, and political books.  When the \\"Twilight\\" movie previews came on during some of my TV shows, I thought to myself \\"how dumb\\" and I would NEVER go see that movie or rent it on DVD.<br />It's when my 59-year old sister was talking about it one day and how much she loved the movie that I became curious.  So one night in April 2009, my son, his fiance, my husband, and I rented the movie.  I fell in love with the characters and the storyline.  Even my husband, who only watches the History channel and anything on airplanes and motorcycles, enjoyed the movie.  That's when I borrowed the Twilight book and started reading through the series.  I got through all 4 pretty fast since I couldn't put them down!  I want to mention I work full-time, am a mother of 2 grown kids and a grandmother of one.  I am one who loved the happy ending.  I have no trouble with Jacob's imprinting or the baby's name.  The romance part took me back to those feelings I had in high school for my first love.  It was easy to get lost in Edward, Bella, and Jacob's lives.<br />It's \\"to each his own\\" so just because I loved it doesn't mean someone else will.  But I recommend you give this a chance!

0142410314|5.0|I bought this book to read to my 6.5 year old son and he loved it.  He would ask all the time for it to be read to him, which made me so happy.  I really want to get him to love books as reading is such an important skill for school.  I was a bit concerned that it may be too long of a book for him at his age, but he fared well and even read a paragraph or two each time we sat down to read it.  Thank goodness there are some pictures peppered throughout the book to keep his interest sharp.  Entertaining story with lessons to learn too - What more can you ask for in a children's book.
B00009MGGI|5.0|When the House of Cards Trilogy was first shown on PBS, I was hooked and would not miss a single episode.  Sir Ian Richardson is at his most sly and wicked, cynical and mesmerizing.  The role of a lifetime, surrounded by a perfect cast. Absolutely brilliant and enthralling. If you want to see pure perfection in story, performance and cast, you should not miss this one.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm sure that by the end of my 30 days I'll be shredded. In one respect, I'm already seeing the results in my first week. Jillian pushes me hard but positively. My only warning is that you warm up a bit more that Jillian does. I felt so much better doing the workouts when I had spent my own time stretching as the dvd started up. Overall, a great buy, though.
B0020MKTOS|4.0|Amusing to see Clint as such an overt grouch, he is usually  more subtle.  Rest of cast excellent, loved grandma!  The film's  main weakness is his ease of transition from racist hate to   adopting this charming family.  Overall, Clint delivers as usual.  Got this for my dad, who by the way, shares a lot of Clint's  characteristics, and just happens to be a huge Clint fan. . .
0440238609|5.0|I was kept constantly interested just to see how the author's mind worked as he moved from enigma to conundrum!  The idea of a continuous cycle of universes is not a new one, but his approach to it -- and how one would move from one to the other -- is totally unique.  If the move-makers go on to complete the trilogy I can see a real heyday for the special effects people!
B000024D4R|5.0|Anybody who wants to be in a rock band, should listen to this album.  This is rock at it's best.  Well crafted, well executed, just an amazing album.  Yes, it might not be Floyd's most accesible material, but it is rewarding.  If you liked Dark Side, you might not like this, but it has the same writing quality and music genius to it.  Obviously, I like this album.
0440237688|5.0|This book is one I read before a few years ago and wanted to buy it to read again. It's easy and quick reader but so enjoyable to read. I would recomend you to read this book.

B000148KK2|1.0|remember when Joe Piscipo imitated Sinatra & everything sounded the same ?  he could do the same with her. She's attractive, great at the piano, should hire a vocalist. I've  never heard her cover an octave. To be fair I did give up listening to her.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I was introduced to showtime when I first started watching californication, that show is really good. I didn't think any other show could be as good as californication. So then one day the first episode of dexter was on. I started watching it thinking that it would be hard for a show about a serial killer to be interesting since it had been done so many times in movies. But as the show started the acting seemed so good and the series was just brilliant. The only downside to it is that each season is only 12 episodes long. But in 12 episodes it manages to do what most shows don't achieve in years. Season 3 is a very good season. Im thinking season 4 is going to be the best one though, because there's going to be a new serial killer and Lundy is coming back.
0143034901|1.0|This book promises way more than it delivers.  You think it's going to be complex and intricate, but it's not. The plot fizzles out and you can easily guess what's going to happen.  This could have been written as a high school literary project -- it's so derivative and unoriginal!  My suggestion: use a little brain power and read The Name of the Rose and save this for when you are feeling really mindless or just coming out of general anaesthetic.
B0025X4OYI|4.0|Heard a lot about this classic collection on NPR and its new re-release as a double CD.  Being a Ray Charles fan for many years I guess I`m still stuck with Georgia ON MY Mind.  I love Country and Western in general but maybe I was expecting too much from this Collection.  It was OK, but more of a Cross-Over then real Country for me.  I now remember listening to some of these songs years ago on this CD but did`nt connect back then that was Ray, doing Country.  I`l listen to it a few more times...maybe it will grow on me.
B002CNV52A|2.0|It's not a horrible album, but there is nothing new here.   I used to be a rabid fan, but my enthusiasm has diminished over the years as the band continues to produce albums that offer no new ideas, hackneyed lyrics...blah, blah, blah.  This band has experienced zero evolution over the past 10 years.   I do find it kind of amusing to find them on the Billboard chart right next to the Jonas Bros and Eminem.  That will drop off sharply next week, as their discs usually do.      Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz............
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This movie will be the new way you demonstrate your new HD-TV theater system, filled with high resolution shoots and high clarity on the audio that makes u say \\"wow O_O\\". This version of Advent Children defiantly told a much better in-depth story than its predecessor,with extra small scenes where it simply explains the characters motives to longer fighting scenes that makes the action just way more intense.The ending of the movie was much better,& more brutal,than the simple \\"stabbing in the shoulder\\" from the last one. A+ movie :)
B001G1ACVY|5.0|Although you may never hear many of the songs on this album on the radio, it is fabulous in its entirety.  I have listened to it a million times and I never cease to be amazed.  Jason Mraz is an amazing artist.  Although I like all his albums, this one is really terrific.  If you ever get the chance to see him live, do not let it pass you by.  He gives the most memorable and fun shows.  He is one of the few artists that is even better live than on the radio.
B000ELJBAK|4.0|Great record for guitar music fans. David's best solo album, still. All \\"Pink Floyd\\" fans should have this record.
B00000AFDW|3.0|This disc was the original lineup back in action.<br />At this time kiss was once again one of the hottest bands in the world.<br />They were always big but in 1996-98 they were at the top and I remember even visiting a college in washington state and seeing students dressed up like them everywhere.  This disc had some great songs on it like \\"witbin\\" , 'psycho circus\\" , 'you wanted the best\\" and \\"into the void\\"  some of the rest of the songs were not as good and the band was trying to be anthemic and not too hard sounding. This is NOT a terrible disc though by any means. It sold well enough and was enjoyable. The band should have just kept releasing songs and writing like they are now.  Just making songs they love without trying to return to destroyer with weaker songs.  The German version of this has a great live cd with it that has an incredible live version of 'into the void\\" on it. The japanese version has a great ace song that should have been on the regular release and s weaker song taken off.  Anyways,  don't believe that this is a bad disc it's not as good as it could have been; but it's good hard rock.  It's not in \\"Revenge\\" s class or 'carnival of souls\\" but it was decent And should have been followed in 2000 by a new album in which everyone really let loose.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|This story line was a bit slow at times, but lived up to it's saga reputation as a classic bond/action movie.
B0024RID60|5.0|This slbum was a supersmash disc. With numerous hits and cool songs. The stones has released a number of great albums in the seventies. That had hits and were interesting but This one was more varied and genre crossing.  And it was a true monster seller. The band had recorded a whole other album but they never released it, instead they went back into the studio and came up with this gem.  It showed that they were still at the top of their game and able to create a disc that was able to blow away much of the competition. The only thing one could hope for is that lost album will someday be put out by virgin.  The Stones have been very stingy with unreleased and rare material and it's just a shame.
0312360266|5.0|I really liked this book. It hooked be from the very first page and hung to me until the end. I ran out and bought the next 3 books because I knew I would close one and open another right away.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is an intense drama that explores human nature under extreme duress and makes bones about it!!  You might not want to stop watching the whole series just to see what happens.  Forget the reality shows and get a load of this!  Not for the faint of heart!  Worth the money - I just wish there was more - and there is with the second season.
159562015X|1.0|I was extremely dissatisfied with this seller. I never received my product after nearly 3 to 4 weeks. I tried contacting the seller but never got a response back. I highly advise future consumers NOT to buy from this seller!
B001SMC91M|3.0|Here we go: I like it because it has attitude and it's loud. The Otis Redding meets Andre Williams vibe is workable and they work it hard. These guys probably kill live, and burn down bars wherever they play. It does rock. You could get drunk and howl to this music, easy.<br /><br />The reasons I can't love it? It's completely derivative. If you go through Andre Williams' back catalog, sad to say, but Andre did this all before. And so have others. It pretty much travels where R.L. Burnside, T-Model Ford, and a whole bunch of other Fat Possum artists have gone before. It's absolutely not original in any way, shape, or form.<br /><br />In some way, despite the energy put into it, the album comes off as worked up - even overwrought - rather than passionate. The playing is OK but not great, honestly. I live in New Orleans and we have better musicians than this playing in bars any night of the week; sorry, but it's true. These guys are all right, but nothing to write home about. The other reason I can't love this is Joe Lewis himself, who is honestly not that great a singer. Like the rest of the record, he's OK, but he ain't quite where he needs to be.<br /><br />Overall, this is respectable, but it's not inspired, and it's not great. I think it qualifies as a near-miss. It's close. But close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.
B001KTSKDY|3.0|Somehow I ended up getting a hardback book, which is OK but doesn't look so good with my complete Grisham collection.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Great DVD -- so sad that this great show got cancelled before it's time.  I hope that SciFi would consider picking this up.  I love Buffy and Joss Whedon; but Fox made BIG MISTAKE by cancelling this show, instead of Dollhouse.  Having both shows on Friday night made my day.  Now I will make sure to watch Ghost Whisperer and maybe tune in to Dollhouse.  Can't wait for the Season 2 DVD of Sarah Connor to come out.  I will miss this great show, RIP Terminator.
0439875889|5.0|This book has been a great hit with our daughter.  We bought it for her when she was less than a year old, and it continues to be a favorite at 16 months.<br /><br />I give credit to hearing about this book from the TV show \\"Medium\\", where the youngest daughter was reciting it.  That got me looking for a copy, and I'm so glad that I did.  The rhymes are fun, and our daughter is starting to recognize the names of the various animals shown.<br /><br />My only regret is that the author doesn't seem to have written any other children's books.  Why??
B000024ZYP|4.0|Rich and resonant in tone, Brahem's oud blends well on this recording with the soprano sax and bass clarinet of John Surman and the bass of Dave Holland. The music defies tidy description: it sounds rooted in an Arabic tradition, but yet sounds modern. It is remarkable to hear these three musicians interact with each other, and it is even more remarkable when you stop to consider that Surman and Holland have not grown up playing Arabic music. It is clear that all three are remarkable musicians, and it is clear that they really enjoyed recording with one another. Without percussion, the music needs an anchoring force, and Holland's bass performs that role, supplying a pulse that the music can spring forth from, but also supplying a melodic voice from time to time as the three musicians weave in and out of each others' lines.<br /><br />This is music that truly seems organic, music that truly seems to grow from musical seeds that all three musicians bring to their fruitful collaboration (\\"Thimar,\\" by the way, means \\"fruits\\"). Veteran ECM engineer Jan Erik Kongshaug works his usual practical magic in blending these three distinctive yet sympathetic sounds together into a pleasing and distinguished mix.
B000085RTX|2.0|I bought \\"Black Halo\\" at the prompting of my college-aged sons and loved it, so I went out and got Karma, Epica, and Fourth Legacy.  All are carbon copies of Black Halo (I don't know which was released first, I'm just going by when I got them).  Since I can't return opened media, I'll make money off them at a yard sale.  Really disappointed.  But Roy Khan has a KILLER voice.  LOVE to hear him sing, even if it is the same thing every time.  Get Black Halo if you want to try this band.  The first track on that CD is the best one of ALL their CD's.
B000007RYQ|4.0|This CD begins with the opening trumpet notes from the Mahler 5th Symphony, then plunges into a postmodern Klezmer-like jazz idiom that both infuriates and captivates. Wow! Talk about being hit over the head with Mahler! Whew!<br /><br /> All the music on this CD comes straight from Mahler, with jazz arrangements by pianist Uri Caine. Besides Caine, the musicians include Joey Baron (drums), Aaron Bensoussan (cantor and hand drums), Dave Binney (soprano saxophone), Danny Blume (guitar and electronics), Dean Bowman (vocals), Don Byron (clarinet), Dave Douglas (trumpet), Mark Feldman (violin), Michael Formanek (bass), Larry Gold (cello), Arto Lindsay (vocals), DJ Olive (turntables), and Josh Roseman (trombone). Yes, this lineup should be a signal that no, this is not Mengelberg's Mahler. Much of it is loud, vulgar, crazy--hey, doesn't that sound like the comments that many critics made of Mahler's music when it was first performed? These arrangements really do make Mahler sound shocking once again, providing a nice jolt for ears that have grown so accustomed to Mahler, Mahler everywhere. Yet, at times this recording brings out the profound beauty of Mahler, too, the aching lyricism and great depths of feeling that Mahler could convey so well.<br /><br />Some Mahlerians will hate this disk, others will embrace it, but none will fail to be moved by it. An utterly fascinating release.
0141439807|4.0|Mansfield Park seems to appear quite frequently on people's \\"least favourite Austen book\\" lists, but over the years I've come to think more and more highly of it. I've become very fond of timid, frail little Fanny, whose heart is a good deal warmer than those of the more flamboyant female characters. She's affectionate, loyal, and prepared to stick to what she feels to be right even though she suffers all the more for it because she's so powerless.<br /><br />But Fanny is not a beguiling heroine to hang a whole novel on, and Austen does not attempt to. Mansfield Park is a rich and complex work, with ambiguous characters, plots within plots, and layers of symbolism that aren't what I usually associate with Jane. Her use of the play \\"Lovers' Vows\\" is sheer brilliance in what it shows us of the characters and their entwined relationships, even down to the fate of the performance itself. On a smaller scale, the game of \\"Speculation\\" does something similar.<br /><br />Mary Crawford can be seen as a portrait of what Elizabeth Bennet might be if she had all the wit and liveliness we love, but without solid virtue at her core. Mrs Norris is, I think, Austen's nastiest female character (in the six novels, at least; I'm not counting Lady Susan). She makes Lady Catherine seem like a cuddly granny. Edmund is very silly for most of the book, but it's (mostly) convincing, and it's forgivable, because he gets there in the end. Henry Crawford plays the villain, but he had a very good chance of being the hero.<br /><br />The editor of my edition says he considers Mansfield Park \\"one of the most profound novels of the nineteenth century\\", which is high praise indeed. I'll content myself with saying I like it very much.
B000002ADT|5.0|This was at least the third and maybe the best reissue of a jazz classic, and it is priced fairly. Carefully remastered and featuring an extra cut not found on any of the previous releases, this version of Kind of Blue is a CD that belongs in every jazz lover's collection--and even if you don't think you like jazz, you ought to hear this CD. Great, great, music by any standard.
0762434279|1.0|The reason this book was so cheap is because the book is only two inches by two inches.  I don't recall the size of the book being anywhere on the product description.  Don't see the point of the book, they left out about half of the content.
B000002I4S|4.0|No, I was not a Coltrane fan in the `60s. Like many of my generation, I was led to Coltrane's music by rockers such as Jim (now Roger) McGuinn and Carlos Santana, who credited Coltrane as an influence on their music, and by Miles Davis--I started with Bitches Brew and eventually worked back to Kind of Blue, and gee whiz, there was that Coltrane guy again! Giant Steps, recorded in 1960, was Coltrane's first recording as a leader, and it is generally considered something of a jazz classic.<br /><br /> Comparing the MFSL CD to the regular Atlantic version, I found the differences subtle, consisting mainly of subtly cleaner trebles and a slightly better separation of the instruments with the MFSL version. If you already have the Atlantic version, I see no real need to replace it with the MFSL version, but if you do not own a copy of this landmark recording, the MFSL version is the one to get. (One little nit to pick: despite all of MFSL's careful and lavish attention to detail, they managed to misspell the name of original producer Nesuhi Ertegun, changing his first name to \\"Neshui.\\" Oops!)
B0009P42S2|4.0|This is a great movie.  My brother read it was 10 years in the making!! It was a great great movie. I love Howl's moving castle, prinvcess mononoke and spirted away laready. I think this one might have made the collection!
B00005LB50|3.0|Back in 1969 I used to wear a beat-up cloth jacket on which I had written in big, bright letters across the back, \\"Buffalo Sringfield Lives.\\" I bring that bit of trivia up not to provide another piece of evidence that I misspent my youth, but rather to establish that I really did have high hopes of being bowled over by this release. Alas, that was not to be.<br /><br /> Of the four disks in this set, only the final two merit any sort of repeat listening. The first two have their moments, but overall there is just too much demo material and filler that sounds awfully weak. Disk 3 is an interesting assortment of alternate cuts, demos, and hits, and the 4th disk contains remastered versions of the group's first two albums. Particularly enjoyable on Disk 3 are some early versions of tunes that Neil Young would later record on his solo album.<br /><br /> The booklet consists largely of old press clippings, and is somewhat disappointing in not providing a more in-depth history of the group.(And hey, whatever happened to Jim Messina? None of his music is included in the four disks.) All in all, there some interesting things to be found in this box, but when you get right down to it, the music of Buffalo Springfield sounds better when played back in the imagination than on a 21st-century stereo system.
B001RTCP1A|5.0|Item arrived on time and as promised. I would do business with this seller again.
B0018RWD6S|4.0|This recording, originally made in 1963, has become something of a legendary cult item over the years. It was the first time that Coltrane's classic quartet made a recording with a vocalist, and the results are, well, the stuff of legend. Hartman's rich voice and clear articulation are complemented perfectly by Coltrane's sax, McCoy Tyner's piano, Jimmy Garrison's bass, and Elvin Jones's drums. The songs are standards: \\"They Say It's Wonderful,\\" \\"Dedicated to You,\\" \\"My One and Only Love, \\" \\"Lush Life,\\" \\"You Are Too Beautiful,\\" and \\"Autumn Serenade.\\" They are all great performances, and engineer Rudy Van Gelder captured everything in clean, nuanced sound, which the MFSL remastering has presented in the best possible light. The only drawback to this release is its length--it clocks in at just over 31 minutes. But don't let that stop you from getting this recording, which contains 31 of the most beautiful minutes of jazz vocals ever recorded.
0767836324|5.0|This movie is a good Peter Pan movie to watch with your family.  It is geared towards children with an adult touch to keep even Mom and Dad interested.  I recommend it for families to watch together.
B001N26GFM|5.0|Not the movie, it is a beautiful work of gut-wrenching horror. I wept like a baby and I am a 62 year-old man. What is appalling to me is reading all of the one-star reviews. I now see how the holocaust (shoah) could have taken place, all that is necessary is for a nation to be composed of and ruled by people with no feelings, bereft of human compassion and sensitivity, just like several of the reviewers here.

0307454541|5.0|On the back, the first word I saw on the back of the book was 'Mesmerizing,' and it is.  It is not that the story is so full of innuendos or literary allusions, it is just a really good story that holds your interest.  I can think of about eight (8) people who will be reading this copy, because we will highly recommending it.<br /> At first there is the oddity of a journalist, Mikael Blomkvist,  being convicted of libel, justly or not, he does not do much of anything in his defense.  Then you are introduced to a security firm, Milton Security, and it's people.  An industrialist has certain mystery he would like solved, and the journalist, being at loose ends would be a good choice to help.  The security firm was hired to report accordingly, so the industrialist is not taken or duped.<br /> Mr. Blomkvist does not want the job, but he has little options and the money is good, so he takes on the job.  There is a bit of subterfuge most everyone sees through, but the job is developed and worked through to a point where he needs an assistant to help do the footwork.  He checks with his employer about the security firm and their report on him, can they help work this mystery out.<br /> The girl with the dragon tattoo, Lisbeth Salanger, is an oddity.  She is a hacker and has other peculiarities that make her an excellent investigator.  She is also socially inept.  That is partly why she has tattoos: a sign of her social outcasthood.  These two become a team and solve the mystery.<br /> There is a lot of meanness sprinkled throughout and the sections are introduced by statistics of female abuse.  It is quite sad to read of it all, but it happens and, at least, in this story, something happens for the good of women.  The saddest part is the ending.  You could just cry, but you know it is just the way of the world, and no amount of wishing will make it any better.<br /> As a side comment, the translation includes American Society of Engineers measurements, which is okay, but antithetical to the culture of Sweden, so is an odd anomaly.  To be sure, for me it is easier to relate to a 700 square foot apartment, then a whatever square meter apartment, but we will have to adjust to be in sync with the rest of the world sooner or later.culture of Sweden, so is an odd anomaly.

B0013LPS8Y|5.0|\\"War\\" was the first U2 album I ever purchased back in the early 80s.  I've since gone on to purchase their whole collection & have become a huge fan.  It's great to hear where U2 started from & how they've grown to where they are now (this is actually their 3rd album). This is their album just before \\"Joshua Tree\\" where they took a leap into the world's R&R conscience.  Great whether you are a U2 fan or not.

B000VSAEYI|5.0|We bought this pool for our 16 month old twins.  They LOVE it.  It is a nice size - roomy enough for 5.  I can't imagine blowing it up manually, but it inflates in under 2 minutes using the air compressor. It has nice size drain plugs that are difficult enough to open that the kids can't get it open \\"accidentally.\\"  The part behind the slide is a separate compartment that can be filled independantly from the rest of the pool so it can be made deeper or more shallow.    Having aired the slide up via aircompressor it worked fine with wet kids and the sprinkler jets on for our 25-28lb kids.  They slid so well that it would have been nice if the end of the slide was a little further from the edge of the pool.    The edge height is great - high enough to fill the pool up 6 inches or so, but low enough that the kids can still easily get out on their own.    The sprinkler jets have a built in control valve which is nice as it keeps you from having to run back and forth to the hose valve.  Keep in mind though that the water is under pressure so it takes some time for the water to respond to changes.  It is also hard to adjust the valve in small increments (we wanted it up just a little, but kept getting it too high or too low when making adjustments.  We also have a section of sprinklers that tends to spray out instead of in the pool, but that might have something to do with the fact that the area isn't 100% level.    I can't speak to longevity as we have only had it for a couple of weeks, but thus far it seems to be holding air well (we haven't even had to top it off).  Even if we had to replace it every summer for the price and amount of time we have spent in it it would be well worth it.    Overall - really great buy.  Wish I had bought this one first!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Something happens to a story when it is adapted to a musical.  It's never the same.  I am a big fan of the book, but I understand theater, so it doesn't bother me.  The music is great.  Who knew little Kristen Chenoweth had such a big voice!  Idina Menzel was extraodinary and it was fun to hear Joel Grey again. I especially love \\"Popular\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\".  I have tickets to see the musical when it comes to town in the fall.  Can't wait!
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|This incarnation of Jules Verne's novel [[ASIN:0980921031 A Journey to the Center of the Earth (AD Classic)]] was really not much more than an excuse to make a cute 3D movie with the always popular Brendan Fraser as a Geologist in search of his missing brother. It also stars Anita Briem as a Mountain Guide/Love Interest and Josh Hutcherson as Fraser's nephew.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, but even with a healthy suspension of disbelief, this movie has so many holes and overly cute elements that it falls firmly into the same category as Looney Toon Cartoons for me. Except for one tear jerker scene (relatively short and needed to close a plot line), it is mostly comic mayhem and some bits of genuine excitement. It flows like a video game, moving from scene to scene at a hectic pace that most kids will enjoy.<br /><br />About the 3D: The DVD we received had the 2D version on one side and the 3D version on the other. It also came with four 3D glasses. The 3D shown in the theaters uses a completely different technology to produce the 3D effect than the type that is possible on home TVs. This resulted in a hugely disappointing experience for my family, as the 3D effect bothered all of our eyes. We toughed out the bad 3D for about 1/3rd of the movie before flipping it over and finishing with the 2D version.<br /><br />All in all, it is a fairly fun movie but it is completely disposable.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Robert Kenner's documentary food film demonstrates once again the public's hunger for a food ethic. As in previous films like Supersize Me and King Corn, the recipe for success is tried and, unfortunately, all too true. A few multi-national conglomerates, with the complicity of our federal regulatory agencies like the FDA and USDA, control a disproportionate amount of our food supply from farm to fork, to the detriment of public health, local farmers, international economies, exploited workers, the environment, and respect for animals. The sole corporate concern is a fat profit. If you are a farmer, you ought to think twice about challenging Monsanto. If you have children, consider that because of their \\"normal\\" diet, they have a 1 in 3 change of developing diabetes (1 in 2 if you are a minority). Much of this film is narrated by the understated Michael Pollan (The Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food) and Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation). Although the film includes some very brave and creative alternatives, it's been a long time since I left a movie theater feeling so angry and (the real tragedy) so helpless to do much about the problem. Manohla Dargis of the NYTs described Food, Inc. as \\"one of the scariest films of the year.\\"
B00005Y1UX|4.0|Indecent Proposal is an example of a whole film based on one old joke. The joke is a man asks a woman if she will make love with him for a million dollars.<br /><br />\\"OK,\\" she says.<br /><br />Then he says \\"how about five bucks and a candy bar?\\"<br /><br />\\"What kind of girl do you think I am,\\" milady protests.<br /><br />\\"We've already established that. Now we're haggling over price.\\"<br /><br />Rim shot.<br /><br />But seriously, this is another score for director Adrian Lyne. I think this movie is often parodied, but only because it really struck a chord for the viewing public. It has achieved icon status. You could argue that the characters are two dimensional, cardboard cut-outs, but actually, they are fleshed out adequately enough to make this movie work.<br /><br />I like Demi Moore as Real Estate Agent Diana Murphy in this. She is kind of feisty, but then she can also be vulnerable. She made a very convincing Real Estate Agent, too. Woody Harrelson is a little harder to buy as an architect, but he made it work.<br /><br />Robert Redford as the millionaire John Gage was very good. He was sort of Trumpesque, but without the bizarre comb over. This role was similar to when he played The Great Gatsby, but instead of Daisy, he is after Diana, or Demi.<br /><br />When he first makes the Indecent Proposal to David and Diana he brings up an interesting point:<br /><br />---------------------<br />John: Suppose... I were to offer you one million dollars for one night with your wife.<br />David: I'd assume you're kidding.<br />John: Let's pretend I'm not. What would you say?<br />Diana: He'd tell you to go to hell.<br />John: I didn't hear him.<br />David: I'd tell you to go to hell.<br />John: That's a reflex answer because you view the question as hypothetical. But let's say that there was real money backing it up. I'm not kidding. A million dollars. The night would come and go but the money could last a lifetime. Think of it. A million dollars. A lifetime of security... for one night. Don't answer right away. Just consider it; seriously?<br />===============================<br /><br />Indecent Proposal plays the hypothetical game of What If? well, stacking the deck, making it seem like a great deal, making it seem like an easy way out of all of your money problems.<br /><br />But just remember Murphy's Law, David Murphy: Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.<br /><br />Along with all the great architecture and real estate, look for cameos and supporting roles by Oliver Platt, Billy Bob Thornton, Rip Taylor, and Billy Connolly. Rip Taylor is a scream as Diana Moore's broker. John Gage really shows he has a lot of class when you see the pianist he has hired to serenade Diana.

B0015OKWL2|2.0|Take two of Hollywood's most capable actors, both with lustrous careers behind them and... throw them together in a boring movie with a mechanical predictable script devoid of worthwhile dialog or anything at all that would enable them to shine.  Add uninspired camerawork, tedious editing and mundane direction and you have Righteous Kill.<br /><br />DeNiro in particular should be brave enough to seek out scripts worthy of his talent.  Instead he's wasting the years with third-rate sausage-machine drivel like this and like Meet The Fockers.  What's the man thinking about?  Unlike 95% of Hollywood stars he can really act when he wants to.  Shame he's not making the kinds of movie that would be worthy of his talent.  Unless you are very undemanding indeed or a certifiable DeNiro groupie this is a movie to avoid.  Even the so-called \\"plot twist\\" at the end was boringly predictable - I called it after only 27 minutes into the film.
1401902197|3.0|The book was very good.  I found the cd disppointing because of the advertising comments included.
B000056QE5|5.0|An excellent classic to be added to your library - good songs, with the incomparable Julie Andrews to add quality to this recording!
0061537969|4.0|I love this take by the dog..what a fun way to write.  When I started reading about a elderly golden with hip problems in the beginning I was not sure I could get thru it as I own an 11 year ole one of them.  But the book was a fun read altho a sad one.  The ending turned out fine altho still sad.  I enjoyed it even tho it was not the best book I have ever read.
B001TH16DS|5.0|This product kicks butt!!  The episodes are great as always and the new CGI technology added to the Enterprise sequenced look great.  Also there are great added features to the disks that are fun to play with.  A great product and a must for any Trek fans.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|This is an incredible film for the right kind of viewer.  It is definitely not for everyone.  If you like industry, American history, dark complex characters, action and money, you'll love it.  If you are the kind of viewer who sometimes roots for the bad guy, you'll love it. This is not a movie for families or people who go to church every Sunday.  It is for people who like to see the underbelly of things.  We need more of this type of movie in my opinion.  Modern movies have become so sugar-coated.  I give it an A+.  However, I can totally understand how a lot of people would dislike it.  The movie itself is a little threatening and challenging and sinister.  Not for everyone, but an incredible film regardless.
B00125WAWS|4.0|1.  Since this is based on a true story, one already knows the outcome of the movie and although the acting is a bit overly dramatic and stereotypical at times, in the end it's a solid movie with an important theme / message etc..<br /><br />2.  A worthwhile movie for the entire family.
0060775858|5.0|Book Review by Michael J. Green \\"The Word Man\\"  In browsing the family bookcase today, I came across this jewel that I memorized many years ago as a first time parent. Wow what memories \\"Goodnight Moon\\" brought back. To see my precious first daughter and later her younger sister slowly slip into a state of rest while the inventory of items in \\"The Great Green Room\\" passed through their imaginations like we have been taught sheep are supposed to do. Well counting sheep has never worked for me. However, I can't begin to total the number of nights that I fell asleep at my daughter's side as the \\"Great Green Room\\" danced across our imaginations simultaneously. This is a wonderful bedtime story that brings parents and their young children closer together. Even after so many years have passed, it still brings smiles to our faces as we begin dreaming about reading the same book to our grandchildren.  In spite of being \\"light reading\\", the bright illustrations that accompany each pages exciting entrée make this book a must for helping kids to learn to identify everyday items that they see in their bedrooms and around the house. The associations made between the words and the illustrations are exciting, yet comforting as your baby's eyes gently close to enter them into a state of rest and preparation for another successful day ahead. My wife and I started reading this book to our babies as newborns, and they never lost interest until they outgrew bedtime stories completely. This was always the requested \\"last book of the day\\" and snoring could always be heard before the book closed (Sometimes it was me!).
B00127RAJY|4.0|This video is great. It has allowed to me to get into better shape at a progressive rate that was perfect for me. I became more toned and more healthy as the video constantly pushed me. This is a 20 minute workout that delivers.
0780021967|5.0|Finally, a beautiful DVD transfer of this wonderful early Hitchcock masterpiece. All the usual Criterion extras are there, but the most important thing is the film itself, which has previously been released in very inferior versions.  If you love Hitchcock, this is the one to get.
0312944926|1.0|No more Dan Brown for me :-) - I don't patronize his movies or his books anymore.  If you have read one, you have read them all.  If not, borrow ANY Dan Brown book from the library and you'll have all the Dan Brown plots for any of his farce-filled \\"historical\\" or \\"fantasy\\" books.<br /><br />Want a hint and avoid a trip to the library?  Brown's plots ALWAYS involve a passionate Valkyrie, a brilliant milk-toast professor, and a nemesis that is either 1) the evil Catholic Church or 2) an evil conservative government.  His writings even attributed a Bill Clinton Lewinsky tryst to a sitting conservative president.  How thick!  By the way, \\"Digital Fortress\\" takes a number two (as discussed above - what were you thinking?) track.  However, you may be like me and want to PROVE to yourself regarding the repetitiveness of Brown's plots.<br /><br />Yes, I purchased both Dan Brown's \\"Deception Point\\" and \\"Digital Fortress\\" and helped to fund the Dan Brown cult.  I have since sold them in a garage sale without barter - it is important that others educate themselves also.  As stated within my review regarding \\"Angels and Demons,\\" 100% of Dan Brown's works are moronic and very predictable. Of course, anyone is welcome to indulge.  God bless all and keep you safe from the socialist/communist element that is currently ruining our nation.
B000FIMG68|1.0|After watching this series I felt like I was a monkey with the producers holding a banana on the end of a stick.  Ultimately the story line is pointless, meandering, without any cohesive vision.  Just a series of ridiculous scenes following each other making one yearn for some ultimate meaning, which never surfaces, until you realize the real reason these people are on the island: to suck the brain cells out of your head and the money out of your wallet.
1596680180|5.0|I bought this book originally when I was looking for kumihimo books.  Although it really isn't a kumihino book, I have found it to be a great resource. It's filled with examples of braids that can be created using a variety of techniques - weaving, macrame (knotting), twisting, and looping to name a few - and the photos are terrific.<br /><br />In addition to a fairly extensive section that provides an overview of the techniques covered and includes a lot of step-by-step photos, there are pages and pages of glorious color photos of a large number of cords created using the various techniques discussed.  Another plus - a section on including beads in the cord and a section on finishing techniques.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book - it has endless uses are a reference.
0142405809|5.0|I bought this book for my son and we both loved it.  The story is interesting and touching with an ending that shows how even the smallest creature can make a big difference.  The illustrations are great as well.  Overall, this is a wonderful story for kids of all ages and I highly recommend it!
0553583182|4.0|I was a little bit disappointed, it wasn't the edition I had hoped for. Instead it was smaller, but it's still the exact same book so I was too entirely distraught. Book was in great condition just as promised =)
6304712499|2.0|I had always had a weird curiosity about this movie but I didn't even remember it existed until recently when a friend mentioned it during a discussion. He basically told me it was one of the worst movies he had ever seen and it peaked my interest even more because it didn't look THAT bad from the previews I remembered.<br /><br />The story/screenplay is laughable at best. The premise is cool and I know the actual comic book is much moe brutal and unrelenting(which is why this movie seemed like it had some hope, at least). The writers did a lot more telling than showing, however, and scenes like Spawn's \\"training\\" with Mr. old-guy-always-appearing-out-of-thin-air is just plain ridiculous. It took Luke years to gain even rudimentary knowledge of the Force in Star Wars and yet Spawn seems to learn how to use any ability he wants when a guy tells him that he has \\"trillions of nerves\\" he can control. Give me a break. Not only is this just plain bad writing, but the director doesn't even pass it off well by giving it at least some kind of weight. The scene takes all of a minute to develope and by the end Spawn is able to control more abilities than god just by \\"thinking\\" of performing the action. Awesome.<br /><br />The actors are likewise a travesty. The guy who plays Spawn doesn't have a fully-developed acting bone in his body. Gritting your teeth and talking like you're a badd-arse from the streets of south-side Chicago doesn't constitute believability. Martin Sheene makes his son Charlie look like the best actor in Hollywood, but I don't really blame him. I'm sure the director told him to camp up his performance so as to appear like a sadistic madman. The problem is that nothing is developed with his character. He just starts out at \\"madman\\" and end's at \\"madman.\\" The whole \\"Spawn fights for his gf\\" bologny is just as stupid. We never see them together and don't get any chance to inest feelings of compassion in either character. We just see a few flashbacks showing his laughable moments of closeness between Spawn and his cardboard gf. The Clown form of Violator was obnoxious and not even slightly funny. He goes from making harmless jokes that are PG-13 to R within the same sentence as well, which makes no sense. If he is going to be lude, make him lude the whole movie. If he is making jokes like Bob Saget, then let him do so for the whole movie. Mixing and matching just made no sense, as if he didn't want to offend poor Spawn. I don't know where to even begin on the other actors.<br /><br />The story was terrible. I don't know if it follows the comicbook all that closelly, but I would certainly hope not. Even something like Batman or the X-men often gives a lot of good writing and useful sections that help see the true character of the heroes. Granted, comicbooks offer didactic \\"good vs. evil\\" montages, but they're generally done quite well. The whole scheme to get Spawn to command the armies of Hell wasn't needed. They could have easily made him do it from the get-go, before he decided to fight for \\"good\\". I know they needed some kind of plot, but there are much better ways to try and bring these characters together.<br /><br />I was expecting some cool fight scenes at the very least. Violator is a great villian with a lot of potential, as are all of McFarlane's creations, the problem is that he is terribly portrayed yet again. He just runs around grabbing people instead of outright destroying them. He wouldn't toy with his victims by batting them around. Just freakin eat them or smash their faces in. Not only that, but how the heck does something that big and loud \\"hide\\" from Spawn on more than one occasion? Honestly. One chase scene doesn't even serve a purpose in the film other than to oblige action film fans who seem to think it's mandatory. Couldn't Spawn just fly around instead of riding a motorcycle? *sigh*<br /><br />The effects for Violator and Spawn's chains/cape were pretty well done for 1997, I will say, but thatsunfortunatelly the best part of the whole movie and that's not saying much. The effects usesd to create Hell were also poorly done. It looks more like a big red backdrop that someone threw a bag of Cheetos all over, it was not intimidating in any way(again, I think this was a poor choice by screenwriter/director to even include this setting when cg effects clearly weren't going to cut it in 1997).<br /><br />It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is certainly up there. From the terrible acting to the horrendous script to the poorly constructed \\"motivation\\" behind anyones actions, it's just a very bad film. I would hope that someone has the courage at some point soon to renew the interest in the franchise by making a legitimate film with todays technology. The most important part of any film to this day is still a great screenplay, however, and until we get that, this superhero has no hope. I only recommend this to filmmakers who wish to use it as a reference point for what NOT to do or avid fans of the comicbook.le movie and that's not saying much.

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games takes a hard concept, that parents would sacrifice their own children, and pulls it off. Not only does Suzanne pull it off, she sucks you into it in the process. It a story about love and friendship and takes a fresh look at the cost of survival - and sacrifice. The Hunger Games is well written and an easy read. I enjoyed it very much and I'm looking forward to the release of Catching Fire on September 1, 2009.
0385338724|5.0|I read anything by this author-this book was no exception. The story is great-perfect for reading when the weather is bad and you want to read soemthing to feel good. The book kept me interested all the way til the end. Maybe it's just me but her books are always \\"fluffy, fun reads\\". which I like when I want to change up things since I read everything from Patterson, Koontz, Cornwell, vampire genre, it's nice to read \\"chick lit\\" once in a while. Read all her books, except for Gate Crasher-I wasn't too impressed with that one.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I was skeptical when I heard that The Sarah Connor Chronicles was coming to the small screen.  How could it do justice to such a powerful big screen franchise in this medium?  Very well thank you.     I was won over almost immediately by the total experience of this series.  Rarely, does an amalgamation of diverse professionals come together in such a symbiotic relationship to deliver such wonderful entertainment. I waited anxiously for every new episode and watched each one.  Then surprisingly, for me, I bought the dvd.  I have *never* bought a seasons dvd for *any* TV show.  I would not have done that for just any show.    The totality of the TSCC experience is such that I can watch episodes over and over and each time I discover previously unnoticed nuances that entertain and delight me.  This show is more than a production of \\"pretty people\\" although, it does have an attractive cast.  Rather, all aspects of production work wonderfully together to enhance the viewing experience. The camera work is superb taking you through unexpected angles and perspectives that will delight you.  The direction makes the most of the talented cast's efforts. Most TV seems two dimensional, as if you were watching actors on a stage from 20 rows back. With TSCC however, the viewing experience is more three dimensional.  One feels as though they were actually standing in the kitchen during one the Connor family's discussions, for example, thanks again to direction and camera work.     The entire cast, lead and supporting, turn in excellent performances. Their characters grow as the story evolves and they are shaped by their experiences. Summer Glau deserves special notice as the inanimate machine   that in her portrayal of a human absorbs some traces of humanity whether intended or not. Her subtle presentation of this process is wonderful to watch. It could have been easily overplayed but instead Ms. Glau has struck the perfect balance.    The special effects and the action sequencesare excellent and tension filled. But, there is so much more to this series than explosions. There are wonderful interactions between cast members. There is comic relief in  black humor. There are deeper sociological and psychological aspects of the relationship between John and Cameron who enjoy an obvious bond that neither of them can understand, as Artificial Intelligence bonds to humanity and vice versa.     As good as the TV series was, it is even better when you can view the episodes without interruption and continue them at will. I will probably watch each episode 100 times before I can see and enjoy everything that is there to appreciate in this gem of a series.      It is very unfortunate that this show was not renewed.  Cancellation will  result in this unique assemblage of talent to scatter to other endeavors.  and that will result in the destruction of something beautiful and unique.     I anxiously await the release of Season 2 and will surely order it.
0061231401|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Doomsday Key by James Rollins, yet again I find that James Rollins has produced yet another wonderfully entertaining book.  James Rollins is an author that does his research and is able to weave that research into the stories that he presents.<br /><br />The Doomsday Key gives a lot of information to think about and James Rollins gives suggestions at the back of the book of additional books that will delve deeper into specific topics that were broached in The Doomsday Key.  The suggestions include books that deal with the archeological aspects of the Celts and the more disturbing genetically modified food issues.<br /><br />I am looking forward to his next book.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|If you are an Austen or Pride and Prejudice purist, you may not want to watch the last five minutes of this series. I found myself greatly surprised that Mr. Darcy ended up with Amanda Price, the modern day woman who gets sucked into P&P, and not with Elizabeth Bennet. In the movie, Miss Price constantly says how Darcy and Elizabeth are destined for one another and are the greatest love story ever told, yet Miss Price takes Darcy for herself at the end. I feel the ending would have been much better if Miss Price had returned to her own time (2008) and discovered that her boyfriend Michael was, in fact, her own version of Mr. Darcy and that she loved him.    Other than the ending, I found the DVD greatly amusing and found myself laughing out loud, gasping, and extremely interested in the plot. I also enjoyed the acting and thought most of the actors were very well-suited to their parts. Jemima Rooper as Amanda Price was superb, very funny and likable. I would recommend buying this DVD.
031606792X|4.0|I seem to be in the minority who loved the entire series. For some reason, Stephanie Meyer has rubbed off a lot of the critics and the reading public the wrong way and I don't doubt that a lot of readers did not enjoy the book apart from quibbling about her writing style. Personally I found Breaking Dawn the hardest read, as I had to get over my personal discomfort of watching the vulnerable and sweet Bella transform into a hard faced, blood sucking immortal. But once I managed to get past that, I thought it was a rather wonderful tale with a neat wrapping of all opens. I also found Edward developing wonderfully from boyfriend to responsible husband and father beautifully and his emotions were also great to follow up with.   There really were not too many ways she could have ended the story with, without making it an absolutely arty, sad and painful one - at the end of the day it is meant to be for YA and not a book by Emile Zola! I picked it up because its not Emile Zola and I for one, am glad there was no one in pain at the end of the saga
0375413405|5.0|There is not a single bad thing to say about this book. The team of Beck, Bertholle, and Child literally changed the way cookbooks are written, rethought the whole concept from the ground up, and sacrificed comprehensiveness for quality to create a book so epic that it changed the direction of American cuisine, gave the publisher pause about stealing the thunder from the then-hugely popular Dione Lucas, and turned Child (and to a lesser extent Beck) into a superstar, a universally loved culinary figure the likes of which we will probably never see again. Dozens of cookbook authors to come, from [[ASIN:0688146112 Barbara Tropp]], to [[ASIN:158479559X Alton Brown]], to [[ASIN:074758012X Anthony Bourdain]], to [[ASIN:076791659X Sara Moulton]], to [[ASIN:0375404317 Jacques Pépin]], to [[ASIN:0936184744 Christopher Kimball]], to (most reluctantly, given their mutual personal dislike) [[ASIN:0688152546 Madeleine Kamman]], have built their works on the outline that l'École des Trois Gourmandes created nearly five decades ago.     What E3G did was strip assumptions down to the bare bones and build up -- nowhere in the book was it considered a given that the reader had even a passing familiarity with French cuisine. The \\"Mastering\\" came in the focus on the basics -- a proper crêpe, a perfectly roasted leg of lamb, the platonic ideal of a green pea -- and thus created a book that, despite the advances in kitchen technology and the inevitable changes in tastes over the years, remains to this day one of the most critical books any would-be chef could possibly own.    And the food... well, let's not pretend it's good for you food. It's mid-20th century French food, no doubt heavily informed by the need to indulge during the long, difficult period of rebuilding after World War II. Butter and cream are used with abandon, and even the idea of vegetables as something to be endured rather than enjoyed is tossed away in favor of making them taste as good as possible. Baking is somewhat short-changed, but Beck and Child would come back a decade later with volume II to rectify that oversight. Overall, the book is less comprehensive than you'd think; this is because the publisher was somewhat put out by E3G's original, painfully detailed, frankly Knuthian effort and the authors decided to concentrate on quality over quantity.     The current 3rd edition essentially combines the somewhat updated text of the 1983 second edition (changes in certain ingredients and tools, plus the introduction of the food processor -- Child's favorite go-to appliance -- made it worth the effort) with a fair amount of historical material that's expanded on in the several biographies of Child on the market now; this certainly isn't to say an older edition wouldn't be a bargain of course, but you may at times have to relearn a few techniques. (And of course older editions seldom have the dust jacket; this will be a book that gets used and abused once you get into it.)     \\"Mastering\\" is, quite simply, one of the top five greatest cookbooks ever written in the English language. If you're a foodie of any stripe, but especially an American foodie, you suck if you don't own this book.
1594200106|5.0|There is little more for me to say than what I have in the title - this book is marvelous. The plot is thick and murky, much like Zafon's imagery, with unique and compelling characters that draw the reader in from the beginning, and that's the way I like it.<br /><br />A phenomenal weekend read, do not pass it up.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|One of Clint's best roles and best performance.  Tightly directed.  Very powerful and moving.  Should get Oscars for best picture and actor.
B000002J0B|5.0|On the last track \\"The Ocean\\" at around 1:34 it sounds like a scratch for about 30 seconds.  I didn't know if it was the cd, so I listened to two other versions, one from youtube and the other from a remastered box set on a friend's ipod, and the scratch is there also.  So it's just part of the original recording.  Great album.  Amazing from beginning to end.
0385737424|5.0|Miranda Sinclair was helping her Mom practice for the 20,000 Pyramid. It was 1979 and Dick Clark, who wasn't aging then and never would, was going to make her mother a winner (provided she didn't get paired up with some celebrity who was &#34;dumb as a bag of hair&#34;). Richard &#34;Mr. Perfect,&#34; her mother's boyfriend, said she was a Schl&uuml;sselkinder (latchkey kid), but she wasn't stuck in the house all the time. She did have friends she hung out with and some she wouldn't give the time of day. She hated Julia (who didn't count) and Sal, her best ever friend, drifted out of her life after Marcus clobbered him. Heck, she, Annamarie and Colin even got themselves a job working at Jimmy's store during lunch. Not bad for a bunch of twelve year olds!<br /><br />New York City wasn't a bad place and probably the only thing she had to worry about was that nutty &#34;laughing guy&#34; who always seemed to be hanging around. After Sal went out of her life things started to get a bit funky. The door was unlocked and the house key was missing. She started getting some really weird notes, one that read in part, &#34;I am coming to save your friend's life, and my own. I ask two favors. First, that you write me a letter. Second, that you remember to mention the location of your house key in the letter . . . &#34; Whoa, the key was already gone when she got that one. Just what was going on here?<br /><br />I wasn't sure where this book was headed or if I was even going to like it. The more I read the more confused I became. There were some of those real &#34;giggle moments,&#34; especially when Colin convinced Alice Evans that &#34;velour was a kind of animal fur&#34; and she wouldn't wear it, but that wasn't enough. All of a sudden things started to click and come together quite rapidly and BOOM! I understood what was going on. The intricacies of the plot suddenly melded together in an instant and I understood the author's intent. No spoiler here, but you can bank on this one being a real winner!being a real winner!

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this for my Peg Perego Aria OH stroller after looking at a lot of these.  I love it!  It has a stiff edge so it doesn't tip over and I can fit a 32 oz soda in the cup holder.  The cup holders are stretchy so it will hold all sizes of drinks (it doesn't hold a sippy cup, but I just put it in the middle)  And I can fold my stroller with it on.  I love it!
067960085X|5.0|\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" (1958) was a novella I read when it first came out, and this is my first rereading in low these many years. It has aged fairly well. The style is simple, straightforward, almost Hemingwayish. As objects of mirth, outlandish, eccentric, iconoclastic, bigger-than-life characters like Holly Golightly, My Sister Eileen, and Auntie Mame may have gone out of style and off the radar, or did they become clich&eacute;s and stereotypes?<br /> Holly has her dark glasses, her booze, her guitar, her cat, her messy apartment, and her love for Tiffany's, the famous jewelry store.<br /> It's a fast-paced story about the screwy young woman from downstairs who befriends the lonely writer living in the apartment above her. She calls him Fred after her brother. She is a \\"lopsided romantic\\" who likes older men, doesn't like being pinned down, and lives like a wild creature. Every Thursday she gets paid to visit mobster Sally Tomato in Sing Sing. Men give her fifty dollars for the powder room or a cab, and she has a slew of admirers, like Rusty Trawler or the dwarfish O.J. Berman who could have gotten her in the movies. She has her own innate integrity and honesty, even though she occasionally shoplifts.<br /> When the husband she deserted shows up to claim his child-bride and is rejected, she says, \\"Never love a wild thing.\\" Light-hearted Holly gets knocked around; friends desert her, she has a serious accident, a miscarriage, and gets arrested as part of a dope ring. She refers to death as \\"the fat woman.\\" For a time she takes in an equally nutty roommate, Mag Wildwood.<br /> It's a book of great originality with a breezy style, about life in Manhattan in the forties during World War II.<br />It's somewhat dated but not seriously so. It's a light weight story but one with a flicker of genius, a jigger of wit, and a pinch of literary larceny.<br /> Hollyisms:<br /> \\"I don't want to own anything until I know I've found the place where me and things belong together.\\"<br /> She puts down Fred and his writing by saying, \\"Everybody has to feel superior to somebody. But it's customary to present a little proof before you take the privilege.\\"<br /> \\"I'd rather have cancer than a dishonest heart.\\"<br /> \\"I may be rotten to the core, but: testify against a friend I will not.\\"r.\\"<br /> She puts down Fred and his writing by saying, \\"Everybody has to feel superior to somebody.

B0029LXGXG|5.0|Maxwell,  Your new release is wonderful. Thanks for the commentary and I can say that you lived up to your promise. I cannot wait for your return to Los Angeles. This release is worth the price of admission. The music and the lyrics will stay with you. This release will take people back to the old school days of Marvin Gaye, L.T.D, The O'Jays, The Whispers, The Commodores with Lionel and Earth, Wind, and Fire from the 70's and I can also compare you to Stevie Wonder and Prince especially if you listen to the musicians and the heart they added to this release.  Thank you for pouring your blood, sweat, and tears into a CD that celebrates your God given talent.

0192834436|5.0|What more can I say about Thackeray's Vanity Fair than what has been said already? It is a vast, sprawling, untidy, maddening, delightful, sarcastic, sometimes bewildering, magnificent and utterly enjoyable novel. When I picked it up to begin reading just two weeks ago I thought I might be in for a long haul, but the 877 pages have just flown by.<br /><br />Is there a character anywhere in English literature anything quite like the scheming, resourceful, amoral Becky Sharp? I doubt it. Everyone owes it to himself or herself to enjoy this great romp at least once in a lifetime.<br /><br />I would highly recommnend getting this Oxford World Classics paperback. It is a reprint of the 1908 Oxford edition and every one of Thackeray's own drawings is included, often highly amusing and clever at that.<br /><br />I would give if 5.5 stars if I could.

1932100660|5.0|The tremendous value of this life-altering book lies in how it can help you avoid or reverse the most common Western diseases (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disorders, etc).  The multitude of sound, scientific evidence presented is absolutely compelling.  The PhD author, who grew up on a dairy farm, has lofty credentials from Cornell, MIT, and Virginia Tech.  He presents extensive research that he and others around the world have done to demystify the relationship between diet and Western diseases.  The author was also the director of the most comprehensive human diet study ever done: The China Study.  His bottom line is that to avoid/reverse disease, minimize animal protein in your diet (meat, dairy & eggs).  Keep them less than 10% of your diet.  On only 5 weeks of this diet (and I was not following it to the letter), I enjoyed several exciting health benefits - and I didn't even have any diseases to start with.  The book also explains the forceful influences in industry, government, and academia that have prevented you from hearing about this before.
B001993Y2C|3.0|I loved this series. I just don't know if I could sit trough it all again only to have to watch the pathetic ending again with its \\"angels\\" hooie. Please tell me there's an alternate ending somewhere in this box.

0385333846|5.0|Where to begin?  I feel that many of the reviewers have already captured the essence of this novel, but I also feel compelled to add to it..  after all, how can one not?    Typically, I have not been a fan of science fiction/fantasy books, but let me assure those of you who have not yet read this due to its label, it is far beyond and separated from novels in such a genre.  I had heard of Kurt Vonnegut, but much to my present dismay, had distanced my literary choices from his work.  That has forever changed.    \\"Billy Pilgram\\" has left an impression on me that I may not be able to properly describe.  He is painted to be such a simple and almost uneventful character, that you'd imagine this person to bore you to tears.  However, you will learn that his life is far from simplicity and holds the burdens of heartbreak, insanity (or perhaps, just an overactive imagination that bleeds into his human character?), tolerance of negativities, and nonchalanticity (if I may create a word here), that entices the reader to feel those emotions as if their own.  Billy Pilgram does not ever seem to be confused, regardless of his travels through time and the experiences he is driven to live.  He is comfortable with what he is presented with, most likely due to the fact that he learns about fate and its inevitability.  You'll find yourself questioning your previous interpretation on time, war, imagination/dreams, love...      Although, coined into an anti-war mindset, it is not a novel that attempts to draw you into any specific stance.  That aspect alone, is masterfully done.  I wish authors of current affairs would be able to so delicately yet so simply describe their feelings without judgment, persuasion, or controversy.     This tale will make you smile, laugh, frown, scratch your head..  The Works.  You'll be pulled into another planet, a war, a marriage...  and may come to the conclusion that time is what we make of it.  It's an entity that we both take for granted and still ponder upon what to do with it.  Fate, destiny, they are much larger than our ability to control, and often times, fighting it or attempting to counteract it, will only yield the same result in the end, after all.  And so it goes. ;-)

B0013TXA5Y|1.0|Perhaps I am too old to enjoy this book but the dialogue and writing style were pathetic. I could not even get past 50 or so. It is definitely not for the 40 year old crowd who enjoyed the Twilight series.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|One of the catchiest sound tracks ever.  Leaves you with an \\"ear worm\\" that you can't get out of your head.  The thin plot holds together most of the popular ABBA songs.  Meryl Streep is amazing and very physical in this recreation of the Broadway hit.  Pierce Brosnan surprises with a capable singing voice.  Though I thought the ending a bit contrived, the Greek scenery was breath-taking.  Widescreen is the only way to go to capture all the beauty.  Christine Baranski was, as usual, fantastically funny.  In fact all the characters were likeable and the whole movie was upbeat and fun to watch, as well as sing-along worthy.  I find myself watching this DVD anytime I need a pick-me-up.  And then I dance around the house!
B001XJEKGC|5.0|This concert is about as sweet as a funnel cake with powdered sugar served with maple syrup on the side.Clapton and Winwood live from Madison Square garden.Just hearing that sentence makes me smile.Blind Faith was always one of my favorite albums and arguably one of the best album's made in it's era by musicians who are still currently living.It's so great to see them on stage still enjoying themselves after all these years.I actually prefer this concert to the last Crossroad's festival and my favorite part of that was when Winwood and Clapton palyed together.It is quite impressive to me that they chose to play as a five piece band.Winwood and Clapton take care of all the guitar work with one drummer,one bassist and a back up keyboard player for when Winwood shares the lead guitar work.It is quite revealing to me of how much of a brotherly confidence they have in eachother's abilities when sharing the stage.They had no need for three or four back up guitar players,for God's sake it's WINWOOD and CLAPTON!The performances are spectacular and it is neat to hear Eric and Stevie trading voacls too as they never did that in the sixties(Eric had not yet flowered as a vocalist).They do all the Blind Faith song's except \\"Sea of Joy\\" and \\"Do what you like\\".I do not know why they did not play those.(Maybe they did and they just left them off the dvd)Perhaps  because \\"Do what you like\\" was Ginger's song and \\"Sea of Joy\\" originally had a wonderful violin solo by Rick Gretch.After all they did not bill themselves as Blind Faith,but Winwood/Clapton.Certainly that is not reason enough for me to take away a star.The two Hendrix song's are sick and if any two musicians have earned the right to play them these guy's have.I also think \\"Sleeping in the Ground\\" is a highlight as Stevie shows his skills on an acoustic piano while Devouring the vocal.Come to think of it the whole Concert is a highlight and every single performance has an emotiononal authenticity that is more than welcome in this day and age.Clapton and Winwood seem to be as much a musical match as Simon and Garfunkel ever were.It would be neat to see them make a new studio album together,but then again it would be neat to ride a unicorn.Hey you never know.

B00243FQFA|3.0|When this series was on TV... I kept missing episodes because Sci-Fi was no longer on regular cable. So I'd catch it at other people's houses here and there. I started to get really confused and gave up and thought I'd just watch the entire season on DVD.<br /><br />After the DVDs arrived, I realised it wasn't just on TV. I felt like there was very little effor put into making the series flow on a constant timeline. I felt like this shortened season was constantly jumping between stories. I couldn't figure out what purpose for the life of me.<br /><br />Not to mention, some of the decision making seemed good, but ended strangly. Bringing back Dr. Weir was an awesome idea, but they forgot to bring back the same character. Same hair color. Same skin color. Nothing else was the same. They should have just left her in the computer as opposed to trying to have her recreate herself.<br /><br />As for relationship development, I was really disappointed. I got that they were a team.. but each character managed to stand alone. There wasn't a lot of emotion. I wasn't attached to anyone. When it ended... I wasn't upset with the ending... but I didn't enjoy it either? I felt like every episode was beginning to be the same. They start at the climax. There's some dramatic problem or fight with some alien -- and then they solved the problem.<br /><br />So... Minus one star for lack of character development ... The other for lack of sequence.

B00005JMXX|4.0|Day After Tomorrow / B00005JMXX<br /><br />Although disaster movies are often as a consequence of their very nature somewhat corny and soft-science-y, \\"Day after Tomorrow\\" can definitely be called the pageant queen of the disaster movie genre. Though the science is soft, the movie at least admits that what is happening is completely off the charts for expected (i.e. 'realistic') behavior, which is more than most movies are willing to admit (see, [[ASIN:B0000AKCKM The Core]]). And though the usual cast of disaster movie characters are present, including the ubiquitous Unreliable Dad Who Comes Through In The End, I was beyond pleased to note that the movie didn't belabor the characters by beating the particularly dead horse of disaster movie character tropes and, instead, just continued firmly on to the action. As such, we are spared all the \\"This is why we are divorced/separated/whiny!\\" dialogue between the Unreliable Dad and Sainted Mother as well as the reconciliatory \\"This is why we fell in love!\\" crap that is so often tagged onto the end of these sorts of movies. That consideration alone is worth a couple of stars.<br /><br />No, \\"Day After Tomorrow\\" is all about the special effects and action, and is *not* about character development, dialogue, or anything else except swiftly and efficiently killing off the majority of Earth's population. If that's what you watch disaster movies for, like I do, then prepare to be delighted. If, however, you want a lot of yammering dialogue to break up the scenes of everyone being slaughtered by expensive CGI effects, you'll be disappointed in \\"Day After Tomorrow\\" and will have to go back and re-watch [[ASIN:B00000G3PA Armageddon]].<br /><br />I really can't think of anything I didn't like about \\"Day After Tomorrow\\". The vice president is a realistically callous evil jerk without ever going overboard into pure stupid, there are several cutely humorous scenes that the movie wisely chooses not to belabor too much (including illegal immigration in the opposite direction than usual, and burning tax law books instead of philosophy ones), and the soft science is interesting to watch unfold. The protagonist kids aren't quite as smart as I'd like them to be, but compared to the usual disaster movie crew, they're pure geniuses. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Day After Tomorrow\\" because the characters are so smart (relative to the genre) that even when they do dumb things (like trek to an unknown library to rescue a single kid), they at least do these dumb disaster movie tasks in a smart way. And I appreciate that.<br /><br />I am tempted to give \\"Day After Tomorrow\\" five stars, but even the best of disaster movies is still a disaster movie at its heart. There isn't a lot of high drama or deep thoughts to take away from this (well, except \\"Global Warming is Bad\\", but surely we know this by now). So, instead, I'll justify giving it 'only' four stars on the grounds that I thought the ending was way too optimistic about humanity's chances and I would have preferred the movie go whole-hog and say that there was really no hope to recover and rebuild, an ending that Hollywood just doesn't seem brave enough to make.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollimmigration in the opposite direction than usual, and burning tax law books instead of philosophy ones), and the soft science is interesting to watch unfold.

0800141660|5.0|This film hardly needs another review...but it's one film that every time I see it come on by accident, I have to sit down and watch it. And I have the DVD of it. It's so beautifully done, and so faithful to Austen's book. It's amazing that almost 200 years after it's writing, so many are still drawn to Austen's work. She would be so surprised, and I hope pleased by the attention and love so many have for her words.     Emma Thompson did an incredible job in this film...without her expressive face, the film would have been significantly less. She embodied the part of the sensible sister who still hopes for love of her own...but who strives to care for her family as best she can. She's an example of undying devotion to both her family and her friends, and the men show that they are aware of her selflessness. The cast on a whole could not have been better, and like so many Austen films lately, the pictures of the lands and the homes of that time period in England are wonderful.    A great addition to any DVD library...

0425188809|5.0|As is customary with Koontz's earlier novels, Watchers has an intricate plot that involves secret Government experiments, dynamic and captivating characters, and - of course - a dog.      The novel begins with the character Travis wandering alone out in the woods, presumably to kill himself. A traumatic past has brought him to a place of emotional isolation and loneliness, leaving him bitter and untrusting. Enter the dog (who is later aptly named Einstein), who finds Travis in the woods and alerts him to a dangerous presence in the woods.     Thus begins a long chase that introduces us to a wide variety of characters, including a delusional germophobe hit man, a mouse-like woman who is recovering from having lived under an emotionally tyrannical mother, a guilt-ridden workaholic NSA agent who is trying to keep a friendship together, and the Mr. Hyde to the Dr. Jekyll that is Einstein.     The power of love, free will, and destiny and among the themes woven into this suspenseful and at times violent story. Characters are linked together in interesting ways, and the chain of events that they cause rivet your attention until the last page.    Watchers is Koontz's shining achievement in a career full of great novels. There is virtually nothing to complain about. You could nit pick and point out that Government experiments and love's binding power are common topics in Koontz's novels, but he approaches it with a fresh take here. The monster that is hunting throughout the novel is truly terrifying in a variety of ways. Also, the plot is complex for a suspense/horror novel, and the twists it takes are rewarding.     Watchers is a must-read for any fan of suspense fiction, no matter what genre you prefer. Horror, sci-fi, romance - Koontz touches on them all.
0156027321|5.0|I read this fine book at the recommendation of a friend at work. I will admit that I had to soldier through the first 10 pages or so, but once the central character is at sea and his ordeal began, I couldn't put it down. The book is well written and engaging. The ending left me guessing (as I'm sure it was meant to) as to whether the protagonist truly underwent the events in the book or if it was something much more sinister and the tale was simply a way to avoid the eventual madness that might result if the elder version of the child on the boat were to dwell upon the nightmarish reality of his voyage.    I highly recommend this read to any reader. Readers both young adult to those who are more seasoned will find it engrossing.

Watchers is a must-read for any fan of suspense fiction, no matter what genre you prefer. Horror, sci-fi, romance - Koontz touches on them all.
B00004TH7Z|3.0|If you buy this album expecting to hear songs that sound like Run to the Hills,The Trooper,Two Minutes to Midnight and Wasted Years,then you better break out your old albums because this isn't going to sound like that.Brave New World is your typical post 80's Maiden album which I would describe as good,but not great and this is not Iron Maiden the way I remembered them when I first became a fan.I miss the good ol days.    Gone are the trademark neo classical guitar riffs which were a hallmark of their early work.The songwriting,for the most part is pretty lame but there are few good ones like the first two songs, Wicker Man and Ghost of the Navigator which had some fast guitar riffs.After that,it drops off and doesn't get your attention again until Mercenary,Fallen Angel and Out of the Silent Planet which has a catchy chorus more than anything else.Blood Brothers was weak and other songs were way too long and sounded boring and made me want to skip to the next track.Nicko McBrain's drumming was impressive and was one of the few high points of the album.It sounds like he has a new drum kit.    Brave New World is a welcome return for singer Bruce Dickinson who sounded great but this is not Maiden's best work by any means.It sounded better than their 90's albums but does not measure up to their classic 80's albums which were more aggressive and artistic sounding and was by far,their best work.If you long for the good ol days of Bruce and Co.you might want to pass on this one.

His journey takes him in many different directions from writing a short history of running, to exploring new ways of running and finally realizing that running should be a joy and not just a race for a new personal best time.<br /><br />If you are a runner, this book will help focus your energies as well as affirm that running can be and should be a joyous experience. I'm a walker who longs to run, but each time I do, I suffer injury. This book has given me hope that maybe I'll be able to return to running without hurting myself!
B002DMJLTE|4.0|Well having read most of the other reviews of this film I have to say that the title 'Deep Impact' is more a reference to the deep emotional impact Mimi Leder was trying to create and sucessfully did evoke.      One other aspect of this film is it's attempt to scare you with science.  What better way to create a feeling of dread than to be as factual as you can and I think this is apparent in her film and greatly enhances the impact as the film draws to it's moving closure.  Of course not everything in the film matches up to proper physics, but the imperfections are minor and as previously stated we as an audience are far more interested in the fate of the characters as we grow to care for  them and every scene where we see them having to make life or death decisions rings true.    This film shows how not to make a claptrap disaster movie driven only by big budget special effects.  Make your characters believable so you can empathise with them.    Deep Impact.....always moves me when I watch it and makes that other 'film'...look like a bad 'Lost in Space' episode...
B000000XB9|5.0|I have never seen any other band to be so masterfully chronicled on a single CD. I got this as a birthday gift on cassette format (those were the days) from a very close high-school friend about 12 or 13 years ago, when I had no idea who or what CCR was. This collection has all of CCR's single A-sides, plus \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\\". All of their best is here, and everything here is top-notch. I subsequently bought CCR's full discography, but still prefer to pop this baby when I want to listen to them.
0307266303|5.0|Anybody who's read the title to this and the synopsis, if they're still interested in the book, will find it succeeds at meeting expectations.    This is part story, part how-to, part history of running, but it's probably the best book I've read on running in general (though Noake's Lore of Running is still a home-run from the scientific side of things, albeit that book lacks much talk of actual running technique, to its detriment). It touches upon areas that other books hit on in more depth, but in their cases only in their respective areas.    This book briefs concepts introduced to me in detail by Bernard Heinrich's Why We Run, and failed to shock me with ultrarunning in general (Ultramarathon Man was the first I'd read about it), but I think anybody who likes running as something more than a morning grind four times/week to keep the weight off would enjoy this book.    Dare I say it's one of the very few in my life I may actually read twice, and that says a lot.    By the way, don't be scared by the 2 min vid on Amazon by the author. You won't, after reading this, feel a need to run around a city in sandals of Vibram Five Fingers. There are other minimalist approaches that look more normal (running flats is one, although they are still thicker than five fingers), if you want to adopt the running style mentioned in this book--and I truly think you ought to at least try it a little bit over time.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|ERIC CLAPTON & STEVE WINWOOD - LIVE IN CONCERT at THE VERIZON CENTER, WASHINGTON, DC on JUNE 13, 2009 and at MADISON SQUARE GARDEN (CD and DVD)<br /><br />I have never seen a welcoming response from an audience that expressed as sincere and voluminous adulation on their part than I did when Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood took the stage of the Verizon Center in Washington, DC on June 13,  2009. It was a Saturday evening, and the excitement was high! The audience just EXPLODED with overwhelming joy and appreciation - before even a single note had been played!<br /><br />The mutual admiration, affection, and respect that these two gentleman and fine musicians have for each other is sincere, profound, and quite evident when you see them interact with each other on stage, live in concert. It comes across on the CD and DVD of the Madison Square Garden date as well. Truly refined, aristocratic gentlemen with egalitarian, working class backgrounds are what these two individuals exude on stage before an audience, and the audience respects them for it. They are professionals, if nothing else, and they relate to the rest of the band members as well as the audience with the respect that they deserve.<br /><br />Chris Stainton on keyboards, Willie Weeks on bass, and Ian Thomas on drums backed them up at Madison Square Garden, and Abe Laboriel Jr. was on drums at the Verizon Center concert. With George Harrison's bass player, Paul McCartney's drummer, and Eric Clapton himself having played with The Beatles, George Harrison, and John Lennon on many occasions, it was almost like a Beatles / Blind Faith re-union concert. There was magic in the air in DC this night, and it comes across on the DVD of the Madison Square Garden event as well. The CD has all of the songs of disc one of the DVD plus Low Down (which is on disc two of the DVD), but the DVD also has some other songs on disc two, like Crossroads and Kind Hearted Woman - all from the Madison Square Garden event, as well as an acoustic, sound check, solo performance by Eric on his \\"Eric Clapton\\" Martin guitar of Rambling On My Mind, by Robert Johnson, one of Eric's musical inspirations.<br /><br />The whole concert was recorded and mixed by James Towler, and he did a fine job. The acoustics are superb. I imagine the original, multi-track, master audio tapes are digital, not analog, but in what format, bit resolution, and sampling rate the music was recorded is not documented in either the CD or DVD liner notes. But don't worry, whether you worship the analog wave or the digital dots, the sound is superb. Pure magic!<br /><br />Track 1, as well as the DC concert, begins with Had To Cry Today. From the moment you first hear the famous 19-note double guitar and bass riff, you know this is going to be good. Clapton takes the solo while Steve and Willie continue repeating the riff. At 5:15 they both solo together. Amazing! ... I often wonder if this song inspired the double lead guitar sound of The Allman Brothers.<br /><br />Track 2, as well as the DC concert, is Low Down - a Lay Down Sally type of fast shuffle song. Nice! ... This song does not appear on disc one of the DVD, but on disc 2.<br /><br />Track 3, is Them Changes. I think it is an even a better performance than the one by Jimi Hendrix and the Band of Gypsies live at the Fillmore East. Eric starts off the song with a very short homage to \\"Purple Haze.\\" Steve sings this with pure soul. Ian Thomas is a great drummer. They did not play this song in DC. In DC, they played After Midnight as the third song, and it was an outstanding performance.<br /><br />Track 4 is Forever Man. In DC, they played this as the eleventh song of the evening (with tambourine). Clapton and Winwood alternated vocals on the verses as they did with many of the songs this evening. Eric is ripping on guitar on this one!<br /><br />Track 5, as well as the DC concert, is Sleeping In The Ground. It has that Spencer Davis Group sound. Chris Stainton really excels onthe keyboards on this blues gem.<br /><br />Track 6 is Presence Of The Lord. In DC, they played this as the fourth song. Again, Eric and Steve both sing in this song, and Steve really shines, breathing extra soul into Eric's beautiful and spiritual song. Eric has a passionate, lower range, raspy vocal, whereas Steve has a soulful, higher range, velvety vocal. They blend very well together. This song is a real treat if only for the fact that it features Eric using his famous wah-wah peddle during the guitar solo, starting at 2 minutes and 37 seconds into the song. Also, you can actually see him bending strings up and down all over the neck, high strings as well as low strings. Wow! Now you know why they used to write \\"Clapton Is God\\" on the walls in London in the mid sixties. There are many great guitarists in this world, and Eric honors and graciously pays tribute to many of them during his Crossroads Concerts, but when this man cuts loose on the guitar - though there may be faster, jazzier, and louder players than him - few can match his passionate, pristine virtuosity and sheer brilliance of tone. It's grace in action! To see and hear them play this classic, live in concert - being in the same room with them, less than a hundred feet away from the stage - is a thrill of a lifetime.<br /><br />Track 7 is Glad. In DC, they played this as the sixth song. What a joy to hear this Blind Faith tune performed live with this band! Again, Clapton rips the frets off the guitar neck on this one, and Winwood lays down that intricate piano riff with jazzy joy. During both concerts, Steve alternates between the acoustic, Yamaha, grand piano and the Hammond organ with the rotating Leslie speaker cabinets, depending on the song. Stainton, who also plays piano and organ on the synthesizer (depending on which keyboard Steve is playing at any one time), is great on the organ. The DC concert also had all the magic of the Garden show.<br /><br />Track 8 is Well All Right. In DC, they played this as the seventh song. At both concerts, they captured the magic of the original album version. It has that Traffic-sounding, Dave Mason groove to it, though it's a Blind Faith song. Chris Stainton excels on the synthesizer on this tune, as does Ian Thomas on the drums (simulating Ginger Baker's short \\"splash\\" cymbal crashes!) at the beginning of the tune. In DC, they played the song called Tuff Luck.<br /><br />Track 9 is Double Trouble. They did not play this song in DC. Clapton wails so hard and sings so passionately on this blues number that the crowd went wild. Watching the DVD, you can sense the excitement of the audience and their respect for this true, traveling blues man. He was playing so fast that I could not keep up with him. The tone of his notes is warm and tube-like - three dimensional and dripping hot.<br /><br />Track 10 is Pearly Queen. In DC, they played this as the ninth song. Again, I think this is better than the original version. It is so good. The drummers are both great on this song! ... Man, you'll think you're listening to a resurrected Traffic - but better! It's nice to hear Eric's touch on this tune. I don't know if he's using the wah-wah or some other peddle (maybe a bit of \\"phase\\"?) on this song, but whatever it is, it works. These guys should record some new songs together and go out on tour again, getting into some \\"deeper cuts\\" from both of their respective repertoires.<br /><br />Track 11 is Tell The Truth. In DC, they played Forever Man. This Derek & The Dominoes classic has some echoes of Cream and Delaney & Bonnie and Friends reverberating through this song. Again, Chris Stainton is awesome on this one. Clapton and Winwood sing their hearts out, and harmonize most excellently together.  It is truly an outstanding performance all around. What passion and positive energy!<br /><br />Track 12 is No Face, No Name, No Number. In DC, they played Little Wing, and this song as the tenth song. Both performances - live and on the DVD - were so soulful and moving. I have always believed in my heart that Steve Winwood has one of the most beautiful voices in the world, and definitely one of the top three greatest voices of all time in the world of Rock and Roll music - if not the best of all. He has always been my favorite singer. This man can truly wail and hit all of those sliding scale notes that lie between the notes of the 12-tone, western scale system of musical notation developed by Bach for the piano. This beautiful song and melody is like a soulful and plaintive, passionate prayer performed by a human being with an incredible amount of gentle sensitivity and grace. As the great poet, John Keats, once wrote, \\"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\\" ... Amen.<br /><br />Track 13 (Track 1 on CD disc 2) is After Midnight. In DC, they played this as the third song. J.J. Cale would be proud. As I said above, it was an outstanding performance of this classic song from Eric's first solo album. It had less of a laid-back feel and more of a faster, rock groove this time. It was a fiery and assertive performance, for sure. I know that in DC, the audience absolutely loved it. Smokin'! ... In DC, they played Georgia On My Mind as the thirteenth song.<br /><br />Track 14 (Track 2 on CD disc 2) is Split Decision . This is absolutely another powerful vocal delivery from Mr. Winwood. His beautiful voice sounds like it hasn't aged a day. The beginning of this song sounds like it could have been a Joe Walsh song or the beginning of Badge. They did not play this song in DC. Instead, they played Driftin'.<br /><br />Track 15 (Track 3 on the CD disc 2) is Rambling On My Mind. Mr. Clapton performed this blues masterpiece as a solo performance on his very own, signature series, \\"EC\\" (for Eric Clapton), Martin, acoustic guitar while sitting down in a chair at the front of the stage. Eric Clapton can play an acoustic, steel string guitar as equally impressive as he can play an electric, steel string guitar. Robert Johnson is smiling up in heaven. (It's funny, but on the CD, you hear more of the higher toned sound from the internal, guitar pickup, whereas on the DVD, you can hear more of a blend of the lower toned sound from the small, condenser microphone along with the pickup; something to be said for the greater 24 bit resolution of DVD's and Blu-ray discs in capturing the bottom end and lower bass notes!) They did not play this song in DC. Instead, they played Nobody Knows You.<br /><br />Track 16 (Track 4 on CD disc 2) is Georgia On My Mind. Steve Winwood performed this gospel-like standard as a solo performance on the Hammond organ played through the rotating horns of the now, famous, Leslie speaker cabinets that always seem to be coupled with Hammond organs. In DC, they played this as the thirteenth song of the evening. Both performances are absolutely stunning in soulfulness and outstanding in technical delivery on the keys. So sad, sweet, and soulful. It's like he's raising the spirit of Ray Charles from the dead like Jesus raised Lazarus out of the tomb. What soul this man has! ... In DC, they played an acoustic version of Layla together, with Steve on guitar, joining Eric on acoustic guitar. It was like DC Unplugged! Having Steve Winwood join Eric Clapton on Layla adds a whole new dimension to this classic, musical masterpiece. You had to have been there! Incredible beauty and grace.<br /><br />Track 17 (Track 5 on CD disc 2) is Little Wing. In DC, they played Can't Find My Way Home as the seventeenth song. Recorded by The Jimi Hendrix Experience on Axis: Bold As Love, this song has become a mainstay of Eric Clapton's career and repertoire since the days of the Dominoes when he first performed it with Duane Allman. He has always put his heart and soul into this beautiful song, but this night - in both places, DC as well as New York - as he is joined by his good friend, Steve Winwood, he seems to even be transcending himself, let alone Hendrix. His singing is great, too. Wow! ... Again, you had to have been there. It literally took my breath away. So beautiful. Great drums! This is definitely one of the most beautiful songs ever written by Jimi Hendrix, or anyone for that matter. Thank God for modern recording technology and the outstanding playback mediums of DVD and Blu-ray discs. It's like you can be right there all over again. Just like at the concerts, where the camera zoomed in on the fingers of the guitarists and projected the images up onto the giant video screens on either side of the stage, you can watch the same thing all over again right in your own living room. Slow that speed down, and learn how to play the licks by watching their fingers - if you dare!<br /><br />Track 18 (Track 6 on CD disc 2) is Voodoo Chile. In DC, they played Crossroads as the eighteenth song. Steve Winwood played organ on the original, Electric Ladyland album recording of Voodoo Chile. Jack Casady, from Jefferson Airplane and Hot Tuna, played bass. Of course, Jimi Hendrix sang and played guitar. To hear this masterpiece sung by Stevie Winwood while Eric Clapton resurrects the spirit of Jimi Hendrix on guitar is too much. This performance is absolutely transcendent in every way. Close your eyes and just listen! Shades of Deep Purple's organ sound join with the amazing drumming of Ian Thomas to blow your mind. In concert in DC, Abe Laboriel Jr. really put all of his heart and soul into this one. More than once, I saw drumsticks flying out of his hands and floating up and back over his head into the area behind the stage. Sparks were flying. Mojo was working. The great groove was like a wave in Hawaii heading toward the beach to crash in a million water droplets of foam onto the warm, tropical sand - only it was musical notes swirling around your brain and dropping on your head. The long, extended performance of this space-blues masterpiece is as trippy as it gets. This is not dance music. This is head music par excellance! The exhibition of performance dynamics by the whole band is perfect. Eric does good. What a tribute and homage to Jimi Hendrix! Whew! ... In DC, Crossroads has to have been the best performance of that song I have ever heard, live or on record. It was that good. Eric Clapton let loose on this so passionately that the crowd went absolutely wild. I could not believe my eyes and ears. Again, you had to have been there. Crossroads does not appear on the CD or on the New York concert DVD on disc one, but it is definitely there as a \\"bonus\\" performance on disc 2 of the DVD. Watch it and get \\"wow-ed\\"!<br /><br />Track 19 (Track 7 on CD disc 2) is Can't Find My Way Home. In DC, they played Voodoo Chile as the nineteenth song. I have always loved this beautiful song from the Blind Faith album, having jammed on it a number of times. Steve and Eric both play guitar on this one. Steve does most of the singing, but Eric joins him a bit during the choruses and at the end. So soulful. What a beautiful song. What a pleasure to be able to finally hear it performed live by the two men who originally recorded it. Steve Winwood is an excellent guitarist, by the way. It appeared as if he was playing some kind of semi-hollow body, acoustic, black, Fender Telecaster. What a tone! Like Paul McCartney, this man can do it all - and very well. I think the performance in DC was even better than the one in New York. Outstanding!<br /><br />Track 20 (Track 8 on CD disc 2) is Dear Mr. Fantasy. In DC, they played Cocaine as the last song of the evening, and Dear Mr. Fantasy as the encore after coming back to the stage. In New York, captured here on the CD and DVD, it was exactly reversed. Let's face it, we've all heard this song a gazillion times on the radio. What majestic beauty and mystical, sonic magic! Everybody in the audience in DC was singing along all the way through. On the CD and DVD, when the song reaches 6 minutes and 43 seconds, we're treated to a little, double-lead interplay a la The End by The Beatles at the end of Abbey Road. The Clapton leads on this classic will send chills up your spine. And the Deep Purple-sounding organ at the end is killer! Live in concert, in DC, the ending was stretched out a bit longer to showcase the fine \\"dueling guitar\\" work of these two maestros and string wizards extraordinaire.<br /><br />Track 21 (Track 9 on CD disc 2) is Cocaine. In DC, they played Dear Mr. Fantasy as their encore. This was another sing-along. George Harrison may have sung that you \\"don't need no wah-wah,\\" but it sure helped to kick this song into a higher gear when Eric Clapton stomped down on his famous peddle at 1 minute and 17 seconds into the song. Chris Stainton excelled on his boogie-woogie, honky-tonk style of keyboard playing, ripping loose toward the end in an outburst of creative supernova energy! The DC concert was as powerful as the one in New York. People sang along and all shouted out \\"cocaine!\\" together at the very end of the song. A love fest.<br /><br />My one and only regret is that they never played Sea Of Joy, either in DC or in New York. I wonder why? I wonder if they will play it at any of the other concerts on the spring, 2009 tour? I hope so. It is truly a wonderful song. So many of us love that song so much. Neither did they play Do What You Like, but I can understand leaving that one out because it is so long. There is only so much time.<br /><br />All in all, both concerts are two of the best performances I have ever enjoyed in my lifetime. ... Do get the DVD, or Blu-ray version, of the New York show because the versions of Low Down, Kind Hearted Woman, and especially Crossroads are really good. Also, it's a real treat to see and hear Eric performing an informal and relaxed, sound check version of Rambling On My Mind. The other material, like the interviews, is really cool to watch as well.<br /><br />... YOWZA! - George Koumantzelis / The Aeolian Kidhe can play an electric, steel string guitar.

B002EULANU|4.0|Very smooth and soulful neo-soul album from top to bottom. The only draw back is the album is way too short. After an 8 year drought I was expecting at least a 15 track classic masterpiece.     Hopefully Maxwell fans dont have to wait another 8 years for his next album.

With George Harrison's bass player, Paul McCartney's drummer, and Eric Clapton himself having played with The Beatles, George Harrison, and John Lennon on many occasions, it was almost like a Beatles / Blind Faith re-union concert. There was magic in the air in DC this night, and it comes across on the DVD of the Madison Square Garden event as well. The CD has all of the songs of disc one of the DVD plus Low Down (which is on disc two of the DVD), but the DVD also has some other songs on disc two, like Crossroads and Kind Hearted Woman - all from the Madison Square Garden event, as well as an acoustic, sound check, solo performance by Eric on his \\"Eric Clapton\\" Martin guitar of Rambling On My Mind, by Robert Johnson, one of Eric's musical inspirations.<br /><br />The whole concert was recorded and mixed by James Towler, and he did a fine job. The acoustics are superb. I imagine the original, multi-track, master audio tapes are digital, not analog, but in what format, bit resolution, and sampling rate the music was recorded is not documented in either the CD or DVD liner notes. But don't worry, whether you worship the analog wave or the digital dots, the sound is superb. Pure magic!<br /><br />Track 1, as well as the DC concert, begins with Had To Cry Today. From the moment you first hear the famous 19-note double guitar and bass riff, you know this is going to be good. Clapton takes the solo while Steve and Willie continue repeating the riff. At 5:15 they both solo together. Amazing! ... I often wonder if this song inspired the double lead guitar sound of The Allman Brothers.<br /><br />Track 2, as well as the DC concert, is Low Down - a Lay Down Sally type of fast shuffle song. Nice! ... This song does not appear on disc one of the DVD, but on disc 2.<br /><br />Track 3, is Them Changes. I think it is an even a better performance than the one by Jimi Hendrix and the Band of Gypsies live at the Fillmore East. Eric starts off the song with a very short homage to \\"Purple Haze.\\" Steve sings this with pure soul. Ian Thomas is a great drummer. They did not play this song in DC. In DC, they played After Midnight as the third song, and it was an outstanding performance.<br /><br />Track 4 is Forever Man. In DC, they played this as the eleventh song of the evening (with tambourine). Clapton and Winwood alternated vocals on the verses as they did with many of the songs this evening. Eric is ripping on guitar on this one!<br /><br />Track 5, as well as the DC concert, is Sleeping In The Ground. It has that Spencer Davis Group sound. Chris Stainton really excels onthe keyboards on this blues gem.<br /><br />Track 6 is Presence Of The Lord. In DC, they played this as the fourth song. Again, Eric and Steve both sing in this song, and Steve really shines, breathing extra soul into Eric's beautiful and spiritual song. Eric has a passionate, lower range, raspy vocal, whereas Steve has a soulful, higher range, velvety vocal. They blend very well together. This song is a real treat if only for the fact that it features Eric using his famous wah-wah peddle during the guitar solo, starting at 2 minutes and 37 seconds into the song. Also, you can actually see him bending strings up and down all over the neck, high strings as well as low strings. Wow! Now you know why they used to write \\"Clapton Is God\\" on the walls in London in the mid sixties. There are many great guitarists in this world, and Eric honors and graciously pays tribute to many of them during his Crossroads Concerts, but when this man cuts loose on the guitar - though there may be faster, jazzier, and louder players than him - few can match his passionate, pristine virtuosity and sheer brilliance of tone. It's grace in action! To see and hear them play this classic, live in concert - being in the same room with them, less than a hundred feet away from the stage - is a thrill of a lifetime.<br /><br />Track 7 is Glad. In DC, they played this as the sixth song. What a joy to hear this Blind Faith tune performed live with this band! Again, Clapton rips the frets off the guitar neck on this one, and Winwood lays down that intricate piano riff with jazzy joy. During both concerts, Steve alternates between the acoustic, Yamaha, grand piano and the Hammond organ with the rotating Leslie speaker cabinets, depending on the song. Stainton, who also plays piano and organ on the synthesizer (depending on which keyboard Steve is playing at any one time), is great on the organ. The DC concert also had all the magic of the Garden show.<br /><br />Track 8 is Well All Right. In DC, they played this as the seventh song. At both concerts, they captured the magic of the original album version. It has that Traffic-sounding, Dave Mason groove to it, though it's a Blind Faith song. Chris Stainton excels on the synthesizer on this tune, as does Ian Thomas on the drums (simulating Ginger Baker's short \\"splash\\" cymbal crashes!) at the beginning of the tune. In DC, they played the song called Tuff Luck.<br /><br />Track 9 is Double Trouble. They did not play this song in DC. Clapton wails so hard and sings so passionately on this blues number that the crowd went wild. Watching the DVD, you can sense the excitement of the audience and their respect for this true, traveling blues man. He was playing so fast that I could not keep up with him. The tone of his notes is warm and tube-like - three dimensional and dripping hot.<br /><br />Track 10 is Pearly Queen. In DC, they played this as the ninth song. Again, I think this is better than the original version. It is so good. The drummers are both great on this song! ... Man, you'll think you're listening to a resurrected Traffic - but better! It's nice to hear Eric's touch on this tune. I don't know if he's using the wah-wah or some other peddle (maybe a bit of \\"phase\\"?) on this song, but whatever it is, it works. These guys should record some new songs together and go out on tour again, getting into some \\"deeper cuts\\" from both of their respective repertoires.<br /><br />Track 11 is Tell The Truth. In DC, they played Forever Man. This Derek & The Dominoes classic has some echoes of Cream and Delaney & Bonnie and Friends reverberating through this song. Again, Chris Stainton is awesome on this one. Clapton and Winwood sing their hearts out, and harmonize most excellently together.  It is truly an outstanding performance all around. What passion and positive energy!<br /><br />Track 12 is No Face, No Name, No Number. In DC, they played Little Wing, and this song as the tenth song. Both performances - live and on the DVD - were so soulful and moving. I have always believed in my heart that Steve Winwood has one of the most beautiful voices in the world, and definitely one of the top three greatest voices of all time in the world of Rock and Roll music - if not the best of all. He has always been my favorite singer. This man can truly wail and hit all of those sliding scale notes that lie between the notes of the 12-tone, western scale system of musical notation developed by Bach for the piano. This beautiful song and melody is like a soulful and plaintive, passionate prayer performed by a human being with an incredible amount of gentle sensitivity and grace. As the great poet, John Keats, once wrote, \\"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\\" ... Amen.<br /><br />Track 13 (Track 1 on CD disc 2) is After Midnight. In DC, they played this as the third song. J.J. Cale would be proud. As I said above, it was an outstanding performance of this classic song from Eric's first solo album. It had less of a laid-back feel and more of a faster, rock groove this time. It was a fiery and assertive performance, for sure. I know that in DC, the audience absolutely loved it. Smokin'! ... In DC, they played Georgia On My Mind as the thirteenth song.<br /><br />Track 14 (Track 2 on CD disc 2) is Split Decision . This is absolutely another powerful vocal delivery from Mr. Winwood. His beautiful voice sounds like it hasn't aged a day. The beginning of this song sounds like it could have been a Joe Walsh song or the beginning of Badge. They did not play this song in DC. Instead, they played Driftin'.<br /><br />Track 15 (Track 3 on the CD disc 2) is Rambling On My Mind. Mr. Clapton performed this blues masterpiece as a solo performance on his very own, signature series, \\"EC\\" (for Eric Clapton), Martin, acoustic guitar while sitting down in a chair at the front of the stage. Eric Clapton can play an acoustic, steel string guitar as equally impressive as he can play an electric, steel string guitar. Robert Johnson is smiling up in heaven. (It's funny, but on the CD, you hear more of the higher toned sound from the internal, guitar pickup, whereas on the DVD, you can hear more of a blend of the lower toned sound from the small, condenser microphone along with the pickup; something to be said for the greater 24 bit resolution of DVD's and Blu-ray discs in capturing the bottom end and lower bass notes!) They did not play this song in DC. Instead, they played Nobody Knows You.<br /><br />Track 16 (Track 4 on CD disc 2) is Georgia On My Mind. Steve Winwood performed this gospel-like standard as a solo performance on the Hammond organ played through the rotating horns of the now, famous, Leslie speaker cabinets that always seem to be coupled with Hammond organs. In DC, they played this as the thirteenth song of the evening. Both performances are absolutely stunning in soulfulness and outstanding in technical delivery on the keys. So sad, sweet, and soulful. It's like he's raising the spirit of Ray Charles from the dead like Jesus raised Lazarus out of the tomb. What soul this man has! ... In DC, they played an acoustic version of Layla together, with Steve on guitar, joining Eric on acoustic guitar. It was like DC Unplugged! Having Steve Winwood join Eric Clapton on Layla adds a whole new dimension to this classic, musical masterpiece. You had to have been there! Incredible beauty and grace.<br /><br />Track 17 (Track 5 on CD disc 2) is Little Wing. In DC, they played Can't Find My Way Home as the seventeenth song. Recorded by The Jimi Hendrix Experience on Axis: Bold As Love, this song has become a mainstay of Eric Clapton's career and repertoire since the days of the Dominoes when he first performed it with Duane Allman. He has always put his heart and soul into this beautiful song, but this night - in both places, DC as well as New York - as he is joined by his good friend, Steve Winwood, he seems to even be transcending himself, let alone Hendrix. His singing is great, too. Wow! ... Again, you had to have been there. It literally took my breath away. So beautiful. Great drums! This is definitely one of the most beautiful songs ever written by Jimi Hendrix, or anyone for that matter. Thank God for modern recording technology and the outstanding playback mediums of DVD and Blu-ray discs. It's like you can be right there all over again. Just like at the concerts, where the camera zoomed in on the fingers of the guitarists and projected the images up onto the giant video screens on either side of the stage, you can watch the same thing all over again right in your own living room. Slow that speed down, and learn how to play the licks by watching their fingers - if you dare!<br /><br />Track 18 (Track 6 on CD disc 2) is Voodoo Chile. In DC, they played Crossroads as the eighteenth song. Steve Winwood played organ on the original, Electric Ladyland album recording of Voodoo Chile. Jack Casady, from Jefferson Airplane and Hot Tuna, played bass. Of course, Jimi Hendrix sang and played guitar. To hear this masterpiece sung by Stevie Winwood while Eric Clapton resurrects the spirit of Jimi Hendrix on guitar is too much. This performance is absolutely transcendent in every way. Close your eyes and just listen! Shades of Deep Purple's organ sound join with the amazing drumming of Ian Thomas to blow your mind. In concert in DC, Abe Laboriel Jr. really put all of his heart and soul into this one. More than once, I saw drumsticks flying out of his hands and floating up and back over his head into the area behind the stage. Sparks were flying. Mojo was working. The great groove was like a wave in Hawaii heading toward the beach to crash in a million water droplets of foam onto the warm, tropical sand - only it was musical notes swirling around your brain and dropping on your head. The long, extended performance of this space-blues masterpiece is as trippy as it gets. This is not dance music. This is head music par excellance! The exhibition of performance dynamics by the whole band is perfect. Eric does good. What a tribute and homage to Jimi Hendrix! Whew! ... In DC, Crossroads has to have been the best performance of that song I have ever heard, live or on record. It was that good. Eric Clapton let loose on this so passionately that the crowd went absolutely wild. I could not believe my eyes and ears. Again, you had to have been there. Crossroads does not appear on the CD or on the New York concert DVD on disc one, but it is definitely there as a \\"bonus\\" performance on disc 2 of the DVD. Watch it and get \\"wow-ed\\"!<br /><br />Track 19 (Track 7 on CD disc 2) is Can't Find My Way Home. In DC, they played Voodoo Chile as the nineteenth song. I have always loved this beautiful song from the Blind Faith album, having jammed on it a number of times. Steve and Eric both play guitar on this one. Steve does most of the singing, but Eric joins him a bit during the choruses and at the end. So soulful. What a beautiful song. What a pleasure to be able to finally hear it performed live by the two men who originally recorded it. Steve Winwood is an excellent guitarist, by the way. It appeared as if he was playing some kind of semi-hollow body, acoustic, black, Fender Telecaster. What a tone! Like Paul McCartney, this man can do it all - and very well. I think the performance in DC was even better than the one in New York. Outstanding!<br /><br />Track 20 (Track 8 on CD disc 2) is Dear Mr. Fantasy. In DC, they played Cocaine as the last song of the evening, and Dear Mr. Fantasy as the encore after coming back to the stage. In New York, captured here on the CD and DVD, it was exactly reversed. Let's face it, we've all heard this song a gazillion times on the radio. What majestic beauty and mystical, sonic magic! Everybody in the audience in DC was singing along all the way through. On the CD and DVD, when the song reaches 6 minutes and 43 seconds, we're treated to a little, double-lead interplay a la The End by The Beatles at the end of Abbey Road. The Clapton leads on this classic will send chills up your spine. And the Deep Purple-sounding organ at the end is killer! Live in concert, in DC, the ending was stretched out a bit longer to showcase the fine \\"dueling guitar\\" work of these two maestros and string wizards extraordinaire.<br /><br />Track 21 (Track 9 on CD disc 2) is Cocaine. In DC, they played Dear Mr. Fantasy as their encore. This was another sing-along. George Harrison may have sung that you \\"don't need no wah-wah,\\" but it sure helped to kick this song into a higher gear when Eric Clapton stomped down on his famous peddle at 1 minute and 17 seconds into the song. Chris Stainton excelled on his boogie-woogie, honky-tonk style of keyboard playing, ripping loose toward the end in an outburst of creative supernova energy! The DC concert was as powerful as the one in New York. People sang along and all shouted out \\"cocaine!\\" together at the very end of the song. A love fest.<br /><br />My one and only regret is that they never played Sea Of Joy, either in DC or in New York. I wonder why? I wonder if they will play it at any of the other concerts on the spring, 2009 tour? I hope so. It is truly a wonderful song. So many of us love that song so much. Neither did they play Do What You Like, but I can understand leaving that one out because it is so long. There is only so much time.<br /><br />All in all, both concerts are two of the best performances I have ever enjoyed in my lifetime. ... Do get the DVD, or Blu-ray version, of the New York show because the versions of Low Down, Kind Hearted Woman, and especially Crossroads are really good. Also, it's a real treat to see and hear Eric performing an informal and relaxed, sound check version of Rambling On My Mind. The other material, like the interviews, is really cool to watch as well.<br /><br />... YOWZA! - George Koumantzelis / The Aeolian Kidhe can play an electric, steel string guitar. Robert Johnson is smiling up in heaven.

1416562605|4.0|This novel masquerades as a series of letters written by an Indian man, Balram Halwai, to the Premier of China explaining what it is to be an \\"entrepreneur.\\"  For Balram, the term \\"entrepreneur\\" is a euphemism for someone who has managed to rise above his caste, or social class, using whatever means required.  In his persistent climb to the top, Balram takes advantage of the fluidity of identity offered by an unstable society in a state of transition.  He assumes whatever position and character is most useful as he transforms himself from an uneducated village boy into a successful businessman in Bangalore.<br /><br />Despite his upbeat entrepreneurial message, Balram's narrative is filled with evidence of deep fissures in Indian society:  between the high castes and the low castes, between those living in the Darkness (the rural, poor areas) and those living in the Light (the big cities), and between the rich masters and their poor servants.  For Balram, these divisions reside within the body and are a kind of physical (and thus inescapable) marker:<br /><br />\\"A rich man's body is like a premium cotton pillow, white and soft and blank.  Ours are different.  My father's spine was a knotted rope, the kind that women use in villages to pull water from wells; the clavicle curved around his neck in high relief, like a dog's collar ....  The story of a poor man's life is written on his body, in a sharp pen.\\"<br /><br />Balram's letters are darkly humorous and written with a savage directness in consonance with the violence and immorality underlying his success.  The epistolary format feels like a clumsy literary device rather than a natural platform for Balram's story, but his story is engaging enough to overcome its inelegant construction.  Overall, The White Tiger is an interesting glimpse into a complicated society in transition.
B0000029LG|5.0|Two things bothered me while watching the Michael Jackson news stories on TV following his death..they always overlooked two of his finest albums, \\"Dangerous\\" and this set, \\"HIStory\\".<br />\\"HIStory\\" is a set that is the sound of Michael Jackson re-inventing and evolving as an artist.<br />Disc 1 features some of his biggest hits in its full unedited form (Unlike his other greatest hits set Number Ones), but with the unedited tracks comes the fact that so many of his hits weren't included!<br />For 1995 it was the only Michael Jackson best of compilation available on the market..and Im thankful more concise hits collections like \\"The Essential Michael Jackson\\" and \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" are available.<br />So if you want the hits, and all of them, please pick up those collections! Or even better, buy his 4 original albums! (Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad and Dangerous).<br />But as for this collection, all the songs are incredible and its a surprise to see songs like \\"She's Out Of My Life\\", \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", \\"Remember The Time\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" included in a collection where they usually omit those songs!<br />Overall, the songs are no doubt 5 star quality, but for the omissions of so many great songs I give Disc One: 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Disc 2 is the very sound of a tortured superstar under the pressure and scrutiny of the media. If you have heard all of his albums, this one right here easily earns the title of his most honest album.<br />Its a complete turnaround from his previous 4 albums. He's angry. He knows hes been hounded. And now hes writing and singing about all of his tribulations over his career, but mostly about the 1993-1994 era where he was accused of those disgusting (and in my opinion extremely false) allegations.<br /><br />Standout tracks:<br /><br />The disc begins with \\"Scream\\" a duet with his superstar sister Janet Jackson. The song is a loud, futuristic dance song about all the pressure the two siblings face. Its a great track, and was a big hit back in 1995. (It should have been bigger!)<br /><br />\\"They Don't Care About Us\\" is one of my all time favourite Michael tracks!<br />Its all about how he's been victimized and how he's basically had enough of all the hatred. Its an incredible song with such danceable qualities, with a heavy subject matter without resorting to over preaching.<br /><br />\\"Stranger In Moscow\\" is a window glimpse into Michaels mind during the 1993 allegations era. It is such an incredibly honest song as he sings about his \\"Fall from grace\\" and how it feels to be \\"Alone and cold inside\\". I believe that this is one of his greatest musical accomplishments.<br /><br />\\"Earth Song\\" is a typical MJ \\"Save the world\\" anthem, but its done to epic proprtions. Its a mammoth anthem, not preaching to people how to save the world, but basically how \\"no one gives a damn\\". It doesn't get better than this! Another overlooked gem in Michaels catalogue of work.<br /><br />\\"Money\\" is a song that doesnt sound like anything MJ had done before. Its basically all spoken word, and what he says about what people would do for money is spot on and extremely relevant to his experiences, and whats going on in the world today.<br /><br />\\"Come Together\\" is Michaels remake of The Beatles classic and I really enjoy this one too. Its a great remaking and its cool to have it on CD after seeing it on his Moonwalker film right at the end!<br /><br />\\"You Are Not Alone\\" is the 1996 mega smash and its a great ballad. Theres not much to say about this one, but you honestly cant help but sing along and get caught in the infectious chorus!<br /><br />\\"Childhood\\" is Michaels his most autobiographical song ever. Just listen to the lyrics..its not your typical Verse-Chorus-Verse-Bridge-Chorus song, its structure is intricate and his powerful lyrics are the main attraction to this song. The music alone can also be enough to bring someone to tears.<br /><br />\\"Tabloid Junkie\\" is another roaring dance numbersimilar to \\"Scream\\". It tells of how everyone shouldnt believe what they read or see. A great song that is usually overlooked!<br /><br />The rest of the tracks are also great (This Time Around, D.S., 2Bad, History, Little Susie and Smile) and are well worth a listen..they are great tracks, but those ones I just wrote about are my personal standouts.<br /><br />My overall rating for Disc Two is 5 stars.<br /><br />\\"HIStory\\" is the evolution of Michael Jackson from the beginning of his musical solo career to his honest later work. You will never hear Michael this honest, frank and autobiographical in any other album.<br />There are songs on the 2nd disc that I consider some of his finest work ever.<br />Just give it a try! Just because the television doesnt acknowledge this fine album (and Dangerous), it doesnt mean it isnt good.<br />Its a fantastic album and should be heard by anyone who considers themselves a Michael Jackson fan.<br /><br />R.I.P Michael Jackson! You many not be here on Earth, but I am so grateful you left your musical legacy with us, so people now and people in the future can discover how remarkable it really is!similar to \\"Scream\\".

0671027344|5.0|Stephen Chbosky's mind is intricate, yet simple. In Perks, he uses the character of Charlie to show the readers the honest mind of your average freshman. The catch is, Charlie isn't average. This book will bring into a world of drugs, sex, and death and the things Charlie goes through in high school. I've never read a book where I felt so connected to the main character. I recommend this book to anyone who has experienced high school or has ever had a moment that made them feel \\"infinite\\".
B0026JWDQW|3.0|Paolo Nutini is a talented guy, but this effort is disappointing.  The horns used on a couple of the songs sound like they'd be better suited for a mariachi band.  Considering it's been a couple or three years since his last album, this one falls way short, musically, lyrically, arrangement-wise, etc.  As you can tell, it's not an easy album for me to critique, because there's no soul to this one.  It's just a big BLAH.
B0019IB26I|5.0|If you're into artists like Eric Clapton or Steve Winwood, then you will enjoy this CD.      It has a 70s throwback sound with with some very good musical jams.  John Mayer is an accomplishted guitar player that can hold his own with other well known musicians (see youtube CrossRoads video with Eric Clapton).    The CD is broken into 3-distinct sets of acoustic, trio and full band and has a nice flow.  If you listen to the CD take a couple of hours out of your day and listen to it end to end to get the full concert effect.    The trio set has some good blues like the old standard \\"Everyday I have the Blues\\".  There are also a number of songs on this CD that really come life as live performances like \\"Good Love\\".
1416550542|5.0|I find myself telling strangers just how wonderful this book is while I am having lunch out.  People always ask me what I am reading, now that I am on to my next book, I am still recommending The Forgotten Garden.  My daughter even called me late one night to say she was still awake and it was my fault because she , too, could not put this book down.
1427208476|5.0|Historically this book was dead on. Julie became boring at times. I was horrified in regards to sarah and her brother. I could not imagine how they were treated. Such cold, calculated detachment from the French. It is difficult to believe that a policeman could do this type thing to young children in the neighborhood he worked in as a policeman.<br /><br />I will recommend this book to others it is a good read, but I think Julia was rather boorish in her constant lamentations on her husband. He was a jerk and she was silly in not seeing, unfortunately in 'real life' there are women that continue to turn a blind eye and enable men to use them as doormats, I can't understand why I am surprised when it happens in print!

B000L3CHC0|1.0|I have never seen such an awful seller before. They claimed no shipping fee and extra charge for returning. However, when UPS was not able to make the delivery, they first said the thing I ordered would be reshipped right away for free. After a week, they changed their mind, saying they need charge me for shipping fee. Finally they ended up charging me about $20 for shipping fee with nothing received by me...    Strongly suggest not to buy anything from this seller!
B00192IV0O|2.0|I don't know what they were thinking when they made this album, but as an avid BEPs fan, I was nowhere near impressed with this album.  Maybe they were thinking that they wanted to go another route, I don't know.  What I do know is that I felt like I wasted my money.    The album is composed of dance/trance/club type music.  If it was more club type, I would like it more, but I am just not into the robotic nature of this album (literally robotic voices and futuristic sounds).  I sometimes have to listen to albums more than once before  I like them, and when I did this with this album, I still did not like it.  It just seems like anyone could have done this album.  It doesn't have their signature on it.    Please return to your roots, BEPs or you will definitely lose this fan.
B00005K3OT|5.0|\\"The Maya believed cacao held the power to unlock hidden yearnings... and reveal destinies.\\" Okay. I don't have much use for chocolate, really, except for sippin' the occasional hot cuppa, and the cynical curmudgeon in me grumbles at the tradition of purchasing chocolate for your sweetheart (and don't even get the curmudgeon started on flowers). So I don't know that I buy into chocolate as a sort of universal panacea. But I did like CHOCOLAT, a film about sensuous magical realism and a shifting of status quo and the acceptance of things strange and new, and it's about romance and, of course, chocolat. The cynical curmudgeon in me just passed out.<br /><br />Journey back to 1959 and eyeball that tiny, quaint French village down there. Observe the air of \\"tranquilit&eacute;,\\" which for the purposes of this film is defined as staidness and, perhaps - no, definitely - repression. And also note the residents attending church, and that tamped down sense of vague discontent even as they worship. Then a heavy gust blows, and blows open the church door and also blows into town two red-cloaked figures which will change various lives before it's all over. I quote: \\"A sly wind blew in from the North.\\"<br /><br />The newcomers are Vianne Rocher and her daughter Anouk, and the tiny village is soon richer by the count of one humble chocolaterie, or a chocolate shop. As the movie audience promptly learns, the village's strings are pulled by the Comte de Reynaud, a pious gent who happens to be Mayor and whose wife may or may not be away on an extended holiday. As we also eventually learn, the Comte isn't truly a villainous soul, only that he believes he knows what is best for the community, this including observing Lent stringently and keeping at bay all things untoward and controversial. This last part, it would quickly dawn on the Mayor, would have to include tearing down Vianne Rocher, her business and her reputation. The Mayor would prefer his village to remain a sleepy one.<br /><br />Vianne enjoys walking around in her red shoes and being la vonne vivante and demonstrating that joie de vivre, and that about drains my French lexicon. It's made obvious early on that the movie's central conflict will revolve around Vianne's free-spirited nature and the Comte's attempts to stamp down that liveliness and sense of freedom. She's friendly and that's fine, but, in her exuberance, Vianne also thumbs her nose at proprieties and gently mocks the Mayor (\\"Can I interest you in some nipples of Venus?\\" she offers him.). She ignores the village's religious structure (and, by that, I mean she refuses to go to church), opening her shop during Lent (a time of abstinence and sincere penitence) and orchestrating a pagan chocolate spring festival at the same time as Easter Sunday. So, no, the Mayor doesn't enjoy having his moral superiority tweaked. We see the Mayor admonishing Vianne: \\"You don't misbehave here. It's just not done, did you know that?\\" Whispers abound about whether she's a radical or even an atheist.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Vianne does start making a few friends here and there, and her chocolate fineries are things of wonder. Vianne claims to know what sort of chocolate best suits her clientele, and this is the part where that opening sentence comes in. \\"The Maya believed cacao held the power to unlock hidden yearnings... and reveal destinies.\\" Soon Vianne is doling out delectables and remedies, although, as in the best of stories, these remedies work their mojo in an indirect way. Throughout all this, the mayor is busting her chops. And it all gets a lot worse when the river throws up several boatloads of families and drifters. Except, for the movie audience, this is where things really kick up a notch, because at this stage Vianne goes from serving mostly as a plot vessel to someone infinitely more human and more riveting.<br /><br />On board one of those boats is Roux, disarmingly, roguishly played by Johnny Depp, and he is, of course, Vianne's love interest. And, to play up the romantic tension, Vianne has a bit of trouble guessing which chocolate is right for Roux. Anyway, if one thought the Comte De Reynaud was unhappy before, imagine the state of apoplexy he achieves when river rats suddenly begin to sully his bailiwick. He can't say it aloud, but he's probably thinking: \\"Sacr&eacute; merde!\\"<br /><br />As the movie progresses, we learn about Vianne's parents and how her vagabond mother set her about her wandering ways, traveling village to village at the whims of the North wind, dispensing cacao remedies. We learn the cracks in Vianne's irrepressible nature and we learn that her daughter Anouk is unsettled enough with the lack of stability that she's invented an imaginary kangaroo friend as a form of security blanket. So it's not a fairy tale life after all, following the North wind.<br /><br />CHOCOLAT is a wonderful film, and makes me want to read Joanne Harris's novel, although, from what I understand, the role of the Big Bad was altered from being that of a priest in the book to that of the mayor in the film adaptation. Nevertheless, Alfred Molina is superlative, lending a depth and complexity and a melancholy to his character (see how forlornly he gazes at his wife's picture), elevating the Comte de Reynaud to beyond mere token villain status.<br /><br />It's the feel of the thing which I appreciate the most, I think. CHOCOLAT feels like a charming fairy tale peopled with real life characters. The tone is right away established with the narrator's voice over (supposedly the voice of a grown up Anouk) and the two wind-blown figures in red. The cinematography is exquisite, the exteriors shot in France (the little village is post card picturesque!), the interiors apparently filmed mostly in England's west country and just outside London. And the musical score perfectly supports whatever mood is invoked onscreen. So, okay, I don't know that the dialogue is all that brilliant, even though I did like it. What I do know is that the words in the script are enlivened by a cast of marvelous actors. The battered housewife, the embittered landlady estranged from her family, the repressed lovely assistant of the Comte, the widow who may or may not be grieving over her four-decades-gone husband... these are characters who develop as they fall under Vianne's cheerful ministrations and are themselves empowered. As portrayed by Lena Olin, a sublime Judi Dench, Carrie-Anne Moss, and a still vibrant Leslie Caron, they each add memorable color to CHOCOLAT. I should mention young and talented Victoire Thivisol, as well. She plays Anouk, and she impresses me enough that I aim to look up PONETTE, in which at only four years old she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival! How awesome is that?<br /><br />But it all falls on Juliette Binoche, ultimately, and her delightful performance transports the movie to a wonderful viewing experience. Juliette is older now, and yet she's just as exquisite in her maturity. She seems more solid, somehow, than when she was taking on those sex goddess parts in earlier films. As Vianne, I've never liked her more. And she's still beautiful, her inner light keeps on shining. I think the word I'm looking for is \\"luminous,\\" although that description's probably been beaten into the ground.<br /><br />CHOCOLAT is that same old package, really, done plenty of times and touting that same message, but this time it's presented with grace and a certain lightness. You get a smattering of romance. Quite a bit of prejudice. Religion, as a restricting engine, again gets a beating. The consumption of foods is just about equated to foreplay. And Johnny Depp plucks at a steel guitar. It's a fable that is comic and uplifting and also sensuous and passionate and excellently enacted. It's a fable, and yet it's inhabited with a core of emotional reality.<br /><br />Now, if they were to make a movie about my favorite candy, that sucker'd be called... CARAMEL. Does the North wind like caramel?e it. What I do know is that the words in the script are enlivened by a cast of marvelous actors.

0790729407|4.0|Michael Collins is quite possibly Irish director Neil Jordan's most powerful film. The problem is that the film was not widely seen on its release in 1997. Over time the film has lost some of the controvery surrounding it and viewed in retrospect stands as a tribute to Jordan's storytelling art.    Liam Neeson portrays the Irish revolutionary and statesman Michael Collins at the pivotal timeperiod 1916 until 1922. The film covers ground between the Easter uprising and the leader's death six years later. The cast is excellent and features Aiden Quinn as Harry Boland, Alan Rickman as Irish Republican President Eamon de Valera. If there is a weakness in the casting it is in the part of love interest Kitty Kearnan played by a very American sounding Julia Roberts.    The film has been criticized because Jordan changed some events to make the story flow better. I don't see this as a problem. All history involves revision depending on the author's take on the story. Many will compare this film to Mel Gibson's Braveheart but I feel that this is overall a better film.    A minor issue comes in the presentation. The film was an early release from Warner Brothers and the movie is contained on a double sided single layer flipper disc whicc calls for flipping with only about 30 minutes remaining in the film. The disc contains an episode of the London Weekend Television series The Southbank Show which is a quite good special feature. The documentary runs for about 50 minutes and covers both Collins' life and the production. For an evening  of historical drama you can't beat this one.    Highly recommended.
B001B1T7BU|3.0|This is one of those movies that truly is - and I don't mean to use the cliché - entertaining whether you are a kid or an adult. The dalmatians and other animals are a lot of fun to watch.    Glenn Close must have had a lot of fun making this film, playing the evil \\"Cruela De Vil.\\" Just as much fun, maybe more, were the two bumbling dog-nappers - Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams, I believe - idiots who were genuinely enjoyable to watch in their stupidity. Their dialog was hilarious.    There are nice colors in here, too, so a widescreen DVD is good to have if you enjoy this movie. I'd be curious to see how it would look with a good Blu-Ray transfer.    Speaking of clichés and such, there are some drawbacks here that were a little annoying to me, like overdoing the intelligence of the dogs, taking them to the absurd level level of being smarter than humans.. Also, you get the quick \\"film romance\\" in which two people (Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson) barely meet and already they are in love, getting married in absolutely no time.     However, this is still recommended for adults if you want a want 103 minutes of a \\"cute\\" story and don't take any of it the least bit seriously as if anything in here could really happen.

B0028K3192|3.0|Honestly, this album is soooo over rated. I was excited for the big return of Maxwell just like everyone else. I mean the guy was gone for eight years without releasing any new music, and when he left he was on top of the world (yes very similar to what D'Angelo did except he is still taking his sweet time with his comeback), so yeah everyone was excited for this album. But once i saw the extremely short track listing , i already knew i was going to be disappointed. After a eight year wait, i was expecting a little more than a nine song album, one of the songs being a really lame 2:44 long instrumental. Maxwell is still no doubt a talented R&B singer, but Black seemed like he didnt really put his all into it. Because in the end, this album has three good songs. One being the sugary sweet smash single \\"Pretty Wings\\", where Max sounds amazing vocally over this amazing heartfelt ballad about heartbreak. And than on \\"Love You\\", he shows his mid tempo side with a great song about just being in love. But again, its Maxwell's vocals that steal the show on this track. And then \\"Bad Habits\\" is another great mid tempo groove... but then the rest of the album is mediocre at best. I dont understand how so many people can say this album is that good, when you don't even get fifteen minutes worth of good music. And what makes it so disappointing is the fact that i had to wait eight years for this album, even though its more like an EP. Like i said though, im not taking anything away from the man's talent, because he is easily one of the more creative R&B singers out right now. And Black isnt terrible, its ok, its just i wanted more music after such a long wait. But im willing to bet you that he is gonna win at least one grammy for this album, most likely for \\"Pretty Wings\\", because thats the song that this album is built around. And its Maxwell's biggest single since \\"Lifetime\\" in 2001, the single peaked at number 33 on the billboard hot 100, and the album debuted at number 1 onthe top 200 chart, so it was definitely a big comeback for Mr. Maxwell. But was it truly worth the wait though???... definitely not in my opinion. Now its time to see what D'Angelo is gonna do for his comeback??? BLACKsummer'snight = OK.              Grade:  C

031606792X|4.0|THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE (as much as possible) AND FOR THOSE DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO READ IT    This is my first Amazon review because I didn't think either side was very impartial in their assessments. I guess it's true that people either loved it or hated it.  So I offer what those before me seem to lack - an impartial analysis as best as I can give it.  This reviews Breaking Dawn but also the whole saga as the \\"problems\\" with Breaking Dawn are evident in many of her books.      First off I will address the writing itself.  Meyers writing style in all the Saga is wordy and 'loose'.  Not in a moralistic way but just that she takes 30 pages (for instance) to write something that could be said in 5.  It's why her books have relatively straight forward stories but are still 500-800 pages long.  On the other hand, what's so special about concise writing - you could argue that her style sets atmosphere, tone, and character development.  Even her critics - or people expecting to hate the series - seem to get sucked into turning each page.  One 1-star reviewer said she read the whole series in a weekend.  Over 2000 pages!!  I'm sorry, but if it was a truly terrible series I could not continue to devote a weekend to it.  So something kept the 1 star reviewer going.  That said, were I her editor, I would hand back some of the more egregious sections and tell her to tighten them up.  In Breaking Dawn that would be Book 2 - Jacob.  It just went on and on, long after we got the point.    On the heels of that I would add that my biggest and first complaint as a reader was the beginning.  There I feel she didn't take ENOUGH time.  I would happily slice off 100 pages from book 2 and donate them to book 1.  The wedding was rushed, the honeymoon was unsatisfying.  In my opinion.  Which is a critical statement.    The problem with the popularity of this book is that everyone imagined their own happy ending and then got mad at Meyers for daring to have a conflicting one.  It isclear, perfectly clear, that this is the end Meyers had in mind all along. The arcs, the foreshadows, the back history are all present.  I dare say most of the ire over this ending is not based on the ending at all but on the fact that the book didn't go where that one fan wanted it to go.  A large cross section of \\"you can't please all the people\\".  In fairness to those fans though, the tone and theme did markedly and abruptly change.  It was an adult book following three very teen novels.  Bella grew up and a semblance of reality was introduced.  Suddenly it wasn't teen fantasy.  It wasn't hormones, ogling, prom and millionaires.  The fantasy of vampires and immortality hangs in the wish that we would never have to grow up.  That one goes from being a pimply awkward teen to a beautiful fantastic millionaire in the space of a 'kiss'.  I have yet to see the vampire story where the vamp is a newborn and penniless living in a ghetto.  They are always several hundred to thousands of years old and consequently wealthy or they are sired by a wealthy vamp and thus skip any reality-inducing transition.    Most criticism is based around the adult direction this novel then took.  They wanted to see more romping by Edward and Bella.  Maybe with specific scenes in mind (college? hanging at the Cullens? backpacking through Europe).  Something romantic and just outside our existence enough we could vicariously live it and just inside our existence enough that we feel we could have it to, if only.  If only we met our true love, if only we found the family we would want to hang with, if only we could take an extended vacation and buy that European ticket.  But for one small, but POSSIBLE request, we could be there too.    Instead Meyers takes Bella into a world of adult choices and consequences.  No romping, no drawn out fairy tale wedding.  No fairy tale honeymoon.  Again, as the editor, I would have scrapped the honeymoon and had it re-written.  They argued.  There was negativetension.  For a book built on romance they cannot argue on the honeymoon.  Not only that but Edward didn't believe Bella's explanations and then withdrew emotionally. He made a decision and then carried it out unilaterally without her feelings. This is not a good romance, and arguably is not a good marriage.  Many plot points come from the honeymoon, but if I lampooned her for anything it would be this section.  She needed to find a different way to get there.    As for remarks from reviewers that it was \\"too easy\\" and there was no suffering, those comments are laughable.  Again the same flaw as before.  Meyers characters did not suffer the way some of her audience wanted or expected.  And suffered terribly in other ways.  But those other ways 'don't count' and suddenly it was too easy and there was no sacrifice.  Not true.    As with any book some lines I would cut, some characters could use a little more attention, some characters a little less.  Examples would be to be a little less obsessed with Jacob (trim book two) and flesh out Rosalie more.  She became more of a major character but stayed two dimensional.  Not good.  Alice disappeared and it wasn't until deeply in that a cursory reason was offered.  Edward reverted to being a little too two dimensional himself, practically repeating the same lines over and over. While the story supported it to an extent I would have asked her to dig deeper.  His actions made sense enough for the story she wanted to tell, but with a little soul-searching and digging around she might have transformed past the story she did tell and find one that would resonate more deeply with more fans.  Edward needed to be more present as a true character.    Her story is a 2 person romance at its core - but in book 4 she shed the romance early on and then relegated Edward to an auto-pilot version of himself.  No wonder a huge chunk is told from Jacobs point of view!    There were plot points that I didn't like either (yes, the imprinting issue was a major one) but it was her story to tell, not mine.  So while I would not have gone in that direction I am also not a best selling author.  But that particular plot line seems to have universal UNappeal.  Truthfully the whole imprinting concept is a bad one.  For a country that loves freedom as much as ours, the concept that you see someone and become their slave regardless of any choice or free will is rather repugnant to me.  True love celebrates freedom.  Meyers loved introducing Jacob as a REINFORCEMENT to Bella's love for Edward.  Bella wasn't settling, she had fine options, she CHOOSE Edward and all that entails.  So sad werewolves never get such joy for themselves.  They don't find true love, but a happy sort of enslavement with creepy undertones at that.  (Imprinting with children? Surely imprinting should ONLY work between adults.)  This is not a tangant so much as an unfortunate offshoot of Meyers - in telling her fantasy and perhaps flexing her own fantasies - she unwittingly made werewolves the worst kind of culture.  In addition to the aforementioned imprinting woes there was also the abuse theme that unfortunately ran too rampant for my tastes.  I felt that Eclipse was entirely too close to a sexual attack between Jacob and Bella.  Quite simply he used his superior size and strength to force Bella into sexual acts (just kissing but still) that she was not consenting too.  But throughout the book he forces Bella into many things she does not consent to - through force or emotional blackmail.  She tries to dress it up as his being young or hormonal.  So rather than it being a character flaw of Jacob, he can remain flawless by pretending it is a character flaw of all men?  That is, quite frankly, a terrible statement. I prefer to believe it is just a character flaw of Jacobs and one that continues to an extent in book 4.  Jacob demands his way.  I do not find that a friendship, a love interest, or in any way romantic or desirable.  It is a temper tantrum and no more.  Which paints werewolves as juvenile or valueless.  Which is a shame.  Meyers, so caught up in the way she regarded it, failed to see this for how it really read or could reasonably be read.  A reviewer or editor should have pointed it out.    People found the end battle to be anti-climatic.  This is a matter of opinion to a large degree, but it's fair to say that there was a showdown, there just wasn't a huge explosion, metaphorically speaking.  The ending was far more intellectual than it was a mindless action movie.  More readers wanted the mindless thrill of hunt, destruction and victory.  But if they were to re-read the end without preconceived notions then they would find that a lot is going on.  Having said that I must address that the ending, climax aside, had some plot holes.  Since I'm I'm trying to avoid spoilers, suffice to say that you can't look too closely at the ending or it begins to unravel some.  Again a failure of the editor or reviewer to catch this prior to release.    To sum up this review: Meyers tells her story.  If it was the first book, like Twilight, when no one knows what to expect, then it would have received a far different review.  More popular?  Who can say.  But certainly different.  As the Fourth book of a beloved series people had secret desires and expectations for these characters.  The main ire comes from the fact that Meyers told her story instead of the one they secretly demanded.  Enter this book with an open mind, let Meyers tell you her story and you have a better chance of enjoying this installment.    There are some minor plot holes and times you might want to slap a character.  This is as true for this book as any other probably.  It runs fast in some areas, and long in others.  As do all her novels.    Lastly, this book is more adult.  Less fantasy and more How Their Lives End.   Like it or not, the story is supported; it makes sense.  It is the way she planned to end the tale.  If it's not to your liking, there's always fanfic or your own imagination.

Tyler has no use for material objects, but has as much distain for the touchy feely, microwave sensativity alter-exisistance of our protagonist. Tyler beleives in living in the moment, which requires shedding of all attachments, physical and mental. \\"It is only when you have lost everything,\\" he says, \\"that you are free to do anything\\"<br /><br />How does one get here? The two start an underground, secret fight club, where other young men with similar plights can go and box, with total abandon. Eventually, this grows,  to the edge of sanity. Soon, boxing is found to be only a means to an end--stripping ones self down to primal instincts and being truely alive. Between bouts, Tyler starts a fling with Marla.<br /><br />But even fighting and worrier simplicity is not enough; the fight club decides to spread the gospel, and devise a plan to blow up several financial institutions, wiping out credit records and thus the whole base of materialistic capitalism, which, fight club members would say, binds us all into emotional sleep  in pursuit of $300 neckties and Dolche Gabana armpit razors.<br /><br />Fair enough, but anarchy  was not what our narrator intended--all the guy was really trying to do was get some sleep--and he sets out to stop Tyler from executing his  master plan.<br /><br />Only one problem: Tyler does not exist.<br /><br />This raises one of several major points in the film. Our hero did not feel he could make such big changes on his own, and sets up an alter-ego, which is really his ideal self--all the things he aspires to be and can't. This sounds insane, but to a degree,  we all have a fantasy about doing what we want when we want, saying what crosses our mind, and being free from the demons-material, social, and psycological- that stop us from being ourselves. Usually, we see our ideal selves as another person, devorced from us.<br /><br />Now, if we believe our heros version of events, he has gone quite mad, but on another level his madness is genius. We all have this internal process. He just externalized it, and probably came closer to getting free form his chains then most of us will. Where does personal liberation end and anarchy begin? Good question, and isn't it the fear of stepping over the line that  stop most of us from finding out. Which is scarrier--staying how we are or wading into the forbidden zone? I don't know.<br /><br />Fight Club  makes more keen social comments. When our hereo begins to let go of his yuppie lifestyle and begins his 12-step programs, he is only trading one costume for another. The film is as critical of the 'lets cry and find our power animal' psudo-psychology that has infested out culture as it is the crass materialism it replaces. It is like the alcoholic who goes to AA, and this replaces the liqour as the base for his or her identity.<br /><br />The violence in Fight Club is really not violence as we think of it. Everyone fighting wants to be there, and the intent of the fighting is collective liberation, not to do harm toanother. It is a means to an end: with other characters, the boxing could have been pottery or fly fishing. So it is difficult to be upset by this \\"violence\\" when you consider its unique roll in the story.<br /><br />Two other points about violence stand out: First, the one time he takes  a fight to far and disfigures a fellow member, it is at a point in the film where he is about to go over the edge; a turning point.<br /><br />Second, yes, empty skyscrapers are blown up at the end of Fight Club. But remember, this was two years before September 11th. We knew in the back of our minds a large scale terrorist attack was possible, but our biggest focus in 1999 was how much the NASDAQ went up each day; this was a very different time. America was partying. No one knew the unthinkable would happen soon, so you really can't say, retroactively, that the destruction in the film was in bad taste.<br /><br />Regardless, Fight Club is a funny, entertaining, thought provoking film, its points much more nuanced than the title and fight scenes indicate.ly fishing.

1416550534|5.0|What a fantastic book!  I absolutely loved it and did not want it to end, even as I couldn't wait to find out the secret from the past.  Morton is a wonderful writer.  I'm only sorry she's only written two books -- I adored THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN, too -- and that I'll have to wait so long for another of her stories.  As an author myself, I was particularly fascinated with the way Morton wrote strictly from Grace's point of view, yet managed to make us feel as if we knew what Hannah and, to a lesser extent, Emmeline, were both thinking and feeling.  An extraordinary debut.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B001GKJ2E8|4.0|The beginning of Wanted plays out a lot like a scene from [[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]], with a dangerous-looking man in a suit tracking down the source of a special bullet. What ensues is an over-the-top special-effects laden battle in which said man launches himself out of a skyscraper to engage snipers on an adjacent building and manages to kill them all, only to himself be taken out by a sniper's bullet in glorious and disgusting 3-D. Then we're back to a narrative by office drone Wesley Gibson's (James McAvoy), prone to panic attacks and harangued by his overweight boss. Warning: this review contains mild spoilers.<br /><br />It's easy to make the parallels between The Matrix and Wanted, given the opening scene, but it's the second scene in the office that really gives the film its heart. This is [[ASIN:B0007DFJ0G Fight Club]] by way of [[ASIN:B00005JLWN Equilibrium]], amping up the fisticuffs in the former with the gunplay of the latter.<br /><br />Gibson suffers frequent panic attacks and medicates himself heavily in an effort to cope with the insults of everyday life: the stupid job, the unfaithful girlfriend, the backstabbing coworker. He is destined for something better, something that involves the sexiest mentor a man could ask for: a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie). Jolie looks a little too gaunt here, but she hasn't lost her aura of dangerous cool and she uses it in spades to bring poor Gibson into his own as an assassin.<br /><br />Gibson is, in fact, a member of a secret society known as The Fraternity, who in turn are descended from a medieval order dedicated to interpreting God's will via a loom - that's right, a loom. After translating the threads into binary coded orders, The Fraternity kills people who might alter the world's destiny for the worse.<br /><br />Once Gibson transitions from office worker to gun-fu martial artist, complete with curving bullets and hyper-time senses, the movie really takes off: Gibson is out to kill Cross, the man who, Sloan (Morgan Freeman) tells him, killed his father.<br /><br />Unlike say, [[ASIN:B000FKO3WG The Transporter]] series, which started out semi-realistic and slowly devolved into action parody, Wanted grounds us in a completely altered reality from the start.  It makes some of the gun-ballet and insane acrobatics performed by the characters easier to swallow, in the same way we accepted Neo's superheroic feats in the Matrix.<br /><br />What's surprising is that Wanted is committed to its tale of revenge and betrayal, willing to sacrifice a potential franchise to tell a good story. It asks the question asked of all religions: how long before the speakers of God's will begin twisting it to their own ends? And what is God's will anyway? Heavy stuff, considering the premise involves shooting lots and lots of people.<br /><br />Wanted is a surprisingly good action movie that transcends the bullet-time genre without seeming too derivative.

1416550542|5.0|The Forgotten Garden is a fabulous story, intelligently written, keeping the reader intrigued right up to the surprising ending. The author's first book, The House At Riverton, is also a great, well written, \\"can't put it down\\" novel. I highly recommend both books.
B001KVZ6ES|4.0|Clint Eastwoods' post production period on \\"Changeling\\" (2008) is when he apparently found the time to craft \\"Gran Torino\\". Only an institution as archaic and delusional as the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences could neglect this work of art during awards season, and like \\"Changeling\\", this too was shut out in all major categories (and sadly, even from the minor categories). What this says about the members' cinematic tastes one can only speculate upon, but chances are they haven't properly understood the depth and brilliance contained within this concise motion picture.<br /><br />As one reviewer aptly stated, this film is not about the car (1972 was a good year for Ford), but the car does come to represent the very essence of the lead character. He plays a mean-spirited old man who is racist, conservative, rude and anti-social, but at the heart of it he seems to be the very opposite of all these things. The film casts him as the sole white resident of an increasingly ethnically diverse lower-income neighborhood, and his attitudes (as vintage as his car) seem to reflect a dying America that seems unable to cope with the diversity brought about by immigration.<br /><br />The film also pays homage to the Hmong people, a true group of Eastern people who were displaced early on, and who have found pockets of solace within America. Even within Eastern societies, this particular group of people have been looked upon as overly conservative and traditional, a fact that the film lovingly pays tribute to, without hitting you over the head with it. Many mainstream publications seem to indicate that this film is about tackling racism and overcoming color lines. Well, that is but part of it, and in many ways not even. Race becomes a very secondary issue here, and by the end of the film you find yourself unable to find the issue relevant at all.<br /><br />Ultimately, the story is about a widower who finds he has no purpose in life, but he also has a difficult past, having been in the military at one point. There are thousands of such veterans all over the world, and this could be their story. Whats incredible is that even though most of our lives are far removed from the lead characters', you will find yourself empathizing with the character, and his racist attitudes seem almost humorous (it also seems that he is less racist than he is territorial).<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is not a thriller or a fast-paced action film as its' misleading cover might indicate. Hardly. There are a few scenes of violence and one unnerving segment featuring a female lead (a great acting job by Eastwood here), but other than that, this is largely dialog driven. Its' most affecting segments come when Eastwood tries to integrate with his Eastern neighbors - largely humorous, but you'll find yourself relating to these scenes in ways you hadn't imagined. The standout performance is by the young lad who plays Thao, who plays the second lead - its an innocent, camera-friendly performance that relies more on fortitude than actual acting, but he does a commendable job.<br /><br />This is also clearly not a film for everybody. Some may find it heavy-handed and unbelievable, but the end of the film is so moving and apt, that it should get to the most jaded viewer. Prime bits of trivia also litter the films sets, and more educated audiences will have fun trying to pick up on them. For the record, this also marks the debut of Clint Eastwoods' youngest child, a 21 year old actor. Try to find out where he features - its one of the standouts of the entire film for many reasons.<br /><br />Four and a Half Stars. A beautiful work of cinema, and testament to the fact that Clint gets better with age.ry at one point. There are thousands of such veterans all over the world, and this could be their story.

B0020MKTOS|3.0|This movie missed a golden opportunity to educate the american people of the great sacrifice of the Hmong people and the ongoing genocide of these people for their fierce fighting along side of our troops in Viet Nam.
B001VEJ2G2|5.0|This is one of the more surprising records of the year. Indeed, after all the hype that had been poured over her especially in the NME, the worst was to expect. Also her persona with the hair and the clothes made one expect the worst. But it is an excellent example of electro-pop with a very strong 80's influence. This will be another excellent example of some of the best music this year coming from female performers after teh brilliant debut by Ladyhawke. This one is more pop and more easy to listen to but I prefer Ladyhawke's from an artistic point of view. Also the cover image is quite a disaster but as I wrote the music is great.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|This performance is a treasure from beginning to end.  Loreena's music crosses times and cultures and transports the listener.  Her skill is showcased here, and she easily flits between instruments - the harp, the piano and the accordion, as if she had been born playing all of them.  It is so nice to see a real soprano singer like her who actually has the creativity and skill to write and play her own music.  This gives to the songs a feeling of authenticity and emotion.  Here is a singer who has lived through joys and sincere pains, especially the tragic loss of her Fiance' and you can hear those exeriences in her songs.  This is no superficial fluff.    Loreena has no backup singers in this performance.  Her voice carries through effortlessly, and the audience is periodically rewarded with one of her captivating smiles.  Indeed, there are several places where she and her band are so obviously enjoying the music that you can see smiles on many of the faces.      And this is where her band deserves more mention.  These people are true musicians and their talent is so pronounced that it would be hard to select one to stand out for special recognition.  The violinist, cellist, and hurdy-gurdy players are exceptional.  The diversity of instruments used makes this a culturally enriching evening.    Buy this and enjoy it over and over, with or without the commentary.  And get one for the favorite musician in your life, who is certain to appreciate the range of instruments and the skill and dedication of those playing them.
B00007KQA3|4.0|I love this movie and I own it on VHS and DVD. However, some of the VHS movie has been edited out of the DVD.  For example, the scene where Winston and Julia go to O'Brian and want to join the resistance is ommited.  This is an important scene, one minute Winston is reading the Goldstein book and the next scene they are being arrested by the thought police. I wonder if they will issue a DVD with all of the Omitted scenes back in.  Otherwise, a great movie.
0060557818|3.0|Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere accomplishes two great things:  a fantasy world that though you only get 369 pages to enjoy, stretches beyond your wildest imagination without borders.  It's a universe that Gaiman could write VOLUMES about and barely scratch the surface.  Every twist and turn makes you think twice about things you've always taken at face value (\\"Mind the Gap!\\").  In this world, names of streets, locations or events are literally what they are.  Down Street goes... well, down.  \\"Mind the Gap\\" is an order to, well, Mind the Gap - or else!      The downside with this infinite universe however is that it makes it very hard I imagine for an author to weave cohesion into a story.  Gaiman seems to find himself creatively identifying new streets, locations, etc with every word, and rarely is able to peice it all together giving each of those glimpses some sort of unity.  Toward the end of the book I found myself no longer savoring the details or trying to imagine what they must look like, and instead skim-reading to get to the action, which is unfortunate because it's so good!    The second thing Gaiman does here is create characters that you just don't want to stop following.  Whether a main character that you get to watch grow and develop, or a small side character that appears for just a few pages, you're entranced and wanting to know more about them.      The downside is, like with the worldy descriptions you might sometimes wonder why he introduced that character and if their appearance meant something symbolic that you just can't get your head around.  I found myself analyzing certain characters, that I could vividly picture thanks to Gaiman's detailed descriptions, wondering - what does this really mean?  Who are they?!  Where will they show up next?  When they said that to that other character, what did it infer?  Typically characters just happen in a novel and are somewhat face-value, but Gaiman has created an atmosphere with this book that makes your mindrun on full steam and because of that, I think the reader might become side-lined and fall down rabbit holes of their own.
B00004YZT5|5.0|Just like the Motley CD with John Corabi, this is the BEST and most \\"legitimate\\" Poison effort in a CD. Richie Kotzen injected such a bluesy feel finally with some decent lyrical content and just a cool vibe. Pick it up if you're a Poison or Bret Michaels fan - it is worth it. When the 80's hair bands were all flash and no substance, some CDs contained some decent legit material.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|This is one great CD!! I can't tell you how many times I have listened to it. There is not one bad song on here!! There are times when they hit the strong guitar that I just want to punch something!!!!!!!
B001QB9H10|4.0|\\"3\\" seems like it may have been a bit rushed.  However, the action sequences zoom @ hyper-speed.  Jason Statham isn't much different as Frank Martin than he is in the other films he's done.  But there is a touch of the sentimental, even as he looks great in an expensive suit.  Francois Berleand again plays French inspector Tarconi.  He brings wit and comic relief.  Natalya Rudakova was a hairdresser in New York when director Luc Besson spotted her, got her acting lessons and cast her as Valentina, an Ukrainian girl who is kidnapped while on holiday.  Jeroen Krabbe who had been in \\"The Fugitive\\" plays her father Leonid Vasilev, the head of the Ukrainian Environmental Protection Agency.  Putting the screws to him is Johnson played by Robert Knepper who played T-Bag on TV's \\"Prison Break.\\"  As a bad guy, he brings a sweaty intensity to the role.  David Atrakehi has an impressive cameo as the other driver Malcom Manville who literally becomes unglued.  Luc Besson who directed \\"The Fifth Element\\" also wrote the screenplay.  While there were snippets of dialogue I had trouble deciphering because the soundtrack was mixed so high, I enjoyed this as a good action romp.  Enjoy!
B001PPGAIK|1.0|Honestly? I gave up on this movie after about one hour. I get that it's more of a tale than a story, so I mostly forgave the no-depth characters, the \\"Disney\\" feel to the frontier experience. Nicole Kidman's new face has about two expressions, and none of them convince here. Hugh Jackamn oes what he can, and rather well, but frankly he must have felt awfully alone here.   And then, there's the visual side of it. We expect great things from Luhrmann, visually. After all, he has a vivid style and knoww how to use technical stuff in a seamless way. In here... heck, the FX feel like the dino run in King Kong. They're ugly, and snap you right out of the movie.   So I gave up on the movie. My wife didn't. And then told me she should have.
B00003CXCD|5.0|\\"Roman Holiday\\" still captures attention and fully carries viewers frame by frame to its bittersweet conclusion.  While Audrey Hepburn had done some European films prior to this, the credits still claim \\"introducting Audrey Hepburn.\\"  She won the Oscar for her first Hollywood movie, no small feat considering she faced Leslie Caron in \\"Lily,\\" \\"Ava Gardner\\" in \\"Mogambo\\" & Debra Kerr in \\"From Here to Eternity.\\"  As Princess Anne, she is uncomfortably proper & delightfully rebellious.  Hepburn had grace and charm that translated well on screen.  Opposite her as the leading man was Gregory Peck who won an Oscar for \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"  As struggling newspaperman Joe Bradley, Peck exudes his own calmness and kindness as he comically tries to put the sleeping stranger to bed.  Both Eddie Albert as the photographer Irving and director William Wyler had Oscar nominations for the film.  Blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo wrote the screenplay using friends to mask his authorship which won an Oscar.  Margaret Rawlings as the attending Countess Vereberg and Hartley Power as the newspaper boss Mr. Hennessey also have excellent supporting roles.  The 50+ year old film exudes a sweetness from its era.  The DVD extras inform that this was one of the first films to be shot on location.  It takes us to a time in Rome where motor scooters and bicycles were more prominent than automobiles.  This special collectors' edition packages the film in handsome style.  Enjoy!

B000002A3T|5.0|This album (cd) is a masterpiece. But, you have to look beyond the normal  debates to see and hear the truth. This collection of songs is always   mistakenly thought to be about Roger Waters. Although a couple of lines might in fact be about David and Rogers falling out, anyone who has suffered through a relationship with someone who is a narcissist and has a personality disorder knows these words ring clear and true. David was in the process of divorcing his wife, the mother of his children. He masterfully penned his feelings of despair and elation, triumph and tragedy. Listen again with new ears and understand, this is the very finest 'divorce' album ever written. The song 'Take it back' is obviously about his then girlfriend and future wife, Polly Samson. 'Coming Back To Life' and 'A Great Day For Freedom' are stories of rebirth after being strangled in an abusive relationship. By the way, David Gilmour is one of the greatest writer/singer/guitarist/musician's who has ever lived. Just listen.

B0026WNGBA|2.0|I do think the author has a valid message. Too many runners run without enough attention to their form. Unfortunately the book is overflowing with self-reported testimonials litered throughout. The constant repetition of what the author perceives to be core messages will insult your intelligence. It caused me great pain to try to avoid skipping entire pages for fear of missing an important message. The author is trying to sell way too hard, which makes for an unpleasurable reading experience. It left me with an aftertaste of having read an infomercial for a DVD, website and training courses. My recommendation to the autor: read Steven King's &#34;On writing&#34;. The current form of writing must be be limiting the success of this book -preventing it from realizing its true potential. I cannot recommend it.
1400063736|3.0|It took me a long time to get into this book. Then it grabbed me for awhile, but ultimately I was disappointed by an ending that didn't really tie everything together. This book is more a series of short stories that the author tries to tie together, not completely succesfully. At times, the language is brilliant and heartbreaking. But at other times, it is clumsy and awkward. I loved parts of this book, but at times I just had to force myself to keep reading it.

B0001VV1GK|3.0|I like plan toys products- usually good quality, simple, wooden toys.   In this one, the package makes it look like all the accessories are included. Once I opened the box I was surprised that there weren't any cars or the helicopter or street signs included.  I ordered the set of 3 cars and transporter seperately afterwards.     It took me about 25 min to put together and I was disappointed that it didnt come with more cars for the price.    My only other complaint is that the \\"gas station\\" part is so far under the 1st garage level (its the base for the garage above it) that it is hard for little hands to get the cars in to the gas station part.  The car wash is just a free standing little thing whereas other garages its really like a tunnel or a real car wash.  I think the garage/ramp part and elevator are good but I don't think the gas station/car wash are very easy/fun to use.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|The 4 discs in this box collection are permeated with great pop and psychedelic hits (and non-hits) from American bands in the mid and late sixties whose infatuation with UK bands from the First British Invasion is more than evident, especially The Yardbirds, Stones, and The Who. The cuts are drenched with Farfisa organ, fuzz tone guitar, attitude vocals from lead singers emulating Mick Jagger, harmonica players taking their cue from Keith Relf or Brian Jones, and LOTS of tambourine (remember that instrument?). Some of these songs actually bugged me when they first came out (in particular, I thought at the time that Count 5's \\"Psychotic Reaction\\" was a blatant rip-off of \\"I'm A Man\\" by the Yardbirds [which it was], and being a \\"purist\\", I shunned it -- now its' psychedlic nostalgia has overcome those feelings and I like it on its own turf; likewise \\"Sit Down I Think I Love You\\" by the Mojo Men or \\"My World Fell Down\\" by Sagitarius were thought of as pure fluff, but now I can appreciate the production values and great vocals in such cuts).  This collection will grow on you like a bad rash under tight fitting bicycle shorts.  I have this in regular rotation on my CD player, and the accompanying booklet is fascinating -- some of these bands went on to tragic ends after their obligatory one hit wonder, while some of the band alumni went on to bigger and greater things.  Some of the novice players from these various groups were Todd Rundgren, Leslie West, Bruce Johnston, Ted Nugent, Emmitt Rhoades, Glenn Campbell, Captain Beefheart, and others whose greater days of fame lay ahead of them at the time these songs were first done.  While many of the reviewers on this work may quibble over what cuts should and shouldn't have been included in the collection (I do regret the notable absence of \\"96 Tears\\" by Question Mark and the Mysterians), if you have favorable recall or impressions of only 25-50% of the songs represented on any one of the 4 discs, and haven't heard of the other cuts, I guarantee that you will get into the whole package.  Many of these artists were regional chartmakers, only, and you wouldn't have heard them depending on where you were situated back in that time frame, but a common thread of musical philosophy runs through it all.  A masterful collection of a bygone musical era that will never be duplicated, when attitude and imagination were just as important if not more important than technical musical expertise.  The sound quality on each and every cut is outstanding, as well.  Get into it and drag that Nehru jacket and Lava Lite out of storage, and you won't regret it.
031236198X|5.0|I am very pleased with the book I purchased.  It was in very good condition. Seller true to their word. If you are working with others and change is in the making, this would be a good book to have them read.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|The magic of the first real rock opera, Tommy, is captured in Stereo and SACD Stereo as well as SACD Surround.  Audiophile and Home Theaters ring with an extraordinary remix by Pete Townsend of Tommy bringing a wonderful complete and full sound.  Extra material includes other takes of songs and songs not on the original album.  If your system is a good one and/or you are up to date for SACD this is certainly the CD version to get!  See Me, Feel Me, Touch Me, Heal Me!  And Enjoy!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|What a great flash for the money for an amateur enthusiast.  The bounce feature allows for much more natural skin tones for people, and color tones for objects. Also, faces are less shiny (oily) looking, so as to reduce or eliminate your post photo processing.    Next on the list is a flash bracket.
B0029LHWFO|4.0|This was a unique experience.  Reading Obama's words on the page and then hearing him daily on the news was like living in two worlds.  It felt like I was getting his most private insights at the same time I was listening to his most public proclamations.  And since the book covers the years from his early childhood to law school and a bit beyond, it unfolds  so much of his past, leaving me with much greater insight into who he is today.  I love that he wrote the book long before the presidency because it feels so real and genuine, truly his own voice, not a ghost writer.  It felt so intimate that it was actually weird to read the most private thoughts of the most public individual.  Did he have any inclination back then that he might one day be president?  I mean he writes about being an angry black man, about drinking and smoking pot, and losing his temper and being confused, about understanding race and hating much of what he sees.  It's all so raw, personal, exposed.  It shows the incredible journey he traveled, not just from middle class boy of a single mom to president, but of a person who for many years was not so confident or composed or articulate.  I think it's easy to assume today that he's always been the way we see him now, but that's really not so, and it's refreshing to see that he had to overcome a lot of internal obstacles to see a clear path to follow.  That he needed to make peace with his father's absence, his African roots.  He needed to dig into his Indonesian years and his early years with his grandparents and his mother who gave him so much strength and support but who also pursued her own interests, sometimes on the other side of the world.    In addition to a compelling story, it's just so well written.  Sentence after sentence struck me: interesting language, images, sentence variety and flow.  A few examples--\\"At certain points the potholes yawned across the road's entire width\\" or  \\"For Sale signs cropped up like dandelions under the summer sun.\\"  So much fun to read good writing!
1401923119|5.0|I'm a yoga practitioner and yoga says that mind is superior to body. So we should be able to control our body with our thoughts but science has traditionally said DNA controls everything. I'm so happy I've been to relate thoughts from yoga based way of life and biology. Yoga way of life I got from Sunil Sheoran's [[ASIN:0981192106 Mylife Framework: A Model For A Successful Life Based On The Yoga Principles]] and thoughts on biology from this book. This book will break many established beliefs of science and again will prove that there are lot of things that are still not resolved by traditional science. I'd suggest both these books, if you want to have answers for all or most of the questions on life. Of course, not everyone is intellectual and open minded enough to grasp the powerful thoughts presented in these books.
0345495004|4.0|Despite looking at a lot of Frank Lloyd Wright's work in various house books, I knew little  of his personal life other than the fact that his ideas were different and ahead of the times.  This work of historical fiction focuses on Wright's relationship with his mistress of 7 years (and former client), Mamah Borthwick Cheney.  What a story and what a scandal they were!  Though she ultimately got a divorce from her husband (Wright didn't until many years later), they made headlines for years.  The Chicago papers at that time (roughly 1907 - 1914) reminded me of the current National Enquirer, filled with yellow journalism.  Mamah essentially left her husband and children to live and travel with Wright and to pursue her own career interests, mainly translating the work of Ellen Keys, an early pioneer in the `Woman Movement'.  Mamah and Wright were truly soul mates and sacrificed many obligations and reputations to remain together, both abandoning kind and supportive spouses who made them feel 'suffocated'.  I found myself oscillating back and forth between empathy and anger toward Mamah.  On the one hand, she had the courage to forge out on her own at a time in America when women had few rights or choices, but on the other hand, she simply walked out on her children, leaving her husband and sister to raise them and to explain their mother's abandonment.  Ultimately she does begin to reconnect with them, but who knows if she could ever have been a real mother to them.  This is a fascinating story that pulled me into their world, and now I have a much keener interest in Wright's work, especially Taliesin, Midway Gardens, and The Imperial Hotel in Japan, all of which come to life in the book.
0307408833|5.0|I thought trying to eat healthier that I would have to give up baking. But this book has tons of healthier recipes that are delicious! I love to bake and love this book. This is not a normal book and does require a lot of new ingredients, so it does take a little money, but so worth it!
0143057812|3.0|This is a very captivating story. It's well structured and I had little reason to ignore it sitting on the table next to the bed. Now, that said, several times during the read and again at the very end I felt somewhat disappointed regarding the experience. Why?<br /><br />I'll preface my comments with this caveat: English is my native language, but it was never my best subject in school. A fact. In fact, had I not lived in another country for over a decade working with the results of translated English, I doubt I'd be able to make these comments. Which are,<br /><br />The translation did not live up to the promise of the writing. In fact the translation detracts from the enjoyment of the story. It dumbs down with cliche. It digs potholes in the smooth running scripted events. Many of the chosen phrases and descriptions simply startled me when they appeared and the more I read, the more I was sure(as I can be) that the author was not saying \\"that\\" but something more elegant or pointed or less trivial.<br /><br />Still it was a good story. 5 stars for the story, 3 for the read.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|bought these at my local gamestop...these things rule!! triggers feel like they should, actually brings back the old feel that we are used to...no slippage, and great for racing and shooters...where r2 tends to get used alot!...but yeah..i definately recommend these they are well worth it!
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Truly a stunning album. One of the most amazing pieces of music I have heard for many years.    Florence Welch has a voice that she uses to amazing effect. It reminds me alternately of some other outstanding female vocalists, such as Grace Slick, Sonja Kristina (Curved Air), Sinead O'Connor, Dido but somehow seems to transcend all of them.    There is an intimacy and warmth she projects, combined with a great power, yet at times projects and air of frailty and vulnerability.    The music itself is pop of the highest quality, and the at-times sparse mixes move seamlessly between driving rhythms and allusive, haunting and captivating airiness.    The way that instruments such as harp are highlighted and allowed to interact with, and emphasize Florence's voice is wonderful.    The lyrics repay careful listening, being very much out of the ordinary.    Standout track of this album is Rabbit Heart (Lift It Up), but any of these songs would, to my mind, be outstanding among the very best music ever recorded.    I entitled this review \\"The Best Album of 2009 (So Far)\\", but I would not be at all surprised if I didn't hear a better album than this for several years. Truly, truly a gem.
B001TH16DI|3.0|If you expect to a great quality Blu Ray movies you will be disappointed, but you can't beat the great price of about $75 that's about $12.50 per movie plus a bonus disk.  So it's a must have for any Star Trek fan.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This collection has so many good songs by Stevie Wonder that I almost don't know where to start.  Even some of the ones that I thought I didn't know of sounded familiar once I heard them again.  The nice thing about an album like this is that it brings back so many memories.  Where were you when Fingertips Part 2 first came out?  Or Superstition?  Or For Once in My Life?  The song Overjoyed always reminds me of the beach and of summer, maybe because of the reference to castles and that background sound that's kind of like water.  It makes me think of building sand castles, hence water and the beach.<br /><br />I Just Called to Say I Love You reminds me of a time when I had been doing too much traveling for work and heard it while driving in the rental car up in B.C. and thought of my husband back at home.  Signed, Sealed and Delivered reminds me of a fun party and all the friends that were there, some that I don't see often enough anymore.  It's funny how each of the songs brings back another time and place.  I guess that's why I like collections of music by artists that I enjoy.  This one will not diappoint.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|The Gran Torino with Clint Eastwood should be given the best director, actor, screenplay.  This was the best movie Clint Eastwood has done in a long time.  It is definitely superior above all those other nominees in 2008.
B001SO69IY|2.0|I had been waiting for this album for years, so I pre-ordered it and was excited as hell when I received it, only to be hugely disappointed. All of the funk and memorable beats of the first album are gone. The production isn't as bad as on \\"Tical 0\\", but somehow more generic. Erick Sermon and Mathemathics didn't have anywhere near as much involvement on this album as they did on the first, and it shows. None of the new producers has a decent track on the album.    Even most of the lyrics aren't up to par. Redman and Method Man are still good, but half of the songs are generic club tracks and it shows in the theme of the songs. You won't find anything like Cereal Killer on this one. Ghostface, Erick Sermon and Keith Murray give solid contributions, but they can't save the album from the generic, shoddy production and lame, forgettable beats. Hopefully they bring back the funk on \\"Blackout! 3\\", like Method Man did with \\"4:21 - The Day After\\", because \\"Blackout! 2\\" was a big disappointment.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This series looks amazing on Blu-ray, and the David Attenborough commentary is, in my opinion, ten-fold better than Sigourney Weaver's. If you have ever seen one of these episodes on the Discovery Channel or BBC and thought \\"Wow\\", you should absolutely add this to your collection.
0156027321|5.0|Wow! I just loved this amazing story! It was such a good book! Martels words evoked every emotion - from gripping, edge-of-the-seat excitement, to out loud giggles, and even to tears. It was simply a riveting story - I adored it! And while I initially thought that the quote on the front of the book (\\"It's difficult to stop reading when the pages run out.\\") to be a rather silly way to phrase something, but now that I have finished the book, I must admit - I completely agree... I did not want the story to end at all.  I loved this book! Books rarely live up to their hype, and this one exceeds it!
B00005N6KG|4.0|Plays well for the money, but still does not compare with my old  MDR-A34.
0143034901|4.0|Is a gothic novel set in 20th-century Barcelona the equivalent of a fish out of water?  Apparently not, as Carlos Ruiz Zafon proves that \\"old school\\" genres CAN be taught new tricks (dogs need not apply) in this potboiler that practically turns the pages for you.  To sum up the novel is this side of impossible(and you can read up on it in the Publisher's Review anyway), so I'll just say that the book has a little bit of everything, from romance to murder to mystery, from comedy to tragedy to bathos.<br /><br />Look (at yourself as a reader) before you leap, however.  Are you a fan of books by Hugo?  Dumas?  Dickens?  Do you mind words and lots of them?  Impossible plot twists?  Plots begetting subplots begetting sub-subplots?  If you're still with me here, I think it's safe to assume that you will love this book.  Is it excessive at times?  Of course.  But that's the nature of the beast, and the reader not only forgives it, he expects it.  Leave your inner cynic at the door, then, and you should enjoy an old-fashioned \\"read\\" as removed to Spain at the time of the Civil and World Wars.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Sissy Spacek won a well deserved Oscar nomination as Best Actress for her portrayal as a shy teenager with powers of telekinesis who is harrassed by her classmates in \\"Carrie\\". This nomination is unheard of as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences rarely acknowledges performances in horror films. \\"Carrie\\" is based on the splendid Stephen King novel and also stars John Travolta in one of his first films. Piper Laurie gives a blood chilling performance as Carrie's mother, a Bible -thumping woman who demands her daughter live a celibate and isolated life.<br /> The DVD is beautiful and comes with a collectible booklet featuring info on the film. Also included is a featurette featuring interviews with Spacek and others, an animated photo gallery, theatrical trailer, and an interview with director Brian DePalma. French and english subtitles are included with a running time of 1 hour and 38 minutes.<br /> \\"Carrie\\" spawned a sequel in 1999 called \\"Carrie 2\\" and a remake of the film was adapted for television on NBC in 2002.
0307346617|1.0|I was really excited to read this book, after reading all the glowing reviews and all the hoopla. And I could not have been more disappointed. The concept--a series of interviews with survivors of a worldwide zombie attack--was an intriguing one. But the execution, I thought, was just awful. The voices of those being interviewed all sounded the same, and particularly the Americans' dialogue was absolutely cringe-worthy. Stereotypical Texans swearing every three seconds, moneymakers revelling in their own greed and revealing their sinister plots like a bunch of goofy Bond villains--clumsy attempts to parody and criticize American pop culture and our culture of consumption--yuck. All handled so baldly, so obviously, with such a heavy hand, that I actually couldn't finish the book. And I can count on one hand the number of books I haven't finished in my life.     If you want to read a well-written, truly scathing critique of our culture and politics, read George Saunders. Skip this book unless you like being hit over the head repeatedly with a very broad, very crudely made board.
B0028K3192|4.0|Once again, another CD comes around that reminds us all what music is really supposed to be like!!  If you enjoyed any of Maxwell in the past, this one is sure not to disappoint.  Sick and tired of new age garbage & 15-22 year olds screaming and using autotune??  Here's some medicine for your headache!!  Not to mention, the brotha is on tour now I will b e taking my girl!!  Ticket prices are very reasonable and will be worth the expense, so get yours!!  Along with everyone else though, the only disappointment is in the 9 track playlist...  :(
B00000K3UU|5.0|Product was in excellent condition delivered on time very good seller. If needed I will defiantly purchase from him again
0345347951|5.0|This goes well beyond aliens, as is typical with Clarke. It delves into who we are as a race and where we are heading. This has been my favorite book since I was a young teen and I have reread it every 5-10 years since, each time with a deeper and more complex interpretation. I rarely reread books, but this is a new complex ride each time.
075640407X|5.0|This is an awesome book for anyone who even has a little bit of liking for fantasy books. It is written expertly, and keeps you wanting to read more and more. I couldn't put it down. I am definitly waiting now for days 2 and 3 to come out. You almost forget you are reading a book because of the excellent descriptions Mr. Rothfuss provides. Overall, every fantasy reader should have this on his bookshelf.
0440418569|5.0|How can you (Pullman) make me fall in love with these wonderful children, just to have them pulled apart. To create a love so beautiful and then make it go hungry is just cruel!     PS. I love this series
0765356147|4.0|The \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\" are the first Brandon Sanderson novels I've read.  I found the concept of creating magic through the use of various metals was unique and fascinating.  I enjoyed all three of the Mistborn novels and plan to purchase more Sanderson's soon.
0792164903|5.0|Although it doesn't follow The Legend of Sleepy Hollow hardly at all, this movie rocks! Of course, a Burton/Depp combination is almost guaranteed to be enjoyable. It has some head turning moments, but still manages to maintain the lightheartedness of Edward Scissorhands and the bubblyness that Johnny Depp is best known for. Christina Ricci comes out of her Casper shell and does a great job playing royalty.<br /><br />I gotta say, Johnny Depp is an amazing actor. He's one of the very few actors in today's world that can fit into literally any role. Christian Bale is following closely in his exclusive footsteps, as is Edward Norton. That's not really related, but I never pass up an opportunity to praise the three ;)
B000F6IOC0|4.0|The great special effects in this DVD make for some very entertaining viewing. The costumes are LA OK. Vampire and werewolf (lycans) special effects...make up for some of the costumes.     Tony Curran, as Marcus, delivered a formidable performance, and so did Derick Jacobi, as the father of all vampires. The action sequences are very fine...making up for the rudimentary plot. This is very entertaining in a high action vampire/werewolf kind of way.
B000OPOAM0|5.0|A surprisngly great Start to Terminator  group of movies. A must have to have to any collection especially those who like an early look at what our Future could be like . Plenty of action and well acted  and just  well done. Really the best of three although all were well done increasing  in  the 2nd  3rd ones  with  more Digital action. This one before that Digital stuff  has it's place and is terrific.
1554072840|3.0|This book is all right.  The part I do like is that it shows the poop in the potty, unlike the other books we have.  But the potty looks like a drink pitcher which was confusing to my 2 year old daughter.  She kept pointing at it and saying \\"water\\".  I explained it is a potty but it took her a little while to accept it b/c her potty looks totally different.  Also, I feel that some of the pages are too wordy.  I prefer short and simple.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|I truly enjoyed the final book of the Trilogy.  My favorite aspects of John Scalzi's writing is the unexpected twists and turns in every plot that allow the underdog to escape certain doom and the delightfully dry sense of humor of the characters.  A fun read!
B00005V9IK|5.0|This was sent in great condition just as promised and very quick on time as promised. Would use sell again thank you
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I love this CD that i preview on Youtube and i decided that i have to have it because seeing all this street singers perform the way they did was amazing, besides I love different types of music and reggae its one of them.  I recommend this CD without doubt! You will enjoy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000WS4QJG|5.0|While the foundation of Michael's superstar solo career was laid with \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\" was the true launching point of it!     After making a strong debut with the \\"OTW\\" album, Michael (along with producer Quincy Jones) set out to make another hit with the album \\"Thriller.\\" Little did either man know that it would be the mega-hit that would launch one of the most spectacular (and admittedly controversal) careers ever in the history of popular music.    On the album itself, the first song I ever heard was actually \\"Beat It\\" and then \\"Billie Jean\\" and then \\"Thriller\\"! The song that made me a fan though was \\"Human Nature.\\" An underrated slow jam that has been sampled many times over the years, particularly by the female singing trio SWV for their song \\"Right Here\\" during the New Jack Swing era of the late 80's and early 90's.     To be honest, of the original tracks, only \\"Lady In My Life\\" was the weakest and even that one wasn't a dud. Its certainly better than a lot of music we hear today!    As I said, it gets five stars for the original material. I've never heard the alternate versions/bonus stuff so I can't rate them. I would recommend this and \\"Off The Wall\\" personally. While he has good music throughout the years, those two albums (to me) are his strongest.
1416550534|5.0|This author has a gift for weaving together the humorous thoughts in an elderly lady's mind with the tale of years gone by.  I've ordered The Forgotten Garden to enjoy as well.
0385341008|5.0|In 1946, a glib London columnist receives a letter from a man in Guernsey Island that turns her life upside down.<br />The book is written entirely in letters revealing hardships faced during WW11, friendships forged, and interests developed.<br />It's difficult to write about loss with both a light touch, and accurately depicting the depth of feelings aroused by travesties. Yet these authors manage to reveal so much pain, without losing sight of the humanity surrounding the entirety of their story.<br />I loved this book and didn't want it to end.
1595141715|5.0|This book is disturbingly difficult to put down.  It's not like readers don't know what's going to happen, and yet, somehow, nobody does.  It takes seven tapes to understand why Hannah Baker committed suicide and how thirteen people helped her get there.    Surprisingly, Asher's novel is not darkly depressing; Hannah is engaging, sincere, and at times, even funny.  What this book IS, is a narrative that will make you think--think about things you've said and done to others and hopefully, just maybe, change the way you act toward individuals in the future.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|Great Movie revealing the world of bodybuilding. In the 25th Anniversary Edition, the \\"extras\\" provide a more indepth look to the making of the movie, especially the interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger, where he reveals some of the \\"acting\\" done to make the movie more enticing. Many of the stars in this movie are old-school body builders, who have gone on to other things (i.e. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbu). Good job with the 25th Anniversary Edition!

0307278255|2.0|Lahiri deals with the same themes in the same ways too often.  Within the first page of each story, you'll discover what an intelligent Bengali you're going to read about, for all the characters in all the stories attend Ivy League or if not, prestigious east coast colleges.<br />Yet while she is able to create believable characters quite readily, they are all either melancholic, completely self absorbed, or irresponsible.  Abandonment, or fear thereof, permeates every story.<br />There wasn't one story where I either felt an emotional connection to or cared about the protagonist.  Reading this book was a completely unsatisfying experience.

B000WGWQG8|2.0|For God sake's -- read the book!    Because apparently the screenwriters didn't. They had John Adams not accomplishing things that he did, and accomplishing things he didn't. Instead of a great figure of American history, he is mostly portrayed as a spoiled, egotistical, indecisive, paranoid brat who sulks if he doesn't get his own way. His son-in-law is portrayed as uncaring about his wife when the opposite was true. The producers even had them married on the wrong continent and pretended Adams opposed the marriage. His alcoholic son blames his father for leaving him alone when, in fact, the son accompanied his father and mother to England and the continent for most of the son's early years.     They have Adams firing a musket and helping out in a sea battle with a British man-o-war that never happened. They have him not obtaining a loan of $10 million from the Netherlands that he actually did obtain. They often had him behaving the fool until being correctly steered by his wife, when, in fact, these two were one of the great love stories of our history and a husband and wife team of politically astute equals all couples should emulate. They had him signing into law the Alien and Sedition Acts that he opposed, but never related that he mostly ignored the Acts and let people who could have been prosecuted under the acts remain free. The list goes on. Sigh!    The man wasn't perfect and made mistakes, some of which were whoppers. He should never have kept on most of Washington's cabinet as they worked against him. And his insistence that Washington be called \\"His Excellency\\" was almost a farce and probably lost him Washington's trust. You owe it to John Adams and yourself to check out the Wikipedia site on this series to see what was true about the series and what wasn't    I watched the DVDs once and now I am selling it.
1416914307|5.0|This book came highly reccommended & now I am reccommending it to you.  MY teen daughter loved this whole series & I really enjoyed it too.  for those of you who read & enjoyed the Stephanie Meyer books \\"Twilight\\" you will love this series too.

6305907145|4.0|A young poor relation, Fanny Price goes to live with her rich relatives Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram, and their four children Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia. From the day she arrives they treat her like she's nothing. The only person who treats her well is Edmond. The rest of her cousins are totally messed up. Tom, the eldest is a train wreck about to happen and he gambles too much; Julia and Maria are spoiled rotten and conceited. When the father, Sir Bertam leaves for a couple years to take care of his plantation in Antigua, all hell, literally breaks loose. In comes the Wolves in sheeps clothing Henry Crawford and his sister Mary Crawford. Edmund is enchanted with Mary Crawford, she is fashionable and by all appearances seems 'good' but is unsure of her true character. Henry Crawford is nothing but a player. He plays with the hearts of both Maria and Julia, then later on goes after Fanny! Fanny of course is smart and can see through him. Her heart is for someone else....<br />When her uncle forces her to marry Henry Crawford because he is rich and she refuses, she is sent home. Going from luxury to poverty makes her sad, but when she is there, Henry 'bothers' her again, and in the movie she gives in and says yes, she will marry him and then rejects him-which makes him do something stupid but predictable. Nevertheless the movie ends up good when Fanny lands the man of her dreams.<br />The book by Jane Austen is very different. In the movie, Fanny is a writer with a wild imagination. In the book, Fanny is very softspoken and very much a lady. When Henry Crawford does something 'stupid' to attempt to ruin their family, there was no reason. Which I liked. In real life some people have no reason for doing horrible things, they just do. In the movie, they gave a reason.(Fanny deciding not to marry him after she said she would)<br />So, all in all it was very entertaining. The only things that I did not like was Fanny getting weak and agreeing to marry Henry Crawford and making her character a 'wild' woman. Read the book for the true version of Mansfield Park. It's much better.character a 'wild' woman. Read the book for the true version of Mansfield Park. It's much better.
0385737424|5.0|There seems to be an overabundance of books with vampires and magic these days so it is very refreshing to read something different.  And different in a very good way.  It's a mystery who is leaving Miranda strange notes and how this person knows things about her that no one could know.  But there are other things she needs to figure out too.  Like why the new kid punches Sal, why Sal stops talking to her, and why she doesn't like Julia.    Rebecca Stead deals with the usual angst of adolescence with a good hold on reality with characters that felt like they could be the kids next door.  She seems to remember what it felt like to be twelve, except I don't remember being so deep as to think that    \\"Sometimes you never feel meaner than the moment you stop being mean.  it's like how turning on a light makes you realize how dark the room had gotten.\\"    But I could relate to Miranda's love of \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" and her struggle to figure out where she fits in with friends and enemies and how things can change.  I can't say more without giving away more of the story, which I would hate to do because it was such a satisfying read.  All I can say is, things are not always as they seem.
1439138311|5.0|I was riveted from the first page, despite the fact that the plot has almost no twists and turns. (I've always thought a convoluted plot is the mark of a less accomplished writer anyway.) Every detail about Eilis' life, both in Ireland and in Brooklyn, drew me further into her story. I just had to know how this retiring, yet surprisingly poised young woman would develop in her new environment. And that subtle change drives the novel, right up to the point when Eilis must make some crucial decisions about her future. I hope to get my book club to read this novel, so I can have the pleasure of discussing it. I know there will be differing opinions about the ending.

It was different and new and there wasn't really anything else quite like it. The ladies of Wisteria Lane were always involved in some sort of intrigue or hijinks that was always entertaining. If you've watched it lately and didn't quite see what the big deal is, maybe you should take a look at the first season. Then you'll understand.

B001XJEKGC|5.0|I heard Hendrix's first album described as 'an embarassment of riches' and I think that fits too. The use of a term directed at Hendrix is fully appropriate here as there are as many songs written by him as by Clapton and there are songs off three of his albums. The Buddy Miles song (off 'Band of gypsies') was worked up days before he died and acts as a tribute, Eric has done 'Little Wing' for years, but the real jewel is when they tackle 'Voodoo Chile' - the long one, not the 'slight return'. Eric describes it as stepping off a cliff, and so it is. Steve Winwood, of course, played on the original 'Electric Ladyland' version. I doubt if there are many who could have pulled this off, but they did.    Other highlights include tke solo pieces (Eric on just acoustic guitar for 'Rambling On My Mind' and Steve just on organ for Georgia), the three J J Cale songs and the finishing Duo of 'Dear Mr Fantasy' and 'Cocaine'. There are four Traffic songs ('Glad', of 'John Barleycorn' is another goody), all of the first side of the Blind faith album (stand out, if there is one since they are all good, being 'Presence of the Lord') plus 'Sleeping in the Ground' which Blind Faith used to play live and is on the 'Crossroads' compilation. There are also a few from other parts of Eric's career (including 'Crossroads' on the bonus disk) but strangely few of his compilations.    Altogether, first class rock music, definitely five stars.

0312370849|1.0|When I first saw the book cover, I thought it was odd that it reminded me of the cover for \\"Those Who Saved Us\\".  Upon closer look, I realized that the two covers were similar in that they both had children in it.  Coincidence? How about the format?  The chapters alternate between 1942 and 2002.  Yet another coincidence.  Then there's the topic.  The Holocaust...  it seems to be a topic that is very lucrative.  Does Tatiana de Rosnay even have any kind of Jewish heritage?  She writes in the back of the book that she stumbled upon the Vel D'Hiv by browsing the Internet.  Is that how writers tackle a potential subject?  They browse the Internet?  If true, it would be a bit unfortunate.  If anything, I would expect writers to have a real bond to their subject.  Seems as if Ms. de Rosnay read \\"Those Who Saved Us,\\" decided that she should write with the same format, then surfed the Net for possible Holocaust stories.
B00005NB8K|4.0|I first saw this movie in my high school film studies class.  It blew my mind.    The Doors were one of the biggest acts of the late '60s and early '70s.  Val Kilmer is brilliant as Jim Morrison.  He's got the look, the sound, and the feel down pat.  Jim was a bit of a wild man during this psychedelic era, and the movie totally reflects that -- excessive drugs, wild antics on and off stage, etc.  One of my favorite scenes is when The Doors are invited to play on The Ed Sullivan Show and are asked to censor \\"Light My Fire.\\"  They don't, and Val exaggerates the moment way beyond what actually happened.  A classic scene.      There are a few inaccuracies in the film which knocks my rating down one star.  I learned about them in Ray Manzarek's book, \\"Light My Fire:  My Life With The Doors.\\"  Apparently, Jim Morrison did graduate UCLA; he did not quit, as shown in this movie.    Still, as exaggerated as some parts are, that's what good filmmaking is all about.  Buckle up for a wild journey through time with The Doors.  Is everybody in?
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|Hollywood could only dream of making a movie like this ever again. 30,000 extras is un heard of these days. It would all be computer and what not. This is a biblical epic but you don't have to believe to love this movie. I am Christian and loved how accurate this movie portrayed the early Christians in Rome. Of course we know that Nero was a nut who burnt his own city down. But this movie is so much more than that. The acting is phenomenal and the sight of ancient Rome being so perfectly built so many years ago should make hollywood envy this movie. If you love movies of ancient Rome as i do this is a must for you. And the Blu Ray is fantastic.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I had never seen \\"Metropolis\\" before although I have seen many silent films. I looked around for what looked like the best version, the Kino had the best reviews and I think they did an amazing job, the film is very clear and the speed looks fine, this is particularly important for this film where the visual impact is overwhelming from the opening credits when a series of lines create the word Metropolis, and the viewer is directly confronted with the machine world, powerful and frightening, yet beautifully depicted.<br /><br />The musical score is an additional plus. This edition has the original music by Gottfried Huppertz, which is effective and interesting music, and as excellent complement to the film as one could want.<br />The viewer should be aware that since this copy was made there have been several original films re-discovered: One at the Museum of Cinema in Buenos Aires, another in Chile and a third in New Zeland, so a full length version with all the missing scenes is to be expected in the near future.<br /><br />When we see the main \\"Heart machine\\" through the protagonist's eyes, we perceive its inherent evil by its transformation into the monstruous ancient god Moloch, devouring in its furnace-mouth the worker-slaves. This vision sequence is one of the best in the film and one of the best in the history of cinema. The extremely complex process required for the subtle transformation is explained in the extra section of the DVD where there are a lot of other useful details on the costume designs, biography of the artists involved, making of the film and interviews with the director himself, many years later, all of which I also recommend watching to fully comprehend the film within the context of the period.<br /><br />The story line is a typical love story:  Freder Fredersen (Gustav Frohlich) is the son of Joh Fredersen (Alfred Able), who rules over the great megacity of Metropolis. Freder, like all happy aristocrats in many ages,  is surprised to discover his lifestyle has been built on the backbreaking exploitation of a largely invisible working class (thankfully for the visuals, very attractive men make up most of the groupings)  who constantly tend to the machines that make the city work. He discovers the subterranean levels of Metropolis in an effort to understand these lives, but is driven to it by the infatuation with a mysterious and radiantly beautiful woman, Maria (Brigitte Helm) who makes an unexpected apparition at his Club (actually aptly named Club of the Sons, Eternal Gardens) surrounded by a group of the worker's children  while she is showing them the garden of the club.<br />Though the scene is cut short by the Master of Ceremonies of the club and his attendants who clearly find such an intrusion inappropriate-The closeups between Freder and Maria at this point are extraordinary in their expressivity, a whole passion is growing in seconds and the poetry of her perfectly lit face, particularly her eyes in this scene is a highlight of the film and reminiscent of the visual impact of a Garbo closeup. Interestingly while reading the notes, I found out that this great actress of the silent cinema retired only a few years later when she married a German industrialist, and in Pre-Garbo fashion never again appeared or discussed her life in films or interviews to the end of her very long life.<br /><br />When Freder rushes to see his father we catch a glimpse of that great city, still imposing and futuristic today after so many hundreds of skyscrapers have been built, everywhere in the world. And for us that have lived here in New York for so long that the skyscraper skyline is the most familiar urban landscape, it is obvious that the inspiration for his gargantuan city came to Lang when he visited here in 1924. It is hard to understand from today's perspective, but when the movie was completed, and certainly at the time of that voyage,  neither the Chrysler (which particularly resembles the central tower of Metropolis) or the Empire Estate existed, they came years later in 1930-31, the Woolworth building in downtown Manhattan, which was completed in 1913 was the world's tallest structure till 40 Wall street was constructed, ahead of the Chrysler,  also in 1930. But since 1908 all the tallest structures of the world were located here, as one replaced the other through the years,  and the massive construction, particularly around the financial district, had already given New York a 'Babylonian' look as the city of towers reaching for the stars. In his uniquely perceptive and prophetic way, Lang was already dreaming up the city that developed in the future, but that would already be realized to architectonic perfection in his great film.<br /><br />The hero's father is a powerful and detached executive, whose every facial expression beams out elegant self agrandizement, as well as the peculiarl expression that comes with absolute power, is worried by both Freder's unnatural interests and Maria's potentially subversive activities among the workers. He makes this discovery through the intelligence of evil scientist: Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge a great actor who portrays this villain to perfection within the contrast of Maria's purity and Freder's innocence.<br /><br />Rotwang shows him the entire scene of Maria haranguing the workers from a tunnel in his house that is conveniently connected to the catacombs where they meet. She is telling them the story of the Tower of Babel, another sequence of film that is absolutely riveting in its recreation and manipulation of the huge crowds in the construction, who resemble in their enslavement, the citizens of Metropolis and is actually an allegory for their  coming rebellion. More importantly, she is prophesying to them of a \\"Mediator\\" who will come to \\"make things better\\" . Rotwang actually hates Joh Fredersen because he took away his love, an idealized beauty named Hel that appears in the scene in the shape of a marble bust,uncanningly similar to Maria in looks. Fredersen married Hel, but she died giving birth to the young Fredersen. He  also has created a robot, an extraordinary creation that can be 'better than man' and he agrees to give it the likeness of Maria in order to destroy both Freder's love for the girl and her own revolutionary activities. But Rotwang has a hidden plan of his own: once the Maria-robot has been unleashed, he will use her to destroy Metropolis and thereby take revenge on Joh Fredersen, though things do not turn out quite as he expects, of course. The transformation sequence of the robot however,  is one of the most successful and visually fascinating parts in the movie, and marks it as one of the all time masterpieces of science fiction.<br /><br />The movie is not only high art and entertaining, but it manages to retain a level of modernity and relevance to contemporary social issues that is still, today, almost a century after its creation, simply baffling. There is a lot here that reminds the viewer of an earlier masterpiece by an American genius of the cinema, Griffith's \\"Intolerance\\". It is certainly on the same level of importance and quality as one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />The missing parts of the movie are explained with titles, and they basically relate to subplots, so I am relieved to think the most important and relevant part of the film is what has survived, though any cut it is to be regretted, given the high quality of the design, scenery and costumes of this movie, which are always perfect. However only last year(2008) a copy of the original film  was discovered at the Cinema Museum in Buenos Aires and is currently being restored by the rights holders of Metropolis, the F.W. Murnau Stiftung, which later confirmed that the newly discovered footage largely completes the missing footage, except for a single scene which was badly damaged due to being at a reel end. Although the new footage is reported to be in a \\"deplorable\\" condition they had begun restoration work on the rediscovered film this year and a new restored copy is to be expected in the near future, I for one  can not wait to see it, though I consider this existing version enough of a masterpiece to be viewed over and over again.
B0028T6XXY|1.0|The most shocking revelation in this extraordinarily disappointing release is that Michael smokes. This would explain the changes in his voice over the past couple of years.

1400063736|5.0|This is a wonderful discovery - a big, rich, ambitious new novel of obvious intelligence and (despite some very rough material) deep compassion. McCann's empathy for the diverse set of characters he channels is fairly astonishing - you don't get that sense of immediacy and intimacy without great commitment and, ultimately, a belief that redemption is possible even in the most desperate of worlds. That I think is the meaning of the high-wire act that the characters all witness and understand differently. It binds their stories together in ways they mostly cannot know, and also tells us that by keeping going even in the teeth of despair a hopeful outcome is possible. Over and over again we see them pressing on against killing odds, not even knowing why; but collectively their interlaced stories (thanks to the invisible hand of the writer, coaxing out surprising lines of connection and consequence--i.e., fashioning a plot from this seemingly disconnected material) culminate in a hard-won and deeply satisfying affirmation. The novel, unblinkingly realistic throughout, indeed ends on a well-earned high note.
B0000024IE|5.0|I bought Fear of a Black Planet when it first came out in 1990, and remember all the controversy over Chuck D's lyrics.  The music itself was ground-breaking, and for me, remains - even to this day - as one of the best albums ever, regardless of genre.  The album is quality from beginning to end, and reminds me of Nirvana's own ground-breaking Nevermind album.  Even in 2009, it is still good.
1401923119|5.0|Bruce Lipton, PhD, a cell biologist was a professor and researcher at the University of Wisconsin and had done stem cell research.  At that time in his life his career was going well but his life was in a shambles so he up and moved to the Bahamas and taught cell biology to Med. Students.  While there he observed the ecosystem and was away from the dogma of academia and he had an epiphany!  He saw the individual cells in our bodies not as individuals but as a community of 50 trillion cells working together in harmony!  He made the leap from individual cells to a community, to individual people and species coexisting on earth and the earth as a community of beings - alive!      He went on to shatter the old meme of Darwin's that said species were in competition with each other to a new frame of reference that all species needed each other.  Then he had a breakthrough realization that DNA did not control our lives, but the environment had a hand in our evolution so he postulates that what we think changes what we experience - just like what happens when an individual cell encounters a foreign environment - it thinks for itself and makes changes to survive and protect.     Where before Bruce wasn't really spiritual, he certainly is now.  I find the book interesting and enlightening.
B002A4Q652|5.0|If you are a fan of female fronted gothic/symphonic metal such as Nightwish or Within Temptation, you owe it to yourself to check out Delain. This is their second album and notably features Marco Hietala from Nightwish on two tracks. There are a few other guest musicians that I am unfamiliar with. Contrast this with their first album had many more genre-related guest musicians (Sharon den Adel from Nightwish, Liv Kristine from Leaves Eyes and more Marco Hietala) and as such was more diverse.     I am unsure how much of Charlotte's vocal performance on this album is the result of pure talent (e.g. Sharon den Adel) vs post processing (maybe 85%-15% respectively). I believe that the previous album was a little more raw, with crunchier guitars, less processed vocals and less keyboards. Regardless it a very enjoyable album that has seems significant play time on my MP3 player.

0755322819|3.0|`American Gods' by Neil Gaiman is a true page turner of surprising literary quality. Gaiman's not uncommon concept, that the gods of pre-monotheistic mythology are real and require worship to thrive.<br />The GK Chesterton inspired conversation with the Hippy Girl in San Francisco is amusing, and Gaiman's mythological gods fulfill Chesterton's maxim that \\"Oh, if these new pagans would only be old pagans, they would be a little wiser! The old pagans knew that mere naked Nature-worship must have a cruel side. They knew that the eye of Apollo can blast and blind.\\": With slight deviations like Eostre, Mammaji and Ganesha the deities are accurately portrayed as epic narcissists who devour humans (in a most unusual way in the case of Bilquis). All these fantasy elements-gods, goddesses, culture heroes are set in the real world of small town America with occasional visits to Las Vegas, Chicago and New York. Setting the book in the real world and mixing everyday life charges `American Gods' with a sense of immediacy that it would have lacked had it been set in a magical world. The visit by Shadow and Mr Wednesday to Czernborg and the Zoryas at their run down house in Chicago worked well and could have been repeated with deities from other pantheons, perhaps the Middle Eastern pantheon in Detroit, Aztec in Los Angeles, Asian in Honolulu or San Francisco and the Irish pantheon in Boston. Indeed the various mythological gods were more interesting than the anticlimactic battle between new gods and old. It would've been interesting to see more of the various gods and goddesses such as Ashoreth or Kubera who were only mentioned briefly. I found the Hinzelmann subplot intriguing and wish this had been expanded.<br />The revelation that America incompatible with the gods of mythology, was not well argued. Shadow and Laura were drawn in such a way as to be insufficiently interesting.<br />`American Gods' is nevertheless interesting and well worth a read.<br /><br />I took away a star for the books central revelation that America itself is hostile to all mythological deities. Of course this revelation is delivered by a deeply spiritual Native American culture hero, as if America were innately unspiritual. Gaiman gives no explanation as to why this might be the case, except to imply that a lack of fairies/veela/kobold/leprechauns is proof that America is inhospitable to mythological entities. He chooses America rather than Australia or New Zealand, two other countries that were also settled after the enlightenment. Perhaps the real explanation is a subtle anti Americanism rooted in old world jealousy.<br />I took away another star for the characters of Shadow and Laura who were both slightly insipid. Shadow's criminal past was especially irritating and it seemed as if Gaiman was trying to show solidarity with poor unfortunate criminals by making Shadow one of their number.<br />Despite these minor irritations, `American Gods' is still an excellent book and I highly recommend it.ntral revelation that America itself is hostile to all mythological deities.

I badly needed to hear more from this band so I duly purchased \\"Perfect Symmetry\\", not realising how very different it would be. So different, in fact, that it had me checking the band members on the \\"Hopes and Fears\\" album to make sure it was the same guys and not some other group with the same name!  Very unlikely I know but I was just so perplexed!      Well, of course, it was one and the same band. So I listened to the rest of the album, marveling at the total departure from the piano playing lyricism of their first work. LOTS more music in the compositions and Tom's voice in competition with it. It was interesting but just so different from what I identified with them before.    The following day I listened to it again. This time I was prepared for it and ended up intrigued.  Next day on I played it again and now I can say I love it.  Tom's beautiful voice still effortlessly soars.    Please do as I did and don't write it off on the first listen. It grows on you in an amazingly quick way.

B0029NY9YO|2.0|Yes, I'm a big fan of the Watchmen comic book, but I wasn't mad about passing it into a movie in the fisrt place (an HBO series would be another thing).  although the movie seems completely faithful to the comic book I think it's only in appearance. I think that the characters are not well directed. To much slow-mo, to much violence and gore (much more than in de Comic) and very little acting. It is like watching the comic move, but it feels flat. I get the impression that the actors are quite bored with their characters (the same impression I had with SW Episode I)  The relation of Sally and Laurie is not there, you also don't get the hate between Laurie and the comedian... or the right wing orientarion of Rorscharch, or the feeble figure of night-owl. You just don't feel it. The relations between the characters that is so well written in the comic book is not in the movie.  I hoped for the \\"dawn of the dead\\" Snyder instead of \\"300\\" one... shame, it looks like a very expensive video clip, not a thriller

1563894696|5.0|Batman hits graphic novels again with the long halloween, a deep, dark murder mystery hovering around a killer who Gothams newspapers have dubbed \\"Holiday\\", because he or she only kills on holidays, only one time has he let a person live, April Fools Day.  Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale do a great job of getting the characters right, the Joker is just as crazy as ever, so is Riddler, Solomon Grundy (born on a monday), Scarecrow, Catwoman, Two-face, and The Mad Hatter, as well as Gothams crime lords.  Loeb and Sale nail the tragic fall of \\"Apollo\\" Harvey Dent to the phsycotic Two-Face, making it more personal then any other graphic novel has ever done.  If you are looking for a graphic novel that has action and things blowing up on every page, you won`t find it here, this is a murder-mystery, but that doesnt mean that there isn`t action, it has just the right mix of everything.  The only problem I have with this novel is that there isn`t enough dialogue on many pages, making this a fast read, but the art is done so well I`m willing to forgive it.  Overall I immensley enjoyed The Long Halloween, and any Batman fan or just a comic fan or can get into this.    \\"Who...is......Holiday?\\"

Especially his early stuff with MMJ on Darla records.  Jim James said it best years ago, \\"we are the originators - they are the imitators.\\"  That's cool if you like My Morning Fleet Foxes.

B0026J8LHM|2.0|I'm sorry, I really want to give this a great review but any CD that makes me cringe I just can't do it. The last 2 songs, The best of times and the count of tuscany are the only songs that I can stomach. The best of times has one of the best guitar riffs that I have heard in a long time. I am soooo tired of the over the top Rudess keyboard jams. Towards the end of \\"A right of passage\\" he loses his mind and it really sounds awful. Keyboards are OK but for me I like the guitar they should have more prominence than the keyboards. The \\"growling\\" lyrics just sound stupid like towards the end in \\"A nightmare To Remember\\" You can see the huge dive in the quality of the lyrics when listening to their entire catalog on random. You go from a absolute masterpiece like \\"A change of seasons\\" to \\"A nightmare to remember\\" it makes you shake your head and wonder what the future holds. As stated in the lyrics, Wonderful Misery or Beautiful Agony. With lyrics like these, who knows.
B000OLGCHA|1.0|John Williams has composed 3 wonderful scores for the Harry Potter movies and Patrick Doyle did a quite good job as well.

B001TODCII|4.0|Liam Neeson is totally convincing as an action star. Give the man credit, he can act.

1439157383|3.0|Considering how 'mainstream' she is, I can hardly pick up a Jodi Picoult novel and expect classic literature. That said, I bought the book anyway because I plan to take my daughter to see the movie, and it's my general rule that we cannot see a film based on a book until we read that book. In addition, the plot appealed to my personal interest in biomedical ethics.    The characterization and pacing of the novel were ok for me. I found enough in both that I liked. The plot (and subplots) was engaging enough, and it was treated with adequate sensitivity. Unlike some, I found no problem following the alternating perspective from which each chapter was written. The obvious problem is the ending... wrapped up in less than a page, really. It in no way resolved the central conflict of the story, and I honestly felt short-changed. I spent hours enthusiastically moving from page to page to see how Anna or the family, informed by medicine and law, would resolve this issue, only to have the rug pulled in the final pages; I asked myself, when I closed the book, \\"What the hell was the point of all that?\\" Ms. Picoult really took a cheap way out, and she did a terrible disservice to one of her characters in the process (Anna). For that, I almost want to go down to 2-stars.    However, like I said, one probably ought not to expect grand literature from a mass-market author (think Danielle Steele with greater ambition and a different kind of social conscience), and I didn't and don't. My Sister's Keeper is what it is... a thoughtful author cashing in on the ethical issues and moral dilemmas of our times. I'm honestly glad Ms. Picoult is out there attempting to give authentic treatment to these issues. Unfortunately, in the case of this book, the ending sucks. But, you know, that's life. To risk sounding as trite as Picoult, we don't always get the endings or cut-and-dried answers we want.    So, 3 stars it is. Not godawfulburnitnowplease terrible; not ohmigoshgottareaditagainrightnow fabulous.

Some of the items are pretty complicated to make so I am only using about 1/4 of the recipes

Maxwell came back with the strong \\"Pretty Wings\\",a beautiful/heartbreaking ballad that deserves without a doubt grammy nominations next year.  but the cd is all good, there is no auto-tune,no songs about women as an object...it is the opposite, it is a gentleman album with songs about his life situations.  i am glad that are still a few r&b artists like him still making good songs, we need that. can't wait for the next cd.    favorites:    1 - Fistful of Tears  2 - Love You  3 - Stop the World  4 - Pretty Wings

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I did not expect much from this show.  A sci-fi/western cross?    I should have known better.  I was, after all, a religious 'Buffy the Vampire-Slayer' watcher.  All of the characters are good (even Jayne Cobb, admttedly my least-favorite character [sorry, Adam Baldwin]).  So, I bought the DVD and watched the shows, especially the ones I missed.  I enjoyed every one.    The, to my surprise (and horror), the show was cancelled.  It is sad to see that FOX is as stupid as all the other networks.  My guess is, Joss Whedon pushed the movie 'Serenity' (by the way, excellent movie) through primarily to show FOX what a stupid mistake they made by cancelling 'Firefly'.  Also, I suspect that 'Serenity' comprises what should have been the end of either the first or second season.    Back to my review.  Excellent DVD.  It combines the best of the sci-fi and western genres, as described by a master storyteller.  I better take a look at 'Dollhouse', to make sure I am not missing a bet there, too.

1933771690|5.0|I've just finished reading the book and there is still a lot I need to process. The comments I have read (not so much here but on other sites) have been, not surprisingly, mostly negative. Personally I do think Lanza is on to something important. Reading the many criticisms of his ideas, however, makes me aware that evaluating biocentrism is going to be very difficult because it is a proposal for a paradigm shift. By definition, a new paradigm always appears to be nonsense from within the established paradigm. A proposal to change from one paradigm to another is very different than a proposal to replace one idea with another within a paradigm. Most of biocentrism's critics, it seems to me, are treating it as if it's the latter rather than the former.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I read Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions but this is, I think, one of its most profound insights. For example,from the Ptolemaic perspective Copernicus and Galileo were crazy. Their critics and persecutors were not unreasonable. What Copernicus and Galileo were proposing, however, was a change in reason. As Kuhn shows, the shift from one paradigm to another is inevitably messy and chaotic. In the end, a new paradigm is finally adopted for very pragmatic reasons: it works, or at least works better than its predecessor.<br /><br />For this reason, I think there is a lot of misunderstanding of what Lanza is proposing. He is being critiqued from within the assumptions of the paradigm he is seeking to replace, which is understandable and even inevitable, but nonetheless very confusing. For example, traditional Christianity and modern science have debated whether God created the universe or whether it originated spontaneously in an event like the Big Bang. When Lanza says consciousness creates the universe he is not now offering a third alternative. Rather, he is proposing a model in which origins-in-time questions are meaningless.<br /><br />For Lanza, the universe is created and re-created in our consciousness every time we interact with it and this is its most important moment of creation. To many/most, such an observation will seem obvious and inconsequential. Lanza's assertion is that in practice this is much more significant a truth than we are aware. Ignoring the universe in our heads, he maintains, is leading scientists and others to numerous misunderstandings and on a whole assortment of fruitless quests (e.g. for a TOE/ \\"theory of everything or GUI/ \\"grand unified theory\\").<br /><br />In the long run, biocentrism will be judged on its utility. Lanza is certainly right in identifying the many problems that exist with our current model of reality, which are more profound and consequential than probably most people realize. It will take awhile to see if biocentrism is the replacement model that both addresses these problems and opens up new avenues for exploration and problem solving. In any case, I think Lanza has opened up a path that needs to be explored.<br /><br />Biocentrism is not overly long or technical and is well written, including several enjoyable and even moving passages from Lanza's own life. It will certainly make you think and see things from a different perspective, which I believe is always a good thing. Strongly recommended.consciousness every time we interact with it and this is its most important moment of creation. To many/most, such an observation will seem obvious and inconsequential.

006135323X|2.0|Dan Ariely, a behavioral economics professor at MIT, details his studies of irrational behaviors in this book.  Ariely runs vigorous studies and experiments drawing conclusions based on his findings over the years.  In many circumstances with particular stimuli, humans will in fact act irrationally; and this book delves into what those stimulants are and how predictably they can produce results in decision making.<br /><br />Ariely presents some very thought provoking studies in this book.  His tests and conclusions on relativity are fascinating; his look into procrastination is eye-opening.  Regrettably, the bulk of this book includes extremely limited experimental basis, contradicting conclusions, and mere restating of economic concepts presented as discovery.<br /><br />LIMITED EXPERIMENTAL BASIS<br />The bulk of the conclusions in this book are based on studies involving only students, leaving the conclusions severely lacking as they constitute results based on only one element of society.  The average student devoted to scholastics will make choices differently than one who is employed earring full time income; this aspect alone is enough to question the veracity of a study on students only, yet Ariely makes little mention of this possibilities of skewed results on this basis.<br /><br />CONTRADICTING CONCLUSIONS<br />In the chapter on supply and demand, Ariely notes that value is attributed to the perception of the difficulty to attain a particular object.  Illustrating his point he quotes Mark Twain; \\"In order to make a man covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.\\"  This point appears substantiated, until Ariely outlines his study on ownership and concludes that, \\"the general ownership of something increases its value in the owner's eyes.\\"  It is surprising that the direct contradiction of two studies and the conclusions was not obvious to Ariely, but what they suggest is that circumstances are the genuine stimulant in these cases, not the elements that Ariely would suggest.<br /><br />RESTATING KNOWN CONCEPTS<br />Ariely spent considerable effort outlining the non exactness of supply and demand and the psychological factors that permit other stimulants to affect pricing that are not based on supply and demand, suggesting that there are holes in common economic theories.  However, what he merely described is the thought processes behind price elasticity, a well known economic theory that includes these variants from straight line supply and demand models.  Ariely presents these findings as discovery yet they represent only a retread of known economic concepts.<br /><br />Ariely also spent a long discussion on Duke University students and their propensity to put more value on a basketball ticket they won versus a ticket they would have to purchase.  These studies led him to the conclusion that people value their own possessions more than those they merely desire to own.  Surely most students just getting by would not seek to spend $50,000 on a new car; yet how many students after winning a car in a lottery would be willing to sell it cheap?  Ariely again merely provides an example of marginal utility, another known economic concept.<br /><br />There may be elements of Ariely's conclusions that hold up in large scale environments; however, that his conclusions are so riddled with fallacy results in one being unable to ascertain the difference between what might be truth or just plain inaccurate.  I recommend passing on this work and reading authors such as Robert Cialdini for a more competent look into the psychology of irrational decision making.ely would suggest.

B0026J8LHM|4.0|Dream Theater fans could probably be split up into two groups: the headbanger/metal types, and the nerd/prog/musician types.  Personally, I'm more in the latter group, though I like a good \\"ball and chunk\\" track as much as anyone.  Since [[ASIN:B0000CDLA7 Train of Thought]], Dream Theater has been releasing albums that consist of 95% \\"ball and chunk\\" and 5% of the classic Dream Theater jams that I've grown to love.  While I've been dutifully buying each album (and DVD), I must say that they've fallen a few notches in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong - there's been an occasional gem in there, but they've started to loose the \\"memorable melody\\" and \\"sick jam\\" aspects that I loved.  It almost seems like Mr. Portnoy has taken over the band's musical direction a bit too much.  I can only take so many dark-metallic-songs about vampires, monsters, graveyards and death.  And I suspect that I'm not alone.<br /><br />So with the release of this album, I wasn't feeling too hopeful.  In fact, for the first time I didn't buy it on release day (or even release week).  Instead, one of my family members (who knows I'm a fan) bought the CD for themselves and lent it to me.  Let's just say that after giving it a full listen, I immediately went out and bought my own copy.<br /><br />This album is a welcome turn away from the endless bass drum and metal guitar tracks of [[ASIN:B000PFUAO6 Systematic Chaos]] and more toward the musicianship of [[ASIN:B000021XS0 Scenes from a Memory]].  It is no Scenes from a Memory, but it's a turn back in that direction.  And that's a good thing.  If you feel like I do about DT, or got into them back in the [[ASIN:B000002JPA Images and Words]]/[[ASIN:B000002JKA Awake]] days, then this album might redeem them for you.<br /><br />I hope DT never looses their \\"dark metal\\" edge, but I also hope they never loose their \\"beautiful proggy jam\\" edge either.  Unlike the last three albums, I think this album is a better balance of the two.  Notice, however, that Ididn't write \\"perfect balance of the two.\\"

All the southern accents are different and no one looks particuarly southern accept for the extras. The show is mainly about gay rights just remove the word gay and input vampire. It's a undercurrent message through the whole show. Not to judge the gays(vampires) they are people too that should have rights. If you like shows that ridicule Christians and white southern men and glorify slutty, empowered women you will love this show to pieces. For me, I love the blood, nudity and cursing.

0307473465|4.0|This is an excellent novel about Germany's shame; in particular the strain it has placed on a generation of children unable to respect their parents because of their participation or inaction during the Holocaust.  Much of the emotion in The Reader remains unexpressed, but always present, lurking beneath unspoken words.  The prose is spare and at times emotionally detached, yet the author manages to evoke strong feelings and to force the reader to reflect on the complex issues raised by the novel.<br /><br />The Reader is a `morally ambiguous' novel.  The characters are flawed and can not be easily categorized as clearly good or bad.  Hanna, the 30-something former SS Guard who seduces the 15 year old protagonist of the novel and who later stands trail for war crimes is guilty of many things but she has redeeming qualities as well.  When she asks the judge at the trial \\"\\"What would you have done?\\" she poses a question that haunts the post-war generation and the answer is more complicated than it might first appear.  The Reader does not absolve guilt or relieve shame, and efforts to seek atonement are acknowledged for what they are but are ultimately inadequate.<br /><br />I appreciated that this novel avoided sentimentality.  For a novel that, on its surface, appears emotionally flat, I found it surprisingly moving and thought provoking.  There are no easy answers in The Reader.  Horrible atrocities were committed that can not be forgiven but most of those who followed orders or who were passively compliant, weren't evil people; they were just flawed human beings who lacked the courage or resolve necessary to make different choices.  The narrator tells us that \\"Pointing at the guilty party did not free us from shame but at least it overcame the suffering we went through on account of it\\".  His own experience is complicated by his love of Hanna.  In a way it makes him party to the guilt of his parent's generation while at the same time leaving him with the shame of his own generation.<br /><br />The Reader is a short, engaging, and thought provoking novel that I found nearly impossible to put down.  The characters and their story are presented, warts and all, for the reader to consider, free of contrivances, emotional manipulation, and overwrought sentimentality.  This is an open and honest novel that I highly recommend. 4.5 stars.ation.    The Reader is a short, engaging, and thought provoking novel that I found nearly impossible to put down.

He is such a perfectionist that he won't compromise when it comes to his music. He tends to take his time, but always delivers the finest music, which touches our soul. This album, BLACK has more soulful punches to it compared to his previous albums while it still sustains the `sexiness' of his previous albums. His voice and instrumentation on this album is just sooo phenomenal.I hear people saying this album is too short, but I personally rather have a CD with 9 quality songs than a CD with 25 songs with so so quality:)    The DVD came with CD was so awesome, too. It was great to learn how each of his music on the album was born and created. For example, one of the songs, \\"Cold\\" started on a raining night. Maxwell was in the car and heard the sound of windshield wiper. He found it had weird rhythm to it, and decided to use the sound as a major code for the song. With the background information on the song, I was able to enjoy the song even more!!!     Please purchase Maxwell's new album, BLACKsummers'night. You won't regret it!!!

B001IF5YLQ|2.0|This DisplayPort to DVI adaptor does what it's made to do. That might seem like an endorsement given to a 5-star product, and you'd be right, if what the product did was essential or necessary. Unfortunately, this device (and it's exorbitant price tag!) only exist because of Apple's greed. I hate proprietary systems. They create problems like the need for an entire section of phone chargers because every phone has its own connector type! When technologies are new, this is unavoidable because the dog-fight between similarly functioning techs hasn't been won yet (think Blue Ray vs. HD DVD) and only once that battle is settled does standardization take place. That is the sort of thing that is frustrating (especially if you adopted the non-winning tech!) but understandable.<br /><br />What is not understandable and has no value to the consumer is when a company like Apple INVENTS a new proprietary system simply so they can sell overpriced accessories like this DisplayPort to DVI converter. What was wrong with the standard DVI connector on previous macbook pros, or for that matter, the original miniDVI to DVI connection on macbooks? Was the creation of this new connector motivated by a need or simply by greed? I'd argue that it's the latter, since Apple has frequently profiteered by selling worthless and unnecessary adapters for all their proprietary systems.<br /><br />Apple, you make fine computers and software, but this is the sort of loyalty killing treatment that ultimately is going to tarnish your golden reputation. If you want to create useless, redundant systems, go right ahead, but don't charge 100x the cost of the parts in your cable. Otherwise you'll prove yourself no better than Monster Cables selling HDMI cables at a 3000% markup.<br /><br />All that said, this cable will allow you to connect your 13 inch macbook pro to your DVI monitor. It will also gauge you in the process.

B0001CNRBG|5.0|This was such a nice movie!  I just loved it. Very funny. Cute ending!
B0028K3192|4.0|Maxwell is very talented and has once again put out some good music after his long hiatus. The album starts off with really strong with Bad habits, Cold, and Pretty Wings. The next two songs HELP SOMEBODY and STOP THE WORLD sort of remind me a some old Marvin Gaye songs (just not as good as his songs). They are not my favorites on the album but they are still decent songs. The last three songs are good and the album ends with the last track as an instrumental. Lyrically and the production of the album will not disappoint you at all. The only complaint i would have is that the album is too short. After 8 years i thought the album would have 12 songs at minimum. Other than that this is a very respectable effort by Maxwell.<br /><br />Stand out tracks:<br /><br />Bad Habits<br />Cold<br />Pretty Wings
B0028K3192|5.0|From opening cut, the horn peppered Jazzy groovy ballad \\"Bad habits\\", you know that the 8 year wait for the next Maxwell album has been worth the wait. \\"Blacksummer'snight\\" is Maxwell's long awaited follow up to his #1 album \\"Now\\".<br /><br />Following along the lines of the opening cut is the slightly more upbeat \\"Cold\\" with gently shuffling percussion and tight harmonies. \\"Pretty wings\\", the lead-off single is a pretty piano tinkled ballad with hand claps, yearning vocals and deeply sensitive lyrics about meeting the right girl at the wrong time. Other lovely ballads are \\"Stop the world\\", \\"Fistful of tears\\", and the lovely acoustic \\"Playing possum\\".<br /><br />Horns feature prominently on this album. \\"Help somebody\\" is an upbeat social conscious song Curtis Mayfield or Marvin Gaye could have done, with vocals alternating between lower register to falsetto with fluid ease. \\"Love you\\" is an organ driven upbeat Motown-sounding song with a tight wall of harmonies.  Closing the CD on an upbeat note is the groovy instrumental piece \\"Phoenix rise\\" with loads of horns, groovy bassline, and woozy effects. I have to mention, if you're expecting funky songs like \\"Ascension\\", \\"Everwanting\\" or  \\"Get to know ya\\", you may be disappointed as the sound is breezier and lighter this time around.<br /><br />My only complaint is that at 9 tracks, the album is a bit too brief, but every song is a sparkling gem. Well worth the wait! Now I'm eagerly awaiting D'Angelo's 9 year awaited CD.

B001VEJ2G2|4.0|La Roux are a UK electronic music duo with a fixation on 80s synth bands; Depeche Mode, Erasure and Yazoo to mention a few. Universally hailed by critics in the UK, at first I found their sound rather same-sounding and rather skeletal, but there is no denying the melodies and the songs grow on you.<br /><br />Opening cut \\"In for the kill\\" sets the tone for the CD; tinny sounding synths, a catchy melody, and Elly Jackson's (mostly) shrill upper range vocals. The song has already made #2 in their native UK. Similar is \\"Quicksand\\". The frenetic \\"Tigerlily\\" features swirling synths and a chilling spoken word interlude (highly remniscent of Vincent Price's from \\"Thriller\\"), while UK #1 single \\"Bulletproof\\" is bouncy electro-pop. \\"I'm not your toy\\" has an even more minimal sound than the other songs.<br /><br />Taking the tempo down a bit are \\"Colourless love\\", the Chinese music-tinted \\"Cover my eyes\\" featuring the London Community Gospel Choir (my absolute favourite, I can imagine Erasure doing this, it reminds me of \\"Ship of fools\\"), the gently pulsing \\"As if by magic\\", and \\"Armour love\\".<br /><br />I disagree with Amazon's comment regarding \\"the breadth of the album\\" and \\"La Roux's diversity\\" as every song sounds not to far off from the next, but still it's a good debut. A bit over-rated, but largely fun. 3 and a half stars really!
031606792X|1.0|I have never before in my life got finished reading a book (or the entire series for that matter) and wished that I hadn't wasted my time with it.  I didn't think I would read this series at first, but one of my friends gave me Twilight for my birthday so I figured what the heck, why not.  I was thinking that there must be something good there to generate that much hype.  How very wrong I was.      As several others have mentioned, the ending was so lame, I found myself thinking of better ways to re-write it.  The entire series builds up to this huge battle, and then Meyer doesn't deliver.  Someone needs to tell Meyer that most fiction is good because the readers can identify with it.  Well in the real world, not everybody gets a happy ending.  Just because Meyer is too cowardly to kill off a few key characters, the readers had to suffer through a boring \\"battle of words\\" instead of the epic battle we had been looking forward to.      There were so many plot holes and things that could have been better.  I've enumerated some of them below:    1) Renee never even attempts to come to Forks to see Bella when she is \\"sick\\", or even after she \\"gets better\\".  She just disappears from the story!  What mother, even one who hadn't seen her child in years, would not come to visit their child during or at least after she has recovered from a deathly illness?      2) What the heck happened to Leah???  After Jacob imprints on Renesmee, we never hear a peep out of her.  Meyer wasted our time developing her character, and then never tells us what happened to her.  Huh???    3) Aro's gift--wasn't it convenient that Bella found it right before she went out to meet Aro?  I thought there would be some significance to it, like it would reduce Bella's shield power when she put it on or something.  I thought Meyer could have done a lot more with that particular plot element.    4) Kate and Tanya just watched Caius rip their sister limb from limb right before their eyes.  Are you tellingme they are just going to let her murderer walk away?????    5) I thought something in the last book might make me like Edward over Jacob.  Instead, we continue with the endless descriptions of his \\"marble\\" lips and cold, hard body.  Give me a break.  Cold & calculating, Edward acts like Bella doesn't know what's best for herself, and lets his rival hug up on his woman whenever he gets a chance.  He is just not all that likable of a guy to me.      6) Even worse, Meyer casts Jacob in a completely different light during the last book.  He suddenly becomes a stock character like Edward--boring and pathetic.  Thanks a lot, Stephanie, now I'm not only disgusted by Edward, I'm disgusted by Jacob as well.     7) Bella didn't give a rip about being married.  Totally unrealistic.    This is how I had the ending playing out in my head:  Bella puts on the jewelry Aro gave her, not knowing that it will somehow reduce her shield powers.  The big battle with the Volturi actually happens.   Jacob, Esme, Carlisle, and Rosalie are assigned to protect Renesmee to give Bella time to figure out why her powers are not working.  Jane gets to Renesmee somehow and Rosalie, motherly vampire that she is, sacrifices herself to save Renesmee.  In a rage, Emmett kills everyone in his way, and then takes out Jane, but is so careless in his rage that he is subsequently killed by Aro.  At the last moment Bella realizes what is going on and yanks Aro's gift off.  Bella extends her shield to protect everyone.  She takes out Alec, and Edward takes out Demetri.  Tanya and Kate kill Caius and some others.   The wolves get their fair share of Marcus and the rest of the Volturi guards and witnesses.  Aro ends up surrendering in the end (either to Edward or due to some awesome stunt of Benjamin's - whose uber-cool power we never really got to see in the book).  Aro gets his authority taken away and is imprisoned by the Romanian vampires.  Leah's character should have been further developed throughout thelast book (she could have imprinted on Jacob, for instance, when she finally let go of Sam), so that Jacob is torn between Leah and Renesmee.  That way Jacob could end up screwing over Bella for just once, if he picked Leah instead of Renesmee.  (Sorry, Jacob's my boy, and it really just stinks that he ended up with a 5-year-old!!)    You have to admit that my ending is way cooler than the \\"Let's all be friends and live happily ever after even though it's totally unrealistic and lame.\\"
0452286751|2.0|Ayn Rand is not a great writer.<br /><br />Somebody said that Faulkner's first works were \\"about as good as anyone would expect.\\" He had a point. You cannot expect someone with no writing experience to produce great work. They must learn to do so in reference to other great writers and thinkers. Ayn Rand did not do this. She created objectivism instead. Objectivism, beyond all the words, is merely a blanket that protects people from criticism--\\"I don't have to listen to him because I have my own voice.\\" As a result, The Fountainhead comes to life as the work of a novice so thoroughly convinced in its brilliance.<br /><br />If you really want to know Ayn Rand, read her philosophical works. They're still a trap for cultists, but the portrayal of humanity will be less embarrassing.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|A fantastic show by two of rock's most talented, and well preserved legends (with honorable mention to Sir Paul and Mick, of course). Winwood shows that he is still the quadruple threat he always was (incredible vocals, keyboard, songwriting, and guitar) and for you Clapton fans - YOW - Eric, at this age right now, delivers some of his greatest solos ever caught on film (particularly that \\"Voodoo Chile\\"!) He has also developed, over the years, into a formidable blues singer. One of the keys to the magic of this particular show is that Clapton and Winwood chose each other's songs to play in the set list. How cool is that?
B0026OE2NY|5.0|Environmental reality is the real engine that dictates our future. This documentary makes a stunning contribution to the only point worth considering: simply that Earth is the only home we'll ever have. To continue on the path of environmental plunder is nothing short of insanity.
B0001L3LUE|3.0|\\"11 lessons\\" is a list documentary filmmaker Errol Morris came up with. These include:<br />1. Empathize with your enemy<br />2. Rationality will not save us<br />3. There's something beyond one's self<br />4. Maximize efficiency<br />5. Proportionality should be a guideline in war<br />6. Get the data<br />7. Belief and seeing are often both wrong<br />8. Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning<br />9. In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil<br />10. Never say never<br />11. You can't change human nature<br /><br />So one of \\"the best and brightest\\" didn't know this before waging war?! Oh my god. McNamara added 10 more \\"lessons\\" which are included in the DVD extras.<br /><br />The production quality is excellent. Errol Morris is a fine filmmaker. And I find watching a true war criminal sit there while answering questions, at times looking into the camera, an interesting experience. But I didn't learn anything from this portrait of an American Eichmann who is partly responsible for the deaths of countless millions. McNamara is way too easily let off the hook here folks. And what is more troubling is that viewers of \\"The Fog of War\\" are given the strong illusion they are seeing a clearer picture of history than they are. But how much do you know? Some reading in addition to the film would be useful. As an experiment, and I think for a clearer picture of McNamara, read journalist Alexander Cockburn's article on the CounterPunch website as supplemental material to the film. Please feel free to leave comments explaining to me why or how Cockburn is wrong and what is so useful about \\"The Fog of War\\". As for the title, Cockburn has an interesting explanation of the origins of this tired cliche. A truly educational doc on McNamara would have informed the viewer of much information included in Cockburn's \\"McNamara: From the Tokyo Firestorm to the World Bank\\". See for yourself. The snapshots of everything from McNamara's participation in WW2 under the psychotic LeMay and the firebombing of Tokyo, to his career at Ford and supposed effort to promote automobile safety, to his position as Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy and LBJ Administrations and ghastly role in slaughter of millions of Vietnamese and Americans is \\"foggy\\" at best. The film is supposedly about learning from war but his long tenor as head of the World Bank and the failed policies which he implemented are not covered. He smoothly transitioned from role as War manager to head of World Bank where he did much to aid Third World dictators and destroy the lives of peasants. McNamara lived to the ripe old age of 93 and never paid for his crimes.d supposed effort to promote automobile safety, to his position as Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy and LBJ Administrations and ghastly role in slaughter of millions of Vietnamese and Americans is \\"foggy\\" at best.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|This sitcom is consistently great--very funny.  Sheldon's character is by far the standout, but all characters are good.  They have developed over the course of the series very well.  I also like how some running gags are carried on over multiple episodes.  Highly recommended!
B00164KYV4|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent.  I wasn't expecting it to be all that great since the critics panned it.   I read the book and loved it.  I became a semi fan of Greg Bernhardt (?) even watched his short lived talk show.  The characters in this movie was dead on.   They were interesting, and the movie was engaging not boring.  My best couples was Gigi and Alex, but also Jennifer Anniston's character and Ben Affleck.  Marriage is an important part of most women's lives.  I never could quite understand why some guys can be content of going on for years and years without commiting to marriage.  What's the difference?  I think this movie kind of answered it for me.   When being pressured and pushed, guys will run....but as soon as they are able to relax about it; and get no resistance from their partner, all of a sudden marriage isn't such a bad thing.   Loved this movie...it was lighthearted and made me smile and felt good at the end.    For a nice pick me up, rent or buy this movie.
1565117700|4.0|This was a very brief but very engaging story wonderfully read by Gary Sinise. It is very touching and I didn't want it to end the way it did but I knew it had to. Great Story.
1402577923|5.0|A fantastic book that is easily listened to in its audio form. A review for this said that he spent too much time on the scientific details, but if you read Crichton, you know he gives the reader background on the science described in his writing. It doesn't bog down the story in any way, but rather gives the story plausibility.   This book is akin to Andromeda Strain and is great for a trip in a car, plane, etc.
1580812635|3.0|The audio version was just OK, while it was great to have different voices for the characters, the audio version left out so much that you really couldn't appreciate how great the story really is.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Ok- This show is highly addictive.  I don't have HBO, so I watched the dvd's for the first time. It is an excellent show, that gives you a craving to go back and watch it again. Not like the books in my opinion. It takes on a different kind of soap-opera feel to it.  Very similar, similar characters, but there is distinct differences in some of them.  And the plot does go a different direction then the books.  I do love it though, and am completly in love with the books.    Enjoy!
1439157383|5.0|My Sister's Keeper, by Jodi Picoult, is a heart-rending family saga. The story revolves around a moral dilemma: is it ethical to conceive one child for the sole purpose of saving another? Gravely ill, Kate was a toddler when she was diagnosed with a progressive form of leukemia. In a last ditch effort to save their beloved child, Sara and Brian Fitzgerald conceive a biologically engineered daughter for her umbilical cord, tissues, blood, and ultimately an organ. Anna literally becomes her sister's keeper for as long as she's alive. When it comes to donating her kidney to her dying sister, Anna seeks legal representation for the freedom to make her own medical decisions. Anna's courage holds the family together while at the same time tearing them apart.<br /><br />Best-selling author Picoult formulates entire stories based on current issues and successfully weaves tales that explore both sides of an argument. Society now has the ability to tamper with genetics, to experiment on human subjects in the name of science and medicine, but does that mean it is permissible, ethical, and in humanity's best interests? My Sister's Keeper serves to clarify as much as confuse because there aren't clear-cut right or wrong answers when love and emotion collide with rational judgment. It comes down to what role love plays in making tough decisions. Who has the final say over a minor's destiny? Should an adolescent be granted permission to make a potentially life and death decision, or should her parents be ultimately responsible?<br /><br />Picoult presents worst-case scenarios of both the patient, Kate, and the donor, Anna. She uses crisp and witty dialogue to reveal the path each girl has chosen and gives readers insight from a teen's perspective, complete with all the sibling rivalry and closeness two sisters can share. From the opening pages, the author grips the reader's heart and doesn't let go. We see the mental and emotional anguish inside the adults who play key roles in these two children's lives. Picoult provides multiple first-person points of view, which give glimpses into the entire family's well-being and affirms the intense love of parent for child and sibling for sibling. She deftly reveals the impact that lawyers, doctors, judges, other family members, and friends have on the entire family unit.<br /><br />Read My Sister's Keeper and discover the many, many ways in which Picoult illuminates everyday experiences and, by her craft as an author, lifts them from the mundane to the extraordinary. While one's heart aches, one's spirit is enriched from living life through another's eyes.

0439023491|5.0|If you thought the Capitol couldn't get any more twisted... you were wrong.<br /><br />The highly-anticipated sequel to The Hunger Games is the kind of novel that has you pulling back to take a breath and go, \\"How did the author think of this?\\" (if you can stop turning the pages long enough to breathe)<br /><br />Catching Fire picks up right where Hunger Games left off.  Unrest in the Districts is growing at an alarming pace and Katniss unwittingly finds herself the figurehead for the movement against the Capitol.  The characters you loved return for the sequel and the reader must endure each indignity the Capitol inflicts upon them.  It is painful, tortuous, imaginative and motivating.  It is everything The Hunger Games was and more.  It both answers your lingering questions and creates so many new ones.  It challenges you to think and creates such feelings of empathy for the characters that whenever I had to put the book down, I was genuinely worried for leaving the characters hanging and couldn't wait to pick it back up just so they could continue fighting for their lives and freedoms.<br /><br />Everything I loved about The Hunger Games is present in Catching Fire: the unique and engrossing storyline; characters so thoroughly and beautifully described they start to feel like friends; a fantastical setting that is both real and sad; and language that is easy to read and yet conveys such a profound meaning.  It has action, romance, horror, hope, despair and, most of all, humanity.  It has sci-fi and politics yet, unlike a lot of books on the market, they are not \\"in your face\\" and are completely approachable.<br /><br />Due to elements of violence and some light romantic scenes, I would recommend it for 13+.  That being said, I would recommend it for ANYONE 13+ of any reading taste or background: as a bookseller and a recent library school graduate, these are the books I find easiest to recommend to anyone I meet.<br /><br />I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the third and final book to come out.  After reading Catching Fire, I know you will be too.the third and final book to come out.  After reading Catching Fire, I know you will be too.
B001041JKU|5.0|I was looking for a special book to mark my 500th review for Amazon and had settled on an excellent VINE book when I paused to watch Michael Jackson's memorial. Actress Brooke Shields moved me to tears with her tribute to her dear friend, as did Martin Luther King III and many others. But when Usher sang, his words rang with magical truth: \\"Like a comet...\\" ... \\"Like a rainbow...\\"<br /><br />That's when I decided to review [[ASIN:B001041JKU Michael Jackson 25th Anniversary of Thriller]] which is his most unforgettable offering to the world, the first presentation that people mention when remembering him.<br /><br />I remember watching THRILLER on TV with my chlldren twenty-five years ago when we were all a little younger and this fabulous talent was just \\"coming into his own.\\" Wow--what a mesmerizing performance.<br /><br />When MJ passed away, as a tribute I ordered this remastered version of THRILLER because it has extra tracks and I wanted to see what was included.<br /><br />Who could ever forget any of the ground-breaking songs on this album? In addition to my favorites THRILLER and BILLIE JEAN, other hits are featured: \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',\\" \\"Baby Be Mine,\\" \\"The Girl Is Mine,\\" \\"Beat It,\\" \\"Human Nature, \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\" and \\"The Lady In My Life.\\" All are brilliant examples of Michael's rare gifts for song and dance.<br /><br />A bonus that will make this remastered THRLLER even more special and timely during this \\"grieving period\\" is that it contains a personal greeting penned by Michael for his fans...exclusively for this special release.<br /><br />Yes, The King of Pop was \\"one of a kind.\\" His awesome, angelic voice, his magical, masterful dances, his inspiring, innovative creations and his deep love for his fans is legend! His music will live forever in our hearts.<br /><br />Long Live the King!<br /><br />With delicious pleasure and a certain amount of pain I recommend this \\"biggest album of all time.\\"<br /><br />Dedicated to his beloved fans.

B001V9LRTM|5.0|In the Summer of '69, I was in broadcasting school in Atlanta (I was a DJ back when it was fun). A crowd of us headed over to the Atlanta Rock Festival, joining roughly 250,000 other fans who heard Mountain live for the first time, and saw Jimi Hendrix preview his Woodstock performance. A few days later, everyone was talking about a show coming up in NY that was going to be even bigger. We HAD to go.<br /><br />Some reviewers might complain about the video quality, although I think it is great. However, for me it simply is a mnemonic to a much greater, IMAX-quality memory.<br /><br />What I really like is the remastered sound. On my new 7.1 sound system, it is gloriously authentic!<br /><br />If you are of the younger crowd and have heard us hippie geezers talk about Woodstock, here is your chance to see as complete a rendering of the experience as you will find anywhere. And, if you were there, please take advantage of this wonderful time machine and revisit the pastures (and quagmires) of our youth.
0765316897|5.0|I'm extremely impressed with Brandon Sanderson's first fantasy trilogy. The entire story was carefully thought out, well-plotted, and well-paced. What impresses me most is that in this last installment, The Hero of Ages, there are plenty of wonderful surprises left.<br /><br />But these surprises aren't little add-ons that Sanderson lately thought up and decided to throw in just to keep up the interest and excitement. These are major pieces of the puzzle that have purposely been left for the characters (and therefore the readers) to discover. Back in The Final Empire, the first book of the Mistborn trilogy, I thought Brandon Sanderson had created a unique and really cool magic system. That was nothin' -- it gets even better!<br /><br />Finally, we understand the origin and purpose of the koloss, kandra, and inquisitors. Now we know what the Lord Ruler has been about for his 1000 year reign, what the mists are doing, and how people get allomantic powers. All of our questions are answered in fact, and you probably will have guessed some of the answers, but others will surprise you, I think. The end of The Hero of Ages is bittersweet, just as I like my fantasy. We are left with hope and light, not in despair, but there was a high cost to what was achieved.<br /><br />One thing I particularly liked about this series is the way that the \\"bad guys\\" are not universally and one-dimensionally evil (except for one, who is an evil \\"force\\"). Some of them aren't really \\"bad guys\\" at all. In addition, most of the characters are logical, no matter which \\"side\\" they're on. The \\"enemies\\" are just as reasonable, intelligent, and well-spoken as our heroes. Vin, Elend, Spook, Sazed (etc.) don't blow anyone away with superior plans, arguments, or bravery -- they find that their antagonists are just as well prepared.<br /><br />As usual, the audio version of this novel is high quality. The narrator, Michael Kramer, is excellent, though he was inconsistent with Spook's voice. Mr. Sanderson has drastically cut back on the number of times a character \\"paused,\\" so that was no longer an irritation.<br /><br />I heartily recommend the Mistborn series for anyone looking for an original, well constructed epic which is satisfyingly finished in three volumes. If you listen to audiobooks, that's a great format for this series. If you have not read Mistborn, put it at the top of your list.e number of times a character \\"paused,\\" so that was no longer an irritation.

B00009P57O|5.0|I distinctly remember running out to get Synchronicity on vinyl back when it was originally released; and on CD it still sounds so good today! It is indeed one of The Police's best albums--and maybe their best album ever. Their music stands the test of time and it's very well performed. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and the artwork uses the artwork from the front cover of the record album.<br /><br />\\"Synchronicity I\\" starts the album off with a strong tune; they sing and play this like the pros they were and still remain! They handle the beat faultlessly and I'm impressed. \\"Walking in Your Footsteps\\" uses the percussion very well; they do this one to perfection--and beyond. The musical effects are perfect for this number, too. \\"Walking in Your Footsteps\\" is a highlight of this album. In addition, \\"O My God\\" has The Police doing nothing less than their very best--and that's terrific. The beat is great and those drums combine with the guitar work to enhance the number all the more.<br /><br />\\"Miss Gradenko\\" has that Police flavor to it; they make this shine bright as they pull this off without a hitch! They don't sing or play a single superfluous note and I love it. Then we get the huge, huge hit from this album, \\"Synchronicity II.\\" \\"Synchronicity II\\" is probably my favorite tune by The Police; it was cool back then and it's still cool now. Listen for The Police to rock hard on the foreboding \\"Synchronicity II,\\" too. \\"Every Breathe You Take\\" is a very special number; they sing this wonderfully and their passionate delivery makes this song all the more emotional. Again, I really love this music--this is all THAT good.<br /><br />\\"King of Pain\\" is another brilliant tune that Sting and the rest of The Police make outstanding with their superb treatment of it; I really like \\"King of Pain.\\" \\"Wrapped around Your Finger\\" is quite a song; I doubt you'll forget this song anytime soon if you haven't heard it before. \\"Wrapped around Your Finger\\" is a masterpiece and that's grand. The CD ends strong with The Police performing a bonus track called \\"Murder by Numbers.\\" \\"Murder by Numbers\\" has great percussion and Sting never falters as he sings his lyrics. The music that plays fits in perfectly with the vocals.<br /><br />Overall, if you want high quality control music from The Police, this is one album you must get for your collection. I highly recommend this classic album..

B0018YIFEK|3.0|I waited a long time to get this book and when it was finally my turn and it arrived, I started reading it right away.  I will say it was very good.  I was sucked in from page 5 or so and always wanted to sit down and read it.  But now that I'm done, looking back, there is nothing that particularly stands out about it.  I thought maybe it was a book that I would read again, but now I know it isn't.    The ending did surprise me.  I think my mouth dropped open, but again, now that it's over, it's not that big a deal.  Truthfully I found it unbelievable and I thought it was a cop out.    To be honest, I thought Anna's mother was absolutely awful all those times Anna couldn't do something because she had to be there for Kate.  She was trying to keep her daughter alive so hard that she forget to let her other daughter live.  That's what I remember.    I still think all the flashbacks and odd stories that are just pulled out of thin air (seriously, no one just suddenly remembers a time when they were 9 or a time when the people across the street moved out) don't fit in.  The family has the most amazing memory for remembering all these odd times that seem to add nothing to the story and every other paragraph you get away from the true story to learn about a time when so and so was three.  And that's what I remember.  I'm not sure that a book is all that great if the one thing you really remember about it is continuously thinking, \\"No one would remember this \\"flashback\\" and it doesn't add anything to the story anyway.\\"

B000RP4LEO|4.0|This new recording of the \\"Emperor\\" Concerto arrived not long after I had completed my comparisons of two recordings of that venerable composition for The $ensible Sound's Issue No. 114. For more than a month, though, I simply could not bring myself to listen to another version. I was Emperored out!<br /><br /> Having put the CD atop a pile of CDs that I needed to review, I often caught the intense eyes of Ms. Grimaud staring up at me, imploring me to give her recording an audition. When I finally yielded to her gentle pleading, I was glad I did. This is an excellent performance, one that I prefer to either of the performances I compared in Issue 114. It has both power and grace, with excellent playing from both the soloist and the orchestra. Ms. Grimaud, Maestro Jurowski, and the members of the Staatskapelle Dresden combine to do Beethoven proud. Bravo!<br /><br /> In addition to her exuberant rendition of the Concerto, Ms. Grimaud also provides a fine recording of Sonata No. 28, a wonderfully lyrical work for solo piano that is always a delight to hear. This is music that sings and soars, never failing to capture the imagination. These two pieces together provide a rewarding program that will reward the listener.<br /><br /> I do have some slight reservations about the sound, however. At times, the orchestra sounds a bit threadbare, which I am not sure is the engineering or the musicians, although I suspect the former, as the overall sound spectrum seems a bit tilted up. Not harsh, just lacking in the warmth that would make it a top-flight sonic achievement. There was also occasional thumping sound to heard during the Concerto; perhaps a system without a subwoofer would not have revealed this sonic anomaly (and I must admit that I had my subwoofer volume set too high at the time I listened to this CD). Still, the performances are simply wonderful, and I recommend this disc highly to all fans of this music, of which I suspect there are many among our readership.

B000YDOOU0|5.0|Guitarist Metheny and bassist McBride are the well-known members of this trio, but it is drummer Sanchez who makes the most indelible impression with his incredibly energetic and flavorful playing. What a dynamo! Although Metheny's past couple of recordings with the Pat Metheny Group have tended toward the grandiose, this trio setting strips the arrangements down to a more pure jazz style that gives all three musicians an opportunity to shine. The end result is a pure feast for the ears, the best thing that Metheny has done in several years.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I recently ordered this from Amazon and the version I received had the *correct* theatrical subtitles, not the slapdash ones people are complaining about. I double-checked this.<br /><br />This is a beautiful evocative vampire movie.

0307341569|4.0|Libby Day, 31 years old, is a depressed, at times suicidal young woman.  And she has every right to be:  When she was seven years old, her mother and two sisters were murdered, in what was later called \\"The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas\\" and \\"The Prairie Massacre.\\"  Libby survived by crawling out a window of the family farmhouse where they lived, and where the others died.  The only other surviving family member was Libby's then 15-year-old brother, Ben - the person who Libby later testified was the killer.   Michelle, 10, was strangled, Debby, 9, died of axe wounds, and the mother, Patty, of 2 shotgun wounds [her head nearly blown off ], axe wounds [her body axed nearly in two], and deep cuts from a hunting knife.    The story opens 24 years later.  Libby has managed all the intervening years by dint of the money from a trust fund set up by sympathetic members of the public following the trial and the attendant publicity.  But that money has nearly run out, leading Libby to consider an offer from a group calling itself The Kill Club, a macabre secret society obsessed with notorious crimes, which will pay Libby to interview Ben and others about That Night.  The Kill Club, it should be noted, believes Ben is innocent.  Ultimately Libby begins to question the accuracy of her memories.    Libby is a thoroughly dysfunctional, nihilistic personality, routinely pessimistic, who \\"assumed everything bad in the world could happen, because everything bad in the world already did.\\"  She still thinks of herself as \\"the one who lived,\\" and as Baby Day and Orphan Day, as the tabloids had variously referred to her at the time, and says \\"I was raised feral, and I mostly stayed that way,\\" and makes the reader understand that the darkest place of all can be one's mind.    The p.o.v. changes from Libby, in the present [the only 1st person voice], to Ben and Patty, from the days before \\"that last summer before the end,\\" and more specifically to The Day.    This was not an easy book to read.  Libby is as much of an anti-hero as one will meet in a novel, and being in her mind a harrowing foray.  But the book is difficult to put down, and whatever the reader may expect at the end, the author will surprise you.  Recommended.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|I was at the VHS section of Hollywood Video and saw this movie covered in dust, along with all the other VHS tapes. I thought it was weird because VHS tapes are the latest technology! Anyway, I didn't hesitate to rent this because it was very critically acclaimed and is generally considered one of the greatest films of all-time. The dude at the cash register laughed and said, \\"This is one of the worst movies ever!\\" and suggested me some Godfather crap. I told him that I liked movies like SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2, Disaster Movie and From Justin To Kelly. He stopped laughing for some reason. So I get home and pop Showgirls into my VHS player and I'm blown away! The unpredictable plot, tasteful use of nudity and good acting really made me wonder why this movie hasn't won Oscars! Recommended for all.
0061537969|1.0|I found the writing and story stagnant.  An old lab wishes to be allowed to die so he can be reincarnated as a human.  The book takes us thru his life with his owner.  They live in an apt. so the dog watches TV all day.  Very dull.    I am absolutely STUNNED at the 4 1/2 star rating. The guy can't write at all.    I quit before the half mark. Dull. Mono.
1402545355|5.0|I listened to the amazing audio version from Recorded Books. The narrator, Lisette Lecat, was so delightful. Authentic. I cannot say enough about this book. It took me where I wanted to go. I was with the most charming characters. I fell in love with the place, the people, and definitely Mma Ramotswe.  By the end, I was gabbing my heart and saying \\"how wonderful!\\" as tears came down my face. Please read this book! You will love it. Bravo, Mr. Smith. Can't wait for the next!
B001UW58WW|2.0|Great player, this genre is good for popular music audiences.  However, the rearranged popular pieces are very dull compared to the originals which essentially make these recordings useless.  The Bach and Vivaldi are are done in modern styles, however completely void of the musical nuance these pieces have to offer and pale in comparison to many other recordings of other violinists who do much better jobs with these pieces.  I like how he pulls in the popular crowd towards the classical crowd, but I'd like to see it done with much more exciting musical content.  I think the rest of these arrangements are very dull as well.  He is a great charmer and I hope he continues to improve as a musician.<br /><br />I don't recommend buying this CD, it reinforces the idea that classical music and classical musicians are musically dull, boring, and emotionally musically dead.  This is not always true and has been proven by many other soloists.<br /><br />I give this 2 stars instead of 1 because the notes were accurately played.

B000A32KJQ|4.0|Manu Katch&eacute; is a drummer who has appeared on several ECM releases; as far as I know, this his his first effort as a leader. He has assembled quite a band, including veteran sax man Jan Garbarek, notable  trumpeter Tomasz Stanko, and two members of Stanko's band, Marcin Wasilewki (piano) and Slawomir Kurkiewicz (bass).  All the music was composed by Katch&eacute;, which might lead you to expect driving music, heavy on rhythm and popping with power, but that is not the case. Instead, the music is richly lyrical, with nice contributions by Stanko and Garbarek and solid support from Wasilewki and Kurkiewicz.<br /><br /> Those who tend to shy away from contemporary jazz might find this recording a pleasant surprise, richly rewarding with its melody and expression, yet with enough energy and passion to please real jazz fans. This is not \\"lite jazz.\\" It is enjoyable jazz, well-played and well-recorded, which should appeal to a wide cross-section of listeners.

B0009JAENU|5.0|Listening to these two marvelously talented young women play this delightful music is an occasion for great joy. To hear both of them not only playing their parts but also listening to each other for inspiration is to hear the music of Mozart not as something more than 200 years old, but as something very much alive today.<br /><br /> Those new to classical music often start with large-scale forms--symphonies and concertos. There are also great rewards to be found in the more intimate forms, such as the violin sonatas included in this program. I have listened to recordings of sonatas where it sounded as though the performers were trying to make some sort of academic point; however, listening to these performers made me think that their agenda was simply to get together and play music that they loved to play. How fortunate we are to be able to taste the fruits of that labor of love! To all music fans, I recommend this recording, but especially to those who feel they could use a little comfort and joy in their too-busy lives.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|A local talk show host here in Bakersfield (Ralph Bailey), who happens to be an African American, and a moderate conservative, often says something to the affect of \\"Folks born before WWII get a pass for saying \\"knucklehead\\" racial epitaphs because they lived through the era of segregation an the Civil Rights movement. However, those of us born in or after the \\"Baby Boom\\" should have learned better by now. We had the benefit of growing up watching shows like \\"All in the Family\\", and \\"Sanford & Son\\" to poke vicious satire at bigoted thinking, and so we hope at least to have moved on.<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is a great film that gives us some great lessons in dramatic form. Clint Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a man from that earlier generation and he throws epithets out without ever thinking there is anything wrong with it. He hits white ethnicities as much as he does people of color, and it was weird for me to remember that there was a time when speaking like that was common.<br /><br />But here's the thing, Walt is a good man, prejudiced perhaps but still a good man. Walt is forced to consider his racism when he unwillingly gets to know his neighbors. When he asks his young lady neighbor why her people came to America, she explains that her people (the Hmong), fought in alliance with the USA in the Vietnam war, and when America quit, they left the Hmong high and dry, and would be slaughtered if they stayed behind. It seemed to me to click a connection in Walt's brain, then he began the friendship that became closer than family to him.<br /><br />In \\"Gran Torino\\", Eastwood continues to swing his message away from violent solutions in his films. This is probably my favorite after the \\"Unforgiven\\", of Eastwood's films promoting this message. It is a thoughtful, well written, well acted and well directed film. That really surprised me in the end.<br /><br />One of the best films I've seen in a while!<br /><br />5*<br /><br />Now there is a missed opportunity however, not with the film, but rather with the DVD, There was a great chance to do some documentary work on the change of demographics in American Culture as well as a specific opportunity for some history about the role of the Hmong in the Viet Nam War. Instead there are some rather banal pieces about America's love affair with the Automobile. My first car was a '73 Gran Torino, so if anyone should have liked what they did, it might have been me, but I seldom watch DVD extras, and I still think they missed a great chance to do some more good with this excellent movie.e DVD, There was a great chance to do some documentary work on the change of demographics in American Culture as well as a specific opportunity for some history about the role of the Hmong in the Viet Nam War.

B0028K31CE|5.0|Striking the right balance between what's typical and what's important about music has long been a quality that I've long saught out in R&B especially in the last couple decades.During the 90's I have to admit I ignored Maxwell.It had nothing to do with the fact there was any problem I had with his music but at the time I was deeply interested in the meaningful musical adventures of EWF,P-Funk,Stevie Wonder,Prince,etc.Those who were going for appealing to that musical aestetic by embracing those sounds into the contemporary musical ethic wasn't of much interest to me.Only recently as that style of neo soul has had much appeal to me.Naturalness in music is all well and good but,in the salad days of funk and soul things like futurism,reverb and such were an important factor in that rootedness. That was one of the reasons this album drew me on.For one,it was recommended by my friend who as always has helped put some perspective into my musical journey.Also...I really wanted some Maxwell in my collection.So I made the leap.And what do I think?Well musically this music is impressive in a number of important ways.For one it has the great quality of brevity;it clocks in at under 40 minutes in an age when everyone still is tempted to fill every bit of space on a CD.Also there is the fact that Maxwell and his band,even if it took close to a decade have been able to successfully utilize the newer computerized technology and some of the complication of hip-hop rhythms into the same groove from which it came-back to the funk.\\"Bad Habits\\" and \\"Cold\\",for starters have this terrific interaction between bass,organ,horns and the polyrhythms of the drums into this series of intertwining dynamics that brings out the intensity and emotional honesty of the lyrics.\\"Pretty Winds\\",\\"Playing Possum\\" and \\"Fist Full Of Tears\\" are able to put a similar approch into somewhat slower tunes,a quality I always saw in Prince in past years.\\"Love You\\" is just one of those great songs with a beat that's involving;in a day when the big beats derived from the 80's have become almost too big to hold themselves up here you have a DRIVING beat that isn't complicated but turns your head and a melody that drives the point home.The really impressive part to me is the closer \\"Phoenixrise\\".It's an instrumental,that in itself is a head turner on a modern R&B album but the fact that it puts up to date digital polyphonic synth washes with these jazzily funky polyrhym that extends back to the futurism of funk instrumentals during the mid to late 70's:taking the modern sounds of the day and intergrating them successfully into the context of rooted rhythm.And it's good for his band too because as Maxwell is continuing to develop he's having his musicians join him on the same journey. Those admirable qualities aside I have only one minor issue with this:the simple fact that Maxwell's softer singing voice seems rooted primarily in slow tunes. Sometimes when the tempo goes up his voice almost blends into the mix rather than elevate up with the dynamics of the music surrounding him.True it's a distinctive technique in a way but with the passing of Michael Jackson,a singer rooted singing uptempo material and could pack a wallop on the softest of ballads it makes me remember how \\"naturalness\\" in singers has almost eliminated that particular quality from contemporary R&B. At the same time even with the vocals quality not being that punchy this album is something that I highly recommend based on it's creativity of sound and inventiveness.gs with a beat that's involving;in a day when the big beats derived from the 80's have become almost too big to hold themselves up here you have a DRIVING beat that isn't complicated but turns your head and a melody that drives the point home.The really impressive part to me is the closer \\"Phoenixrise\\".It's an instrumental,that in itself is a head turner on a modern R&B album but the fact that it puts up to date digital polyphonic synth washes with these jazzily funky polyrhym that extends back to the futurism of funk instrumentals during the mid to late 70's:taking the modern sounds of the day and intergrating them successfully into the context of rooted rhythm.And it's good for his band too because as Maxwell is continuing to develop he's having his musicians join him on the same journey.

B001O2ZW1A|5.0|Musicians are a peculiar lot - some take three years or more to create increasingly bland product, while others are so creative and prolific one can barely keep up with them.  Devin Townsend, another favorite of mine springs to mind.  Steve Wilson, leader of Porcupine Tree and several other projects, has issued his first solo CD, \\"Insurgentes\\", and like PT, it swirls, caresses and then slams you into a concrete wall.<br />  Featuring a who's who of progressive musicians, including Tony Levin and PT's own drummer, Gavin Harrison, \\"Insurgentes\\" is a bit moodier than Porcupine Tree.  It's quite similiar in most respects, which one could file under \\"Duh\\", since Wilson is the creative genius in PT, but here we get some decidedly darker moments, such as the closing moments of \\"Abandoner\\", which could contain the heaviest or grungiest guitar tones ever recorded over a celestial background.  Talk about contrast.  \\"Get All You Deserve\\" also fries out in a wash of noise, only to lead into the title track which opens with a plaintive solo piano.<br />  Wilson's vocals, always understated and tranquil, and his stellar guitar work, not to mention anything else he can get his hands on, are the textbook assets of a great debut solo CD.  We can only expect more brilliance from a man who has already produced a body of work that few can match.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|As said by others - so far so good.  In looking for this battery, I have gone to several local stores to find either they were out of stock or some ridiculous price (I think one store had the price of one battery for what I paid for 5!).  Unless something changes my mind, I would buy again from this seller.
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|Mind you, this review is coming from someone who could care less about the STAR TREK series and films. I went along with a few friends to see this, and while I really enjoyed the first forty minutes, the rest of the film was rather weak. I didn't care for any of the characters. Maybe it's just me. Science fiction is my least favorite genre. I can say this: the acting was well done. I was surprised by how good they were. Bravo to the actors. As for the rest of the film, well, lets just say I won't be seeing it again.     See it if you must. Trekkies will get a lot more out of the film than I did. In fact, I'm sure they'll have a blast.
1400063736|4.0|Compare the review by Frank McCourt that goes  to the heart of the novel with the review (sic)by  Publisher's Weekly which is merely a synopsis (a  poor one at that) of the novel. What's with this  currrent trend for reviewers to reveal the plotlines?  That is not their job; that is not literate reviewing.  Obviously Frank McCourt allowed time to pass before  writing his thoughtful commentary. And he knows how to write,   which is more than can be said for the Publisher's Weekly  tyro.  I feel that Amazon owes it to its readers not  to publish plot summaries that trivialize the suthor's  work.  Lately the NYTimes is guilty of that as well.  Tant pis!
B0028SVXR6|4.0|I have listened to 3 TMV albums now - Deloused, Bedlam, and Octahedron. Starting with Bedlam (a mistake on my part, it's not an accesible album at all) I hated the Mars Volta. My friends urged me to pick up Deloused. It was alright, but nothing great. On the spur of the moment, I picked up Octahedron yesterday in my local record store. I'm blown away! After listening 3 times, it's just so beautiful. The vocals have improved. The chaos is still chaotic, but has been subdued. An interesting album, I'm gonna go back and give the Volta another try.
B000U6DU92|5.0|One of the few entertaining shows on TV.  Not that that's saying much; still, definitely worth a watch if you like sci-fi and humor rolled into one.  The science is sometimes a little questionable, but that's okay because Eureka is really character-driven.  Where else would you find the garage mechanic is an existential physicist, the town dog-catcher has hunted wild beasts from Africa to the Arctic, and the local shrink runs a bed-and-breakfast with emphasis on the \\"bed\\", if you get my drift.  Add a Deputy whom, except for the by-the-book fanaticism, is very little like Barney Fife (better looking for one thing, and way more competent) and an Opie who may be autistic but can do differential calculus (on sidewalks) and you have \\"Eureka\\".  One can only wonder if there's an Otis the Town Drunk lurking somewhere...and what he's imbibing.  4.5*'s at least.
0385341008|5.0|Isola, one of the delightful characters in this captivating book, believes that \\"reading good books ruins you for enjoying bad ones\\". Having just finished Elizabeth Strout's disappointing [[ASIN:0812971825 Abide with Me: A Novel]], I must agree with her. Although Ms. Strout's book was well written, the characters were hardly memorable and the ending felt contrived and incredible. By contrast, some of the characters in \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" will stay with me for quite some time, as will the charming storyline. Although Mary Ann Shaffer is no longer with us her words and generous spirit will live on in this unforgettable epistolary novel. I would highly recommend Helene Hanff's [[ASIN:0140143505 84, Charing Cross Road]] for readers who enjoy a story told by way of letters.
B000002LQR|5.0|This album is pure joy, moment by moment, from start to finish.  I don't think there's a lacklustre second on the whole album.  When I first heard this I was about 13 or 14, and just getting into guitar.  I can honestly say that if I hadn't heard this album my life would have been very different.      The energy that the musicians manage to get onto this album is astounding.      Of all the music that the Chili Peppers have done over the years, I think this album is the one that defined the band.  Up to this point they were musos that were really into funk and being silly, without depth to their songs.  After this point they seem confused and addled by their own success, and have tried to carry the flame that burned so bright on this album for another (nearly) two decades after it was a natural statement.  On this album, there is a convergence of forces that is truly rare and extremely special.  Things like this don't happen very often.
1582701709|4.0|I love and have read many, many metaphysical books.

I<br />found myself laughing out loud and excited to try some of the<br />exercises.  They were fun, too.  I'm a little bit of a skeptic too,<br />which is probably why I waited until after the hubbub died down a bit,<br />before I read it.  I'm so glad that I did.

0812550757|5.0|I just finished the second of the \\"Ender\\" Series by Orson Scott Card, sadly, about 5 years after reading \\"Ender's Game\\", which now demands to be re-read. But not before finishing the series! Rest assured, there are no spoilers in this review but let me tell you this: I am a doctor (medical) and admit that although I have read many, many  hundreds of books (I'm speaking only of pleasure reading here, not the reading required for any school), am an aspiring author with a 3/4 finished sci-fi novel myself that isn't half so good as the one I'm reviewing now and have a very eclectic taste, I do most enjoy science fiction. But there is so little truly-great science fiction to read; many novels are clever or have a novel twist but few take your breath away. The hugeness of many of Asimov's or Stephen Baxter's novels brings greatness to them and there are some great \\"hard science-fiction books as well, but this second in the \\"Ender\\" series reads more like those of Octavia Butler (I especially admired \\"Kindred\\" and all three of the \\"Xenogenesis\\" series. If you haven't heard of her, do some reading and read her; you won't be sorry). I hate that I read \\"Ender\\"s Game\\" so long ago but I definitely remember enough of it to know how different \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is. Does that mean you should skip the first book? No! Not at all. Just don't wait to read the second. They are so different, I think in the way science and religion are different: two completely-different ways of examining the world around us. Honest self-disclosure: although born to a Jewish family, I have read the entire bible and spent about 20 years counting myself a Christian. I no longer do so, but rather have come to believe simply that everything is connected (probably in a quantum way) and that it's in a way I don't understand. That's enough for me. This book is similar: there is much science in it but it is a story about people, not necessarily always human, but people nevertheless. What you need to know about the sequel to \\"Ender\\" is the poetry and beauty of its prose, the huge expanse of the author's imagination, and how immensely-spiritual the story is. This book is far better, far different than it's prequel and shows an author whose talents and imagination finally brought me to tears near the end of the book. Read it, in its proper place, after \\"Ender's Game\\", even knowing it is better. I think you will appreciate it all the more.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I bought the DVD of the TV series \\"True Blood\\" without ever having seen an episode.  \\"I wanna do bad things with you\\" summoned me from the begininning credits.  I am hooked.  I even have my super picky husband watching with me!  I think he likes the nudity?!  We finished the first season one week before season two was to premiere on HBO.  We immediately called our cable subscriber & told them, \\"We need our Sookie & Bill!\\"  I especially enjoyed the special features.  The 60 Minutes-type mockumentary about vampire rights is realistic and entertaining.  I recommend this series to everyone over 18 so much so that I bought a copy for my best friend!
B0028K31CE|4.0|Let me first say that I love Maxwell...I own every album. He's the only R&B artist I'll listen to. I bought his CD because I wanted him to get the financial support for all his time and effort. To me, his music embodies romance.    Unfortunately, that's what I found missing from most of the tracks on this album (Pretty Wings not included). There's a softness that's gone, replaced with an edge that's innovative and soulful, but not romantic. Even his lyrics seem to be a little less...inspired. What I really love about him is his abstract take on romance and all the emotions that go with it. This album moves more toward a realist approach, both musically and lyrically.     Don't get me wrong. The album is definitely worth picking up. He's made some major steps in his development as a musician. Vocally he roams into new territory that I can't even say he touched on in previous works. So while this might not have knocked me off my feet, it does draw me in to explore, which is one thing about him that hasn't changed at all.    All this said, his music tends to grow on me, so we'll see what happens as I give it a few more listens. Thanks Maxwell!
B0028K3192|4.0|Maxwell Rivera, the R&B veteran 1st studio album in over 8 years, and 4th studio album (not counting [[ASIN:B000002C1T Maxwell Unplugged]]) of his career, comes with the highly anticipated BLACKsummmers'night, an album I've been waiting for over some time myself. Maxwell has always had good voice. Even times when the lyrics aren't that good to a song he used his voice to carry a listener through a song over some nice production (a very popular formula in music). I really was never a big fan of him when I first heard him on the video \\"Luxury:Cococure\\" (I don't know about you but seeing a video of a grown man half naked in a bathtub seems to traumatize me even 11 years later). Overall he has created some classics like his previous album [[ASIN:B00005NKK5 Now]]. BLACKsummers'night really has a cool laidback vibe whereas the type of atmosphere you can listen to with someone you love, or on a laid back evening, as he's always created those smooth tunes to play in your mind. The big problem that I have that this album is short, with nine tracks, just under 38 minutes total.<br /><br />Some of the songs here on BLACKsummers' night are really hit or miss, mostly on the side of the better. \\"Bad Habits\\" really is a nice starter for the album, followed by the lead single \\"Cold\\" with a little upbeat. \\"Prettywings\\" and \\"Stoptheworld\\" both slows things down, for a laid back atmosphere, a style I love, and I'm sure you will too. \\"Helpsomebody\\" is cool, but it really fails to stand out, both lyrically and musically. \\"Loveyou\\" maybe has the potential to be a great song, but I'm just not seeing it here. \\"Fistfuloftears\\" has great lyrics, but personally I'm not feeling the production here. Playingpossum\\" is another slow song with a nice acoustic guitar playing by Hood David in the background. The album ends with a groovy instrumental \\"Phoenixrise\\". Maxwell usually ends his albums with nice tracks like this, but the only problem I have is that it is only 2 minutes and 38 seconds.<br /><br />With all the hype over the summer for Maxwell, BLACKsummmers'night had the potential to be a superior album, but falls short. Some may think this album seems kind of rushed, but I find it hard to believe with someone who has taken 8 years off, could have came up with something a little better, (and longer too). The music and the voice is there, and has always been there, but fans know that he can do better. On a scale of 1-10, this album is somewhere between a 7 and an 8. Older fans will see enjoyment, while other fans may be disappointed. For all you younger fans (such as myself), you might wanna get up on [[ASIN:B00005NKK5 Now]] (\\"I gotta get to know ya...\\"), and let a grown man show how a great album is supposed to be made.

B000GG4Y3M|5.0|Black Rain stars detective Michael Douglass as Nick with his partner Andy Garcia as Charlie. They're both New York cops. Right from the beginning of the film we see Nick motorcyle racing in the streets. So we know he's somewhat of a wild cop. After that he has an internal affairs interegation on him, and we meet his partner Charlie along the way. There's a nice contrast to the reason he's investigated and the choices he makes later in the film.<br /><br />Nick and Charlie have their first encounter with an upcoming Yakuza member Sato played by Yusaku Matsuda in a resturaunt. He plays a very good villian. Sato and his henchmen interrupt a deal going on. The detectives just happen to be relaxing at that same resturaunt. Nick and Charlie soon go after Sato. They end up capturing him but not too easily.<br />At this point the movie changes completly with how the main characters have to deal with anything. All what happend before was only 20 minutes in New York. They are requested to transport Sato as prisoner back to Japan.<br /><br />Unfortunately Sato makes a very tricky escape and eludes the two detectives. They are brought before the police chief of that area of Japan. They argue with the chief to finaly be allowed to stay as observers to finding Sato. Even though they are supposed to be observers only, Nick and Charlie think otherwise.<br /><br />The two detectives ways of doing things clash with the japanese poilce, especially their assigned escort Masahiro played by Ken Takakura. If anything his real purpose is to make sure they stay out of their police departments way. Nick and Charlie are quickly aware of this. Nick and Masahiro really do not get along. Nick and Masahiro do things totally opposite so they clash. It makes for good conflict in an already awkward situation.<br /><br />Charlie is the one who actually tries to get Nick and Masahiro to get along better, which is a difficult task best. As the two detectives get closer to finding Sato, the more trouble they find themselves in. The action really goes up as this happens. Sato has his own plans with them. There's quite a bit of drama in between action points, which I like. You really find out what these 3 characters are all about.<br /><br />This movie is my favorite cop movie, it just does things much differently. There's some very good action that mixes the drama very well.<br />The story changes quite alot, it's hard to predict sometimes what will happen as opposed to most others. So this movie should definetly be seen.on really goes up as this happens. Sato has his own plans with them. There's quite a bit of drama in between action points, which I like.

B0028K31CE|4.0|Maxwell Rivera, the R&B veteran 1st studio album in over 8 years, and 4th studio album (not counting [[ASIN:B000002C1T Maxwell Unplugged]]) of his career, comes with the highly anticipated BLACKsummmers'night, an album I've been waiting for over some time myself. Maxwell has always had good voice. Even times when the lyrics aren't that good to a song he used his voice to carry a listener through a song over some nice production (a very popular formula in music).

B000002WPI|5.0|When i first heard this cd i had high expections and on my first listen i didn't get what was so special. Bt this is probably my favrotie cd of all time beacuse first it's unique and hard hitting i recomend this cd to anyone who has just started listening or has been already listening this cd is classic and one star reviewers have no idea what their talking about.
0060751967|5.0|A powerful paranormal romance, How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire is not only a great modern romantic vampire story, its full of crime, adventure, mafia (Russian), dentist jokes, and of course hot blooded vampire lore.   I liked the unique premise - who would have thought that vampires need dentists...I'm hoping that after death I'm never seeing mine again - however....this is still a great book to get your teeth into.....A read two other very different vampire books this summer, that I can recommend too, both have romantic sides, but are more gothic - still they are VERY good stories and well written - both the kind of books you will hope will never end.  No matter what, all of these three books will keep you awake all night....Enjoy!    [[ASIN:1442131748 VARNISS THE VAMPIRE: A ROMANCE OF BLOOD]]    [[ASIN:1442134488 The House of the Vampire]]

B00260HH3K|4.0|Basically, if you want it to be exactly like the series, turn around now.  If you are willng to undertand that this is a 90 minute version of a multi-episode saga from the show, and the fact that they changed a lot of stuff to make the movie more appealing to non-Dragonball fans, then you'll understand it is a good movie.  I say good, not super amazing.  The special effects are better than I expected, the fight scenes weren't terrible.      A friend of mine commented that he has gone through so many re-imaginings of Superman that so long as the dude flies, wears a cape and comes from Krypton then he's probably Superman.  I went into the movie with a similar expectations.  If he comes from space, knows martial arts and can learn the kamemhameha, he's probably Goku.    In short, if you want it to be exactly like the show, watch the damn show.  If you are willing to give this a chance, then great.  If you don't like, you are always free to sell it back.

B0000DJE9R|5.0|\\"Number Ones\\" is Michael Jackson's most concise and comprehensive greatest hits collection, that spans his entire solo career from the late seventies all the way to the early '00s.     from Michael's '79 album [[ASIN:B00005QGAT Off the Wall]]:  1) DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH - 3:55  This is pure dance. It's like Michael's version of Saturday Night Fever because it totally has a disco feel with its rhythms and beats. I really enjoy it.     2) ROCK WITH YOU - 3:40  \\"Rock With You\\" picks up where \\"Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough\\" leaves off. But this is more of a smooth and sexy lyrical track. Michael sounds so confident and assured as he sings \\"I want to rock with you all night...\\"     from Michael's '82 album [[ASIN:B000WS4QJG Thriller]]:   3) BILLIE JEAN - 4:52  This is the Michael that millions and millions of kids, all over the globe, completely fell in love with. Even though I was only a baby when this song came out, \\"Billie Jean\\" has always been my very favorite Michael Jackson song. It's the type of song that you can dance to, listen to when you're feeling down, or load it into your iPod and listen to it on a regular basis. Because it has a great hook, a fantastic beat and awesome lyrics that are both powerful and universal. \\"Just remember to always think twice...\\"     4) BEAT IT - 4:17  \\"Beat It\\" is almost like the precursor to Michael's #1 hit \\"Bad\\". It's a very fast and danceable song that is just as much eighties as any of Michael's earlier tracks are seventies staples. This song really helped bridge the gap between the urban dancers and suburban listeners who didn't know what break-dancing was until this song.     5) THRILLER - 5:11  Again, this is one of my very favorite songs and I am sure it's one of your favorites, too. It's a frightening mix of dance, R&B and hip hip. Every time I listen to this song I think of the classic slasher movies of the eighties; it's like a roller coaster, it's scary, but in a thrilling and safe way.     from Michael's '87 album [[ASIN:B00000269M Bad]]:  6) I JUST CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU - 4:11  This is one of Michael's first big hit ballads and one of his biggest hits from the \\"Bad\\" album. \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" showcases an entirely new sound and proves that Michael is a multidimensional artist who can sing, write and perform a large array of melodies.     7) BAD - 4:06  I just adore this song, it's one of Michael's signature hits. I enjoy how it starts out with the horns and then the drums; it's very creative. Michael's voice sounds even more beauteous and enigmatic on this track and this is another one of his songs that showcases yet another incredibly successful and incredibly unique sound.     8) SMOOTH CRIMINAL - 4:16  This is almost like a notch below \\"Bad\\" in terms of the beat and the pace of the track. Michael is singing to a lady named Annie as he pushes through this fast-paced song. The ending instrumental sounds almost like an extended remix because it goes on with the repeat of the chorus which sounds perfect together, as one.     9) THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL - 4:57   This is one of my very favorite songs from \\"Bad\\". It's a great dance song to rock to, or a fantastic date song. It's moving and beautiful and both the lyrics and background melody match like that missing piece that you've been searching for to go into your jigsaw puzzle; it's all a precise fit.    10) MAN IN THE MIRROR - 5:03  Besides \\"Billie Jean\\" this is probably my very favorite Michael Jackson track. And as any longtime or casual fan knows that's no easy accomplishment from a man who's career spans 5 decades and countless hit records. But this song is so moving and so tremendously powerful. The lyrics are eternal and like Michael's legacy will live on forever. \\"If you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and change,\\" those are words to live by, as far as I'm concerned. Like the man who sang it, this song will always be a reminder to me to show others compassion and understanding.     11) DIRTY DIANA - 4:40  The song starts out a little slow but boy does it pick up pace. It hits you like a ton of bricks. This is a fast-paced R&B hit that is extremely underrated. It also has a hard rock feel to it which isn't unusual for a man that crossed all musical borders.      from Michael's '91 album [[ASIN:B00005QGAV Dangerous]]:   12) BLACK OR WHITE - 3:18  This is why they call Michael The King of Pop, because this is truly why he's the King! I was in junior high when this song came out and I can remember listening to the cassette every morning on the bus to school. It's another fast and danceable track that has a very firm and grounded message that is just as important as it is beautiful.     from Michael's '95 album [[ASIN:B0000029LG HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]:   13) YOU ARE NOT ALONE - 4:33  This is a slow pop hit with lots of catchy background beats. It's the type of song that will comfort you when you feel like you're alone or otherwise forgotten.     14) EARTH SONG - 5:00  This song mixes a wide rang of musical genres and is another one of Michael's signature ballads. With it's moving phrases and lyrics, perhaps it no coincidence that this is one of Micahel's singles that he was most the proud of.     from Michael's '01 album [[ASIN:B00005Q4JH Invincible]]:   15) YOU ROCK MY WORLD - 4:26  This is one of Michael's newer songs that has such a retro sound. The background sounds with the strings are amazing. And, Michael as usual sounds flawless and has matching lyrics to go along with the beat.     16) BREAK OF DAWN - 5:29  This is a mid-tempo song that's somewhat fast and somewhat slow. It's reminiscent of some of Michael's earlier tracks on \\"Bad\\". But \\"Break of Dawn\\" firmly has its own identity as one of Michael's very best and most powerful songs of the new millennium.     brand-new track for this album:  17) ONE MORE CHANCE - 3:48  This is a new single that was released for \\"Number Ones\\". Michael doesn't disappoint asthis song is just as fresh and danceable as any of the other tracks. Of course it's a mix of pop, rock, R&B and a little hip hop thrown in for good measure.      from the '81 album [[ASIN:B0012GMWUW The Jacksons Live]]:   18) BEN (LIVE) - 2:58  The very first time I can remember hearing this song was on a Simpsons episode. At the time I was too young to realize that it was one of Michael's greatest hits. Nor did I know that it was a song about an animal. But it's a sweet and perhaps even sad song that showcases Michael's early affinity to the animal kingdom.     MICHAEL JACKSON...    The greatest entertainer of the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s & '00s...    ...Past, preset & future     The King of Pop will live forever as his legacy will always be in his art...    ... that is (t)his music.
0143038583|5.0|From the minute I opened this book, I couldn't find time to do anything else but read it.  I enjoy an author who challenges me to look at things from a different perspective.  Michael Pollan's account of his journey through our food chain was nothing short of brilliant.  I actually felt as if I were along side him making fantastic realizations.  If you are curious about where your food comes from and how it gets to our plates, this is the book for you.  I warn you though, I do feel after reading it as if I have stepped into another reality.  This book contains powerful information that, once read, can not be forgotten. This book may have just changed my life forever!  Enjoy!
B00164GDD2|5.0|Well after ordering this I started reading the Blue-Ray reviews and it started to worry me. The rest of the reviewers made it seem like the picture was horrible and not clear. This is simply not true. I also have a samsung 52\\" 1080p display and thought it looked great. Yes there are some scenes where there is a little grainy feel to it, which I always remember the movie having in the first place. I always felt the movie was filmed that way and geve it its dark characteristic. The clarity of the picture is the best I have seen this movie in. I ask one question of the reviewers that thought it looked bad and that is if you think the grainy look is horrible then don't you think 300 loooks horrible? Because that is how the parts that are grainy looking look to me. It looks like the way 300 was shot. So if you like the movie and want to see it in full HD then don't let the others scare you that badly because too me it was how I always remember the movie looking.
B001FOPODS|5.0|I first saw portions of \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" on PBS, and immediately wanted to purchase a copy. I was dismayed to find out that it was not available in REGION 1 format. I am glad it is now.  Suzie Templeton's short film is a example of the sustaining power and depth of Prokofiev's program music. The synthesis between the score and visual is seamless although the score was written decades ago. In this format, the descriptive nature of the music itself is clearly exemplified and personified. Film music is often written in response to the visual, while here the process is reversed. Templeton's greatest achievement is allowing the viewer to experience the complexity of this piece that Prokofiev ultimately wrote for children.      Furthermore, the extras included fill out the DVD package. A highlight is the documentary about the use of the \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" film as an educational tool to teach elementary school children about music, art, and the relationship between the two.     The film is not only entertaining it is educational.     Highly recommended to those interested in music education, animation buffs, and Russian music fans.

The movie grabs you right from the beginning and never lets you go. You'll be jumping out of your seat as the twisted story progresses. If you're a fan of horror this movie really is a must see. You will not be disappointed, trust me.

1596912863|4.0|I loved it! Absolutely a delightful, easy read. I needed something light, because the last three books I read were on the heavy side! So, I read this book in an evening.    The premise is fun: a thirty-something single woman with an obsession with Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy. (Well, I'm a 40-something married woman who loves Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy!) Jane receives an vacation to an English estate modeled after Austen's world. The guests all take on personas similar to her characters and live their lives as if in 1816 England. It's a cute idea.    The author doesn't make any attempt to write like Jane Austen. Neither does she make pretenses for this being a sequel. I have yet to find any attempted Pride and Prejudice sequel that is worth my time.    Austenland is a delightful book, and definitely worth the couple of hours it took to read.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this movie. what's there not to like about a love story between 2 teenagers AND 2 adults and a \\"nanny\\" that has a way with children that makes everyone wish she was *their* nanny.

0312330537|5.0|A remarkable book, vast, well-told, lyrical, and sometimes epiphanic.      Extremely rewarding and strongly recommended.     I had passing moments of irritation at the narrator's occasional immaturity, so incongruous when juxtaposed with his more prevalent wisdom and insight, but those are small things of which to complain.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Reacher speaks to us. Literally, in his own voice.  Something not heard in several novels is a first person account of what the unstoppable Reacher is thinking. Very cleverly written, Child is at his best in a post-911 world. Can Reacher adapt?  Be sure to start the series at the beginning if you want to evolve with the writing.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is another one of my favorite movies along with \\"North and South\\" and \\"Persuasion\\" Great, clean, chic flick!

B000YIGNKE|5.0|I have had this book for sometime, but never quite got into reading it, because I could not get into the characters from the 1995 film. I thought it to be boring. With the new release of this film in 2007, with Hawkins and Penry-Jones as the main characters, the casting age was more correct to the novel's timeframe. I found this movie, and the novel (now that I have read it) to be my favorite to date, with P&P coming in second. What a wonderful story. Loved it! Have read it only twice so far.
B001041JLE|5.0|First let me say that I'm a \\"OF\\" (orignal fan) from the ABC days and I already have both the original album and cd. But this is well worth the getting again, especially with the dvd of his explosively groundbreaking performance of Billie Jean on Motown 25. RIP MJ...my tears and sorrow have not ceased.
031606792X|3.0|I have loved the twilight series and was extremely excited about what was to happen to the series with breaking dawn.  It was not what I expected at all.  Bella having a baby? I don't know how I feel about that.  Also, was it just me or was the ending quite anti-climatic. I was feeling what the romanian covenant was feeling on the matter; it was practically 40pgs of a back and forth, should we fight, sequence that was way to long.      I was however, happy that bella and edward ended with one another; as much as i loved jacob.       overall... it was okay; a little bit long.  I still love the series. :D
B0000542D2|4.0|Yeah, this movie is a silly at many times but it's supposed to be and, by now, just to have so many of the early Beatles songs on one film is a real treat, like a collector's item.    The old songs permeate this movie and sound great in 5.1 digital surround, as opposed to how they first sounded on records when they were released decades ago.    The story is really nothing but showing the Beatles traveling to do a concert and quirky behind-the-scenes goings-on. This is a good period piece because of the dress, songs and British expressions of the day (i.e. \\"Grotty,\\" meaning \\"grotesque.\\")    This movie offers great nostalgia to all who loved The Beatles and their songs.  I'm wondering what happened to the Blu-Ray that was supposedly issued. It's a shame; I'd like to see this on the best format available.

I am looking forward to the other CD's that will be released at a later date.    I am disappointed that he did not have Philadelphia, PA on his BLACKsummer's night tour list.  Maybe next time!
0316154687|5.0|I recommend this book whole heartedly.  It illicit a full belly laugh from the written word is a challenge and time after time I am placed in a state of joy.<br /><br />Sedaris's humor and lifestyle may not be for everyone, but if you are one of the few who enjoy this humor, then embrace it.  Read it slow, and savor it like a fine chocolate. Then pray to god you forget 98% of it, so you can enjoy it again.
0143038419|5.0|I savored every word of this book. Ms. Gilbert writes so you are right there with her...eating pizza in Naples, meditating on a rooftop at an Ashram in India, even being cured by a healer for a bladder infection in Bali. This book is funny, entertaining, and such a helpful perspective in finding ones own path separate and apart from a marriage or a boyfriend. Ms. Gilbert really comes full circle and it is such an inspiration. I didn't want this book to end.
6304698623|5.0|I don't care if the 1995 film adaption had major changes that didn't resemble the original book written many years ago. Honestly, this is the best film I've ever watched in my lifetime being that it was my first film I watched on TV after its theatrical release.    Recently watching it on TV, the English-language version of the film is extremely well done. I loved Liesel Matthews' portrayal of Sara Crewe. She had a very sweet and gentle tone and attitude throughout the film, not to mention brave too. In my opinion, I hated how much Minchin treated Sara just because of her imaginations and fantasy, as well as abusing her powers. She's just a 10 year old! Plus, she's a contradictory witch because she is a thief herself by claiming all of Sara's possessions without consent. If she suffered \\"financial losses\\",she shouldn't go after her wealth. She has to earn it, not steal it, but whatever.    I know what is a real brat and I see one, and its certainly not Sara. Go watch the Spanish dub of 1998's The Parent Trap and you'll see the real definition of a bratty girl. I will always love and enjoy this film no matter what. All of the drama is the reason why I truly enjoy the movie, as well as the sadness present. And btw,    \\"I am a Princess. ALL girls are. Even if they live in tiny old attics... Even if they live in rags... Even if they aren't pretty, OR young, OR smart, they're STILL princesses. ALL of us. Didn't your father ever tell you that? DIDN'T he?\\"    I consider this line as a memorable quote. Stand up for yourself if you're in a terrible situation. Don't ever let someone dominate over you.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I started watching this series because of Alexander skarsgard from True Blood. But then I ended up becoming a big fan of the show itself. I generally hate war movies, because they are usually gruesome and just too much violence for my taste. But I found this series very very realistic, showing the real problems of the Marines, like lack of batteries! I always imagined Americans always had the best equipment at hand etc.   Also the series does not take a stand on the war which I like. All the cast have acted really well, and sometimes it is really funny too. I watched this on On Demand from comcast, but I will buy the DVD. Its definitely worth it.
0143038419|1.0|I think this book should be called \\"sleeping my way across the world\\".  She cheapens the concept of love and what we need to bring peace/respect to our civilization.  This is an \\"Oprah mentality/religious treastise\\".  Pitiful!!!!!
B0026RHR6K|2.0|Sci-fi TV extraordinaire. Hands down the best TV special effects to date. Seasons 1,2,2.5,3 Knocked the socks off every science fiction fan in the universe. Awards, awards and more awards.  BUT, then season 4. Sci-Fi became Dreamland Nonsense. What a WAIST! The creators didn't just drop the ball, they deflated it. The incredible anticipation leading to season 4 evaporated along with the storyline. The acting and special effects, still at a high level, became irrelevant. The plot and story line are so bad that it detracts from the continuity of the previous seasons. With the exception of \\"Razor\\", a real masterpiece of Sci-Fi television entertainment. This lack of effort from the writers, makes the purchase of this compilation a waist of money and time.
B0028K31CE|5.0|On this sad day, we celebrate the legacy of Michael Jackson as he is laid to rest. But on this day, we also celebrate the return of Maxwell a.k.a the keeper of the R&B flame.   What can be said about Maxwell that has NOT been said? For me (through his music) he made me believe in love and romance. He made me believe that not all young urban men are thugs (or thug wannabes). We made me believe that music can STILL inspire. It took him 8 years to return, but it has been worth the wait.  All the songs are great and intimate, but the best songs are:    Pretty Wings-love song about meeting the right person at the wrong time  Cold- rumored to be his 3rd single. This song really grooves and is very sexy.  Bad Habits- about really feeling a person to the point of addiction.  Love You- about wanting to become whatever the person you love want you to become.  Help Somebody- is one of Maxwell's first songs about helping mankind.    My last point about this album is its been a LONG time since we heard REAL instruments in music (especially in R&B). With this record, we get to hear REAL musicians....as I said earlier, we don't call Maxwell the keeper of the R&B flame for nothing.
0307270807|5.0|I have read a lot of books on the vietnam war, and this is not just the best book on the Vietnam war I've read, but simply the best book in my library (and my library is, ahem, extensive) - I have re-read it countless times. I had to read the 1 star reviews posted here as I'm incredulous that anyone couldn't love this book, I was releived to find  they seem to be written by either meatheads who want blood & guts-grunt perspective stories, or small minded college kids who think they know what good writing is because they've taken a couple of semesters of English Lit. The top Vietnam war books I've read are this one, Chickenhawk, A rumour of war, & To the Limit (air cav). Dispatches doesn't follow your standard linear storytelling, and some people may find that daunting, but it isn't trying to tell a linear story - it's mission is to get you to feel the war as it was to one man as he tries to understand it, to smell the death, cordite, hypocrisy & madness that was the Vietnam war, and to that end succeeds more than any book I know.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|A wonderful kids movie with a message for adults. It doesn't get any better than that. We've seen this movie 4 times now and, for different reasons, we still remain very impressed with the graphics, plot, everything. Picture quality is of course outstanding on a Toshiba 42\\" LCD, but it's the 5.1 audio that is truly awesome. Highly recommended!
B001NXDSLQ|1.0|I also have this movie in it's many various incarnations.  The Blu Ray 40th Anniversary, the original VHS and DVD release, as well as the director's cut DVD.  So I go and by this 40th Aniversary DVD for my office (which unfortunately does not have a Blu Ray player) specifically because I wanted the extra performances that are on the other 40th Anniversary discs.  Creedance, Johnny Winter, The Who, Canned Heat, Airplane, etc.  Wrong! Not here. Even the extra documentary footage that's on the other 40th Anniversary release of Wadleigh, Dale Bell, Scorsese and many others speaking on the events surrounding the filming of the movie is not here.  Just some cheesy Story of the Sixties film.  Totally dissapointed.  What really made me angry is that there's no disclaimer stating that there's huge differences between this \\"40th Anniversary Edition\\" DVD and the others that are available.  I just gave it away.
0440236738|4.0|As a Desperate Seeker of An Outstanding Mystery I found this pretty darn satisfying; a definite cut above most that I've read.  There was a lot of unpredictable twists and turns, and a few \\" oh my God\\" spots. The only thing that bothered me was the author's use of \\"you see, ....\\" when someone was explaining something to someone else, which seemed starkly out of place, false, unlike an actual conversation, kind of like a movie script from the 40's, but  that's my only complaint with semantics. There was a little too much repetition in explaining the plot at the end, but then, 415 pages is a little too much for me, and I'm usually ready to finish up before that.  All in all, a very enjoyable read.
0800177177|4.0|I have seen many Dracula films and none of them were as good as the book; this one comes close, but still it fails to be as good. Let me say first of all that I hated the fact that Mina is a reincarnation of Dracula's dead wife, and the fact that Mina and Dracula fall in love, and the film is way too obsessed with sex. But on the positive side the film does stay very close to Bram Stoker's novel, it has lots of scary parts in it as well as a lot of action at the end, the film is brilliantly directed and Gary Oldman's performance of Dracula is very good indeed. In all, this isn't a bad film, but it still could have been better. But I still think that you'll find it highly enjoyable. Highly recommended!
B000TDGGRY|3.0|Just got into reading J. Rollins, this is the third book I've read and I don't think I will continue to buy his books. It seems his plots are becoming more and more far-fetched with each new book. This is supposed to be an action-mystery book, but there are so many holes in his plot, it's almost unbearable to read.    And what's with the clean language?!? At least 100 people are murdered in full gore, yet the tough guys worst curse is \\"friggin\\"?!?    At around $6 his books are worth reading. Anything more and you are wasting money.
6305078181|4.0|This was the first Dracula film I saw. I saw this even before I read the book. And I loved it. True the film does not come close to the book, but it was still pretty damn good.<br /><br />Its Flaws:<br /><br />The film is not like the book, and I did not like the love story between Lucy and Dracula in it.<br /><br />Its Strengths:<br /><br />The plot is very good, the acting and directing is top-notch, it has some really good location scenes in it, it has the same eerie feel to it as the original 1931 film had, it has some good scary parts in it, the vampires are very scary with their red gleaming eyes and sharp fangs, Frank Langella's performances as the bloodthirsty Count is brilliant, it has a lot of good dialogue in it, and it has a good emotional and action-packed ending to it.<br /><br />The Plot:<br /><br />Dracula comes from Transylvania on a ship to England in order to feast on new blood. The crew of the ship is found dead. Dracula moves into Carfax Abbey nearby Dr. Seward's mental hospital. The Count seems like a very pleasent, although strange, neighbor. Liked by Dr. Seward, his daughter Lucy, and Lucy's friend Mina. Lucy's husband-to-be Jonathan Harker is a little jealous due to the fact that Lucy seems to be in love with the Count, but other than that he has no bad things to say about him either. But when Mina mysterious dies due to blood loss, her father Professor Van Helsing is called in, and soon he may be their only hope to save Lucy's life, stop his daughter Mina from feeding on the blood of the living, and destroy Dracula once and for all.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B002CGPI3O|1.0|As a long-time Moby fan, I was eager to hear where his talent would take him next. Alas, this release disappoints on nearly every level. Many of the tracks are boring, simplistic, repetitive, and shallow. They aren't even as good as many of Moby's previous B-sides, and instead feel like random sketches or thoughts. Honestly, some of the tracks sound like pale imitations and  build predictably in a kind of \\"now I'll turn on the drum track\\" manner. If you took away his trademark \\"slow-attack strings\\" sample and the repurposed gospel singing, you'd be left with nothing to remind you of Moby's earlier successes. As it is, vague memories of those gems is not enough to warrant the purchase of this album. Seriously...it made me question whether my initial respect for Moby was even justified. He has always owed a LOT to earlier electronic artists, almost copying them in some instances. Here, he tries to copy himself, with dismal results.
0312370849|3.0|I had high hopes, for this novel. The subject of the roundup, of French Jews, was excellent.  I felt the description of this episode, was well done. However, the story line ended up being a \\"soap.\\" to  me. I felt the main character, became, obsessed, w/ Sarah;to the detriment of her own family.  I give the novel A, for historical fact - C for plot
B0028T6XXY|5.0|This DVD has both great concert sequences and some insightful footage behind the scenes.

B000002G23|3.0|Certainly not every note of every song THE POLICE ever recorded. While it is fantastic to get FALLOUT and all the other obscure tracks digitally, I can't help but feel let down by all of the tracks that were NOT included in this set. Here's what I know for sure that has been released and is not on this set:<br /><br />TRUTH HITS EVERYBODY - REMAKE: b-side on some European singles of SYNCHRONICITY II. This is totally different than the original version -- slow and moody.<br /><br />DE DO DO DO, DE DA DA DA: versions sung in Japanese and Spanish.<br /><br />DON'T STAND SO CLOSE TO ME '86 (DANCE MIX)/DON'T STAND SO CLOSE TO ME (LIVE): both on the 12\\" vinyl single of DON'T STAND SO CLOSE TO ME '86.<br /><br />ROXANNE - BACKING TRACK ONLY: never heard this, but read that is was the b-side to some obscure single released in Latin America at one time.<br /><br />BEWITCHED: written by Andy Summers (probably during the ZENYATTA MONDATTA sessions) and featured in the video THE POLICE AROUND THE WORLD. This song was eventually released on Andy's second solo project with Robert Fripp, titled BEWITCHED.<br /><br />And while we're at it, how about including some of the VIDEO MAGIC session work with German keyboardist EBERHARD SCHOENER? THE POLICE were side men for Schoener in late 1977, and recorded a full length album with him several months BEFORE they recorded OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR. And it sound nothing at all like 'em.<br /><br />Plus there's Sting's single SPREAD A LITTLE HAPPINESS that was taken from the BRIMSTONE & TREACLE soundtrack, and it's b-side ONLY YOU.<br /><br />How about Stewart Copeland's original demo for DOES EVERYONE STARE? Or Copeland's alter ego KLARK KENT and the song that got them on TOP OF THE POPS as KLARK KENT before they appeared as THE POLICE, titled DON'T CARE? Anyone who was around for the early days of MTV will recall another KLARK KENT tune being used as the theme music for a show called I.R.S.'s THE CUTTING EDGE -- this was THEME FOR KINETIC RITUAL.<br /><br />If I didn't already know about these other lost tracks, I'd probably give the set five stars. The booklet and pictures are fantastic, and the set as it is should really be enough for the serious POLICE fan. But how can a company put out a statement that it contains every track, when it so  obviously doesn't?probably give the set five stars.

B000002H4Q|5.0|Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. First Cure CD I bought - mainly for Just Like Heaven. This to me is The Cure's erotic and sensual cd. I think Robert Smith does love songs like no other, it almost makes me cry.  I also like Robert Smith howling so of course I would love this CD. This CD sounds best at night on a cross country trip or in bed with your partner, try it!!    The Kiss still makes me laugh when I hear Robert screaming, I wish you were DEAD - a great tune!!  Love the exotics - Snakepit, If Only Tonight We Could Sleep, Like Cockatoos.   Love the Love songs - One More Time and A Thousand Hours  All I Want is a great animalistic tune and pretty much says it...  It is a long CD but love all the tunes on it.    If you like Erotic Cure, this one is for you!! Trust me!!
B00005QGAT|5.0|I did not purchase this off Amazon however, I remember my parents having this album back in the day. Mom had seems like 100 albums all in a cardboard box and you had to finger through them to get to Mike J. Take it out and unfold the album cover and they had a big photo of Mike J. put the album on the record player but if your needle was messed up, you taped a penny to the top of the arm to hold it on the album.<br /><br />Mike J. was a legend and he will be missed.<br /><br />If you are considering this 8 track /album /cassette /CD /IPOD Download then I suggest you purchase it. Years from now you can still \\"Live life off the wall!\\" I hope this helps!<br /><br />RIP MIKE J.!!!<br />NEOSOUL
B0000025D0|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out.  Didn't like it.  Put it on the shelf for about 4 months and then took it down and started listening to it.  The more I listened, the more I loved it. This is Bruce and the E Street Band at its best.  What I love about Bruce is his Vocals, his howling and his songwriting. Bruce howls on this record. The writing is beautiful and makes me remember why I loved Springsteen in the first place.  I have been playing this CD all summer and it is so America - the America I am proud to know and the America that is disappearing...In my opinion, Bruce's best album. Racing in the Streets my favorite, but Badlands, Promised Land, Prove It All Night, a howling Bruce on Something In The Night, Streets of Fire and the title track Darkness on the Edge of Town reign as some of his best...get it!!
1573226521|2.0|The Beach is a utopia gone awry story about a young British twenty something  named Richard, a typical elitist backpacker who travels to the lesser journeyed areas of the world basically to meet up with other elitist backpackers (usually of the Western persuasion) and one up each other with their travel scorecards.  He travels to Thailand and not only meets up with pretentious travelers but also encounters a strange man who leaves him a map of an island that is ultimately unknown to travelers.  This being an ideal travel spot for travelers like him, Richard and his new acquaintances travel to the mysterious island and come across a community of displaced travelers, like himself, that by all appearances seem to be living and idyllic existence.  Soon they come to find out that things usually never are as they appear.<br /><br />I was incredibly disappointed with this story.  I found myself confused, but not in a profound way.  I was simply confused by the story because of its lack of development.  From the first person narrative to the story itself, the writing wasn't thorough enough.  This is written in the first person narrative, so we only got to intimately know Richard, who seemed petty, lazy, and vapid, and Garland didn't bother to develop any of the other characters.  I didn't find myself convinced of the utopia the beach was supposed to be.  It just sounded like some cult.  All they did was work and get stoned.  All we had to rely on was the author's constant reminder that everybody liked doing manual labour and getting stoned all day.  Most of the conflict was brought on by Richard himself over very trivial issues.  I also found the macabre (particularly at the end) confusing.  There wasn't enough conflict or tension or enough build up for the violent, senseless ending.<br /><br />The overall problem I felt was that Garland seemed to rely on word of mouth to fill in the blanks of this lack luster thriller.  He knew it would be obviously compared to The Lord of the Flies and seemed to depend on the readers' knowledge of that novel to get them through this book.  That's the only thing that kept me on point with this book.and seemed to depend on the readers' knowledge of that novel to get them through this book.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|Ok, I have to admit that I didn't like this CD when I first heard it - except for Reckoner of course!!  And then I found Jigsaw, and then I found Weird Fishes, then I found House of Cards, and then All I Need. Well anyway, OK Computer was my favorite Radiohead record up until this one.  This surpassed that one a month ago.  I LOVE this cd and the more I listen to it the more I love it.  The only song I can't get into is Videotape, but it is short so I still play it.  Since I love every song on this CD, Videotape will fall into place just like the rest - it will just take time!!  Love Thom's voice on this CD and the band is tight!!  Great percussion and bass. Favorite Band!!

0061767581|3.0|I was so excited about this book, LA Candy, I really wanted to see Lauren Conrad prove that she was more than the TV show had portrayed her to be, but I see now that it is quite an accurate description. I opened the book and read the front flap and instantly realized this was an eye-roller.  It's written at about a 3rd grade reading level, and just as the reality TV show has no story arc, this book is more about watching the characters rather than experiencing a beginning, middle, and especially an end. Then I realized Conrad has a 3 book deal, however I don't think that is an excuse for not coming up with an ending to a novel.<br /><br />Having said all that, this book is a true guilty pleasure. I couldn't put it down once I started reading, and finished it in just a few hours of reading time.  It's easy and fun and very light summer reading.  I found it interesting to see the Reality TV process from the other side, but don't try to look for The Hills characters in the book, it will be just more confusing since I don't remember ANY of these characters in the show, especially Scarlett, the \\"un-relatable dark-haired exotic beauty who is smarter than everyone at U.S.C.\\"... who the heck was that?<br /><br />Short Version: Lauren isn't doing anything to prove her intelligence as anything different from the portrayal on MTV, but LA Candy is just as fun as an episode of The Hills.
B00005NB8K|5.0|Hello there,<br /><br />THE FILM THAT BLEW THE COVER OF THE LEGEND THAT IS THE DOORS<br /><br />The Doors revokes the worldwide interest of shamanism and the protection of the environment against illegal construction corporate activities and still continues to leave the lives of whoever watch it changed forever.<br />Watching the Doors is beyound reading the works of Bob Frizzel or Drunvalo Melchizedek or having a chat with Stewart Swerdlow.<br />The film touches the heart of the entire population on this planet as it continues to be watched - this time by myself , yesterday and being finished today. Jim Moors died happy - looking towards the limit of the horizon , having freed himself finally from his mortal body , in the year 1971. He was a first class self - initiated shaman who followed the Native American Tradition , according to Stone , and not Satanism , as portrayed in the rock'n roll classic documentary Hell's Bells.<br />So obsessed with freeing his soul from his mortal body did Jim Morrison become that nothing else mattered , sometimes not even 'the one'or his wife.<br />Jim Morrison taught people that in order to overcome fear you must confront it - literally. He was totally unafraid of fame and fortune and definately did not literally believe in Satan. He believed instead , according to Stone , in the Great Spirit being nature itself and loved the desert - out there , like Charles Manson , Jim Morrison felt restful and at peace and at one with his heart and the girl he loved who would grow up and become one of the most famous women of all time , who would have even silent wannabes wanting to be like her among many of America's leading politicians , such as Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton , who must have secretly desired to be wives of Jim Morrison in some of their sickest , sexcual fantasies which can only be defined as normal due to the spirit of the times.<br />And what's wrong with any woman wanting to be the wife of a famous rock star? What Jim Morrison exposed was the body of our once inner policeman , who is slowly being killed and whose body is still in the process of being processed. That is what he means when he says that most of us are in fact slaves. I do not even allow myself to speak profanely here when I state that , so I'll leave the spirit of Jim Morrison to once again remind us of the importance of NOT BEING SLAVES to anyone , even ourselves. But Jim Morrison ended up being a slave to the drugs that he was so quick to get addicted to , and freed himself from his drug slavery in the end , fearlessly , calmly , rationally , irrationally , spatially , happily , sexually , fantastically , and quite honestly brilliantly.<br />He became one of history's greatest rock stars , and as Michael Jackson died , so would his generation be resurrected. Finally Jim Morrison roams free in the spirit world - let's hope he does not end up in a place belonging to the mind of such people as Peggy Kane when it comes to talk about his hopefully happy afterlife. The film explodes the senses with it's surreal lack of special effects , and bestows upon the entire population of the people of the United States a form of nakedness and self - exposure which a worker in the black project programmes can only dream of. Jim Marrison may have been a black tulip that got eaten by drugs - but in the end he defeated his drug addiction doing it the only way he thought appropriate at that time.<br />He wanted to defy death , and sometimes wondered if he could defy his own fame. He believed in life , liberty , hope , love , hate , anything a man can believe in - and loved his wife and children more than anyone and anything. He was a man who had it all , and got it all in the end , got bored by it , and wanted to explore more. For the spirit of the personality that was Jim Morrison still lives on to this day. Therefore I say that this is without doupt , Oliver Stone's best film. Everything is changing now as our society chooses to abandonzealous materialism , and all kinds of extreme forms of variations of religions , and new and more forgiving varieties of spirituality are constructed , out of the ashes of the less forgiving cults.<br />Everything is changed in the mind of the viewer of this film - it quite literally tunes you in , then drops you out and that with more sheer quality of surreal realism than anything Videodrome by David Chronenberg had ever attempted to do , an equally fascinating and good film to watch nonetheless. This is one of a kind of a movie - and there aren't that many musical films I've seen. Way to go Oliver Stone , still receiving honest and positive criticism on this brilliant work of genius whose immortal spirit can never be defeated , and way to go for Val Kilmer.<br />This is the best EVER movie I've ever seen starring him.ds of extreme forms of variations of religions , and new and more forgiving varieties of spirituality are constructed , out of the ashes of the less forgiving cults.

0307266303|3.0|It's not that you aren't warned by the title of this book: three superlatives in one sentence should tip you off that there is a lot of hyperbole in this book.    \\"Born to Run\\" is an entertaining read, as long as you don't mind that a lot of the facts and characters are exaggerated. It's kind of funny to read that American River 50m is a \\"hot, hilly, and hazardous cross-country ramble\\" when in fact the race is one of the easiest 50m races in the country: most of the course is flat and run on a bike path! Also, the Leadville 100m raceis hardly the beast it sounds like: it's not even in the top ten hardest 100m races.      What bothers me more than these embellishments is the depiction of ultrarunners as a bunch of fringe folks or freaks. I'm an ultrarunner myself and have run numerous 50m and 100m races.  The overwhelming majority of ultrarunners are perfectly well adjusted people who lead normal lives, and this book does a real disservice to them. Depicting ultrarunners and their accomplishments in a breathless and exaggerated tone also undermines the central argument of the book, i.e., that running long distances is something normal that humans are well adapted to do.    This brings me back to the main message of the book, which makes the book worth reading. The sections on the evolution of humans and the science of running are quite interesting and compelling. Focus on those and read the rest with a grain of salt!    One more thing. If you go to Luis Escobar's site [...] and scroll half way down you can see what looks to be the non-photoshopped version of the cover image, along with photos of the Copper Canyon race described in the book (apparently it was 47m and not 50m like the book says. Details, details ...).

B0028K31CE|5.0|When you hear the name Maxwell you automatically think of one thing... smooth mellow grooves that please the ear and make you want for more. But when I think of Maxwell something else comes to mind. I think of his ability to make me dream. To dream and see that there is in fact love and real music out there. That is how his music has forever reached me. I stop and listen to a sound, a note, a whisper of him and I dream and imagine the love I know is there.     I've waited patiently... well almost patiently... for eight year for a chance to dream again. I chance to fall into the music and soak up the love, hope, and dream ladened deep within each melody. Blacksummer'snight has given me a reason to dream again. Bad Habits, Pretty Wings, Cold are amazing songs but the beauty and yet simplicity of Playing Possum sealed the deal for me. This cd like his many others will stay on repeat.     What perhaps is the best thing about this new music from Maxwell is it has reopened my eyes to the beauty, talent, and immense musicality of his previous work. I grooved to Blacksummer'snight from the moment I received in the mail and as I listend and grooved more my mind drifted back to Urban Hang Suite, MTV Unplugged, Embrya, and Now and I dove in the melodies and my dreams are now in abundance. Thank you Maxwell and I await the next installment.
1593081251|4.0|Not as good as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" of the same author, although some chapters are brilliant. Particularly good are those where Jane Austin applying her great satirical talent. I liked very much how she painted the character of John Dashwood: soft but very biting image of the selfish and greedy fellow. Balance of judgment and passion - dilemma as old as Seneca writing and beyond - revealed in this novel slightly in obsolete form, but essence is the same: you suffer more when submit to passions, but who can live by the rule of judgment only?
1416550542|4.0|This was my first book read on my kindle.I enjoyed the book very much and I think reading it on the kindle made it more enjoyable. I read this book in 3 days hated to put it down. Once again I've lost my friends and must find a book full of new friends. I'm excited to find the next good book.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|The day after I saw this show in the Hollywood Bowl, I bought this CD.  It is amazing how good this show was and this CD is!  My only complaint, and it is really minor is that the LA show had two backup singers which are not on the NY show.  They are especially missed on Voodoo Chile.  But, that aside, Clapton on the guitar and Winwood on the keyboards...what more could you want?<br /><br />In today's music environment, it is hard to believe that this music was made with just five people!  There is no overdubbing, there was no lip synching and this is the way it should be.
B0025T65GC|5.0|I had a major musical identity crisis growing up, especially when it came to picking a band or person I really liked.  Devin Townsend has been the person that stands out above of anything else I have listened to.  Every album he does is different, but he keeps his Devy signature there.  Ki without a doubt is no different, being the album to date that is way different than anything else he has ever done, it proves that Devin Townsend is one of the few people out there that creates music that is original and new every time a new album is released unlike other bands that fall into the same genre with Devin.    Ki is a first of four albums under 'The Devin Townsend Project' plus this is first album being sober and it's very noticeable.  His style has obviously changed, plus the clean tone guitar is something that gives the album it's own stand alone sound.  The album plays on self control, something that Devin himself has learn and explained in his radio interview, every time you think this record will lose its composure, it takes a breath and let's it go.  But there are some very 'chill' songs on the record like \\"Terminal\\" \\"Ain't Never Gonna Win\\" \\"Winter\\" and \\"Lady Helen\\" that are soothing enough to make you doze off while you listen.    The record itself can leave you hanging if you are looking for something that will rock out at some point, because it won't.  Ki is instead an introduction to what Devin has now become, a sober and brilliant artist with a whole new side to show us.  If you have been listening to Devin over the years, you will appreciate this album for what it is.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Great Stuff! A fun movie; impressive in scope, pretty thoughtful for a comic book movie. I never read the comic (I have it sitting on a shelf) and probably won't after seeing the flick. Not for the kiddies, take the R-rating seriously.
B00006GEMA|5.0|As a guy who was a high school sophomore when the Beatles burst on the scene in winter '64, and saw the subsequent rebirth of rock & roll, I was fascinated by the completeness of this look at the guys, all the way from the sheer exuberance of \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" to the resignation of \\"Let It Be.\\"    The Beatles were the background music of the mid-late '60s, and as such, were the major rock music contributors of the time.    The most surprising thing was the fact that Paul and Yoko were able to come to an agreement that allowed the surviving Beatles to record \\"with\\" John on two songs he'd done. Also, although George was obviously less eager for the reunion, he \\"took one for the team,\\" and possibly for his \\"big brother,\\" John.     My own reactions also surprised me: I enjoyed the first half and a bit more of the episodes; the 2nd half became increasingly disappointing as everything, including their friendships, came apart.    (Apparently, Gangstalawyer (redundant?) has musical preferences limited strictly to pure classical. Nothing wrong with that, but he should limit his criticisms to his own areas of expertise.)    All in all, this collection is right now the definitive history of the biggest rock band in history, and deserves its place in musical history.
B001KZI2WW|5.0|My girlfriend and I were at a party and a friend of ours had these on.  He said they were \\"the most comfortable shoes he ever owned...\\"  How many times have we all heard that line.  Anyway I really liked the style and had some other crocs already so I figured I would give them a try.  I usually wear a size 14 in tennis shoes, so I was kind of bummed when I found out that they only went up to a size 13 even on [...].  I really wanted to get a pair so I called and the lady I spoke with said that their \\"13\\" runs like a normal \\"14,\\" so I figured what the heck, I can always send them back.  They fit perfect!  I was so excited when I tried them on and they slid right on and I had plenty of room.  Mind you, this was without socks, but who is going to wear socks with these anyway?  Long story short, I am now the person declaring these as \\"the most comfortable shoes ever...\\"  So much so that we got my girlfriend's father a pair for father's day!  They have all of the comfort of the standard crocs with the style of a nice loafer, the perfect loafer!
1400049628|5.0|This book is fun and treats a zombie invasion like a plausibe event that one may have to react to some day. I recommend it for Zombie movie buffs!
B000H5TVJY|3.0|First off, American Psycho is one of my favorite movies of all time. It rocked my world the first time I saw it and I've probably seen the thing 100+ times. Mary Harron's take on Bret Easton Ellis's masterpiece is amazing, and Christian Bale brings the character of Patrick Bateman to life like none other. The brutal acts juxtaposed with Patrick's cool nonchalance is profoundly disturbing and creepy. If you haven't seen the movie, buy it at once.<br /><br />As far as the Blu Ray version goes? Skip it. The intro with the white background looks absolutely horrible on Blu Ray. In fact, I put my old DVD copy in just to see the difference and I think the original upscaled DVD looks better on my PS3. There are no special features on the Blu Ray worth mentioning. Save yourself the trouble and get the DVD version instead.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD!  Amazing dancing, singing, and a great assortment of favorite Michael Jackson hits.  Great use of illusion throughout the show with a great stunt at the closer :)  I noticed there are complaints about the amount of audience shots shown, including way too many fainting and getting carted off by paramedics.  I agree with this, but luckily after the first few songs that dies way down (as does the crotch grabbing that annoys some people), but there is another resurgence of fainters during Man in the Mirror at the end.  Also I'm surprised how many people said there was lip syncing, to the point where I was expecting most of the show would be that way.  However, the only song that seemed there was lip syncing was Thriller, and that was due to the fact he wears a wolf mask half way through I'd imagine!  Possibly there were a couple more, but for the most part it was clearly live singing and he was FANTASTIC!  I was about to list my favorite moments, but I realized I'd have to list half the set list!!  HIGHLY recommended, as Michael Jackson was an amazing performer who will be very missed!
B00164KYV4|3.0|Good movie, but I expected more from such a stellar cast.  So, I was disappointed.  Good, but not as good as I expected.
032147404X|4.0|A wonderful book. It is written in such simple language but at the same time covers all aspects of photography in detail. Scott has a wicked sense of humour as well which makes for great reading.
0140067477|5.0|I've been wanting to read this book for such a long time, but not because of an interest in Taoism. I was intrigued by the concept that Winnie the Pooh could teach people academic concepts. It seemed like such a cute novel idea. I wasn't certain if I even took the idea seriously, but after reading the book not only have I learned about the basic concepts of Taoism, but I was taken for a joyous ride.<br /><br />What was amazing about this book is that it teaches you the principles of Taoism by stating full well it will not be a book of stuffy academic knowledge. Instead Pooh and his friends interrupt the book and you read about their adventures and tales that highlight some of the major concepts of Taoism. It's written in such a fluid way that the reader can not really know when the author stops talking and when the beloved characters of Piglet, Pooh, Eeyore and others take over.<br /><br />The book does not aim to be pretentious or horde this philosophy as the only correct philosophy. Instead, we're introduced to Taoism shown how the concepts work in all of our lives-especially Pooh and friends, and told that understanding certain jargon isn't essential to being a Taoist expert. As long as we practice the concepts and ideals we are living a Taoist lifestyle.<br /><br />The book is a wonderful mixture of simplicity and wisdom. The fact that Hoff is able to replicate Pooh's voice perfectly only adds to the enchanting aspect of this book. This should be a must read for anyone interested in Taoism, without being bogged down with extra information and those who want to enjoy the simple joys of life.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|Ok I know that this CD has gotten a lot of negative press and my first reaction to this cd was just that--negative.  But like so much of what Chris Cornell has done with the likes of Soundgarden, Audioslave and in his solo career, one has to just give the music a chance and behold the greatness of it unfolds.  Such is the case with this cd.  Sure the great vocals are there as always (I'm sorry, but no one in the history rock has a better voice that Chris Cornell, apologies to Paul Rodgers and many others), but what is also there are really, really catchy songs. Songs that reveal more and more each time they are played; songs that have one tapping one's toes and singing along, and assuming I'm not in the car, dancing right along (my two young sons loving singing along as well).  I think it took a lot of courage for Cornell to step out of the traditional rock genre to do this cd and I for one am glad he did.
B0026J8LHM|3.0|I've listened to these guys from the get go and have enjoyed all of their releases over the years. I'd say that, for the most part they have been pretty consistent when it comes to putting out good quality stuff. This release follows in that vain as well as theirs nothing on here that can be considered filler or a dud in any way.<br /><br />However to me, it's all starting to sound the same? I'm not complaining here, just stating my opinion. Yes the tunes are good, but they really don't really move you like Images and Words did way back when. Again it's not a bad release by any stretch and it's typical DT material. Musicianship is again, top notch and everyone contributes to the overall vibe just like they always have. I'm not sure I like the death metal vocals they are tossing in from time to time on the last two release though. Are they trying to cash in on the popularity of that style that's in right now? To me it just doesn't work with this band and I wish they'd knock that off as it takes away from the overall feel of the tune.<br /><br />So if you still love Dream Theater as I do, go pick this CD up as it's worth the price of admission. However, don't expect to be blown away by it. It's a good listen, nothing more.
B001SN78JO|4.0|I thought this was a really decent film! Jim Carrey is always hilarious. This time, he plays a man named Carl Allen who has been through a bad divorce and shuts himself off from the world. When a friend invites him to a \\"Yes!\\" self-improvement seminar, Carl must say 'yes' to everything, including giving a ride and some money to a bum, letting his elderly landlady give him oral sex, learning a different language, playing guitar, and joins a Persian dating site. He soon meets Allison a woman who is in charge of a jogging club, and sings in a band. Carl slowly begins to fall in love with her. I highly recommend YES MAN!!!
B001PPLIEG|2.0|After the excellent Casino Royale, the producers of Bond seemed to have forgotten why they had to restart their ailing franchise in the first place. This film makes many of the mistakes the old film series made.<br />The first would be using Ian Fleming's work in name only and discarding the content of his books. Although \\"Quantum of Solace\\" the short story is about Bond's conversation with a British Governor regarding a party guest and the collapse of her marriage, hardly fodder for an action movie, there is reference to Bond's mission just prior to his meeting with the governor which could have been used in the film. If the film makers didn't want to use anything from Ian Fleming's story, why name the film after the story in the first place? It's not like people were crying out\\"when will we ever see Quantum of Solace on the silver screen?\\".<br /><br />Ian Fleming's work is a gold mine and many of his books were not adapted faithfully at all and could be filmed anew and offer audiences something fresh. Moonraker, The Spy Who Loved Me, You Only Live Twice, The Man with The Golden Gun, A View to a Kill and Octopussy were all films which borrowed the name of the book but have completely different plots, characters...everything. Why not adapt these stories and give Bond's new adventures the same heart which made Casino Royale such a success?<br />Not to mention the fact that Live and Let Die, which was made into the awful Roger Moore film, is the second Bond Novel in the series and ripe for a remake.<br /><br />Another minor complaint would be (*****SPOILER********** )killing off Mathis, the French Intelligence man from \\"Royale\\". He an integral part of the Bond books and appeared in many of the novels, so why kill him off pointlessly and diverge even further from Fleming work in future films(******END OF SPOILER).<br /><br />There is also a lingering problem of casting Judy Dench as M. This is a mistake from the last movie which carries over here. Don't misunderstand; Judy Dench is fine in the role, but the M of the novels is Bond's father figure who condones his methods and stands behind him on his missions. Judy Dench's M is the new director who thinks Bond is a relic of older times. In other words her character comes LATER in the Bond time line, essentially throwing a monkey wrench in his professional life.<br />Her casting is also problematic as it serves as a tie to the old movies. This would be like recasting Michael Keaton in the role of Batman in the recent Dark Knight or Batman Begins. It works against the idea of starting fresh.<br />These are minor problems compared to the fact that the movie loses it's way at mid point and just doesn't deliver on the promise of the first film. The villain is boring and so is much of the action. By the time Bond is flying around South America I found myself wondering how much longer I had to endure this film. A bad sign for a Bond movie.<br /><br />Eon Productions should look at the recent Batman films to see how to succesessfully relaunch a franchise; stick to the source material and you can't go wrong.le, but the M of the novels is Bond's father figure who condones his methods and stands behind him on his missions.

0385341008|4.0|This book, written in epistolary style, transports the reader to  post-WWII Britain, a place of resilience and hope in the face of massive devastation. Juliet, a feisty, 32-year-old writer, finds herself serendipitously connected with an eclectic band of survivors on the island of Guernsey, and decides to write a book about how reading helped them survive the German occupation. The characters are beautifully drawn and deeply endearing, the beautiful island of Guernsey comes to life in Juliet's letters, the story moves along at a quick clip, and if the outcome seems a little predictable, it's only because we've read this story before: it's Pride and Prejudice, redux. A wonderful, lively read.

B00139XZF4|5.0|I can't believe this movie didn't do better in the box office.  I'm just thinking it wasn't marketed right, because I remember seeing the posters, but not really knowing what it was.  Plus, I don't think the book is as widely known like the Lord of the Rings movies.  Anyway, I got the movie and just finished watching it.  SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOODD.  Don't let the religious fanatics let you think this is a anti-religion movie.  It isn't.  It's a wonderful family movie, with great actors and a strong story.  I really hope they make the two sequels they were planning on making.  GET THIS MOVIE!!
0786838655|5.0|A group of nine and ten year old boys say...  It's the best book in the world or even the universe.  Greek mythology is cool and there is a bunch of mythology in this book.  I give Rick Riordan the Newberry award for this book because he knows how to make kids our age laugh.  I hope the series goes on for eternity like the Greek Gods.
B000002A33|5.0|I love grunge (AIC, Soundgarden, Nirvana, etc), but had never owned a Screaming Trees CD. They have a unique version of grunge. The vocals are not as raw as the other Seattle bands; they come off more calmly expressive. The music is great and Lanigan's voc's give them an origional groove. Check out the song samples.

B00192KCQ0|3.0|Ever since Metallica's famous 1991 Black Album fans have been waiting for a truly worthy follow-up. Load and Reload had a few decent songs, Garage Inc. was good, but not a real album, and St. Anger was complete steaming pile of absolute garbage. That being said, Metallica finally listened to their fans and released their most straight forward metal album in 17 years. To me this album sounds like And Justice For All in terms of the length and overall complexity of the musical arrangements, except for the solos. The lyrics unfortunately sound like St. Anger in some parts and sound just plain forced at others. For those of you who are excited to hear that Kirk is playing solos on this record: yes he is, but almost all of them suck. I've always felt that Hammett was and is completely overrated as a soloist; Hetfield is amazing and the true guitar voice in Metallica. Kirk just can't seem to stay away from his wah-wah pedal; he uses it on nearly every solo. The solos are completely forgetful and uninspiring. There are some really good songs on this record, but there's also some filler - some of the songs are just too long for no reason. The records real downfall is the atrocious mixing job. There's no sonic depth in the mix; just one very loud wall of sound - there's no breathing room. Overall, if you're a Metallica fan whos been waiting for them to release a true metal album, this is the closest you're gonna get, and it's pretty good, just not great.

B001KZBK76|4.0|I really like Circus it was out awhile before I finally purchased it, but it is great. The guys have really grown since the early days, and when I heard their last record \\"Beautiful World\\" I was surprised how good they could really sound without Robbie Williams but now in fact it's like Robbie who? the guys all sing now and I especially like Gary and Howard on lead together very Lennon and McCartney to me. This CD flows better as a whole then just the singles so just put it on and let it play from start to finish.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|We missed the movie when it came out, so when I had the opportunity to purchase the DVD, and after reading previous reviews, we purchased it.  We are not disappointed!  In as much as we have enjoyed the theatre production and the original music, the movie version just adds so much more with visuals both virtual and actual settings.  The actors are excellent and the music is right up to the theatre achievements.  Well done by all.

This was the first cure album I bought about 20 years ago, so it has a special place in my heart.  It´s one of my all time cure favorites, in my opinion, five stars!!!!!!
B001CQONKY|5.0|Did not disappoint.  Haven't viewed them all but great so far.  You can watch this having not seen all the others previously but it does have \\"aha\\" moments linking back to previous episodes.<br /><br />Grissom makes the show for me so not really looking forward to upcoming episodes when he leaves...<br /><br />Thoroughly good viewing.

B00164KYV4|4.0|I was not into seeing this film, but I watched it for free. This movie was not the romantic comedy I was expecting. It was extremely blunt about the problems and expectations men and, especially, women have when it comes to dating. Blunt to the point where you cringe for the characters, but the information for these people is necessary. It is the only way they can grow and gain the ability to be in a real relationship. That being said it did have some truly funny parts that blended into the movie perfectly.     The actors were all great, none more so than Ginnifer Goodwin. She is a lovable gal, who unfortunately lives in the dark when it comes to guys. And shock of all shocks, my favorite guy in this movie is Ben Affleck. (I despise this man as an actor, so for me this is huge.)    The only problem is I feel like the movie almost excuses certain characters for unacceptable behavior. (Minor SPOILER) The cheaters seem let off the hook instead of reprimanded. I don't care what society we live in or what year it is, cheating is always wrong!    Overall, I would recommend this movie, and you do not know how much this goes against my regular movie-going preferences.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|This season is just as good as season 1 and 2. I think I ended up watching all of the episodes within 2-3 days from the video on deman. Definitly keeps you hooked into the story to see what happens next. Can't wait for season 4!

0792833279|4.0|It's had to say if Travolta was just caught up in the idea of being a gangster when he signed on for this movie but for whatever reason, this is one to add to the collection if you are a fan.    Both a comedy and a kinda-drama, Get Shorty is about a Mobster debt collector who finds himself in Hollywood to collect on a debt.  His affinity for motion pictures gets him involved in a deal that requires some finess to pull off.    Good stuff all around...

B002APNQEU|5.0|Whitesnake had just come off the major mainstream success of there 1987 album and were riding the storm of fame and glory. It was no easy task for them to follow-up with a as good or better album. They Brought In Super Guitar Hero/Legend: \\"Steve Vai\\" which just made things a whole lot wicked, as he ended up recording all guitar parts on the album, which really gives the album a spark that the 1987 album didn't have (as great as that album was)    As For The Songs: they're all fantastic, none of them miss, they're all straight shooters and are filled with tons (and i mean tons) of ear candy, courtesy of \\"Steve Vai\\". The Band sounds tight and i never believed the others who said that Steve didn't fit...although i understand there argument.    The Remastering On Here Is A Major, Major Contribution To Making The Record Shine Like Never Before, The Package Is Awesome Too. This Is A Must Have For Any Whitesnake Or \\"Steve Vai\\" Fan...I've Found Myself Listening To This Remaster Every Single Day In It's Entirety...Simply Brilliant.

Sorry, that's my feeling on it.  A waste of my money.  I was interested in reading about it, so i finished the book.  Then gave it away.

The only thing I can say is that in order for you to believe that it is great you must read it.<br />The only thing I can say to Sarah Waters is that she left me wanting to know more about these two lovely women. The moment it ends you want more.

Irony and sarcasm appear, and I appreciate that since it's my favorite form of humor. If your child is a reluctant reader, the large font and frequent graphics may make the text less intimidating. There is also plenty of material to talk about with your kids. Just this evening, we talked about what a New Years' Resolution was and what some common resolutions are. There are lots of these discussions waiting for you and your kids if you read this book together.

0385737424|5.0|This is the author's second novel, according to the blurb inside the book, and judging by this, she has a brilliant career ahead of her in children's fiction.  This is a smart, fun read that takes its audience seriously and never talks down to them.  The main character, a 6th grade girl named Miranda, is a charming and sympathetic figure.  The reader will be rooting for her and her friends throughout the book.  The intelligent reader will solve the mystery just before Miranda does, but the conclusion is satisfying, nonetheless.    Other reviewers have done a good job of describing the plot, so I won't rehash that here.  This book will probably be marketed primarily to junior high aged girls.  However, as an adult male who thoroughly enjoyed it, I predict it will become a classic with boys and girls of all ages.
