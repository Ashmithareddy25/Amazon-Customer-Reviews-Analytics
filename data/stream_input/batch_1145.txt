B002NXSRX4|1.0|It's like having the most amazing memories of childhood ripped from your conscience. Ground-up, from the original writers to the actors and director; all involved in this atrocity should banned from even discussing movies. This review doesn't even scratch the surface of my true feelings. Any person or entity that profited from this plague of a movie should donate every dollar to charity.

1601252463|5.0|This book meshes perfectly with the Core Rule book, adding fresh options for your characters. I like that you can substitute traits in each race, and the option to add additional traits really lets you make a character more nuanced and unique. The new base classes are original, worthwhile, and each goes up to level 20. There are also alternate builds for the core classes. The prestige classes are also well done and worthy of consideration alongside those from the core book.<br /><br />There are 163 new feats: 77 are combat feats, 69 are general feats, 14 are metamagic feats, and 11 are teamwork feats. There is a chapter for new equipment and a chapter with 262 new spells. The chapter on new magic items ranges from weapons and armor to minor and major artifacts. Chapter 8 introduces rules for new combat maneuvers, Hero Points, and additional character creation traits.

B0034YXY5C|3.0|My first thought when setting out to write this review was, 'Hmmm, I wonder how many irrelevant and obscure titles I can work into the review, that may or may not shed some light on the subject matter at hand?'<br /><br />I am a fairly well-read person (I am told I am too modest, and that I qualify as a very well read person, but I don't want to claim too much, lest some diabolic force leap forward to claim me back for my sin of pride, a particularly bad thing for those of holy orders, as every guide and advice to the priestly states since the days of Irenaeus). But I digress.<br /><br />But this is in keeping with the flavour of the novel. Unless you like digression, stay far away (run, don't walk!) from this novel. But, if you go in for the seemingly endless, barely understandable and eventually irrelevant, then by all means, this is the book for you.<br /><br />I would not have read this book but for the urgings of friends who were similarly reading this, and wanted to compare notes. Thanks, guys!<br /><br />Now, I must hasten to add at this point, I did find myself enjoying the book several times. I don't mind the digressions, but I found the attempts (subtle but there) to equate Corso with a Holmesian character unconvincing (and the attempts were subtle enough that Perez-Reverte could claim they aren't actually there). Apart from Holmes, he ignores most of English literature--when he talks of those who wrote in serial form, i.e, Stendahl et alia, he neglects those such as Dickens.<br /><br />I would love to have the card catalogue Perez-Reverte was sitting next to as he wrote this; perhaps he used Amazon.com and other internet searching to add that final irrelevant entry in each of the listings of books.<br /><br />I am a bibliophile. I sit in a room, such as Perez-Reverte describes in several places, where shelves sag on walls groaning from the strain of heavy books, heavy in content as well as mass weight. I have several such rooms in my home. But I couldn't quite find the same love of books in this book, where sometimes bibliophilia was a fetish, and other times a useless detail.<br /><br />Basic plot--is it a murder or is it a suicide? What does the manuscript have to do with it? Dumas (who wrote, among other things, the stories involving the Musketeers) is seemingly at the centre of things, along with a possibly-phoney book of occult forbidden knowledge, for which men will die (obviously) or kill. There is diabolic force at work, maybe. Corso is the rare-books expert called in to investigate the case, who doesn't always like the role of policeman.<br /><br />Perez-Reverte seems intent on impressing us with his erudition in the field of literature and continental travel. It would be impressive if it were consistent and organised along better lines, and woven into a story where such details made a contribution. This book, as a mystery, fails to deliver because it both gives more information than is necessary (which can be an effective device, forcing the reader to separate 'the wheat from the chaff', or figure out which strands to follow; sadly, that is not the case here) and insufficient information in the strands which count to allow the reader to 'figure it out' (another sin, often difficult to avoid when one is trying for a 'complex' novel; even Conan Doyle frequently failed on this point).<br /><br />In all, this is an inventive idea, with interesting character formation; for some reason, neither the story nor the characters get developed sufficiently (either in size or direction) to make this a first-class novel.<br /><br />The New York Daily News described this book as 'A cross between Umberto Eco and Anne Rice' (Eco is very prominent here, as Perez-Reverte is obviously trying to emulate and cash in on Eco's prominence in the richer-and-book-purchasing English-speaking world). The New Yorker gets even more, well, New-Yorker-ish: 'A noir metafiction [please someone, tell me just what that means, in English??] Even a reader armed with a Latin dictionary and a copy of The Three Musketeers cannot anticipate the thrilling twists of this stylish, Escher-like mystery.'<br /><br />Perhaps one of the reasons one cannot anticipate 'the thrilling twists' is the inconsistency in the novel? Just a thought.<br /><br />Escher-like...well, yes, you read one thing and it turns out to be another (for instance, I thought I was reading a great novel, and it turned out to be...)<br /><br />No, that is unfair. It is worth reading, but not devoting much time toward. Use as a diversion, not a devotional. I won't spoil the ending for you. I don't like it when others do that for me. You'll have to suffer as I and my fellow readers did to find out. You may love it! You may despise it!

B000SXBOP4|1.0|It's not uncommon to see this album frequent \\"best of\\" lists, so as an entertainment critic and music junkie, I took it upon myself to give it a listen. I know Bowie's \\"Let's Dance\\" and remember him in an 80s Disney movie, but here is what propelled him into stardom.<br /><br />Uh, why?<br /><br />I'm sure David Bowie was super cool in 1972. Whacky guy in crazy costumes! Songs about a band from space! Woah! However, this album is like a giant 1990's cellphone; interesting at the time but now we snicker at them as we browse the Internet on our iPhones. The glam rock idea has been greatly improved upon; look no further than The Darkness, Adam Lambert & Semi-Precious Weapons for proof. Heck, even Lady Gaga's outlandish persona (and fantastic songs) would make Ziggy green with envy. Ditch this silly ancient artifact.
0756404738|5.0|First off; don't even think of reading The Wise Man's Fear if you haven't read The Name of the Wind yet. You'd cheating yourself out of a fantastic read.    I pre-ordered The Wise Man's Fear so I could stop worrying when it would arrive. When it arrived, I delighted in reading it slowly. I really enjoy the style of the writing, the depth of the characterizations, the sensibility that the story is the journey not the destination, and the unpredictable pacing of plot events versus character development has an authenticity to it.    I have to respectfully disagree with anyone who gives it less than 5 stars. That said; I completely agree with those who feel Rothfuss has left too many questions and events for book 3. I do not feel the story arc feels 66% complete, or that even 25% of the exposition in book 1 was addressed. But that is a matter to review in book 3; this was a fun book to read.    For the record: I love The Name of the Wind. Kvothe is the character I'ved been awaiting for decades. I'm all about the exposition in fantasy fiction, so I'm not overly concerned that The Wise Man's Fear is not \\"as good\\" as The Name of the Wind. I'm glad Rothfuss chose to write a trilogy from the outset; I love the device of first person narrative with some of the key events already advertised and the manageable number of characters. I realize that creating a rich fantasy fiction world takes a lot of effort, but there are far too many \\"epics\\" in fantasy fiction today.    I hope that Rothfuss will have the discipline to finish the story in book 3 rather than setting up a second trilogy or series, which no doubt his publisher strongly desires. How he will manage to address all those plot elements while still maintaining the character development I've so greatly enjoyed in a volume of reasonable length will be wondrous to behold. If book 3 concludes Kvothe's narrative history to set up subsequent books about the events in the \\"present\\" then Kvothe must die to satisfy the premise ofbook 1 in my opinion. I stand ready to be awed.
B000W1W9EW|2.0|The first time I heard the title track in a car commercial, I thought \\"...why?\\". It's certainly no way to keep a viewer's attention, it'll just make them go to sleep. Curious to see what \\"artist\\" was responsible for such a terrible song, I was surprised to see he actually had a cult following. Oh, you crazy kids.<br /><br />Music \\"critics\\" (or hipsters on RateYourMusic, Pitchfork, etc) will tell you that Nick Drake was a terribly depressed young man who had no commercial success in his short life, and somehow that makes his music meaningful. It doesn't. This album is nothing more than a collection of very short songs with whispered vocals and acoustic guitar strumming. That's it. The lyrics are insipid garbage like \\"pink moon stands soooo tall\\". It doesn't matter, though, since they're mumbled. So you're really just left with ~20 minutes of acoustic noodling. Thankfully, singer-songwriters' ability has evolved wonderfully since this album's release, for proof I advise everyone to listen to the likes of Goo Goo Dolls, Train, Counting Crows & Matchbox Twenty. Despite the disgust I feel for Mr. Drake's music, I do appreciate him for being an emo prototype; I feel as if we would not have the \\"angsty suburban kid\\" bands without him, and for that I award this album two stars instead of the intended lone star.
1423101499|5.0|If you think that The Battle of the Labyrinth doesn't have action and adventure then think again. It has action and adventure beyond belief. The action in this book is suspenseful because they have to find Daedalus who has trapped himself in the Labyrinth before Luke and his army does. The adventure is on about every page with Percy or his friends killing monsters such as giants or dracaena or Percy and his friends trying to run away from the monsters. Like when Percy had to battle another half blood to the death until he backed down and of course a monster starts chasing him attacked down and is epic adventure, Percy will be booted across the world from an explosion, kill a giant twice the size of him, and percy, Annabeth, Grover,Tyson and Rachel  to find a man who has trapped himself in the greatest maze of all time. Or will all of the monsters stop them from finding Daedalus and stopping Kronos' army.     \\"We ran until we were exhausted. Rachel steered us away from traps, but we had no destination in mind--only away from that dark mountain and the roar of Kronos.    We stopped in at tunnel of wet white rock, like part of a natural cave. I couldn't here anything behind us, but I still didn't feel any safer. I could still remember those unnatural golden eyes staring out of Luke's face, and the feeling that my limbs were turning to stone. \\" p. 306.    I chose this section because of the description the author gave me. In the last line when Percy says \\"and the feeling that my limbs were turning to stone.\\" I think that sentence tells a lot about Rick Riordan and his writing style. I think his description of that sentence really gets you to think about what that would feel like or the power of Kronos Lord of Time.            By W Stormey

0439023491|5.0|Could you ever imagine living in a world where every year, kids are sent to their death for other people's entertainment? Katniss Everdeen has made Hunger Games history by managing to keep herself, and her fellow District member alive in the Games. However, she and possibly all of Panem, will pay dearly for it. Suzanne Collins knows that some kids have \\"weak stomachs\\" and makes sure to balance out the action and gore in Catching Fire. For example, whenever Maysilee is attacked by vicious birds, Collins simply says the birds pierced her neck then goes on to talk about something less gory, but just as interesting.  Also, Collins does a great job expressing Katniss's personality and emotions throughout the book. Whenever Katniss is talking about Finnick Odair, a District 4 victor, she not only describes him, but gives her own opinion of him. This makes the book fun to read, because it's not just boring descriptions and an occasional opinion, you get to read the whole thing through Katniss's eyes. Whenever Katniss finds out she will be in the Games again, the emotions are much stronger and real than when the author just says, \\"Katniss then found out she was going to be in the Hunger Games again.\\" It makes you feel like you are right there next to Katniss. Overall, anybody who picks up this book will not want to put it down.
B0043XQ932|3.0|As a long-time Dimmu Borgir follower, and after nearly 8 months of the new album,  I've decided to offer another perspective.  I picked up the album on its day of release and gave it an honest chance.  However, after hearing the train-wreck of a single \\"Gateways\\", I was skeptical.<br /><br />Xibir is an excellent opening to the album.  It sets the tone very well and provides hope that the album could be epic.  Cradle of Filth's opening track to \\"Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder\\" should be the standard for any orchestral introductions, they nailed it.<br /><br />Next, Born Treacherous kicks in, you can immediately tell that the sound quality lacks power and punch.  The orchestra sounds excellent, but the drums are weak and the guitars & bass are drowned out.  I was really disappointed with the lack of clarity.  The drums especially have no power, on a good system you can barely feel them.  The guitars are muddy and get overwhelmed by the orchestra.  This song goes on for too long and lacks the aggressive first-impression that you expect from an album.<br /><br />By now if you don't know about Gateways, don't bother.  The song starts off on fire, great potential, but then changes pace, and changes again, and again.  The female singer detracts from the quality, she's annoying.  The song tries to be too epic, and fails.<br /><br />Chess with the Abyss is surprisingly good.  The lyrics are a little cheesy and repetitive but it's one of the better songs.<br /><br />Dimmu Borgir is an excellent song.  If you can be objective and accept a positive-feeling song, this song is great.  As a side note, this song is phenomenal when performed live.<br /><br />ICS Vortex is gone and nobody can replace him, especially Snowy Shaw.  I could accept the fact that Dimmu Borgir would sound different, so I gave their new clean vocalist a chance, but his dreadful performance on Ritualist ruined any hope.  The music builds up the perfect moment for a great singer to hit a home run, but he butchers it.  Shagrath should have gave it a try instead, couldn't have been any worse.  The music is almost good enough to overlook the terrible singing, but not quite.<br /><br />The rest of the album is a love/hate relationship.  You gotta give the boys credit, it's a solid effort.  Overall, it's a 6.5/10.  There were just too many moments that made you question your true loyalty.  The orchestra is heavily used throughout but the integration is flawless.  It is a very symphonic sounding album but the sound quality is weak doesn't draw you in with its power.  I don't understand how they could have been satisfied with the final production.  If you're new to Dimmu Borgir and don't know which album to hear/buy first, don't pick this one.  See below:<br /><br />Death Cult Armageddon was made in their prime 7/10.<br /><br />In Sorte Diaboli was an instant masterpiece, amazing sound quality and a very consistently great album 9/10.  The Heretic Hammer is one of the best songs they ever made, but it is a bonus song not released on the original version, otherwise it'd be 10/10.<br /><br />Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia marked the beginning of their modern era sound and a phenomenal drumming performance by Nicholas Barker 8/10.<br /><br />Spiritual Black Dimensions is an overall great album but the sound quality is amazingly bad 6/10.<br /><br />Enthrone Darkness Triumphant: before the advent of clean singing, a true black metal classic, 7/10.<br /><br />Stormblast: the beginning, great start but lacks versatility 6/10.instead, couldn't have been any worse.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|The brothers and sisters at YouVersion have done a fantastic job putting this app together! I've been using a combination of the app and the website for almost three years now, and I've loved it the entire time!<br />My favorite features are the downloadable versions that you can store locally on your phone so that when you don't have a network connection, you can still get into the word. Fantastic idea! And it's incredible to see so many new versions being made available offline all the time. Even with the cloud-based versions, it's fantastic because you can switch between versions without losing your place and compare the different translations for better understanding of a passage.<br />Bookmarking, and more importantly syncing with the cloud, are awesome as well! I can set a bookmark on my phone or tablet, and when I log into the website, boom! there it is, and vice versa. It's great for those times where you're moving between different platforms.<br />While the application has not been optimized for Honeycomb (Android 3.0), I know that's coming soon. Despite that slight drawback, which causes the reading plans to not work on my tablet), this is basically the only Bible I use for my daily reading/feeding/studying. I still have hard copy bibles at home that I will read occasionally, but with all the notes, bookmarking, highlighting and other features all in one place this app just makes things so much easier.<br />Oh yes, the reading plans! It is so convenient to be able to search, find, start, stop, pause, and maintain progress in a reading plan in both places (the app and the website). There are times, at the office for instance, where I'm not always able to pull out my tablet/phone and get a connection (network restrictions), and so getting on the website with my office computer allows me to maintain my progress with reading plans and not miss anything.<br />I highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to improve their faithfulness in reading God's Word. Well done, YouVersion! And Praise Jesus for technology that gets us closer to Him!! And Praise Jesus for technology that gets us closer to Him!
B002KS1IJC|2.0|Okay, I watched this movie because of the reviews from other people, but I was totally disappointed. Science fiction meets The Vikings... It doesn't really mash together well. Come on, a space alien dragon named moron or something travels through space or time with this outlander guy to reek havoc on a viking community, but everyone thinks that outlander is the killer. Boring... They try to go after moron (I think that might be his name) but there ends up being two dragons, blah blah, blah,... Guys don't waste your money on this.
B004K8WJ3Y|4.0|I must say that I am a very recent Whitesnake fan. I only had listened Davis Coverdale with Deep Purple and, in my opinion, I think he has one of the top voices of Hard Rock and Heavy Metal. With this new record, he has updated the sound with great musicians and has given Whitesnake fresh air. The sound is very heavy, with great riffs and chorus, and ocassionally acoustic. His voice obviously is not the same but is still powerful and his style improves with time. A great comeback for David and Whitesnake, his in top form. I hope this continue for a long time.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Stevie Nicks' first album of new material in a decade, \\"In Your Dreams\\", is among the best things she's done. It's not like her other albums in any way and that's what makes it so great. It's a whole different sound for Stevie. Some artists go off and do \\"theme\\" albums in their career, be it a dance or covers album or in the 70's for instance everyone did a disco album at some point. And that's what this is for me, a total change of pace. It can't be compared to her previous albums because it's nothing like those albums. \\"In Your Dreams\\" is a breath of brand new air from Stevie. I've always felt that \\"Bella Donna\\" was Stevie's masterpiece, and it remains so, but \\"In Your Dreams\\" is also a masterpiece but painted in a very different style with very different colors. The stand out tracks are:  \\"In Your Dreams\\" ~ I have a feeling Stevie really likes this song and I bet this ends up in the set this summer. It's just one of  those fast up tempo songs that she likes doing on stage.     \\"New Orleans\\" ~ Starts off slow, but then the chorus kicks in and it blooms.     \\"Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream)\\" ~ This is where the album kicks in for me. The beginning is taken from an old demo fans have had for years called \\"Lady From The Mountain\\" and she sings it almost exactly like the demo in the whisper like voice. She's turned a lot of older beloved demos into full-fledged songs lately and some of them didn't work, \\"Smile At You\\", \\"Goodbye Baby\\", but this one does. The new lyrics added to the original track  really complete and fit the song.     \\"Annabel Lee\\" ~ This was demo'd for 2001's \\"Trouble In Shangri-La\\" but didn't make the cut.  Music by Stevie, lyrics based on the poem By Edgar Allan Poe.  Stevie and Poe seem to be a match made in heaven.     \\"Soldier's Angel\\" ~ First thought was this was another \\"Desert Angel\\" (a track from her 1991 best of album, \\"TimeSpace\\") but this is much better. Lindsey Buckingham adds a sparse, cold guitar and vocals that just nail this song. Thisisn't supposed to be a happy song, it's dark, depressing, cold, and empty. It's a perfect example of music and subject matter being perfectly matched. Not a song that everyone will like, but the song is almost like a slap in the face. Stevie makes her point beautifully.     \\"Ghosts Are Gone\\" ~ This would be a perfect song to open her show with. This is one of those songs that you cannot sit still and just listen to.     \\"\\"Italian Summer\\" ~ The big lush strings at the start are a switch for Stevie. Another nice touch are the Beach Boy-esque background \\"aahh ahhh's\\" Again the music fits the lyric and you feel like you're out there with her looking out over the ocean at the islands. And that final note? Who knew Stevie had that in her!!??    \\"Cheaper Than Free\\" ~ A simple country song with simple yet thought provoking lyrics.     Stevie is back and better than ever on \\"In Your Dreams\\". Longtime fans will love this album, casual fans may need some time to digest it. It's a different sound for Stevie, but still unmistakably Stevie.
B004HD2ZIQ|4.0|Listening this new Motorhead record, I can only thank for keeping on the road and studio groups like this. Motorhead gets better with time. This record has a lot of energy, great songs, the world is yours is more melodic tham Motorizer adn I like it more the more i listen to it. Born to lose is the opening track and an instant classic. Every song is great but my favourites are: Rock and roll music (not the Ch Berry song), Bye Bye Bitch Bye Bye, Outlaw. Brotherhood of man is darker in the style of Orgasmatron. If you're fan of Motorhead, go ahead and buy it, you won't be disappointed. If you are new to Motorhead, and you like classic heavy metal, I think this is a good point to start getting into Motor-world. I can't wait for their next album.

I haven't read any of the other stereotypical \\"food-related\\" books (Pollan, etc.), but this one raised some interesting moral questions I simply hadn't considered before.  JSF not so much advocates vegetarianism because it is wrong to eat meat, but presents his personal journey and ultimate decision based on his desire to not support an entire industry he finds fundamentally repugnant.  A necessary read for anyone who has ever eaten meat, in my opinion.  : )

So high school of the dead starts off with alot of action. I.E. a zombie head getting smashed into a wall. Soon you will notice the untold amounts of fan-service scattered throughout I.E. watch the opening on youtube.    In short.  if you like anime  if you like zombies  if you like ecchi / fan-service  if you like action    then this is your kind of anime. which I then highly recommend

B001A5W8YA|5.0|This is the first Bond novel I have read, and I defintely think that the enviroment in which it takes place with the plot makes this a must read Bond. With less complete action but still a great Bond story, I suppose you might not like this if you want constant shoot out and fights, but this book still has a healthy supply. Going into new details that usally aren't adressed in others like ethics and even a tad of business with the mastermind Dr. No, this is defintely a must read for all Bond fans.

0307454541|2.0|I've been hearing nothing but good reviews for \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and decided to try it. It seemed like a good book. However, I was disappointed once I did start reading it. I found it dull and uneventful. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't read much of it. I think I stopped after a couple of chapters. I did try to continue and I skimmed towards the end to see if it would be worth reading. It wasn't. It was just stiff and dull for me to continue on. I didn't like it at all. I think part of it might have been because it was translated into English and at times translated things aren't as good as the native tongue. And partly because there was a lot of \\"then, and then, and then\\" in there which I absolutely hate. I couldn't stand to read that.<br /><br />Though I know this is a popular book and I'm sure there will be tons of people still recommending it to others and maybe some that will hate my comments, I can't recommend it. If I don't feel it was exciting or interesting, I'm not going to tell my friends to read something I couldn't even read through. For me, it wasn't good.

B003J27WFW|5.0|This is a must for die-hard Rush fans as well as those who are just familiar with the band.  The entire history of the band members is covered from grade school through today.   You find that friendships and mutual respect are what drives the bands' heart and soul.  You learn quite a bit about the \\"New Guy\\", even though he is rather camera shy.  The talent that these long-time performers exude does not go to their heads and you soon realize that they have quirks and silliness that is very humanizing.    Commentary from other rock legends reinforces Rush's place among some of the greatest acts ever known.  Fans attempt to explain their undying fervor and personal interviews with the band members show that there is still a trace of humility amidst the glowing aura of super stardom.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|As I am writing this, Amazon is \\"reviewing\\" this product and no longer offering it due to complaints about the blu ray sets of Strar Trek the original series - Seasons 1-3. I have this set and can tell you there is nothing wrong with it. There was no problem with the packaging, the picture or the audio on this set. The problem seems to be with peoples inability to know how to use the features of their blu ray players or thier audio equipment. There ARE options for the sound. If you don't have the right equipment you can always change the sound output to the original mono instead of the 7.1 DTS HD audio option. I have my blu ray hooked up to a two speaker system and when I have the audio of the blu ray player set to 7.1 DTS HD (this feature can be changed no matter if you are watching the original or enhanced version) I do notice that the sound seems lower. This is because my stereo is not set up for 7.1 DTS HD sound. I simply set the audio of my blu ray to the 2.0 mono and I can hear everything fine. It's not rocket science, people. As for all the other complaints...I think people are just being way too petty. I think the blu ray technology is a little too advanced for some of you. Hooking your blu ray player up to a non HD tv isn't going to improve the picture much. The same goes with the audio.       I waited a long time to own every Star Trek episode. I'm glad I didn't go with VHS or DVD because these Blu-ray discs are superior in every way. I hope Amazon will continue to offer this set to the rest of you. If they do, don't hesitate to buy it. Like I said, there's nothing wrong with these sets.

I have tried SO many diets and this is the only one that has actually been working for me. The really cool thing about the Dukan diet is that it is really simple to follow, it basically just tells you what you can and cannot eat, without limiting quantities. It's definitely working for me!
B004SEVPWQ|4.0|The is a fun game; it has garnered more of my gaming time than any other game I have installed, and this one is the latest.

B0039O8AQK|5.0|The film is gray and drab, setting an atmosphere of hopelessness and despair...for those awake to the true reality. Others among the Sheeple wouldn't know any different. The film does a good job of sticking to Orwell's novel, but I came away wanting more. More of the inner workings of the Party and more of Winston's daily life of meager existence. If you've read the book, you'll be able to fill in the pieces. You are required to use your imagination a bit and this is where having read the book will help immensely. I once read that one page in a script translates into one minute on screen. To do Orwell's nightmare justice another thirty minutes would have been welcomed. All in all, this is a great movie. Ever try to find it for sale? Wonder why it's so hard to get...    What's scary is the parallels to today's times. In the book Orwell states that the war is never meant to be won, but all that matters is that it be indefinite. War on Terror anyone? Goldstein was the Party's favorite whipping boy. Osama Bin Laden perhaps? Quite a useful tool these past ten years, but even the political string pullers knew his usefulness had come to an end - He either died in Tora Bora or shortly thereafter of renal failure. The ever present telescreens with Big Brothers face? Cameras everywhere we turn these days recording our every move, and not to mention the proles all to eager to give every bit of their personal information away on Facebook. And yet they randomly complain about privacy settings. Ever watch Wag The Dog? How easy is it to pull off a hoax and get the brain dead public to believe a lie?     What didn't exist before 9/11? The DHS and the Patriot Act. But you didn't really need those Constitutional rights and freedoms anyway. Did you? The ever present and never ending War on Terror was born. Ever since there's been a high profile botched terror attempt here and there...that we somehow magically stop in the nick of time! Let's all cheer and agree we need to lose more ofour freedoms in support of this war. The book parallel? That female voice once again telling us about some small victory won in the latest battle. Here's an excerpt from the book that fits. Think of this every time there is a staged attack or attempt:    \\"Once when he happened in some connection to mention the war against Eurasia, She startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, `just to keep people frightened.'\\" Anything to keep the public school graduates believing the lie.    Recently the crowds gathered outside the White House to cheer Osama's killing. Reminded me of the Two Minutes Hate for Goldstein and his associates. And what about Big Sis Napolitano's plan to use Facebook and text messages to keep us informed about how scared we should be as well as how glad we are that our freedoms are rapidly vanishing? Just like the omnipresent female voice blaring out of the telescreen. Just visit a Wal Mart and you'll see the telescreen.     No need to think for yourself in these times. The public school system has taken care of that. Just vote for one of the two major parties. They're both bought and paid for and voting for one is really a vote for the other. At the end of the day, they're the same. It's all a card game with a stacked deck not in our favor.     False Flag attacks have been a tool used for a long time. Hitler burning the Reichstag; Johnson sinking the USS Liberty, Operation AJAX, Gulf of Tonkin, and Operation Gladio to name a few.     Read the book, watch the movie and think about these times we're living in. Ask yourself who profits and what is the reaction by the government after these staged attempts.     Wake up people. The TSA will soon be at the mall and train and bus stations. It won't be long before we have to go through a scanner at every major sporting event. I guess the reasoning is violating non-Middle Eastern descent American citizens' Constitutional rights prevents Islamic terror?    Orwell's vision is a warning where we are headed...it's just too bad that message is lost on those more interested in American Idol and Dancing with the Stars.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|I bought these just before Christmas of 2010. I used them 3-4 times a week for about a month and a half, and then didn't use them at all for a week. After that, they didn't work for about 10 months. Was just recently able to get them working again. Customer service at Turtle Beach tried to be helpful, but used too much technical jargon, making it impossible for me to follow instructions.    On the head phones themselves, the sound from them is quite good actually. They aren't very comfortable though, which detracts from their overall appeal. They tend to press on certain parts of the ear, making them hurt after an hour or two. I like the wireless capability (minus the issues mentioned above). They're pretty expensive, and given that I wasn't able to use them for several months, they're not really cost effective. I'd look elsewhere. Maybe a model where your ear actually fits inside the headphone, comfortably.
B00006G8LB|4.0|I've always appreciated Spider Man (Spidey) because he's like a real person with real problems.  I loved Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in their roles as Peter Parker and the girl next door.  This was an epic movie that covered a lot of ground in Spiderman's early life, explaining how he got to be what he became.      What I like most of this movie is the depiction of Spidey's city, New York with touches of Chicago and made in a fantasyland of good people and some hardcore villains.   My least favorite dimension was surprisingly a good part of the action and special effects.  I expected to like the spiderlike scenes more, but they seemed repetitious and overly long to me.  I recommend the movie but without the one hundred percent endorsement I expected.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I really liked this show since the first episode. It has an amazing plot, but also gory scenes. I recommend this DVD to all the zombie fans out there, you won't regret.<br />But I think that the price is really high for a 6-episode season, when a 22-episode regular season DVD it's between 30 and 40 dollars.<br />Otherwise, I love this show! Looking forward to season two.
1561005533|5.0|Wilbur Smith grabbed me right away and held me fast through to the bitter end of this incredibly long story.  Thankfully, the reader, Dick Hill, was excellent if not ideal.  I learned a lot about ancient history, particularly of the Egyptians before, during and immediately after the Hyksos occupation.      There were many long tangents in this epic, including hunting hippopotamuses, fighting elephants, issues of wildebeests and horses, technology of the day, mythology of the era and more.  The plot held me tightly so that I was able to listen and learn so much.  By the end of the book I was praying for a conclusion.  While I recommend it highly, I cannot listen a second time.

0425241505|5.0|I am so glad I read the first installment of Thea Harrison's new Elder Races series.  The world she builds is believable and interesting, with magical creatures more-or-less openly living in political states that overlay the political boundaries of the US that we mere mortals inhabit.<br /><br />Each area is controlled by one Elder Race.  In New York City, the Wyr are lead by a dragon-shapeshifter s powerful, so demanding, so ancient, so enticing, that he puts other romantic heroes to shame.  There is also a much lesser-known half-Wyr named Pia who cannot shapeshift, but who is smart, knows her own mind, and isn't easily lead astray by male machinations (well not usually).  When these two characters meet, sparks fly in more ways than one.<br /><br />The plot is mesmerizing, the romance breathtaking, and the outcome thrilling.  I'm not going to say more because I don't want to take one moment of pleasure from readers.  Harrison is one of the wittiest paranormal romance writers to come along in a very long time.  If you enjoy the work of writers like JD Ward and Nalini Singh, you will love this stunning debut.  Highly recommended!!

B003E6K1VK|5.0|I for one was sick and tired of my AKG 271's sounding underpowered while i was on the go, at home i have a schiit asgard headphone amp and it really makes my akg's sing but i wanted that sound at work and just could not get it with them connected to my Ipad.  So I went over to head fi and did some research on a cheaper more simple dac/amp combo that would be able to handle my AKG's with ease.  Enter the E7(which i bought on amazon through the Micca store) it came in a well put together package which included the following: silicone cover, line in cord, screen protector and USB cable.  I also purchased the ipad camera kit for use with the USB cable and L3 cord to connect my ipod nano to the E7.  All I can say is i am highly impressed, it really opened my AKG's up, it sounded like there was better separation for individual instruments and the mids, highs and vocals were more crisp and detailed.  If you need something to power your power hungry headphones and are on a budget take a look at the E7 you wont be disappointed.
1932100385|5.0|This book will change your life!  I LOVED this book...it takes our food and explains in Great Detail what's in it how and why it works to Help you or how it can Really HURT you!      I have NEVER felt better Mentally and physically! You always hear eat your fruits and vegetables But...when you really Understand WHY....You can only blame yourself if you feed your body garbage.       Knowledge is Power! RED THIS BOOK! In summary Don't Mess with Mother Nature! God created our bodies and our surroundings ....When we they take our food process it and take out the nutrition we get sick!
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Right, so I just got this today after coming back home... Needless to say, I was excited, but when I opened the package and put the batteries in, my face fell. It was sonic all right, sounds and everything! But, for some reason, the light wasn't able to light up. I have sent a request to return it for a replacement, but hopefully this defect was only just in mine. Overall, the toy construction is good, the detail is nice, and I really like the sound of it. The pen was full of ink ready to use! It's a good toy, but it's unfortunate that my bulb was already burned out.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Much better the the calandar app that was bundled with DX, especially in handling multiple calandars     Plus  - able to see appt by description vs just a color bar  - different color bar or desc color depending on which calandar it's on     Bug issues that exist in DX built in apps are working properly here:  - Event privacy set to default allows people you share calandar with to see the detail vs going into extra setting and selecting public manually in builtin cal.  - Allows you to search event vs the builtin app needs to use searchify  - Repeat appointment works for for my google app account vs the standard app drops the last day of the repeat appt.
0316069485|5.0|This is really a great effort by Connelly, to create a thrilling,interesting and exciting read.    Yes, it is mostly a courtroom drama.  But really good drama, with fascinating twists and turns.    Beautifully written by the master.  I liked having Harry Bosch back on the scene.     The windup courtroom scenes were an exciting can't-put -it - down whirlwind and I found the ending      particularly interesting and won't give it away here.  A highly recommended read. Can't wait for the next book!
B004Q1FDHO|3.0|Good fun game, but freezes often on DX.  Thought it was because I was running from SD card, but the same problem exist running from phone memory. Had to pull the battery most of the time when it freezes.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|The village of Wall takes its name from the fieldstone wall not far outside it, on the other side of which (though not visible to the casual overlooker) is a world where magic works, stars are living beings, and enchanted princesses, swordplay, and airships are an everyday part of life.  As a young man Dunstan Thorn (Nathaniel Parker) eluded the wall's ancient guard (David Kelly), crossed over, and met a girl--whose son was left at the wall nine months later in a basket.  Now the boy, Tristan (Charlie Cox), is 18 and knows nothing of his mother or her world.  But when he promises the pretty but shallow Victoria (Sienna Miller) that he'll bring her the falling star that appears to have landed on the far side of the wall, Dunstan tells him the truth and gives him the \\"Babylon candle\\"--a magical artifact that can take you anywhere you desire to go instantaneously--that his mother provided in case he one day wanted to seek her out.  Much to his astonishment, the star, when he finds it, turns out to be a beautiful girl named Yvaine (Claire Danes), who only wants to return to her home in the sky--and definitely *doesn't* want to be dragged over the wall to impress Victoria.  What neither Yvaine nor Tristan knows is that three witchly sisters, notably Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer), are eager to capture Yvaine, whose death can restore their fading youth--or that the two survivors (Mark Strong, Jason Flemying) of the original eight sons of the recently deceased king (Peter O'Toole) are seeking the necklace she has innocently acquired.  Or that if Yvaine crosses the wall she will become a mere lump of stone, since that's what shooting stars are in our world.  As they trek across the countryside the two slowly become attracted to each other, though neither is quite sure what's happening until they fall in with Capt. Shakespeare (Robert deNiro) and his crew of air pirates, who harvest lightning for magical purposes aboard a splendidly realized zeppelin-of-sorts.  The Captain, whosereputation is fearsome but who is really a softy at heart, teaches Yvaine to dance, Tristan to swordfight, and both to dress as befits them.  Then Lamia and Prince Septimus both catch up, Tristan's mother re-enters the picture, and perils and revelations fly thick and fast.  Even if you've never read Neil Gaiman's original (I hadn't), you can enjoy this wonderfully original fairy tale and its splendid special effects.  Ian McKellan, better known as Gandalf the Gray and Magneto, provides a resonant narrative voice.
B00127RAJY|1.0|Is too basic and much cardio, that makes my knees hurts a lot.   I really thought it was good cause it has so many good comments, but usually I work out, so this is too basic, not really challenge moves, just a lot of jumping.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|On Christmas morning, sometime around 1903-4, in a handsome Victorian house in a quiet neighborhood, a young husband presents his wife with a gift: a cocker spaniel puppy who is immediately christened Lady.  Lady grows up the pampered and beloved pet of her \\"Jim Dear\\" and \\"Darling\\" and the ward of her two nearest canine neighbors, a canny purebred Scottish terrier known as Jock and a courtly Southern bloodhound named Trusty who many years ago, before he lost his sense of smell, used to track criminals through the swamps with \\"my gran'pappy, Ol' Reliable.\\"  Then Lady's humans learn that they are about to become parents, and everything turns upside down: they're distracted, they don't spend as much time with Lady or pay as much attention as they used to.  But the worst is yet to come: when their son is still only an infant they go off for a few days alone, leaving the house, the baby, and Lady in the care of Jim Dear's Aunt Sarah--who means well enough but doesn't realize what connivers her two Siamese cats are.  Before she knows it, poor Lady is out on the streets, where she teams up with the terrier-mongrel Tramp, a previous acquaintance, and \\"puppy\\" love blooms.  Tramp urges her to come away with him--\\"But who'd watch over the baby?\\" she asks.  Then the dogcatcher descends, Lady is thrown into the pound, and it looks as if all hope is gone.  But Tramp still has a heroic part to play when a sinister rat gains entry to the house...    This has always been one of my favorite Disney animations; though the dogs speak (and who's to say that dogs don't, among themselves?), they still behave like real dogs; each is a clearly drawn individual, and the art is beautiful.  Cat lovers may take issue with the sly villainy of Aunt Sarah's \\"precious pets\\" (Disney gives the felines their day in the sun in [[ASIN:B000XUOIQ4 The Aristocats (Special Edition)]], which might make a good double feature), but for dog lovers it's just about perfect.  And even after all these decades, I still chill when Trusty picks up the scent of the dogcatcher's wagon and begins to bay!

B003UESJHO|1.0|Any time Mark Wahlberg really wants something to happen, we should feel safe in assuming it must be stopped. After all, as the title of this review alluded to, he was the one who really wanted to have his own \\"Funky Bunch\\".     And so it is with \\"The Fighter\\". This time around, Mark's \\"Funky Bunch\\" is comprised of Amy Adams (who was actually quite good and didn't allow this clunker to spoil her tremendous reputation, even if it did waste her time), Christian Bale (whose greatest acting talent appears to be his ability to lose weight on command), and Melissa Leo (who I am supposed to pretend I've heard of before. I checked her filmography on Wikipedia; I've seen many movies starring her. For that matter, I saw her in \\"The Fighter\\" just a minute ago. Yet still I couldn't pick her out of a lineup if my life depended on it. Her performances are just that unremarkable.)    These four converge to make ANOTHER boxing movie. Yep, 172 bajillion boxing movies just wasn't quite enough, apparently. Never mind that boxing is a completely dead sport now (possibly due in part to all the boxing movies), and certainly never mind that Scorsese already made a boxing movie that will NEVER ever be topped, ever.     And where do you put your movie about possibly the most overworked subject in all of cinema? Boston, silly. The most overworked setting in all of cinema. Never mind that this movie has nothing to do with the central theme of \\"Boston movies\\" (the juxtaposition of encroaching modern leftist society and \\"traditional\\" American society). After all, you can always just juxtapose any two random elements in the film (Amy Adams' character and Christian Bale's character). All you really need is a juxtaposition and it counts as a Boston movie, apparently.    The plot is... and this is almost hard to believe... even MORE overworked than the subject and setting. There's a love interest, a drug problem, and an underdog story. That's it. That's the whole movie. They were a government conspiracy away from The Grand Slam of Cliched Crap.    I kept watching \\"The Fighter\\" because I would've been willing to sit through all its nonsense if the Ward vs. Gatti trilogy was pulled off well. It's obviously the only defensible reason for making a movie about Ward in the first place, and I honestly think it would've made a good movie all by itself. You call it \\"Irish\\", keep Micky as the protagonist, and let the dying gasps of boxing serve as your representation of \\"traditional\\" American society, thus making it a Boston movie. Wahlberg plays Ward, Gael Garcia Bernal could play Gatti, maybe a sportswriter played by Felicity Huffman to round it out. Just spitballing.     My spitballing, however, is more coverage of the Ward vs. Gatti trilogy than the entire 115 minutes of \\"The Fighter\\" was able to cover. Apparently there just wasn't room in a Micky Ward biopic to cover the only remarkable thing Micky Ward was ever a part of.     This film had a deep commitment to underwhelming, and it stands as one of the most generic Oscar pictures I've ever had the misfortune of watching. It also means that it's been over four years since Wahlberg's last good movie (\\"The Departed\\"). Unlike his character on \\"Entourage\\", the real Wahlberg's career won't be determined by the whims of a (mediocore) scriptwriter. To maintain a good reputation it's helpful to occasionally take part in a movie that doesn't suck. Whenever his name was brought up a few years ago it would conjure images of \\"Boogie Nights\\". Now I'm starting to think of him more as the guy from the remake of \\"The Planet of the Apes\\".

B003EYVXTG|2.0|What's cooler than neo-folk? Nothing, right? Radiohead just made a neo-folk album for chrissakes. It is everything that is now, at least in pop music. This makes it all the more natural for the critical darling \\"Winter's Bone\\" to catch me just at the right moment, to become that annual indie movie I just can't shut up about, right?    Here's the problem: Neo-folk, as best I understand it, is perhaps most significant for being a genre of music that has never, nor will ever, attempt to exist. When Fleet Foxes or The Decemberists put down \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\" just long enough to pick up a banjo and a jug and sing a song about their heartfelt Christian beliefs or how hard it is to chop down a tree, we are to immediately assume they are speaking metaphorically.    Not so with \\"Winter's Bone\\". It seems to get stuck halfway between literal and metaphorical and thus not only does it basically end up with neither, it also completely alienates itself from the genre which made it relevant in the first place. There's log cabins, the chopping of firewood, and bizarre masculine legal codes that only exist in westerns, but there's also trailers, crystal meth, and U.S. Army recruitment. Ya can't tell whether it wants to be \\"There Will Be Blood\\" or \\"Precious\\".     And I guess it wants to be a bit of both. But the problem with that, and the reason this movie just isn't any good, is that when you bring the neo-folk concept out of a purely literary environment and cast the light of modern reality on it, it just doesn't mean anything anymore. The abstraction of purity juxtaposed with the supposedly \\"impure\\" contemporary doesn't make a statement as much as it makes a sigh. This movie does A LOT of sighing.    This is the natural jumping-off point for me to touch on the rampant feminism of the film, so let's do so. Yes, all the sighing is probably a girl thing, and I probably just don't understand how significant sighing really is because I'm a dude. Let's just assume that's true. Even still, I refuse now and always will refuse to accept that I need any sort of double standard within my film criticism, irrespective of the gender or creed of the filmmaker. I'm not just gonna let this slide because it's a \\"powerful\\" feminist narrative and the world needs more of those (which is the position I assume most critics took when grading the film).     What can I say, I'm an egalitarian. And this movie sucks.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|The books? Amazing. I would highly recommend them. The kindle price? The most RIDICULOUS thing I've ever seen.

In my new system, which has substantial cooling, the processor ran at 62c !  And that was at Idle!  And yes, it was installed correctly.  A little research on the net shows this as a typical number.    Don't even bother installing the stock cooler!    I recommend the Corsair A50 or A70 if you have enough case space.  I installed the A70 (with only one of it's two fans due to memory clearance issues) and it dropped the temps by over 25c.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|This will not include the original theatrical versions so I can't see the point of buying a set just to get the botched 2004 transfers upscaled to HD. Darkened picture, blue tint, pink lightsabers and all film grain smoothed out. The movies now look like they were shot on HD video a few years ago as they are very unfaithful to the original look and contrast of pretty much any previous version, including the 1997 Special Editions. In my opinion, they are one of the worst home video transfer of any movie. On the other hand Episode 1 will feature a brand new transfer. Yeah, great the movie that visually already looks the best (only prequel that was shot on 35mm film) is getting the most attention.<br />The only reason I'm not giving this one star is because 3 of the discs will be for extras including deleted scenes from the OT that have never been released before.

LFL has already admitted this won't be the long desired definitive set as there is too much being discovered everyday in their archives for them to have everything completely prepared. If this set does not sell as well as hoped, it will probably be a lot easier for LFL executives to convince George Lucas to restore the theatrical versions and finally give us what we want the most.<br />If you don't have the original versions on dvd, you'd be better off buying this set FOR A LOT LESSS!!!<br />[[ASIN:B001EN71DG Star Wars Trilogy]]<br />It has the 2004 versions and non anamorphic unaltered dvd's of each movie in one slim set.

0439023491|5.0|Although this series is intended for a young audience, I found them to have surprising depth.  I purchased the first, and then waited impatiently for the others to arrive!  I couldn't put them down.
B003L20ICE|4.0|This movie was excellent. Very real but not a movie for children. Deserving of all the awards it was nominated for.
B004EPYZQM|4.0|I remember seeing the first one and being wowed by it. I was just a kid, so of course it was something for me. I was 10 and saw it with a few friends and loved it. However I can't recall being impressed with a single sequel since then. Especially the puke fest that was \\"Tokyo Drift\\". 2 Fast was boring as hell and FAF seemed very slow and unfocused.<br /><br />So I didn't expect much from this movie... and all I can say is WOW.<br /><br />This movie was actually not bad for once. I can't believe for the first time I am able to say I enjoyed a TFATF sequel.<br /><br />The plot isn't anything original or groundbreaking- but the movie is well aware of it, and just piled on the action. That said, even the unoriginality was entertaining- the setting of Rio, a mob boss' money, the robbery of the money, etc.<br /><br />The action is intense and involving- I hated the shaky camera and quick cutting in movies 2-4, so this was much needed. Furthermore, the finale, where two cars transport a bank vault (not ridiculous enough for you?) was incredibly fun, as was the shootout and roof-jumping scene.<br /><br />The humour was evident- the script was like Aaron Sorkin wrote an action movie. I loved the scene where the bomb goes off in the toilet pipes, causing a rain of poop in all the stalls, as was the police car racing scene, etc. Great balance of humour and action.<br /><br />The cast was great too- Vin was his usual cool self, but gotta say, Tyrese Gibson stole the show!!! I loved how he said \\"Say What?\\" at every impossible situation. The Rock was fantastic as well- I was looking forward to seeing him in it, and he did a fantastic job.<br /><br />My one complaint was that the movie was a smidge too long- maybe 10 minutes should have been trimmed, but ah, what the hell I had fun.<br /><br />You know what... give the crew a cookie, they did a good job with this movie, they made it fun and entertaining, and therefore even if you hate the franchise, the movie stands out on its own well.

0515142247|1.0|I really like the Jack Reacher series of stories. They are not literature, just enjoy them for what they are, a one night fly through read of pure entertainment. I have read the first eleven books in this series so far. I like them all.... all except this one. So what is wrong with this book compared to other Reacher novels?    What really makes the Reacher novels work is his detective and investigative work. He is ex-military badass, he knows weapons, but this is all just icing on the cake. It is his methodological reasoning and perception in staying ahead of various enemies that stands out. Despite the clichés, Lee Child writes with some great intelligence in setting these situations up.    But 'Die Trying' has few of these elements. It is essentially a Rambo movie, with Reacher running around in the jungle with a knife taking guys out. It is boring compared to any other Reacher novel.     But what I really do not like about this book is the politics. You have to bring yourself back to the 90's era this was written in. Before we had our Milosevic's, our Saddam's and our Bin Laden's, the western political elite were desperately searching for an enemy to replace the Soviet Union. For a while there, it seemed like peace and co-operation between nations was about to break out.  In place of not having any credible choices of an enemy to externalize, the US Government turned to demonization of internal enemies, such as patriot and paramilitary groups. Usually shown as a bunch of bearded crazies ranting about the constitution and wanting to secede from the Union. So author Lee Child attempts to cash in here on this mid 90's trend.    But the problem is the issues Lee Child tries to ridicule, such as the federal reserve, constitutional violations, ever omnipotent Government....these are real and serious issues, and books like 'Die Trying' seek to tar those who are concerned with such matters, by association with armed crazies in fatigues. In fact, the people really concerned about such matters are mostly non-violent types respectful of other folk's liberty and property. Many such people are naturally and unknowingly following the 'non-aggression principle' (google the term)    So.....     The way Lee Child and the real US administration of the time hyped this Patriot threat was to be the biggest joke of all; as if a bunch of fat guys with guns under their beds are going to form some sort of Redneck A-team and overthrow the Government. It was a pure fantasy threat to the power of Government, just a convenient excuse to expand the reach of the State and violate ever more of our freedoms and liberties.    You may see this review as going off on a tangent, but do not get me wrong.......even if I had no problem with the politics, this book is still bad (1 star) because of the first mentioned reasons; no investigative work, running through the jungle like Rambo, and comical villains (comical even by the standards of Jack Reacher novels).

B004E2XAFW|4.0|This is Within Temptations Newest and Latest album and it doesn't let the fans of this band down. from Shot in the Dark (why not me is just mother maiden excerpt from the mother maiden short film) to A stairway to the skies this features songs that proves that Within Temptations ever changing sound produces masterpieces one after the next. The DVD has all of the Short films and Music Videos they posted on the internet (Mother Maiden/ Faster, Sinead/ Sinead, Triplets/ A Shot in the Dark) along with the first DVD release of the video for Utopia and the making of for the videos. Also on the DVD is the list of Facebook names and the prequel to the unforgiving comic book (goes too fast and unless you have a large TV you won't be able to read it).  The poster that comes with it is 2 sided one is just the album art and the other side is the Facebook names listed off with a water mark of Within Temptation the eagle logo that follows this album. other little neat things with this version of the album is the lyrics book it has more The Unforgiving art inside it with the lyrics in comic book bubble fashion and it also folds out to show what is also the design for within temptations race car. Now all this is great but the killing nail that makes it go from a 5 star to a 4 star. it's a Digipak, yes that cardboard crap it's in its a tri foldout with a \\"protective\\" outer sleeve that you have to take it out of each time you want to listen to the album slowly rubbing off the ink of the main album art while leaving the outer sleeves art open to whatever nature or wear and tear can throw at it.

0756404738|2.0|The Wise Man's Fears suffers from a problem that has been getting out of control in the publishing business: lack of editing.  It seems that the effects of the huge layoffs over the last few years are becoming more and more obvious.  The average number of pages in books, especially in the science fiction/fantasy genre, has grown enormously without an equal increase in quality.  This book could have been as great as The Name of the Wind if someone had spent time cutting out about a third of it and making sure that the story was actually compelling.  Authors often won't admit that not all of his/her writing is deathless prose, and that attitude is perfectly understandable.  I too would find it difficult to throw away pages that I had spent hundreds of hours composing. That's what editors are for.  I don't expect every editor to be Maxwell Perkins, but some sort of discipline has to be imposed.  I got about half way through The Wise Man's Fears before I realized that I just didn't care what happened to Kvothe, and that makes me extremely sad.
B001AXU1CS|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE !!! MY FAVORITE MOVIE!! HAD IT ON VHS &lt;SO I HAD TO GET IT ON DVD !!! BETTER quality!!!
B00003RQNJ|1.0|I recieved my much anticipated dvd... only to find I could not play it in my dvd player. I think when selling these items the seller should give the buyer a heads up on this little fact. The dvd was a region code 12 - it was sold to an address in the U.S.A. Why wouldn't the region code match the country?? On top of that- the shipping cost is not reimbursed since it is a region code error. What a scam! Not everyone has the ability to change or get a region free fix. I am VERY dissappointed with MovieMars and won't be buying with them again.
B004SEVPWQ|4.0|I've had a love/hate relationship with the lite version of this game for a long time now - I like pool and am always on the lookout for great pool games, but those are few and far between.  The love part of this game are that the graphics are great and the physics seem solid, and gameplay is quick.  The hate comes from the fact that the AI goes from being absurdly bad on the easiest level to supernaturally unstoppable on any other level; not to mention the fact that you simply can't make a shot if you don't have the guidelines set to full.  I do like that I now have the ability to play people online, though sometimes the lag is so bad that there's no point in even trying.  Overall, though, this is the best pool option for Android.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Over the years, I've bought these movies on VHS, I've bought them on laserdisk, and I've bought them on DVD. Every version gets farther and farther from what I saw on the big screen back in 1977, 1980, and 1983 and I see no evidence that these new versions will be any different.    I'm done.     Once the original versions of episodes IV, V, and VI are available I will gladly buy them on Blu-ray, but until then I'm content to stop buying close-but-not-quite versions of these classics. I'm tired rewarding bad behavior.

0618001905|2.0|Too bad publishers - even serious and otherwise reliable ones - don't treat Kindle customers with the same respect as they do buyers of printed books. This Kindle version, as pointed out by another reviewer, is full of mistakes, formatting issues, and lacks many of the features of the print edition.<br /><br />I also hope Amazon will make sure that Kindle books - especially full-price ones - are free of mistakes in the future. Unfortunately, these are still way too common.<br /><br />I'll be glad to remove this unfavorable review as soon as the problem is corrected, as Adam Hochschild's book is excellent, and deserves the best possible edition in any format.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game brought back memories of playing Myst way back in the day. It's very similar adventure game, and keeps you frustrated/ interested to figure out and solve the puzzles in the game.    It is only \\"very short\\" if you know what to do without exploring. Decently long, but not quite as long as a similar full PC game.    Some things that I felt were not well designed (but may have fit in with the vision of \\"just click everything!\\" -     *There is a corridor on the second floor between the other doors- you have to click in the middle of the wall, and find there is another door.     *They used four birds, and four colors on the globe, but needing to be arranged in a direction, corresponding to the drawing on the second floor. Confusing since the colors on the globe seem to have the same directions of the drawing, and not the \\"statues\\"    * in the main hallway both the floor and the \\"paper\\" on the painting aren't visibly \\"interactive\\".    Overall a fun game, and most of the puzzles are fun to figure out. Graphics are great, the only real complaints are the issues with the game design, and possibly wanting more to the story - but it is after all a puzzle game, and not needing a \\"cool story\\".

B004Q1FDHO|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from a \\"redneck fishing game\\", but I was pleasantly surprised.     Well polished, good looking graphics, and much more depth than I had thought.     The main point of the game is to drop weapons onto fish, and collect them.    Sub-quests include being able to pay for more expensive \\"boats\\" that act as upgrades, pay a \\"girlfriend\\" money to progress the game/ unlock other locations and other \\"daily goals\\".     The graphics look professinally done, sound effects are good enough, and there are options to do different things while playing.    I did have some issues with it having problems \\"crashing\\" on the phone. It would play well most of the time- but then have hard freezes that would lock the whole phone for a few minutes, then resume. After rebooting the phone, it seemed to run without consistent freeze-ups, but they eventually returned (Galaxy S).    Decent time wasting game- with a surprise amount of extra depth, but a bit of memory management issues.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|With \\"In your dreams,\\" Ms. Stevie Nicks is back in peak form. Her voice sounds refreshingly vital and urgent. Every single song is amazing, and the theme of love is intertwined magically throughout. The new top 20 adult contemporary single, \\"Secret Love\\" opens the set with a very sweet and radio friendly hook. Then \\"For what it's worth\\" launches into a folk guitar driven ditty that is so Stevie. \\"Moonlight\\" reworks her demo, \\"Lady from the mountain,\\" a fan fave, with a new chorus that sounds like two songs in one, yet it fits so snugly and perfectly. Dave Stewart is the perfect choice to produce this artfully stunning music. Dave \\"gets\\" Stevie, and he presents this music with just enough modern production to keep it sounding current, while never tampering with Stevie's classic rock sound. It's perfectly progressive without sounding trendy. And with each listen, this collection just becomes more and more addictive. \\"Wide Sargasso Sea, \\" based upon the classic novel by Jean Rhys begins softly and slowly, building into a smashing rocking and rolling frenzy complete with Nicks' trademark urgent wailing by the end of the song. Annabel Lee is epic, giving props to Edgar Allan Poe. \\"Soldiers Angel\\" is her love song to our wounded soldiers in the military. \\"New Orleans\\" dedicates healing, strength and love to that city that is still rebuilding from the hurricane disaster. \\"Ghosts are gone\\" is a flat out rocker that recalls classic Nicks. \\"Italian summer\\" is gorgeous, with it's violins, romantic vibes, and Stevie's seductive voice ending the song by holding a long final note that sounds simply gorgeous. This album is amazingly artistic, with Stevie Nicks in peak form. While the reviews say this is Stevie Nicks' best album since \\"Bella Donna,\\" let me say \\"Trouble in Shangri la\\" was also revered as such. So, in closing, I will say this is Stevie Nicks at her best, ranking amongst her best material. Although 10 years was a very long time for fans to get a new solo set from Nicks, it was well worth waiting for. Let us hope we won't have to wait 10 more years for the next album. This proves Stevie Nicks is in no way done. She is back, in peak form, and has much more music to share with the world. Rock on Ancient Queen.s, it was well worth waiting for. Let us hope we won't have to wait 10 more years for the next album. This proves Stevie Nicks is in no way done. She is back, in peak form, and has much more music to share with the world. Rock on Ancient Queen.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|I found this DVD in a pawn shop for 2 bucks and decided to give it a shot since I love sci-fi of all sorts and I had read some reviews here.  Here is my problem with this movie - the whole idea is from an old joke, 'did you hear about the morons who are planning a space trip to the sun, its OK. they're going at night'.  And that is the problem with this movie.  But not only is that the dumbest idea ever, they're taking some device that will re-light the dying sun.  The crew members seeem to be along for the ride so they can make mistakes, endanger the mission,  fight with each other, and save humanity, the earth, all life, and even the solar system.  I'm glad there is a real scientist who is doing commentary for this film, he should on the next ship to the Sun.   They should have sent an unmanned computerized ship and skipped this movie all together.    I enjoy escapist sci-fi like Star Wars and more serious hard sci-fi like 2001 or Moon, but this kind of nonsense wrapped in a shroud of 'real science' is junk.  Written by college drop outs for high school drop outs.
B004K4IZ3G|3.0|The original TRON had more story. The original special effects of the original movie were original ideas to back-up the storyline, and with that, writing for the original movie was believable and could stand on it own. TRON: LEGACY, the special effects carried the movie and where is a plot. It seems like the writing for the plot was an after thought. The race scene was dazzling, but it did not have the same sense of purpose as in the original. It seems that the special effects is what the movie is all about. For those who saw the original TRON and heard that there is a sequel coming out, ask yourself what did you remember? Was it the special effects or was it the plot in it environment?

B004I4H8QI|5.0|&quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; would remain one of Eric Clapton's seminal albums and his best as a band leader. This latest 40th anniversary reissue goes back to the original mixes for this set. Although the best version I've heard is the Mobile Fidelity this version is a good solid choice if that isn't available. The sound here is pretty good as mentioned although there is some soft limiting applied as well as some compression but this edition for a contemporary remaster sounds quite nice if not perfect. I don't think most of you fans will really notice these minor flaws.<br /><br />I would suggest for fans to go with the two CD edition or for uberfans to go for the deluxe edition that has vinyl, the two CD edition, the Derek and the Dominos &quot;Live at the Filmore&quot; release as well as some cool collectables. Be aware however that there have been some problems with the packaging/shipping so if you end up ordering it inspect your package very careful.<br /><br />The second disc of the album has the Dominos appearing on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot; as well as  a mix of previously released materail (from &quot;Crossroads&quot;)much of which has been been remixed and Bobby Whitlock adding the finishing touches (backing vocals, organ, etc.) to the unfinished version of &quot;Got To Get Better In A Little While&quot; that was slated for the cancelled second Dominos album.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I was contemplating replacing my older car stereo CD player because it couldn't support mp3s.  That would have been rather expensive, and I wasn't looking forward to tearing up the dash to make it happen.  Then I got wind of this player that made attaining the goal easy and inexpensive.  The only potential drawback, interference on the broadcast channel -- but I'm happy to say that hasn't been a problem at all (so far).  Your mileage may vary, but I'm a very happy camper.  You could be too.
B004L3AQFG|5.0|It's a question that the Saw film franchise has been asking for seven films: how far would you go to survive? Would you harm a stranger, or someone you loved? Would you do the nigh unthinkable and cut off a limb? 127 Hours asks this as well, but with two big exceptions: The first is that it's based on a true story, and second, it's actually good.    Directed by Danny Boyle (28 Days Later, Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire), 127 Hours tells the true story of Aron Ralston, a hiker and canyoneer who, in 2003, was hiking in Utah's Blue John canyon when his arm became trapped under a heavy boulder. After being trapped for five days, Ralston amputated his right arm using a dull pocket knife and walked out of the canyon.    Based on Ralston's book, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, the film faced an extremely difficult challenge: how does one make a feature length film where the story boils down to \\"guy trapped in a canyon for a long time\\"? It's a challenge that Danny Boyle, and more impressively, star James Franco (Milk, Spider-Man) meet head on. In front of the camera, Franco hits the mark almost like Robin Hood: from goofy adventurer to seriously considering the very immediate issue of his mortality, his performance never once descends into the realm of camp.    What really helps to pull the film together is the editing, balanced between beautiful wide shots of Utah's landscapes, up close and personal shots of James Franco, and music video-like hallucinations, with many shots cut together in quick succession to not only condense what is going on, but to ramp up the intensity of the moment as well. The film's editors are very skilled, piecing together the various elements without ever once giving it the feeling that there is a case of Dissociative Personality Disorder going on, nor slowing down the film's break-neck pace.     Where the film could have gone horrendously wrong was the amputation scene. The scene is cut together very quickly, and never lingers on any graphic image for too long. The soundtrack really amps up the intensity, and when it was all over, I found myself holding my breath for the duration. The whole scene was done in one take with multiple cameras and took about twenty minutes to shoot, and is condensed to a brief two to three minute montage. Just be careful if you decide to take hold of someone's hand during this part - you may very well end up breaking it.     There is a slight problem with character development, or lack thereof. During Ralston's many hallucinations, he is taunted by images of his ex-girlfriend (Clémence Poésy). It's apparent that their relationship ended badly, and we are shown the how, but never the why. Several times we also \\"see\\" a number of people sitting on a couch observing Ralston, but only a handful of them are ever identified: namely his parents, sister, and co-worker. Who are the other ten or so people, and why are they so important that we see them?     127 Hours was given a wide release just in time for the awards season, and received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Regardless of how many golden statues those involved take home on February 27, 127 Hours is a very strong film: part documentary, part drama, part thriller, all held together with an excellent performance by James Franco and another great piece of work by director Danny Boyle. Running a scant 90 minutes, it never outstays its welcome, and the frequent trips into Ralston's mind held break up the monotony of being stuck in a canyon. It certainly won't appeal to everyone, but then again, what does?
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I love magical stories whether they are intended to be magical or the magic is in the very nature of the story's reality. I totally enjoyed this rare little film that deserves more exposure, especially by the independent film audience and those who enjoy literary fiction. Wow! I couldn't wait to get my own copy of this film after happening upon it in Netflix.
030726999X|4.0|A great third installment of the trilogy.<br /><br />This book, like the others is hard to stop reading and put down.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Was fortunate enough to see this in Asia in a reclining seat ...<br /><br />This movie was a lot of fun. The actors acquitted themselves wonderfully, although Natalie Portman's part could have been played by most anybody. The lead was charismatic and humorous as the brash Thor, who has a lot to learn about being the next King of Asgard. Hopkins is inimitable and fierce as Odin, and Loki is well-cast and well-played, the brooding competitor to the throne.<br /><br />Ultimately it is a story about fathers and sons, and the tragic ways in which we may choose to gain their approval, which makes for some surprises. Although most of the plot is telegraphed, it is nevertheless touching, and you will find yourself rooting for reconciliation. It is a joy to behold the script, the acting, and the SFX. Asgard is a sight to see, and the clash between the mortal Thor and his new habitation in New Mexico makes for some great gags. \\"I like this drink. Bring me another!\\" and his brief quest for a steed are sure to bring some chuckles.<br /><br />The Frost Giants are so-so as far as FX, but there are plenty of thundering scenes, with or without Mjolnir. You will see the four friends face off with the Destroyer and a pretty multicultural Asgard, among other things. The setting is not quite as epic as expected, being set in a smallish town, but of course the stakes are high nevertheless.<br /><br />Doyle's score is suitably rousing and grand, although the main theme - that is, the sequence of primary notes of the theme -  is unremarkable, at least on first hearing, unlike his memorable \\"Henry V.\\"<br /><br />Watch for the short blurb after the credits.
0345528581|5.0|If you're curious about trying bodyweight training you should buy this book. You will NOT be disappointed!    The book covers topics such as \\"Classic Cardio vs High Intensity Interval Training\\", \\"What is fitness?\\", Nutrition, etc. Then it gets down to business and the rest of the book is all about the bodyweight exercises, followed by the superb 10-week training program which is escalating in intensity. There are four different 10-week programs, depending on your current level of fitness, which is separated into \\"Beginner\\", \\"1st Class\\", \\"Master Class\\" or \\"Chief Class\\".    I am a 31 year old man and have been working out in gyms on and off for 14 years and my fitness level is decent. I have read countless books and magazines on weight training. I have been using the methods found in \\"You Are Your Own Gym\\" for 25 days now and I'm so happy with the results. Buying this book was the best thing I've done so far this year. I cancelled my membership at the local gym, for which I paid about six times the price of this book every month!    Five strong stars for \\"You Are Your Own Gym\\". Highly recommended!
B0019T9FL6|5.0|DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM punhana.  I paid and never received the item.  I contacted the seller multiple times and never received a response. Trying to be nice, I waited for the item or a response for too long, so that I wasn't able to file a claim with Amazon or leave seller feedback.  Do not buy anything from him.  Read his feedback, others have had this experience.  The CD itself is wonderful, just buy it from someone else.

B0049P1VHS|4.0|Season 1 very intense viewing and enjoyable for the undead tv series that I'm surprised to see that is televised for AMC for the very graphic nature that you would see at a box office theater!  Looking forward for season 2 this coming fall of human survival & interaction between strangers facing day to day uncertainty of humanity & the undead plague of the 21st century?
B004PFNQTI|5.0|Bought the 1st season on dvd last week, watched it(for the first time), loved it and couldnt wait for season 2 to come out on dvd...buying it on amazon was a GREAT save on time and convenience! My favorite show at the moment...! ... Damon's bad-ass!
0307272702|3.0|Taubes asks good questions, but is intellectually dishonest in some answers.    Mr Taubes certainly asks the right questions. Why are we getting fat, even in populations that seemingly don't have enough food? Why are diets hard to stick to? Why is exercise not automatically going to assist in weight loss? These, and many other questions, are very pertinent. Taubes does a decent job of reviewing \\"some\\" of the research literature to bring the need to show these questions.    But his answers are weak. There are many that I could see, and I'm sure others that I'm not knowledgeable enough address / correct that others can.    1) For instance, Taubes tries to discredit the importance the Energy Balance equation in weight loss. He says that it's not calories in and out that matter. He then goes on to discuss how fat is gained first, which then forces the body to demand more intake of food. Or decreased in activity. And he uses this as proof that calories don't matter. Actually, it further proofs that they do!    First, you CANNOT have a change in MASS of your body without an increase in MASS consumed vs MASS burned (oxidized). This is really, really, fundamental. You can't create mass from nothing. Taubes is correct that you can first convert some mass to fat, then as for more mass to be taken in, so that the cause / effect are reversed, but even still, mass balance is still a law.    Energy balance (or thermodynamics if you want) law basically says Energy In (food) = Metabolic rate + Food Breakdown Energy + Subconscious Energy (aka NEAT, nervous energy) + Exercise + Change in Weight    **ATTENTION** This is a CONSTRAINT. It is not the ONLY constraint. Taubes illustrates that there are OTHER constraints too (such as, if you exercise more, you are going to tend to eat more as well). But that does not discredit the energy balance constraint. And all the controlled research verifies this.     So Taubes says, 'energy balance doesn't matter', 'carbs matter'. FALSE. Energy balance does matter, and yes maybe carbs matter too. Again, multiple constraints.    This fundamental communication really matters, because people tend to look at things as black/white, and if they read \\"calories don't matter\\", well they propagate that and interpret as \\"I can eat as much as I want\\", which is false.     2) Taubes attempts to simply the fat storage / release problem to simply insulin (mentioning only briefly some other hormones that play small roles). But wait, he doesn't mention LEPTIN???? Google \\"Leptin\\". How can you have a book on weight regulation without mentioning leptin?
0743233832|5.0|The Meditations was the first philosophy book I randomly pulled of my parents' shelves when I was a boy of 12.  It was a marvel for me, with the short paragraphs of advice and humble insights from a Roman emperor writing by lamplight in his campaign tent.  It seemed penned directly to me from over 2000 years ago. Magic.  The irony of my adolescent romance with a stoic has amused me since, but there is some logic to it, as I was then starting to manage my own thinking and hormones at the same time while looking for form and guidance from the word outside my immediate family.  The paragraphs were short, and I was inspired that I had discovered this dusty old book, so I could excavate my youthful way through the older, stiffer translation.<br /><br />I'm nearly 50 now, and have been revisiting some of the Greek and Roman classics, delighted that new scholars have revisited these works again with our present-day linguistic, dramatic, and cultural traditions in mind.  My own son is nearly 12, and he can read this new version of The Meditations easily when I share fragments with him.  We can get right to the ideas without the added challenge of the older English.  (A 19th century linguistic adventure is worthwhile too, but one challenge at a time...)  As a dad, I often come back to the ancient classic questions with my son.  I often crudely rarify these as:<br /><br />- What is the nature of things?  (What's up?)<br />- What should I/you/we do next?  (What now?)<br /><br />I highly recommend this new work for stimulating your thinking and approach to these prime questions.<br /><br />Happy (stoic) reading!
B004TL0J5M|5.0|Another fantastic book by Michael Connelly. Very easy to read and hard to put down. Can't wait for the next installment to come out in this magnificient series.<br /><br />Ignore the bad reviews as they all relate to price and have no business showing as a bad review for a great story. If you don't like the price, go out and buy the hard copy.
B004X0XA82|3.0|I liked some of Fleet Foxes' previous music so I downloaded this new album while it was a specially-priced download.     I felt it sounded very much like their previous work, but that something was lacking and that at times the songs didn't go anywhere in particular.      However, this impression (and expectation) comes from someone who is not a Fleet Foxes fan. To be more specific- I don't claim to know anything about the band, not even the names if the musicians.     If you are looking for more informative and knowledgeable observations, I humbly direct you to my fellow reviewers (and the song samples available at Amazon).
B004Q1FDHO|4.0|i did get a few laughs out of blowing up fish and shooting ducks but it seemed hard for me to want to play the game any further to accomplish anything. so only giving it 4 stars who knows maybe i just have a short attention span lol. other then that it ran perfectly well on my samsung vibrant 4g froyo 2.2 (not rooted) have uninstalled it still thanx amazon :)
0802130208|1.0|The characters are not interesting; they're just stupid people with some eccentricities.  I got 7/8 through the book and was never amused, moved, or had any interest in the people, their world, or the plot (what little there is of it.)  I'm not even going to bother to save the book and try again later.  To me, it's simply crap.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Pretty much one of the best games ever. great to play anytime, especially if u just have a few minutes to kill.
B00386EZJU|5.0|Awesome film score. Love the music. This really helped make the movie great. Wish it had the compilation that is played during the credits though and not the pointless track \\"the vikings have their tea\\"
B00006AG5N|4.0|I gave this to my 11 yo daughter as a birthday gift to encourage her exploration of music.  It is now sharing space in her heart with an anthology of the Beatles.  Good overview of the work of The King of Rock and Roll.  Next anthology? Maybe The Clash or Gang of Four.
B001E5CH0G|4.0|This is my wife's favorite Christmas movie. I bought it for her, and it came in great condition. No one really should be subject to seeing Will Ferrel in 1080p, but you get what you pay for lol.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It is definitely my favorite item.   What I love about this app is that I can use \\"color\\" to classify the notes.   It functions like \\"folder\\". What a unique and smart idea!   I also like reminder function and check list.   I make check list for the work that I have to finish every morning. It really helps me a lot.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Loreena is an outstanding, one-of-a-kind artist.  Her voice, vocal style, lyrics, arrangements, and instruments are a true fascination to hear.  Her ventures and interests are blended with her music to create classic images.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|Finally, a movie in the Harry Potter series that doesn't stray to some ridiculous, last minute, oddly invented, fake plot, and instead actually stays true to the originally written book.    However, what is in fact unfortunate is that 'Warner Brothers' waited until the last movie to actually go by the book, hence the two parts.    - Basically:    * If you are a true fan of the books: You will LOVE and greatly ENJOY the film, as it is plainly put \\"The book coming to life before your eyes\\".    * If you aren't a follower: You will still ENJOY the movie. It has some amazing cinematography! Yet, at times, it may seem a bit complex to a handful of viewers, this is because not everything is explained in detail as it is in the book, nevertheless this does not at all inhibit the audience from enjoying the magnificence of the film.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A GREAT MOVIE ALL AROUND! A MUST SEE! A++++++ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
B004Q1FDHO|3.0|As other reviewers have said, this is a surprisingly intricate, well-designed game. But it's  not very well-made, and it crashes constantly; and not just the program itself,  it locks up my phone and requires a full reboot. Very frustrating.
0307477479|3.0|Although I got caught up in some of the individual stories ( loved Safari in Best Short Stories of 2010), I just cannot understand why this was chosen to merits the recognition it is receiving. The form is not an innovation. It has been used before and, I believe, better executed in \\"Cloud Atlas\\" by Mitchell and \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" by McCann. The latter book is one of \\"redemption and beauty\\" as described by   Frank McCourt.    The characters here are lost souls, unredeemed and frequently ugly, but I guess that was the point.   This book left me cold and empty.      Very difficult to read on a Kindle due to the PowerPoint slides.
0307272702|4.0|I listened to the audio version of this book.    I have read several books on the Paleo diets and life style.  I thought their agenda was questionable until I read this book.  \\"Why We Get Fat\\" put a lot of this into perspective.    This is what I learned:  1.  The failure to lose weight is not a reflection of the level of effort.  2.  People are different, and a diet that works for one, might not work for others.  3.  Our body is constantly changing and our diets need to change over time.  4.  Very simplisticly, calories from carbs gets sent to fat where it is stored while calories from fish, fowl, and beef get sent to muscle where it is burned.  5.  Its carbs, not calories.  6.  This is not a diet book, but the author was able to explain to me why I might be be struggling with losing 10-20 lbs.  7.  His plan is relatively simple.  Its not just about eating less, its more about not staying hungry.  8.  Accomodates the individual.  Results will not be the same to multiple physical, genetic, and lifestyle differences.    Again, I listened to the audio version of this book.  I will buy the book.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|This is not a Katy Perry record. You really have to listen to these amazing songs more than a couple of times to realize how meaningful and tuneful they are.

B000059XUO|5.0|Ok so it took me a few years to find this one.  One day I was flipping the channels and the show came on called the crow stairway to heaven.  I enjoyed it and then remembered a movie came out with the same name.  Had to buy and watch..<br />Shame this was Brandon Lees last movie. I think he had potential.<br /><br />The movie was good, a bit on the dark side but those kind of movies are like that,  just think of Batman, dark scenes.<br /><br />I ejoyed it and I'll most likely watch it again
B004IFYMYI|4.0|Taxi Driver is not an easy film to watch, it's both gritty and confronting at times, and the depiction of New York as an \\"open sewer\\" is pretty depressing. That said it is an important film in the history of cinema, not the least because it serves as an interesting glimpse of society in the time in which in was made. De Niro's performance is a standout, but all the actors play their parts extremely well. It's hard to come away unaffected by Taxi Driver, and to me that's the mark of a great film. The Blu-ray edition looks great considering the age of this film, though it's obviously not as sharp as recent releases. This Blu-ray worked fine in my region B player.
B004UC1WN8|4.0|JLO's new album \\"Love\\" has been in the making for quite some time. Remember last year when she tried releasing promo single \\"Fresh out the Oven\\" or the widely panned \\"Louboutins\\" as the first single with a premiere performance at the 2009 AMA's where she took that infamous tumble. She took a step back and saw that this mid-tempo r&b/pop-hop sound wasn't working for her like it used to and turned her sights on dance/pop hit-maker RedOne (of Lady Gaga fame) to give us club banger, dance-pop hit \\"On The Floor\\" which zoomed up the charts all over the world and became her first Top 5 in the US in almost a decade. Not only did she hit up Gaga's producer, JLO went straight to the source and gets assistance from Lady Gaga herself, who gets writing/production credits on two tracks on the album.<br /><br />After listening to the album, I can clearly divide it into three musical genres.<br />Quite honestly, the R&B/Pop-Hop section sounds most dated and reminds me most of old-school J-LO tracks from the early 2000's. Good Hit and I'm Into You are the standout tracks from this genre.<br />The Dance/Pop section is the freshest and contains some serious gems, ie: Villains and Hypnotics along with first single On The Floor are standouts.<br />The Pure Pop section contains the title track, Love, which is a great HOT AC track. Except for the weak, Everybody's Girl, these are some great modern pop tracks and JLO hasn't sounded better.<br /><br />Dance/Pop<br />1 - On The Floor<br />2 - Papi<br />3 - Invading My Mind - Co-Produced and Co-written by RedOne and Lady Gaga.<br />4 - Villains - This is a smoking hot track, in the vein of Jump Smokers meets - Cheryl Cole's \\"Fight For This Love\\"<br />5 - Hypnotico - Send this to RADIO ASAP - Should fit in perfectly in between a Ke$ha and Britney track. Another RedOne/Lady Gaga production.<br />6 - Charge Me Up<br /><br />R&B/Pop-Hop<br />1 - Good Hit - Very Hot Beat - Standard R&B formula with label lyrics and all. Produced by Tricky & The Dream.<br />2 - I'm Into You feat. Lil Wayne - 2nd Single - This is JLO's \\"Rude Boy\\" produced by Stargate<br />3 - Run The World - Filler track produced by Tricky & The Dream<br />4 - One Love - Filler track from Danja who actually produced a total of 4 tracks with JLO. Only 2 made the final cut.<br />5 - Take Care - This bonus track is catchier than some of the fillers in this section. Produced by Tricky Stewart.<br /><br />Pure Pop<br />1 - (What is) Love? - Written by Wynter Gordon<br />2 - Until It Beats No More<br />3 - Starting Over - Produced by Danja<br />4 - Everybody's GirlO's \\"Rude Boy\\" produced by Stargate  3 - Run The World - Filler track produced by Tricky & The Dream  4 - One Love - Filler track from Danja who actually produced a total of 4 tracks with JLO.

030746363X|2.0|The promises of the book are exciting, and sure, I'll give it a go, but it's going to take four hours just to go through and take notes on all the throwaway tips he mentions once (glowingly) and then figure out how to use them together. Grapefruit juice, for example. Somewhere in the book, he does mention a benefit of drinking it. It does not appear in the index, however, and when I did manage to find the page (but sadly, not mark the spot) at lunch yesterday, I was frustrated to see that he didn't say when to take it, or how (or whether) to combine it with his other blood-sugar regulating-substances suggested, cinnamon and lemon juice. The chapter on cinnamon and lemon juice, which have the same purpose, doesn't even mention it.<br />I might have to go back to his sample binge day log -- NOT a typical diet day -- for clues on how to actually use his tips. Wouldn't, say, a complete shopping list and hourly dosing schedule for 1 week of food and supplements have been appropriate for a book with so much space devoted to a specific diet plan? I'm actually flipping through it as I write this to see who to blame, but there's no editor. Mr. Ferriss can fill a book with frothy anecdotes, amazing discoveries, and throwaway references all he likes, apparently, without having to pull anything together. I'm not impressed. When he gets an editor, I'll consider buying another of his books.

B004UC1WN8|5.0|This album is everything I expected. Every track is special, it will transmit some emotion to you. The album has amazing dance-tracks like \\"On The Floor\\" or \\"Good Hit\\" and inspirational ballads like \\"Until It Beats No More\\". I really have nothing bad to say about this album. Jennifer Lopez is stronger than ever and she proves she was never gone. Buy this deluxe edition, the extra songs are worth it!
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I had some hesitation towards this album, since I've seen so many albums being overhyped in the past year. But if you like music, real music, you'll love this album. This album reminds me of \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" and \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose\\". All songs are solid and the sound quality is impressive. \\"Bridge Burning\\" and \\"These Days\\" are my favorite songs so far.
0670022411|5.0|I loved Discovery of Witches - and that surprised me.  Although I do enjoy some fantasy I have stayed away from vampire books like they carried the plague.  I do love history though and eagerly await the follow-up to this book.  It was captivating!
0060899220|5.0|This is one of those books that you'll finish reading in a day or two, then think about how simple it is.  Its just Anthony Bourdain talking about his life, his experience, the daily occurrences in the kitchen culture, and takes you from a guy at rock bottom who worked hundreds of jobs until he was on top.  I'm not sure if he meant it to be inspirational, but this book is enough to make anyone want to get it together and make things happen.
0756405890|5.0|I've read a lot of fantasy, sci-fi, and \\"literature\\" books, and I have found this story to be one of the most amazing and intriguing that I've ever read.

B004HO6I4M|4.0|The best single word I can use to describe the film Rio is 'vibrant' as it's the colors that really hit you.  One can see why, when you're doing a story about birds, setting it in Brazil with its dazzling variety of brilliantly multicolored avian species is a truly inspired choice.<br /><br />The story begins when a baby blue macaw in the Brazilian rain forest falls (literally) into the hands of exotic animal poachers and ends up being shipped to the US where, by a fortunate accident, he ends up being adopted by a young girl named Linda in a small town in, of all places, wintry Minnesota.  A quick flash forward shows girl and bird, which she names Blu, growing up together, to fifteen years later where Linda is now an adult who owns her own bookstore. The thing is though, Blu, raised as a house-bird, never learned how to fly.<br /><br />The plot really begins when a Brazilian ornithologist named Tulio comes to Linda's store, having learned from her web-site that she's the owner of Blu, who apparently is one of the last male blue macaws in the world. Despite getting off on the wrong foot with Linda, he eventually persuades her to come with him to Brazil so that they can mate Blu with a female blue macaw named Jewel that they've managed to capture. Once there, however, the mating plan hits a snag as Jewel wants only to escape back to her jungle and has nothing but disdain for Blu, who only wants to get back with his human.  Further complications set in when both birds are stolen by exotic animal black-marketeers who intend to sell them to the highest bidder. The two birds, though chained together, manage to escape, but it's rough going, particularly when Jewel discovers that Blu can't fly and she can't fly away while she's chained to him, and the bird thieves are hot on their trail, right in the middle of Brazil's biggest and most flamboyant of all festivals, Carnival.<br /><br />Director/writer Carlos Saldanha goes the distance in bringing some authentic Brazilian touches to the film. I particularly liked the way in which he brought out how everyone in Brazil is soccer-crazy, with good guys and bad constantly being distracted whenever a game is on.<br /><br />The themes are familiar ones - characters are thrust out of their familiar environments into ones they find strange and challenging, characters who don't get along but are stuck together learn to appreciate each other, danger threatens, help comes from unexpected quarters, fears are overcome, and so on - but the characters in Rio are engaging and the story-telling is well done so you just lean back and enjoy the show. And Rio is a true visual pleasure to watch just for the sheer vibrancy of its colors and for the exotic setting of Rio de Janeiro during Carnival.<br /><br />The voice actors for the most part do a creditable job bringing their characters to life. The stand-outs are clearly Jesse Eisenberg (The Social Network) as Blu and Anne Hathaway (The Devil Wears Prada) as Jewel, who succeed in not only bringing out the individual personalities of the two macaws but also make you believe in the way the two birds gradually begin to accept and relate to each other. But Leslie Mann and Rodrigo Santoro are also exceptional as the humans Linda and Tulio, Mann for bringing out Linda's mix of independence and introvert and Santoro for Tulio's engagingly manic if clumsy extrovert.  Comedic actor Tracy Morgan has fun voicing Luiz, a Carnival-loving bulldog whose bark may be worse than his bite but whose drool trumps both. And Jermaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) adds a deliciously nasty touch as the villainous cockatoo, Nigel.<br /><br />(Note: I was wondering why a Brazilian cockatoo was talking with what sounded like an Australian accent, but I later found out that cockatoos are in fact of Australasian origin. So chalk up another point for Rio for being educational as well as entertaining.)<br /><br />The songs are enjoyable if largely forgettable but nicely add to the Brazilian atmosphere. The stand-out exception is the song Nigel sings (as near as I can tell, it's simply called \\"Nigel's Song\\") where he explains why he is \\"not a pretty bird\\".  There seems to be some kind of rule, in recent years anyway, that in any animated musical film, the bad guys always get the best songs.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys beautifully colored  animation, engaging characters and good basic storytelling.zilian atmosphere.

B001GM28HO|5.0|When one makes machine-pop, where every song is made by the same batch of producers and writers, it is a mighty feat to make yourself stand above the crowd. Lady Gaga, who follows the long tradition of everyone from Yma Sumac to Madonna, elevates herself over the mundanities of popular music by sheer force of personality. Add that she's a prodigy and an expert musician, and you get a sense that \\"The Fame\\" is more than just a run-of-the-mill pop album.<br /><br />It took me a considerable amount of time to warm up the Lady Gaga. The songs on the fame are all state of the moment dance music, and her flamboyance often overshadows just how good these songs are. As co-writer of all the songs here, Gaga is also a step up the creative ladder. She knows a good ear-worm when she pens one, which is why tricky lines in \\"Pokerface\\" or \\"Lovegame\\" just don't leave your head. Gaga also knows that titillation is just as good as the best hook, so a touch of naughty is as infallible as the best hook. That may be the best lesson she copped from Madonna, but \\"The Fame\\" holds its own musically after repeat listens.<br /><br />She also has enough change-ups to knock aside thoughts that Gaga is nothing but a dance-diva. \\"Brown Eyes\\" is the kind of song Gwen Stefani wishes she could still write, and \\"Eh Eh, Nothing else I can Say\\" is genial pop. It's clear that Gaga is concerned about the craft of her work, but she also loves the spotlight. It's tough not to invoke Elton John or David Bowie, performers who reinvented their daily life as wild, over the top characters, but Gaga does so repeatedly in her music (of course, in her shows as well). She wants it all, both the fame and the cred, even as she approaches it from the outside in. \\"The Fame\\" is, like her or not, the birth of the decade's first serious pop-diva.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|The app is great, but paying for pro is useless. All you get is the ability to record. The record feature would be great but attempting to skip ahead on recordings just causes it to restart. I went pro hopping I can listen to local radio show without all the ads. Can't do it so it was a waste.
B004G600A4|5.0|At first i didnt think it was going to be so great. But this movie holds an important lesson to not let go of your dreams
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Works very well.  I only wish it was easier to get to edit appointments you make on this calendar.  But very nice to look at appointments on monthly view.  Over all like this product using it on HTC Evo 4G.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I bought this based on the Amazon reviews and it more than lives up to the high rating.    1) The FM transmitter is very powerful, I have encountered no static or signal loss keeping it tuned to 88.7 driving from Southern New Hampshire to Cape Cod.  I have tried several others transmitters from Belkin, Griffin, etc. and this beats them easily.    2) The capability to play from an SD card or USB stick is a huge bonus.  Can handle up to a 32GB card.    3) Remote is handy while driving, no need to look and lean over to fiddle with buttons.    4) The cable on this Soundfly AUX unit is a standard 3.5mm - 3.5mm at each end and is roughly 2 feet long.  Note that the cable for the other Soundfly SD WMA/MP3 Player is 2.5mm at input end and 3.5mm at the MP3 player end and is only 10 inches long.  This Soundfly AUX unit also has an AUX output so you can continue to use this device when you upgrade your vehicle to one with an AUX input.
B004SBX112|4.0|Not a bad game, lot of fun and variety.  Not bad at all works great on HTC Evo 4G.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I grew up with this movie and even as an adult it is still one of my very favorite movies. It's a classic fairytale the everyone can really sit down and enjoy.
B004132HZS|5.0|I didn't think I'd enjoy a modern twist on the classic Sherlock Holmes. Most remakes of anything tend to be awful, so I was fully prepared to hate \\"Sherlock.\\" For the first 15 minutes or so of the first episode, \\"Study in Pink,\\" I didn't think I liked the show because the actor playing Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) was super annoying. However, he grew on me very quickly, and I realized it's not the actor who irritated me, it's the character of Sherlock himself, which is exactly the way he's supposed to be, and Cumberbatch is perfectly cast as this brilliant sociopath. He has a great on-screen rapport with Martin Freeman, who plays Dr. John Watson.<br /><br />Obviously, the show takes many liberties with the original books and stories, since this series is set in modern-day London. There are only three episodes in Season One which is a bit of a disappointment, but each episode is about 90 minutes long without commercials, so it's basically like watching three short films. Each episode is witty and fast-paced, and I was glued to the television the entire time. Sometimes I feel that there are some minor discrepancies in the show that don't make much logical sense (none of the morgue workers realizing that a cut in a body was made hours after the person was dead, etc.), but the show as a whole is so good that I am willing to overlook the little things. I am very eager to watch Season Two when it premieres!
1439130833|5.0|This book is the original for me. It is what first put me on a \\"spiritual\\" path. I have since then read many other books and based my life upon the principles. This book puts things into \\"elementary\\" form for the average person to actually be able to soak up.
B004FUPK3I|4.0|Huge upgrade from the standard dvd. Solid transfer, great detail and color, nice black tone, contrast and sharpness is great. Some scenes have a heavy grain, some scenes have no grain, but it's a small distraction, it's true to the source. Audio is really good. Compared to a flawless older title Blu-ray transfer like Tron or Flash Gordon, the picture is a B, audio B+.
B0002NRQTS|5.0|The title probably says enough, but really this is my favorite Rush album. I love Rush's '80s output as much as any other era in their existence, but there was always one problem with this era for them: poor Alex got his guitar buried in the mix. Presto corrects this, and Alex's guitar co-exists with the keyboards quite nicley. No instrument feels like it has its role diminished on this album.    But of course the songwriting is really what makes or breaks an album, and the songwriting on Presto is just superb. Every song on the album brings something to the table, and Red Tide is the most underrated song in their catalog.     I will have to admit though, when I first heard this album I didn't like it. It took a lot of listening, but I eventually warmed up to it. Based on what I have read online previously, I don't seem to be alone about that either, so my suggestion to newcomer Rush fans is to not start with this album. Pick up the undeniable classics 2112 and Moving Pictures first, and my personal recommendation, Grace Under Pressure, before going exploring in their catalog.
0783233477|5.0|Hello:  I recently received my order.  I was eager to watch the movie.   I saw it once and loved it, BUT it came to be that the movie was REGION I and I am in Guatemala, Central America (Region 4).  The \\"region information\\" was not specified when I requested the item.  I own a \\"home theatre\\" at home, but ended up watching the movie in my lap top. Too bad!
B00005N6KG|3.0|You get what your pay for. Sound quality is fair but has to be played at full volume to get the same level that I get at one third volume using by Sony MDR-AS30 ear phones. The Sony MDR-W08's feel great just not much output. Not bad for the price, however I think I will pay a little more and get some better earphone. The Sony MDR-AS30's are good earphone just not comfortable especially if worn for a long period of time.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Like so many others, all I want are the original theatrical versions on bluray. None of the special edition crap with stupid/pointless/odd cgi and edited scenes that are a poor attempt at patching together very different stories. Just the OT theatrical version on bluray. It really isn't that hard...all the others did it so why can't you lucas moneycorp? I refuse to buy this and will continue to wait for the real Original Trilogy to be released in a format that doesn't mock all those who were part of the original experience.
0061564893|1.0|i got this book because gleen beck recommended it, but the book is out there. Has some neat facts, but the conclusion of some of it is far out there.
032147404X|5.0|This book is excellent. It is very well written and has the bare bones information that you need to take your photography to the next level. The author has a great sense of humor and presents the information in a way that is not dull. I bought the book a short time ago and have already read it cover to cover several times and used many of the techniques outlined in it. I have picked up the second book in the series and expect that I will order the third also. It is that good.
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|So we have a guy moping around feeling cursed at being blessed with a gift.  Then there's the woman who briefly experienced death while being overtakened and nearly drowned by a Tsunami.  She then has visions of the little girl she tried to save. A boy, who loses his twin brother in a horrible accident, and has a drug addicted mom.<br /><br />The movie starts out great as the three stories are introduced.  I was hooked and looking forward to all the possible angles, theories that could have been analyzed about death, dying, and our ultimate stop.  It didn't happen.  It was a story about how death affects three people and the emotions that go along with losing someone, even if that someone is you.<br /><br />Very slow paced, and the ending left alot to be desired.  The last 5 minutes turned into a romantic love story, with our guy Matt practically drooling while he fantasizes like a school boy about kissing and holding a girls hand.<br /><br />I expected a little more from this movie.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|before I review this movie. let me tell you my favorites. it is very hard to judge a review from someone, if you're really not sure you even like the same style..    my top 3 Favorites..... now elena undone, loving annabelle, imagine me & you. I also love,  I can't think straight, claire of the moon, gray matters.  Hope this helps.    this isn't just an absolute must see.  this is an absolute must own.  from start to finish I was enthrawled, inspired, and lost myself in this movie.  I can't seem to watch anything else.     although I am a fan of claire of the moon. this movie truly shows nicole conn at the absolute top of her game. the cinematography, and the script cannot be touched.      the characters not only beautiful, captivate you immediately.  you find yourself embarking on a journey that saddens you when it has to come to a close.  2 women who find friendship, admiration, equality, love and the truth behind the meaning of.....soulmates.      yes, again as in many movies 1 of them of course is married, to top it off her husband is a preacher.  and although it sounds of the typical. lesbian meets straight married woman and converts her,,, bla bla.  it is truly nothing of the sort     Elena has a love for photography.  but of course manages a family so her love for taking pictures takes a backseat.     peyton is a writer, of course the lesbian in the movie.  and finds a real admiration for elena's work.  as does elena for peyton.    how'd they meet is classic.  how this friendship begins is divine.  Elena finds herself attracted to the spirit of peyton and soon doesn't know how to be away from her friend.  Peyton on the other hand, finds herself in a place she never thought she'd be.       this movie also has the longest homosexual or heterosexual on screen kiss in history.       the love scenes , yes I said scenes, plural.  are erotic, passionate, tantalating and show the true depth of love between 2 women.   2 women who fall in love with each other, not thegender that is so common in a lot of lesbian movies.      you'll grow as a person, as u r touched by the kindred spirits of these characters.  you will lose yourself in their world. you will regain faith through their journey. and you will open your heart to believe that you can fall in love all over AGAIN....    this movie is intoxicating and u will want to watch it over and over again. definitely the best money I have ever spent.  there is no way and I repeat no way you could possibly be disappointed in this movie.  finally a movie that totally takes u in.  I laughed,  I cried and I found a reason to believe that my soul mate may still be out there.     trust enough to buy this video.  and let this be one regret you WON'T  have in your life.
0451205766|2.0|As another reviewer said, this book would not be nearly as popular if the movie was not as great as it is. This is one of the few cases where the movie is far superior to the book.     The main problem for me is the writing style, which is simplistic, devoid of any sophistication and polish. I got bored of it after about 100 pages. The conversations are right out of a comic book, the characters, other than the interesting and complex Don, are not much more than a name and a description. The writer does not have enough skill to tell the story in an enganing way. In the hands of a more skilled writer this would have been a fantastic book.    This said, one must give credit where it's due. The author presents a realistic and fascinating (at least, to someone not familiar with the subject) picture of the personal and \\"business\\" life of the underworld honchos and their acolytes, with lots of details. One wonders where he got all that inside information, and if that has ever caused him any trouble in his life. On the other hand, if one is interested in the inner workings of the underworld, it's probably better to read one of the numerous and better written non-fiction books on the subject.
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|As the preview picture displays, a review on the back of the DVD box declares \\"Welcome to your new addiction\\".  They could not have been more right.    As a curious explorer of TV shows in general, I try to discover new shows that would speak to my heart, my soul, my sense of humor, or my brain. This one spoke to my sense of mystery.  \\"Pretty Little Liars\\", with all its intricate intrigues and fascinating characters, got me hooked in no time.    Every single episode leaves you on a cliffhanger, overwhelmed with suspense, and hungry for more.   Hanna, Aria, Emily and Spencer form a strong lead in this addictive show, and seem to unravel after the disappearance of their queen bee, Alison. When it seemed as if this tragedy would continue to drive them apart, an anonymous sender calling him/herself \\"A\\" begins to stalk the four highschool girls and to threaten them with secrets that only Alison knew about them. The plot doesn't seem very exciting when you read this, does it?   Wait until you watch the first episodes. The plot won't matter to you. The whole atmosphere will drive you on its own.    The only thing that prevents me from rating this show 5 stars is the acting, which is sometimes weak when it comes to some of the youngest characters.  However, I have a particular preference for the smart, determined and impressive Spencer who has an unconventional and classic beauty. Troian Bellisario does a great job interpreting this complex character, whose strong and proud façade seems to hide a sensitive and good-hearted young girl.    Some of the characters have such deep layers that you keep waiting for all of them to come peeling off during the season. And so they do, at a perfect pace, giving us more information, and also more substance.    Very similar to the early seasons of Desperate Housewives.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|this CD is classic stevie nicks yet for some reason to me it comes across  as her most personal! i feel like stevie  is here telling me her stories! not a bad song! she sounds great, the songs are all pure STEVIE with all the mystique,  magic, timeless lyric's, and dreamy melodies.  i love each and every song! the pictures in the  booklet are proof  STEVIE  NICKS has always stayed true to who she is. the production is solid,love  listening  to it. it is pure  pleasure  to hear these songs!
B000AAF1U4|5.0|The 1st time I watched just ok but everytime since (many) I enjoy it more and more til it has become my favorite childrens movie.
B0029LHX1W|5.0|I read this book over the course of a few days. I literally couldn't put it down, stealing away to read whenever I could. It was so refreshing to read a page turner like this; I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Installed on htc evo and app works fine. If you want to search for a video press the menu button on your phone and then select search while the app is running. A search bar appears onscreen.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  It has an amazing storyline.  I also appreciate the fact that there is male nudity along with female nudity.  With me being a woman, I hate those movies that were put out just for men depict women's breasts every 5 minutes.  No this show has some goods for both the guys and the girls.  If you have a Starz subscription, you might be able to catch a few scenes for free (with the subscription).
B003N0XDT4|2.0|Awesome DAC/amp for the money.  I'm a basshead so seeing the bass levels 0-3 is a welcome sight.  Highs and mids aren't affected by this device except the bass(used this in conjunction with my Denon ahd2000, Sennheiser HD595).  I'm not sure why it is named Oyaide E7 since when I created a thread about it at headfi.org, Feiao(Fiio representative @ headfi.org) said \\"Oyaide is our exclusive distributor in Japan, there never have Oyaide's E7\\"  So don't worry, the Fiio and Oyaide E7s are one product.    Con: The plastic screen gets easily scratch.  When I'm using my Ultimate Ears triple fi 10 I get static(like when you are rotating the headphone jack to the headphone input) in it. I thought my tri-fi 10 is broken/damage so I tried it on my FiiO E5 and the static is gone.  I'm only using the regular headphone jack from my ipod and not an LOD cable(will arrive within the next two or three weeks, thanks Ibasso<==[/s]).  So I will update if it is gone.
0767810856|2.0|This could have been a very good movie if the language from one of the cops could have been censored.  A shame a movie with a good thought behind it couldn't have been shared with the whole family.  Not suitable for children.
0525951652|5.0|A big, rich, wonderful read!  I learned a lot about the early 20th. Century while being carried away in a great story.
B003NRWW58|4.0|This sci-fi show is about a covert group of individuals who investigate and deal with various incidents involving various beings that enter our world through an ever-widening rift in and around Cardiff, Wales. The head of the group--called Torchwood--is one Captain Jack Harkness who, we discover in the first episode, cannot die for reasons as yet unexplained. He is the only American; the others are British. The group quickly enlists the help of a female police officer who is suspicious about Torchwood's carte blanche authority with certain crime scenes. Definitely has an \\"X Files\\" meets \\"Outer Limits\\" meets Britain feel and appeal. Enjoyable, yet probably not something for children (American, anyway) below the age of sixteen because the show has the occasional nude scene, \\"F\\" bomb, etc. That's British TV for you. I like the fact that it takes place in Cardiff rather than in the usual pedestrian places such as New York, London or Los Angeles. Worth a look.<br /><br />Note: Captain Jack looks like a cross between Mark Harmon and Tom Cruise.
B002ZG997C|5.0|This CD was in great shape and arrived within a reasonable time. I loved the movie and wanted to own a copy for myself and to share with my family. I think it is an inspiring story. Snake Jagger
1881273156|5.0|A+++ Exactly as described!!
B004BLTNJI|1.0|Not the 3D type I was expecting! This is the old red-cyan type 3D, would not even bother.... Since the item didn't clearly state what type it was I kind of feel ripped off, I must say that I have not felt this way before with my Amazon purchases. I hope this is not the begining of a trend. I am gun shy with purchasing 3D movies from Amazon now, they need to fix this lack of communication issue.
0061537969|1.0|I had heard so much about this book. It was a disappointing read. I found it to be preposterous and ridiculous and poorly written. It was trite and mediocre.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|It makes a difference and at this price it is by far the cheapest in it's field. However, that said, don't expect much. You get what you pay for. The power differance is best noticed in earbuds, it doesn't have enough power for on or over ear headphones. I recommend buying it until you can afford something better or if you can already aford somethimg else then buy that option instead.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|Great    I have  the former version DVD,I think it's very good.   I 've got this blurry, it's much improve both audio/video.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Trust me, buy this!!!!!!!!!!! dont waste your time or money on any other brand. liked it so much, bought another one and planning on buying a few more as gifts.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Fortunately, I recently discovered this album seven years after it was released, better later than never.  It took me a while to discover the album because I'm one of those middle-aged men who used to really like rock and roll a long time ago, and just kind of fell away from all the newer stuff (what's up with rap, anyway?), and so I listen mostly to the \\"classic stuff\\" from the 1960s and 1970s.  This is the best rock album I have heard in years and years.  If you are a middle-aged person, you might like it too.    The music is beautiful, uplifting, and transcendent.  Every single song on the album holds up after repeated listenings.  I'd rate this album as equal to the best stuff delivered by The Beatles, Talking Heads, or Wilco.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I initially loved this book......however it is 600 pages and the author truly could have finished in 300.  It was very slow and very boring at points.  I dont care for the damsel in distress and the possessive man themes.  And this novel did not have a real ending as the entire book is a very long and boring set up for the next book.  I think that the author can do much better.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|First of all I'm giving this product 5 stars for a great series and IMO phenomenal packaging. Beware, though. When I first ordered it I realized the second season had two disc 3's and no disc 5. I returned the item and amazon sent me a replacement in less than 24 hours. This one has all the right discs. Also giving amazon 5 stars for great customer service!
B004IQMXD4|4.0|Heard the album two consecutive times, along w/ replays of my favorites. Evaluation: Probably her most coherent, diverse, accomplished work since Bella Donna. Maybe even more significant career-wise. I think this album is kind of an apotheosis of the ethos of Stevie's solo repertoire over the last 30 years: Some of the songs give me flashes of the vibe of BELLA DONNA, others THE WILD HEART, others ROCK A LITTLE, others OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR-ESQUE, others STREET ANGEL-LIKE, and some TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA (unreleased tracks), others distinctive to IN YOUR DREAMS    Favorites so far:  1. Secret Love (still one of the gems, esp. vocally of the collection)  2. Moonlight (not surprised...this should be the next single, echoes of Stand Back and Edge of 17, BRAVO (good rendition of the 1984/5 vocal, too) *What \\"Planets of the Universe\\" could've/should've been vocally.  3. Annabel Lee (probably her \\"Dreams\\" on this album...should be the fourth radio single)  4. Everybody Loves You (this may be the #1 of the album...love the Lennox/Stewart/Dance/New Wave intro...another Classic vocal, should be the 3rd radio release)  5. My Heart (what an improvement on the TISL demo! This extra track is ESSENTIAL to the album experience, another radio favorite)  6. For What It's Worth (reminds me of the B/N, Mirage, and Street Angel eras all in one...wonder who it's about? Another radio player)  7. In Your Dreams (though, as a song, definitely not worthy of title track status, it's a pretty good rocker w/ a pretty good vocal...radio play again)    Stevie's voice and vocal range are much more reminiscent of her \\"fine wine Classic-ish\\" range she had for THE DANCE album and Enchanted Tour 97-98. Steve Real really has helped her out after her bad menopause bout occurred. THANK GOD!, cause it was becoming almost unbearable. Some of the vocals could have been better done, esp. when you hear the diverse ranges she manages on these various songs: She's best keeping her voice in the higher, steadier, whispery range (\\"Secret Love\\", \\"For What It's Worth\\", \\"In Your Dreams\\", \\"Everybody Loves You\\", \\"Moonlight\\" e.g.) which recalls, and even recaptures, her Classic voice at its best. Her monotone vocals are SO grating on my ears. It makes me scratch my head wondering why she chose to sing some songs in that way, when she never would have sounded that way 20-25 years ago...that occasional bass worked in the '70s to '90; after that, it started to become limiting and annoying.    I'm also happy to say that the poetry is as vast an improvement on TISL as the vocals. TISL had lyrics that weren't lyrics: They were prose poems that sounded extremely forced. Most of these songs are poetic and sound like lyrics to be sung. Sometimes I got faint TISL recollections of lines that could've/should've been changed to sound more lyrical and euphonious. This is, of course, nit-picking (I'm a fan since '75 for God's sake, I'm allowed the right..ha-ha), but I wish \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" had been more completeist about Rhys' entire novel -- uh, Rochester and Antoinette were never really in love (arranged marriage): line should have been, \\"The only thing that they did together/Was swim in lust\\". Also, I wish all of the lyrics of \\"Lady From the Mountain\\" had been included, and the same goes for \\"Annabel Lee\\" (the demo still has some extra gems to be heard...shame).     I was a little surprised at the running time for the LP: A full length experience. I guess extra tracks would've been chancy. I did the mental math, and I guess my wishlist running order would've been (if anyone at all cares):    1. Secret Love  2. For What It's Worth  3. In Your Dreams  4. Wide Sargasso Sea  5. New Orleans  6. Moonlight  7. Annabel Lee  8. You Like Me (1986/7 S. Nicks/M. Campbell composition -- Rock a Little era? It's on YouTube)  9. My Heart  10. Soldier's Angel   11.Everybody Loves You  12. Ghost Are Gone  13. You May Be The One  14. Italian Summer  15. Cheaper Than Free  16. Call On Me For Magic (TISL complete outtake...very quality vocal...Stevie just could have sung the first few lines again, and left the rest as is...a great, Broadway-esque way to end the album w/ Classic Stevie falsetto (a la \\"Sorcerer\\") stylings).    There's my 25 cents! Buy it, folks. It's very good.    Hope Stevie's next album is either Fleetwood Mac's next opus, or Stevie's THE SONG OF RHIANNON score/album/animated film project.     I actually feel like those two songs SO should've been on the album (\\"Have No Heart\\" as well, but I need the rocker that is \\"You Like Me\\")    Rating: ***1/2 TO **** Stars (in a way, this is like her RUMOURS and TUSK in terms of her solo career achievement and ambitiousness).  Grammy Nominations: Best Pop Album and Best Pop Vocal Performance (the entire album, since there's too many good vocals); maybe \\"Moonlight\\", \\"In Your Dreams\\" or \\"Annabel Lee\\" could get nods and even wins for Best Rock Performance.    P.S. I hope Dave Stewart releases the full-length documentary/music movie of the album. I'd go to see it on the first day.
B00008DDRX|5.0|Steve Mcqueen has captured the essence and grit involved involved in this sport.  Although it does look like a take on the movie Grand Prix with James Garner. I would suggest bot movies.
B000FCK8ZK|2.0|I bought this book after enjoying the TV series on Showtime.  I thought the book and TV would be similar but different, and they are.  I like the language the author uses, at least in the first 2/3 of the book.  But the book gets just so far and then he hurries up to finish telling the story and the style goes out the window.  It's like the author had a page limit he couldn't go past with this story.  I've seen similar comments in reviews of the other Dexter books.    I've also seen reviews that say the other books are equally similar to the TV show, I was hoping for something more in the books.  I don't think I'll bother reading the rest of the Dexter books, but I will watch the show.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|After reading the first three books in a non stop fashion I found this fourth book boring and I was not excited to pick it up and read it at the end of the day. The characters and plot lines were dull. However as it is the fourth book in the series I guess I have to plod through it. I hope the fifth installment, if it ever gets released, is back to the excitement and the interesting plot lines of the first three.
B00005QZWI|5.0|There is a German picture for the item, but I received one with a cover in English. CD was in great shape, and shipping was fast. Product matched description.
0385341008|4.0|I had heard people talking about this book ever since it was published--countless people I know had read it and loved it--so I bought it; but then I found myself passing it by on my TBR (to be read) shelf time and time again because I wasn't sure it was my cup of tea (as it turns out, I misunderstood what the book was about from the descriptions I was given). Then I met a new friend and neighbor and she kept at me about it, saying I must read it. FINALLY, after close to two years gathering dust on my shelf, I decided to read it. I am SO glad I did!<br /><br />This is the story of a closeknit community of homey folks who live on Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands between England and France, and Juliet, an author from London, who becomes interested in the story of Guernsey's 5-year occupation by the Germans during World War II. The entire story is told through letters, notes and telegrams--from the Guernsey folks to Juliet and back and from Juliet to her friends and publisher and back.<br /><br />Some of the Guernsey folks are eccentric, but they are all (save one) good-hearted, warm and welcoming people. They may not be sophisticated, but they are incredibly charming and genuine. The Society from the book's title is a book club they started during the war to keep them entertained, since they were denied any news from the mainland during the 5 years the Germans occupied their beloved island. (The Potato Peel Pie part of the title is a dish invented by one of the Society's members during the war, when food was scarce.)<br /><br />The authors do a marvelous job of blending deeply tragic events that took place during the war (both on Guernsey and in concentration camps elsewhere) with the charm and humor of the Guernsey people. It is not a depressing war story, though it could have been in another author's hands. It is a story filled with folksy humor, tall tales and a community of loving people who are always there for one another, even in the hardest of times.<br /><br />You will fall in love with these characters and this enchanted place they call home. Even the story of how the book was finished was so in keeping with spirit of the story itself. The original author, Mary Ann Shaffer, took ill and asked her niece, children's book author Annie Barrows, to finish to story. Ms. Shaffer died in 2008, the year the book was published in hardback. What a wonderful legacy Ms. Shaffer has left for her family...and for all of us.br />You will fall in love with these characters and this enchanted place they call home.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|Just got this \\"In Your Dreams\\" album today.  Knew that she had an album coming out in May.  Listened to her first single, \\"Secret Love\\" months ago on the Rolling Stone web site and loved it anticipating the album's release.  Reminded me of the Rumours album sound.  Just perfect.<br /><br />Also listened to the full album two times through streaming on the Rolling Stone web site and thought it was very catchy after my first listen as the songs were in my head.  The second listen was a just as exciting and new again.  What a nice flashback here.<br /><br />The first time I listened to this album I thought it had an old English sound that reminded me other rock band's like Led Zeppelin and Jethro Tull, albeit quite different.<br /><br />Interesting album to see a complete theme throughout the album about a mystical enchanted dream world.  Her voice is just as amazing as ever for a rock musician.  And I might add, there are very few female rock singers voices I love and hers is one of the very best.  Just love it!<br /><br />This album has a mixture of both fast songs and slower ballads.  Should help keep drivers from getting speeding tickets when driving and listening to this album.  Ha!<br /><br />My weakness is that I love all the balls-out rockers the most:  Secret Love, In Your Dreams, Wide Sargasso Sea, Annabel Lee, and Ghosts Are Gone.<br /><br />I can imagine taking the Annabel Lee song and trancing/remixing a la Oakenfold and taking it  to the disco floor in France.  I thought that would be cool, not unlike the way the Foo Fighters tranced their Rope song on their latest album.  Not sure all artists/fans think like I do, but this remixing intrigues me here.<br /><br />Now, I'm going to be the devil here...There are a couple songs where a guy sings and I wish he didn't.  Too monotonic for my taste.  If we had a male singer, I'd pick a melodic, interesting voice like Tom Petty.  Now I know we can't pick here, but if...<br /><br />There's a lot of magic here.  Just cool that Stevie can still mesmerize us with her music!<br /><br />If you like Fleetwood Mac, you will love this too.you like Fleetwood Mac, you will love this too.
0345529057|5.0|This series is one of the best ever.  Yes George has been a bit tardy with this series, but id rather read the books and risk never getting to the end, than to pass up such a wonderful literary mind.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Britney Spears is always ahead on music, she always bring new things to the table, and blow our minds with great songs! Femme Fatale in my opinion ( and in music critics and herself Britney's opinion) is her best album yet!
B000002O96|5.0|I'm not gonna go into a long thing here, as I don't consider myself a blues aficionado.  But this is the best blues party I have been invited to in a long time.  Three distinctive artists with three distinctive styles and contributions to the genre seemingly having a blast riffing off each other and delivering some fine music....get it!  'Nuff said...
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Great series plus the blue ray quality made it look that much better. Package arrived 2 days ahead of estimated arrival time. I would suggest this to anyone that loves zombie shows or drama series. Great buy!!!
076535618X|4.0|A sci-fi with intrigue book, its more of a political thriller.  But I mean that in a good way.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Many fans of the original series might feel conflicted about what to think of an Evangelion reboot. I had my own trepidations, too, since I loved the Neon Genesis series so much for what it was: a cerebral twist of the mech genre. Rest assured, the reboot delivers a deliciously visual new breath of life into an old story. Fans and new viewers, alike, will enjoy 1.11 and the volumes to follow. The characters, beloved and hated, appear with more personality and understanding.  The reboot is much more direct in that aspect; in the original, it was hard to sympathize with some of the characters because their personalities (or lack thereof) develop over the length of the series, and some of them never have a chance to redeem themselves or resolve their problems. A little of that issue was taken care of in the final movie, which was good, but felt like a footnote on the end of a 26 episode series--a series which sorely needed a resolution to wrap up the story and give the viewer a feeling of closure.     The new Evangelion is going to be much more straightforward. It explains things as they're happening rather than recounting the whats and whys in later episodes, while still leaving some mystery as to the purpose of some characters and their motives. It's definitely a series to buy because it's worth owning and re-watching. It is not a re-hash of the old series; it is Evangelion re-imagined--Eva in another dimension. Not to mention, the animation is fantastic.
0143038419|1.0|I am so glad that I am not the only person who disliked this book. I didn't even make it through Italy without returning it to the library, thank god it was free! People have recommended this book to me for several years now, and I actually went and saw it in the movies. The movie was not like the book and Gilbert was much more likeable in the movie. When I started reading the book I just felt absolutely terrible. I started to dread reading the book. And why? This was a woman who was successful, had a decent husband (everyone has their problems), and 2 houses to boot. But, waa-waa she wasn't happy. I have dealt with much more intense stuff in my life the past 3 years: teen pregnancy, full-time student, unemployment, food stamps, colon cancer, brain tumors, liver cancer (the latter to my beloved family) etc etc. and I didn't just give up, throw away, my life for something I thought would fulfill me or make me happy again. I do not know Gilbert, but from my readings she is very selfish, self-indulgent, and out right irratating. You can clearly see she is trying to convince herself that what she was doing was right, through her conversations in her head with her husband's voice and her own demons. Like others have noted, if she truly wanted to experience a more fulfilledl life she could have volunteered, or started a charity, or whatever to make the world a better place and to feel outside of herself. Instead, she runs away like a teenager girl going through some adolescent drama. And why it is so famous and recommended? It feeds the rest of Americans who are self-indulgent and living in a throw-away culture. Don't like your job? Quit! Don't like your house? Sell it! Don't like your husband? Divorce! It's no wonder depression is spreading in our country. No one has stability in their lives, or courage to face hard times. It's really sad, and I'm sad that this book is such a hit.
B004IQMXD4|1.0|The first four songs,Stevie uses that baby voice that makes everyone want to vomit.. After Wild heard album her music just got worse, Its time for her to retire.. She cant sing anymore, and her songs are boreing and lifeless..Her live performances are just as embarassing..She has no passion on stage. If you are new to Stevie Nicks, buy Belladonna and Wild heart. The rest is not worth the money..Especially this album.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|It took me a little while to get into this book--the first few chapters weren't as funny as I'd hope. However, by the time I got to her chapter on the working at the YMCA in Chicago, I was laughing out loud and I felt that Tina had found her groove as an author. The book only got better in the parts where she talked about her struggles with \\"balancing it all\\" as a mother. I thought her chapter on the pressure on mothers to breastfeed was spot-on and I loved her self-deprecating humor and witty insights into life sprinkled throughout. The last chapter was a bit of a disappointment if you'd already read it in the New Yorker excerpt. I'm happy for Tina that she decided to go for baby number #2 after all (since she's pregnant right now) and I wish her all the best of luck with juggling the demands of work and motherhood and two kiddos.
B00005QBUK|5.0|I got these to use with a personal sound amplifier.  I can not hear the small songbirds and their high pitched chirps.  The headphones fit lightly in my ear and still allow me to hear around them for normal sounds and I can now hear the Parulas and Warblers chirping in the trees.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|\\"Sim Sala Bim,\\" taken from a Danish children's song, means \\"hocus-pocus\\" or \\"abracadabra\\" or \\"Presto!\\"  It's part of a simple and forgettable line in a song of the same name on Fleet Foxes' latest album (Sim sala bim on your tongue / Carving off the hair of someone's young), but is one of many examples of the small detail imagery and careful unfolding of a delicate story that is told throughout Helplessness Blues.  An album we find powerful and magical.<br /><br />Fleet Foxes continue the harmonic and hypnotic serenade we've come to expect and hope for but, as the album title suggests, Robin Pecknold sings to us in the most reflective tone about the pains and challenge of trying to discover who you are and your station in life.  Demonstrated best in the title track:<br /><br />I was raised up believing / I was somehow unique. / Like a snowflake distinct among snowflakes / Unique in each way you can see. / And now after some thinking / I'd say I'd rather be / A functioning cog in some great machinery / Serving something beyond me.<br /><br />The album is measured and patient as it tells its story.  The buzz of the instruments against the steadiness of the lyrics blurs your periphery and tightens your focus.  Then, in a few sparse moments throughout, Robin breaks his controlled tone to give a glimpse of the power behind his voice.  This album is in no way short of fantastic and will serve nicely as the soundtrack to the start of our Spring and Summer seasons.<br /><br />In the early 1900's, a performer known throughout the world as Dante the Magician would often say \\"Sim sala bim\\" to acknowledge applause from the audience.  A way of saying, \\"Thank you very much\\" to his fans.  2008 was a long time ago, but Fleet Foxes sure know how to thank their fans for the wait.  Sim sala bim.<br /><br />More music reviews at greatbloginthesky [dot] com.
B000PMG16U|1.0|There is way to much wrong with each of the prequels to cover here. The bottom line is that these are terrible movies and do everything wrong and fail to even cover movie making and storytelling 101 concepts. Things that first year students are taught on how to tell a story or make a movie are thrown out with these prequels and I have to wonder why, especially since they were made by someone who is a veteran to movie making. George Lucas was fantastic back in the 70s and 80s so what the hell happened? The most likely reason is that he wanted to molest this franchise for all its worth and get as much money out of it as he possibly could. He didn't care about the quality, he sold out for money and that's just a god damn shame. These could have been fantastic movies if he took the time to write the scripts for them and have people around him willing to tell him that his ideas need work. Judging by the making of for each film, it looks like he surrounded himself with parrots and yes-men, absolutely no one willing to tell him that his ideas are terrible and why even though they all knew that George Lucas was making really bad movies.     If you want a really in-depth and accurate look at the Star Wars prequels and where they went wrong, look up RedLetterMedia, it covers my feelings on this movies perfectly.
B00328R21C|5.0|This is one of the best lego sets I have ever received,<br />on my opinion this was worth the price because I saw this at walmart once and never saw it again and I cant find this anywere. So I was so desperate I got here on amazon. It arrived faster than expected. It was in new condition.<br />I really enjoyed this set so over all<br /><br />5/5
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Ok you people are crazy this book was AMAZING!!  I loved,loved,loved it!!!  It was hot and sexy and really just awesome.  I could definitely read it all over again!!!
076115678X|3.0|I would like this book a lot more if it weren't so full of puns.  And I can't agree that I've ever been discriminated against for having gorgeous long red curls.  But as for hair care, she has some good ideas.  I've been using the One Conditioner and I do think my hair looks better.  It's hard to know if the better hair is from the product, from the techniques, or just from me paying more attention to my hair.    If you're a walking frizz bomb, read it.
0345522478|5.0|I don't usually read fantasy novels, but I'm glad I made an exception here; I loved the story. A Druid lives in Arizona, pretending to be twenty one years old, while he is actually twenty-one centuries old. He is threatened by witches and assisted by werewolves, all of whom also appear, on the surface, as normal people. He meets otherworldly creatures who help him in his fight against the evil Celtic god.<br /><br />I always want more than just a good story, however. The Druid's connection to the earth and use of energy provide that. The Druid draws his energy from the earth, a reminder of our separation from nature in this technological world. We see the importance of understanding the use of energy in his actions and how we have lost the connection to our environment and our bodies. The author is subtly teaching us. I like that.<br /><br />The violence, which is so prevalent in many stories, and in our world, is more acceptable here as it is directed only to defend good, an important distinction. I like the Druid. He is a good guy and the reader begins to care about him, laughing at his sense of humor and appreciating his humility. Despite his abilities of shape-shifting and attracting enormous energy from the earth, he is never arrogant or self-assured, a refreshing respite from many characters, both fictional and real.<br /><br />I look forward to getting drawn back into this Druid's exciting, crazy, moral and funny world in his next two books in the series.
0425241505|5.0|The hardest reviews for me to write are often the books that I am absolutely crazy about.  Dragon Bound would be one of said books.  You would think it would be easier since I am so psyched, but I think the excitement just takes over and instead of words coming out of my mouth it is more like giddy squeals.  Sad I know, but true.  I am going to try and tone it down so I articulate the awesomeness of this book to you now.    Dragon Bound is the first book in what looks to be an extremely addictive adult paranormal romance series.  Thea Harrison introduces you to a world where paranormal creatures are not just prevalent they are also widely known about by humans and live among them.  Almost any paranormal creature you can think of is present in this book.  There are vampires, and fae and dragons, oh my!  For the purposes of this book though, we mostly focus in on the wyr, which are a form of shape shifters.  In essence each wyr has an animal, that can be either real or mythological, they can shift into or take human form to blend more easily into society.    Our leading male, Dragos, is a wyr whose base form is a dragon and his human form is hot!  I mean, an extremely wealthy businessman known for his ruthless and unforgiving personality.  He is also the most dominant alpha male I have read about in a long time.  Words like \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" do not exist in his vocabulary.  He does not ask you a question, he tells you your opinion and then just gives you an order.    Enter, Pia, our leading lady.  We know that she is a half wyr, half human, but her animal form is unknown.  You will eventually figure it out, but I will not be revealing that information here.  It is much more fun to try and riddle it out as you progress through the book and hints are dropped.  Pia has grown up living almost a half life since her mother past away.  She internalizes her problems and is very private.  She longs to find love and fill that hole her mothers death has left.  In an attempt to trust again, she let a couple of secrets about her identity slip to her now ex-boyfriend who uses the information to blackmail her. She is trying to learn from her mistakes and as a result she has put up a wall around her heart.  Pia definitely is not a girl who likes to take orders and watching her stand up to Dragos stubbornness is extremely entertaining.    The two get thrown together when Pia steals something from Dragos, who in turn hunts her down to take revenge.  Of course when he finds her, she intrigues him so much he deciedes to keep her around for a while instead of torturing her.  He does not have long to try and break down her walls though, because they are soon in a serious car crash, captured by goblins, beaten and left for dead to rot in prison.  And that is only the first part of their little adventure!    Dragos and Pia chemistry sparks immediately and it continues to burn throughout the length of the book.  While trying to escape immanent death, Pia attempts to teach Dragos some manners and introduce him to polite conversation, which is beyond amusing.  While he does not get the hang of it right away, the behavior does start to take hold and watching the progression of Dragos character throughout the book was fascinating.    Overall this book is just amazing.  I am going to go ahead and say it is the best book I have read this year.  I know that is a bold statement, but that is exactly how I feel about it.  I started the book when I got home from work one night and stayed up until one a.m. to finish.  I could not put the book down for a second!  I actually made myself slow down towards the end of reading it so I could draw out the experience.  The best part?   This is just book one, we still have more to come in the future!  The next book comes out in August and is titled Storm's Heart.  I am really excited about it because if focuses on Tricks.  She had me cracking up in Dragon Bound, so a whole book about her is going to be a real treat.If you have not discovered this series, you need to.  It is a captivating story that will grab a hold of you and demand your full, undivided attention.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|This album is exactly what the world has been missing for years. Stevie has returned in top form, creating the most cohesive album since 1981's Bella Donna. In Your Dreams is an eclectic array of genres from folk, to rock, to country, to blues, and even European techno, all intertwined and dowsed with the classic bewitching ethereal sound and art that is Stevie Nicks. She lures you in with Secret Love, breaks your heart with For What It's Worth, picks up the pieces with In Your Dreams and takes you on an enchanting adventure through Wide Sargasso Sea, New Orleans, Moonlight, and Annabel Lee. She tugs at your heartstrings again with the heartbreaking memoir of her trips to Walter Reed with Soldier's Angel. Everybody Loves You and Ghosts Are Gone take you to the edge and allow you to experience Stevie in a new way that feels strangely familiar. After a bluesy trip into a love affair come and gone in You May Be The One and a picturesque rendezvous in Italian Summer, her and Dave Stewart send you out with the heartfelt country-tinged Cheaper Than Free. This album is simply amazing on every aspect and may be the best $10 you have spent in years!
0812550706|5.0|This book has been rated of the Top 100 Best Books for Teens by the ALA.  I don't agree.  It should be moved up on the list.  It should be required reading for every politician and educator out there.<br /><br />It absolutely scared me to death.  In these days of war and technology and educational upheavel and video games, the scenes and characters seemed much to real.  I plunged into it expecting to hate it and hate it I did but for all the wrong reasons.  It is eerie how close the author gets to the very truth of human existence, of humanity.  Ender pulled at my heart the whole way through even while I felt this huge gulf developing between us.  In the end, I was afraid to look away, afraid of what would happen IF I didn't keep reading.<br /><br />One of the most amazing books I have read in a long time.  I can't wait to recommend it to my classes!
0439023521|4.0|Over a century from now, North America is a land ravaged by floods and war. Out of the ashes a new nation, Panem, has emerged, consisting of the glorious city known as the Capitol and twelve outlying districts which only exist to provide the Capitol with resources (a thirteenth district was destroyed in a rebellion three-quarters of a century ago). To keep the people in line, the government enforces the Hunger Games, a reality TV show where twenty-four teenage boys and girls must fight one another for survival in a game of wits and strength.<br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take the place of her sister when she is selected for the Games. Transported to a hostile wilderness, Katniss must use every bit of her cunning and her training as a hunter to prevail.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is the first book in the trilogy of the same name. First published in 2008, it has become a hugely successful novel, spawning two sequels and a forthcoming movie adaptation, and has won plaudits from both younger readers and adults alike (Stephen King is a noted fan).<br /><br />The premise is unoriginal but Collins nevertheless executes it reasonably well. This is a brisk read where Collins develops the plot and delivers action beats with skill, but not at the expense of characterisation (though, with only two characters of note to develop, this isn't as challenging as it could be). Katniss is an intriguing but more interesting is the way that Collins establishes the motivation and character of Peeta, Katniss's sometimes-ally in the games, since we only see him through Katniss's eyes. Characters outside these two are less well-developed, however.<br /><br />Collins also holds back on exploring the full savagery of the games, perhaps understandably given the target audience. Still, there is the feeling that we more hear about how horrible the games are rather than seeing them in full flow (one tense moment involving mutated dogs aside). In addition, we know very little about the other contestants. A couple get some nice moments in the sun so we feel bad when they die, but generally the focus of the game itself is the mental battle of wills and PR that Katniss and Peeta are playing with the people running the game. This is surprising and considerably more difficult than just showing the contestants offing one another, since this struggle can only by necessity be depicted through one side, since we only have Katniss's POV, so we, like her, can only guess what the people in the Capitol are up to. To Collins' credit she pulls it off, and works in a couple of interesting themes about reality TV, bloodsports, PR and marketing into the bargain.<br /><br />The book does have a potential problem in that it does come off very much like a Battle Royale-lite. Whilst that's not a problem if you've never read or seen Battle Royale, if you have then the weaknesses of The Hunger Games become slightly more apparent. Most notably, whilst Collins' Games are cruel, they don't match the shocking harshness that Royale achieves by simply having all the contestants be in the same school year, meaning they've known one another for years before having to kill one another. In that sense, Koushan Takami scores higher with some of the things he wants to say about youth and teenager-hood being a Darwinian struggle for survival. At the same time, the two works, whilst stemming from the same basic idea, are aimed in rather different directions and Takami benefits from a much greater word-count and a more adult audience to work with, so comparisons between the two are fair only up to a point.<br /><br />Moving on from that, The Hunger Games (****) is a fast-paced, enjoyable read with some interesting (if hardly revelatory) things to say about celebrity and PR, not to mention a counter-intuitive approach to the inevitable romance story, but suffers a little from the well-mined premise and patchy characterisation. The novel is available now in the UK and USA.
1439102724|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that if you are anti-gay, you will probably hate this novel.  If you are an open-minded human, though, you will probably enjoy it.<br /><br />I'm not going to re-hash the novel, since all the spoilers really and truly SPOIL the book for those who are reading these reviews and haven't read the book yet.<br /><br />Just a few words:<br /><br />The good stuff - a very timely topic, very controversial and very emotional.  Picoult's writing is excellent.  After finishing the book, I told my husband, \\"This would be a great movie!\\"  For Picoult to include real-life groups such as that horrid Westboro Baptist Church group made the novel all the more real.  We used to live in Topeka, KS and got to see that group \\"in action\\" and let me tell you, it was as BAD as Picoult shows in the novel.  I realize that not every religious group that's anti-gay is THAT out of line, but trust me, if this was a true-life story, I'm sure that Phelps and his crew would be there in court causing trouble.  So, kudos to Picoult for making the novel REAL.<br /><br />The not so good stuff - had to wonder about Zoe and her love for Vanessa versus her love for her ex.  During the nine years she was married to Max, did she have a clue that she was a lesbian?  I mean, I believe in Love at First Sight, but it seemed to happen pretty quickly.  Next, what happened to Lucy?  I really cared for her!  and they left me hanging...was she in love with Zoe? another girl?<br /><br />So, yes, I loved the book.  I was hanging on by a thread towards the end, not knowing what was going to happen, wanting to read FASTER so that I could get to the ending, but once I got there, didn't want it to stop.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This anniversary edition has exquisite voices, even some stagecrafting.  The finale with original cast members takes one's breath away. The only criticism is that the overall video is rather dark, perhaps from the lighting.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Easy to find options in interface.  Cleaver feed update functionality. It would be nice to have a 'jump to top' shortcut.
140120841X|5.0|First of all I have to say that the movie is totally different from the comic. I'm not saying it's bad, just different.<br /><br />The comic itself is fantastic...even though I'm not a fan of Dave Lloyd's art, Moore's script is simply dazzling.<br /><br />What the hell, forget the freaking movie and read this.
B004VD3PE0|4.0|This book gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes!  How could a story about a girl clinging to the edge of life in a coma and having to decide whether to wake up and face life without her family or die and find peace not be? It's extremely thought-provoking and powerful.  I was constantly wondering what I would do in that situation, and it was really interesting to see this author's take on what happens to people when they are in a coma.  I liked how the story started very quickly and then revealed background information through flashbacks.  But often I found myself wanting to skip over the flashback because I wanted to know what was happening with Mia!  My only complain is that the flashbacks were almost boring compared to the present action, but they are necessary to understand the character and what choice she will make.  I read this book in one sitting and experienced many emotions as I read it, and I think all readers will have a similar experience with this book.
0765326353|4.0|A very slow start, much slower than other fantasy books that are world building, but Sanderson doesn't rely on any of the preformed fantasy archetypes.  He truly makes his own world and after 400 or so pages it starts to suck you in.  After 500 you have trouble putting it down.  Enjoy this and wait patiently for book 2.
1400052181|5.0|This was one of the most interesting books that I have read this year.  I consider myself to be well educated and feel cheated that I knew nothing of HELA until the PAIGE TURNERS chose it as the book club's choice.  WOW!  It was an astonishing revelation regarding the work on cancer research that has been going on since 1951, compliments of Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells.  When I feel cheated, I think of her family who did not learn of her identity for 40 years.  By the way, I feel she had a right to be identified earlier but do not feel monetary compensation should be made for her research.  However, the fact that her family members cannot afford, and do not receive good medical treatment ,is a disgrace to the medical field.
B003R4ZMNQ|4.0|Jack Lord was a better actor than O'Laughlin is, but the other three current characters are way better, more developed and engaging.  I especially like Scott Caan as Danno, he is the bomb!  The cinematography and background scenes are the best in TV, almost movie like.    The biggest knock I have is against the producers, why do they dress McGarret in an unbuttoned shirt?  It's very unprofessional for a law enforcement officer, it takes away from his supposed authority figure.  Maybe they can fix that for season 2.
B004G6009K|5.0|This movie was spectacular, I watched it on a HDTV on Blue Ray and I loved it.  A week later we got a new LG passive 3D TV and we bought this movie since we needed something 3D to watch on it!  Since we had just seen the movie I kinda didn't want to watch it right away but my wife insisted and it was even more amazing then the first time we watched it! Other then the story being great, and the animation being flawless, the 3D blew me away! This movie is proof that 3D is more then a gimmick and I am completely sold!
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Great sound track. I am enjoying listening to it. I am also oldschool in that I like to purchase CD's.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|At least as a bonus disc. Why not take a queue from Blade Runner and give the VIEWER the option to choose which he likes best?!
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I like this CD. Mostly the first track, but the others are warming up to me. A little too country for me. But I really like track one.
B003UYUP58|5.0|For a non-medical person, this book was easy to read and understand.  At first I wondered if the subject matter would be too scientific to be interesting to a lay person, but the style in which it's written, the stories it tells, and the tone of the book are fascinating.  The author is curious, smart and funny.  He is also empathetic and caring.  I imagine his patients are fortunate to have him as their doctor.      The book is long and the subject matter isn't a happy one. But it doesn't drag and is very readable.   I brought it on vacation and literally could not put it down.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Just wanted to get mt 5 star rating in on this book, awesome read! I am not into fantasy, but this was amazing! Look forward to book 2!
B004H8GLXQ|3.0|I'm not too fond of reading haha, (I like my Japanese manga) but something about this book dragged me in.  While it wasn't overly spectacular and even though the twist was interesting, I did expect more of a shock to come from it.  It was an easy read, however certain times it did get confusing but as long as you keep track of the characters you'll be fine.  Overall it's not a bad read and I found it rather enjoyable especially since I finished rather quickly! I also found myself wanting to read more and asking myself well what's gonna happen next?! But most of all this is coming from someone who finds it impossible to get into so many books, so it should carry more weight! I do recommend this book!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I cannot reccommend this book enough!! Fans of Tina Fey's humor and work would really enjoy and love this book. I also enjoyed that it wasn't a typical autobiography, more of little vignettes of her life. Her voice and humor definitely come across! One of the gems in this book definitely has to be the prayer for her daughter, classic and awesome. Plus, some really enjoyable footnotes! If you enjoy stories where someone learns by great embarrasment and lands on top this is a book for you. Awesome read, highly reccommended!!! I would also suggest checking out the Audiobook as she reads it herself and I think her intonations would make it all the better!!
B004N44SOI|5.0|\\"This Is Gonna Hurt\\" is great! This is a great follow-up album from Sixx A.M. All the tracks on here are great.    1. This Is Gonna Hurt  2. Lies Of The Beautiful People  3. Are You With Me  4. Live Forever  5. Sure Feels Right  6. Deadlihood  7. Smile  8. Help Is On The Way  9. Oh My God  10. Goodbye My Friends  11. Skin
1423113381|4.0|I just finished reading The Red Pyramid.  I've read the Percy Jackson books and the The Lost Hero previously and enjoyed them as well.    Rick Riordan seems to be establishing a formula for himself in the YA-\\"gods from mythology are real\\" genre.  I am enjoying his formula.  The books are page-turners, and I love to imagine these rollicking adventures with ancient deities.      The Kane chronicles do have a different \\"flavor\\" from the Greek and Roman encounters from Camp Half-Blood.  Magic works differently for the Egyptian-spun segment of Riordan-World, and I appreciate that mortals can be deadly threats to gods.    As I was growing up, one of my favorite guilty-pleasure authors was Piers Anthony.  I would readily rank Rick Riordan up there with Piers Anthony for fun formulaic prolific YA fantasy.  These novels do not transcend their genre, like Harry Potter did, but they are good, well-written adventures.    (Anything that gets kids to love ancient mythology is okay by me.)
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Very impressed with this album. I think I finally \\"get\\" the Foo's after this album and the last one, and they are now one of my favorite bands. I would go out on a limb and say that this is probably their best album to date. Dave is a true musician and song writer. Not many bands out there doing what these guys are doing anymore (with the same quality). Buy it!
B004MKM8L8|3.0|The movie is great, however the video quality is easily the worst out of all the blu-rays that I have purchased.    It is grainy and the colors don't seem accurate.  Be nice if they would have released a well mastered version, but my guess is that they are holding out for a big release box set before we can get a good version.  shame.
0571238343|5.0|This covers everything an animator needs to know, covering all the basics whilst also covering the more complex principles. Williams writing style is fun and informative, and is an enjoyable read.<br />Williams talks about all the animation principles, working in the industry, improving your art, acting for animation, directing, dealing with producers and more.<br />Whether you are just starting out or need to brush up, this is definitely a book all animators (and I would even say artists and illustrators) should have.
B004R92PYE|2.0|I miss the techno dance feel of PATD, but its gone and dead.<br /><br />I guess I`ll never get the patd feel i fell for back when they are first on tour.<br /><br />another good band had lost its way.
0786860707|4.0|I bought this book second hand from this seller and I am very happy with my purchase. Book was in condition as described and arrived on time. Would defiantly recommend this seller :)
B004I2K4DY|4.0|We have seen productions of Les Misearbles three times, including once in London. Before purchasing the 25th anniversary concert, we had watched it on PBS and I read the reviews on Amazon. The only negative comment I can make is casting Nick Jonas as Marius. His voice, although pleasant, just didn't belong on the same stage with the rest of the performers. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean was outstanding. The highlight of the DVD was having original cast members come on at the end for a great finale. We are very happy with the DVD.
0061726826|4.0|This was different to say the least.  A world where love is a disease...I really liked this book it wasn't what I expected, but I liked it.  I didn't really like Lena at first but through out the book she grew on me.  There were are few things in this that really struck me, there was a scene where a child fell and was crying but no one came to care for the child or even check on them, how in a world without love do these people care for there children?  Being a mother I look at this and it is rather terrifying...a world where I could no love my daughter, or hug her or be anything but almost completely indifferent towards her...that is scary.  But Lena knew love from her mother and found love with a special boy and she refused to let love go.  She has lived her life learning that this disease will kill her but she is okay with that, because in a world with no love, love might just be the best thing you can find.  I really can't wait for the next book.  I want to find out what happens to Lena, Alex, Hana, and Grace.  I give this 4.5 stars!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Where is it? Been waiting, waiting... Would like to know when in may is the may update coming. Hope it comes this may, since right now, its may.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Didn't really want to rate the game--since I've never played it--but I felt my input might be valuable: Game grinds to a Force Close at every run attempt on Optimus V... and I paid for it! Hopefully Amazon will give me my dollar back!
B004Q1FDHO|2.0|this app was fun for the first few minutes, but got boring quickly. not to mention it took up HUGE space! i played for about 10minutes, trying to give it a chance...but was failed. not to mention it kept freezing up so you had to sit and wait for it to catch up with itself...or shut off your phone&amp;restart again. uninstalled the same day. great idea however...just needs lots of work.
0143036424|5.0|I had previously borrowed this book from a friend, and as soon as I was done, I went to Amazon.com and bought all the rest of the series.  Craig Johnson has created the epitome of Wyoming with Sheriff Walt Longmire and his his sidekicks.  His sense of humor is so perfect...I've laughed out loud many times! His mysteries are powerful stories, though.  I've communicated personally with the author many times since, and I know that A&E has signed on to produce a series based on these books.  It is filming right now, in fact, and fans are all eagerly awaiting the first episode.  I decided I want to read the first book again, so I purchased it from Amazon to add to my now complete collection!  Craig Johnson is on the top of my favorite authors list! Oh, and I grew up in Wyoming.
B004IQMXD4|2.0|I'll be the dissident here and say that I was underwhelmed and disappointed.  This is no Trouble in Shangri La and more's the pity.  The writing is pretty and the arrangements are pretty and the whole album is pretty forgettable and dare I say, trite.  Stevie never truly stretches that distinctively magnificent voice of hers.  Most of the songs are too wordy; like she is reciting her poetry to music and did not write them and arrange them as true songs.  Cheryl Crow did a much better job as a producer of Stevie's work.  Then again, I think the quality of the songs on Trouble in Shangri La was much, much better than what is offered here.  The first four songs on that album kick ass and the rest aren't bad.  While some of the songs on In Your Dreams are evocative, I didn't find anything that made me want to listen to it over and over again.  In fact, they kinda made my teeth hurt.  No doubt Twilight fans will be swooning over this effort.
0007268149|5.0|Please note that all reviews prior to February 2010 concern the first edition. However, much of what has been said for that first edition holds for the new one as well. And if you live in North America, it makes more sense (economically), to get the Princeton version: Birds of Europe: (Second Edition) (Princeton Field Guides). That edition is not only cheaper, it also has a more suitable name. Its contents is exactly the same, despite the different name.    At any rate, the long awaited second edition of this excellent field guide is finally here. Improving on the world's best bird field guide is almost certainly a task that will disappoint a few. However, the authors and illustrators are to be commended for their achievement. Despite an addition of almost fifty pages, compared to the first edition, this is still a very field-worthy book. The text, range maps, and many illustrations have been throughly revised and updated. Particularly noteworthy are the many new owl illustrations, and the page of \\"Atlantic\\" pigeons. Many \\"new\\" species have been added due to splits from previous subspecies. Thus, many island races from the Canary Islands are now full species. Some taxonomic groups got a particular revision, such as the wheatears and the \\"Herring Gull complex\\". The treatment of the latter has been expanded from less than a double page to three full spreads. With Caspian Gull being fully illustrated in various plumages, for example. The taxonomic sequence got some changes in the first parts of the book, with geese and ducks now at the front. The same confusing fashion as in field guides of North America and many other areas of the world. There is actually no need for a field guide to follow the latest taxonomic insights. Rather, there needs to be a sequence that allows for quickly finding a group of birds. And that would be best served if the basic sequence were kept constant.     Unfortunately, non-native species got a rather worse coverage than in the first edition.Some were relegated to the back of the book such as the locally well established Wood Duck and Mandarin Duck. And even for the European native Ruddy Shelduck, the range presumably due to human releases is not shown on the map. Personally, I consider such omissions a lack of recognizing reality. The same problems, unfortunately, are found in such leading works as the Handbook of the Birds of the World, and likewise for the mammal equivalent.     A welcome change in the range maps is the use of more detailed regional maps for very localised species. Despite the time span of about ten years since the first edition, and the repeated postponement in the publication of this edition for about two years, it seems that there must have been a certain rush at the end. Thus, there are relatively many typos or other minor oversights. No big thing, but somewhat of a bother nevertheless. Hopefully, a large part will be corrected in subsequent printings.     Despite the various points I have criticized here, the book fully merits its five stars. It is just SO good! However, if you already own the first edition, and you use it mainly for local birding, you might want to just keep that edition.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|A review to bring attention to the fact that it appears Lucas does not care about what the fans want.
B00018D44U|5.0|Love her music, love this C.D. If you like Norah Jones you will be pleased. She has a soft, gentle voice and plays simple pleasant music. Easy listening.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|A review to bring attention to the fact that it appears Lucas does not care about what the fans want.  Just say no to the Special Ed. Edition.
B003OF3R0S|2.0|Simply and shortly put, this album does not raise the atmosphere from the melodic wonders A7X is known from. Nightmare sure is decent song, but repeating use of swear word f*** pissed me off after a while, making it feel really, really unnecessary. Other songs are... well, forgettable. Song Victim is the best song from the album as it's beautiful and in it Shadows uses his voice beautifully and along the song! In other songs it feels like he do have something to say but no matter in which tune. Like said, it's forgettable. All melodic changes come all of a sudden before I can get attached to the previous one.  I can only imagine a A7X fan to get excited from this album as it still offers typical melodic and catchy guitar riffs along with drums from A7X. There might be also something new but it's not mind-blowing. Not at all! This album is only for fans: Only they can get into these songs as they hear their favorite artist playing.  Sadly this was a huge let-down for me. What's though good news is that new unreleased track Not Ready To Die seems to have combined all the good A7X has ever had! So buy that one from iTunes and hope for the course to change to better as the new album is quite sure to come! U wonder if I'm asking more mainstream-friendly songs? Lets just put it like this: I wish them to make actually good songs.

0765322889|1.0|`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br />All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />  And the mome raths outgrabe.<br /><br />Does that paragraph sound confusing?  It's the Jabberwocky poem from Lewis Carrol.  I reference it because Gardens of the Moon is like a long version of that poem.  Characters, races, types of magic, scandals and so on are written without any context or any prior information to illuminate the reader as to who some of these people are, or what different words that are thrown around actually mean.  Important moments come off as dull because there is no frame of reference for it.  I had to keep checking that I was reading the first book in the series, as it feels like coming into a movie in the middle and try to sort out what the hell is going on.  The dialog doesn't feel natural, the character development is all over the place, and the plot twists usually involve throwing in a character or ability that was not yet introduced and comes off a tacky deus ex machina.<br /><br />I heard good things and I wanted to love it, but the way it was written kept me from enjoying the story.  Every time I'd get into it a character, race, plot point, or otherwise would spring up without introduction or explanation as though the reader is meant to psychically understand what the author was going for.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I wanted to see the sunset and asked what time the sun set. Somehow it mathematically told me the exact time! Htc evo
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I had seen the movie when it first came out in 1986 and I bought 'Crossroads' for the guitar solo at the end - magic!  However, the story is plausible - meeting the devil at the Crossroads and selling your soul for a chance at fame - didn't Faust do that???    The characters are believable, even Ralph Macchio, surprisingly.  I don't know if he was the one playing the guitar, but whoever was was very good.     Heartily recommend the DVD to anyone of any age.  Don't think you will be disappointed.
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|It's an excellent product,very fun.  My kid has 10 and he can carry the toy very easy, load and shoot is easy too.
B001W6S0C6|5.0|All I can say is GREAT MOVIE and it's even better on Blu-ray. I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid back in '89 and now I'm sitting back and enjoying it with my kids. Like I said GREAT MOVIE and the book was pretty cool my son had fun with it...the only problem I can really see with this item is that the digital copy is no good due to the fact that it's expired.
0756404738|5.0|I've read quite a bit of fiction and fantasy in my life, but Patrick Rothfuss' writing stands out as the most unique among them.  Sure there are the usual fantasy settings and tropes, we like to think everything has to be original but the truth of the matter all new works are influenced by previous works, it's how you take that influence and mold into your own that makes what you have truly unique.    Patrick has taken a fallen world and shelled it out, than through the story fills it in with believeable characters, settings and methods of magic.  His treatment of female characters is outstanding for a writer, most writers have no clue how to treat them.  The system of magic used in this world is explained in detail enough you could apply for a patent for it.    His characters aren't perfect, in fact they are very flawwed and that is what makes them believeable.  The protagonist makes mistakes that are actually believeable and you can see the inner workings of the character and proclaim \\"I can see him doing that, it's within his nature described thus far\\".    Overall a stunning masterpiece, truly the Tolkien of our time.
0312600844|5.0|I picked up this book after seeing it everywhere for a few months, and I really liked it.  I was surprised afterwards to discover just how mixed of a reception it was getting here on Amazon.  It's a great book about the lives of a man, his wife, their friends and family and bounces around a bit to varioius times in their life - which isn't exactly my cup of tea - but was handled masterfully.  Great read, highly recommended.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|CD Plays perfectly. packaging was perfect. delivery was prompt.  But on the back of the CD is a sticker stating:    FOR PROMOTION ONLY  OWNERSHIP RESERVED BY SONY  SALE IS UNLAWFUL  ORAW 34 S1    gosh i hope i dont have Sony green berets bashing down my door to get this back!!!!
B000683VI4|5.0|The Notebook is based on a book with the same name by Nicolas Sparks.  Its a very sweet love story that brought tears to my eyes.  The movie opens with a man (played by James Garner) reading a story to a women (played by Gena Rowlands) in a nursing home.  The story is of young love.  Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams play the young couple, Noah and Allie.<br /><br />At one point in the film, Allie has to choose between her love for Noah and love for her fiance Lon.  She says, \\"When I'm with Noah I feel like one person and when I'm with you I feel like someone totally different.\\"  I thought that was such a great sentiment highlighting the challenges in choosing love.  The scene really illustrates how hard it can be when your heart is torn between two loves.<br /><br />As the film continues, the viewer realizes that the man and woman in the nursing home is actually the young couple in the story.  The older Allie now has advanced Alzheimer's disease.  She rarely remembers her family and Noah reads her their story to remind her of their lovely life together.  This is a beautiful story that is guaranteed to bring a tear or two to your eyes.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|My review will be short and sweet since a lot of the previous reviewers have already given the gist of the story. I would give this movie 10 stars if I could -- the story is superb, the acting is wonderful and oh my, Armitage is such a hunk! I fell in love with the characters and there was no boring moment. There was even one very tender scene near the end that I had to go back to over and over (at the train stop when finally his love was reciprocated by a sweet kiss on his hand)... it makes you remember that love is such a beautiful thing. I never thought there could be another movie I could love as much as Pride and Prejudice, but this one is definitely in that level. If you love Jane Austen's stories, this comes highly recommended! Of course, the ending is a HAPPY one. :)
B000000OF6|5.0|This is a very basic but superbly complied Greatest Hits. Ideally, you should get individual albums, if you are a big fan. But this does a very nice job of a. Giving you the best from Queen (their most \\"famous\\" songs in a nutshell).  b. Saving some cash if you are a little poorer this month than last.    So there you have it. Get it, enjoy it. And - Rock On! =)
B000005J56|4.0|I learned of this cd from a Spanish language course and followed up on it.  I enjoy the music very much, as well as the fact that the CD is accompanied by a pamphlet containing the words to the songs.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This was not an easy read.....emotionally.  But it is a book once read....never forgotten.  From start to finish this book held my rapt attention.  I kept hoping for the best and fearing the worst.......couldn't put it down.
030746363X|4.0|Good idea.  Hard to follow because it is boring to eat the same thing.  It does work but not a long term option.
1400032717|3.0|This book took me through some highs and lows. From the perspective of an autistic boy, this book was interesting but at times difficult to read. I frequently found myself feeling sorry and concerned for Christopher, which left me anxious as I turned the pages. However, I found I finished this book with an understanding that Christopher does not understand human emotions. This story is very unusual and not meant to relate to the reader. This is not a book I would read again and I would only recommend this book to certain readers.
B0021L8V0M|2.0|Action movie and you know that action will be in the next scene.  By the end you do not care,
0425241505|5.0|I read a lot of paranormal romance and am always on the lookout for a new series. I was hooked from the first page: compelling characters, lots of action, thrilling romance, and an intricate, fascinating world. I literally could not put this book down and was sad to see it end!  If you like books by Christine Feehan or Sherrilyn Kenyon, you will love Dragon Bound. I eagerly anticipate the next book in the series.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|very funny, a quick read. she didn't spend as much space on SNL as she did the other aspects of her life, but still well worth picking up.
B004HW7JMO|1.0|I thought this was awful. So over the top it wasn't funny. It's just a vehicle for gore and sex. When it came to a lesbian kiss with lucy lawless I had to stop. I thought this is obviously for the XBox game playing kids that don't want any reality in drama. Just gore and sex. John Hannah swearing so much it's like he's paid a thousand dollars per profanity. I can enjoy the occasional bit of porn but I don't like seeing it in tv dramas, it cheapens the whole thing. You also have the occasional bit where a gladiator stands and does nothing while the hero performs a somersault or something before killing the motionless gladiator - like those old kung fu movies.Drivel.
0394721772|5.0|I was amazed by the first volume, and this one is as good, and it adds all the recepies missing in the first one (vegetables, for instance). Also, the recepies are adapted to food processor. If you want to learn how to cook french cuisine, go for both volumes. But if you are not specially interested in french and you only want to know how to cook well, go for these books too. You will learn how to cook anything. These books are probably not possible to produce today, because it takes a team of smart ladies with deep knowledge about cooking, plenty of time and a true selfishless scientist spirit.     I am working on my PhD and these books are as good as an excellent dissertation.
B00356CO1E|4.0|I finally decided to face my fears and get the 30 Day Shred by Jillian. I haven't been working out as often as I should, I bought this Dvd to help jump start the process of getting back into the game. I must say you do work your butt off, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. There is a lot of jumping, but I'm getting better and can do most of the exercises with little or any modification. My next step is to get Level 2 to help mix things up.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I've been a very dedicated fan of Stevie's music, both with and without Fleetwood Mac for many years now.  I had always thought \\"Bella Donna\\" would forever remain my absolute favorite...until \\"In Your Dreams\\".  This record in my opinion is THE stand out album of her entire career! There are no \\"filler\\" songs here, just an awesome variety of country, rock, heartfelt ballads...something to suit all tastes.  In the past, I had believed that Jimmy Iovine was the only producer I would agree with involving Stevie's music. I'm glad Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard have proven me wrong!  I'll be very surprised if this record doesn't become a Grammy nominee, it just has that aura about it.  Please Stevie, collaborate with these guys again very soon, so that we all can be as excited about future prospects as we are most definitely about this one! Don't let another long 10 years go by.  Thank you again so much!
B000VZJNYS|4.0|Not on anyones list of top albums of 80's metal, but KISS was not really an 80's metal band.  This album is just Great, Heavy, Rock & Roll.  In my opinion after several tries to get back in the spotlight KISS finally found a great \\" Post Make-up \\" sound that did not copy the music of the era, but still fit right in.  I'm am not a huge KISS follower, but this Album was part of those memorable teen years and has some great music.
0553805371|3.0|I have read all books by both authors and I do find that Mlodinow's story-telling capabilities help the more pedantic Hawking. That having been said though, a book titled \\"The Grand Design\\" shoud do more than say: ...well this might be it...with a little more work...\\". So, maybe I expected too much but they DID tease me.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Broadway tickets are 100 bucks a throw; and that's a one night engagement. you will have this dvd for ever. the only full version of this musical ever realeased. although slightly diffrent from the original, still a priceless movie.     can't say enough about this movie.    p.s.  i wish i had bought the blue-ray version of this movie only to increase the quality.
0061537969|1.0|Terrible book. Can't believe it had 4.5 stars!     The only reason I think people would like this book is if they really like NASCAR and dogs.    The beginning was slow, kept reading in hopes of a better middle. The middle was intriguing but the ending was so terrible, I can't believe this book was even published!
B004KPLVW2|5.0|This classic looks great on BluRay.  My kids age 10 and 8 have really got into Tron since viewing Tron Legacy in the theater.  This is a great way for them to see the beginning of the story.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Need I say more?    I love the scene in the beginning when Gru gives the little boy the balloon.    This movie should also be a warning to mothers to be more loving and less detached.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Technology is great.  Remember the watching a movie back in the 80's. The detail, effects and clarity sucked.  This movie with the new technology and cgi + a HD plasma tv + Blu Ray player = awesome movie experience.
B002GYVRRI|4.0|I really love this CD/DVD.<br />Red has a much more rock sound that I enjoy immensely.<br />Fripp really lets it rock on the opening track and it does not stop from there.<br />The bonus tracks are also brilliant. I also enjoyed the bonus DVD section containing several great videos, Bill Bruford really shines on these videos.<br /><br />This is a great set and has been well produced, value for money is what this is all about.

0446693804|5.0|I've seen both the movie and the book and fell in love with the book. I must admit, I have not been a fan of Nicholas Sparks. For some reason, I cannot get into his books but this one pulled me right in. I finished the book in one sitting, no lie. It's a good read. Yes, predictable and because I've seen the movie, I had a gist of what was to happen. But let me tell you this, the book is so much better than the movie. I am so happy that I actually read it. If you are doubting this book, just read it. As I said before, I'm not a fan of Nicholas Sparks but this book was one of the bests I've read. No regrets!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|... Just as many other \\"Theatrical\\" vs \\"Director's Cut's\\" are offered from studios like Fox.    BUT, Lucas doesn't want you to have them. -- Interesting that someone who fought against colorization of black & white classics (as cinema revisionism) seems unable to recognize his own revisionism, to one of the most significant collection of (sci-fi) movies ever created in the annuls of film.    I'm glad to see so many others upset about this very issue.. but Lucas started a trend with other filmmakers (on DVD), which is a tragedy - to not see corrected in the era of Blu-Ray.    I'm thankful that Blu-Ray has delivered to me, the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL versions of films like: Blade Runner / Close Encounters / Star Trek: TMP / Eyes Wide Shut / ...and I understand that the new Superman Box-set coming out is FINALLY going to have the ORIGINAL \\"Superman: The Movie\\" cut.    HOWEVER... Up till now, I've still been DENIED on Blu-Ray the ORIGINAL versions of: Michael Mann's \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" / Milos Foreman's \\"Amadeus\\" / Russell Mulcahy's \\"Highlander\\" / Steven Spielberg's \\"1941\\" / Barry Levinson's \\"The Natural\\" / and I hear John Milius is putting together yet ANOTHER Director's cut of 1981's \\"Conan the Barbarian\\"... Are we STILL NOT going to get the original theatrical version of that one as well???    And what's up with that new extended version of \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" - Don't tell me that's the director's original intended version.  I don't think Sergio Leone would approve of excised footage being put back into his classic - SINCE THE ORIGINAL AUDIO WAS MISSING, and had to be re-recorded by [God love them] Clint and Eli (and someone else sitting in for a deceased Lee Van Cleef)... which is soooo jarring considering that the [living] actors simply sound like a parody of themselves 40+ years later.  Can we PLEASE have the ORIGINAL U.S. version (on Blu-Ray) that we've always known for the past 4 decades.    This is a sickness within the home-video/studio/film industry!!!    But yeah... as far as the original STAR WARS TRILOGY -- No ORIGINALS.... NO SALE!
0316056863|5.0|I just finished the book over the weekend and it was just plain funny. I have no other way to describe it other than Tina Fey really knows how to put a comedic and satirical spin on every observation she makes. I'm a student but moonlight as a clerk in my parents small retail store in Old Town, San Diego. I was there last Sunday and was reading Bossypants when I stumbled upon the most hilarious of all pages. After I read half the items on the \\"Me time\\" list on page 243 - I was in tears. Tina Fey says the things that go on in a normal woman's life but we're too afraid to even say it out loud. Here's an excerpt of the list:      ------      \\"Me Time\\"        Any expert will tell you, the best thing a mom can do to be a better mom is to carve out a little time for herself. Here are some great \\"me time\\" activities you can do.        - Go to the bathroom a lot.      - Offer to empty the dishwasher.      - Take ninety-minute showers. (If you only shower three or four days, it will be easier to get away with this).      - Say you're going to get diaper creme, then go into your child's room and stand there until your spouse comes in and curtly says, \\"What are you doing?\\"      - Stand over the sink and eat the rest of your child's dinner while he or she pulls at your pant leg asking for it back.      - Try to establish that you're the only one in your family allowed to go to the post office.        ------        By this point I was crying because I was laughing so hard and I could barely tend to the folksy, out-of-town tourist. If anyone reads anything this summer, it should definitely be Bossypants.
B001BYLFC6|4.0|My husband and I love this movie even though it has obvious flaws in the reality department. It's great to just turn your mind off and watch the action. we like the characters. They are also not believable, but lots of fun.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|If you have some DSLR and you are a semi-pro photographer this is the Flash for you.  I used in at my D5000 and I have no problem.  In TTL mode it works fine.  If you can't afford or don't want to buy the SB-900 this is the best choice for you.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|The Star Trek collection is awesome and the packaging is ok if you do not intend to store in the platic holders...I would recommend the other packaging as this one is really cheap and chincy...but hey, its Star Trek, how can you go wrong with this purchase!

6305076995|1.0|Dont waste your money...unless you are purchasing just add to your collection this one is horrible!  I did not realize the video (audio) was from the 1970's, as it is not listed in the advertising.  If you dont mind poor audio, go for it.  Dont get me wrong, the band is great and the concert would have been good to be at live, but the video and audio are poor quality.  If you are expecting, or hoping for a more modern rendition of \\"Yes\\", this is not it!  Buyer beware...(I suppose if you can pick this one up for under $5, you might not be as disappointed as I am, but dont forget about the shipping costs...)

B004S699K4|1.0|WHAT A RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!  We just got this movie in the mail today, sat down to find out that it is a cropped 1.78 version instead of the original 2.35 one that we have in regular DVD.  The sound is inferior 2.0 Stereo...in these days of everything being in 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound.  Obviously the people at Echo Bridge Entertainment are a bunch of greed-heads who are in it to RIP YOU OFF!!  Don't waste your time and especially your money buying this piece of CRAP!!!
B003V5PPZG|4.0|Music is life for me, and A Thousand Suns by Linkin Park is definitly one of my favorite little pieces of like. This music moves me, not the sound itself but the lyrics as well. Some may see them as depressing, I suppose. I, however, see them as uplifting and inspiring.     I hate when people put down Linkin Park. For them, like almost any great artist, music is a release for their emotions, a window so the outside world can see their feelings and thoughts. They should be appreciated for this, not disrespected. It takes a lot of guts to bare your soul to millions of people.     Anyway, this CD has some great songs. They are slow, but if you listen to the lyrics, you'll understand why I love them so much. Each song tells a story. Each flow of music is the background setting of the story. It's up to you to decide which story fits your personality best. For me, though, all of them are pretty dang good.
B004COCPTE|3.0|My kids giggled through this movie.  My husband and I found it rather stupid comedy, but loved watching the kids laugh so hard.  It's exactly what you think it is.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Music is life for me, and Minutes to Midnight by Linkin Park is definitly one of my favorite little pieces of life. I love Linkin Park, but this has most of my favorite songs on it. My number one is Leave Out All The Rest, with Shadow of the Day following in a close second.       These songs inspire me to be who I am, to not be afraid to be myself. They help me to gain confidence, believe in myself; they even give me inspiration for stories and books I write.      If you love Linkin Park and decide to buy this CD, you won't regret it.
B004G7FFF8|5.0|Wow! 98 CD's of outstanding composition and playing. This set provides evidence of List's contribution to the later romantic styles of Wagner, Mahler and early 20th century composers. This set gives the listener an idea of just how great a piano player Mr. List was. These recordings are technically excellent, although the Bosendorfer results in some high pitched reverberations that might have been eliminated  or reduced by use of some acoustic modifiers in place at the recording halls. But then, again, the resulting sound might not reflect the real Bosendorfer sound. I would have preferred the use of a Steinway, but that is just my personal preference, and not to take away anything from these fine performances.  This is just an outstanding contribution to recorded classical music and really fills a serious void in the catalog. This is more than the equivalent of the first complete recording of Wagner's Ring. The price is right, and the box and sleeves and booklet are first class. A \\"must\\" for collectors who want to broaden their knowledge of works heretofore unavailable.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Seriously George, buddy, you did something great and created a world that we all love and cherish. Then you told us it wasn't good enough and that it needed to be changed. Well most of us don't feel the same way and think that it was perfect just the way it was. Its yours to do with what you want, but I honestly will not be purchasing this product unless it really is the Star Wars i grew up with and loved. You have a great opportunity here to regain the trust and loyalty of legions of fans, don't waste it.
B000S5BUXI|5.0|The National are not conventional, you cannot breeze over this, it's too clever. Because after several times of constant listening, you will on chance see a random word, hear a random note, and then without realizing it you can't get one of these tunes to leave you alone. Songs on this album that were at one point less than desireable completely open up to you when you on a whim and you realize just how magnificent the lyircs are, how characteristic the guitar is, how pounding the drums sound. And then my friend, you will be hooked, and keep coming back for more.

B003KVNV4S|5.0|What we've got here is... A band that has gone past developed, and transitioned into singular entity of living breathing musical spectacular. Similar results can often be very boring and formulated, however every bit of these songs feels organic, and full of life. Fertile enough to create little miniature versions of themselves if they were ever allowed to mate. Berninger's lyrics seem to come as natural as the dialect he's been using since birth, each phrase full of powerful sub-tones, and themes within themes. The overall message of course being New York life, the excuses to leave, the late night misconceptions, the torture parties, etc. Each lyric backed with a group of melodies so tightly packed and distributed it could put UPS out of a job. The National have formulated a musical experience so well equipped for modern times, modern thinking, and modern listening that it may take a couple years to fully appreciate. Needless to say, the experience will leave you more than breathless, you may not wish to hear any other note from any other band, for a very long time.

0345444051|5.0|This book was my introduction to Arthur C. Clarke and it is still one of my favorite books ever. I think to call this science fiction is diminishing to what it actually is. Its a story not of fantastic events and how they impact humans,but what is really inside all of us and what the future if humanity might be. The incredible thing about Clarke is that he seems to have such clear and deep visions for the possibilities of man in the future.This book manages to be both apocalyptic and utopian at this same time. And its so short. Its almost blinding in its brilliance. I think the short length makes it even more enthralling and it burns bright for its entirety.His vision is so clear that there is no ambiguity when trying to imagineit. Clarke is truly a master, but I think the story is such a masterpiece on its own that it almost seems to stand alone without origin as a work of art. Incredible

B00127RAJY|5.0|This Jillian Michaels DVD offers three levels of intense, 20-minute workouts that are beautiful in their efficiency.  Based on her 3-2-1 philosophy, she leads you through 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs for 3 sets, with a warm-up and cool down segment.  But what's great about it is that you work your arms while you work your legs, making that 9 minutes of strength-training as efficient as 18 minutes of more isolated lifting.  Because the warm-up begins to elevate your heart rate even before you begin the first set of strength training and because you don't take any breaks throughout, the 20 minute work-out ensures that you get sustained aerobics benefits for the duration.  You will need a set of hand weights, or multiple sets if you plan to increase the weights as you progress.<br /><br />Michael is great at giving you the extra burst of determination when you most need it.  She'll tell you that you have only 30 seconds of strength exercises left or that she knows you want to give up or that you don't get good abs \\"for free.\\"  Her manner is somewhat gruff, but boy, does it work.  Who would have thought that a video would keep you on track, that it would make you feel as though you HAD to continue?  This part is perhaps even more valuable that the efficient, high-intensity workout.  The only downside is that you cannot skip the introduction, so you have to listen to Jillian Michael's workout philosophy and plan every time.<br /><br />Michael's recommends that everyone start with Level 1 -- and there's a reason for that.  Keeping up that kind of intensity, even for someone who is in shape, is not easy, especially during the strength training which uses multiple muscle groups at once.  I play tennis several times a week, so I'm in relatively good shape, but the Level 1 workout had me sweating five minutes in.<br /><br />For those who don't like dance-style or coordination-heavy aerobics, this DVD may be especially welcome.  You don't need to figure out any special moves since each exercise is straightforward.  You don't need to be coordinated beyond being able to do a jumping jack, although more coordination is needed for the higher levels.<br /><br />This workout got results, fast.  Even at Level 1, I felt the difference in just five days.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmannecial moves since each exercise is straightforward.

0446364495|5.0|I heard so much about the movie, before watching it, I wanted to read this book. It is a very firm prose that is poetic and light. Please ignore the 3 stars and go for it. You'll like it.

I will not purchase any Star Wars film on blu-ray except a restored, archival version of the films many of us older fans first experienced and love. Please let us enjoy the films as we remember them.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|I got into Fringe late and had to go back and view the first season.  This is a great series even my husband go into it.  I love character driven stories and science fiction but sometimes the writers get carried away with their own mythos and forget about the character i.e. Lost.  This show has not suffer yet from this problem.  The characters and the story are great.  I hope they can keep it up.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this based on the Amazon reviews. I'm usually disappointed when I buy a cd from one of the new artists, but this cd, which is her second, is strong throughout. Well written tunes, simple arrangements, not over produced like so much of the crappy music these days, and this young woman can really sing. She does cool things with her voice without over signing like so many of the over-hyped singers these days and she has soul. I finally got to see her perform on TV, one song on Dancing With The Stars, and she is a brilliant live performer. The best videos on youtube are the live ones from Jools Hollanders Late Nite show, amazing. On her first CD 19, her phrasing and style is a bit all over the place, obviously trying to find her own style and copying others, but the album is good. On this, her second album, 21, she stamps out her own indelible style and it is distinctly Adele. I've had the cd a couple of months now and I never tire of listening to it. All the songs are about a relationship and they are gut wrenching and passionate with strong lyrics. Adele is the real deal; a very good song writer and a great, soulful singer. This is one of the best albums in years by any performer and Adele is the number one selling recording artist in the world. As of this update on June 27, 2011, this cd has been number 1 on the global charts for 16 weeks this year. It has sold over 7 million copies (digital and hard copy). If you are a romantic or have ever been in love you will relate to these songs.
B0038M2AZA|4.0|Very fast delivery, several days before I expected it.  One little problem, when I try to watch this DVD on some computers, I have to change some kind of a country spesific zone ID to be allowed to play it. On other computers I am never asked to change this zone ID. May be amazon should inform foreign customers in what zones the DVD is allowed to be played.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|would have given 5 stars but there was two issues.  1.)  For APs in the 802.11a Band (5800 MHz) dont say simply &quot;unknown&quot; for the channel assignment.  Look it up.  There is an FCC table for this.   Lets see....   63 is lowest channel and 141 is the highest.  2.)  On samsung tab, the scan rate is not whats advertised.  A setting of &quot;1 second&quot; yields about a 3 to 4 seconds display update.  &quot;5 seconds&quot; results in more like 10 seconds display update.  Etc.  etc.   Other than that, the app is pretty useful.
0316056863|5.0|I enjoyed it.  It had a few really 'I laughed so hard I snorted' moments and the stories actually had hidden gems of advice.  One of the best parts was her story about her father, Don Fey, and the The Worldwide Parental Anxiety System, or what I like to call 'your parents putting the fear of God in you'.  Plus the prayer for when her daughter grows up had me rolling.  Short read but very entertaining.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|Doesn't do justice to any of the characters. An entertaining story any way but not up to snuff for Connelly.

It is, rather, only a play (with an audience).<br /><br />Have not been able to ascertain how much of the book has been abridged but it appears to be only a short version. This version is comprised of only two discs and only has 37 tracks. Pathetic and a rip-off.<br /><br />This should NOT be included in the audio book section of Amazon. I'm not sure what category it belongs in but it is not an audio book.<br /><br />LW

B003XX2PD6|3.0|Where for the first four songs your ready to write them off for the underwater Beach Boys stuff, sans Brian Wilson's careful voice. I found myself longing for a Kurt Cobain acoustic demo while suffering through \\"Sailing.\\" Then for two songs, \\"Memory Boy,\\" \\"Helicopter,\\" the Jesus and Mary Chain-like \\"Fountain Stairs\\" and \\"Desire Lines,\\" Bradford Cox discovers more melody and less ambiance; recalling early REM and The Feelies. The evolutionary change is so sudden it's staggering, and dare I say the last 3 minutes of \\"Desire Lines\\" is swimming in all transcendence. Still falls short of Girls' \\"Broken Dreams Club\\" as far as pure pop beauty--though, for a band that often prefers the gravel percussion sound, such distinctions are irrelevant.

1401309666|3.0|Anderson's central idea, that the new realities of the information economy have fundamentally changed the rules of distribution and profit, is an interesting one and certainly offers promise for many different industries.    However, the book is simultaneously lengthy and superficial.  Anderson does not significantly engage with economic or cultural theory, nor does he consider critically any of the implications of this shift in distribution.  Like many writing about technological innovation, Anderson often seems to think of this change entirely in utopian terms without any consideration for the job, traditions, and cultures that may be disrupted or effaced.    And yet, this book is still some 200+ pages long.  Interesting thesis, but in its current incarnation, this book should have been about 100 pages at a maximum.
0743270754|4.0|This was the first major piece I read about Lincoln, and I'm very glad I picked it up.  Apart from being a fantastic historical account, it was also one of the books President Obama read in preparation for his presidency.  After reading this book, it's very apparent Obama took many cues from Lincoln - even some of his rhetoric (\\"better angels\\").  In that sense, this book offers the reader the opportunity to both learn some fascinating history, and understand our own times better.    I found myself frustrated at several points in the latter half of the book.  There are many instances in which Dr. Goodwin provides a narrative of events as filler.  Such filler may be important in setting context, but often times, it bears no relation to the central tenet of the book, which is Lincoln's high political acumen.  After getting through some big chunks of this book, I'd still be asking myself \\"Okay, how does this relate to Lincoln's thinking?  How does it illustrate his political genius?\\"    Of course, a lot of the time I may have simply been frustrated with Lincoln.  His true political genius - as becomes very apparent in this read - was his ability to remove himself from petty squabbles and maintain a cool head.  This often involved biting his tongue and refraining from reprimanding subordinates and colleagues who were outwardly belligerent.  More often than not, Lincoln's rivals defeated themselves, and it was his wise inaction that prevailed.  I often found myself thinking back to Dale Carnegie's referring to Lincoln in the first chapter of \\"How to Win Friends & Influence People\\", in which he posits that Lincoln was successful because he never reprimanded or belittled those around him, even when he was surely in the right.  \\"Team of Rivals\\" is an extended study of that assertion.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|What makes a good action flick? Who knows for sure? But this one has it all, whatever it is!<br /><br />The family is back, and this time, they are re-recruiting many of the actors from the other four F & F's. As an added bonus, Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson and the 5'3\\" extreme hottie, Elsa Pataky, are on board as well. ALL of the F & F flicks are a bit short on storyline, but who needs a lot of pondering, yawn-inducing love stories, and brain-damaging twists to make the best picture of the spring? Not Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, or Paul Walker, that's for sure.<br /><br />After Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) break Mia's brother, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), out of a bus transporting prisoners to their final destination, prison, we soon find them all shacking up in South America. Although the entire train scene was edge-of-your-seat, the real white-knuckled fun starts in Brazil, and there ain't too much \\"shacking up\\" going on here either. The story is a bit thin, so for me to elaborate on it would give it away in totality, however, I can tell you that the story is exactly what it's supposed to be...perfect and not too over-the-top for what the movie is trying to do, which is bringing on the action, relieving the tension with occasional humor (VERY funny stuff, by the way), the rooting for the good guys (who are essentially bad to a degree), the serious love between the Toretto's (Dom, Mia, and their brother, Vince), and their love for O'Conner. It's a tight-clique buddy-flick, like \\"The Losers\\" and \\"The Expendables,\\" but MUCH better than the former and even a bit better than the latter.<br /><br />All of the five-star reviews you're seeing on Amazon, Rotten Tomatoes, and Blu-Ray.com are the real deal. You honestly feel for these people, and you care what happens to them. The action sequences are top-notch, well-filmed, and superior to anything I have seen recently, or ever, for that matter. There is some truly incredible stuff going on here...especially the whole vault scene, which was absolutely awesome, to say the least.<br /><br />If you like action flicks, PLEASE don't miss this one. It has everything you're looking for and more. Also, make sure you stick around for a final scene after the credits roll. This scene tells us that there is NO QUESTION about a F & F Part Six coming up in the near future.<br /><br />One more note: If you haven't seen any of the first four movies, at the very least, watch the first one, \\"The Fast And The Furious,\\" before checking out \\"Fast Five.\\" It will get you in tune with the main characters. I believe it would be hard to pick up on the depth of these people without knowing some of their back-stories first.<br /><br />Fast Five is the best movie of the spring so far and one of the best action movies ever made. FIVE STARS HARD! *****hole vault scene, which was absolutely awesome, to say the least.    If you like action flicks, PLEASE don't miss this one. It has everything you're looking for and more.

1573229725|5.0|This is my third novel of Waters', and I believe it is the best.<br /><br />Waters deftly led me through the Burrough of London to a house of thieves, thento Briar ~ a country manor.  She introduced me to Susan and Maud, to Gentleman and Mrs. Sucksby and to all of the characters in between, to where I feel as if I could describe them as if they were my family members.<br /><br />Waters threaded me through a storyline of twists and turns, through madhouses, betrayals and murder.  She warmed my heart with a love story that I thoroughly enjoyed reading.  It is rare that I come across a book such as this.  I will pass it along to my family and friends and wholeheartedly give it five stars.
B004IQMXD4|4.0|Unless you've been hiding under a rock, or ignoring my facebook posts for the last 6 weeks, you know I've been counting down to today, the release of 'In Your Dreams' Stevie Nicks' first studio album since 2001's 'Trouble in Shangri-La.' I have listened a few times today, and now I'm sitting here, listening again, while sipping a Stevie Nicks Martini (Ask, and you shall receive instructions on how to make this delicious cocktail)  Stevie has reclaimed the title of Queen of Rock with this album. Her voice, her songwriting are all in top form. But we also need to give kudos to Dave Stewart (of The Eurythmics) for his production, and for rekindling Stevie's passion, which is evident throughout this album.   It will probably take me a while to absorb this album as a whole, it's still a collection of songs to me, each individual, with it's own merits, and I am having trouble seeing the Big Picture. That will come with time, I am confident.   The album opens with Secret Love, a song written in 1976. I think it's a good opener, classic Nicks, but nothing special. It eases the listener in, assuring you that, whatever comes next, this is still Stevie Nicks.   For What It's Worth is a worthy successor to 'Landslide' in it's simplicity, honesty, and emotion. Anthony Lower and I have already decided that this is our song.   The title track, is fast and fun. It's also so hopeful. This is a Summer Song, one you listen to while driving around town, with the top down and the speakers blasting.   Now we get funky!! Wide Sargasso Sea is intense, free form, and musically, very different than any other Nicks track. I can't say it's my favorite (to early to tell), but I listen to it the most.  How can you describe New Orleans without using the word 'haunting?' Full of ghosts, vampires, and Anne Rice. Emotionally, it tugs at my heart in a way I cannot describe. Even though it was written for the residents of New Orleans after Katrina hit, it also reminds me of someone very close to me. We bonded over Anne Rice and Julian Mayfair (remember?)  Speaking of vampires, Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream) is a reworking of an old demo (Lady From The Mountain) with a new chorus and a new verse thrown in. Stevie has mentioned that she revisited the song after watching Twilight: New Moon. I forgive her for that, because it's a really good song.   Annabelle Lee is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. Stevie set it to music years ago. The demo has been floating around for a while, and I've been really hoping she would record it. Much to my delight, the finished product is lovely. Ok, the album might be a whole picture for me yet, but I do love the sequencing of those last 3 songs, they flow together very well.  In 1991, Stevie wrote a song called 'Desert Angel,' dedicated to the troops serving in the first Gulf War. She got a lot of flack from fans, because of the hokey lyrics. I tended to like it, but I live in the desert. I think the idea she had in writing that song was never fully realized, until she recorded Soldier's Angel for this album. Simply done, it's just Stevie, accompanied by Lindsey Buckingham on guitar and vocals (maybe some drums thrown in). Heartbreaking tribute to the men and women and what they have seen and experienced, though Stevie's eyes.   Everybody Loves You the requisite Stevie Nicks song about how hard it is to be a Rock Star, but so well done, it makes you ignore her other forays into this territory.  Ghosts are Gone is Angry Stevie. It's a hard rocker, with a great beat. I found myself playing air tambourine!!  If there is a weak link in this album, You May Be The One is it. It's not necessarily a bad song, I think it just doesn't match up to the eloquence of the rest of the songs.   I had a conversation last night with someone about the stages of love, and the last two tracks really hit on some of the things we discussed. Italian Summer is full and rich and so full of romance. You can almost smell the roses and feel the spray of the Mediterranean on your face as you listen to it. It's Big, It's Spectacular, It's So Soulful. It's all about Romance...  Cheaper Than Free is that other kind of love song. It's a great duet about the simplicity of real love. No strings, no roses, nothing but the expressions of how good it is to have someone you love in your life. It's a perfect closer to the album.      What's brighter than a smile? You child.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I wont be persuaded into buying, this no matter how much clearer the picture. You have proven once again that what the FANS actually want (the ORIGINAL films in widescreen)... is not your concern. I am happy to keep my hard earned cash and support something else.
0345479092|1.0|This book was a major waste of time for me. I bought it because my baby has been waking up at night and hasn't learned how to go back to sleep on his own. I don't want to use the cry out method and was looking for an alternative. First off it didn't talk about teaching your baby how to fall asleep on his own Other than a very short section on the so called \\"pick up put down\\" method. This method only works if your baby is soothed just by picking him up. If he stops crying then, you can try this method. But if he doesn't there are no alternatives presented. The remainder of the book tries to tell you how to interpret your baby's signs. Might be helpful for someone who is starting with this book and hasn't read any others yet. But it didn't cover anything that I've read before and done better in other books. There is a chart of different baby cries and what they mean, which is worthless because you can't really decipher her descriptions, first off, and 2nd, every baby's cries are different and mean something unique to that baby. Finally, the book is poorly edited or not at all (I don't need to read a British nurse referring to the reader as \\"luv\\" on the page and frequently throughout the book). This book is dumbed down and I didn't get the sense that it was based on anything substantiated, just one woman's experiences.
0439023521|3.0|There must have been something intriguing about the book because I listened to the whole thing on CDs and am now making my way through Catching Fire, but I have to say there was alot about this book I DIDN'T like:  1) Totally unbelievable dystopian society. Sorry, I didn't buy it. As if a totalitarian government would choose to flex its muscle by spending countless resources to put together an annual reality TV show. Please. Is there nothing else going on in the world to distract this government?  2) Katniss, a 16 yo girl who spends her days running through the forest with a handsome and capable boy, claims to have never thought of him \\"in that way\\" before? Nor does she pick up on Peeta's feelings for her?  As a woman who remembers what it was like to be 16, this is totally fiction.  3) The idea that mass social uprisings could hinge on a handful of berries and whether two people are really in love or not is so unrealistic, even in this fantasy world, that it's insulting to the occupants of it. It's just not strong enough to fuel the fear in the government that the novel implies.  4) Katniss' tolerance of her fashion entourage from the Capital is utterly baffling. These people represent everything that is wrong with the world and yet somehow she grows to like them? I don't buy the argument that she had no choice. All that time they were plucking and tweezing and primping her, she could have been telling them about the real living conditions she and her district endure back home. Yet she was surprisingly subdued for a girl known for speaking her mind.    This book seriously tested my ability to suspend disbelief.    Having said that, there was one thing that was refreshing: A young female protagonist who is good in a fight. We need more of these. Unfortunately, the world she inhabited was so unbelievable in my mind that I'm afraid she got lost in the soup sandwich mess that is Panem.
0062060554|5.0|A very unique and fascinating book.  Even though the pace of the plot seemed to be slow, I read late into the night because it was so interesting.  I vacillated from one idea to another and yet it was not until almost the end of the book that what was happening became clear.  I do not want to add more to my critique so that there will be no spoilers.
0061537969|5.0|I am a rabid reader--I go through at least two books a week.  I hesitated before buying The Art of Racing in the Rain because (1) it really didn't sound that interesting to me (race car driving??), 2) I absolutely cannot stand sad stories about animals; they affect me more than sad stories about humans, and (3) I'm really a cat person. But I take notice when over a thousand reviewers give a book an average of 4 1/2 stars.  I am so glad I took the chance--this book is absolutely wonderful.  Stein does a fantastic job with his characterizations and, as an added bonus, tells a moving story.  I give it a solid five stars.  Buy it--it's worth it.

0300169787|5.0|... BUY THIS BOOK! This book serves as a wonderful compendium of McQueen's work. The collections noted range from \\"Jack the ripper stalks his victims\\" through \\"Angels and Demons\\". If I were to nit-pick: A - some of the photos could have benefited from better lighting and B - there needed to be more examples from his tenure at Givenchy. Not all of his collections are on display at the Met exhibit and so in this book, not all of his collections are used (Neptune, Pantheon Ad Lectum, etc.). I have not finished reading the passages in the forward, nor the interview with Sara Burton, but this book is more of a visual feast than a good read. The size is comparable to the price and the quality of the book is excellent. I'm still waiting for a giant 1,000 page book on his entire career, but in the mean time, this catalog will suffice nicely!
B003OWVHVC|5.0|Thank you \\"Mob Wives\\" I heard \\"Loving You is Killing Me\\", I Google the lyrics and came across this album. I love it, it makes me smile :) All the tracks are stand out but I really like \\"Green Lights\\" because I can relate! Can listen through the whole album all the way w/o skipping, a mark of a great album, I hate skipping through most of an album. I love the fact no auto-tune, which is fine when appropriate. Aloe's voice is great, a man that has beautiful deep voice, inflection and great lyrics.
B0041KKYBA|2.0|This documentary was a wasted opportunity.  It portends that a massive crime was perpetrated on the country in the crisis, but it fails to name the crime other than the tangential use of prostitutes and drugs by some bankers.  Not to minimize the crime of prostitution, but, that whole bit was so completely asinine, it shows the lack of understanding that the film makers had of the issues at stake in the crisis.  The fact is that no laws appear to have been broken in arriving at the crisis.  The banks generally acted within the regulatory frameworks and laws that were in force at the time.  It is true that the banks tried to, often successfully, modify the laws that governed their businesses, but this is not a crime, nor is it different than any other industry.  Moreover, while the compensation arrangements are not designed to result in long term thinking, it is true that a number of senior executives, such as Dick Fuld - Lehman's CEO, were hammered by the crash.  The fact of the matter is the banks did not do well in this crisis, which is why they needed to be bailed out.  Put differently, the banks did not profit.  If they had, they would not have needed the bail outs.  To me personally, the story of the crisis is incredibly complex and simple at the same time.  It boils down to greed.  Home buyers were extremely greedy and bought houses that they could not have reasonably expected that they could have afforded.  For example, the one homeowner in the film that describes being put into an adjustable rate mortgage that screwed them fails to describe that the loan amount was well north of $500,000.  Not many people on salaries less than $200,000 per year let alone less than $100,000 per year could reasonably expect to pay that type of mortgage regardless of whether or not it was an adjustable rate mortgage.  The fact of the matter is that they decided to buy something that they could not have expected to be able to repay.  This greed stretched up and down the social chain from the middle class home buyer, to the mortgage servicer, to the mortgage bundler, to the CDO purchaser.  Everyone was greedy and we all paid a collective price for that, but no one is willing to look in the mirror and take personal responsibility for it.  This film further perpetuates that mentality, by demonizing certain easy targets in the crisis, but it fails to take a more circumspect view of the crisis.  In point of fact, the SEC complaint against Goldman Sachs for the synthetic CDO that it sold (Timberwolf I believe) was complete crap.  A synthetic CDO is comprised of cash flows from Credit Default Swaps (CDS).  By definition, a synthetic CDO has to be made of bets against the mortgage securities underlying it, and if you look at the offering documents for this synthetic CDO it actually has a diagram showing that someone is betting against the underlying mortgage reference securities.  Nonetheless, the SEC and the news outlets, and the film, make it out as if this was some hidden fact.    The only reason that I did not give the film one star is that it did put the role of academics under a microscope, which was helpful.  It was potentially slanted, as the rest of the film clearly was, but it is an important footnote that should be understood.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Originally from Adams' hometown of Quincy, Mass, John Adams has always been my 'favorite' Founding Father. Author Joseph Ellis, is the forward to his book Founding Brothers, says that, unlike the other leading players, Adams (though as aware as the others that he was playing an important role in American history) could not 'hold the pose.' He could not put aside what made him human so that he might be better regarded by history.    That's what you see in this series: Adams, warts and all. A brilliant, yet flawed, man. A truly great, principled man.     His extraordinary Abigail - wife and best friend - is shown in all her glory. In another time, she would have made a successful leader herself - perhaps better than John. In the 21st century, she might have made us proud as the first female US president. Yet we see some of what made her human, too.    Many have written that this story does not follow David McCullough's outstanding book very well, especially in the early years. Be that as it may, it follows closely enough to satisfy the historian in me.     The 'son Charles as out-of control alcoholic' subplot of later programs was perhaps highlighted because it makes one wonder how difficult it must be to be the son of such a man. I have often wondered how John Quincy turned out to be the public servant he was while Charles' path was so much more difficult. John Quincy certainly had his flaws - how could any son of Abigail Adams grow up not to respect women and treat his wife so shabily? - but of course lived a long, generally much more worthy of praise life than all of his brothers.    Only one thing: every time the actors went by the Adams houses during the Revolutionary War, they were going in the wrong direction! The General is hauling those cannons.... towards Cape Cod!

0316044938|4.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is about a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon who gets murdered.  While she is in heaven, she watches her family trying to find her murderer.    I really love this book.  What I love is that Susie is the narrator, and she takes you through her life in heaven.  I also enjoy the dialogue because, in my opinion, when they're talking, you feel as if you are in the room with them.  My favorite part of the book is \\"Bones\\" because it is a summary of everyone Susie cared for after they got over Susie's death.    What I didn't enjoy is there were too many details.  For example, Susie would watch her father from heaven.  Then she would talk about her and her father playing outside.  It got rather confusing.  Another thing I did not like is the rape and sex scene.  It got too detailed.
B00177YEFM|5.0|Great gift for a Star Wars lover. My son loves it. Plugs into a USB port on the computer and lights up.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Own all three seasons and waiting for the 4th to come out.  Love the show and now love to have marathons of watching it over again.  I keep telling more friends about this show.  They see a few and fall in love too.  Then, we have to watch the old ones together.      The humor is mixed for both physics/engineering types and those who are not.  I was a physics major, so I understand that aspect of it, but have plenty of friends who are not science-oriented and think it's hilarious.  They don't get all of the jokes, but there are plenty to keep it a great show for them too.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Inside Job is a well documented expose of the Wall Street debacle. It clearly delineates the historic and rapid abandonment of the financial regulation that sent America into the worst recession since the Great Depression.    The culpability for such abandonment and the resultant decline of our American wealth, is well chronicled.     Responsibility for this colossal failure lies the words and deeds of presidents from Clinton to Obama, as well as our congress, the regulators, well-paid academic apologists, and most of all the Wall Street criminals themselves.    The documentary is exceptionally well made, a visually stunning pastiche of a terrible national disaster.  It should be shown and discussed in every American history classroom in the nation.
B0039W1J0Q|3.0|Peter Gabriel is a national treasure and I am sadly old enough to admit to seeing Genesis at Bristol's Colston Hall in 1973 where Gabriel was mesmerizing. When I saw them next at Knebworth in 1978 he wasn't in the band and I preferred Devo (unlike the majority of the crowd!). Gabriel has always ploughed his own furrow and his development of WOMAD deserves a knighthood. He has a great sense of humour and his recent cover with Hot Chip of \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" by Vampire Weekend is a wicked gem.<br /><br />\\"Scratch my back\\" is not just a covers album it's about song exchange with the different artists covered pledging to return the favour. I had hoped that Gabriel's album could do a \\"Joni Mitchell\\". When the great lady revisited her standards the mature reading that she produced through a voice that was no longer angelic but infused with a life of experience and backed by a stirring orchestra was superb. Songs like \\"Both Sides Now\\" sounded better than the originals.<br /><br />Gabriel's covers are certainly well chosen and show impeccable taste (although \\"My Body is a cage\\" is a least favourite Arcade Fire song), the problem is that some work incredibly well while other fall flat. Thus Gabriel's version of Bon Iver's \\"Flume\\" for instance is workmanlike and misses the mark. His reading of Neil Young's \\"Philadelphia\\" never quite captures the quiet desperation and sheer sadness to be found on the original. When we finally get a cover like Radiohead's \\"Street Spirit\\" that is so radically reworked that it is almost unrecognizable to the original, you punch the air. The trouble is that it just does not work and is mournful and dreadfully dull. Indeed my dog gave me a dirty look when I played it! \\"I think its going to rain today\\" by Randy Newman takes a brave singer to attempt and again Gabriel's version stays so close that it is almost a reprise and as such can't really add much. Sorry when it comes to David Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" why tamper with perfection?<br /><br />The good news is that \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" (Paul Simon) is excellent. Indeed for the first time ever you realise what a subversive lyric underpins the song which is sung with crystal clarity by Gabriel. The \\"Listening Wind\\" (Talking Heads) cover is I think actually better than the original. Its interesting that Gabriel is most at home here with the African related songs. Thus the Talking Heads original is slowed down to a much sadder and reflective piece. I can't comment on \\"Power of the Heart\\" the Lou Reed cover since I have never heard the original but Gabriel's take is lovely. Elbows \\"Mirrorball\\" works really well for Gabriel's voice indeed he has compared it to singing a difficult Genesis song. The orchestration works brilliantly on this as it does on the cover of Stephen Merritt's wonderful \\"Book of Life\\". Gabriel's version is a knockout.<br /><br />Look I'm not saying don't buy this album since it is a fascinating attempt by a major artist to deconstruct and reconstruct a set of songs which are on the whole faultlessly chosen. You just wish it was a bit more unique and that a greater exercise of re -imagination had occurred.oy in the Bubble\\" (Paul Simon) is excellent.

0439023513|5.0|I really can't think of a more fitting ending to this series than the route Collins decided to take. Would it have really been believable for Katniss to ride off into the sunset with minimal damage after she's been through so much? I've seen a lot of reviews in which readers became disenchanted with Katniss's deteriorating drive (for lack of a better word) after being rescued from the 2nd games, but in the context of the book, she is only a 17 year old, HUMAN, girl. She's not miraculous or endowed with super powers. Naturally, neither Peeta nor Katniss would ever be the same after all the events of their life. Likewise, Collins never makes Katniss out to be a saint, either. I've seen a lot of reviews that site her inability (yes, inability) to vote \\"no\\" to the post-war Hunger Games as a weakness and character flaw on Katniss's part, but don't we live in a society that still has the death penalty for that very reason - revenge? I think the point is Katniss does the best with what she has. She truly never stops fighting, even when Peeta comes back irrevocably damaged.     I only had two issues with the book.     While I understand why Katniss voted in favor of the Hunger Games, I think that point was her chance to break from the status quo and she misses the opportunity entirely. I really have to think that Katniss would have pulled back at this point and realized that this was not the best choice. Also, how did Peeta reconcile Katniss's blood lust later in the book (Collins never really addresses that).     My second big issue was not with the way the book resolved itself, but in the manner. Certainly, Collins makes it clear that Katniss and Peeta grow together, but I think part of the resolution has to be how that happened. If she's trying to make a statement that \\"life goes on\\", wouldn't she want to specify how these two damaged people picked up the pieces? It is only on this one point that I felt Collins just got lazy and missed the mark. There are way too many unanswered questions. Why did Peeta come back? Why did he give Katniss a second chance? How did he overcome his demons? Why did Katniss ultimately decide to have kids? Was it just because Peeta wanted them or because the world was a better place? Where the heck did Haymitch go after it was all said and done? Collins hints that he (Haymitch) does interact with Peeta and Katniss, but you would think he would become a prominent figure in their lives after the war ends.     I hope that when the movie comes out (if they make the entire series) that they will consider addressing these issues (with Collins's input, of course). I think that would at least make up for the lack of detail in the final chapter.
B003UESJH4|5.0|In contrast to the Academy's puzzling choice of Best Picture in 2010 (the instantly forgettable `The Hurt Locker'), in 2011 the award of Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay to this fine film seems to have been anticipated by all and greeted with universal acclaim.<br /><br />The story is one which most viewers will already know, so spoiler alerts ought to be unnecessary. The stammer suffered by King George VI (known as the Duke of York in public and `Bertie' in private prior to his wholly unexpected and unlooked-for coronation, following his elder brother's sudden abdication in 1936), especially whilst speaking in public, had defeated even the most able speech therapists laden with high medical credentials. Bertie's wife Elizabeth (played by Helena Bonham-Carter in one of her best-ever roles) sought out Lionel Logue, a highly unconventional Australian with no formal qualifications in speech therapy who employed self-taught, unorthodox but highly effective techniques developed whilst treating traumatised survivors of the WW1 trenches to speak again. The development of an improbable relationship of trust and mutual respect between Colin Firth's Bertie and Geoffrey Rush's Logue is at the heart of the drama; explored with intelligence, poignancy and sharp humour, it's one of the best realised screenplays of recent years.<br /><br />The first-class acting tour-de-force from the two male leads is boosted by a stellar supporting cast: the aforementioned Ms. Bonham-Carter as the Duchess of York/Queen Elizabeth; Michael Gambon in excellent form as George V (whose untimely demise initiated the constitutional crisis); Guy Pearce as the less-than-sympathetic Edward VIII; Jennifer Ehle as Lionel's wife Myrtle and Tim Spall hamming it up as Winston Churchill. Tom Hooper's direction is a textbook lesson in how to involve an audience from first frame to last by using fine character actors delivering a first-class script, snappy editing, pacy and involving storyline, witty and intelligent one-liners and a tension-packed but ultimately triumph-over-adversity-feelgood ending.<br /><br />The film has received some minor criticisms for its compression of real-life timescales: Bertie and Logue in reality began working together as early as 1926 and Bertie's stammer was much improved after only a few months; Churchill was not PM nor even in the Cabinet on the declaration of war in September 1939 and no cheering crowds greeted the King's outbreak-of-war speech, and so on. However the film is not a documentary but a piece of drama, and these few liberties are taken (as in many a decent drama) to enable it to work effectively in a 2-hour timeframe.<br /><br />The plaudits surrounding `The King's Speech' are entirely justified, as are the basket of top-level awards it's scooped. It's entertaining, clever and edge-of-seat riveting. Colin Firth's performance in particular is a marvel, and will likely be one of the best you'll see this year.<br /><br />'The King's Speech' is everything a truly great film should be, and a deserving multiple award-winner.oryline, witty and intelligent one-liners and a tension-packed but ultimately triumph-over-adversity-feelgood ending.<br /><br />The film has received some minor criticisms for its compression of real-life timescales: Bertie and Logue in reality began working together as early as 1926 and Bertie's stammer was much improved after only a few months; Churchill was not PM nor even in the Cabinet on the declaration of war in September 1939 and no cheering crowds greeted the King's outbreak-of-war speech, and so on.

B003XL6EKS|5.0|I am not a huge fan of today's music scene; in fact, I am quite out-of-touch. Brandon Flowers and the Killers are the exception, though. I find Flowers' writing style and very presence quite an enigma on the music scene. In an industry that glamorizes hedonism, excess, and self-indulgence, Brandon not only remains in touch with his spiritual roots, but goes so far as to openly explore them.    I know that a lot of people who are not religious may have found this album a bit too much, but in my estimation, it was another chapter in his own spiritual journey -- a journey which I have found fascinating since the release of \\"Sam's Town.\\" Given the enormous part that religion plays in his own life, I was expecting at least some spiritual content on this album. Boy, was I surprised -- and pleasantly so. This album is literally saturated in spirituality. Given my own Christian beliefs, I very much appreciated this effort, although I guess I can understand why some people might be turned off.    Even so, this album not only entertained me, but moved me, spoke to me, and made me think. I find it quite courageous that Brandon is even willing to explore such things. He bares his soul and touches on subjects that most people would deem too \\"controversial\\" for mainstream. Not since the late, great George Harrison has an artist (at least a secular artist) come forth so boldly and proclaimed his beliefs so openly. Of course, Brandon has never been one to keep his opinion or feelings to himself.    My favorite tracks on this album are \\"Only The Young,\\" \\"On The Floor,\\" and \\"Swallow It.\\" It is a refreshing listen after the disappointment (IMO) that was \\"Day and Age.\\" The only songs that I really don't like off of this album are \\"Jacksonville\\" and \\"Right Behind You.\\" While I do not agree with his belief system, I still find myself personally enriched by this work.

0312370849|2.0|This book was not awful, but it was poorly written.  At first, you care about the characters, but the main character is so irrational that you eventually lose touch with her.  The author asks so many questions that you eventually become to tired to answer.  The book discusses interesting topics, and the characters endure unique experiences - yet in the end, you just don't care anymore.  I'm almost proud of myself for finishing this one.

Josh Brolin and Megan Fox are quite good, and Malkovich is his usual villainous self, though better in \\"Dangerous Liasions\\" and \\"In The Line Of Fire.\\" (Why is it he can't do an accent?) Passable film. Stick with \\"Law Abiding Citizen.\\" Rated PG-13.
B004X0XA82|4.0|From the likes of The Decemberists and Bon Iver to Mumford & Sons and Blitzen Trapper, indie folk seems to be a nationwide trend especially in the pacific northwest. It pays homage to music of the 60s and 70s with a bit of a country music tinge thrown in. Seattle's Fleet Foxes are one of the forerunners of this genre and site acts like Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul & Mary, Neil Young, Crosby, Stills & Nash, and Ennio Morricone as inspiration for their music, especially their new album which releases nationwide on May 3rd.<br /><br />\\"I was raised up believing I was somehow unique... but I'd rather be a functioning cog in some great machinery\\" lead singer and primary songwriter Robin Pecknold sings on the title track of Fleet Foxes' sophomore album \\"Helplessness Blues.\\" The theme of this album, Pecknold says, \\"is the struggle between who you are and who you want to be or who you want to end up, and how sometimes you are the only thing getting in the way of that.\\"<br /><br />The theme of addressing life after newfound fame paired with formidable song arrangements have made \\"Helplessness Blues\\" a real gem to flannel-wearing bearded guys all over. Okay... other people will love it too.<br /><br />Fleet Foxes first and self-titled album was released in 2008 and their follow-up was meant to be recorded that same year. But due to an overwhelming and frankly unexpected positive reaction to the first album, subsequent touring and promotion shelved it temporarily.<br /><br />After several other unseen forces such as illness, scheduling, creative doubt, and rewriting, \\"Helplessness Blues\\" was finally finished in December of 2010. It was recorded at several places: what used to be Seattle's Hall of Justice until Death Cab For Cutie moved out, in Woodstock New York at Dreamland Recording, and finally back in Seattle at several other studios including Avast! Recording Co. where bands such as Band of Horses, Soundgarden, and The Shins have also recorded.<br /><br />Pecknold describes the album as, \\"a synthesis of folk rock, traditional folk & psychedelic pop, with an emphasis on group vocal harmonies,\\" the latter of which is in true Fleet Foxes fashion. The first album was full of bountiful and intricate vocal harmonies on songs like \\"Sun It Rises,\\" \\"Quiet Houses,\\" and \\"He Doesn't Know Why.\\" As a whole it was very echoey and delicate, yet at the same time concrete and exquisitely crafted. Every word sounds like it is being sung from the end of a long hallway with the microphone at the other end. It almost felt like an accidental success, as though the band set out to solely make music that appealed to them. But as it turns out, it appealed to many others as well, not to mention the fact that their second album taking as long as it has to release, has left people eager for more.<br /><br />Intricate vocals and harmonies are still one of the focal points of the Fleet Foxes experience with \\"Helplessness Blues.\\" From that standpoint Fleet Foxes seem to be operating under an if-it's-not-broken-don't-fix-it mentality which has the potential to get old if continually recycled but for now is working well.<br /><br />Instrumentation plays a much more significant role on this album. In addition to traditional instrumentation, the likes of much more unique sounds are present such as hammered dulcimer, zither, wood flute, tympani, tamboura, fiddle, clarinet, Tibetan singing bowls, and vibraphone.<br /><br />Although this album took much more time than intended to make and release it is easy to see that Fleet Foxes have found their niche and are looking for ways to expound upon that. They even take the time to throw in a lot of instrumentals (such as the song \\"The Cascades\\") here and there which is a welcome treat on any album.<br /><br />The title track stands out not only musically but lyrically as well. The theme of introspection and overcoming one's own limitations to find success is as appealing as any.<br /><br />The song \\"Someone You'd Admire\\" has lyricsthat are very contemplative. It is a simple tune with just Pecknold's vocals and a guitar. It is nice to see that in the midst of an album which focused a bit more on complexity that Fleet Foxes are still able to demonstrate simplicity which in turn makes the album more emotionally impacting.<br /><br />\\"The Shrine/An Argument\\" is two distinct songs in one and is the album's longest track. The first half starts off like it was taken directly from a Simon & Garfunkel album and leads into a more percussive section. The second half mellows down as far as percussion goes but introduces an interesting section where a lot of the aforementioned instrumentation of the album is present.<br /><br />Fleet Foxes are not the type of band that will initially blow you away. Rather, their music has to be chipped away layer by layer before you feel like you have a grasp on it, which is a great thing for an album's longevity. From that standpoint, their music takes effort to enjoy. It has depth and cannot be taken at face value. While \\"Helplessness Blues\\" doesn't initially stand out as a classic album I think it has the potential to grow into an album that will stand the test of time and ultimately end up on a lot of \\"Best of 2011\\" lists.vocals and a guitar.

0439023521|5.0|This book had me riveted from the beginning.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a story rife with drama, love, and fear. Katniss Everdeen is her family's sole provider. She lives in North America, in some kind of dystopian future. There are 12 districts, each known for producing some kind of product, and each is cut off from the rest. They all defer to the Capitol. In the past, there was a huge war and uprising against the Capitol, resulting in the complete destruction of a 13th District. To remind the people of Panem (what they call their world) of the atrocities their ancestors committed, each district must send one girl and one boy to compete in the deadliest battle: The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Katniss is all about protecting her family, so when her sister's name gets called as the female tribute from District 12, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place. Later, she realizes that the male tribute is a boy who nearly saved her life by risking to give her some bread when she and her family were starving. She owes him, and she doesn't want to have to owe ANYONE in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a fight to the death. The last person standing returns to their district as a hero. They are given wealth and food for the rest of their lives. They just have to kill (or sit by while others kill) all of the other tributes. It's a bloodbath.<br /><br />The worst part is that the people in the Capitol find this game so entertaining. They make bets on the tributes, they can send them gifts. They watch the whole thing play out on TV like some twisted game of Survivor. And all the while, we are rooting for Katniss to win.<br /><br />My favorite character is Peeta, the boy tribute from Katniss' district. He is funny, charming, and sweet. It seems impossible that Katniss or he will have to die for the book to end. The whole story was a rollercoaster of craziness, right from beginning to end.
1563894696|5.0|This comic rocked! This was my first comic that I have ever owned. The first one I had ever read was a collection of the first Spiderman comics, but they weren't as good as this. I have heard some comic people talkings about alternate universes and story lines. I'm not sure if this is one of those because this is an actual book that loses one of the main characters, but for what it is it is a very good comic. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say I never expected that person to be the killer. Talk about a shocking ending! Also, this made me want to go out and buy a .22 handgun! That's how they get us! Haha. Very interesting and fun comic.    5/5    John McAdam:  Were Ancient Gods From Other Planets?  Am I Mad or Coherent?  The Surgeon With Glasses  Confucius Say
B001DF68MA|4.0|My wife and I purchased this to take our 2 year old daughter cycling with us. We installed this on my wife's Mongoose mountain bike, and she loves that our daughter is able to see everything and is safely tucked between her arms. The reason we rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is the change it made to her riding - it requires a slightly wider stride with the legs; otherwise, there is no difference.    We were skeptical at first appearance that our daughter would fit into this seat; she is 28 months old and weighs 27 lbs but is unusually tall for her age. The back of the seat is not intended to fully support the child's back like a car seat though, as the bike rider will be able to do that. However she fits into it just fine and we will probably be able to enjoy it throughout this year at least.    In all, we highly recommend this seat for anyone wanting to enjoy the outdoors with their children.

They DO ISOLATE SOUND  3. the 7.1 under windows 7 works MOST of the time. However (say in portal 2) some sounds are only coming from the \\"right surround\\" like GlaDOS  4. THe battery life sucks  5. There is deinite \\"noise\\" in the background. Sound slike S/N ratio is like 70%!!!!  6. PLUGGING DIRECTLY INTO THE MOTHERBOARD with the USB transmiter is MUCH better to decease noise (tip on Logitech forum)  6. NO EASY way to switch from say ATI HDMI 7.1 audio (or even build in audio) to these. Must write your own script, pay for shareware, or do it manually. Pain you can't just hit a switch on the keyboard  8. No \\"charging base station\\" for ease\\"    Overall, despite these complaints, the \\"like mint\\" from Amazon PRim Warehouse made it all worth it. They work, provide at times STUNNING surround (dead space was great) and other times just \\"ok\\" (Portal 2).    I Bet the next version will be better.

0756404738|4.0|I'm seriously hoping the third book will make some of the seemingly dragging and disheartening parts of this book pay off. I don't want to spoil anything but sometimes less is more.<br /><br />I read another review where someone said this books seemed like numerous separate stories. I couldn't agree more! A couple of which, seemed like they went on FOREVER! I didn't particularly like one portion at all (the Adem) although I understand this explains how he learned some necessary skills (and apparently forgot others).<br /><br />However, that being said...I wrote in my review of BOOK ONE that as soon as I finished that book I gave it to my teenage daughter and told her she HAD to read it--it was THAT good, but it's a good thing she didn't because after reading book two now I've changed my mind. It's a good book but book two is not for teenagers, in my opinion, and that kind of rules out book one then no matter how innocent it was.<br /><br />*SPOILERS* For instance, one of the main themes in this second book is sex, and I don't mean it's a love story, THIS is a story to rival the life cycle of rabbits; minus the babies though. Hey, I can understand a coming of age book but this is a bit overboard. Consequences to sex are nil and have been neatly overcome...no babies, no diseases, etc...an adolescent fantasy.<br /><br />The Adem are so busy getting it on with everyone else (and their brother...and sister) that they don't even KNOW that you actually have to have sex to have a baby. They think it \\"just happens\\" when the time is right. I can only imagine that it's because none of them has ever been without it that they don't know that the one thing leads to the other. I thought this part was extremely annoying. I can only assume that the author is playing with ethics; vice and virtue...mixing them up: mala in se vs. mala prohibita. While I can still appreciate what he may be trying to do, it was still annoying to me.<br /><br />Also, as a woman and the mother of three daughters I take issue with the message that it is apparently \\"understandable\\" that Denna is willing to be beaten consistently by her cruel patron simply to \\"get what she wants\\" (although there may be alternative ways to get it) and the comparison to Kvothe's whippings at the University. There IS NO comparison. I take offense to the treatment of the issue of her abuse up to this point.<br />Kvothe's punishments, although sometimes unjustly applied, are foreordained punishments which are not at the whim of a single individual. Denna's cruel patron could beat her to DEATH at his leisure, if he so chose. The University has rules, punishments, and a governing body which has to vote on them before they can be carried out.<br />*END OF SPOILERS*<br /><br />Still, the main story is captivating, not AS captivating as book one, but still captivating. I'm only hoping that what SEEM like mistakes, in my opinion, (or should we call them hang-ups?) in this portion of the series was calculated by the author. I HOPE there's a method to the author's seeming \\"madness\\" because if NOT it would be a bit of a shame. IF some of the most annoying issues (to me) were meant to be a study in contrasts, ok, but I don't see how they helped to drive the plot at all. Like I said, the story is very very good...but I'd hate to see these seeming incongruities NOT rectify themselves in the end.<br /><br />The overall story, so far, is good enough to overcome even these though, I believe, but I would like to know the reason why the author seems to be 'beating' certain 'drums' so to speak: Is it part of the story? Or a personal hang-up of the author? This remains to be seen.<br /><br />At this point I'm trying to keep an open mind. It seemed to me that the author had cultivated a very likeable story around some very likeable characters only to sully both a bit by the end of this book, especially the main character! If this was calculated it was a HUGE risk for the author to end there until book three! Igotta' take my hat off to him for having the guts to do it...however, if it wasn't calculated...it may have been a huge mistake. I keep keeping in mind that Kvothe IS still only sixteen!! So I have FAITH in the author of the FIRST BOOK to pull it all together and blow our minds again with book three.<br /><br />I honestly KNOW he's capable of it...book one proves this. He just needs to keep the themes from getting too cerebral and too bogged down with making ethical stands or statements and just TELL THE DANG STORY!!<br /><br />Maybe I read too much into it but I don't think so.ver, if it wasn't calculated...it may have been a huge mistake.

The sonic sound is just a beep each time you push the button. After three weeks the push button has failed. You must wiggle it side to side to make it work. Batteries were checked and found to be fully charged at 1.5 vdc each. I've had christmas cards that sing louder. As a show piece that sits on the shelf...  it doesn't measure up either. The plastic case has stamped impressions that would need to be (painted) detailed to allow it to be properly displayed. The secret writing ink did work and the blue light did allow the ink to be visible. A fun fact for the kids, but that didn't last long.

291193976X|5.0|...for a more equitable society. I recently had the father of a French friend, who was on his first visit to the United States, over for dinner. Instead of the customary bottle of wine, he brought three French books as \\"petits cadeaux,\\" this being one of them. He said it is a \\"best seller\\" in France. Indeed, it is, currently ranking #3 at Amazon.fr, with 231 reviews. Yet it is only a very thin pamphlet, which can be read in under an hour.<br /><br />Stephane Hessel, at the age of 93, and as he says, the \\"end is not far,\\" is still fighting the good fight. His \\"credentials\\" for such a fight are impeccable. He fought in the French Resistance during World War II, parachuting into France before D-Day. He was captured and tortured by the Nazis, deported to Buchenwald, and was within one day of being executed. After the end of the war, he played a key role in drafting the Declaration of the Universal Rights of Man for the United Nations, which was adopted in 1948. (As he says, he insisted on the word \\"universal,\\" as opposed to his Anglo-Saxon colleagues, who wanted to use the word \\"international.\\") Most importantly, he reminds the French in particular of the \\"social compact\\" that was adopted upon the Liberation, in which the resources available would be utilized to meet the fundamental needs of all of society's members, including the less fortunate. He readily denounces the attitude of the few at the top today, who \\"always need more...\\" and who will now claim that we cannot afford to take care of the less fortunate. How can this be, he asks, when in war-devastated France, we adopted the attitude that we could? For a much more in-depth look at this period, I would highly recommend Serge Halimi's [[ASIN:2869595034 Quand la gauche essayait]].<br /><br />Hessel was born in Berlin in 1917, the son of a Jewish writer and a mother who was a painter. They emigrated to France in 1924. In addition to the changed social compact within France, Hessel is equally indignant towards Israeli action against the Palestinians, in particular, Operation Cast Lead, the attack on Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip, \\"an open-air prison.\\"<br /><br />Towards the various injustices in the world today, Hessel says that indifference is the worst attitude. The first step towards change is the indignation that is required not to accept the status quo, particularly as is promoted by the main stream media which is owned by the very rich.  From indignation, he advocates peaceful revolt, and cites examples, like South Africa, where that worked.<br /><br />I looked at the various 1-star reviews at Amazon.fr, and they range from those who say that this is \\"much ado about nothing,\\" that is, this pamphlet is far too short and simplistic (and indeed, in many ways, that is a valid criticism) to those who are still enthralled with the \\"magic of the marketplace,\\" despite the economic collapse of 2008, which necessitated a massive bailout of the rich. The biggest question remains though:  Why in France, and in many parts of the Arab world, is there this strong \\"indignation\\" with the injustices perpetrated by the ruling class, but in the United States, the distractions of, for example, of Presidential birth certificates, and professional sports, still are able to prevent the many who have been injured in order that the rich live exceedingly well, from focusing on those issues?<br /><br />Thomas Paine accomplished much with simple and straightforward pamphlets. Hopefully Hessel's will do more than `stir the pot.\\"<br /><br />Enough though, or this review will be longer than Hessel's work.

1439102724|4.0|Sing You Home is about SO many different things. Picoult takes on a lot in this novel and I was pleasantly surprised to find that she really pulls it off. The novel is about divorce, infidelity, gay rights, fundamentalist Christians, but mostly it is a novel about love and family. It is a novel about the true meaning of family, about the fact that family comes in many shapes and sizes and that everyone deserves a chance to have that family he/she dreams of.    I am usually a fan of Jodi Picoult's books, but in recent years I've been underwhelmed with some of what she's put out there. Not so for Sing You Home. I was extremely satisfied and happy with what she did with the novel, I can safely recommend the book and she is back in my good graces.  What I liked best about the book was the character development. With over 400 pages, the reader really gets the opportunity to sink into the book and get to know the characters so it's a good thing Picoult creates such believable, interesting characters. Everyone in the book felt real to me and while I didn't particularly like all of them, each one of them added a crucial element to the story.    While Sing You Home has the typical courtroom drama aspect to it that all of Picoult's books seem to have, in this case I found it to be a small part of the book and fit in perfectly with everything else.    The pacing of this book was absolutely fantastic. I was fully immersed in the story after the first couple of chapters, and once I was about halfway through I could not put it down. Literally - I think I read the entire last half in one Sunday afternoon (something I typically don't do). And the ending worked very well for me.    Overall, I would say that Sing You Home is one of Jodi Picoult's better novels. I would definitely recommend it, whether you're a fan of hers or not.

Over all, the movie was amazing.

B000MM0L2S|4.0|This compact disc is entitled \\"We All Love Ennio Morricone\\" who is a productive and prolific composer and musician. Apart from the list of contributors like Celine Dion, Renee Fleming, Bruce Springsteen, Quincy Jones, Metallica, Yo-Yo Ma, Herbie Hancock, and many others on this seventy minutes of music, we get a variety of sounds and voices at times. Ennio Morricone was finally awarded an honorary Academy Award a couple of years ago. It was well-deserved for his contributions to original scores over 500 in films over his movie career.    My only complaint with this compact disc is that it doesn't explain why he is so well-loved by the people who sing and contributed to the compilation. Not even an explanation as to why he is loved in the arts industry, it would have been helpful to have understood his brilliance in music and why is so highly regarded even though his name may not be as famous as his peers.    Apart from that exception, I enjoyed listening to the sounds, voices, and the music of Ennio Morricone who would not have made it possible.
0316069353|4.0|First, disregard the one star \\"reviews\\" as they are really Kindle price complaints. I've been waiting for a long time for a new Connelly thriller. I was initially confused by the Haller domestic problems, but as the case progressed, I was drawn into the story in spite of myself. By the time I was halfway through, I was hooked and curled up in the courtroom with Mickey. Sometimes, after a year or two, we forget the back story so it takes bit of time to return to the narrative groove...once there, it's the old Haller, and he is right on the money! As a Harry Bosch fan, there is a quantum difference between a new Bosch and a new Haller. Sometimes I wish we could get one new Bosch a year from Connelly without the distraction of producing a new Haller as well.

Read the reviews and thought - Oh well, it's a series, the price is right I'll give it a go.    Here in Australia we don't get a lot of the series you do in the US - I mean we were lucky to get Dexter from what I heard.     So I put in on in the morning while having breakfast on a day off. The missus comes in, says \\"I don't want to watch this cr*p in the morning\\"  Well she was still sitting there toward the end of the first episode saying are they finishing it there? I want to see the rest of it!    So it even hooks the none genre people as well.    Personally, it's got enough slice and dice / story line to keep you interested and the character actors get you interested in the storyline. It's even got a few funnies thrown in    I really hope they make another series - 6 episodes was way too short!    If you like apocalypse, end of word, horror movies - you can't go past this.

This is an amazing vegetarian resource which you can use to prepare accompaniments to the food which comes off the grill- AND there are grilling recipes in here.

The recipes are based on the author's weekly column in the Guardian weekend magazine called the New Vegetarian, and just looking at them makes me hungry: Caramelized garlic tart, globe artichokes with crushed broad beans, chard and saffron omelettes, soba noodles with aubergine and mango, black pepper tofu. It goes on and on, and none are too difficult to make. The photography by Jonathan Lovekin (who has done Nigel Slater's beautiful books) is also so very inviting. Vegetarians looking to add great recipes to their repertoire, Plenty, and Yotam's column at the Guardian are fantastic resources.

B00471W42A|5.0|I assume it is normal for a show to drop in ratings after it gets canceled.  I also know that the type of people who enjoy this show know how to get it without paying for it (or having their views counted...)  I did really enjoy this season and will miss it.  That being said, hoping for a movie, but I know it's not likely.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Its shortish, but its a cell phone game that i had a blast playing which says a lot. Even got a bunch of my friends to buy it. Its totally worth the 2 bucks.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|My wife and I actually enjoyed this movie.  Nothing over the top, and pretty decent acting.  Special effects fit the bill and the doggie was adorable.  Kid friendly and not a lot of nasty language or sex.
0679805273|5.0|I got this book for a college graduate and then went on too have all his friends and teachers sign it and he loved it!
B004Q1FDHO|4.0|It was the free app of the day so I figured it couldn't hurt to check it out.  The concept is simple enough to get started right away but if there were other challenges built into the game, I'd give it 5 stars.  This game is a pretty fun time waster.
0385732554|5.0|Awesome utopian literature. Shows how you can not control every aspect of humanity. Awesome to take something everyone has and take it away to give it two only person.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|This movie was well done and acted. It had me trying to figure out why the female lead paid for all of the male lead's hotel and other items, which was explained very near the end. I like movies where you can't guess the ending.
B0010X745K|5.0|I've used this company many times before and the product is always in the condition they say it's in. I've never had any problems with the company, as a matter of fact I usually get my product before hand and I like that because I am disable and order a lot of movies since thats all I can do, so THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, they help keep me going, and you do have a customer who care and don't complain. so thanks for the great job.

B004GHNHVW|5.0|Have been a Paul Simon fan since I was 12 years old (33 years now). This album, like all PS albums takes a while to get in to, you need about 6 - 10 listens before the songs start to develop their own identity but once you do, its well worth it. The lyrics as always with Paul Simon are great, some very clever ones on this album. At first listen there seems to be a religious undertone to a lot of the songs but I think its more a man reaching his latter years in life and thinking about whats next, he has said in the past he isnt religious. The best songs on the album are Afterlife (gets stuck in your head after a while, fill in a form etc, you'll know what i mean when you listen to it), Dazzling blue, Love and hard times and the title track, which has a rift not a million miles away from Mrs Robinson. Also, Love Is Eternal Sacred Light is a great song, even a tad hip if i do say so myself. The songs are typical Paul Simon of the last 25 years. There are bits of the usual African influence, also Cajun and other world music but its the songs always get you in the end with PS. This is like side two of Surprise really, so if you liked that, this is an extension. As with all albums since Graceland, i dont think he'll reel in any new fans but for existing fans, its a treat to have a new album from , for me, America's greatest singer/songwriter of the last 50 years
B0042RUMH8|2.0|I'm sure we will see people in large volumes shouting that this is a great album. However, I find that the dance hall beats becoming a little too much after a while. Jennifer has a lot more skill in her voice and should have exhibited that during this project. It's been a while since we have heard from her and a phoenix project like this should have been \\"baked\\" a little more. The best attempt of stepping outside of the dance-hall beat was the song \\"Run the World\\"; which may have a chance at some serious play across multiple genres of radio stations. The rest of the album may find Jennifer pigeon holed into limited radio channels. If the goal was to stay upbeat, then she has achieved it. However, this project doesn't provide the breath of skill this lovely lady brings to the table. I am so looking forward to the next project. Hopefully, the next will have 3-4 ballads, a couple with some R&B beats with a little Latin flavor, maybe a couple of dance hall and a couple of Pop hits. I know this sounds like a rainbow of genres, but she can do this. She has the finesse to be successful in all of these. Forever, a fan.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Well, the Oscars have come and gone, so we all know by now the four awards that went to this powerful production, and for my money I was certainly sure that Rush and Bonham-Carter deserved statuettes as well. As others have stated already, the acting and emotion of all are beyond compare. Firth inhabits this shy, frustrated prince/king with the same depth as his George Falconer (A Single Man) for which he also should have won a year earlier. Every single actor, from Firth to Eve Best to little stuttering Willy delivers a top notch performance-I will not list them all as others have already done so expertly and accurately. The ONLY recommendation I will make, beyond get this movie Yesterday, of course, is that you get the ORIGINAL R-rated VERSION released in the theatres. Weinstein studios felt compelled to re-release in the US a PG version that deleted or edited language in the scene where Firth, as Bertie, breaks through his stammering with a string of swear words that include (shock) the F-word.  The scene lasts about 14 seconds, and is used to demonstrate his breaking through with fluent speech. It is in context and not gratuitous at all, and represents a turning point for him in Logue's studio. In England, 12 year olds could see the film unaccompanied, with an A rating. Dealing as we are, however, with the idiosyncracies of a film rating and censorship system here that fails to see life is art really, just make sure you get the historically accurate R version. There is no way that the Duke of York would have uttered a string of Disney-esque verbiage. Hooper, Firth and Rush did not support the reworking, and it wasn't necessary, by golly gee willikers! So, get the damn authentic Oscar winning version, and send the under 17 year olds out of the room for those 14 seconds so they don't hear those words that they have never heard before.
074356619X|5.0|This is one of the best audio books I've ever listened to as far as self help. It has helped me tremendously in my everyday life as far as happiness, money, self esteem. You have to listen (or read) this book many times to catch on, and you have to believe in it, and once you get it...watch out, your life will be totally differant. The one review that said just believe in JC, well duh, if you listen closly to this book, thats some of the points this book makes. The reviewers that put this book down are people that want instant gratification, and don't want to work at it.(law of attraction) All I can say is that this book has changed my life so much for the better! I can't thank Rhonda enough!!
030746363X|5.0|I highly recommend to anyone looking to make drastic changes to your life. A good read, he is very entertaining in the way he speaks so you don't get bored  from all of the scientific facts.
B000Q66JXA|4.0|I saw this movie many years ago.  After watching Game of Thrones and Camelot, I wanted to see it again.  Good video to round out your collection.  Loved Merlin and Morgana.
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book my not have received 5 stars if not for the fact that it was exactly what I needed at exactly the right time.  Do the Work is an excellent kick in the pants for anyone beginning any new project.  Although it especially focuses on writing, there are some very inspring words of advice for everyone about battling forces of our own creation: doubt, fear, reluctance, procrastination.  I love the metaphor of the dragon and the knight.  As a teacher, I plan to share the advice in this book with my students.
B002RKRTGO|3.0|All indented quotes are missing. This includes the multiple-page origin of the hound and the obituary that provides important details.
1444710338|5.0|This is one of the best books to loose weight. I tried so many diets but this one makes me feel and look good. I did not loose just 3 lb but I am still in phase 2 because I did not walk at all and I ate fruits. Try it for yourself. You cannot go wrong with it. I will highly recommend it.
B000GH2YPG|4.0|Rebecca is a great example of excellent and timeless writing.  Daphne du Maurier's story is suspenseful with plenty of well-thought out characters who give us a look into the life of the old English elite.  How does a young bride find her place at the Manderley mansion as the second Mrs. de Winter?  We watch as she stumbles through her early weeks at Manderley and tries to acquire Rebecca's grace, please her husband, and earn the respect of the household staff and Maxim's friends and family.  All the while staying far away from the menacing Mrs. Danvers.  The plot develops into an exciting twist of events that keep you reading enthusiastically straight to the finish.<br /><br />Mr. and Mrs. de Winter are very busy and keep to an active schedule, but it is all leisure.  I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the lavish tea-times.  How funny to think of people living this way!
B000G6R7B8|5.0|This is a good looking watch. Keeps time accurately (for a auto winding watch). Loses a few seconds a day. That is to be expected. The dial is unique looking. I get a lot of complements on it. The band is canvas and cleans up quickly at the kitchen sink. Just don't wait until it is completely grubby before cleaning. I take some dish sope and a old tooth brush to it every couple of weeks.
B0018M6J90|4.0|We found the movie to be entertaining, but we also really liked the tight \\"big band sound\\" of the soundtrack.  So much so, that I went looking for it.  I found it here: [[ASIN:B0012X6FXK Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]]
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I received this watch as a gift (ordered through Amazon) in January, and it has now worked its way into my rotation as I now wear it about 4 days a week.  The first thing I did was replace the factory rubber strap with a 22mm zulu strap, which I find to be the most comfortable strap of any watch I own.  I've also recently ordered a President style bracelet in order to \\"dress it up\\" a bit for work.  There are many strap and bracelet options that can drastically change the look and feel of this watch so I consider it very versatile.      I have noticed this watch will pick up some time over a couple weeks (maybe 2 minutes or so), but I consider that accurate enough for my purposes.  It's even less of a big deal since I will occasionally let the watch run down on accident if I don't wear it for a couple days, meaning I have to reset the time anyway.  The lume on the dial is serviceable and allows me to read the time in a dark room when I wake up after 6-8 hours of sleep.  I don't think it is as bright as everyone else makes it out to be since I notice it dims significantly after the first hour out of light.  It does have enough left at the end of the night to be readable, so I see it as living up to the task.  The rotating bezel is very precise and more useful than I ever thought it would be.  I now use it daily in any instance where I might need an hour or less timer, such as to time my parking at meters and garages, how long I've been out of the office for lunch, or even around the house (cooking pasta for dinner, etc).    Generally speaking, this is a very handsome watch that dresses up well with the right bracelet and is right at home in a casual setting as well.  I will generally remove any \\"nice\\" watch I own if I'm performing any sort of laborious tasks, but I have performed some minor auto repairs without removing the Seiko and have yet to scratch the face or the casing after smacking it around a bit.  I consider it very durable for daily wear and moderate physical use.  I am fairly value minded but like nice things, but I will find myself hard pressed to buy a \\"high end\\" diver watch such as a Rolex or Omega as long as there is a quality offering such as the Seiko in the sub-$200 range that suits my needs just fine.  There is also a huge mod market for the SKX007 where you can find infinite options for crystal, dial style/colors, hand styles, bracelets, case finishes, etc, and end up with a very high quality watch for less than $300.
B004VD3PE0|5.0|I'm finding it hard to say much about this book without giving too much away.  But I want to be able to rate it, so here's my amazing review.  This is a beautiful and touching book.  It kept me emotionally involved from start to finish.  One complaint though...I found the constant talk about \\"punk\\" to be a little over the top.  People aren't like that in real life.  But that's just a minor quibble.  Great book!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Whether or not you've seen the show or read the book, this is magical and complete!!  In this case the 'songs' tell the whole story, the performances are magnificent, and the appearance of the 'originals' is a treat.  I saw \\"Les Mis\\" in London during the second season, and thought I'd miss the sets (I didn't).  I did miss the 'scope' (no TV can match a stage), but otherwise, I was entirely 'hooked'.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|The official Twitter app is by far the worst app out there. It's buggy,  force closes, and in the 3 months I used it I never could get notifications to work.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I won't comment on the troubles some have had with installation others than to say I have had no such issues in nine months of use, including several updates.<br /><br />But to downgrade a program because of difficulties in installation when it's an awesome program in use strikes me as relatively immature.<br /><br />This program is great. It works perfectly on my Evo, replicating the abilities of Microsoft office to an amazing degree. Perhaps its greatest strength is its ability to sync in a variety of ways with your other computers. Most impressive and useful to my mind is its ability to sync with Google Docs, an ability I use frequently which arrived via upgrade several months ago.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This is a wonderful buy for a great show that was on in the 1990's. I was very glad I got this. Amazon had it cheap enough that I could get it. I have checked everywhere and all wanted so much higher because it is a hard to come by. This includes from the first show all that way to the tie up movies that they made at the end.
B004IQMXD4|3.0|I was amazed at how beautiful the lyrics were for most of these songs. Stevie's voice sounds amazing, especially for a woman in her 60s.     However, I'm not a fan of most of Dave Stewart's production choices. The cd seems overproduced instead of just allowing Stevie to flow through these songs with her much-improved voice.      I found myself wondering how Sheryl Crow or any of the producers of 'Trouble in Shangrila' would've handled some of these songs. My honest opinion is that they would've done a much better job.    Stevie did her part - the songs and the voice are first rate.
B004SBX112|3.0|I can no longer open this app. screen goes black and then right back to my home screen. anyone else?
B003L20IFQ|5.0|This movie was fantastic for its feeling of realism and its simplicity.  Ryan Reynolds did a wonderful job.  I was so drawn into this movie that there was never a moment where I really felt like I was watching a movie.  Some reviewers have complained about this movie because there were no scenes outside the wooden box Reynolds was trapped in.  That is exactly why this movie stood out to me.  Sometimes the simplest ideas have the most impact and I believe that the director and Reynolds did an excellent job.  This movie was reminiscent of the first [[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Saw]] movie with that simplicity as well as the feeling of dread and solitude.      I would recommend this movie to anyone for impact alone.  Buried gave insight into how our world seems to work today and it is a bit disheartening.  Make sure that you watch a happy movie after this one though.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|i love britney spears! she is so talented and idk why people always say shes coming back...cuz she never went anywhere. she is always on top. there is only one song that i dont really like all that much but its deffenitly a fun cd and my friends all say they love it!
B000BKDOB6|5.0|Got this for my 19 year old nephew. I wanted to introduce him to some classic music and he likes it. One of my favorite Albums of all time.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|why can't I play the May 2011 chapter!! someone please help! give me may... you get more stars. graphics are good tho
B004IQMXD4|2.0|This album was marketed as her best work since the 80's.  I remember her music in the 80's and much of it was rockin', but this album is primarily ballads and a few very mellow, but more up-tempo songs.  If you prefer the mellow, then this album is for you.  If you're looking for something reminiscent of the 80's, this is not it.  Stevie sounds great and the album is pretty to look at, but not my cup of tea.  I'm disappointed that this album isn't more 'alive'.
0062004352|5.0|Excellent start in this series! Very entertaining, LOVE her writing style. I wish there were more than just 3 in the series!!
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This evening Josh Fox was live and in person in a very small venue in Erie, PA. The well documented irrefutable impact that is occuring in our local environment is more than a red flag. Our land and our water is in irreversable danger. Here, in Pennylvania, we are at a breaking point. We do not have the support of our impoverished citizens. They, as well as their local municipalites are starving and numb to the factual dangers clearly illustrated in the \\"Gasland\\" documentary.  What are we to do?  There are going to be approximately 220,000 wells drilled in our State if we don't act.  Josh Fox stated that the difference between this and the other denied fact of Global Warming is that we may able to stop this.  Pennsylvania is a glorious wildlife state with rivers and streams and mountains. Please educate yourselves as to what is at stake and give this documentary an earnest chance.
1439177783|5.0|As someone who feels like I have been fighting battles against my own body for years, I really connected with Portia's story. Even as someone who has not had an eating disorder, while reading her stories I could see echoes of my own behavior, I could relate to those moments  where you see your body as imperfect and struggle against regaining control over your own body.     Her story is a brutally honest. I can see how some people see this as a \\"manual\\" but I really do not see it in that manner. It did make me feel more sane, it was a revelation to understand that someone else has thought these horrible things about their own body. At the same time, it is a message of hope, that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, that it is possible to make peace with yourself.     I really appreciated her sharing her story and her pain.
B004GHNHVW|4.0|I've had the CD for about two weeks and really enjoy it.  I'm not going to jump into the \\"it's the best since_____ wagon\\" but it really is a good CD!  Paul's lyrics are great and the music is very loose, relaxed with some very interesting instrumentation.  Any Paul Simon fan will not be disappointed (except for the length - only 38 mins).    The difference in price was not significant, so I sprung for the deluxe version.  I was hoping the DVD was worthwhile, but it totals about 20 minutes and some of that is only audio.  I wonder why they went through all the trouble of setting up cameras and recording, only to release such a small amount?
0439813786|5.0|I love this book! It is thick with lots of pictures and is a mix between action, fantasy, and mystery with a little bit of drama.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|It wasn't Stephen King and Richard Bachman  It is Stephen King AS Richard Bachman  the \\"two\\" are one and the same
B000B5KQY4|3.0|CD was somewhat of a let-down, particularly for the song I was seeking, \\"Moments in Love\\"  This version of that song was different than other (better) versions I have heard.  It's now filed in the back of my CD collection - more for nostaligia's sake.  Jaxnative
B004WMKSH2|4.0|I've never read the books and have enjoyed the films.<br /><br />Now this time I used my Amazon Prime account and downloaded this film.  If I had to pay I would have been very disappointed in the quality and resolution of the display.  It took me less than an hour to download via UNBox and I could have endure a full hour or a bit more without impacting my connection (Comcast internet only, I use over the air Antennae for TV and what I can find online).  The beginning of the film was severely pixelated and then became blotchy about a quarter of the way through.  I believe my eyes got used to it and it was less of an issue or there was some streaming going on and my buffer caught up, not sure exactly how UNBox works.<br /><br />I do not recommend downloading HD films.  Netflix and Hulu stream much better pictures currently there's no reason Amazon couldn't stand a little bump in the file size to get a better experience out of this method.  It's just under ~3 Gb so for broadband a couple more gigs ain't gonna kill anyone.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe is simply the best show on TV right now.  I'm an over-65 retired female, not exactly the demographic that a show like Fringe is playing to, but I like my shows complex, dramatic -- yes, even some sci-fi -- a little wacky, and a huge part intelligent writing and excellent acting.  Abrams and his crew of talented writers and producers have done it again, Lost being another of a line of winning series (anyone missing Felicity would be well-advised to take a look at one woman's four years in college).      Fringe has continued to entertain, amuse, shock and totally take viewers on a roller coaster ride from one week to the next, and each season is better than the last.  John Noble is so excellent as the absolutely diabolical but lovable mad scientist Walter that I can't for the life of me understand why Emmy Awards haven't been thrust at him every year.  Anna Torv is that rare female actress who appeals equally to men and women, and quite possibly the only female lead on television who dresses appropriately for her job as an FBI agent.  Her Olivia is a polished jewel, both beautiful and smart!  Joshua Jackson was such a surprise to me because I didn't expect him to be up to the caliber of his castmates, but I was so wrong -- he is brilliant as the super-smart once bad boy Peter.  The threesome is surrounded by interesting and quirky characters to fill out the ensemble, especially Lance Reddick as the head of the FBI's Fringe Division, and Jasika Nicole as the utterly delightful Agent and Walter-sitter Astrid, whose name he never seems to remember correctly but always speaks with adoring admiration.     If you haven't watched Fringe yet, I recommend watching it from the very beginning. There has been a long, enjoyable and steady build-up from the first episodes of Season 1 to where we are now at the end of Season 3, and I promise you will enjoy the ride!
B004V7EXO2|4.0|I have listened to this a dozen times and love it.  It isn't Paul Simon's best work ever (I am partial to his older stuff, including Graceland & his Simon & Garfunkel days), but I do still really like it.  The lyrics are beautiful and the melodies contagious.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|Skinny box with 3 blu-ray discs and an amazing picture! Seriously, you wont belieble how beautiful is each frame. It´s truly HIGH DEFINITION.    A bad thing: no subtitles in extra contents!
0756404738|5.0|Worth every moment of the wait! I loved every moment and I am really looking forward to the next book.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I have to really praise this album, although I have a personal preference for the sophomore ROOM ON FIRE album, IS THIS IT? is a brilliant summer, autumn and spring listening. The tracks with rare exception are all very likeable (and easy to play on the guitar) It is nearly impossible not to take the album as it is and listen for the sake of it.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Very good product with a very good price. Unfortunately the aspecto radio ain´t the same as the tv screen, wich means that you'll see those bad black bars up and down.

078062999X|1.0|I've been forced to track this down for my thesis - not only was that near impossible the movie was rather large (at around 4 hours I think). I thought the 1990 version was slightly better and even that sucked. All I can say about this movie is that it is good to look at. I think it is an egotiscal piece at best however faithful to the text it is.
B000PC6A3E|3.0|Stunning image quality but the box is very poor! the blue box is full of holes! I didn´t understand the reason! I never saw a blu-ray with a box like that. Veeeery weird!

1606863622|5.0|This is one of my favorite books I have read. This book is a love story between two people, John Tyree and Savannah Lynn Curtis. This book has many moods and emotions. It is a very interesting book. It took place in North Carolina. John is in the army. When he came home from Germany for two weeks, he met Savannah. While on leave, Savannah and John fell desperately in love. Nicholas Sparks is one of the world's best authors. Not every romance results in a happy ending.<br /><br />Description and summary of main points<br />  John is in the army. When he comes home he stays with his father in North Carolina. Savannah is spending the month at the seashore in North Carolina with some of her college friends. She has to go back to finish her schooling. Savannah and John fell in love when they first glanced at each other. John's father has a disease. He gets sick in the end of the book. Sometimes he forgets things. Nicholas Sparks is one of the best authors.<br /><br />Evaluation<br />  Overall, I think this was one of the best books I have ever read. I really liked it. I have read it so many times and it never gets old or boring. This is a very good lesson for people. It shows how complicated and hard relationships can be. Also, how easy it is to fall in love.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />  In conclusion, I thought this book was great. It taught a good lesson. It showed how complicated life can be at times. It also showed how complicated relationships can be. I loved this book. It didn't have any boring parts in it. I was interested in the whole book.<br /><br />Your final review<br />  My final review about this book is it is a good lesson for people to learn about life. Life can be hard sometimes, but you have to follow your heart and do what is right. Some parts in the book were better than others. But it was still an interesting book to read. I think everyone should read this book. This is one of my favorite books. I loved it!

I can't help but wonder if I'm going to get another one soon).  The pack itself is simple-a miderately sized back pack which has a number of velcroed in dividers.  It holds a camera and a ton of gear, or two cameras and somewhat less gear.  Most importantly (to me), it has a set of straps on the side to hold a tripod.  Awesome!  Would definitely get again.

0316044695|5.0|Just wanted to point out that the criticism of the author including his personal beliefs into HIS story is bordering on stupidity. This is the account of the ACTUAL MAN ON THE GROUND.....THE LONE SURVIVOR....and how HE viewed what happened. You can argue that the ROE have their place but to argue that he doesn't have the right to express his view against some parts of them in certain instances is ridiculous. This is the same type of attitude that has our President prosecuting heroes for giving known terrorists a fat-lip after capture. I think the main issue the crtics have is that you have a true hero here laying out the real deal facts and it goes against their own liberal beliefs.....SO clearly you have to attack and silence the guy proving you wrong. A few go as far as to hint that Marcus is lying!!! You want to talk about arrogance? That is some of the most arrogant stuff I have read.  The reason they can't believe it is because they can't possibly imagine someone being so selfless and heroic as they don't have a drop of that inside them.  If you don't like it then don't read it and write about the mission or military from your own perspective. Good luck getting a book titled: Operation Redwing: The Real Account from an Unemployed Blogger Sitting at a Computer in his Mother's Basement!!! I encourage you to voice your opinion and see who is interested.....clearly a few people wanted to hear what happened from Marcus' side of things....I doubt you have as much luck.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|One star because George will not release the original theatrical version. Complete crap. Don't want CGI \\"enhancements\\" and changes that make the original trilogy more like the prequel trilogy (i.e. more terrible).
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This album is simply amazing!  To me these songs express healing from relationships, loving yourself, not settling, welcoming new loves or fresh starts and sooooo much more!  She hit the jack pot with this cd--so many people can identify with the words of these songs.  Adele is an exceptional artist!
0316069353|5.0|I have a serious complaint reg. the last book of Michael Connelly, the fifth witness.  First of all, it is impossible to put aside, so my whole schedule was a chaos (again) until the moment I finished the book. But then, and this is not the first time, near the last pages I became again very sad. Having to say goodbye to some very good friends. Mickey Haller, Cisco, the others whom I have become to know so well.  Better in certain ways then a lot of people, including their unique strengths but also weaknesses, the fifth witness is again more than just a brilliantly written book. It creates the characters to become so much alive that it is hard to so goodbye and so I have this serious complaint. The only thing I Feel Michael Connelly can do to compensate us all for this serious loss of our dear friends is make a strong promise to write at least 1 ! novel per year about Mickey Haller cs and the time in between he can spend on writing about Harry Bosch. Vacation, preferably very limited. In this way he can at least prevent me a bit from starting the whole series over again..............

0756404738|5.0|\\"Wise Man's Fear\\" is a book any author would be proud to call his or her own. When \\"Name of the Wind\\" first came to my attention, I read it twice before reluctantly putting it down and beginning the long wait for the next installment to appear. During that wait, I wondered what \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" would be like, and if it could hold up to the original's greatness. However, the day I came home to a large box occupying my front steps, my concerns were blown away. The book resting inside was a heavy tome packed full of what I could only hope was more or the greatness found in the first book. I sat down and began to read.    Thankfully, I had nothing to worry about in the first place. \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" immediately sucked me back into the fascinating world introduced in NoTW. There was no time wasted on recapping the previous book, and the literary connections to NoTW (ie the \\"Silence\\" passages) brought a smile to my face and created a sense of coming home.    Where NoTW was effective in introducing characters and laying out an outline of both past and present, WMF delves deeper into Kvothe's past and gives more insight to his current position, as well as elaborating a little on just who Bast is and what the extent of his relationship to 'Reshi' might be. While there are fewer Interludes in WMF, the ones that are there are more relevant to the plot now, as readers become more comfortable with the relationships and personalities of each character. The story arc that Kvothe relays has also picked up from the first book. This time young Kvothe breaks out and travels across the continent, meaning readers get to enjoy both new characters and previously-unheard-of cultures. Rothfuss again shows his mastery of creation as he lets readers explore his world from east to west and even into the Fay.    Rothfuss's writing style has maintained its greatness through the second book. It's easy to read but packed with information, sometimes requiring me to pause and think about what I hadjust read. Other times I found myself laughing rather robustly in the middle of a coffee shop or other, equally as public places. Rothfuss's comedic nature seems to ooze itself into his words, whether he realizes it or not, and it creates a delightful blend of dramatic sequences and hilarious situations.    Finally, WMF brings to the table what its predecessor could not: by now we know who the characters are. We are beginning to understand their backgrounds. At this point, we have read through some of the feats Kvothe is famous for in NoTW. All of this combines to create a surprisingly urgent desire for more. Where NoTW gave an itch to know more about the characters and plot and world, WMF leaves readers with an ache to know what happens next, how things connect with each other. Especially with the final Interlude being one of great interest for those intrigued by Bast, the wait for Rothfuss's third book will undoubtedly seem even longer than it did for WMF. Fortunately, with Rothfuss behind the words, as soon as that third book finds its way to my doorstep, the wait will have been well worth it.
B000001FKY|5.0|Released in 1987 four years after their breakthrough t album, Pyromania , Hysteria remains UK band Def Leppard's peak commercially. The band may have thought it was impossible to have a more successful album than Pyromania was but they outdid themselves and Hysteria went on to sell more copies than its predecessor. Producer Mutt Lange wanted Hysteria to be a rock version of Michael Jackson's Thriller album; every track had to be a potential single. After the events following Pyromania which was a very successful record in its own right, the band came back and was now bigger than ever selling over 12 million copies in the U.S. alone, marking a truly magnificent comeback. Some listeners may feel that this album was overproduced, especially compared to the band's earlier albums On Through The Night and High `N' Dry but back then Hysteria was current and what was cutting edge. Hysteria is a softer, not so distant, but natural evolution of Pyromania an at that point many bands had gone softer with a more commercial and pop-like direction at this point.  With its seven singles (that's right, seven) Hysteria was simply inescapable if you were alive in the late 1980's and many of those songs continue to receive considerable airplay on classic rock radio.<br /><br />Hysteria is an achievement for the band. In 1984 drummer Rick Allen lost an arm in a vehicle accident making the 3 years between Pyromania and Hysteria difficult ones for the band. The band could've went on with another drummer but they supported Rick and the young drummer developed a new technique with the help of electronic foot pedals that allowed him to reproduce sounds he would usually play with both arms. It's really incredible that Rick was determined enough to continue when he could have been devastated and quit. The band being behind him and supporting him all this time says a lot about them. In fact Joe Elliot has been quoted as saying that Allen was a better drummer with one hand than two. It took the band 3 years to release the follow up to Pyromania but after a very welcomed comeback at Donington 1986 the band knew their fans would still be there for them, and they were. The process for Hysteria took longer than albums generally do and the band went over budget. Was it worth it? You tell me.<br /><br />\\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" remains the song Def Leppard is most popular for, say what you want about this song being commercial and radio-friendly but try, just try not to sing along or have that chorus stuck in your hand, chances are both will eventually happen. I probably heard it too many times for my liking but it's still a great song and one of Lepp's signature songs. \\"Rocket\\" is another classic, one of the highlights of the album and one of the hardest rocking. \\"Animal\\" remains one of my favorite song from this album, it's just a fantastic song with a terrific chorus and simply put, it's the band doing what they do best. \\"Armageddon It\\" is pure Leppard, its rocking, it's catchy and its highly effective, what more could you want? Hysteria has plenty of good time rock'n'roll but it also has its soft moments:\\"Love Bites\\" is one of the best ballads Def Leppard has done, it's intense and sounds very heartfelt, it's one of my favorite songs by the band and it was a huge hit for them. The title track \\"Hysteria\\" is less a ballad than it is an anthem, it's a slow and powerful song with meaningful lyrics unlike many of the Hair/Glam bands that were popular during the 1980s.<br /><br />In 2006 a deluxe edition of Hysteria was released with an extra disc of unreleased content like B-Sides, extended versions, remixes as well as bonus and lives tracks. If you're a hardcore fan of the band or if you love this album then it might be worth it to upgrade for the deluxe edition. It's always cool for fans to get bonus unreleased content and this one has more than an entire CD devoted to them. Hysteria was well deserving of this \\"Deluxe\\" treatment!<br /><br />Hysteria is Def Leppard at the height of their success, try they would but Def Leppard would never get to this level again. Hysteria is not my favorite Def Leppard album but this was the band at the peak of their popularity and most successful. I think Hysteria remains one of the best things the band has ever done and the music is still as good today as it was back then, it stood the test of time and those songs are now classics. Interesting enough at the time of its release Hysteria was the longest rock album ever made at little less than 63 minutes, this has since changed but it was an impressive feat back then. The band would try to match the success of Hysteria with 1992's Adrenalize and subsequent releases. Hysteria marks a high point in Def Leppard's career and is an overall, excellent and very solid album continuing what they had begun a few years earlier with Pyromania. 5/5 Recommended.ss, try they would but Def Leppard would never get to this level again.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|I really love this album so much, I am so glad that I got it.. All her songs are a lot different and I liked that a lot, and she did a really good job working on this album.. She has worked her ass off on this album to get it where it needs to get.. Glad I bought this cd.
B000F1IQNM|2.0|There's no danger of this series ever becoming classic.  I read the books first, which weren't easy to track down (I had to use Interlibrary Loans to find and get them).  The books were atrocious to say the least.  It was not difficult to reason why they were out of print and almost impossible to find.  Why Emma Thompson would pick them to make into films is unfathomable.  Although, admittedly, she did make the first movie slightly more palatable than the books she almost based it on.<br /><br />Barely watchable, it's not a keeper and I've no desire to seek out the sequel or the movie that's supposed to follow it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|No issues, successful searches, quick and easy downloads. Easily convert video to music format. Even includes artwork with downloaded file. Will allow me to sign into youtube account. This works better than my PC download/converting program. I have recommended this app to those I know will use it correctly.
6305127646|2.0|I bought this DVD based on the many rave reviews posted here.<br />Unfortunately, I didn't have the same viewing experience; I found this movie enormously disappointing.  It probably didn't help that I am not a fan of Val Kilmer (and subsequently found his performance hammy at best, self-indulgent at worst).  None of his so-called disguises hid who he was thus making them null (he actually had it written into the plot: the more the merrier).  It's not surprising to learn that many actors turned down this role (even Arnold Schwarzenegger!).  The plot was preposterously pseudo-sci-fi junk; a one joke concept.  It wasn't even really a \\"Saint\\" movie, just some guy who happened to use the same name.  There was one too many endings (again, no surprise as the \\"real\\" ending did not test well with audiences so they had to make a quick change).  As for the miraculous recovery of Elisabeth Shue's character...the oft mentioned heart problem simply went away!  What was the point in giving her a debilitating ailment only to later ignore it because it proved inconvenient to the story (in the first version of the film her character dies)?<br /><br />A huge hit in 1997, notwithstanding, I didn't like anything about it.  Not a keeper.

B00479SVBU|5.0|After endless frustration with chapters playing out-of-order, ignoring  alpha-sort and/or numerical sort order, I called Satechi. I asked the tech if Satechi devices could use a play list. He informed me that the only \\"play list\\" the devices used was the date the file was created.    This is not the easiest tag to change in a file. When copying files and folders to SD or Flash, if the files (chapters) are small many will copy and create files with exactly the same creation date. There seems to be no \\"fall back\\" sort scheme that Satechi uses, and those files with the same date seem to play in random order.    This is a glaring fault in an mp3/Wma player that Satechi advertises as ideal for audio books. It's not.     Proper format for books would be alpha order of the files, within alpha ordered folders. It should also use standard playlists.    Other than the above, I love everything else about the SoundFly AUX, and it's still so much better than anything else for books in the car I still gave it a \\"5\\".    Today, I found what I feel to a great solution for this issue. A program called \\"AttributeMagicPro\\" (google it).    This super file utility has the capability of resetting nearly every \\"tag\\" an mp3/wma file could have, and some specialized tags for photo files as well.  Not only that, but you generate simple \\"templates\\" that govern how the attributes are changed. You can then simply recall a template and apply it to your files.    For books to be played on the SoundFly Aux, I set up a template to SEQUENTIALLY re-tag the files \\"created\\", \\"Modified\\", and \\"Accessed\\" date tags, starting with a specified date, specified time, and then incrementing the minutes by 1 minute for each file. It can also handle special tags for photo files as well.    This program can then \\"re-date\\" all date tags on one file, a thousand files, or a directory full of files AND folders in seconds.    You can direct it to sort any tag including filename before conversion, so you can order your book correctly before performing the batch re-tag. The files are modified \\"in place\\" so you can change them after they are moved to SD or Flash, or perform the modification on your hard drive first. Then copying them as a batch to your ram will not change the times enough to get them out of order.    They can then be directly copied to a SD card or Flash Ram, and playback in a completely predictably manner.    It works beautifully.  It's not \\"freeware\\", but the price of $30.00 is very reasonable considering the utility of the software. After May 7th, it goes up to $35.00. They offer a free trial, but it's limited to a \\"batch\\" of 20 files at a time.    note: the program can also modify file attributes (read-only, hidden, system, etc.) as well as tags. It's extremely flexible, and very easy to use.    I personally think Satechi should make some arrangement for all Satechi devices to ship with this software, since their scheme of playback order is so unusual for an mp3/wma player, 99% of which will use a standard play list, or play in ascii sort order. Even their in-dash AM/FM/CD player uses this non-standard ordering.

B003ASLJS6|4.0|I had seen this movie at the theater when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked the fact how a \\"gun fighter\\" who was supposedly killed by Stockburn was using a disguise as a preacher and did a very convincing job at that. The part of the story I liked the best, is how a supposedly cold blooded gunslinger found compassion for his fellow man in the form of a handful of miners in Carbon Canyon and was able to exact his revenge on Stockburn and his deputies for what they had done to him earlier and for the problems LaHood had caused the miners. The New Army 1858 conversion revolver that he used with pre-loaded replacement cylinders is awesome. I believe Cimarron and Uberti both make accurate replicas of this model. I would give Pale Rider 4 out of 5 stars because it cannot unseat my all time favorite The Outlaw Josey Wales.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I bought my bruno mars cd on amazon.com,i love this cd i was happy with the service i did not wait long for my product and it was in beautiful condition .i will be ordering from amazon again.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am rather upset this is available ONLY in Blue Ray format, or at least, it appears that way.  While Blue Ray is becoming more popular, I am quite miffed that I can't get it in a regular DVD version.  So, guess 20th Century FOx has lost at least one sale!
B004N66XYE|5.0|We were huge fans of the original series so snatched this right up when it became available. We loved it. It is definitely different from the original but I think it needs some time to gather a following. At first it felt very strange seeing a new family in 165 Eaton Place and 1930's interiors but the impeccable cast started to grow on us and realizing this is definitely a sequel, not a remake, made us embrace it fully. We really hope they make more episodes!!!!!
B0047Y17P2|1.0|The book was mediocre to say the least, but to add insult to injury they were charging more that the actual hardcover version!. Stop the greed, or you will kill the golden goose.
1881273156|5.0|Whenever a friend gets engaged I give them this book as a gift. I think its simplicity fares well for male readers as well as females. This book gives couples a new lexicon of expressing how they feel and receive their spouse's love. I know that by being able to articulate in such a literal way to my own husband due to this book and the new context it gave us in expressing our love it's made it easier to just simply say what you want. Being able to receive and give is really important but the way in which you do those things are just as important. How many of you out there fight about the way something was said or done as opposed to the actual act itself? This book is for those viewers who miscommunicate as opposed to mistreat.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Much better and more functional than docs to go or any other out there. Highly recommend it. It's also pretty cheap.<br />The more I use this app the more impressed I am with it, and it keeps getting better with latest updates.<br />To the developer, Keep up the very good work.
B004I1AGTC|4.0|Due to the limited release of this follow up to the original Ip Man movie I wasn't able to see this in the theater.  So, I waited for this to come out on DVD and also on Amazon Video Streaming.  The wait was well worth it.<br /><br />This is a great martial arts film, and movies along at a very nice pace, with lots of tension as you cheer on Ip Man.<br /><br />Though I really liked the film, I gave it four stars rather than five because I liked the first film much better.  That's because the story in the first film was a bit more original, meaning this story was predicable (reminded me of Rocky), but still worth watching.<br /><br />Viewers should know that this film isn't exactly a biopic, but loosely based on the life of Yip Man, who taught Wing Chung to Bruce Lee.<br /><br />If you've seen the first Ip Man, you definitely need to see this film.<br /><br />Donnie Yen is outstanding.  Looking forward to seeing more of him in the future.

Rating it down will **NOT** accomplish any of the following:    1) Convince anybody to not sell the product  2) Change people's mind about buying the product  3) Convince Lucas to release the original product  4) Fulfill your life    There are better ways of trying to convince Lucas to release something different, and this is not one of them.    As for me, I'm excited for this product to be released and can't wait for it to reach my door-step.  2-day delivery?  Yes, please!  Get it here soon!  And you are all invited for the Star Wars Marathon when it gets here.
B00006FDCD|1.0|So i was expecting a full recreation of the book IT itself, but this movie only shows one part of the book (when they were all kids). It does not show the second part which is when they face him when they are older. I got thrown off by the end because it really doesn't end that way in the book.
B004SDEP38|5.0|My Xoom tablet was just a toy until I got the full version of this app. I used it to read a PDF of a music score while switching back and forth between it and the music app that played the mp3.

1439108277|5.0|If physics has rock stars, Walter Lewin is one. If physicist rock stars can have groupies, I confess to being one.<br /><br />As I read the publisher's text about the book, I felt a little blush. Could that refer to me?! Truly, Walter Lewin's online lectures changed MY life. Sounds silly? Well it's true. Not only did I get very interested in a subject I thought out of my grasp, but I continued my education in physics. I \\"discovered\\" a lot of application of physics to my business practice. To shorten the story, I use physics in my business and my clients have benefited greatly and my career has blasted off.<br /><br />Now, the book is like listening to Dr. Lewin talk. For a fan, what could be better? The videos of his lectures might be better but they are very math intense. The book is light on the math. That's good.<br /><br />I do wish the book had more than than the too brief picture collection about 2/3'ds through. I would like some illustrations to go with the topical discussions. Still, overall, I love the book but that's because I see Dr. Lewin as a sort of virtual mentor. I could never afford MIT or qualify to get in to MIT. Dr. Lein's lectures opened MIT to me.<br /><br />So a physics fan, and especially a Walter Lewin fan, will love the book.  I hope every one of his students will buy two copies (I did)---cherish one and give the other away. Your gift may inspire the next Einstein (male or female).<br /><br />The only negative? That beautiful Dutch accent, which lends itself to physics, doesn't come through in print.<br /><br />Great read.

B004RUF9DC|5.0|One of the most beautiful, and expensive, films made of the life of Christ. Hated by most critics in 1965, a box ofice disaster, cut from the original 260 minutes to 225 then to 199, and even cut down to 141 minutes. What we have on Blu-Ray is not the 225 minutes Roadshow version but what seems to be the only existing 199 minutes version. Which means thanks to the disgraceful policy of United Artists of dumping their movies, wherever - after initial release, director George Stevens' masterwork will never been seen in it's true glory or length, and seems lost forever. The Blu Ray edition is the best quality yet on home video and is a must for any true lover of the intelligent Hollywood epic. But, compared to \\"Ten Commandments\\", \\"The Bible, in the beginning...\\" and \\"King of Kings\\" (which were released at the same time on Blu Ray, and are all superb), the picture quality is very disappointing, but it's the best and only one we have. Unfortunately from the obvious deterioration visible on the print, it is doubtful if future generations will be able to see even this version, unless something is done very quickly to restore and save it, and that whould be a tragic loss, as it is not only George Stevens' most mature and heartfelt work as a director, but also composer Alfred Newman's finest score.
0345522478|5.0|This is based on a free Advanced Reading Edition I received for free in exchange for a review.     The plot sounds simple enough- Atticus O'Sullivan has a sword and Aenghus Og wants it, so Atticus must outwit Aenghus until the unavoidable final confrontation.     Of course, things aren't all that simple. Atticus is a two thousand year old druid, and has worked hard at staying alive for a long time. With earth magic, and friends ranging from werewolves to an elderly widow, Atticus manages to survive the various machinations of Aenghus. Aenghus himself doesn't show up until the very end, but his hand is everywhere. He is one of the Celtic gods, many of whom make an appearance in this story.  While it is clear from the beginning that Aenghus will do anything to destroy Atticus, the motivations of the other gods and goddesses that show up aren't nearly as straight forward. It leaves the reader guessing just what is happening, and what is going to happen. It makes for some delightful twists and turns throughout the pages of the book.     Atticus is a well-created character, with enough humanity to make him enjoyable to read about. He is also unique, not a copy of the characters a reader usually finds in the pages of urban fantasy. His age isn't just an afterthought, but tied into the character. His experiences are alluded to regularly, just like anyone else would talk about their past. I especially enjoyed the way old phrases were used along side modern idioms.     The various gods and goddesses are true to the tales told about them, with motivations all their own. They play with the humans, and have their own sort of moral code they live by. I've read a lot of Celtic and Nordic mythology, and I love how the gods and goddesses come alive in this story as they interact with the modern world.     I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was a wonderful book to start a new series, and I highly recommend it!

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I too will cast my review as a vote for the original theatrical release instead of these reworked versions.  Every work of art has flaws, but no true artist will ever go back and try to redo the original.  Every time you alter a work of art by adding or changing, you lose something of what made it a great work of art to begin with.

The premise- how does a world-renowned bad guy top a evil competitor in the face of the harrowing threat of three adorable orphan girls. Good stuff. Include this in your DVD library!
B004BBDHEK|5.0|I downloaded Truth of Touch last week and I thought I would pass along my impression.  ToT is another great album from Yanni in the pop philharmonic vain. There are 15 tracks and most are pumping powerful Yanni. There is one track that is more opera and IMHO doesn't fit, thats not to say it is bad only that it is a completely different ilk.   I'm giving the album 5 stars. I would say that if you love Tribute, Ethnicity and Nikki Na NA you will love ToT.
B004WPIJ4I|4.0|If \\"Judas\\" is an example of what will be on LG's Born This Way album then I must say I am waiting with breath that is bated. I was a bit worried after the whole BTW fiasco (not all that original, heavily borrowed from other artists, been-there-done-that, too preachy) but for all its flaws, \\"Judas\\" is a solid hit. It sounds like the old LG.
0385335997|5.0|The first three books in this series - [[ASIN:0385319959 Outlander]], [[ASIN:0385335970 Dragonfly in Amber (Outlander, Book 2)]] and [[ASIN:0385335997 Voyager (Outlander, Book 3)]]are among some of my all-time favorite reads.  I have read (and re-read, and re-re-read) them countless times, recommended them to just about everyone who has ever asked for something fabulous to read, daydreamed about James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser for hours uncounted, given them as gifts, and wished I had written them a million times over.  The series includes many of my favorite elements - plausible time travel with a smattering of equally plausible supernaturality, cool and informative historical detail that has been meticulously researched yet is presented as though it all derived from the author's own head, a phenomenal strong and sassy female lead, a smoking hot and studly yet unbelievably tender man's man of a hero, utterly wicked villains, and just the right amount of death, destruction, and mayhem to be entertaining and engaging without being an action movie.  These books are, in short, just about perfect.
1439190275|5.0|This book is easy to read, and the plan is easy to follow. I noticed a huge difference just after following the plan for a little over a week - my clothes fit better, I lost 5 pounds, and had more energy. But I then went on a carb binge and ruined my progress. No good reason why, but I know I can get back on the Atkins plan and see results quickly and eat really great food!
B0036TGSIK|4.0|After reading THE SCARLET LETTER in High School English class, just to see what happens Olive Prendergast decides to spread the untrue news that she has had sex with a guy from the local Community College. She adds a little spice to her story by faking sex with a few of her in-the-closet gay male friends.<br /><br />Before she knows it, she has straight boys knocking down her door and girls picketing her with \\"Slut\\" signs. Things get out of hand when a high school hotshot attempts a date rape. Things get even worse when a Bible-thumping idiot on the ten year graduation plan covers his infidelity by telling everyone that Olive gave him an STD.<br /><br />All the knots get unraveled in the end, and everybody lives happily ever after, as might be expected in this fizzy little movie, which is far, far better than it's storyline would suggest. A good deal of the credit for the quality comes from the incredibly talented cast, which features Lisa Kudrow, Stanley Tucci, Amanda Bynes, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Hayden Church, Malcolm MacDowell, and Emma Stone, who received a Golden Globe nomination for this role.<br /><br />Emma, who has a very strong resemblance to Lindsay Lohan B.T. (Before Trainwreck) is somebody we will be seeing again, hopefully often. As the quick-witted Olive, Emma entertains everybody involved in this film, including the audience, the cast and crew, and even, most impressively, herself, as she enjoys Oliving her way through the story.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
143911000X|5.0|This book is awesome! Its a good book to read because you WILL learn how to be a good bro and help you pick up hot ass.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|It was most unfortunate to have such a low budget for this film, but it was an amazing story and well played. I can't wait for Boondock Saints 3.
B003UESJFQ|5.0|Great cast, including Miranda Richardson and Sally Hawkins, in a real-life story of 1968 labor dispute.  Cannot understand why this film never played in ordinary theatres.  We had to buy it in order to see it, but it is well worth the price.
B003V9OCS8|5.0|i love hiking and climbing and being outdoors, and after watching this movie i still do. but it portrays a very sobering view of what love for adventure can do to people. probably one of the best movies ive ever watch and i recommend it to anyone who loves adventure.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|This game is way better then expected! Lots of fun. Lots of different things to do in it. The games are getting way better.
0316789720|3.0|This book has tons of tiny figures of everyday items that can be learned how to draw for art journaling.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Esta es una de las mejores series que alla visto en este genero, lo unico que me parecio no muy bueno es la caja en la que vienen los DVDs ya que no tienen el espacio adecuado para que se guarden bien, se rayan con facilidad por lo demas EXCELENTE!!!![[ASIN:B003PIUBZS Spartacus: Blood and Sand - The Complete First Season]]
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|This game is hands down one of the most detailed, entertaining and easily controlled games in its class. Because of the unassuming price, I did not expect the depth of weapons, boats, gifts for the girl, achievements, quests, and all sorts of little deetails that make this game a must have for anyone that likes a good laugh and explosions.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Wish it was longer. Great graphics and a lot of fun. I had no problems with FCs.  Installed on Droid X.
B000002WYT|5.0|I'm a musician and try to listen to as many different musical styles as possible. For instance, in the past 48 hours I've listened to: Bartok, Synergy, Jean Luc Ponty, James Brown, Van Der Graaf Generator, Chopin, Radiohead, Styx, Bach, John McLaughlin, The Clash, Talking Heads, Randy Roos, Billy Joel and a couple others I can't recall off the top of my head.    You get the picture, right? ;-)    That being said, I can't imagine how ANYONE with any appreciation for good music would consider this an inferior recording. It boggles the mind to read some of the single star reviews. It's as if those people are upset with the DMB being popular and hate the record for that reason alone; or perhaps they hate the people who are fans of this band? Who knows!     First and foremost, Crash is the first DMB CD that I own, having bought it at a second hand store after my son asked me: \\"hey, dad, do you own any DMB? I heard they're pretty good\\". So, I bought it.    Crash is a FUSION of folk rock, roots rock, jazz, world/African, progressive rock, psychedelic and yes, POP! It has some rather commercial moments, but the majority is relatively adventurous and free-flowing. I won't break down each track, since others have already done an excellent job of that.    This is an upbeat, positive record that should be enjoyed on Summer afternoons or on a road trip. EXCELLENT car music. As for the issues that some have with Dave's vocals, well, to each his/her own. I happen to like his vocals a LOT. I think his voice is perfect for this style of music.     Forget those cretins who thumbed down this CD and give this record a chance. It's a solid addition to any varied music collection.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|This game is fun at first, but it quickly becomes tedious due to the repetitiveness of the patterns that fruits are thrown at you. It needs a bit more variety.
B001EN71HC|5.0|Watching these films one after the other, one is aware of just how good they are. Though full of vulgar/sexual humor that sometimes steps over the line (it's amazing how close they come to an R rating), they're also extremely funny. I saw \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\\" with a friend in 1999, and the \\"fisting\\" scene reduced me to such uncontrollable laughter he thought he was going to have to help me out of the theater. The father/son therapy session and the Jerry Springer \\"My dad is evil and wants to take over the world\\" are other highlights. Frankly, Myers does movie spoofs a lot better than Brooks.<br /><br />My only complaint is Heather Graham. She's pretty, and... That's about it. Her \\"acting\\" is dreadful, unacceptable even in a high-school pageant.<br /><br />The image quality is terrific, sharply detailed with psychedelically eye-popping color. I thought the phosphors in my plasma set would blow out. A bit of grain is visible at times, but this shows that little or no grain reduction was used, which is almost always A Good Thing. (Grain reduction usually degrades sharpness and detail.)
0061673730|1.0|I had been interested in this book since the 'eighties, largely because of its title and the fact that I have a strong interest in philosophy and have been a motorcycle rider for over forty years.  I ordered it for my Kindle and slogged through about 60 percent of it, but I'm sorry - I can't take any more.  Clearly, either this guy has some serious real psychiatric illness or is jerking all our chains for a profit.  In either way, I'm out of here.  This is only one of two books in my entire life I have abandoned before finishing it.  Dense philosophy is one thing, but this is fraud.  God help those of you who try to see it through to the end.
B004UID2LC|5.0|The app does exactly what it says. The interface is intuitive and it was able to download the videos I wanted in multiple format options including audio only.
0545265355|4.0|The books are amazing in themselves. I highly recommend them to everyone, and ask them to at least give it a try. However, the last book of the series was received as damage, but still readable. I'm pretty sure this has nothing to do of the seller, I believe it was the packaging company themselves who distributed the books at the beginning. The shipment was on time, and I was pleased with the seller. I would purchase items again from them if the chance came.
B004LL1HM4|1.0|As a friend said to me about this, quoting Andrew Earles from 2008:    \\"Are we still dealing with a bunch of pretty boys who rock the '70s hitchhiker-chic/Peckinpah-extra look while dragging the lifeless corpse of indie rock further into the bottomless void of mass-consumed Bonnaroo/jam-band/neo-hippie culture? With 'computer-generated' hooks that unadventurous minds hear as real hooks, these bands belong where they're gunning for: background music in Bank Of America and Pontiac commercials.\\"    These boys have mastered their instruments and play with poise and obvious sincerity. But for my tastes, they simply have nothing to say. That's it.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|I love this little guy- but, my particular unit has a manufacturing defect. The switch for the bass boost is faulty and requires much toying with to prevent it from shorting between flat/bass response, resulting in unbalance and static. To be fair, I contacted Micca Store and they offered a very reasonable solution: send my bad unit, they'll send me a new one. However, I was getting ready to travel and wanted my portable amp to, well, port with me and there was a decent chance that I would not receive the replacement before I left. Took my chances with the defective unit and the switch seems to be nearing critical failure.    When the switch does sit right, the improvement over the headphone-out of my portable player is very noticeable - regardless of which cans I am wearing - and the amp (or an amp) is an absolute necessity for high impedance cans or when looking to dial-up the eq for more \\"punch\\" out of open cans when listening to rock/rap genres.    At $20 (approx), I really want to give this device a 5-star rating, but I caught some bad luck with my unit and the waiting time/postage for exchange makes doing so (somewhat) cost-prohibitive. That being said, my experience is not the norm. Fiio and Micca Store (the authorized Fiio U.S. distributor) have earned a good reputation from headphone enthusiasts/audiophiles. If this review looks overly gloomy, I'm actually getting ready to order a Fiio E7, DAC/Portable amp combo, to replace my E5 and will be ordering through Micca Store (via Amazon). As a fan of redundancy, I want to close by saying that I love the E5, but not *my* E5. If you're looking for tremendous value of the \\"almost too good to be true\\" variety, by a Fiio product, from Micca Store, and you will likely be very pleased.
B000641D2Y|5.0|I am very satisfied with the purchaise. The seller was  very professional and the product arrieved in a timely manner as stated by the seller. Will recommend the seller to anyone. Thank you!
B0037KMHRY|5.0|This is one of the most amazing scores I've ever heard for a movie. Its also possibly the most different score. Daft Punk's electronic sound is heavily heard on a few of the tracks. The orchestration is just amazing, and is truly different throughout the entire album.  There are many great string arrangements like on the track Adagio For Tron. It just builds the entire track very powerfully. And then there is of course the track Derezzed which is PURE Daft Punk signature sound. So Amazing. I would highly recommend listening to this soundtrack through a surround sound system. The sound will just take your breath away its so amazing.     My favorite tracks are:  - The Grid  - The Son Of Flynn  - The Game Has Changed (The best track on the album)  - Adagio For Tron  - End Of Line  - Derezzed  - Tron Legacy (End Titles)    Of course like every soundtrack there are missing tracks. Most of which are exclusively downloadable through amazon, itunes etc. As well as Journey's \\"Separate Ways\\" and The Eurythmics' \\"Sweet Dreams\\" which are the only two songs used in the movie which do not appear on the soundtrack. But even so, the soundtrack is just AMAZING.    End Of Line.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Overall a great movie for all the Potter fans. I especially liked the Maximum Movie Mode, anyone who has not read the book should see the movie in this mode, at least once.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|This app is awesome!  Now that it works perfectly on my xoom I can finally say goodbye to my ipad for good.  its one of the best looking apps on android in my opinion and it completes my media center build out.   Highly recommend this!
1591844096|1.0|IMO, a waste of time. I chose this book based on comments from a couple of bloggers that I respect, but was disappointed. The best stuff is near the end and relates to the fact that \\"great artists ship [their products]\\". Beyond that, this book is a motivational speech by a marketing guy. I don't disagree with the premise that the move to knowledge based work necessitates a change in the way we view and promote ourselves, but book doesn't offer much in terms of actionable advice. Godin would probably point to his assertion that everyone must create there own map. I think that rationale is a cop out for not spending time doing good research before writing a book.<br /><br />Daniel Pink's book \\"Drive\\" covers much of the same territory as Godin does, but does it in a well researched, scientific, and actionable way.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|- Excellent quality  - Nice packaging  - Nice extras (haven't tested the BD-Live though yet)  No issues so far.  Thanks.
0143116177|3.0|I've had this on my list to read for a long time. I've seen the PBS video series. The book was a bit of a slog at times with names and dates and numbers... The stuff I always hated about history. Overall I'd say the book was pretty good and there's not a good way to avoid the names/dates stuff, but it didn't really go any deeper than the video. So my recommendation is skip the book and watch the video which is more entertaining.
B004INNRFK|5.0|Just as he did with \\"Hit Man\\" a couple of years ago, David Foster has given us an excellent mix of performers backed by super arrangements.  The audio and video quality is also of the highest level.  A super buy....and you get CD & DVD to enjoy.  DVD is best part of set with more music.
020161622X|5.0|I just finished re-reading this book. I think I must have read it several years ago. After adding several years experience I found myself shaking my head up and down a lot.  Yep. Been there - done that. Seen that problem before. Very good book. Great for someone after a few years experience. Worthwhile to revisit again after more then ten years experience.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Won't download. Just sits there. Htc Evo.  Would love for them to fix this so it works. Will keep trying.
1936719010|1.0|Long story short. The author didn't do the work.<br /><br />No serious research. No great insights. This is a book you can read sitting on the toilet. Then get back to work. It's psychobabble and creative use of fonts to push slogans that sound like they were copied off of the motivational posters in the hallway.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this book was that I got it for free.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|Awesome app with a lot of potential but lacking a lot of integration.  For one,  it doesn't play nice with exchange as it does not allow you to view all of your exchange calendars,  only your primary one.  To see those calendars I ended up getting touchdown,  which works great except for the fact that it won't show google calendars.  If this app is supposed to be for business,  then it needs to have full exchange capabilities or at minimum pull the calendars from TouchDown.  Until then this app is useless.  Please fix soon!
B003EV6DBM|4.0|I love this series, I watched it on Netflix and decided to buy the series because of how much I liked it.   That being said lets talk about the packaging. The previous packaging for the series was good and the usual style that you see when you get a season of a show. But this one kind of sucked. Each disc is in it's own plastic tray which is fragile.  They trays are put together like a book and it's hard to get a disc out because the center thingy doesn't release easily.   I like the series but hope that next season the packaging is done better.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I normally don't write much, but I thought I should do this, since it was the help of many Amazon reviewers that made me decided to buy this watch. I guess it's my way of saying thank you for all the hard work I saw in these pages.    I have this watch for almost 6 months now and I normally use it to run outside, but sometimes I also use in the gym. I use it together with the Heart Rate monitor and the Foot pod. I wear it with good and bad weather, rain, snow, hot and humid temperatures, cold and dry weather, etc... I already accumulated 1000 miles and I didn't have any major issues so far.    I'm a runner, 6'1, 200 pounds. I normally run 5 to 6 times a week and the FR 405CX goes with me all the time. I'm not an expert, but I can work with a computer. It's an interesting device, but not without some issues.    When you first received, I recommend to read the instructions. It's not that difficult to operate it, but the bezel needs some time to get used to. After setting it and doing my 1st run, I connected to the Garmin program. You will have to download some programs to fully integrate with your computer, but when it's done, I didn't have any issues. It's basically straightforward. Garmin Connect it's a basic Web program and besides that there's Garmin Training Center, a primitive computer based program. I use GC most of the time to review my workouts and I leave the GTC only to make my so-called Advanced Workouts (I write more later on).    The GPS works nicely and connection is fast. I use this watch in US, Europe and Asia, without problems. If required to work indoors, the footpod is very reliable and accurate. I'd recommend it to buy it together.    During my training, the 405CX can display a myriad of information in 3 pages plus a Heart Rate page. I normally use 2 pages with Distance, lap pace, HR, Time, Time of day and Cadence. If I use the Advanced Workouts, the watch automatically adds another page with Lap Pace and Lap Distance remaining. I leave it to autoscroll and keep the Bezel locked. To be honest it's a little annoying that I might need to wait until the page shows the info I want - specially if I'm running hard - but I think it's still better than to have to deal with the bezel getting crazy because of sweat. Besides, I would prefer to have 4 fields per page as the FR310, not only 3.    The Advanced Workouts is a very nice tool to use it. Basically, you go to GTC and select what and how you want to do for your work out. You can pretty much ask for anything, like keeping a HR zone for some mins, then change your pace for some many miles, then do some Interval training, cool down, etc. and anytime, if you don't follow what you selected, there will be an alert, which helps me to maintain what I selected. I specially like to use it to keep a pace for some miles and then play with the pace.    The Heart Rate monitor is nothing special from other brands, but I've had some HR spikes sometimes (HR goes to 210 then back to 140); besides, it's a little weird that a sports watch can not be waterproof, and I don't see why the limitations for using during a swim, but that's the way Garmin had designed it.     The battery would last for 8 hrs using GPS, it seems appropriate for up to a Marathon, and for me it's enough. I normally keep the watch charged 100%, but during a 2hrs workout, with GPS, backlight on, foot pod and HR monitor enabled, it drains to 65%. If I used indoors, I disable the GPS and the battery lasts forever.    It's a little bulky to use in as a day-to-day watch, but I don't mind using it during weekends or casually. I wouldn't use in my job normally, but occasionally it would be OK too.    The price had dropped significantly after the release of FR 410 and now the new FR 610. If money is a concern and you don't want a TV on your arm (like the FR305 or the 310), then the 405CX is a nice selection.    I'm happy with the 405CX, but Garmin just released the FR610, which looks now as a better option (take a look on DCrainmaker review, it's well worth it). 6 months ago, FR 405CX was the best option for me, but if I have to buy a GPS watch today, I would recommend to spend a little more money and buy the FR 610.    I hope this review will help you in your decision.
B004LSO6YI|4.0|At first, I was skeptical buying this movie, even though 'Claire of the Moon' is one of my favorite movies and own the dvd, I still had my doubts.  I rented it instead and watched it.  I can tell you that I immediately placed it on my list to buy.  Even though some of the characters were horrible and lines were not strong enough (that is why 4 stars and not 5), the main actresses were amazing.  The journey of how they fell in love was intoxicating and had me glued to the screen.  I caught myself taking a quick breathe after the longest kiss I've ever seen.  Their chemistry is undeniably real.  Great job on casting these two.  Necar was beautiful and Traci, Oh my God, her eyes was so captivating.  I would fall for her, she's gorgeous.  And the love scenes were...well I will let you be the judge of that.    If your looking for an enjoyable evening sitting back, relaxing and watching a good lesbian movie, this is it.  It's a great love story and almost makes you believe in finding your soulmate!  It is a must see again movie, I would definitely recommend it and can't wait for Nicole Conn and Marina Rice Bader next movie.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|As much as I want to love everything by the beloved artists I have grown up listening to, something always seems to come up short when it comes to their more recent material.  Oh sure, I can always find something to like but, to me, they are never quite able to re-capture those glory days and deliver something that truly blows me away. There are, however, exceptions.    \\"In your Dreams\\" is one of those rare exceptions.    After hearing the single for \\"Secret Love\\", I expected a solid but rather adult contemporary affair.  I really liked the song but was still a bit skeptical on how good this album would actually be as a whole.  What I have been listening to the last 2 days is an album that has surpassed every expectation I had.  To sound cliche - IT ROCKS!!!! and may be the BEST Stevie Nicks album ever produced.    Poetic, Haunting and Beautiful.    If you have ever appreciated Stevie Nicks as a true artist, this album is not to be missed. Do yourself a favor, purchase it, then listen to it front to back at least once without interruption.  Give it a chance to soak under your skin. I gurantee it will. If you can't find something to love on this album, you probably weren't much of a Stevie Nicks fan in the first place.     Stevie should be proud of herself to have created something so special at this point in her career.  I congratulate her and Dave for a job well done.  Thank you both so much for this gift.  Let's do it again real soon, shall we?
030726999X|3.0|I was excited to finally sit down and read the last in the trilogy, having been sucked into the first book (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and then pleasantly surprised by the continuation of the action in the second book. Maybe I was impatient and read it too quickly, but I just couldn't get into this story.  There's lots of coffee drinking, hand-wringing, thinking, pacing, courtroom scenes, etc. etc. but none of the sparkle (if you can call it that) and vitality of our violent heroine really showed up.  The author is unquestionably talented and RIP, but he just phoned it in here.  There's much less action in this book than the previous two stories. The enigmatic Girl and her background is revealed somewhat but she's badly injured, tired and worn out.  And I was disappointed by the flatness of the tone of the book.  Call me crazy as there are so many great reviews here and--maybe I missed the subtleties of the novel, but personally, I didn't enjoy it anywhere near what I thought I would.  Sort of surprised I didn't see \\"...and I would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for you meddling kids...\\" at the end. Three stars for a formulaic novel.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|This is the story of a brilliant and eccentric scientist, Dr. Hans Zarkov, who perceives an anomalous solar eclypse and catastrophic meteor shower to be an &#34;attack&#34; on the earth from malighn otherworldly forces, .. a spunky female reporter named Dale Arden, .. and a heroic quarterback,none other than the title character Flash, who travel to an alien galaxy to confront the dreaded Ming the Merciless, .. the instigator of the destructive assault and ruthless monarch of his homeworld Mongo. The gallant Flash is ultimately compelled to both save the earth from impending destruction and rescue Dale from becoming Mings wedded &#34;concubine&#34; ( &#34;Seize the earth woman and prepare her for our pleasure!!&#34; ) by leading the outlandish denizens of this far-out alternate realm in revolt against the mighty despot and his fiendish forces. They include a race of winged &#34;hawkmen&#34; who reside in a floating city whom Flash rouses into a calvalry and leads, on a &#34;rocket cycle&#34;, in a battle against a &#34;war rocket Ajax&#34;, and a kingdom of forest men who dwell in trees and play a deadly barbaric game, similar to Russian Roullett, called &#34;try the woodbeast&#34; ( a scorpion-like creature dwelling in a stump in which they take turns sticking their arms ).<br /><br />Although Flash Gordon was made in the aftermath of the trend-setting Star Wars, it is no copy of THAT film.  This movie has it's own very distinctive style, visual look, and sense of humor and actually breaks the mold, .. defying many of the conventions that had been established by big SW. If you want to compare this flick to any other movie, it's actually much more similar to Barbarella ( with the campy humor and mild sexuality ),and also has some elements of The Wizard Of Oz.  It certainly strikes me as being much more similar to THOSE two particular movies than to big SW.<br /><br />And although a sci-fi / fantasy / adventure movie, this isn't quite what you could call a &#34;kids flick&#34;.  Rather, it's kind of a sci-fi / fantasy / adventure film for ADULT viewers ( not the boring kind of adult, .. but with a little bit of the ole kid inside ), or that adult viewers can find enjoyable anyway. Though kids can watch and enjoy it too ( for all the neato spaceships, spectacular visuals and far-out ideas ), and there's nothing overtly objectionable in it for them ( it's rated PG ), it does also have this slightly &#34;racy&#34; thematic element which makes it appealing to more &#34;mature&#34;( but again, not TOO &#34;mature&#34; ) viewers, .. . like some voluptuous female bodies clad in scanty costumes( though no outright nudity ), some pretty violent scenes ( particularly a harrowing and very well-staged duel with bullwhips on a wobling disc with a spiked floor and a guy shot through the back of a chair with a laser ),and how the villains in the film have a kind of sexually perverse edge to their character ( exemplified in a rather kinky flogging scene and in lines of dialogue such as &#34;You tortured her didn't you ?!!&#34; ... &#34;Yes!  A most interesting girl!  I do think that she rather enjoyed it !&#34; , .. . not lines of dialogue you'd hear Darth Vader utter, huh ? ).  THAT is what I consider to be the best thing about this movie though, .. . it's that very rare and exceptional kind of film which can appeal to BOTH the kid and the adult!  It's not totally juvenile ( like most space adventure or fantasy films tend to be ), yet not totally &#34;adult&#34; either,  but a combination of a little of both in the same. And if your the rare type of person who has BOTH the kid and adult in ya, then your just PERFECT for THIS flick !<br /><br />The screenwriting is often clever and funny, . . like when Dr. Zarkov pistol whips a fat assistant, whose reluctant to enter a rocket capsule, and declares &#34;NOW!! ... get your toothbrush and whatever!!&#34;. And how Flash is so noble, .. to the point of corniness ( &#34;Promis me that if you kill meyou'll team up with Vultan and fight Ming!&#34; .. &#34;It's rational transaction! One life for billions!!&#34; ). Some of the humor is even rather dark edged ( &#34;While you await the ceremony, all monitors will display, for your entertainment, the execution of the traitors.&#34; ).<br /><br />The funniest scene, by far, is the hilarious brawl between Flash and Mings goons, which takes place during a &#34;tribute&#34; ceremony and takes the form of a kind of football game ( complete with pep cheering from Dale Arden, &#34;GO FLASH!!

And the spacecraft designs are very stylish, quirky and original.  Don't believe the dunce reviewers who criticize the effects in this movie as being &#34;cheesy&#34;, .. . THEY'VE no doubt had too much CGI crap. The special effects techniques, though perhaps outmoded by todays standards, were actually quite modern and state of the art when this film was made.  They're things like mattes, blue screens and miniature models, .. . techniques which were very common then and were used in every other space adventure flick of this era ( including big SW and all it's imitators ).  There's also a very neat, stylish and visually striking title & opening credits sequence which uses actual illustrations from the old comic.<br /><br />The rock score by Queen is very effective.  It suits the tone and imagery of this film very well and, it should be noted, was quite an unorthodox and adventuresome choice at the time this film was made, which further distinguished it from Star Wars and all it's imitators( as they all used more traditional symphony scores ).  The main theme ( &#34;Flash, .. aa ahhhhh!!&#34; ) takes on a kind of humorously reverential quality, .. at times sounding much like an accapella hymm ( &#34;He saved everyone!! .. He saved everyone of us!! .. Every man, every woman, every child!!!&#34; ).fight Ming!&#34; .. &#34;It's rational transaction! One life for billions!!&#34; ). Some of the humor is even rather dark edged ( &#34;While you await the ceremony, all monitors will display, for your entertainment, the execution of the traitors.&#34; ).  The funniest scene, by far, is the hilarious brawl between Flash and Mings goons, which takes place during a &#34;tribute&#34; ceremony and takes the form of a kind of football game ( complete with pep cheering from Dale Arden, &#34;GO FLASH!! GO!!&#34; ) and during which the subjects of Ming get their first taste of defiance ( complete with Vultan, the hawkman, tripping a charging goon ).

0756404738|5.0|I've had mixed feelings about this book.  It is an amazing piece of literature and i hunger for the next volume in this series.  I hope Rothfuss doesn't stop at 3 in the king killer chronicles.<br /><br />There are parts of the story I got bored with and thought that they went on for far to long.  I think the entire section about hunting down the bandits, the time spent with the sign language ninjas, and parts with Denna were far to long winded and were made to fill a pool that was all ready plenty deep.<br /><br />But this is not my story.  This is Rothfuss's work, characters, and world. I'm anxious to see what he does with them next.<br /><br />I would like to see an entire Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition expansion set in this world of alchemy and magic.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|Works great on my samsung epic. Wonderful graphics, lots od tasks and levels. Overall so glad I got this game. i play it the most out of any game i have. rarely runs slow and has never frozen or crashed.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I hope more games of this type come along. In my opinion, it was too short. I would love new levels to be included in an update. The puzzles were fun.
B004Q1FDHO|3.0|Great game, I'm &quot;hooked&quot; so to speak. However, it needs an update to fix the bugs and freezing up that occurs like every 10 minutes of playing. Then, I would give it 5 stars!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've used quite a few calendar apps and by fat this one is the best. Does everything I want an calendar to do and more.
B001AQO3XS|5.0|I often dread plugging in a new BluRay disc because I am never 100% sure it will be worth upgrading from DVDs I already have. Highlander on BluRay is simply GORGEOUS. The sound is also spectacular. For people like me who stopped counting how many times they have seen this movie, this disc is a MUST posession.
B004SEVPWQ|1.0|Before you can play the game insists you accept the terms of their &quot;contract&quot; which is totally out of line with respect to other apps in the store. This is stupid. There are a bazillion other free games without this kind of nonsense, why it should be tolerated in a paid app is beyond comprehension.
B00005JNQS|4.0|Order was a gift for my son. He was very pleased with this DVD, since it was a favorite of his when he was a little boy. It arrived as stated in delivery time frame.

B000001FXV|5.0|When Bob Marley played the Lyceum Theater in London in the summer of 1973, Marley was just reaching stardom. He had started out in the 1960s with The Wailers, whose original lineup included Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, both of whom had incredible careers in the reggae genre as well (as solo artists, of course). The sides recorded on Trojan, JAD, and Wail'Em Soul'Em were largely unnoticed by the general public. But, that would all change. Marley signed on Island Records in late 1972, and released 'Catch a Fire' not long afterward.     Marley's career began to take off. By the time he died of cancer in 1981, Marley was already a legend. He had an incredibly loyal fanbase, and I have no doubt Marley would still be on top of the world if he were alive today. In 2011, he is more popular than ever, and rightfully so. You'd be hard pressed to find anybody with more talent than Bob Marley. He could write beautifully, sing masterfully, and knew how to fire up a crowd or just a group of people (what a showman he was!). Marley was truly an immortal legend; his loss is still felt 30 years after his passing.    'Live' was recorded at the Lyceum Theater over two nights in June 1973; Marley was just becoming a superstar by this point. This was recorded for the King Biscuit Flower Hour radio show, and the disc is a document to just how great he truly was in concert. You think he's masterful in the studio (which he was)? Oh boy are you in for a treat when you hear him live. He was quite the showman (as I said above), and if you need evidence of it, look no further.    There are incredible live versions of Marley standards. The early classics 'Lively Up Yourself' and 'Trenchtown Rock' are given great reinterpretations here; I actually prefer these versions to their studio counterparts. 'Lively Up Yourself' is especially good; Marley's energy and the crowd's energy really blend together to create a truly classic version of a truly classic reggae/ska tune.    But, the one track here that EVERYONE has heard is 'No Woman No Cry.' Yes, that famous version you heard on 'Legend' and elsewhere was recorded at this show. This is the definitive version. This track has something to do with why Marley catapulted to fame; the crowd singing along turns this into almost an anthem. Marley's vocals are affected, and the lyrics are gut-wrenching. This is a truly masterful version performed in a truly masterful way.    Overall, if you like Bob Marley & The Wailers and you don't own 'Live!,' you are missing out. Buy it immediately. This is one of the all-time great live albums; no lover of great live music should be without this one. Buy it and be amazed by the spectacle of a Bob Marley concert. Bob Marley may be dead, but his music will live on for many generations to come.     Buy 'Live' and listen to a truly great concert. Enjoy the show.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|great game fun for all my 10 y.o. loves it...some lag on intercept...great graphics...waiting for may puzzles to be added cant wait
B00003CY5J|5.0|I had previously only caught this partially on TV. Seeing it for the price I bought it immediately. It's really a great flick, lot's of action mixed up with some loving. Shows Robert DeNiro at his best too.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Never would I have though that 30 years after her first solo album that Stevie Nicks would record the most interesting and musically rich album of her career.  She sounds strong and sings with pride and confidence in her voice.  Her unique songwriting shines through in the form of angels, ghosts, and dreams as only she can deliver.  \\"In Your Dreams\\" sounds contemporary while honoring her past and even giving a couple nods to the blues.  Favorites include For What It's Worth, In Your Dreams, Italian Summer, You May Be The One, New Orleans, and Annabel Lee although there are no songs that drag this album down.  Buy it, listen to it in full, and appreciate the legend that is Stevie Nicks and the gift that she has graced upon us.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|i am picky when it comes to games i only like a few. i thought this would one of those games. i was wrong. is really fun and there are a lot different things to do. cute idea and fun to play!
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I had been eagerly awaiting a new Foo album for a while and this one does NOT disappoint!! These guys are one of the best bands out there and show no signs of slowing down. There is not one bad track on this album. WALK and I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN are the best tracks on here in my opinion, but they are all good songs. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes rock music. LONG LIVE THE FOO FIGHTERS!!
B004UOCF3W|5.0|Ever since getting this near the end of April, I've not really been able to listen to other music because of how moving this album is.  I'm not as old as some of the other reviewers, and I don't have their experience in listening to music, but this is definitely one of my favorites out of every genre.  Recently I got into Panic! at the Disco's discography, and that entire thing has captivated me less than this single album.  I'd recommend this to anyone who likes the genre, and even some people who don't.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|WOW, is all i can say, I have been waiting for this cd, and it blows me away. It was everything i was hoping it would be and more. Songs like Moonlight, Annabel Lee are something from Belladonna . For what it worth, In your dreams remind me of WIld Heart. Stevie Nicks just keeps getting better. Her music comes from the heart. Not cookie cutter stuff. She is  the  real deal. Would love to hear some new music from Fleetwood Mac next. This cd is truly a magical dream, get it , youll love it. thanks Stevie, go ahead, rock alittle.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|If you like movies that are dark and have a real story that makes you think then this is the movie for you.  Nina just wants to be perfect like most of us and drives herself too hard and crazy trying to do that.  The cast is great and the director and writer and everyone behind the scenes made this movie not make me blink once in the theater.  Not for kids.  Also def. not a typical ballerina movie.
B004G6009U|5.0|My daughter loved it.  She had been wanting to see it and we waited to put tangled in the easter basket.  We all had a great time watching this animated movie and would definately recommend this title to anyone.  Tangled is one of disney's best yet.  It is an entertaining twist on the old fairtale of Rapunzel and my daughter loved to watch it again and again.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I am officially boycotting this release.  As a fan of the original trilogy in their theatrical released forms, it really aggrivates me that George Lucas refuses to release them and treat them the same way he's treating his totally inferior \\"new\\" versions.  In fact I think he wants to act like they don't exist anymore.  That is unexceptable to me.  I WILL NOT buy this set or any other Stars Wars blu-ray set unless the original trilogy is released!    Why can't George Lucas just release this:    - A Blu-ray boxset of the original trilogy, in their original theatrical released forms, all cleaned up and treated with the upmost respect in terms of picture and sound quality  - Bonus disc(s) of all the bonus features from the original trilogy; like deleted scenes, making-of featurettes, etc.    Why is that so difficult?  That's all I want!  That's all millions of fans want!  There are many of us that ONLY enjoy the original trilogy, and are not fans of the new trilogy or the new versions of the original trilogy.
0812974611|5.0|I love disaster tales and this is one of the best!  Even better for knowing that it is based on reality.  The characters are well drawn and pompeii comes to life.  The sense of impending doom makes this an exciting and quick read.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|This book is really good.  I plan on reading it and listening to in on audible.com many times.  Anyone that wants to bring positive change to their life and change their thinking, this is the book.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|If you want the ORIGINAL trilogy, don't buy this release. It only includes the inferior \\"Special Editions\\". When will Lucasfilm learn that we want the ORIGINAL movies remastered in high def?
B00000IQV7|5.0|My VCR ate my old tape, and I loved the movie so much that I ordered a disk version.  Very satisfied. The service is great for ordering on-line.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Amazing relaunch to what was an amazing series already. Production values are unlike anything else current. Recommend this to any anime fan, more-so to any EVA fan.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I purchased this cd because I really liked the music. I also appreciated the compassion behind the intention. 93% of the profits go to build music schools in poor areas around the world. Am honored to be involved in this small way.
B004XKMEK2|2.0|One of the negatives about buying music is... you can't return it. :)  I thought from the little tidbits I could hear in the 30-second previews that it might be promising.. but besides the bangin' \\"On The Floor\\", this album is really a snoozer.
0756656230|5.0|My son got these books out at our locally library and loved them. I was thrilled when I saw Amazon had them and at such a reasonable rate. Free shipping was an extra bonus!

030746363X|4.0|You have to respect a guy that has dedicated his life to modifying variables for different positive outcomes. Ferriss covers a broad spectrum of topics from losing weight, gaining muscle mass, better sleep, better sex etc. Whatever aspect of your life you thought about changing, Ferriss most likely touches base on things you can do to improve yourself. I found the read to be very interesting and full of personal experiences and stories, which I thought added extra depth to the book. I both liked and disliked the fact that every chapter was different, so it wasn't a \\"straight-through,\\" read. The diet suggested by Ferriss definitely requires ambition to stick to it, as the slow-carb approach requires you to stay away from bread, dairy, sugar and so on, which can be difficult for some individuals. I am currently on the slow-carb diet, and find that it isn't too bad as long as you eat enough legumes. I am on my third week of the slow-carb diet, and so far I have lost 9 pounds (from 202 lbs down to 193 lbs).
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I've been a fan of the Evangelion series since I was first introduced to it back in the mid 2000's, when I was finally sitting down to watch some old anime shows. While I do agree that the original series ended on a rather less than uplifting note (once I factored in End Of Evangelion), I still thought it was a fascinating series to watch. Imagine my surprise when Gainax announced a series of Rebuild films, made to represent Anno's original vision for the show. I was excited. The first film was more of a retelling of the first 6 episodes of the series, and while it was great to see brand new animation to some of my favorite moments, I felt that it had a been there done that film. The second film, is just absolutely amazing. Dazzling animation, great character moments and humor, and probably one of the more emotional climaxes I've seen in an anime. And this is only the 2nd of 4 movies! This was well worth the price I paid for, and the quality of the Blu-Ray is absolutely stunning. While I could have done without the subtitles translating the songs in the movie, this is nevertheless a fantastic release.
B004V6U7F2|1.0|Usualmnente, materiales nuevos hay que escucharlos mas de una vez para ver si le comienza a entender y gustar a uno la musica y/o concepto, lo he escuchado por la maniana o tarde para eso de con que animos ando, pero no, el disco me parece aburrido, solo dos canciones se salvan, la primera y la 12 del disco. Suena algo a mana pero muy muy monotono.<br />Compren otra cosa... el de Zoe acustico se lo lleva de calle a este.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I've heard Adele for a few years, but never really thought about getting her CD. But once I did, I fell even more in love with her. I was originally drawn in from her first CD, 19, which had songs on it I didn't realize she sung. This CD, 21, is no exception.<br /><br />Rolling in the Deep starts the CD out with a powerful, energetic song making everyone sing along. The power behind her voice is amazing and she's not shy to belt it out.<br /><br />Rumour Has It is the next track which is a catchy song. I was indifferent the first time I listened to it and now, I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />Turning Tables is a bit slower, but it's one of my favorites on the CD. I've been addicted to this song since I've heard it. (The same with Rolling in the Deep) It's so powerful though it's slower.<br /><br />Someone Like You is the ending song and it's a good way to end the CD. It's powerful, soft, beautiful and amazing all wrapped in one.<br /><br />The other songs I don't mind too much, but these are more of my favorite songs. The first time you listen to the CD, you might skip a few songs, but it's worth a second listen. That's what happened with me. Though I love Adele, some of her songs were a bit slower for me and I wasn't in the mood, at the time, to listen to them. Some of them are more of a coffee house or jazz feel to them. But overall, I love this CD. I would recommend it to anyone.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|I am not a game player in general,  but like to have some few on my phone to kill time.  This game made me smile.  Easy to figure out controls,  love the &quot;Southernness&quot; of it being from the south myself.  Also, grandkids wanted to play it.   We have a winner.
1402536038|4.0|I enjoyed the levity over what is in reality a serious problem for many. Rebecca Bloomwood was adorable in this book. She couldn't help over-shopping and tried to talk herself out of it, but invariably talked herself into it. Shopping was ruining her life. Her life was filled with anxiety because there was no foreseeable way to get on top of her bills or stop shopping.     I didn't feel Luke Brandon was a realistic character only because he was such a knight in shining armor to the extent that he was. Rebecca seemed realistic though, and that's what counts. Luke served a purpose in that he got her to use her talents, honed during years of hardcore shopping. The first half of the book was fun when the wonderful solution was not in reach and there was constant suspense.
074356619X|5.0|I purchased this set for my daughter. She found the book at a resale shop and wanted more. I had mentioned it to her about two years ago and she had never heard of it. (She lives in a different city.) She loves it as much as I do. I purchased the DVD when it first came out. The concepts are are agreeable to my spirit and I know she teachers speak Truth.
0439023513|5.0|With two best-selling novels at the front end of the Hunger Games trilogy, author Suzanne Collins had a lot to live up to with the series' final book, \\"Mockingjay\\". Fortunately, she delivers in a big way. If you haven't read \\"Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire\\", turn back now, for what is coming will confuse you.    When we left Katniss Everdeen at the end of \\"Catching Fire\\", she had just been rescued from the Hunger Games and told that her home, District 12, no longer exists. The people of District 13, who had long been thought to have been wiped out in the Dark Days, are alive and helping the other districts rise up and fight a revolution against the Capitol. As a fan favorite in the games and one of the few people to publicly stick it to the Capitol, Katniss has been chosen to be the Mockingjay - the symbol of rebellion and revolution.     Life in District 13 is very different from anything she has known before. They are sticklers for rules, regulations, and every move is planned in advance. Meals are based on the person's build, fitness level, and number of minutes until the next meal. The day's schedule is stamped on your forearm at the beginning of the day with ink that is designed to last long enough until the day's end - and not a minute longer. Strangest of all, the entire district lives underground in a warren of tunnels and mazes.    But Katniss is the Mockingjay, and she must provide strength and insipration to the other districts. Through traveling for television promos that are illegally hacked into Panem's network to fighting in staged events, she is the voice of the people. But missing at her side is her fellow Tribute, Peeta, who was seized by the Capitol at the same time she was rescued. He's alive - but acting strangely. What has the Capitol done to him?    In \\"Mockingjay\\", Collins brings the series to an explosive conclusion. I've seen several reviews that state the reader was disappointed in the ending, and to a certain extent, I can see why. Butin order to fully appreciate this work, you have to look at it as a novel about revolution. In actual wars, tough decisions must be made. Not everyone survives. Life isn't black-and-white and we don't get the stereotypical \\"happy ending\\". These are things that come to the front of Katniss's mind, as she must decide what to do to put the horror of her past behind her - and live for the future.
0061726826|4.0|Another really enjoyable YA title!  This is the story of Lena who always feared love and all of the pain it could bring.  At least until she falls right into it head first!  I absolutely love the concept of love as a disease.  In some ways I can see how that can be true.  It can drive you to the high of all highs and the depths of despair.  It makes you act irrationally at times, saying and doing things completely out of character.  It has the power to build you up and break you down.  I found this story a bit like Matched by Ally Condie.  A young girl who is so certain of what her life will be until a boy comes along that changes her world, opens her eyes to new possibilities and makes her take incredible risks.  I think in part I enjoy these stories because we've all been in those shoes at some point.  It brings back memories of those first moments of holding hands, being vulnerable, the fear of rejection and then the exhiliration when your feelings are returned.  In this case though these first, beautifully written moments are rebellion.  Society is so constrained and repressed that even holding hands or soothing your child when she skins her knee are forbidden.  Everyone else embraces their lack of emotional ties as safety and happiness but Lena slowly learns that there's another option but the consequences for choosing the \\"disease\\" are dire.  Really a great read and of course the end leaves me wanting more right away!
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|My 9 year old son loves this game!  He has Aspergers/Autism so he is quite picky about which games he likes.  This game, however, is one of his favorites.  In this game, one builds themeparks and designs rollercoasters.  Many have posted their finished rollercoasters on YouTube as well as rollercoaster disasters they created using this game.  I'm really glad I purchased this product.
B004X0XA82|2.0|Latest Fleet Foxes is a meandering, meaningless underachievement by a unique group capable of so much.  The title song is marvelous, yes, but nothing else on the collection even comes close.
B00005JMXX|4.0|I really like this movie - I think that the story and the visual effects were done very well, and the actors' execution of the story was good, too. I'd recommend watching this movie to anyone.
B004SBX112|2.0|I bought this app to get rid of the ads, but I still get the stupid pop-up commercials. Wish I could get a refund!
B004YZKKAW|5.0|This is definitely not my 1st Castle and it certainly will not be the last. I truly love the series and all of its characters.<br />The story in 'To Love and Die in L.A.' gave a taste of a past show and it kept it in the present so you didn't have to wonder what happened then. It added a new enticement to the older show and kept it neat and added a story to really finish the older show. It was very well written.<br />Castle and Beckett are still very very close to going to the next romantic level. I hope the writers keep it going up slowly. I love the enticement.<br />The entire cast are all good actors.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I consider this even more underrated than the original 1982 TRON film. This is lovely, eerie, jaw-dropping science fiction adventure that is both agreeable Disney family fare and a stunning futuristic opus. I originally saw this in Bangkok, Thailand, where many Thais don't seem aware that this is a sequel. Some of the imagery recalls some of the 80's and 90's issues of Heavy Metal Magazine. Emotions run higher in this film, and there are great moments which suggest a very strange new human digital evolution to come (in the hoped-for episode 3- please not another 28 years of waiting).    The dvd has great quality, though some may be overwhelmed by the 3-D imagery (especially those light-paths left in the wake of the rushing light cycles). The soundtrack is heavy and fantastically loud, so that you can appreciate the thundering sound FX and Daft Punk's powerful (and also underrated) dance-tech and symphonic film score. By all means buy it- it's a great opportunity to get your multiple versions/editions of this remarkable movie, which I think will pave the way for an evolution in motion pictures. Thanks, Disney, for taking a great chance!
0756404738|5.0|I read book 1 of this trilogy only recently so happily did not have to wait long for book 2. Book 1 was, frankly, brilliant and the best fantasy book that I have read for ages (if ever). Book 2 is also excellent. I agree with some of the other reviews in that there are a few sections that are a little long. However, I don't think they detract from the overall quality of the writing.    Personally, I think it is refreshing that the hero, Kvothe, has dark aspects to his personality rather than being the classic \\"whiter than white\\" hero. I think the character development in this second instalment is great, and was so swept up in the book that I didn't even notice the lack of furtherance of the main plot line that has been mentioned in other reviews. Does it really matter? Surely it's more important to have a wonderful, absorbing, entertaining story.     Thank you Mr Rothfuss    Encore, please :)
1594202842|4.0|Please read the review posted by Jared Zyglinsky.  He hit the nail right on the head (and wrote it much better than I could have).
B004X0XA82|5.0|I have enjoyed the fleet foxes since I discovered them 2 years ago. They are one of the few bands that has effected me so strongly.<br /><br />This album is both very faithful to the band's sound, and yet not a single song has the same feel or point. The title track is quite good, but after one listen, I think all of the songs are as good or better.  The wait was worth it for me. I hope the fleet foxes continue to lead my life with their music!

0553381695|3.0|[[ASIN:0553381695 A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 2)]]    For fear of giving away too much, I'll be vague:  The ending of the battle disappointed me.  I came away feeling that the author gave up on a thread introduced early in the book ( the Red Priest and the Shadow Assasin).  The book still kept me on my toes; must have read the book within three days. The characters, Jon Snow and Danny does not hold much interest for me however.
0316069353|5.0|This is exactly what you want and expect from Michael Connelly.  A riveting read that passes all too quickly and leaves you hunting for something else that you can consume with such vigor and intensity with so little care or bother while doing so.  Connelly's Lincoln Lawyer series are wonderful diversions, highly intelligent and engrossing but they don't make you work too hard.  I felt that this book gave me a great insight into behind the scenes machinations of a courtroom and at the same time there is a sneaky tugging at your emotions by a character you feel real empathy for even though he's a bit of a SOB.      Will buy anything Connelly writes until he disappoints me.  Hasn't happened yet.      By the way....the bad reviews because of Kindle pricing are really not helpful. I wish people would find another way to protest these things rather than ruining review scores for good pieces of work.  This book deserves a 4 star rating because it's not a great piece of writing....just a fun novel but I gave it 5 stars to help balance the BS a bit.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Works great, lots of options for waking up.  Only con is that it will disconnect you if you hit snooze to quite an alarm during a call.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|In as brief a way as I can state - this album is R.E.M.s \\"No Line on the Horizon.\\" In that I mean it is absolutely fantatstic! I'm 49 and I've been listening to R.E.M as I've listened to U2, since I was in my early twenties, and both albums I've named have been both panned and praised, but both albums blew me away like the first time I'd heard either band. Just the opposite of the naysayers, I didn't think either band had it left in them to surprise me. I have \\"Collapse\\" in the CD player next to \\"Murmer.\\" Now I need to leave just those two in and put the player on shuffle. I'm feeling younger already!

B00003CXCT|1.0|I grew up on Star Wars.  I used to defend George Lucas.  I've owned the original Star Wars trilogy on no less than 3 different formats (VHS, Laserdic, DVD) and have several fan edits at my disposal.  To say I'm an original trilogy Star Wars nerd is taking it lightly.    So when Lucas decided to clean up the films shot by shot, to present the most pristine print of Star Wars possible, I was enthused.  With hopes that he would present the trilogy in its best form yet, I could forgive him for making *some* of the changes in the 1997 re-release.  Shots of outside vistas as Leia hurries to intercept Boba Fett in Cloud City are fine.  I can forgive him for painting those in.    But this release is a travesty.  Between Tarkin's screwed up audio on the line \\"Then name the system!\\", the audio engineers eliminating the trumpeting brass as the X-wings plunge down to the surface of the Death Star, Luke's wussie scream as falls into the bowels of Cloud City, don't get me started.  Not to mention Han and Greedo's fight, Anakin's ghost, etc, etc.  The list goes on and on.    DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.    Admit defeat and wait patiently until either George comes to his senses, or dies.  Then we can get the version of Star Wars we want.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I already owned this in VHS but wanted it in DVD.  I hae seen this show on broadway 4 times and it is still my favorite play.  Excellent show!

0763644765|5.0|My daughter loves this book. It's easy to read/understand and the board pages are a must for my 19mo old. After reading the book, she wants to sit on her potty! The only kinda bad thing is that my daughter thinks the baby looks like a monkey! LOL
B004P29FSW|5.0|Just got this limited edition double vinyl lp and it sounds fantastic. Includes the 22 tracks that the cd comes with plus 7 other \\"bonus\\" tracks. The sleeve is really cool looking and is numbered on the back (mine is 5063/9072, so guessing this is limited to less than 10k units!).    The insert that has the download code is a large sheet with some quotes from Steven Lisberger and Joseph Kosinski. Just a heads up for any Americans that buy this lp and try to get the digital copy, make SURE you put that you are in the United Kingdom when filling out the information, or else it wont let you download the tracks. That part sucks as well, you have to download each one individually which was tedious, but not really a problem since it was free. It doesnt include the 7 bonus tracks that are on the lp, just the main 22 tracks from the cd soundtrack.     Overall I am very pleased with this soundtrack now that I finally have it, anyone looking to put up the limited edition vinyl should definitely do so!
B0034U27PE|1.0|Seller took full responsibility for book that arrived with a black ink strip on the pages and promptly authorized a refund.  This kind of integrity is rare and appreciated.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Great movie - nothing that I can add to the hundreds of reviews that are out here.  However, technically the blu-ray disc itself should not have even one star.  The movie is fine, the video quality superb, but the architecture that underlies the movie and the 'bonus features' absolutely bites.  The menu key on any of my players will not take you back to the menu - it starts over at the previews.  There's something wrong with how the disc is designed, and it's frustrating as all heck to try to get to the menu to turn on subtitles, etc. if you want them.  You are forced to fast forward through the previews to get to the main menu.  Annoying, especially given the surcharge for blu-ray discs in general.  Ahhh - the price we pay for better technology.    Movie is brilliant - loved it in the theatre, loved it at home.. Just think they could have put a bit more effort into the overall design of the disc menu system.    Thanks!

B004XWLN20|5.0|I think that season 10 of Smallville was absolutely amazing.It will be amazing to have the complete series and being able to watch Smallville whenever and wherever I want.In my opinion the show's got a lot better and more entertaining in seasons 8,9 and 10.The best episodes of the season,in my opinion, were Icarus and Isis.I will certainly have this complete set when it releases.It is a perfect set!The original copy of The Daily Planet newspaper is awesome!And It also has all the extras included in each single season dvd set.I recommend you to buy it if you're a Smallville fan.
0316078913|5.0|Folks, this is one of my favorite reads.<br /><br />David Sedaris says he doesn't do readings from it anymore b/c it \\"reads aloud\\" a bit choppily.<br /><br />All I know is that this little book made me giggle from beginning to end. Usual for Mr Sedaris' work.
0756404738|3.0|I usually don't write a review when I have not yet finished the book. But I am bogged down in the Felurian section. The book started to fall apart for me when I arrived at the Maer section. Up to that time I was enamored of the tale: just as good as book one though with little development of character. I am pretty much skipping the section I'm in to see what might happen to the star. Basically the book is MUCH too long and lots of it should have been edited out. I'll reserve my opinion 'til the end but I feel several hundred pages should have been cut so far.    After finishing the book (most of it anyway) I found out that you cannot enter another review of the book you had already reviewed. So I just wanted to add this. I still think Rothfuss is a fine writer but one who needs some reigning in and the editor could have done this. Still mostly find his characters most enjoying and while I look forward to the last volume, I wonder if I'll live long enough! I'm in my 70's.

1932100660|1.0|I was looking for a plan for proper eating without excessive protein, being a plant based diet.  All I received were scientific studies which did not help me at all.  I kept trying to scan through it, being on a kindle that was difficult, and finally just put it down without any desire to pick it back up.
044654759X|3.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down. Then the last 3 pages ruined it.  Read it and tell me if you disagree.    (later - after reading the other reviews, I probably enjoyed it because I've never seen Sleeping with the Enemy. And the first part is slow, but it does have a really good section going on in the middle)
142311339X|4.0|I learned about Mythology as a Freshmen in High School, which was a long time ago.  I did not read the Percy Jackson series but watched the movie.  So when I listened to this book on a Playaway, I was hoping I would be able to follow it.  Surprisingly, it was.  My mythology was slowly coming back and I knew enough about Percy that I didn't feel lost.  This book is about Jason, Piper and Leo.  Percy will probably be in the later books.  Jason has no memory of who he is and just appeared at a school with Piper and Leo.  But it is found out that their memories of him were manufactured by a mist.  How could something that feels so real not be? As in the other books by Rick Riordan, there is a quest.  A quest that involves our 3 heroes, Jason Piper and Leo.  They will discover who they really are and hopefully save the day.    There are villains, battles and friendship. There is romance, humor and heart.  I listened to the playaway and wasn't thrilled with the voice that read.  But getting passed that, I really liked the book and can't wait to read or listen to the next one.  I think hearing it got me past trying to remember how to pronounce the various gods and monsters names if I had read it instead.  After reading this book, I'm seriously thinking about reading  Percy's adventures too.
B004L9KLXC|4.0|I was afraid this book would turn into an erotic Pride and Prejudice with drawn out subplot and hollow or pretentious characters. They were pretentious but I felt a kinship with each. The social life a wealthy person often experiences in this age is cut down to a few essentials and the characters are well chiseled so they are simple to track. The erotic scenes were surprisingly tame or cut short. There was far more philosophy about life, people, and sex than I anticipated. I enjoyed these sections as much as the sex, though for different reasons. The eroticism is more based on the uncomfortable moments of being naked together or initiating sex. These awkwardly unfolding moments gave a sense of realism mostly gone from modern erotica.
9889979942|5.0|I've been living in China for more than half a decade and can genuinely say this is a really enjoyable book that gives a face to the millions of unknown people across China. I've traveled pretty extensively here and reading Tom's book I'm often reminded of my own experiences, both good and bad, reflected in his journey. From the diversity of people encountered to the often entertaining anecdotes of his travels, there's a sense of open-hearted honesty in the way he presents this wonderful collection of images and his experience as a whole.    We hear daily about the rise of China and its rapid-fire development but this is just one part of the big picture and every day more than 1.3 billion people are simply going about their daily lives, lives that are each unique in their own way and fascinating to discover. From Shanghai to Xinjiang and everything in between, this is a complicated country with many, many different faces. Luckily for us, in his two-year trip Tom managed to capture some of them on film, offering sinophiles and armchair travelers alike a window to the world that exists beyond the Great Wall and international headlines--they say a picture paints a thousand words so next time I go home and someone asks, \\"So what is China really like?\\" I may just keep my mouth shut and hand them a copy of this book.     - Aimee Groom
1402573723|4.0|This book didn't blow my mind or make me rethink my life. However, it did provide a great comparison in ideas and customs of my own culture and what is often generically referred to as \\"African.\\" At moments I blinked and felt a small idea brand itself in my head much like the first time I thought of wild animals having personalities. I've often thought of Africa as a single entity of people that have found a simpler way of living and yet believe in silly gods. My introduction to questions against religion have since sent me down the road that many ideas I've followed or known are silly and unfounded; including the bias against tribesmen.<br /><br />I realize how blatant and racist the above sounds but I don't feel I'm alone or particularly wrong for thinking so. When something has only a passing affect on your life you don't normally devote a lot of time to clearing up the general ideas used to define it. So goes my spacious clearing of old ideas with the new ones provided in this book. Thank you, sir.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I am grateful to the recommendation by J.R. Ward to get this book....Thea Harrison is one talented author that has created an urban fantasy world that will singe your socks off!  I fell in love with the dark hero, Drago, a dragon who has never loved; and with Pia, the halfling who is running for her life<br />while searching for the dream of finding love and safety at long last.  The story of their fate is well told and with a beautiful balance of sensuality, action, humor and great attention to detail on world building of the Elder Races.<br /><br />My only regret is that it will be August before the next book in the Elder Races comes out, Storm's Heart, which I will be pre-ordering!  Kudos to a magnificent book by a very gifted author.  Highly recommended!
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Perfect balance of comedy, thought, and emotion. I loved every element that made this movie. They definitely picked the right actor for each character. Just an awesome movie.
0805080120|5.0|The Unfolding of Language provides a cursory, but informative, synopsis of the processes by which the different elements of our languages may have developed. The book is very informative for those interested in how complex phrases, expressions and structures might have arisen in a myriad of languages, but will provide little information history and geographic underpinnings of these developments. If anyone were to have a suggestion on where I could better inform myself upon these topics, I'd be much obliged.
0307272702|1.0|This book is so wrong dont even bother to read it. He places the whole emphasis on diet and bases nothing on how we are brought up from childfren. Fat kids fat adults. If you send you children into adulthood lean and fit then they will not become fat...unhealthy maybe but not fat. His misuse of scientifc arguments and information is also wrong.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I haven't actually watched the DVD, but, I did see the the movie at the theatre...I HEARD of Christine Aqualara? but, didn't really KNOW what she did--I thought she was fantastic--her voice is beautiful...as for Cher, I've always been a fan, and went to see the movie because she was in it--also, why I bought it--you can't go wrong with Cher--always entertaining for many, many, years, and hope she will continue in some capacity for the next forty or so years!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I'd never heard of this HBO series until recently.  I bought it almost immediately and after watching it, I must say I'm impressed.  I have the signature edition which is in widescreen.  I notice some people are upset that the original 4:3 aspect ratio was altered to 16:9, but having never seen the original 4:3 version, I don't see any faults.  The image is very crisp and sharp.  Most people have widescreen TVs now, and I much prefer widescreen images.      This series (mini-series) was produced by Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and Brian Grazer.  So this is the same bunch that put together 'Apollo 13'.  Anything with Ron Howard's and Tom Hank's name on it are always quaility product, and this is no exception.  This show is based on real people and real events, but it is not a documentary, so why people are complaining about this is beyond me.      I grew up during this era, and the NASA space program was always a shining example of technology and progress.  I remember the awe and wonder of these actual events, and the inspiration it gave me.  Its not a story of nations at war or other human on human competition which seems to be what nearly all history is.  It is a story of human ingenuity, intelligence, cooperation, exploration and risk.  People at their best.
1416955070|3.0|It took me a long time to fall into the pages of `City Of Bones' much longer than I thought it would considering all the hype about it. For a lot of the novel I felt like I was just skimming the surface because I couldn't get any deeper, it simply wouldn't let me fall into it but I continued on, determined to reach the last page. I believe that what put me off was the huge amount of over share on detail, I would finally start getting it to it only to find myself crashing into a brick wall of detail that went in one ear and out the other with a sigh. This book probably should have been shorter and without the constant rush of detail that really wasn't needed.<br /><br />Also I don't know about you but City of Bones kept reminding me of the TV series `Sanctuary'. From the secret building masked by illusions to keep it hidden; to the safe house it was to those in need, to the protectors that were named the Shadowhunter's in City of Bones. Anyway you get the point, it reminded me of an episode of `Sanctuary' and I really like Sanctuary' so that didn't bother me too much, just the occasional `hey this reminds me of `Sanctuary'.<br /><br />The characters were well written and I never felt that ho hum where the hell did they come from thinking mode; it was well rounded and if we hadn't already heard their name they had already been somewhat explained. I loved Clary's fiery attitude, a strong heroine is always exciting to read about which is probably why I stuck at it, determined to finish. Jace was, well he was Jace; nothing more or less to say about him other than `yum'. Simon was amusing to me, I really liked him `Go Simon' and Alec, well I love that name and was a bit disappointed when the character was a bit ahem, rude but by the end he came out as just a protective guy of those he loved and somewhat afraid of them knowing his secret sexuality because shadowhunter's aren't always the accepting type so I forgave him of his misdeeds (this isn't a spoiler, it is totally obvious).<br /><br />There is still a lot to be uncovered and I will continue on with the series with the hope that the next one has more fire than detail. I have high hopes because the last hundred pages of City of Bones kept me completely hooked.<br /><br />Oh and P.S. I want to kick Valentines Ass; just sayin.<br /><br />SHE KNOWN AS JESSere is still a lot to be uncovered and I will continue on with the series with the hope that the next one has more fire than detail.

0525423273|5.0|I loved it from the start, grew attached to it in the middle and became infatuated with it by the end. I love the way Stephanie Perkins writes; seriously that woman knows what to do with the words in her mind and how to bring out the gold in sentences! Nothing, not a single moment feels forced, it all flows together in a lovely dance that keeps your focus. You know when some dances, acts or when something is pronounced in a particular way that captivates your attention and you cannot stare away even if you truly need too, not that you'd want too.<br /><br />The romance between Anna and St. Clair simmered and stirred for a length of time, it blends, ravels, climbs, burns, lingers and unravels around them, looping around them in a sense of security; one they aren't ready to accept. I love how Perkins takes the slow approach because in reality romances don't just blink in from nowhere, well some do but they are quick to sizzle out as fast as they come but Anna and St. Clair's romance is able to develop into something deeper, something more profound in its beauty. I love that their weakness are brought to the surface where they can discover each other on another level instead of the usual, `I like you, your hot' scene that we often read about in books.<br /><br />There is nothing more than I can say without squealing like a two year old who has been shown something shiny but I will leave you with this; Stephenie Perkins is an author to look out for, if her next novel is as good as this debut, she is going to be gold.<br /><br />P.s. I VOTE FOR A SEQUEL! Come' on the college years, bring it on!! More Anna and Etienne; super please!<br /><br />SHE KNOWN AS JESS
B004XQO90E|4.0|\\"Source Code\\" Duncan Jones' (you know David Bowie's son)latest science fiction thriller continues to make good on the promise of \\"Moon\\".<br /><br />While \\"Source Code\\" may sound like a more serious version of \\"Groundhog Day\\" (which may or may not have found inspiration in a short story by author Richard Lupoff that had the same premise as both films). While quite a good film the premise has its limitations and flaws; the character played by Michelle Monaghan isn't really well developed because we get to see so little of her in those eight minutes that are repeated like an endless loop.

Was the result a combination of his memories/personality (much like in \\"Quantum Leap\\" and, interestingly, Scott Bakula plays our hero's dad on the phone)or did he obliterate the teacher he inhabited?

B004LL1HM4|4.0|I enjoyed the first album, so I didn't hesitate to buy this when it came out, especially at the download price of $3.99, what a steal! The title song is awesome, and as a whole I think I enjoyed this album more than the first one. It seems to me that the melodies stand out more, maybe they toned down the 'echo-ish' effect that the first one had, this is especially noticeable on \\"Blue-Spotted Tail,\\" which is a beautiful song with the singer's voice being heard almost intimately, with the guitar strumming in the background in the beginning.    I also really liked the instrumental \\"Cascades,\\" and I like the overall feel of \\"Sim Sala Bim\\" and \\"Bedouin Dress,\\" as well the way the song \\"Grown Ocean\\" makes me feel like I'm on a road trip. I will say this though, what the heck is up with the end of \\"The Shrine / An Argument\\"?! It's a cool song that I was enjoying, but lo and behold, in the last minute of the song, you're bombarded by noises of saxophones and other instruments in a seemingly chaotic fashion, I didn't like that. one. bit. Minus one star! Still love ya, FF.
B0044RUSZM|3.0|I like using these stands on desks, but I hate moving them. They cannot be moved as a whole, as the pieces will disassemble themselves and fall onto anything -- your toes, your iPhone, your hardwood table -- and bruise/shatter/dent them. Two of three of those have happened to me in my 4 years of ownership, and the guy at the Apple store said mine wasn't the first phone with a shattered screen courtesy the Griffin Elevator he'd seen; his own broke that way.<br /><br />The overall shape and grips I have no complaint about, but this is a fundamentally flawed product.

B00009Z576|4.0|I grew up with Yes. Rick Wakeman, Jon Anderson, Squire, Howe, Buford and White. I loved the early albums, but the band was growing stale. They had released the lackluster Tormato, which seemed like the death knoll of this band.     When I heard that Yes was joining forces with \\"The Buggles\\", and without Anderson, to say I was skeptical would have been an understatement. Much to my supprise this was, and still is, one of my favorite albums. Tempus Fugit, Run Through the Light & Into the Lens breathed a new spark into my old favorite band and made them seem new and exciting again. Although this lineup didn't last (although they evolved into Asia), the spirit of this release lived on in 90125's Owner of a Lonely Heart.
B000XUBC5E|4.0|Coben is one of those reliable types--interesting characters, good plot, not too much confusion, but not overly challenging either. But he doesn't waste your time.
0061726826|5.0|Oliver's writing is just so skilled and beautiful. I kept finding myself marvelling at various paragraphs and sentences.  She definitely makes a lot of the other YA authors out there look like amateurs.  Anyway, I just finished the book so I'm still sinking it all in but I think I can safely say that it's probably the most genuine love story I've ever read.  I think a lot of YA romance or even adult romance can seem extremely contrived.  However, I believed in the two characters (Alex and Lena).  Oliver doesn't make me feel icky with corny lines and contrived situations.  Instead, she makes the romance unfold nicely and naturally.  And the interaction between the two characters is so sweet and relatable.  I'm very excited to see where Oliver takes this story in the second book.

B0048LPRCS|5.0|ENTER THE VOID takes us along for the ultimate trip. No drug on earth could possibly match the effects of death and the soul's flight from the body. Gaspar Noe (IRREVERSIBLE) uses his entire bag of cinematic tricks to enable us to experience Oscar's \\"out-of-body / into the beyond\\" adventure. We are given the back-story about what led up to Oscar's tragic demise via flashback in spurts and jolts, allowing us to piece things together. Make no mistake, this is a true Noe film, complete w/ violence (though nowhere near as much as in his other movies), disturbing / numbing sexual situations (in the LOVE HOTEL for instance, where sexual intercourse is like vulgar wallpaper), and perverse characters. What sets ETV apart is it's more hopeful, downright sunny (for Noe) sense of renewal, rebirth, and life after death. Hell, after seeing this, I just might read THE BOOK OF THE DEAD for myself! Highly recommended for those NOT easily offended...

B001P3OMY6|3.0|The book catered to us Pride and Prejudice fans, so that was fun.  The characters were enjoyable.  Shannon Hale is a talented writer.  But I was just bored through most of the book.  I never really got pulled into the story.  The story, of course, mirrors that of P&P, though it is far more silly: single 30s woman is obsessed with P&P, her great aunt gives her a trip to an Austen-era resort, she fools around with an inappropriate guy who isn't what he seems, only to fall for the stiff, serious Darcy-like character.  Yeah, there's some personal growth and whatnot, but it's mostly just P&P indulgence.  Like I said, fun--but not spectacular.

B004EPYZQC|4.0|The Fast and the Fiveous is a high octane thrill ride that speeds along at a frantic pace, leaving plot and character in the dust. But that's ok, because all we care about is who wins the race. The movie gets into gear with the opening scene and never lets up. Sure, it's low quality. I know, the writing is bad and the characters' choices make no sense. And yes, watching Vin Diesel try to smile is a painful experience. But in the end, you'll find the whole thing stupidly entertaining.<br /><br />In fact, it was so stupid that my brain sort of shut off while I was watching and I'm having serious trouble coming up with anything useful to say. Did I already mention that Vin Diesel fights The Rock? Basically, if that sounds good to you, you're gonna love this movie. Otherwise, steer clear. But if you feel like reading on, be warned that my mind is not firing on all six cylinders. Five Fast Five Furious picks up where the last one left off (as if anyone's keeping track), with Dom (Vin Diesel) in jail. It takes all of 30 seconds for some stunt driving to flip the prison transport bus he's on, sending Dom twirling towards freedom--and man does it flip, over and over and over and over, until it comes to its final resting place. Boom: title screen. What an opening. Though there were only 6 people in the theater, it immediately filled with cheers. The movie must have anticipated my fear for all those poor prisoners' lives, for shortly after the title, we get a news report assuring us that no one was harmed. Dom and co. would never hurt an innocent prisoner.<br /><br />From there, we launch into a kickass train sequence with all sorts of fighting and stunts that would leave the main characters dead a dozen times over (I'm looking at you, 500 foot fall off a cliff). But who cares? It's awesome! That's sort of the theme of Fiveous in case you hadn't noticed. Unlike Source Code, which fails because it tries to be smart but is instead riddled with errors, this movie succeeds with flying colors. It tries to be dumb, so we watch it on its own terms, accepting everything that doesn't make sense.<br /><br />For example, the characters are totally weak and one-note. Doesn't matter how many cops Vin Diesel kills. He's not a bad guy. He just loves his sister and gets put in tough situations. We feel so much empathy for that dude. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) isn't just a cop who turned against the force and became a car-stealing criminal. No, he's a guy with a wife. How can you not feel for him? Especially when his wife is extra hot. She is, after all, the lovely Jordana Brewster. She doesn't do a whole lot, but not only does she have an amazing body, but also she's pregnant. Gotta care about her if she's got a baby in her belly. The characters make all sorts of irrational decisions and have no depth, but they're exactly good enough.<br /><br />The cops are even worse though. Dwayne Johnson's motivations are all over the place, and his sexy partner lets her lust for Vin Diesel's muscles get in the way of her job time and again. In another film, these might be problems, but in Five Furious, everything's already so ridiculous we just don't mind. Like I said, we get to see Vin Diesel fight The Rock. That's all I need, and it's probably the highlight of the movie. My friends and I kept shouting \\"Ohhhh\\" when someone would land a particularly devastating blow (which happened like every other punch). I'm pretty sure the other 3 members of the audience were as into it as we were.<br /><br />When people weren't fighting or smashing things, the movie did start drag, however, and not the race sort of drag. Every once in a while I'd catch myself actually listening to the dialogue, which was a big mistake, because I'd overhear things like this: There's a basically uncharacterized Hot Girl repairing part of a car or something. The also uncharacterized Asian Guy walks up and says: \\"You really like doing that stuff, huh?\\" Hot Girl thinks a normal response to that question might be something along the lines of: \\"When your life is on the line--that's when you learn about yourself.\\" Then Asian Guy says: \\"That's a fair deal.\\" Deal? What deal? Are these people even talking to each other? The exchange makes absolutely no sense, which apparently gets Hot Girl off, cause next she flashes this overly flirtatious look, followed by a cut away. What a beautiful scene. But heck, when the two of them hook up while driving at the end of the film (very dangerous. do not recommend), I was happy for them. Why not?<br /><br />Why not? I'm pretty sure that's what the screenwriter must've said whenever someone questioned one of his scenes. But it works! I mean, this is an action movie first and foremost. Whether or not it's a good film boils down to one thing: how much did it kick ass? The answer to that question, my friends, is A Lot. I mean, Dom literally rips a 20 ton bank vault out of a wall. Before this movie, if you'd ask me how many times I could be entertained by seeing a giant bank vault smash a cop car while being dragged along the street chained to two sleek racing vehicles, I'd probably have said four or five times. But now I  know the truth. It's dozens and dozens of times. Scores of times! Vault smash this car. Vault smash that car. Vault smash one car. Vault smash two cars. I think the movie actually states that the vault smashes every single cop car in all of Rio. A very impressive feat by anyone's standards, to be sure.<br /><br />There ya go. Fast Five is pretty awesome. Shut off your brain and turn on your, I dunno, eyes? If you go to this expecting B-grade entertainment, you'll have a great time. Fast Five does a surprisingly good job of keeping up the excitement at all times, and as long as you don't listen to the dialogue, there won't be a single dull moment.<br /><br />3.5/5 ¢<br /><br />Was anyone else constantly afraid that Mia might have a miscarriage when she was jumping off of roofs and crashing through windows and flying around hairpin turns?<br /><br />Check out more reviews on thenickelscreenes of: \\"When your life is on the line--that's when you learn about yourself.\\" Then Asian Guy says: \\"That's a fair deal.\\" Deal?

B00127RAJY|4.0|I purchased the 30 Day Shred about a year after having my first child.  I had only worked out sporadically a few times since his birth and was still a bit larger than before pregnancy.  This DVD has been wonderful.  You don't need much (small handweights) and I can do it while my son naps.  Each workout (3 different levels) is only about 25 minutes and has me sweating (sometimes dripping) by the end.  I started in January, stopped for a few weeks due to medical issue, but since end of March (1 1/2 months) I have been doing this DVD not everyday, but close.  Since I began in January I have lost about 10 or more pounds, and I am almost a full size smaller than pre-pregnancy.  I can tell my muscles are getting more tone and I fell healthier.  I have only done level three a few times even.  I still have trouble with a few exercises (ie: real push-ups) but the results and the way I feel moivate me to keep going.  I have rotated in a new Jillian Michaels DVD to add variety (Boost Metabollism).  I would definitely recommend this DVD to the person who wants to get in shape, doesn't need an hour-long workout, and is willling to put work into it.  It may be not for the huge fitness guru who may want a little more.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|This was purchased for me as a gift from my beloved......Its a wonderful CD and Stevie does it again!! =) So happy
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I remember watching this movie as a child when it was first on TV.  It had such an impact on me that I sought it out as an adult.  The DVD is nothing special.  There are no extra features - just the ability to play and choose chapters.  The picture has not been enhanced, but I don't know how that works or if it even can be.  So the picture is a bit grainy, but there's nothing wrong with that if you don't mind watching it in its original format.  It's a good movie if you saw it when it was originally released, but most people who haven't seen it yet will probably be disappointed by the picture and the story since the basic premise has been copied and improved upon so many times.  But it's wonderful for a trip down memory lane!
0316098329|2.0|When I began to read this book, the dialogue lost me and it is very diffcult to read especially if you are a stickler for correct spelling and grammar, however,  it seemed to be an interesting book when I picked it up. However, the book really disappointed me so I sped read it and will not read anything by this author again. I think it was a dull read and the reader will probably lose interest after the middle of the book.

B004UC1WN8|3.0|Jennifer Lopez has needed a hit for a long time.  Her last album, Brave, didn't make any impact whatsoever (which is a real shame...that album was actually really good).  Mrs. Lopez then attempted to make a comeback with hip-hop singles \\"Louboutins\\" and \\"Fresh Out The Oven\\", both of which were met with scathing reviews from critics and profound indifference from the public.  In a wise move, Lopez scratched those songs from her catalog and went to find some popular producers to help her on what would become her Love? album.  The result is a very upbeat and danceable album that has J.Lo treading new territory for her.  This in itself is good, but the result is still mindless, generic, forgettable pop music.  The album isn't totally bad, however.  Several songs will have you dancing, but you won't find anything that breaks the mold that's been firmly cast by the Britneys, Rihannas and Ke$has of the world.    First single, \\"On The Floor\\" (which heavily samples Kaoma's \\"Lambada\\"), does a fine enough job of showing off the direction of the album.  What follows from that is a collection of hit-or-miss songs.  The more impressive songs are those that feature production from RedOne and have that pop/dance sound.  \\"On The Floor\\", \\"Papi\\", \\"Invading My Mind\\", \\"Hypnotico\\" and \\"Charge Me Up\\" are the highlights of the album by far.  In particular, \\"Invading My Mind\\" and \\"Hypnotico\\" are the two stellar stand-out tracks, both of which happen to be written and/or produced by none other than Lady Gaga.  \\"Hypnotico\\" needs to be a single...this song is absolutely fantastic and is Love?'s absolute shining moment.    Other songs come close to being great.  \\"Until It Beats No More\\" benefits from some stellar production which transforms the song from a run-of-the-mill love song into a groovy number with a great beat.  Unfortunately, Lopez' voice just cannot carry this song (I can see someone like Leona Lewis making this song a classic).  J.Lo's vocal shortcomings are also evident in \\"Starting Over\\" and \\"Villain\\", which sound noisy and disheveled.  Among the album's worst moments are \\"Good Hit\\", which is an embarrassing autotune overkill number, and \\"I'm Into You\\" which has probably the most elementary writing making it sound like a broken record...plus Lil Wayne does the song no favors.    While this album is decent, overall it's not as strong as her other albums, such as This Is Me...Then, Rebirth or Brave.  I hope it does well, and with some good decisions on her label's part it could yield some big hits for Mrs. Lopez.  But really it's just your typical, generic pop album.
B0006J28BO|5.0|This movie is basically the follow up from \\"Whisper of the Heart\\", it still good even if you haven't seen the first of the set. I story young and old will appreciate and love. A must have to complete your Studio Ghibli Collection.
B00007KWI9|2.0|I have what I think is the remastered version of this cd but not the one with the extra tracks. I'd  be even more reluctant to buy this cd because it doesn't have the great photo of the band in the   cemetary. I absolutely love that photo. I think I have a vinyl copy of this album as well. As for the  remastered cd, it is just fine with me. I wouldn't mind hearing the extra tracks but I don't really feel  like forking out more money just for some bonus tracks. Perhaps the cover photo is the English version  which was the first version. Whatever the case, I dig the cemetray photo. The black, blue and pink YES   in a dialogue bubble is ok, but I'd rather love at the band and the awesome gravestones in the cemetary.  Overall this album is quite good. I listen to it often. It is very pure. Time and a Word is in the same vein  but a lot noisier and more experimental. Both are essential albums for any fan of Yes.
0793518326|5.0|First a couple of comments on common complaints:<br /><br />Yes, the print is small, but there is a reason for this that far outweighs the inconvenience:  if it was larger the book would have been<br />  1) longer, probably larger (dimensions), and likely twice as expensive, and<br />  2) some of the context as how the various instruments harmonized/related, etc. would have been lost (as in you would have had to flip between pages much more than you do now).<br /><br />Having said that, there probably will be times you'll call down evil upon the publishers for the small print, have to break out the reading and/or magnifying glasses, copiers and scanners, but overall I think it was a good compromise.<br /><br />\\"Soiled\\" with musically illiterate guitar tab.  Again, there is a reason the publisher did this:<br /> 1) to appeal to a broad audience and have that audience (both musically literate and non-literate) appreciate the full musical talents of the Beatles and others involved in these songs.<br /> 2) There are some things, particularly with electric guitar, that are difficult or impossible to indicate in traditional musical notation.<br /><br />As far as accuracy, I can't speak on that, although few if any of these types of books are 100% accurate.  For most of us, I think it is close enough to help us appreciate what was involved in writing and recording the songs, and to have fun playing them.<br /><br />Bottom line: you won't be able to take this book and a group of musicians and recreate Sargent Pepper's note-for-note; however, you will appreciate the talents of the Beatles more and have fun playing their music.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|Over the decades I have kept up with Nick's career ( though I was a die hard MAC fan ) but had honestly thought her best years were behind her as her albums came fewer and further between..let alone an obvious absence from today's radio climate.     THEN COMES THIS!     \\"In Your Dreams\\" took me totally by surprise. All of the elements that made Nicks a rock and roll legend to begin with are here yet she moves  fast forward. A rock singer in their 60's cannot stay artistically true by remaining pigeon holed to one partular theme or style.    Stevie is older and wiser and it shows here...and despite living the R&R lifestyle throughout most of her career, she remains not only a beauty, but a creatively viable artist...earning her right to record what she damned well pleases.    This album is a solid body of work with no throway tracks.    Nicks really shines on all the cuts and elements of the past are evident but she clearly is moving on. The only negative reviews will come from those who are living in the past.       Stewart, Ballard and Campbell manage to bring her music back into the forefront and I believe hardcore and casual fans will get newly reaquainted with their old love.

0307887960|2.0|Well I have tried to read this book on several attempts and it has not inspired me in anyway to even fathom to begin this so called new diet fad. In a nut shell it reminded me of the Atkins Diet, plain and simple. Now for the not so simple part..too much work. I found it was too much work. There are four various stages of the diet beginning with the \\"Attack Phase\\" which lasts for approximately 5 days. The diet then moves on to three other stages which are the cruise phase (where you would incorporate dairy and cheeses) , the consolidation phase (eating all foods in the attack phase and adding vegetables)and the stabilization phase (plan for life). Seriously folks , who can live like this for the rest of our lives? Dukan does write about incorporating exercise daily and discusses issue such as women with menopause, how to quit smoking without putting on weight and simple ways to lose weight such as taking showers at 77 degrees to lose an easy 100 calories. Believe me there are more items discussed in this book that I really did not find to be anything new. MSNBC reported that France's National Agency for Food, Environmental and Work Health Safety names it as one of 15 diets that are potentially risky. The British Dietetic Association doesn't think much of it either, naming it as one five worst diets of 2011.<br />This diet is short term and eventually people do gain the weight back and then some. Why are we constantly buying and reading books such as this when we can eat what we want but be mindful with portion control and exercise even if it is a leisurely walk anything to get moving. We all know that a healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds a week and there may be times that we gain an extra pound a week in the process. It is a slow process to loss weight in a healthy manner. There are no quick fixes. This is what Dukan represents and its unhealthy.<br /><br />Sorry folks but this book to me will just be a dust collector right next to Atkins.

0761536434|3.0|Former video game reviewer Steven Kent wrote this rollicking history of the video game industry: the companies that made the games, and the people--which is to say, with very few exceptions, the men--behind the companies.<br /><br />It's a little dry at times but better overall than the sloppy and jocular [[ASIN:0307463559 All Your Base Are Belong to Us: How Fifty Years of Videogames Conquered Pop Culture]]. More than 500 interviews gave Kent tons of quotes and plenty of historical context. Again, this book is more about the people than the games themselves. You won't get much insight into gameplay and you won't get more than one or two photos of games in the entire book, period. The title may therefore seem misleading to some readers. On the plus side, there's lots of detail on legal proceedings and what transpired behind the scenes to get the games to market, or in some cases, to keep them off the shelves. If you want a history of games themselves, Kent is the first to suggest Leonard Herman's [[ASIN:0964384825 Phoenix: The Fall & Rise of Videogames]]. For a tasty visual retrospective, try my own favorite, [[ASIN:0762409371 Arcade Fever: The Fan's Guide To The Golden Age Of Video Games]].<br /><br />As for The Ultimate History of Video Games, it's a HUGE book: almost six hundred pages--with wide margins, in all fairness--in the Prima Publishing First Edition. Published in 2001, this will obviously not reflect the last ten years of gaming. Still, the meat of Kent's many interviews with notable personalities from the industry's formative years is informative and entertaining.
B0046W1692|5.0|I am surprised at the number of luke-warm reviews this album received on Amazon.  I cannot stop playing this album.  I think it is one of Mana's best. While it's certainly true that they didn't venture into new territory here-  why is this necessary?  Mana has a very distinctive sound.  If you love their sound you will love this album.  To me it's as simple as that.  My only complaint about the group in general is that they wait so long between studio releases.

B002RGKCDK|3.0|We're called Extreme. Our hair is extreme (Gary looks like Elaine Benes in the photo shoots), our music is extreme and our lyrics are extreme! But like, since a lot of people who buy our records are athiests, we might just bury the more 'spiritual' side of out EXTREME lyrics under strings and trumpets.     Oh! Did I forget to mention these guys 'Extremely rock!', when these guys put the pedal to the metal they pump out energetic riffs like high-octane rockets. And that Elaine Benes look-alike, he knows how to scream like he was in a band called 'EXTREME!!'.     Their dedication to generic funk metal riffs are obscured by a lot of window dressing, but sometimes generic funk-metal riffs are powerful, like they might be on about half the songs here that are classed as rockers (Peacemaker Die, Warheads, ESP Rest in Peace). And other songs, such as 'Our Father', are dressed in proggy or alt-rock clothes, but soon race back to generic hair-funk riffs, like an iron filing married to a large, jealous and possessive magnet, in effect ruining the fake sense of variety. Only 'Tragic Comic' and 'Stop the world' break through the barricades.     Well, that's until the last three or four songs signify some glorious, 20+ minute stab at significance. At least this doesn't take it's cue from Genesis or Yes cut and paste, so I'd say EXTREME are on a higher ground than Marillion's flock of not-quite millions of minions.     And this is where EXTREME'S dream became an 'ex-dream', well, at least commercially. But artistically, to use some vernacular, \\"ain't half bad\\". And you know the formula, as artistic merit increases, yep, commercial sales DECREASE. Rating ***1/4 (3.25)
B004OKFIYU|4.0|This SACD release of Billy Joel's Piano Man is unusual in that it sounds EXACTLY like its 1970's vintage vinyl counterpart. If you were blindfolded, I don't think you'd be able to tell the two apart. So this is good, right? Well, in this case, not really, because this particular album has a somewhat soft, chocolatey, non-dynamic sound that could probably have benefitted from a remaster using the original session tapes. But that's not the concept, I suppose, of this \\"original master recording\\" series, so I guess I can't complain. Overall, the sound is very smooth and natural, particularly vocals, and much more reminiscent of vinyl than standard CD. If you're lucky enough to have the original album (in good condition) and a high quality turntable, there's no need to purchase this SACD. If not, buy this version and enjoy some vintage Billy J., complete with vintage sound!

B000055X3U|5.0|Following the austere minimalism of the dejected Alternative 4, Anathema return to the elaborate instrumental style and vast compositional scope of Eternity on their fifth album, Judgement, an album characterized by diverse expansions of traditional rock-song formats, arranged with the compositional insight for melodic development and atmospheric layering, expressed with a more hopeful spirit than previous works, but with the band's trademark fluidity in merging of rhythm and tone toward thematic representation, orchestrated for maximum emotional impact. After an album scarce in instrumental expressiveness, listeners are graced with the sound of Danny Cavanagh's dynamically communicative guitar-playing, his performance here ranking as his most spirited and potently expressive, Judgement abundant with moments of pure sonic bliss in the form of Cavanagh's lead playing, highlights of which are the blistering solo in the charged \\"Pitiless\\", his tender atmospheric touches in the serene \\"2000 & Gone\\", the soulful quality of his subtle melodies during the intro and outro of \\"Emotional Winter\\", the heart-wrenching overflow of sorrowful emotion that is the solo of the grieving \\"One Last Goodbye\\", and the soaring tranquility of his playing during the fantastic coda of \\"Wings Of God\\"; the guitar-work of the Cavanagh brothers on this release is phenomenal, capturing a wide range of feelings in both electric and acoustic guitars, using the latter to great affect in delicately expressing the fragility of desperate loneliness; their skill in creating unfolding melodies continuously blossoming through transitions determining harmonic substance provides the music with a wonderful communicative essence, reflecting lyrical themes in the conceptual design of musical passages.    \\"Solitude was never seen as loneliness   And things need time   And time leads to other things   And playing roles   Which are limited   By the poor fund of knowledge   In this sick, sick world   We all fall down   Once in a while   Escaping the law of the unexplained pains\\"    The scope of songwriting is more expansive than the individually composed songs of Alternative 4, as most of the writing on Judgement is shared between the musicians, including new bassist Dave Pybus who replaces longtime bassist and songwriter Duncan Patterson, the songs here are more fleshed out and versatile, while continuing the band's characteristic contrasting movements of climactic intention, similar in method to progressive rock but not in aesthetic purpose; the expressive character of the music is highly concentrated on creating eloquent melodies of flowing atmospheric quality as opposed to ever-shifting patterns of energetically animated music in complex structures; witness the ethereal elegance of \\"Make It Right\\", the spatial immensity of \\"Emotional Winter\\", and the dramatic shifts in enveloping waves of thematic articulation in \\"Wings Of God\\" for prime examples of this band's brilliance in actualizing their versatile expressive purpose. Vincent Cavanagh has developed into an outstanding vocalist, delivering his most consistently captivating performance since taking over the role of lead singer, granting the music an impassioned force with a keen sense of melody working in perfect harmony with the guitars, complimented occasionally by heavenly female vocals, his soaring cries and the graceful quality of his melodic articulations at times accentuated by the dreamy ambience of keyboards or punctuated by a piano; since many of these songs were arranged to emphasize Vincent's increasingly compelling and emotively powerful singing, the album's atmospheric quality is dependent to a considerable extent on his performance, as is the flow of the entire album, which is sequenced much like the continuously evolving  Eternity; Anathema want to give their audience an experience in the form of an album developing its unifying themes in an active exploration from beginning to end, and Judgement  delivers this in remarkable fashion.    \\"All the hate that feeds your needs   All the sickness you conceive   All the horror you create   Will bring you to your knees\\"    Kit Woolven's production provides instrumental clarity and promotes the ambient elements of the band's sound, yet the pleasant return of original drummer John Douglas is marred somewhat by the production's lack of fullness in the low-end sound, meaning that the natural fluidity and power of Douglas's playing loses presence of sound and impact. But the texture of the instrumentation is vividly pronounced in the sound, working to the music's intention of sweeping the listener into lavish atmospheres, arousing the dream of freedom...freedom from the illusions and limitations of a transient existence, suspended in the fantasy of a beautiful escape, until you come back down to the reality of an earthly existence, but this time Anathema won't let you drown in the ocean of your despair, as they now sing songs urging you to break down your emotional force-fields and engage honestly with your emotions, come to understanding through trust, and feel life in all its temporal glory by embracing the moment of being alive, and come to terms with your mistakes of a past kept alive only in memory, no longer a slave in the chains of the past, now free to seize the preciousness of the present moment and bask in the beautiful tragedy of this life. This is the hopeful message of Judgement, a hopeful message that acknowledges pain and suffering as a condition of existence to be honestly confronted and embraced toward a deeper and more fulfilling connection with ourselves and the world around us; this realization and acceptance is inherent in the spiritual fabric of the music, brought to life through a near perfection in compositional application of artistic vision and the full-on immersion of the band members into the creation of their ideas in musical form, making Judgement the band's most expressively powerful work.

B000PMLFRA|2.0|Yes, the Star Wars movies have a lot of magic, especially the 70's and 80's versions.  But the marketing ploys that have come along with it have really killed the mood. It started with VHS, one movie per tape.  Then came the fancy boxed set.  Then shortly after came the theatrical CGI update.  Then came the VHS CGI-update boxed set.  Then came the various incarnations on DVD, sold separately as full screen or wide screen, then came the boxed set. Then came the prequels (ok... this part didn't market me to death).  Now it's time to double dip with blu ray.  First we have the boxed set... cool. Why was the original non-CGI release not included?  One blu-ray disc can hold both versions.  Look for it later on yet another incarnation of the franchise. I give the original trilogy 4 stars, and the prequels 2 stars.  The marketing over the years has jaded me, so I can only give 2 stars for all things considered.
031261246X|4.0|When I first saw the movie, THE NET, I thought that was the worst that could ever happen with computer technology but ZERO DAY proves creative people can always find ways to use their talents to cause harm.  The anniversary of 9/11 is approaching and chilling events are taking place.  An airliner's onboard computer fails to respond, same at a nuclear plant, an oil tanker, and even a hospital where a computer gives out the wrong dose of medicine killing several people.  Jeff Aiken lost a fianc&eacute;e in the Twin Towers and had resigned from the CIA because his boss wouldn't believe all the warning signs Jeff had pointed out.  He now owns his own computer tech company and is called in to help fix a computer problem at a legal firm.  When he starts to see a pattern in some of the messages from other incidents, he gets suspicious. A tech at the law firm assisting him sends a message through a hacker chat room hoping to draw out the culprit. When she turns up dead, Jeff figures he's next.  This is a chilling example that makes stealing identities seem like child's play.  The only confusing part is the ending.  This reader was led to believe Jeff was able to stop the attack, but this is followed by events still taking place.  Although a good thriller read, I am not tech savvy so much of the tech language and descriptions were lost on me.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|~<br />This was a solid 4-star book, in my opinion, not great - but good.<br /><br />If nothing else, ROOM, will get one thinking about how we all create `reality' and how we all make truths out of our shared concepts of time and space. This novel will have you questioning ideas that you were so sure of previously:  What is pleasurable? What is tolerable? What is torturous? What is real and what is imagined?<br /><br />I have to agree with the previous reviewer in regards to the obvious (and quite annoying) inconsistent levels of intellect of the 5 year old narrator.  I also thought that these inconsistencies went way beyond what would reasonably be expected of a child who lived in said conditions.<br /><br />Overall, this was an enjoyable read, worth the money, and recommended.

Has great advice on skin care, nutrition and diet for good skin, basic makeup skills and techniques, how to choose and use tools and much much more. What's more, this book is beautiful to look at. The images are stunning and also very helpful.    Highly recommend!! Wont disappoint.
0312600844|1.0|The problem with Freedom is that it is a \\"thesis\\" book, the kind of book that critics and intellectualoids love. A book that tries to prove a point, that old industrial civilization and traditional values are dead and that a new service driven, post modernist society is here.  While this may true, Franzen forgets that this is no excuse for not having a story or at least plausible characters, since this a novel, not a non-fiction book. People in reality can't be reduced to formulas, in order to prove a sociological point. They are often contradictory, emotional, and not always totally true to their convictions.   People in \\"Freedom\\" sound like robots, they are just wax figures developed to help the author prove his thesis. They are absolutely rigid and artificial, which makes this book one of the most boring I have ever read.
B004HYDL1K|5.0|This is seriously hilarious entertainment. It's not even remotely realistic in any sense. Ridiculously short skirts and freakishly large guns... All of the women are smokin' hot. You will not find the laws of probability or physics anywhere in this film. If you're the serious type watch something else, if you can let your hair down for an hour and half, then enjoy... It's a fun ride. Kudos to Rodriquez. He re-invents \\"over-the-top.\\"
076790592X|4.0|I put off reading this book for various reasons, one of which involves me not liking to read about real death. (Stories about fictional characters dying? No problem.) I eventually had to read this for class & now I can see what all of the fuss is about.<br /><br />Albom has a very easy writing style that's easy to get into & highly approachable, which is wonderful considering that the subject matter can easily push people away. There's just enough information about Morrie & Albom's pasts (together & separate) to draw us into the book & make this more than just \\"a tale about other people\\". I found myself really getting attached to Morrie & as a result, the end of the book did make me teary eyed. My only complaint is that at times Albom just seemed a little self congratulatory.<br /><br />This really is a wonderful book & something I'd recommend reading at any time, not just because a professor says that you should. I'm a bit sorry that it's taken me this long to read it. It's an incredibly fast read but one that'll stay with you for a while afterwards.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Having seen the films, here's my very brief updated review.<br /><br />It's not as bad as some feared it would be (given that they're older transfers -- a route I still maintain was a cheap way to go). But it could still stand to be improved in a lot of ways with a new trasfer.<br /><br />As to the films themselves:<br /><br />1. There have been changes. Some work; some have caused even more fan contention. I'm one of those that actually wishes for more changes. I think TPM, AOTC, ROTS could stand to have major editing and fx work done to them. So put me in the camp of wanting even MORE special edition changes to both the special effects and narrative.<br /><br />2. There's no original versions. Even though I prefer the SEs, I think fans should be able to get the version they grew up with.<br /><br />3. Special features: Everything from the past DVD set should've been ported over. It hasn't, so hold on to your DVD copies if you want those documentaries. There are still features from the old videos that haven't been released on digital.<br /><br />Hopefully, one day the equivalent of the Blade Runner or Aliens blu-ray sets, which contained all the different versions of the films (including new versions), will come out. This isn't the Ultimate Edition box set that fans had been teased with for years, and will not include extended versions of all six films. Additionally, the \\"100 hours of new documentary footage\\" fans had been teased with by Rick MaCallum in 2007 isn't here, which implies an eventual later set, likely in another 7/8 years.<br /><br />In the meantime, the films look great, and this is the best version available for home viewing. Some good news: the grotesque puppet Yoda in TPM was (thankfully) replaced with a digital version that looks like Yoda. It helps TPM quite a bit (though, as I said, more is needed for that film).<br /><br />For those who want to look deeper, take a moment to read about Star Wars' sordid history on video -- including the reasons four of the six films were downgraded in image quality -- on the site, The Secret History of Star Wars (in the article: \\"Saving Star Wars.\\")four of the six films were downgraded in image quality -- on the site, The Secret History of Star Wars (in the article: \\"Saving Star Wars.\\")

B004IQMXD4|5.0|\\"In Your Dreams\\", Stevie Nicks' seventh solo album and her first in ten years, has really shown how the artist has come full circle. As a whole, it is one of her strongest to date, many already comparing it to \\"Bella Donna.\\" A lengthy record of 13 tracks (14 if you count the extra track available on some editions), Miss Nicks has certainly proven herself to be prolific. Obviously the strongest element here is simply the artist's voice--which sounds stronger and more capable than ever. Miss Nicks has certainly matured in both her singing and in her songwriting. The very first listen brought tears to the eyes.    There are many gems on this album, and of course there are the obvious standouts. \\"In Your Dreams\\", \\"Annabel Lee\\", \\"You May Be The One\\", and \\"Italian Summer\\" are going to be the memorable tracks. The title track starts out sounding somewhat like a Hidden Valley commercial, but is quite catchy and in no way offensive. The touch of rockabilly makes it very suitable for radio play. \\"You May Be The One\\" is an old-style, bluesy number, the kind of song for which the artist's voice was made. Even \\"Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream)\\", a.k.a. \\"The Vampire Song\\", is quite beautiful--and this reviewer admittedly has never read or seen a single episode of Twilight.    Notably present here is a clear element of country, an element which has resurfaced in a number of her tracks throughout her long career: \\"I Don't Want To Know\\" ('Rumours'), \\"After the Glitter Fades\\" ('Bella Donna'), \\"That's Alright\\" ('Mirage'), \\"No Questions Asked\\" ('Fleetwood Mac Greatest Hits'), \\"Affairs of the Heart\\" ('Behind The Mask'), \\"Rose Garden\\" ('Street Angel')--none of which is surprising for a girl from Arizona. \\"For What It's Worth\\" could easily be played on any country station; the chorus of \\"New Orleans\\" could have been penned by Kenny Chesney. Even \\"Cheaper Than Free\\" reveals a hint of country, particularly in the guitar solo. Here Stevie confirms what she has always claimed, that one of her biggest influences aside from Joplin and Hendrix, is and always has been her late grandfather, AJ Nicks--with whom she first started singing as a very young girl.    The obvious gem of this record--and granted this is a strictly subjective statement--is \\"Everybody Loves You\\", co-written with Dave Stewart. It is the strongest track on the record, performed with Mr. Stewart, whose deep baritone compliments Stevie's most appropriately. The lyrics are sweet and poignant, and seem to be a reflection of the artist's life, as are many of her songs: \\"Everybody loves you, but you're so alone. Everybody knows your name, but you can't find your way home. No one really knows you; I'm the only one.\\" For me this track is simply one of her best. Ever.    On the flip side, \\"Soldier's Angel\\" is clearly the weak link of the line-up. While noble in intent, and beautifully sung, it is awkward in its presentation even with Lindsey Buckingham's backing harmonizing vocals. Reminiscent of 1991's \\"Desert Angel\\", but not nearly as strong a track, and like \\"Illume (9-11)\\" from Fleetwood Mac's 'Say You Will' album of 2003, it is clearly meant to acknowledge and provide a personal commentary on current events. At least two other tracks from the record provide similar commentaries, but do so in a much more subtle way.    Ms. Nicks tends to repeat herself in a number of ways, many of which we are used to seeing in her former work. She lifts lines from previous songs, just as she always has (\\"come in out of the darkness\\", \\"no words were spoken\\", \\"lady from the mountains\\", \\"no one walks away from this battle\\", \\"sometimes it was heavenly, sometimes it was too heavy\\", and that ever persistent \\"ghost through the fog\\"). Sometimes this self-referencing works; at other times, it can be somewhat off putting, even to her most loyal listeners.    Miss Nicks also has the tendency to repeat certain concepts or words in her songs: \\"angel\\", the aforementioned \\"ghost\\", and \\"child\\" come to mind here. Clearly she likes to use certain types of words like \\"angel\\" and \\"child\\", as she enunciates them well and they work particularly well with her voice. Angels, ghosts, and dreams have always been a common thread in most of Miss Nicks' work, with \\"dreams\\" having figured prominently in her writing since the days of 'Rumours'.    And finally, a noticeable `blooper' that occurs in one of her songs here: you can clearly hear Dave Stewart providing a musical cue, \\"Here we go\\", faintly, just after the intro to the track \\"New Orleans\\", which, I have to admit, I found more amusing than anything else. Even the best are human and can miss a thing or two in their time!    In any case, at sixty something, Miss Nicks has certainly earned her keep--and can pretty much write whatever the heck she wants.    We will still listen. And be moved appropriately.

1416594787|4.0|This isn't the best introductory book I've read on evolution, Dawkins loves to insult the people who don't hold his views, goes way to far sometimes to get his point across and has a tendency to ramble on and mention interesting but irrelevant stuff.  Once you get past the flaws this actually is a pretty good book, oddly by the end some of those qualities I hated about the book in the beginning, I started to appreciate more in the end (I kind of enjoy the almost pointless side stories and facts).      When I started reading this book, I put it down for a while because I got tired of the creationist rants, which apparently the high number of people who deny evolution is why this book is written.  Dawkins even goes as far as comparing an evolution denier as the equivalent of someone denying the existence of the roman civilization or even worse a holocaust denier.  I'm sorry but lacking the understanding or denying evolution is nothing like denying the holocaust.  For one thing we've never really witnessed one animal evolving into another completely different species, meaning one \\"kind\\" into another \\"kind\\", in our lifetime (which is far too short of a time scale) or even more a bacteria evolving into a mammal, this doesn't mean evolution is false (its not), but it is far different than denying the holocaust.  Anyways eventually I picked the book back up and it was far better as I got further into it.  Also expect to hear the word \\"history-deniers\\" every few pages, I guess he wants us to remember just how terrible the evolution deniers are.  Since this book is written to convince the 40% of American who deny evolution, Dawkins should realize by now that insulting your target audience isn't the best way to get them to listen to you.  If anything his books do more help to the young earth creationist movement and intelligent design.     The subtitle of this book is \\"The Evidence for Evolution\\", which is kind of an unfitting title, I found that Coyne's Why Evolution is Truecontains far more evidence in far fewer pages and is overall a better introduction to evolution.   You see Dawkins often goes off on rants which do not to move the evidence along. For example in a chapter he discusses the age of the earth, he spends several pages discussing getting the age from tree rings.  You see you can match the width of tree rings with others and go back to earlier dates, but then he says that the chain of tree rings goes back 11,000 years only, well the pages he spent on this argument do nothing to convince a young earth creationist of the age of the earth, in fact the argument works in their favor.  The book is full of these little side notes and stories which causes the page numbers to go up, but the relevant information doesn't follow.   Also expect tons of foot notes with mostly rants about TV shows he wants to be on, his childhood, or why we should call the Beijing Man, the Peking fossil, ect.    I know I've complained some but don't get me wrong, this book, once you look past the flaws, is still very interesting and worth reading (assuming that you're not a creationist).  Many of the side stories which I complained about are actually interesting if you don't mind frequent diversions and he goes into DNA a little more than the other non DNA specific evolution books I've read.  So in the end I do think its pretty good, just not as a first book on evolution.
B004NSULHM|3.0|And I mean this in the nicest way possible. Beware that you'll think this is another \\"In Rainbows\\" album, which is my favorite from Radiohead. I have to agree with a few of the other reviewers and say that there only two songs on the whole album that I can truly say are amazing - \\"Give up the Ghost\\" and \\"Separator\\". First time I heard \\"ghost\\" I was awestruck at how unbelievably beautiful the song was. And is. But unfortunately, the songs that came before it were so forgetable that I was really needing something to strike a chord in me. That was it. I hear that song in my head all day. Then, to end the album with \\"Separator\\", I was filled with the sense that Radiohead hadn't made me question them. But after listening to the album over and over again, I draw the same conclusions. I'm all about them being different and expanding their horizons, but outside of those songs, it's just not there...
0670022411|4.0|I completed reading DOW last night and have arrived at three insights about the book. First, the Good, is that I could NOT initially put it down. Up until about page 200, I was totally \\"bewitched\\" by the characters, the story, and the setting. The writing was wonderful and the characters, while not yet fully exposed, had become important friends of mine. I gushed about the book to my wife who is also an avid reader and probably told her too much about the story to that point. The blending of story, character, and history was fast paced and emotionally engaging.  Secondly, the first toad was the middle section of the book that seemed to my eyes to drag on into the style of a romance novel. Believe me I am not a fan of romance novels. For some, this will not be seen as a toad, but rather as a gem of a romantic tale. The key word here is drag because the tale slows to a crawl for us guys who prefer a fast paced thriller over a romance novel.   Finally, the last toad may only be a tadpole. It is the end of the book is a teaser for what I expect to be at least a trilogy. The end left the main characters and the reader actually hanging out in the witchwind.   Even with the true toad and a tadpole, I can highly recommend the book because the total journey into the past where science and the superstition collide is worth the time and effort.

0756404738|4.0|Not much to say that hasn't already been said, but I wanted to add my \\"star\\" to the rating.  I very much enjoyed this book, and I loved the idea of Kvothe taking a leave from the University for a bit.  After all, where else are all these stories about him supposed to come from?  But, in each new area, the story gets very drawn out.  I agree that there seems to have been a lack of editing.  However, if the third installment suffers from the same problem, I will eagerly buy it regardless because I love the story and the characters.
0553582038|1.0|Been said by others I know, but still... the devotion of an entire book to lame and boring characters just totally derails this series.  This one is so uninteresting that I've still not managed to get through it.  The total lack of the second best character in the series (Jon) and the near lack of the best (Arya) makes this a pure disappointment... top that off with the fact that the majority of the thing is focused on cerci (and the wench who should have stayed a supporting character) makes it bloody unbearable!  Waste of time and money.
076115678X|5.0|This book, combined with the advice of a trained Devachan-trained curly hair specialist, inspired me to finally love my curls after 40+ years of misery!

Seriously, if you are a curly girl and you don't absolutely love your hair then you need to get this book to help you know how to care for your hair, love your hair, and boost your esteem.

If you are not ready to grow and be told about yourself by someone who you don't know , or who you never met...don't read this!!! This book basically told me that I have a very BIG ego, and so do many other people...regardless if we admit it or not. Eckhart Tolle broke it down on who (I) or (You) are in today's world. The book spoke about growing and obtaining consciousness (your sense of being). The book also spoke about dysfunction, and how we keep ourselves unhappy, without us even knowing what we are doing. It opened up my eyes to a lot of things and put me in deep thought, which to Tolle is considered being unconscious! A bit strange, but this book is a definite must read if you want to experience some form of full consciousness, because although you may think your conscious right now...are you really???    I leave with one of my favorite quotes from the book... \\"You will be free to let go of your unhappiness the moment you recognize it as unintelligent. Negativity is not intelligent. It is always of the ego. The ego may be clever, but it is not intelligent.\\"      Enjoy!

The best it could be done the best it will sounds for me.However for this record the Band decide to make simple production and less use of arrangments on every song, anyway if the purpose of that was to make something quieter: THEY FAIL. This album is a brutal kick of energy and irreverent well thought irreverently metal. Agressive riffs, drums and screams incluided for the price of one simple CD.

1932100660|1.0|I have three problems with this book.<br /><br />1. It is not give a detailed prescription. Other than \\"avoid animal products\\", there is little else. The book is full of various statistics supposedly proving how bad animal products are, and abuse of the various industries involved in food production, but little useful guidance on how to eat healthily.<br /><br />2. There is no guidance on how to manage the severe challenges of living healthily on a vegan diet, which he advocates. I have known a number of people who went on vegan diets and all developed sub-optimal health at best and outright health problems at worst. I can count myself among this group. Yes I ate beans and balanced my proteins etc etc. I took up animal products again in moderate quantities and my health recovered.<br /><br />3. His use of statistics proving his case is selective and likely to mislead. You can find detailed critiques using web search tools like google.<br /><br />Poking around I eventually realized that Campbell is a vegan zealot and everything he says should be taken in this context.

B00275EHJG|5.0|After pouring over many very well written praises about Toy Story 3 I won't add too much to what's already been said. However, for me this trilogy and magnificence of Pixar creations, which I believe was spawned (as a company) by John Lasseter, has to be the greatest of them all. Well, everything Pixar creates is great and over the top. We all have our favorites and I believe citing one is not to slight the other. It's simply what's inside each of us that harmonizes with the storyline and that's what makes some films to some people more noteworthy than others. Still, I find this trilogy absolutely incredible in every way, shape and form. You have to also understand I was never one to like or enjoy watching animation, anything, then or now. I'm about 65 years of age and I believe it was some 15 years ago when a friend of mine insisted I go to the movies and see Toy Story, the first installment. At first, I was reluctant to go, but he and his wife talked me into it. It was the best talking into I ever had. Strangely, she didn't like the movie and walked out earlier. Her husband and I sat and watched the movie and I just couldn't believe my eyes or ears what showed and sounded on that big silver screen. In time, I saw Toy Story 2, and just last evening I finally got to watch the final installment of this peerless trilogy of movies. It also finally kicked in that here was a narrative much like the previous two focusing on, not only childhood and fraternity, especially the loyalty among the toy members to their master playmate, Andy, but also epic moral lessons pivoting around humanity's light. These stories all show and share this main trait, this overcoming whatever needs to be triumphed over, and for the sake of loyalty, love and friendship, and an abiding sense of humanity's spirit. These films just make you feel proud to be among our genus; happy to find a way out of the usual darkness of our lives, the politics and warfare, the brute and brunt force of society in general. And for a little while there is a saga worth plugging into, sometimes the iffiness of life that Woody and the crew must unite together and somehow get through. Toy Story, this last and final installment, certainly stacks the odds against all of them, yet we are so grateful that every loose end ties up, and all the characters get to live on, even that slick strawberry-smelling bear, but not quite to his liking. I mean, how he ended up. Of course, no one gets to be and play a cowboy forever, or so goes the famous line in \\"Monte Walsh.\\" And Andy has grown up and has to put his toys away, though not his inner child. This movie is so touching in so many ways, so healing, that I just felt myself turning back inside and meeting head on that inner child of mine, the feelings somewhat mixed, though a blessing. Thank you, Pixar, and all your wonderful and peerless creative people who make these films. You are sine qua non. The humanity of these stores is the right prescription for the illness of today's world. These stories are a beacon of light and life for those who desperately need it, and I am one such. I'll continue being a fan and follower and purchaser of your products. Meanwhile, the Toy Story saga will live within me, as will the likes of Wall-E, Up, Cars, Nemo, and all the rest.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on my android galaxy. I do experience a tiny bit of lag at times. Does seem a little easier than other versions. Love the new characters!
B000089RVX|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. It is one of my favorites from Evanescence. I did not know much about this band until I started listening to their songs on youtube. Amy Lee's voice is just amazing!!! Great purchase. Very pleased!!!
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I love Lisa Gardner's books, but why does she usually let us know who the bad guys are by putting them in so many scenes in which they do their bad guy stuff? We shouldn't have followed Mr. Bosu throughout the novel. He could have popped up at the end. That would have explained a lot, added more suspense, and the reader would have had more fun trying to figure things out. As always, well-written, with crackling dialogue.

B004LL1HM4|5.0|This recording is meant to be digested in one sitting.  Repeatedly.  I feel that after you hear the whole thing from front to back you will be able to understand the individual tracks, what they do, what they say, how they function, like they are part of a puzzle.  Once the puzzle is complete you can see how the parts fit together.  Many of the tunes feature multiple movements so be patient, there are rewards in the end.  And when you hit PLAY again, like watching a movie for the second time, you'll recognize things you've heard and discover new things you didn't hear.  And you will not regret investing your time into this music.  Nothing is superfluous, all sounds are in place on purpose, but it sounds so natural.  And as far as pleasing the fans of their first recording, it's a slam dunk.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|While 1.11 served as a good \\"HD\\" remake of the first six episodes, 2.22 makes Rebuild it's own continuity and arguably does it better than the original. Shinji's less whiny, Rei and Asuka both get more character development, Mari serves to be a great new character (also slightly insane), and the story itself is just better in every way. If you're a fan of the original series, you owe it to yourself to watch this.     Also, does anyone else see this as possibly being a sequel instead of a remake? Weird, I know, but it's Eva so anything's possible.

Just listen to all the fans and give them what they are clamoring for! I will not be buying this. If you are going to sell me something I've already purchased half a dozen different times over the years at least sell me the version I want to own.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We played this game with some friends and then had to buy it.  Even our 6 and 8 year old are able to play.  You can only play 4 players unless you buy the extensions and there are quite a few small pieces so you need to be careful if you have children playing that they don't get lost.
B001B67VR2|5.0|GGGB is my most favorite Rihanna era. It was released during the year when my life was at my worst and best, but released near the month where it was the greatest and at its highest peak. This is the best album she has ever put out period in terms of production, hooks, and arrangement. Songs like Umbrella, Don't Stop the Music, and Question Existing flow really well. Rihanna has really improved from her first two albums. You could tell that she and the producers had worked really well to put her on the top. It pushed her to the highest peak in her career while my life also felt it was at its highest peak when technically it really wasn't. GGGB is one of those albums that make me love her even more. This album has more variety of 80s influenced dance pop and some r'n'b music, but she hasn't completely ditched her reggae sound at all. It's still felt in songs such as Say It which is my most played song on my ipod! It's the best pop album of the decade! Fans and all lovers of pop music should include this on their playlist. I feel that GGGB showed more artistic growth and allowed her to break out that Beyonce image into her own. I like to think of this record as her own \\"True Blue\\".<br /><br />1) Umbrella (5/5)- her strongest single ever. Back then, I never knew this song will put her on the top. It's like this song became an overnight success. She was starting to appear all over the place. It may be overplayed but it's still her catchiest single yet.<br /><br />2) Push Up On Me (5/5)- this song is such a tease in which she didn't showed that side prior to this album.<br /><br />3) Don't Stop The Music (5/5)- this song was overplayed on the radio. The lyrics and hook flowed so well together with MJ's sample which give the song more strength. Who ever wrote this song did a great job and knew what they were doing.<br /><br />4) Breakin' Dishes(5/5)- I love the chorus. The song itself reminds me of Beyonce's Ring The Alarm. The aggressiveness and the similar theme, but I think this song is a lil bit more catchier. I love the part where is saying...\\"breakin...dishes..breakin...dishes\\". I can just imagine listeners singing along to that part.<br /><br />5) Shut Up And Drive (5/5)- Awesome song! Awesome guitar riff! This is the edgiest song Rihanna has come out with! Definitely one of my top 5! I love it how she sings \\"can you handle the purr?\\" This is like Janet's Black Cat.<br /><br />6) Hate That I Love You (5/5)- I'm not a big fan of Ne-Yo. He's no Babyface, but this song is the best he has ever come up with. I feel that the lyrics are relatable. It sounded really nice with the acoustic guitar.<br /><br />7) Say It (5/5)- My MOST played song!!! I love this song to DEATH! I don't know if this song had used a sample, but it takes me back to those old school reggae songs. I don't understand the hatred of this song. It's so underrated and one of her best in my opinion. It's worth all of my time! I can relate to the lyrics on how a boy should explains what he really feels inside instead of hiding it. Say what's really bugging him. It actually brings tears to my eyes because it brings back memories of '07 and how I came in contact with people I haven't seen or heard from in a long time! It's so darn cute!<br /><br />8) Sell Me Candy (5/5)- a song that talks about all her fantasies of a boy and uses a melting ice cream as a metaphor. pretty hot stuff!<br /><br />9) Lemme Get That (5/5)- this is kinda like a sequel to Sell Me Candy, but this time it is more in a materialistic sense rather than frozen dessert.<br /><br />10) Rehab (5/5)-I favored this JT/Rihanna collaboration over Cold Case Love. Her make-up looked amazing in the video.<br /><br />11) Question Existing (5/5)- definitely underrated and such a rare gem. I never knew Rihanna had it in her to do a song like this. The spoken part is epic. It's like a leftover from Madonna's Erotica. There aren't that many songs nowadays that sounded this amazing and unique.<br /><br />12) Good Girl Gone Bad (4/5)- It's like Hate That I Love You pt. 2. It's about not getting the respect she deserves from a guy so once a girl turns bad they never go back. Think Tina Turner's Better Be Good To Me.<br /><br />13) Disturbia (4.5/5)-It's a dark and catchy. What can I say?<br /><br />14. Take A Bow (2/5)- I'm not too fond over this song. I consider it the weakest song on here and as a single.<br /><br />15. If I Never See Your Face Again (5/5)-I actually like this song than the other Maroon 5 songs I heard in the past.irl Gone Bad (4/5)- It's like Hate That I Love You pt. 2.

0345529057|5.0|If you came here because you either saw the show or plan on watching, buy these instead. George R.R. Martin does a wonderful job of introducing you to a plethora of interesting characters. Each chapter is written from a different characters point-of-view. The characters and the land within the series is both detailed and damaged. Every character seems to have one issue or another going on; leading to some very personable story telling. I highly recommend the first book; as well as the first half of the second, beyond that I have yet to read. All I can really say is, best $20 I ever spent.    That was all about the books, here's what I have to say about Amazon. I started using Amazon to buy DVDs a few years ago, I then moved up to the video-on-demand feature. Now I buy anything I can from here, college texts, books, video cards, etc. Everything got to me in pristine condition and on record time.
1401207529|5.0|Frank Miller's take on the origins of Batman is a refreshing and well paced story from start to end.    I'm not great at reviewing in the traditional paragraph form so I've decided to do pros and cons and to keep this review as short and concise as possible.    PRO:  - The story is as simple as they come all the while still leaving a fulfilling feeling at the end of it. There was never a dull moment and I really enjoyed myself throughout the whole thing.  - The art is amazing. David Mazzucchelli brings a unique and bold art style to the world of Gotham. He uses bold strong lines with shades and contour that should be admired. I don't want to spoil it but it's great and quite possibly the best part of this piece.  - The story is half Batman and half Jim Gordon. This works out extremely well because somehow they manage to make Gordon's arrival at the Gotham PD and Wayne's transformation into Batman equally interesting. Just as you're beginning to tire of one of them, the other takes over the panels and by the end when they are sharing panels it seems like a great pay off.   - One thing I despise in comics is when the writer turns to dialogue and makes the whole thing too wordy. Frank Miller excels in showing not telling and I really wish that more comic writers would work close with their illustrator to achieve this. Never did I look at a page and feel daunted by the amount of dialogue or wordiness on the page. Comics are meant to tell a story but they are not meant to be books with a picture fighting a text bubble for attention.  - An after word by artist David Mazzucchelli is a very nice way to wrap up the book and provides a nice insight into what he was trying to achieve in illustrating year one.    CON:  - It is short. I wish there was more to read but that's just because it is so well done. It is 96 pages of pure genius and I wish it were that plus a couple zero's at the end of that number.  - There is a catwoman origin stuck in their that seemed rushed and notso great. I think given time and space it could have grown and become something substancial but it seemed cut off and no closure was brought to the character.  - The beginning is abrupt and doesn't give as much background that I would have liked but that's a small complaint in an otherwise perfect story structure.      Overall the comic is a great addition to anyone's collection and Miller should be commended for his simplistic yet deep style of telling a story. All in all, perfect Batman origins comic and a great comic for a person to get started in the character.
B000FQJAIM|1.0|Well I am sure that there are so many who will agree with me on this. For one thing George Lucas was Stupid Enough to RUIN the Series with the crappy \\"Pre-Quals\\" and to also try to out do Himself again by changing the once barely accepted Special Editions (1997) with Sadistic 2004 Alternate Editions. And too Release them TWICE One Right AFTER the Other (2004-2005) on Two Different Cases. Now to Finally ACCEPT that People Do Not Like the Specials; he released the Original Theatrical Versions. But in the WORST LOWEST Format. Laserdisc are very CUMBERSOME but are HEAVEN compared to the DVD quality. And to only Re-Release for the THIRD time the 2004 only this time changed the artwork on the Disc(s). And the Most Advertised and Anticipated Original Release for the First time was a Complete JOKE!, It was the SECOND DISC AN ADDED FEATURE. ONLY for People to Suffer once Again and pay for the Crappy Alternate Editions.   Now I'm Definatly and Anti-Special Edition. Yet I do not Despise the \\"Prequals\\" only that George stared with 4 when released Phantom Menace is Episode 4 and so on. 1-3 are Star Wars (Not New Hope) Empire Strikes Back and Return (Originally Revenge of the Jedi) of the Jedi.   So many will and do AGREE with me. So People Do Not give in Never Buy this DVD. Set up a DVD Burning Party and burn them. There are a WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.

0345522478|4.0|I would recommend the book to any friend who enjoys fantasy.      Atticus O'Sullivan is a 2100 year old druid in a 21 year old body living in Tempe AZ.  And he's pissed off a lot of people and gods in 2100 years.  The books is fast paced, with reasonable amount of background in the various  magics and world building that only rarely become intrusive.  I did occasionally skim the background magic info - but not often as Hearne is generally quick and to the point in his background.    O'Sullivan is slightly quirky and nicely drawn, but I found his familiar, an irish wolfhound named Oberon less so.  I wanted very much to like Oberon, but he is too intellectual and not enough a of dog in his thinking.  However, I enjoyed their relationship.      The plot moves quickly and I read the book in two sittings because it is a page turner.  I will certainly buy future books written in the world.
0307454541|1.0|I'm an avid reader and can usually get through any book in a week or less.  I couldn't even get through 130 pages in 2 weeks.  This book did nothing to peak my interest.  I gave up after 2 weeks.
159420229X|5.0|I just loved this book.  It's the story of how a reporter ended up training for the U.S Memory Championship in one year and then winning it.  That's not a spoiler because it is a blurb on the jacket.    It's a fascinating story and the subject matter is interesting in and of itself if you are interested either in memory or human performance.  You can learn some techniques by reading this book, but it is NOT a how-to guide.  The book does talk a lot about how it all works, it's just not a step-by-step guide so please don't expect that.  It is a story of a year in the life of the author and some of the people he met and worked with along the way.  In that respect it's really wonderful.  The chapter dealing Daniel Tammets was a complete surprise and almost worth the price of the book alone.  If you go into this book realizing it's a biographical narrative, with some interesting science and technique thrown in and not expecting something else, you will likely be please.  I definitely recommend it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is so much better than the original Angry Birds and I can finally get 3 stars on some levels!  When are the May 2011 levels being released!?  I can't wait!
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|The \\"image processing\\" completely screws up the actual image (or document or whatever) so it becomes completely incoherent. Not worth the price (and it's free)
0345529057|5.0|If you are looking for mass market paperback versions of these books, this set is a great deal at Amazon's price. For your money you get something like 3,700 pages of some of the best writing and characters modern fantasy has to offer.     I really like the new colors and cover art for the reissued editions (though I wish they all didn't carry the banner promoting the HBO series). I also prefer the smaller MMPB format for books this long.    I'm hoping that A Dance With Dragons will eventually be released in this format with matching cover art (I have noticed some publishers seem to be moving away from releasing MMPB editions at all, preferring larger, heavier -- and more expensive -- trade paperbacks).
B000FBJHZS|1.0|I have to admit I am not a big Dan Brown fan. But while the kinda fun plot and fast pace of The DaVinci Code made it bearable, this offering is not at all bearable. The writing, like DaVinci Code, felt like it was written by a college sophomore at best, and was aimed at an even younger audience and spoke down to them from a point of ignorance. I thought the presentation of scientific ideas throughout the book was laugable. It totally felt as though Brown had read a Scientific American paper on meteroids, and based the entire book on it without doing more than a cursory bit of research himself. The twists were painfully obvious miles ahead, and every single one of the characters, from the President, to Senator Sexton and his secretary, to the protagonist, were laughably thin througout. The diologe was absolutely pathetic.<br /><br />How this man continues to sell books, I'll never know.<br /><br />But it's the condrills! The CONDRILLS, and the urine on the leg... Oh dear God, just make it end.<br /><br />Thankfully it did (end).<br /><br />David

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Another vote for Lucas to stop taking a dump on fans of the originals.  I am willing to pay extra for unaltered restored BR copies of the theatrical releases of the original trilogy.  Why is this so much to ask for?  I truly believe Lucas must hate his fans; there is no other explanation.

In hell, the devil uses this book to punish condemned souls by forcing them to read it.<br /><br />This is the book that Oprah would recommend on her show. This is the book that causes underwear gnomes to fear for their lives and flee in haste. This is the book that makes a grown man cry.<br /><br />LOTS OF PEOPLE GAVE IT FIVE STARS -- BUT THE BOOK IS GARBAGE! A ROTTEN DECOMPOSING PHONE BOOK IS WORTH MORE THAN THIS ABOMINATION FROM THE UNDERWORLD!<br /><br />To be a little more specific:<br /><br />Think of the messiest and most retarded comic book you ever read, then multiply that times 10 (even normal comic books are organized). Think of a book FULL of excessive distractions and cheesy humor that only sabotages the learning process. Think of a book where each page is read like a maze. Think of a book with a technique used to explain concepts that is haphazard, casual, and takes the form of (previously hip) crufty neo-yuppie nonsense. Think of a book that wastes so much time and space on jokes and miserable illustrations such that the amount of useful knowledge gained is watered down like the kind of Kool-Aid served at summer camps for unruly illegitimate children!<br /><br />Quite frankly, I don't know what the hell was going through the authors' heads when they wrote this thing. Did they really think this was something they could be proud of? Were they trying to set an all-time worst record by going an order of magnitude below the Dummies(TM) line of books? And all the people who gave it 5 stars? Were they recruited from the Fisher-Price product feedback group?<br /><br />This book isn't meant for programmers. This book isn't meant for beginners. This book isn't meant for experts. This book isn't for smart or stupid people. THIS BOOK IS MEANT FOR: people who champion and appreciate disorganized, poorly distilled, distractedly entertaining quagmires of vomit served in blood-painted bowls made by the devil's idle hands, and set atop pillars of pure scourge.<br /><br />Do you suffer from attention deficit disorder? If so, then this book is for you, and it will help you minimize what you get out of your time and help you avoid dealing with your greatest fear: the fact that learning how to program is difficult and will always require concentration, exercise, and frustration. The truth hurts.<br /><br />DON'T FALL VICTIM TO THE HIGH RATING -- THIS BOOK STINKS! (LIKE A ROTTEN ROAD-KILLED SKUNK!!!)
0307477479|4.0|Well, I've been reading all the reviews, and it never ceases to amaze me how different people interpret the same book. Just for context,  I'm an over-educated older woman, a professional musician with one child. I have always lived in or near coastal cities. I'm an avid reader of books of all types. I  particularly love modern fiction writing from writers like Alice Munro, Anne Beattie, Ray Carver, Don Delillo, etc. Also enjoy Austen, James, Wharton et al, as well as science fiction writers like William Gibson and Olivia butler.<br /><br />I loved this book. I enjoy the style of linked stories, and really enjoyed the ways she explored the lives of characters that i didn't initially think were related. The language is beautiful, rich and evocative. I found the characters fascinating and very real, very clearly drawn with the least amount of verbiage possible. I had read the  story about two of the protagonists as kids  in the New Yorker, and thought it was pretty much perfect, maybe because I was in high school in SF in the late 70's. The final story is set in a near future, where everyone uses &quot;handsets&quot;, and buzz is created through the &quot;reach&quot; of paid shills called &quot;parrots&quot;. Interesting people of all generations and personality types are represented here, so it's not just for older people, though I do like how the characters change through their lives. We see these changes clearly through the short interludes, like snapshots, of them at formative moments.<br /><br />I guess it's  possible I liked the characters because I'm in the music business....but for me,  it's definitely one of the best novels I've read this year and I don't say this stuff lightly. If you like stories with happy endings, good guys and bad guys, clear right and wrong----  it's probably not for you.  But if you like complex, interlinked, urban culture stuff, give this book a read.  By the way, I read it on an iPad, and had no trouble with the font......
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Crap.  GL is forcing us to buy the entire 6-movie saga in order to get the 9-disc set!  You don't get the 3 discs of special features if you only buy the original trilogy....and I don't want those crappy prequels in my house!

B003BVK316|3.0|The imagery and lyrical language evoke the Indian landscape beautifully, but for me the prose was too choppy, and the same goes for the plot.  The author tells the story in bits and pieces (\\"small things\\") non-sequentially with insufficient clues sometimes as to whether the main characters, Rahel and her fraternal twin brother Estha, are children or adults.  Also, the death of their cousin Sophie bisects their childhood into before and after.  Sophie's funeral takes place at the beginning, and the rest of the book tells of the events leading up to her death and to the banishment of Estha to live with his father.  One of the repeated themes in the book is that we talk about the small things and leave the big things unsaid.  This truism and numerous other phrases and images, including descriptions of Estha's and Rahel's hairdos, are repeated throughout the book in different settings.  From the title I would think perhaps that this is the story of the small things that comprise the characters' lives, but the horrific defining events are actually quite big things.  The book is supremely sad, and I'll never look at a movie theatre snack counter in quite the same way again.

If you want everything to sound like \\"Is This It,\\" then just listen to \\"Is This It\\" and stop complaining!<br /><br />I don't need or want the Strokes to \\"save rock and roll\\" or do anything but create an album that gets me to press repeat on my mp3 player. And they've done just this, yet again, with \\"Angles.\\"<br /><br />There is certainly a lot of sonic variety here. Previous accusations against the Strokes of \\"sameyness\\" cannot be leveled here. There are more chilly synths, and more electronic percussion noises present here than in other albums. The vocals veer more into falsetto than previously. If anything, it sounds a tad more like Casablancas' solo album \\"Phrazes For the Young\\" than previous Strokes albums. But make no mistakes, this is still a Strokes album. The signature guitar harmony work is here, the precise drumwork, and the distorted vocals all deliver their unique sound. Nick Valensi's guitar solos are more pronounced in this album than in previous ones, and they are really good.<br /><br />In my opinion, there are only two \\"skippable\\" tracks, which is a pretty good ratio out of ten total. Track 7, \\"Call Me Back,\\" is just kind of slow and a downer. Not very rocking, but also not very interesting as a ballad. Track 4, \\"You're So Right,\\" is kind of a droney noise experiment that mostly fails.<br /><br />That said, I frequently just let the whole album play through, because though these are weaker tracks, they are still more enjoyable than Justin Bieber or Katy Perry. And if I'm in the right mood, their slower natures are fine.<br /><br />But the highlights are up there with the Strokes' best. Tracks 1 \\"Macchu Pichu,\\" 2 \\"Under Cover of Darkness,\\" 5 \\"Taken For a Fool,\\" and 8 \\"Gratisfaction\\" are just as rollicking and fun as any previous material. Track 6 \\"Games\\" is a chilly synth piece that works for me. Track 9 \\"Metabolism\\" is reminiscent of some of the more \\"epic\\" tracks from \\"First Impressions of Earth,\\" and it works as well. Track 10 \\"Life is Simple in the Moonlight\\" is the most like Casablancas' solo stuff, which makes sense because he was the primary writer.<br /><br />I've listened to this album now at least a good 30 times. I'm not tired of it yet. At this point, I think people are just whining about the Strokes because they enjoy whining, not because of anything present in the actual music. I hope the Strokes collectively ignore the haters and keep putting out stuff like this, that is sonically interesting and full of variety and experimentation. Anyone who actually enjoys the Strokes should pick this album up, because it delivers everything a reasonable Strokes fan could want. Ignore the masturbatory critical baloney. Give this a spin.\\"epic\\" tracks from \\"First Impressions of Earth,\\" and it works as well.

1423134206|2.0|So, I bought this book, BUT... that is NOT what I expected. I thought there are stuff mostly about character design and it contains a lot of model sheets, but that is mostly background and environment designs.. and these would be OK if they explained how they are working (color patterns, composition, etc), but there nothing like that.. And I was really disappointed by really abstracted designs, it's disney feature animation, not cheap TV series.. SO, I wouldn't recommend buy this book.
0316776963|4.0|I'm not certain if one acquires a taste for David Sedaris, or already has a twisted sense of humor like his, therefore can easily relate to how he assembles and crafts his essays.  Or is it both?  I do have to admit that some of his books are better (more funny......funnier! than others) but this one is a gem.  One of my favorite parts is when he translates verbatim what the students in his French class are attempting to say in French, but with the English translation. I was riding the bus home when I read that and had a very difficult time supressing my laughter so other's wouldn't think I was crazy.  Very funny stuff.    Buy this book and read it.  It's truly well crafted.

B00006RG9K|1.0|This is the worse concert the trio formerly known as &#34;Genesis&#34; ever did. Silly medlies instead of entire songs like Firth Of Fifth and The Musical Box. The rest is just non-Genesis Phil Collins filler trash and a horrible guitar player Daryl Stuermer to top it off! Steve Hackett's The Tokyo Tapes DVD [[ASIN:B00005MM7F Steve Hackett - Tokyo Tapes (Live in Japan)]]was far better where Steve Hackett, Chester Thomson, and others play all the TRUE Genesis classics. Like Watcher of the Skies, Firth of Fifth, In That Quiet Earth, I Know What I Like, Los Endos, Horizons in their FULL versions and lost Rutherford/Hackett classic Shadow Of the Hierophant. And later on [[ASIN:B00FWB6ZBA Genesis Revisited: Live at Hammersmith]] and [[ASIN:B00L9JJTSU Genesis Revisited: Live at the Royal Albert Hall]] are far far better than this trash!!!

B002ZG99N6|3.0|In a part of Boston, Massachusetts, a group of armed robbers loot a bank and take the manager for hostage. This is one of numerous criminal activities Doug (Ben Affleck) engage in, as this is the life they have been used to all along in their low-income neighborhood. Doug slowly develops a relationship with that bank manager, Claire, and wants to leave his crime-infested home and lifestyle to run off with her. The rest of the story you can find out yourself if you choose to watch it.<br /><br />And you should watch \\"The Town\\" at least once if you can. The villains managed to come up with creative schemes to maximize their loot, and the movie made good use of its Bostonian setting. I learned that Charlestown, the neighborhood Doug is from, really had been home to bank robbers and other criminals in the past, so it was pretty refreshing to see a crime thriller based on realistic situations. On the other hand, I didn't feel like enough action happened in the 2 hours I spent watching this movie. I was expecting the plot to be a lot more complicated, as crime thriller movies tend to be, but it wasn't.<br /><br />Overall, it was still a good movie. I might watch it once more sometime but probably not again after that.
B00122MBY8|5.0|The cover perfectly captures this albums sound, it's an image of a introspective Van Morrison in what appears to be an Arcadian bower. The album is flooded with this type of halcyon imagery of 'the barefoot virgin child'; surrounded by 'silence easy' & and a desire 'to be born again/in another world/in another time, these are visions of drifting through 'the viaducts of your dreams' with Morrison living in a dreamtime of happy/sad memories, a fluid jumble of feelings, yearnings & a desire to re-find a feeling of being 'Beside you', is perfectly captured by Van Morrison's fluid singing, a bubbling, babbling brook of soulfulness, wonderfully complimented by the musicians/magicians brought together for the sessions, both singer & musicians createing a loose folk,jazz, blues & soul sound that is utterly timeless, a one off, making Astral Weeks so unique.
B0020TS5LU|4.0|Before there was Downton, there was Gosford. From the writer of the ITV and Masterpiece Theater hit, Downton Abbey, comes Gosford park, a murder mystery set during the \\"inter-war\\" years.     The story itself is almost Christie in nature. This is due to the fact that there is a twist in the end that one could never predict. I will say nothing more than that because I do not want to spoil anything.    The Blu-Ray edition of the film has absolutely no special features and there is literally no menu for the disc, except one for selecting the language track. Therefore, the film begins playing as soon as the disc is loaded. Also, there are no subtitles for any language, although there are a French language track (5.1 Dolby Digital) and two English language tracks (5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 5.1 Dolby Digital). The picture quality is good, but not great. When watching the Blu-Ray, it seemed as if they took a film reel and converted it to high quality digital without cleaning the picture at all. That being said, \\"Gosford\\" looks far better on Blu-Ray than it did on the DVD edition.    It is worth buying Gosford Park in Blu-Ray even if you already own it on another format. The picture is clearer than I've ever seen it and DTS-HD sound (which I had to select from the Pop-up menu) changes the how the entire film sounds. However, expect what you pay for, a high quality copy of a film with good writing, one that has a wonderful cast and is simply beautiful... but nothing more.

1400052181|3.0|The first half of the book is what we are promised by the dust jacket:  interesting information about the woman and the history behind the HeLa line of cells.    The second half, however, devolves into a simple narrative of a road trip that the author went on with the daughter of the book's namesake.  Yawn.  If I wanted to read a heartwarming adventure tale involving a cast of lovable characters, I'd head over to the fiction section of the bookstore.    I definitely learned some interesting stuff, but I could have stopped reading halfway through and been no worse off.
B003L77G10|5.0|A refreshingly pertinent look at the life of an attorney/mother AND various perspectives on marriage and the impact of two careers on that family. Julianna is FANTASTIC.  She plays this role from rather a cool or uncertain perspective.  ALL the players are GREAT.  Chris Noth does a great job, and particularly  the Middle Eastern girl (SORRY--I don't know her name)--she is sassy, smart, and someone you DEFINITELY would want on your side. This show grabs you and you can't let go ! (THIS REVIEW IS FOR SEASON ONE.  2 is not yet available.)

B004OEIL54|5.0|So many will wonder why I claim this is a forgotten classic. I mean isn't the SCREAM mask still sold at Halloween? Haven't we just seen a new sequel released? Isn't the movie spoken of in every Wes Craven interview?<br /><br />All of these things might be true but the fact remains that while SCREAM did do big box office, was sequelized and is talked about at times, I found in watching it again that it was a much better film than I recalled. It was scarier than I remembered. It was better made than I thought at first. And it works on so many levels as to be considered a classic.<br /><br />For those uninitiated the film tells the story of a group of teenage friends. The film opens with Casey (Drew Barrymore) receiving an anonymous phone call with someone who at first flirts with her and then threatens her. In short order she not only witnesses her boyfriend's demise but is soon murdered herself by a killer in a stretched ghost face mask and flowing black tattered robe.<br /><br />The next day the kids at her high school are upset when they hear of the murders. But as teens go they also tend to move on to the next thing that interests them, a true example of A.D.D. Enter our main character Sidney (Neve Campbell), a young woman whose boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich) wants to take things to another level but who remains chaste. Her best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) isn't quite as pure. Tatum's boyfriend Stuart (Matthew Lillard) is the court jester, making jokes at all times. Rounding out this group is Randy (Jamie Kennedy) the nerd of pack who works at the local video store and is a movie fanatic.<br /><br />As the film progresses so does the body count. With each murder we also get a glimpse of the killer and the fact that he seems to be a bit of a bumbler compared to the villains other slasher films have delivered in the past. Where the cool killer reigned in most, this killer trips over his costume, gets knocked in the head more than once and gets downed occasionally only to mysteriously disappear. While choosing to wear a goofy mask this seems like more of what a real serial killer might be like, a klutz who makes mistakes.<br /><br />The cast is rounded out by David Arquette as Deputy Dewey, Tatum's brother and the local goofball policeman. Dewey comes off as little more than a Don Knotts/Barney Fife knock off. But beneath it all lies something more than gets revealed a piece at a time in all of the SCREAM movies.<br /><br />Offsetting this character is Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), a driven newswoman who will do anything to get the story and advance her career. At the moment she is not well liked by Sidney whose life story Gale has pitched on more than one occasion. Sidney's mother was murdered earlier and Sidney has identified Cotton Weary (Liev Schrieber) as the killer. Gale has taken Cotton's side in the matter and has done all she can to get his release much to the displeasure of Sidney.<br /><br />Now the nice part about all of these characters is that each one has a reason to be the killer and the opportunity over and over again. We constantly wonder who the killer is and each time you think you know you find yourself pausing to consider the next person. Is Dewey really hiding his homicidal tendencies behind the goofy façade? Is Gale so determined to get Cotton released that she'd do anything to see it happen? Could Billy have had a reason to become the killer since his mother left him? Every character bops in and out of the scene with ample opportunity to jump back in as the killer.<br /><br />At the heart of this is Randy, the movie nerd, who takes the time at a party to discuss the ins and outs of horror films and \\"the rules\\". So many actually fit any number of films that have been released its hilarious. For instance the rule that if you're a virgin you're safe. Having sex always results in being the next victim. Or never say \\"I'll be right back\\" when leaving a room since it usually results in your chances of returning being non-existent.<br /><br />What makes this movie so good is that it keeps your guessing like the best whodunit ever made. You find yourself thinking it's this person then another then another until you're never quite sure who you think did it. And then result, the reveal, was a tremendous surprise when this film was first released. Even knowing who the killer is doesn't spoil the fun watching it again as you catch the clues left throughout.<br /><br />The movie is also fun because of the in jokes that many movie fans will catch. Names of characters, locations, little aside dropped in all make the movie hilarious with each one. The best one is when high school principal Henry Winkler hears a noise in the hall, sticks his head out and sees the school janitor (played by director Wes Craven) wearing a green and red striped long sleeved sweater who grunts at him, to which Winkler replies \\"Sorry, Fred\\". Yes, a direct reference to Craven's best known film A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.<br /><br />The SCREAM films are being released in blu-ray format for the first time from Lionsgate who recently picked up the distribution rights. They've done a great job with it, just in time for the release of the latest sequel. Best of all its nice to see the film come out in a clean format that means it can be appreciated again for some and for the first time for others. Believe it or not the movie IS fifteen years old now. So if you're watching it with someone who hasn't seen it don't let them know who the killer is, sit back and watch them try to figure it out and enjoy the ride.at it keeps your guessing like the best whodunit ever made.

B00139XSBA|5.0|\\"The Right Stuff\\", the movie, has always been a favorite of mine ever since I saw in the theater when I was 8 years old.<br /><br />I stumbled upon the book, and figured the read would be better than the film because that's usually the case when a book has been converted into a movie.<br /><br />This book, between the writing style, flow and story might just be one of the best books I've ever read--ever. I actually looked forward to going to bed each night just so I could read more.
B004OEIL5O|4.0|One would think that two SCREAM movies would have milked out all of the ideas they had. Then again any fan of horror films, or follower of Randy in the series, would realize that a good horror franchise needs to become a trilogy to be great. Okay forget the new movie and just consider this one for the moment.<br /><br />Gone are the days of school, both high school and college. The survivors of the earlier films have moved on with their lives. Gale (Courtney Cox) and Dewey (David Arquette) were and item but are now apart. Sidney (Neve Campbell) lives in a secluded and secure location where she councils victims via phone. And Cotton?<br /><br />Well as the film opens Cotton (Liev Schreiber) has become a radio talk show host and is on his way home when he gets a call. One of \\"those\\" calls fans of the films recognize by now. The killer is in his home and about to kill Cotton's girlfriend. Cotton races home to stop this but fails and in so doing finds himself the second victim of part 3, his girlfriend being the first.<br /><br />All of this occurs as a film studio is in the process of making STAB 3, the third movie based on the fictional murders in this series of films. I wonder if INCEPTION got their idea for a dream within a dream from these movies within movies? Anyway, Word of Cotton's death reaches the cast and crew and of course Gale is there to cover the story. In her usual insensitive manner she goes looking for the story. It leads her to the studio where the film is being shot and running into Dewey who is a technical advisor to the film, helping Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey) as the character based on Gale.<br /><br />The banter between the two goes back and forth but eventually they work together as members of the cast begin being murdered in the same order their characters are in the script. The killer also keeps leaving behind pictures of Sidney's mother, the woman whose infidelity began this whole story.  He/she also wants to know where to find Sidney.<br /><br />Each cast member as well as studio executives and the police detective in charge of the investigation (Patrick Dempsey) become a suspect at one time or another. Perhaps the only ones not suspects are Sidney, Gale and Dewey. As the cast and crew are whittled down, the revelation of who the killer is this time around and his/her motivations are revealed.<br /><br />It is the revelation that shows how original and interesting this series actually was. Once more they could have taken an easy out or done something that didn't relate to anything. Instead the film works as another whodunit where we are presented with clues that will lead us to the killer if we only pay close attention. Here we are again presented with what could have been a lame excuse for a movie but instead becomes a good little film all in itself.<br /><br />The ideas behind movies are discussed in each of the films. On the surface this is seen when each one discusses the rules found in all horror films. But it also takes on critics who talk about how bad sequels can be, proving them wrong. It talks about how violence affects us by showing that perhaps the violence we see onscreen isn't what causes violence but the circumstances of our lives do. It talks about a press who is willing to sacrifice love, honor and respect for people in the attempt to get the story. And it talks about the fact that while we may make fun of sequels we still fill the theater seats to see them when they come out.<br /><br />The series is well worth adding to your collection if you're a horror fan. Once again Lionsgate has done a bang up job of putting together a quality product here. The extras on all three don't offer much but I for one don't mind. I find that with all the movies I want to watch I rarely have time for these any longer. I mean come on, how come a movie can be 90 minutes long but have 3 hours of extras to watch?<br /><br />Suffice to say that the SCREAM series as released now on blu-ray is a great buy for fans. Now all we have to do is sit back a few months and wait for the release of SCREAM 4.the release of SCREAM 4.
141690977X|4.0|The author makes several valid points; and my biggest take-away was if the guy makes you feel bad about yourself, guilty, or worried or makes you go through any sort of negativity, cut your losses and MOVE ON. yes, some men are shy, some men have parent issues, but most of them think as simply as you would. Its a different, rather simplistic take on relationships, as opposed to the sentimental tomes like 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus'. The end message is clear \\"If the guy likes you, he will definitely treat you well\\"
B004OEIL5E|4.0|Fans of the SCREAM movies will recognize themselves as the geeky Randy who knows so many tidbits of information about movies, horror films in particular. These fans are the ones who show up on opening weekend for a sequel that, chances are, won't be near as good as the original film. Those fans were probably quite surprised with what they got when they went to see SCREAM 2. Where most horror films sequels fail, this one lived up to the first.<br /><br />The time is 2 years after the events of the first film. Those teens who survived are now off at Windsor College, studying and trying to forget the past. If you haven't seen the first film stop reading now and go watch it. I'll wait. If you have you know that the survivors are Sidney and Randy. These two are doing their best to be the regular college students everyone expects.<br /><br />The film opens at a special screening of the movie STAB based on the murders. Young couple Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett (before she was Smith) are there to watch and get more involved than they expected. Epps is killed in the men's room and Pinkett in the theater while a full house runs around screaming with fake knives and ghosts masks thinking its part of the show.<br /><br />Other members of the original cast begin to turn up now. Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) has become a celebrity in her own right having written a best seller about the murders. Now she's back to bother Sidney once more, never thinking of her feelings but simply there to get the story. Cotton Weary (Leiv Schreiber) has been released from prison and is making the rounds of the talk show circuit to cash in as well. He shows as a guest of Gale in the hopes she can catch the first meeting between Cotton and Sidney on film. Then Dewey (David Arquette) shows up fearing that Sidney might be in trouble. Toss in a new boyfriend (Jerry O'Connell), his friend (Timothy Olyphant) and a roommate (Elise Neal) and you have multiple suspects once more.<br /><br />Victims fall over like flies narrowing the possibilities of who the killer is. We know the original killers are both dead and gone, witnessed at the end of the first film. So who's responsible now? And why would they be stalking Sidney? Is it simply that, a stalker influenced by the books and the movie, or is it someone else?<br /><br />This time around the film takes a look at the claims that were made at the time that horror films and slasher films in particular could influence people to repeat the scenes they witnessed on screen. While the proof was never there it made for great defense tactics for lawyers of accused murderers. Its unusual that a film maker like Wes Craven would take up the banner for this argument but he presents a great case here.<br /><br />There were two things I was most surprised at in this film. The first was the number of actors who had small parts here who went on to bigger and better things. Since it's been several years since the film came out I'm not sure if some were big then doing cameos or just getting started. Luke Wilson, Tori Spelling, Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett, Heather Graham, Sarah Michelle Geller, Joshua Jackson, Rebecca Gayheart, Portia di Rosi, Laurie Metcalf and David Warner can all be found here.<br /><br />The second was the fact that even though this film is a sequel it stands up on its own as a truly scary horror film. One would expect the weakest of plot devices to be used in an attempt to cash in on the success of the first film. Instead we have a well conceived idea here as to who the killer is and why. It also ties into the first film rather than one of those oh yeah moments where the reason seems contrived at best.<br /><br />Randy once again tells us what to expect in horror films and sequels in general. And for the most part he's right with one exception. Where he claims that all sequels suck, this movie lives up to the name of SCREAM.ities of who the killer is.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this headset at Best Buy last month to replace my wireless stereo headphones from Creative.  Set up on Windows 7 64-bit was easy. You can auto-mux all your sounds to the headphone, or if you have multiple speakers, mux your ventrilio to your outside source, game to your headphones, etc.  G930 software is a bit basic, leaving you to decide how to advance calibrate presets for games.  The voice morphing software was a nice novelty to mess around with, but ultimately unecessary bloat.  I would have preferred better EQ presets.    I tried these headphones on World of Warcraft, Call of Duty Black Ops, and Battlefield Bad Company 2 for PC.  Easily the best sound out of the three is Battlefield.  The game had several different settings to try out, War Tapes being my favorite as it adds reverberation algorythm and extra bass for explosions.  You could actually hear the rustling of people's clothing while walking around in cut scenes.  Pretty amazing to hear the care their sound engineers put into the game.      However, the reason why most people using gaming headphones are to hear the sound indicators.  For example, there are distinct sounds to hear in shooters like footsteps, or spell abilities being used like in Warcraft.  After fooling with the sound settings in the G930 software, I found bass/ sub capabilities were only apparent in the side (stereo) speakers.  When isolating the front and back portions of the surround sound, they were very tin-can sounding; even with the subwoofer option turned up.  It was apparent emphasis was placed on the stereo portion of gameplay, with little regard for establishing a good center-channel speaker.  When playing shooters, it was hard to distinguish front and back sounds, such as a person walking behind me versus the front.  There is also a slight sound delay from control inputs to actual sound production.  It wasn't enough to be noticable, but running sound through different sources indicated a slight delay in the headphones. After taking the black foam covering the speakers off, it was painfully obvious many of the issues with sound distinction came from the placement of the speakers inside of the headphone.  It appears some of the channels are simulated surround sound, not actual.  It goes to show, headphones are still no substitute to having a good traditional 5.1 surround set up.     Still though the sound isolation, ease of use, wireless characteristics, and bass quality far outweight the G930 drawbacks.  The headphones come with a stereo-surround switch to adjust to stereo programs such as Ventrilio, Winamp and Youtube videos on-the-fly.  The volume knob is conveniently located next to the stereo-surround switch button, making adjustments a snap.  I still haven't found a use for the G-keys, though it is a nice novelty for those who need them.      Provided you have a good sound card, you can source your PS3 / XBOX 360 sound through your computer (via optical in/out), letting you use these headphones for the systems. It can be a real money saver for those who are worried these can only be used via PC.  I've enjoyed these headphones thoroughly for casual gaming, and recommend these for anyone needing a better edge with game sound indicators without the standard 5.1 setup.
B003UESJH4|5.0|There are many times when the film picked for best picture at the Oscars tend to be what many would consider the wrong film. Too often these days the award is given to a prestige picture, a film that no one saw and chances are that they won't even though it won the award. Popular pictures seem to be ignored for more artistic films. This past year saw a marriage of the two, a film that not only entertained and did decent at the box office but that told a solid tale without resorting to simplistic feats. That film arrives on DVD this week, THE KING'S SPEECH.<br /><br />Opening in 1925, the Duke of York, Albert Frederick Arthur George, was the younger of two brothers to King George V. Played here with a combination of weakness and strength by Colin Firth (who won the Oscar for best actor); Albert is a beaten man when it comes to all things royal. He knows his brother is heir to the crown and is fine with that. But he's had a problem since childhood that affects him on a daily basis. He is quite tongue tied with a stammer that impedes him from making any speeches whatsoever.<br /><br />Consulting doctor after doctor with the help of his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) he all but gives up hope. Then she hears of a doctor of a different sort, one who has a record of being able to help each patient sent his way.<br /><br />Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) is unconventional at best. An Australian now in London, he takes on case after case while hoping to land a career in the theatre. With the arrival of Elizabeth and sworn to secrecy, he sets the ground rules. It is he who will decided if he takes the case or not and when in his locale both men become equals. To make his point, he takes to calling Albert \\"Bertie\\", a nickname only members of the royal family have used in the past. While Albert isn't aware, Lionel understands it's not the symptoms that just need treated but the cause as well. And until Albert comes to grips with this, the cure will only be temporary.<br /><br />The two men work on a daily basis as Lionel helps Albert overcome his fears to a certain extent. He does improve but near as much as he would like. Still unable to make a public speech, setbacks occur more often when he's in the presence of his father or his more popular brother, Edward (Guy Pearce).<br /><br />At present Edward isn't quite so popular with his father. Haven taken up with a married woman named Mrs. Wallis Simpson doesn't sit well with either his father or the countries politicians. Should he take on the mantel of King he would also be the head of the Church of England, a church that doesn't believe in divorce or remarrying. And King he does become when his father passes away.<br /><br />Forced to choose between his love of Mrs. Simpson and his duties to his country, Edward rescinds the crown and Bertie is now next in line to become King. With the help of Logue, he makes it through the ceremony and is now King George VI. But fires are burning across Europe. Hitler is on the move and soon makes his play in Poland. And now Bertie must gather together his strength and inspire a nation with a speech. Has all the work paid off or not?<br /><br />Based on the true history of these two men, the film slowly develops not just the story but shows the development of the two men as well. One born into high society and the other the son of a drunk, they have little in common and yet learn more from one another than would be expected. And through their learning they become possibly the best friend that either of them has ever had.<br /><br />Not only did the film win for best picture it also garnered Oscars for best screenplay and best director. It deserved them both. Not only that, Rush should have won for best supporting actor as his part is as important to the story as Firth's character was. Did the film deserve the awards it was given? Most definitely. This is a story that inspires just with the tale alone. There are no outward heroics with guns blazing. Instead we are inspired by the courage of one man to face his fears, to overcome his disability and to become the voice of his nation.<br /><br />The true test to me of a good film is if I would consider watching it again. So many films are fun once but not a second or even third time. This is a film that will remain on my shelf and on occasion come down to be watched again. It truly is that good. It's not just a film that qualifies for a good rental, its worth owning.fears, to overcome his disability and to become the voice of his nation.

B000VIP5L0|5.0|This album is a must have if you're a fan of Black Sabbath. It's an amazing album of stoner metal at it's finest. Like a wall of metal being pulled by a steam roller through your brain! There isn't a bad track on the whole album. Sleep released a couple of other albums, but this was by far their best. I saw Sleep live many years ago in a small club in San Jose. It was one of the best live shows I've ever seen. An onslaught of distorted guitars backed by pounding drums. It rocked! I highly recommend you add it to your metal collection! Enjoy!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love,love, love this CD. Fave song is \\"Our First Time\\". My mom even listened to this CD and thinks its great.

0307593495|3.0|Mankell is a master of the mystery genre. His characters are complex and compelling. This story intertwines the mystery of missing persons, family relationships and personal challenges. I have to say that there where times when the mystery plot didn't seem plausible but in the end it all makes sense. I found the ending very dark and depressing and toally unnecessary way to end the series. I can think of half a dozen scenarios that would have had a similar definitive end to Wallander as detective.[[ASIN:0307593495 The Troubled Man]]

B0015I2P0Y|4.0|I sometimes wonder whether I emphasize my like of difference in music over quality and musicality.  I tend to rate music from artists that create unusual music higher than mainstream artists.  Elbow creates gorgeous and mellow music that is close to the mainstream, but far enough away from the mainstream to be fun.<br /><br />The opening song, \\"Starlings,\\" provided me with my first impression of this CD.  Lead singer Guy Garvey uses plaintive vocals to describe the irony of being deeply in love with someone while denying that love and all the reasons that someone should find someone else.  If there is any question as to how the singer feels, it is with the closing lines:<br /><br />The violets explode inside me when I meet your eyes.<br />Then I'm spinning and I'm diving like a cloud of starlings.<br /><br />Darling is this love?<br /><br />Elbow flavors this song with several unusual features.  Raucous horns startle you against the quiet background; like maneuvering starlings, perhaps?  The drums have an African flavor.  Another instrument I do not recognize might be a glockenspiel, xylophone or carillon, but might be a synthesizer.  The combination of sounds and the soulful background vocals are clever and interesting and demands hearing again to fully appreciate.<br /><br />The song \\"The Bones of You\\" deals with separation and regret.  This time glorious guitars frequently dominate.  I also had to change my impression of this CD because I discovered that all the other songs on this CD were relatively unlike the first.  The pace of this song is much faster and the sound louder than the first song.  Singer Guy Garvey's melancholy tone is perfect for this song.<br /><br />Back to the beginnings of love is the song \\"Mirrorball.\\"  This heavily orchestrated song is a gorgeous symphony of being lost in the moment when you discover you have found your love.  Every syllable sung by Guy Garvey is fully into the feeling of the song and it is nearly impossible to avoid falling into the emotion of the moment.<br /><br />Then comes \\"Grounds for Divorce,\\" a marvelous blues song that has vague reminiscences of Tennessee Ernie Ford.  This grinder provides the title of the CD and is catchy, even though the song itself deals with a tragic subject.<br /><br />In a mellower vein is \\"An Audience with the Pope.\\"  This marvelous song about obsession reminds me a bit of 10CC.  There are lots of interesting instruments, mellow backing vocals and catchy lyrics.  Wait until the too-short guitar-dominated bridge and you will be wishing for more.<br /><br />Frankly, I am not sure what \\"Weather to Fly\\" is about.  On the other hand, the music is so mellow and mesmerizing that perhaps it makes little difference what the song means.  The horns are great.  I could have done without the vocals while the horns were playing, but that is a relatively small complaint.<br /><br />One of my favorite songs is \\"The Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver.\\"  The bass and percussion are so marvelous that I felt more than I understood.  The bridge contains an acoustic guitar and violin or synthesizer bridge portion that is intriguing and fascinating.  This song is one that begs for loudness during the last half.<br /><br />The tempo changes substantially with a ditty called \\"The Fix.\\"  Rarely do groups sing about fixing a horse race, but here it is.  This song is another that reminds me of 10CC.<br /><br />Back in a melancholy vein is the bluesy \\"Some Riot.\\"  The subject appears to be loneliness and possibly alcoholism.  I love the keyboard work on this song, both the piano and the synthesizer.  The vocals during the final portion of this song are great and really make this song a standout on this CD.<br /><br />Elbow seems to love songs that build, and \\"One Day like This\\" builds and builds.  This love song still has a vague melancholy thread, but it is all about being lost in love.  There are moments in this song that have a Beatle's flavor, and it is all good.<br /><br />Closing out this CD is a \\"goodbye\\" song, \\"Friend of Ours.\\"  Most of this song is actually a mellow instrumental that is a very nice coda to this CD.  I always think that songs like these end up making you want to play the CD again, which makes this particular song a double goodbye song since the topic is goodbyes and it is a goodbye to the album.<br /><br />I have read a number of comments that compare Elbow with Coldplay.  I have heard several Coldplay CDs and I enjoy Coldplay, but I think Elbow is more eclectic and creative than Coldplay.  As some reviewers have said, Elbow is what Coldplay could be if they challenged themselves more.<br /><br />Sadly, radio has not been friendly to Elbow in the United States; so much good music and so little exposure.  If you enjoy 10CC, some of Elbow's music on this CD may appeal to you.  If you enjoy mellow music on an eclectic array of subjects with an interesting variety of instruments, then this music could be for you.  I know this one CD has made me a fan and I want more.<br /><br />Enjoy!is a very nice coda to this CD.

B004VD3PE0|4.0|A heartwrenching story told from the perspective of a young girl in her senior year that is trapped between her family who has passed on and her family and friends who remain. Switching between the current time as she clings to life and flashbacks to her younger years, I was entranced by the story. The ultimate question remains what happens if she stays or if she decides to go.<br /><br />My heart was ripped out while reading this book. I couldn't imagine sitting and watching the majority of my loved ones sit vigil by my bedside in a hospital ICU fighting to keep me alive. I absolutely felt her internal struggle as to whether to give it all up to be able to rejoin her parents and brother. A poignant book that makes you take a step back and evaluate who you hold close and what you would do to be with them at all times.<br /><br />I was beyond touched by this book and although the main character was a young senior in high school, I felt as though this book could be read and impactful to any age group. I think everyone could find the heart and the meaning behind this sweet book. Now to start the sequel!
0307272702|5.0|I have battled a weight problem since I was 10 years old. I have been on every diet there is. Joined countless workout clubs. None of these has, even remotely, done what this book has. It has finally explained why I got fat and have stayed overweight most of my adult life. I read this book and started following the simple eating plan. I have done this for a month and have seen my belly fat diminish for the first time in my life and I am not counting calories, watching my portions, instead eating until I am satisfied, or killing myself excercising. So I am a believer, simply because it is working and somebody finally explained to me in simple terms how to eat. How many high priced diets explain that? I can tell you from experience none of them ever did to my satisfaction. So I highly recommend this book if you are sick of being overweight and have not gotten any satisfying answers on what to do! I was amazed reading just how our bodies work and how easy it is to start burning your own fat as fuel. This is one plan I can follow for the rest of my life.

0385512058|3.0|Keith Ferrazzi is a master networker and he believes that you can be too.  Ferrazzi, a graduate of Harvard Business School and former chief marketing officer for Deloitte Consulting and Starwood Hotels & Resorts, discovered early in his career that highly successful people have huge networks.  Who you know is often just as important as what you know.    The first key to networking is to \\"find ways to make other people more successful.\\"  Even in today's cutthroat world of business, generosity is important.  You should also stop keeping score.    You can't amass a network of connections without introducing such connections to others with equal fervor.  The more people you help, the more help you'll have and the more help you'll have helping others.  It's like the Internet.  The more people who have access, and use it, the more valuable the Internet becomes.                Never Eat Alone is filled with refreshing new approaches to relationship building.  Ferrazzi stresses that it's important to reach out to those in your circle of contacts often - not just when you need something.  He suggests meeting with others over breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Never eat alone.  \\"Invisibility is a fate far worse than failure,\\" he writes.                Ferrazzi explains the reason to build a strong web of relationships this way:    The more connections you establish, the more opportunities you'll have to make even more new connections.  As Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet, says:  The value of a network grows proportional to the square of the number of its users.  In the case of the Internet, every new computer, every new server, and every new user added expands the possibilities for everyone else who's already there.  The same principle holds true in growing your web of relationships.  The bigger it gets, the more attractive it becomes, and the faster it grows.  That's why I say that a network is like a muscle - the more you work it, the bigger it gets.In a section called Connecting With Connectors, Ferrazzi notes that for him, certain folks provide links \\"to an entire world of people, ideas, and information that, in a very limited way, has made my own life a little more fun, helped my career along, or made the business I worked for more successful.\\"  Connectors he suggests you cultivate include restaurateurs, headhunters, lobbyists, fundraisers, public relations people, politicians and journalists.    Success isn't based on cool technology or rugged individualism, but on whom you know and how you work with them.  Increase your bottom line by helping friends connect with other friends.  Say goodbye to that dog-eat-dog world and hello to an interdependent world where we need each other more than ever.

B002C6A6FY|5.0|I'm not a big \\"top ten\\" list-maker, but if pressed for an answer, I might have to say that \\"Casablanca\\" is my all-time favorite film... There are a lot of contenders -- \\"Seven Samurai,\\" perhaps -- but it's hard to beat the magic of this grand Hollywood war-noir classic, with its snappy dialog, gauzy black-and-white cinematography and delicious acting.  Plus, it's a great propaganda flick and historical timepiece. Yup, pretty much my favorite.  One downside: I miss the days when you'd see movies like this in the theater and actually have a communal cultural experience with other human beings.  Still, now that I have it on DVD, I looking forward to enjoying it for years to come. We'll always have Bogie and Bacall.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)

B0031ESW5W|5.0|Though it can be gotten for free, I opted for the 99 cent version. I wanted the optimized for Kindle version. Having bought a few books that contained typos, blank lines, and other strange undecipherable garbage in the text, I thought it was worth the nearly 1 whole buck for my viewing pleasure. And I am pleased at the rendering of this book for Kindle.  The book itself is delightful, suspenseful, and as good as Woman in White. It moves at a faster pace than the Woman in White, and is more charming in the narration. Some may prefer the deeper mystery of Woman, but this one is enchanting for its humor. I really enjoyed the servant's (Betteredge) view of the mystery and laughed at loud at his whimsy. (Oh, I now must read Robinson Crusoe again.) If you like a good mystery and wonderful characters you will love this book. Yes, the two main characters (the young lovers) are a bit of a bore, the rest of the cast are well rounded characters that keep you engaged.

It starts off cute with a mother rocking her baby to sleep, and again when he's two, and again when he's 9.... Then a teenager. The most disturbing part was when the son grew up and moved out, and the mother drove to his house in the middle of the night and snuck in through his window and rocked this grown man while in his bed. This is very weird to me. Not at all what I was expecting and I plan to return it.

You would be wise to ignore it, and instead pay more attention to the reader's reviews.    \\"The Circuit\\" brings to mind today's online dating service.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|In the remote realm of Asgard, young Thor is heir to the throne, but is arrogant with a quick temper. When Thor's misguided actions cause the end of an unsteady peace between the Asgard and Frost Giants, King Odin banishes Thor to Earth. Thor is found by scientist Jane Foster who studies the skies. Without his powers, Thor is forced to live as a mortal and learn what it means to be a true hero.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth takes on the iconic role of Thor, the god of thunder. Hemsworth not only looks the part of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Nordic god, but he plays the part of haughty, spoiled young prince to perfection. Unlike most other superhero origin stories, Thor doesn't go through much physical change. Instead, he grows as a man and a champion for others, learning humility and self-sacrifice.<br /><br />They couldn't have found a better actor to play Odin. Anthony Hopkins shines in whatever he does, and as Asgard's wise and benevolent leader is no exception. And Thor's malicious and manipulative brother Loki is played by Tom Hiddleston to creepy perfection. Natalie Portman costars as Jane Foster, Thor's human love interest. I was skeptical at first, but the two did have great chemistry. And Jane's small team of scientists including Stellan Skarsgard and Dr. Selvig and Kat Dennings as Darcy added a fun dynamic of humor and simplicity. Whereas, Thor's friends from Asgard are a bit cartoonish and over-the-top.<br /><br />The main story takes place on both present day Earth and on Asgard, moving at a steady pace. At 1 hour 54 minutes long, I expected there to be some slower scenes or the story to be drawn out. Instead, it felt like the movie flew by, and it was suddenly over too soon. The action scenes were intense, with incredible special effects. The drama was balanced well with humor. Full of mystery, suspense, adventure, and a bit of romance - I loved every minute of Thor. Comic book and superhero fans of all ages will enjoy this cosmic adventure. I saw this sneak preview on a regular screen, but in 3-D. I highly recommend the 3-D experience, with the fantastic special effects; it really pulls viewers into the action scenes. Though, I do wish there were a more comfortable option than those annoying plastic 3-D glasses.

B004VJDXUK|5.0|I bought this album in London last winter before it was available in the USA. I have to say since I bought it I return to it over and over. I have had the chance to see Jonas Kaufmann at the Met now twice and everything I loved about his earlier recordings is even more true for him in person. A striking voice with such power and masculinity. The voice took me by surprise the first time I heard it, but I just adore it now and think he is the tenor of the moment and will likely be for the decade or two. The literature on this album is stunning and Mr. Kaufmann's voice is perfect for the heartfelt and wildly emotional and somewhat dramatic flavor found in the Verismo arias. Do yourself a favor and buy this album right now!

One of my favorite albums of all time, though I understand not all share my enthusiasm - an acquired taste perhaps.  Not only is the Rhino packaging really nice, but the real mind-blower here is THE SOUND!  And that's what's really important, after all, right?  On my first listen to the first track I heard vocal harmonies and subtle guitar parts I have never before heard.  Astonishing!  And certain passages where the music and Jon's singing peak at the same time, all of my previous copies -- vinyl, cassette, CD -- have exhibited marked distortion.  That is gone.  Complete sonic clarity.  At last.  Right on.

B003ITDN86|4.0|Another crafty and brilliantly written release from Sum 41, yet also a little different in sound from their previous two releases \\"Chuck\\" and \\"Underclass Hero\\".  The title track and the trio of continuous tracks in the middle of the release (tracks 7,8,9) are standouts for me.  The music continues to be creative and lyrically real to life.  Best album I've heard in quite a while.
B0042RUMH8|5.0|I love love this CD,JLO FAN OR NOT,IT IS A.WELL PRODUCED..WELL SUNG CD.Great job with dance songs \\"On the floor\\",Invading My Mind\\" etc..as well R&B and Pop songs..i recommend if jlo fan... deluxe edition..which is even better!If not a big fan..regular Cd is just a good start and is great!
B000X418UE|5.0|i loved this movie the first time i saw it. It's a star studded cast with a bunch of actors before they hit it big. The movie arrived within the week.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|As a fan of this genre looked forward with great expectation of this, and wasn't disappointed,iconic imagery and great acting and a back story of the characters involved that makes you want them to win out.    One of the strengths of season one is the attention to detail in the sets you really get the impression that battle was fought for example in the grounds of the centre for disease control.   Recommended viewing intelligent well scripted dramatic.
B000WLO01M|3.0|I've been on a huge Elliott Smith kick, since I discovered him 3 months ago.  He's pretty much the only artist I'm listening to right now.  I like him that much.  So far, I've listen to XO, Ether/Or, Roman Candle, and now Figure 8.  XO is still my favorite album thus far (Ether/Or just slightly behind it), as there are so many memorable songs on it.  I've read alot of the other reviews here as well as the reviews on Pitchfork and AllMusic.      Here's my take on Figure 8.  There's nothing wrong with the production, as it's very similar to XO (I know some of the bad reviews for this album were from people that were used to the rawness of the earlier albums).  To me, it's simply that the songs in general aren't all that well written or memorable.  Don't get me wrong.  There are no real clunkers here.  And there are are few song here and there that stand out ((Everything Reminds Me of Her, Everything Means Nothing to Me, Stupidity Tries, Wouldn't Momma Be Proud, Color Bars, Happiness).  But I just don't find myself wanting to return to these songs over and over like I've been doing (and still doing) with XO.      Some people might say that it's not fair to compare the two albums.  But the two albums have a similar production and musical style.  So I can only fault the songwriting of Figure 8 for the reason I don't want to consistently return to it.      I just started listening to New Moon and I'm already finding that the songs I've heard (all previously unreleased) seem more tuneful than most of what Figure 8 has to offer.  I am still very much looking forward to hearing the rest of Blue Moon, as well as hearing the rest of his catalog.    My advice to anyone that likes this album AND hasn't listen to the rest of Elliott's catalog - I strongly recommend you go back and listen to the earlier albums.
0596009208|5.0|I completely love reading this book. It is just so well written and explains each and every concept clearly. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn java from basic. I won't say it covers all the advance topics but it is great book. One word for this book is AWESOME!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I can't believe Lucasfilm's inability to understand it's fans. The original trilogy, in it's original unaltered form, is my \\"holy grail\\" of movies. They are at the top of my list of films to see on BR, but they are the only ones not available. Everything else I want to see in HD is available, or soon will be. Don't give me any crap about the SE's, those are NOT the original films.    This has nothing to do with the perceived quality of the SE's. It's about more than just my childhood memories, it's also about history. The original films, ANH especially, are milestones of cinema. Their original forms should be presented in the best quality possible, with the same attention to detail  as the PT and the SE's.     I'd pay for the complete saga if necessary, to get them. But if they are not available, I will not spend a dime on it. Lucasfilm has gotten plenty of my money over the years. If they want more, give me what I want. I'll not clutter my shelf with a set I consider to be incomplete, at any price.
B001QWBM62|4.0|I purchased this recorder an year back mainly for the purpose of recording our Choir's performance. It is a very good recorder and the multi-channel is very handy for recording through the built-in mic and from the mixer output. I have found that the built-in mics quality is good enough only for recording the practice sessions. For actual performance it is better to record using external mics (or from the amps mixer).  The controls are pretty intuitive.  The product is not very rugged - but if you handle carefully can last.  The battery life also is very good.  Controls are in such a way that even a novice user can record with basic features - but as you learn more you can use more sophisticated controls.  Overall I am very happy with this product with slight disappointment on the quality of the mics -but then for this price I think we can't hope for better mics as well.

B00000ILDF|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />Alien 3 and Alien Ressurection were always my favorite.  To me they were true sci fi.  They had cool characters, great visuals, and a good plot.<br /><br />Alien 3 is great watching the assembly cut that came in the quadrilogy box set.  It was over 30 minutes longer and had a lot more plot and character development and seemed like a complete movie.<br /><br />The theatrical version is still great but I like the extended one a lot more.<br /><br />Anyway the visuals were great for early nineties and I think it was one of the first movies to have a little computer generated effects at the time.<br /><br />The visuals of the refinery on the prison planet were great.  Just look at the size of the sets.  Some look like they are 50 ft tall.<br /><br />The look of the alien was different and cool.  As the behind the scenes put it sort of like a mix with a jaguar and a freight train.<br /><br />Also the acting was top notch.  I liked Ripley the best in this one.  I liked the shaved head!  Also Charles Dance as the docter and the black guy who used to be on that show the rock were great.<br /><br />Anyway I recommend all the alien movies.  Sci Fi is done lately pretty bad.  Movies like this were relatively low budget but the people involved were so devoted that they made the movies good.  I think the only good sci fi ones I have seen recently were Doomsday and Terminator Salvation.<br /><br />Kevin
0920668372|5.0|I had forgotten all about this book until I happened to spot it at the elementary school that I work at. I had a few minutes to spare, and decided to quickly thumb through the book for old time's sake. At almost 20 years old, by the time I finished this book, my eyes were filled with tears and I had a lump in my throat the size of a golf ball. This is one of the best children's books ever published. As soon as I finish writing this review, I'm going to order it and have it sent to my 2 year old niece :)    Anyone who thinks that this book is creepy needs to get over themself. The touching part isn't the LITERAL rocking a grown man to sleep. It's the CONCEPT of loving your child no matter how old they are, no matter how annoying they can be, no matter where they live. If you're not smart enough to figure out the main concept of a children's book, maybe you shouldn't be passing your less-than-average-intelligence genes on...
0141000198|5.0|I just had to order my second copy as I'd worn out my first paperback. Love this book. It never gets old.
031261246X|4.0|I was very excited to see that super-geek Mark Russinovich has taken a foray into cyber-techno-thriller genre. Mark's application of the depth of his understanding of technology to an exciting and timely plot made for a read that was very difficult to put down. I highly reccomend this book if you like fast paced thrillers and believeable technological challenges.    Overall, I would rate the book 4.5 stars. The main reason for 4.5 is that I would have loved to share this book with younger geeks that I mentor. However, the adult relationships within the story had some exciting times that I was not quite ready to share with youngsters. I think that this book would make a great R rated movie.
0425241505|5.0|Dragon Bound by Thea Harrison  Paranormal Romance -May 3rd, 2011  5 stars     Dragon Bound is the first in a fresh, complex and compelling new world of shifters (wyrs), Fae and magical creatures.    Pia Giovanni has always been on the run. She has been hiding her heritage and fears for her safety constantly. But now she just did something really stupid and is probably going to pay with her life very soon. Pia is being blackmailed by her scum bag ex-boyfriend because she inadvertently told him something secret about herself. Something she is desperate to keep hidden. As a result, she finds herself stealing something from a hoard owned by the powerful Elder and dragon wyr, Dragos.    Dragos is not known for his sensitivity or forgiveness and he wants the thief who stole from him found and punished! But something unexpected happens when Dragos hunts her down. He is fascinated by her and curious about a woman who is bold enough to try and succeed in stealing from him. Soon he finds Pia's fierce spirit makes him laugh. And that he wants to keep Pia as part of his treasure. Unfortunately, Pia has a heart and mind of her own, plus secrets that could kill her. Can she trust a dragon known for his temper with her life even if she is attracted to him, too?    Words cannot express how good this book was! The author does a fantastic job of creating a fully fleshed world that just pulls you in more and more. The characters vary from outrageous to stoic but all are well developed and fun to read! Although Pia and Dragos are the two main characters. I loved reading about the rest of the cast which finally gave Pia a warm and welcome home. The gryphon wyrs and the devilishly audacious Tricks are particularly fascinating. (I cross my fingers that all of them will eventually get their own book?!)    Dragos was also a hoot. He is bored with life. He has lived hundreds of years without anything to challenge or surprise him. But when he discovers that there is a thief that is bold enough to actually succeed in stealing from him, well, he is determined to find her. He surprised at how much how likes the cheeky thief and decides to 'keep' her. It was fun to read Dragos try to be romantic and his confusion at wooing Pia.    Spectacular, surprising and magical with a fully developed world.  Readers are bound to find one character that fascinates them. I loved this book and look forward to the next with great anticipation!    Reviewed by Steph from the Bookaholics Romance Book Club
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I give it two stars because I enjoyed the story.  I will not read any of the other books but basically there are only a couple decent people in the story and by the end of the book you are left with people of very bad character or children.
B003IY49S4|5.0|I'm writing this review just so that there is at least one review - I usually don't review but I thought this item needed it! The jazz recordings in this collection are top rate - Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Chet Baker etc. and the sound is excellent. For the present price it is under 2 dollars a CD which is such a bargain for such good music. The music dates from the 50's to the 80's and all are items in Sony/Columbia/RCA Victor's catalog along with some European issues. There's a good mix of vocal, small group, big band, be-bop, swing, cool, and fusion.
0307477479|5.0|Having been enchanted by Jennifer Egan's short stories in The New Yorker (which make up part of this novel), I couldn't wait to read more of her writing. This book not only doesn't disappoint; it is so good that it's an impossible act to follow; you don't know where to turn for your next read.    The book consists of chapters written from the different points of view of many intersecting characters, linked in one way or another to the punk music business; and the chapters skip around in time. It requires some page-flipping to remind yourself who is who, but it's rewarding work: there is a perfect web of people and themes which come together if you stay alert.    Egan has said her subject is time, which is the goon of the title; and indeed, the passage of time/intersection of people in real life feels very much like the way this book depicts it. Connections are made and broken, then remade; people are lost and found. Broken souls sometimes mend, after a fashion, and high-flying souls are brought low, but not always all the way down. Time is a goon, and it spares no one.    There is so much to praise about this author: her incandescent language, her dialogue that sounds so real, even when spoken by people you might not normally overhear; her tone that is funny and alarming and deadpan by turns. Characters in the book meet with longing and tragedy and no scarcity of awkward moments, but the story just clips briskly along, and you are treated to dazzling images and lucid portraits. Here is Uncle Ted observing his runaway niece Sasha: \\"Her face was fragile and mischievous, pale enough to absorb hues from the world around her--purple, green, pink--like a face painted by Lucien Freud.\\"    And although the book is highly stylized--all those points of view including demented ones, one chapter delivered as a Powerpoint presentation--the style fits the story to perfection. Lives are fractured, people are wayward, time plays tricks on us.    You marvel at the depth of Egan's grasp of the personalities and language of the pop music world--what a treat to go so far inside it and still be a spectator--and the dazzling way she turns it into a metaphor for the elation and danger and fracturedness of life itself.
B000026FUH|3.0|I received the cd that i ordered but the booklet was only 4 pages. I bought the cd because the one i have skips. The artwork on the cd itself is not what the original artwork is. This one didnt have a picture, it only had the artist name and the title... It would be nice if the description said something about it. Overall, it looks like a cheap copy of the original...

B0045TQF88|2.0|When I first heard this was coming out, I was hoping that the bonus disc was going to be Rainbow's performance at Castle Donnington since part of their performance was release years ago on the Castle Donnington record. Despite the fact that that wasn't included, I bought the disc hoping that these \\"instrumental Outtakes\\" would be worth it. When the disc arrived, The first thing I noticed was that the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" sleeve has been replaced by some cheesy deluxe edition tape sealed around the bottom of the CD packaging. I cut it carefully afraid that if I removed it it would damaged the CD packaging. I then immediately played the CD's. The first disc sounds no better than the original remastered version. O.K. fine.. Then when I played the second disc, it was nice to hear the instrumental versions, but truth be told they really sound like Karaoke recordings. The last insult is the \\"Cozy Powell Mix\\" of \\"All night Long\\" This is just a remixed version with the drum parts at complete full max. So if you are a Rainbow fan by all means buy it to complete your collection. But if you are an average listener, stay with the original.
0446691437|5.0|Pressfield has produced a book stripped of any fluff (but thankfully, not stripped of perspective and humor). Some pages will have only one or two sentences...but well-crafted sentences that get right to the point.<br /><br />In a way it's like a book of aphorisms, except these are not the usual gauzy fortune cookie stuffers that make up so many self-help books. These thoughts are written on the tip of a boot and applied with requisite force.<br /><br />I hesitate to recommend it to many people because I want to keep the supply of people with unexamined lives available to do the scut work. If too many people learn the lessons contained in this book there won't be many left to work in the cubicles and take out the trash. In that sense, this is a truly subversive book.
0307887960|3.0|If you stick to this diet, you will very likely lose weight; you will on any highly restrictive diet. The gimmick in the Dukan is very large amounts of water and oat bran. This will fill you up and possibly will absorb some fat.<br /><br />The diet is several week-long cycles with a selection of vegetables. Fruit is NOT allowed, but oddly enough, wine and dessert are allowed as cheat-days, possibly to avoid you feeling like grabbing that tempting donut and to deal with lifestyle--a person has to live, after all.<br /><br />This is considered \\"The French Atkins\\" meaning high protein/fat, low carb so we've seen this before. You should not sustain yourself on a diet like this, nor is it a way to retrain your eating. Having said that, the slim Duchess of Cambridge lost a lot of weight in a short time before The Wedding, so if you must, see your doctor.
B004X4QW42|3.0|First one was spectacular this one kinda lets you down if you just watched the first. Seems like the creators tried to mix too much rocky in there.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Many great films of the world are treated to definitive collections by companies like Criterion.  Given the scale and global impact of Star Wars, it seems like with the advent of Blu Ray now is the time for Lucasfilm and Fox to release a Star Wars set on par with what Peter Jackson did for Lord of the Rings.      Unfortunately, this is not the case.  As with previous releases, little care or work at all has gone into the new BR releases.  Not only the actors, but the creators of Star Wars act like they're tired of/embarrassed of/sick of Star Wars, and can't even find the time to do proper commentary tracks.      Save your money.  These films were never meant for HD or the home theatre anyway.

0385341008|3.0|I see this is a popular book and has nearly 1000 5-star reviews.  I enjoyed reading this collection of letters, however, I would not place it in the 5-star category.  Please reserve the 5 stars for the greatest books ever!<br /><br />I knew nothing about the German occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II and I enjoyed learning about this.  I think the descriptions of Guernsey are very nice and they make me want to visit and learn more about the island.<br /><br />Something bothers me about the characters in this story.  Some are light and silly.  Some are serious and brooding.  Some are quirky.  And some are selfless and good.  But they all seem one-dimensional.  (Does it remind anyone else of the characters on Mayberry RFD?)  Perhaps the point of the story is merely to have symbolic characters, not realistic ones.  The seriousness of the war and the Holocaust, however, do not seem to mix well into this fluffiness.<br /><br />The literary references are fun and they make me want to re-read Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre.  I even did a little research on Charles Lamb and the Brontë sisters and liked learning more about them.<br /><br />So, just an okay read but I'm glad I read it, even if it's simply to know what everyone is talking about

0553582038|5.0|Most \\"A Song of Ice & Fire\\" fans I speak with - and most reviews I read - consider this the weakest entry into the series.  I wholly disagree.  For one, it's impossible to call any installment in this series \\"weak\\".  If you want to compare Mr. Martin with Mr. Martin in making a point for what is your favorite book in the series, that's fair.  But the blunt fact is still that with whatever this novel is lacking, you'd be more satisfied reading it than most any other fantasy book outside of the series.    More importantly, this book fulfills its purpose.  AFFC was intended to represent falling action; it succeeds \\"A Storm of Swords\\", which was almost entirely non-stop climax.  SoS had a very conclusive feel and effectively ended the first partition of this series, the War of 5 Kings.  AFFC is about re-setting the board, introducing new characters, and examining the catharsis inside each of the protagonists.  It would be overwhelming and inordinate to demand a continuation of the epic-scale drama portrayed in \\"A Clash of Kings\\" and \\"A Storm of Swords\\".    This book succeeds in unveiling a new foundation for the second half of the series.  Furthermore, as it only deals with half of the primary players, I think it would be more appropriate to jointly review AFFC and the forthcoming \\"A Dance with Dragons\\".  Here's to July 2011!

B0036EH3U2|4.0|I wanted to re-write this review into a more concise format.  Battlestar Galactica is an epic series. I had seen it before purchasing this set. But this is a review of a DVD product and not the TV series. My issue is with the navigation of the Blu-ray set.<br /><br />If you watch only one episode at a time, every time you start an episode, you are accosted with the \\"I'm Micheal D. Moore\\" intro.  I could see this once per season or even once per disc, but it gets old with every single episode.<br /><br />The other annoyance (and this is true of many collections), is that instead of returning to the next unseen episode on the menu, this collection just returns.  I like sets that realize you probably will want to view the next episode rather than watch the same one again, so highlight that one in the menu.  It's also nice if you come back later and your player has a resume feature, so you know exactly where you left off.  Even if you start an episode with this set and stop it, the resume will not work.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|this set is only the CGI-altered version of the films.  Heaven forbid we get the original releases.  Can't wait until we see the Lucas CGI updates of Citizen Kane (where Rosebud is a CGI Ewok) and Gone with the Wind (where Scarlett shoots at Han Solo first).  C'mon.  You know in a couple years, Lucas will....shocker...re-release this again as a blu-ray set that will include both versions.  Don't get sucked in and just save your money for the next release which will inevitably have both versions...
B000LT2IHI|2.0|My daughter received this as a gift for Christmas, and we (and the gift-giver) thought it was adorable.  She was only 3 months at the time so we held on to it, and we actually opened it for her to play with when she was 6 months old so she was still a little young for it, but she's also a little ahead of her developmental age-group.  She almost immediately used it to go from sitting to standing (yup at 6 months) and while it was sturdy enough for her to do this at 6 months, she's now 7 months it tips quite frequently.  She loves the noise it makes when you either push the button or \\"feed\\" a ball, however its REALLY difficult to get the ball in the mouth, especially for her little hands (you have to get it to fit just \\"so\\" and push it past a trigger to make the noise).  Also disappointing was the slide the ball goes down seems to lend itself to helping with the pulling-up process, but is too cheaply made and was immediately bent out of alignment.  Now when you get the ball in the giraffe's mouth, it only goes halfway down the chute.  I'm also not a fan of the random nature of the balls, and the fact that every time she reaches for one in the tray, it shoots back in and disappears into another tray (not enough of an angle for the exit ramps).  It's frustrating for her and aggravating for me, and really teaches no skills that couldn't by learned without it.  The best value of this toy is the balls - she loved the blue one and learned to crawl by chasing after it - again, I'm quite sure this same trick could be learned by chasing after raquetballs.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Ah, a movie I actually had to think about - what an amazing concept!<br /><br />Would you want to go into someone else's dreams?  Or have them in yours?  Would you want to influence their future actions while you were in there?<br /><br />I, for one, don't want anyone walking around in my dreams, although being in theirs might be enlightening.  In this tech age so much of our lives are out in cyberspace for others to see.  Our thoughts - and dreams - are kind of the last frontier of what only we ourselves can see.  And for how long?  Will the ideas brought forth in \\"Inception\\" be viable one day in the not too far future?  Hmmm...<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie - plot, special effects, casting.  It all worked and lived up to the hype I had heard about it.
B004E547D8|5.0|We were already laughing out loud at this movie when a scene came up that we all said, \\" He didn't just do what I think he just did, did he?\\".   It was unbelievable!

B0041KKYEM|3.0|When I rented Black Swan, I thought I was in for a comedy featuring an all African-American cast. Boy, was I wrong. There are no black people in this movie, so I don't know why it was called Black Swan. However, I watched the whole movie anyway even though the title is a rip-off. Mila Kunis is sexy in it. And there is plenty of weirdness in the movie, if you like that kind of thing. It kind of reminded of a David Lynch movie, and I'm not a fan of Lynch so I'm not a fan of this movie. It was never too boring, though. It was just weird. As weird as my friend Nathan, who is 29 years old and still wets the bed.

0061733199|5.0|This book resembles both my Army Manuel, and boy scout handbooks combined, and loaded with about 10 times more useful information.     Moms and Dads, this would make a good gift for your kids. It's also HIGHLY advise putting your kid into the scouts. Just hand in there during the cubscouts, because it's a lot of carebear stuff, but it will slowly prep them for the boyscouts. In the boyscouts they will learn a lot. It prepped me for my 3 years in the Army.    Now I am capable of being a survivalist in my local region. Mind you, I live where plants are lush, water is clean, and wildlife thrives, but that still requires a lot of learning. Also something to add to this book is another book on edible plants and medical plants and herbs for your region. Do you research and find out which plants are there to help you, and which to avoid. This book is limited on it's plant and herb info simply because it's broad information couldnt handle another 1,000 pages on it.     For those 90%ers that are just waking up, do your research on the SHTF scenarios. If you didn't know it, there is a lot of hype about zombie invasions and how to prepare. That zombie invasion is an actual front (underground term) for a SHTF event that may or may not occure. Another words, 90% of the population is a mindless \\"zombie\\", because they will infact take from you, the 10%er because you were prepared for it.     Don't be that 90%er that has to resort to zombie tactics.     -Tony \\"Macaroni\\" Bologna

0913866156|5.0|I highly recommend this deck!  There is no question in my mind that it deserves 5 stars.  However, they were designed with a certain philosophy in mind, as well as a certain purpose.  The deck is very MALE...not masculine...but MALE!  This deck tends to resonate with men disproportionately and serves to awaken and stir deep feelings of masculinity and maleness in the men who use it.  I know plenty of women who also love this deck, however...especially those who are Crowley fans.  The cards are usually used less for divination and more for meditation or education on principles of Western Esotericism as understood by Crowley.  Having integrated so much symbolism into each card (color, numerology, astrology, alchemy, theology, mythology, Kabbalah, Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, Golden Dawn philosophy, Thelema, Hinduism, Egyptian wisdom, Enochian magick, etc.) the cards become more than the sum of their parts, and even mystics, such as my self, with beliefs that are quite divergent from Crowley's can learn much about themselves and the world through the potential lessons contained therein.  The cards are larger than most, and the imagery is more vivid.  The cards were actually designed to evoke certain states in the user...be prepared for an emotional response to the cards.  This deck is also historically and culturally significant as it is probably the second most widely used deck, and more influential than the Rider-Waite deck because it carries a (sometimes pedantic) philosophy with it that informed much of Western culture after World War II (though indirectly).  Your favorite politician's favorite rock star's favorite author's favorite intellectual was probably influenced by this deck and its creator, whether you realize it or not.  Through use of this deck, you are tapping into a stream of culture that is not necessarily right or wrong, but significant and relevant at the very least.    I would recommend buying this deck in conjunction with a book that explains some ofCrowley's (highly misunderstood) ideas.  Anything by Lon Milo DuQuette is a good start.  He does a good job of sifting through Crowley's irreverent and inflammatory cries for attention to get at the essence of his more sincere ideas.
B004SQS9FA|2.0|I have admired Radiohead for a number of years as a Band that could impress me with intensity and wonder.  The music they have released since Ok Computer has been much more exploratory than their early work, but always good if not great. So much so that I would always by the latest Radiohead album without hearing it.  With The King of Limbs I feel they have derailed themselves and given us as fans a D- effort.  On Kid A and Amnesiac they used combinations of sounds and music to convey emotion with a huge amount of range.  Sometimes the sounds were disruptive and difficult to listen to, but they theme of the music was strong and in place.  Hail to the Thief saw them return to some of their root as a band while In Rainbows was strong from beginning to the end.  The King of Limbs feels mostly like noise for the sake of noise.  It is as though the band slapped their names on a group of incomplete ideas that they were going to abandon anyway.  I bought the MP3 download for five dollars and still feel ripped off.  I hope the next Radiohead album is a demonstration of the musical brilliance that has taken up so much room on my hard drive and not a product that will be hitting my delete cache.
B000026KG7|5.0|I own this CD and probably heard it first (Vinyl) around '70/'71.<br />I loved it right away and did my early trippin' to it. What memories!<br />As the other reviewer said, this stuff beats out the following more<br />commercial material. The sound quality is the best you're gonna get.<br />It amazes me how the original tapes have held up after 35/40 years.<br />If you like acid rock with a few twists (the Donovan song \\"Lalena\\")<br />you will be glad you made this purchase. Go for it!<br />Breadmanwalking.....
1423101464|5.0|The penultimate book in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series shares all the features that have made this series such a pleasure to read. It has imaginative modernization of classical mythology, likable and capable protagonists, wonderful humor mixed with doses of tragedy and pathos, all told in the sardonic first person by Percy Jackson. In addition we have the Labyrinth itself - virtually alive and as much a gripping and interesting character as any flesh and blood mortal, monster, god, or demigod. The action sequences are well choreographed and the overreaching plot and subplots that run through the entire series are pushed towards what promises to be an page turning climax.<br /><br />After I finished this book I immediately ordered the Last Olympian and some other Riordan titles. This is a juvenile series but I'm thinking there are plenty of adults like me that are having a blast following this fun series. Highly recommended.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|the 1st season was slow but by the end it became   more and more interesting.   i just couldnt stop watching.   this is not a show you can wait for next week to see.   only on dvd or down load. you will find your self saying lets watch another and another.  my wife doesnt like si-fi, but she likes this show as much as me!.   it appeals to a wide range of people.   the story becomes even better in the 3rd series.   cant wait to see the end of s3.  look on IMDB at the ratings people have voted.   10/10 for 12,000 votes. that really says something.!!!  hope ive convinced you into having a great experience   that will leave you with that thought that there is something better than metiocraty.

B00364K6YW|5.0|As far as I am concerned, there is no other film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  True to the book and in full blown Austenian style, this film is more than worth the time.  Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy!  The beauty, charm, and wit of Jane Austen come through clearly in the superior performances of the actors.

B004OC07N0|5.0|As someone about to jump up the hierarchy into a new management role, I find the content of The First 90 Days to be really useful. I'm not normally a sucker for management how-to books, but this one reeled me in.     I bought the Kindle version of this book for my iPad, and I am unhappy with the poor electronic formatting of this book. The text is fine, but the tables are a mess to the point of being almost unusable. I am a big fan of e-books, but formatting matters.
1416583432|2.0|Yea put me in the could not finish column too. I live on an island with 3 dogs and spend most of everyday outside with them and the more I read this book the more I thought, nah, not what my dogs are knowing. Her intuition about what dogs are thinking and feeling is filtered through her own dog who is mostly waiting for her to come home and take her outside for a walk. A few interesting facts that I could have looked up on the internet but not worth a book.   CW
0670022411|5.0|i really love this book.  i saw it in the bookstore and was drawn in by the cover.  later, i ended up buying it for my kindle but i am seriously considering buying the hardcover as well!  intriguing characters and an interesting plot keeps you into the book the whole way and leaves you wishing you had the next book in hand!  there is a lot of history interwoven into the book and it really adds flavor.  all in all, very good, completely worth reading.
B00008Y3VA|3.0|I love Uriah Heep (even the newer version - I'll be attending their upcoming Atlanta show) and saw them a lot back in the day. My favorite Heep song has always been \\"Bird of Prey\\". Why, then, is the version on this CD not the original? It's pretty bad, with the vocals sounding like Mrs. Miller channelling Tiny Tim. I was pretty shocked when it came across my speakers, considering how good everything else sounds. Did they lose the original master, or was it destroyed? Anyway, you'd be better off getting \\"Classic Heep\\", where all versions are intact.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I agree with the sentiments here.  George, the ORIGINALS WITH 5.1 surround sound mixes.  STOP being such a cry baby about how much you hate the originals and realize your FANS are the ones who LOVE them so much.    After all, without the FANS, you'd just have had another THX1138 on your hands as far as popularity goes...      1 star only until you correct your error of a lifetime.
B003KHMX32|5.0|I'm very glad my friends turned me on to breaking bad, as the show starts pretty well, and only seems to get better.  But I have to say that the episode One Minute is one of the best of the series, and features one of the top 2 or 3 most harrowing scenes I've ever seen on a TV show.  I was absolutely frozen watching the last minute of this episode.

0307454541|3.0|**Warning Contains Spoliers!!**<br /><br />I really wanted to love this book, but everything just came up short. The financial components in the story were just plain boring to me and I found myself to be skipping through those portions. I understand the Wennerstrom affair was a large part of the story but I found it to only be a means to an end (getting him to Headstead) and how the affair wrapped up was too simple and perfect. If Wennerstrom was really a \\"financial gangster\\" all of his information would not have been kept on one computer and he would not have just been sending e-mails willy nilly. It really made the story unbelievable.<br /><br />I usually do not read murder mysteries so that may be the reason I did not particularly enjoy all of the action taking place on Headstead. As soon as I understood who all the characters were in the Vanger family I pretty much knew who the killer was. The Vanger family to me had too many members that we had to remember. You could have cut half the people from that family and mentioned them maybe only once and the book would have been better for it!<br /><br />Above all what forced me to give this book 3 stars was the fact that Harriett Vanger was still alive. That was another Wennerstrom style cop-out that wrapped up too easily. I'm sorry but if someone is alive someone will find them, especially if Anita knew the whole time. Not only that after Harriett had been hiding out for so many years she just decides that now that Martin is dead she will come back and run the Vanger Corporation. I was dumbfounded reading the ending of this book and was left feeling unsatisfied.<br /><br />Needless to say I will probably not be picking up The sequel as it is probably more of the same boring financial intrigue and murders that are solved way too easily.
B001L1S1SK|2.0|I was left from the awesome season two by this cliff hanger that made me want to cry in frustration but when season three arrived at my home I was dissapointed entirely. THis season just didn't seem as strong as the others. One point is that they seem to have made dan (the boss guy) completely stupid and weak. The previous seasons he may not have been the brightest but he was strong minded. why did they have to stray from what was working?

020161622X|5.0|This book should be required reading for all developers.  It is a mix of great ideas and common sense.  It is a rare day when I find myself successfully rationalizing action that runs contrary to these pages.
0439023521|5.0|It has been a long time since I have connected with a heroine the way I related to Katniss. Her struggles in both the battle dome and with her emotions makes her all the more real. The book has a Battle Royale fight to the death plot despite trying to make connections between the two in the beginning I quickly stopped when I realized this book was an entirely different beast.<br /><br />If you are thinking about reading I highly encourage you to do so! It is well worth your time.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|The humor is definitely there, my favorite part at the dinner table and they are all singing. Not too scary depending on age I guess.

I like the plot but felt that beetlejuice should have had a bit more screen time.

B00005LANG|5.0|EXODUS is an album that completely defines not only an artist/band but the generation in which it/they grew up in, the album was recorded and subsequently released.  Bob Marley and The Wailers were truly a pop, mainstream phenomena unlike any other by the time this wonderful album was released in 1977 as has been stated and documented countless times.  The world was not only fascinated by the Rastafarian beliefs but the revolutionary principals of Reggae.  The 1960's & 1970's were truly times of revolution on a worldwide scale & NO band or group of artists signified this better than The Wailers.<br /><br />Time Magazine voted this album as the most important of the 20th century and for good reason, Bob Marley and The Wailers in both of it's incarnations during the 1960's and 1970's brought forth such powerful messages and themes that would do more than redefine music, which it did, but would also become, in many ways, the voice of revolutions on just about every continent under the sun.  Reggae or \\"Island Music\\", as it was commonly referred, was more than a genre, it was a belief and lifestyle.  The Wailers did for Island Music what Chuck Berry had done for Rock & Roll some 20 years earlier, they become a polarizing and solidifying force of a genre.<br /><br />This album was unparelled in it's effect on social consciousness and it's far reaching implications both musically and socially.  No other album had the type of worldwide effect that this one did period, thus the awarding of it's number one position by Time Magazine.  The Wailers and in particular Bob Marley became one of the most beloved and respected artists in music history for being not only great songwriters and performers but true poets and revolutionaries in every since of that word.<br /><br />EXODUS is Marley's crowning achievement, now I know many will point to some of his earlier material with the original Wailers line up including the grear Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer as better music and I agree that those recordings were splendid and set the foundation for both the band as a whole and all 3 individually and would be used as a platform for their future musically expressions.  However, the greatness of this album cannot be overstated nor underestimated and I believe this line up doesn't get the full credit they deserve for the material they produced.  Bob was the leader, songwriter and visionary but it takes a talented group of individuals to relay his message to the masses with the grace that they were able to pull off.<br /><br />This album shows Marley's incredible versatility as a songwriter, you have it all on full display, revolution, mystical themes based upon Rastafarian beliefs, songs of love and passion, songs of hope and happiness.  I believe this album is best listened to all the way through as it has a natural flow that truly comes through with a full listen.  The epic title track is one of the most incredible display's of musicianship ever recorded and was an out of this world experience live.<br /><br />The influence of this album, artist and band on a worldwide scale has been achieved by very few artists in the history of music and this is the greatest example of what made Bob Marley an artist for all seasons, times and ages.  This is must listening for anyone who truly wants to grasp how music can change perceptions and beliefs on a worldwide scale.  Time Magazine got it right on this album and when you consider all of the other monumental albums to be released in the 20th century, it shows just how much Bob Marley, The Wailers and their music meant to listeners as a whole.at those recordings were splendid and set the foundation for both the band as a whole and all 3 individually and would be used as a platform for their future musically expressions.

0439023513|5.0|Every once in a while you read a book that leaves you feeling like a better person for having read the book. I feel that way about Mockingjay.<br /><br />In the third and final book of The Hunger Games Trilogy the story centers around what happens after the Collapse of District 12 and the war that has begun in the Districts of Panem. Katniss has been rescued from the Second Hunger Games arena but Peeta was not as lucky and instead was captured by the capitol.<br /><br />Mockingjay follows the story of Katniss coming to terms with the new role of Mockinjay that has been thrust upon her, the challenges of living in a war torn world, and trying to understand her conflicting feelings for both Peeta and Gale.<br /><br />If you loved the first two Hunger Games books this is the grand Finale you've been waiting for. While I will say that I loved the story I must admit the ending was very dark and that bothered me. In Katniss's world that has been full of so much sorrow and loss I really wanted an ending I could walk away from feeling all warm and fuzzy. This ending did not offer that and even if it had it would not have been The Hunger Games series I have come to love.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I bought the DVD/Blue Ray combo pack.  I haven't tried out the DVD version, but the blue ray version plays great, and played DTS on my surround sound system.  First video I played so far, that showed DTS instead of digital on the surround system display.    The sound effects are awesome.  Could hear the animals on different speakers to allow you to feel as if you was actually in the forest.    And the movie itself, was also good.  Science fiction isn't for everyone, so if you don't like to use some imagination and if you feel there couldn't be any other life out there other then our own, then you most likely won't enjoy this movie.  But if you are open minded about other life out there, I would highly recommend this adventure.    The ending I thought really turned out well.  I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone, but I would have been very disappointed, if it turned out the other way.

B00275EGWY|1.0|EDITED TO ABIDE BY AMAZON STANDARDS CONCERNING LANGUAGE AND INSULTS<br /><br />Many years ago, practically in another life, I learned how to deactivate infernal devices.  Back in the 1980s EOD training focused primarily on unexploded ordinance rather than IEDs, and the stuff the IRA and PLO was putting together back then was downright primitive in comparison to some of the newfangled stuff our guys are facing now.  To put this in perspective, when I was at AIT cellphones hadn't even been invented yet.<br /><br />Even back in primitive times, one of the most basic and fundamental rules you learn is to consider the MANY possible anti-handling devices you might encounter.  Often, even a simple mil-spec device such as a landmine could have several anti-handling devices in place, and with an IED it could get downright devious.  I'm not going to go into any detail here, but anti-handling devices are designed to kill anyone who discovers the device and attempts to render it safe.  Any entry-level Combat Engineer knows you're not supposed to lift, roll, jostle, or shake a suspect device without a complete and detailed inspection.  The genius in this film is dragging 50 pound shells out of the dirt by their wires and prying open the trunk of a car to expose the bomb inside.  In real life, bad guys use tamper resistant bombs.  Pull it out of the dirt?  BOOM.  Open a boobytrapped trunk, hood, or door?  BOOM.  Snip random wires?  Holy collapsing circuit!  BOOM.  These were the first things you learned 25 years ago!  Today, EOD school is three times as long and you are practically qualified for an electrical engineering degree when you are done.  This idiot would have washed out halfway through the first phase.  Risktaking is one thing, foolhardy bravado is another, but what this guy was doing guaranteed him a Darwin Award.  It is glaringly obvious that no-one with any actual EOD experience was used as a consultant for this film.<br /><br />Wanton stupidity abounds, and to make things worse it isn't even an entertaining movie.  Unlikeable undeveloped characters, idiotic subplots that go nowhere, and no sense of reality.  Oh, I loved the scene when they are working the Barnett 50 which is a precision sniper rifle and they're sighting it in like an artillery piece, cleaning blood off the rounds to prevent it from jamming, and completely forget that there is an entire belt of ammo in the turret gun . . . but I digress.  Apparently, no-one who actually fired a gun was used to consult on this film either.  Ending sucked too.  Altogether, this was a dismal failure as a war movie.  Of course, the soulless drones in Hollywood and the Press Corps all think it is movie of the year deserving of numerous high awards.  This movie made me want to vomit.

B004NSULHM|1.0|This really is hard to enjoy. Even though Kid A and Amnesiac took time to \\"soak in\\", this one just doesn't have any of those nuggets. The bonus tunes you get emailed from the band afterward are more like what I was expecting. The only saving grace is that this album doesn't sound too bad if you listen to it in your car. Try it and you'll see a big difference.
0060278234|5.0|Lirael is the second book in Garth Nix's Old Kingdom series. The first book, Sabriel, can be both a stand-alone or a lead-in to this and the following books. Lirael is a girl who feels alienated among her rather large extended family with whom she lives. She doesn't look like any of them, she doesn't seem to have the skills that are expected of them, and her mother went to an extreme not previously heard of for Lirael's conception. Lirael has no idea who her father is and she is so unhappy that she even briefly considers killing herself. Before this has an opportunity to occur, she unexpectedly finds herself on a new and unexpected path-- a path that none of the extended family that she lives with can lay claim to. As each new piece of the story is revealed, it begins to look like Lirael may be the most important of all her kin to the future of their world when an ancient evil that was present in the beginning-- that has since been all but forgotten-- is released.    The Old Kingdom series is composed of two different worlds: On one side is a world similar to our own, a place where magic is usually considered only jokes, illusions, or hallucinations and technology is dominant, at least in the areas far enough away from the wall that seperates the two worlds (or two \\"countries\\" may be more appropriate but they are so different that I choose to use the word \\"worlds\\" instead). On the other side of the wall is a world where magic is a fact of life(and modern technology is not). There are a very small number of people that are part of a tradition steeped in both extraordinary ability and responsibility to make things safer for everyone not aligned with death and destruction in this world, such as the necromancers and their minions and/or masters that have become more present since the royal family died and order was lost.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I have this app and was very satisfied until I discovered that when I created a playlist on my music player, that I had duplicated some of the songs, so I proceeded to delete the songs that were duuplicated in that particular playlist and unknowingly deleted the song from my phone completely.  I checked my memory card and every place on my phone that I thought I may retrieve it from to no avail.  I was very upset to say the least. I spent over $15.00 on those downloads and now I have them no longer and can not retrieve them from the amazon.com web page as there was not save to your computer option when ordering by my phone thru the amazon.com mp3 app.  I implore Amazon to correct this issue and at least have a notification worked into the program that will put up a note asking if you are sure that you want to delete this song, as it will no longer be available.  This is the only fair thing to do, anything else, leaves the customer to have to re-purchase the song download.  I look forward to Amazon making this change very soon and until then I will be making my purchases else where.
0307279189|5.0|I was apprehensive to start reading this book which was suggested to me by multiple friends. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. It will make you want to lace up and not stop moving until your problems are solved. Going into this book I was not aware of the extreme distance running which takes place and I was immediately fascinated. Knowing what the human body is able to accomplish when pushed is not something to be taken lightly and is well examined in the pages of this engrossing nonfiction. I am a lover of knowledge and find many things interesting. \\"Born to Run\\" made running come to life for me and I will recommend it to many of my friends.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|\\"Sigh No More,\\" performed by Mumford & Sons and produced by Glassnote, combines a new listening experience using an old flavor, creating truly unique sound. One will hear a variety of instruments, such as a banjo or mandolin, among those more commonly used in pop music with appropriate lead vocals and balanced harmonies. \\"Sigh No More\\" is a whirlwind of emotions, both musically and lyrically, combined with astounding talents that is seamlessly bound together in the studio with a natural - not overly produced - impression.<br /><br />  I had seen the album cover peppered throughout webpages, so I thought I'd sample the music on Amazon. The small samples left me with an incorrect impression. I wasn't interested, at first; my tastes don't lie within Country music and I have to be in a particular mood for Bluegrass. It wasn't until I heard a catchy song playing on online radio that I became intrigued. After looking to see who was playing, I swallowed my pride and purchased a MP3 version of the release. ...I was never more glad to be wrong! Listening still becomes an adventure with the blend of folk instruments skillfully weaving back and forth between nostalgic and contemporary techniques of playing.<br /><br />  The accompanying lyrics are thoughtful and poetic, easily relatable while using conversational tones and adapting to common modern situations. It becomes like receiving thoughtful life-advice from a old friend. Almost every song seems to have at least one philosophical line of wisdom, but there are songs like \\"Little Lion Man\\" where the lesson lies in the overall theme of the song.<br /><br />  The engineering is perfection. In the eerily beautiful \\"Thistle & Weeds,\\" the music builds and swells perfectly with a strong bottom end that underscores the meaning of the lyrics. In \\"Timshel,\\" the vocals are exceptionally balanced and placed within the sound field so that each voice is crystal clear while blending fluidly with each other.<br /><br />  This has become one of my favorite releases; I'm only sorry to have waited so long to give it a real chance.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is the television series that spawned the movie \\"Serenity\\". Both are considered sci-fi cult classics, and for good reason. The characters are engaging (the casting is, in my opinion, exceptional) and the action and plot are equally good. If you have not seen either of these works, I would recommend them very highly. The world that this show takes place in is both futuristic and not at the same time. The story takes place in space, primarily on a space ship in fact. Even so, there is more of a \\"western\\" feeling to everything than \\"space-alien\\". There are also Asian overtones to everything in the more populated areas. Somehow, this Space Opera-Western-Asian-style amalgamation is both endearing and strongly entertaining.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I'm a fan of the show, but I didn't buy the individual boxes of each season because I was expecting a collector edition of the complete series.    I checked on the web and I saw this wonderful product coming out in the U.S. I just had to wait for it to come out in my country, so I waited, and I learnt that a so called collector box would come out, but not the same as the American one. Let me tell you what it's like : the original individual boxes of each season (meaning all in a different color) gathered and put into some as-thin-as-paper crappy cardboard, and that's about it! How ridiculous! Moreover, it costs 220 dollars!    I didn't hesitated long and just bought the collector on amazon.com, and I don't regret it! What an outstanding quality, the texture of the box, the pictures, the items, the DVD and their contents, everything's just perfect! And it's so much cheaper than the french one!    I wasn't sure about the languages available on the DVD, but you can watch it in English and also in French, with or without the subtitles, all you need is a zone 1 or multi zone DVD player.    The only drawback is that it took ages to reach me, I don't know why exactly because Amazon sent it like the day after my order... But it was definitely worth waiting!  I'm so glad I finally received it and I have one of my favorite shows eternalized in such a wonderful box!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I have enjoyed Les Miserables from the very beginning and I can honestly say that of all the versions I've heard over the years, these cast members were the very best - except Nick Jonas. He did an okay job, but it was clear he was lacking beside the others. However, in his defense, he still did a great job. I don't know many of us armchair critics who could get up and do what he did!    I always found the voices of the London and Broadway casts to be harsh & not particularly easy on my ears, especially those playing Jean Valjean, Javert & Cozette. And Marius and Cozette always sounded older than the characters should be, which was a real turn-off.    I was so pleasantly surprised by how smooth and easy on they ears the voices of Alfie Boe (Jean Valjean) & Norm Lewis (Javert) were. I can't get enough of them! Lea Solonga (Fantine) & Samantha Barks (Eponine) seemed, in my humble opinion, to be perfect in their roles as well. I like these performers because rather than try to sound operatic and loud, they seemed to almost be living their roles. It gave me chills to watch and hear them and I couldn't wait to purchase the DVD - which for me is unheard of!
B002GIBVV6|2.0|The acting, and the costumes in this movie were great. The Manor was too dark and dirty, the garden looks like \\"a gardener's garden\\" in the book, Mary said she didn't want it to look like that. There are too many differences between book and film, for me to give it more than two stars. I don't see WHY this movie was made such a BIG fuss over. It was mainly a grand, meaning expensive, production.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I love this film. It is simply the best creative animation, multi layered message film since my first love, the Yellow Submarine.    I wish I could give it to everyone I love.

B004JK61K0|4.0|This just rocks for encryption integration.  Nothing comes close.  Works great with POP and IMAP.  Several of us have tried to make this work on Exchange servers (different ones) with no real success.  We can get a connect here or there, but it is just not Touchdown.  Without solid and hassle-free Exchange support, I can't give this a 5, but APG support for encryption like this should be in every top-tier package.
B002PMV9K6|4.0|I received the movie in a flimsy DVD case, the cover looked like a poor copy and the DVD itself looked like a bootleg version.  But all appearances aside, the quality of the video was great.  The full screen was actually projected as a smaller box on my tv, but it may have something to do with a setting on my tv.  If you are a collector, I would not recommend this as a collector's copy.  But if you just want the DVD to watch, then the DVD value is great.
0307454541|1.0|This book was seriously dull. I would say I skimmed more that a third of the book, maybe even as much as half, never a good sign. I found myself well over 200 pages in and about to give up but was determined to finish. I simply couldn't return it to my friend and say I didn't finish, plus I hate to start a book and not make it to the end no matter how bad the book(although I have done it).<br /><br />Our two protagonists in this story are Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander, the latter is a much more interesting character than the former. Blomkvist must simply be a god. Everyone wants to sleep with him, he must be the finest male specimen in all of Sweden. I was once told by a friend who is married to a Swedish man that the Swedish view sex like a handshake, monogamy is not really something you see a lot there. Mikael Blomkvist shakes hands with a lot of women then. I believe another reviewer called him a mimbo, I couldn't come up with a more apt description. Also, I lost count of how many times this man ate sandwiches. Does the reader really need to know the life of our protagonist in such minute detail? I get it, he likes sandwiches, he sweats when he runs...et cetera, et cetera ad nauseam. Overall, not a fascinating character. Lisbeth Salander is the girl with the dragon tattoo. She is an excellent investigator with amazing computer skills, apparently. It turns out she may have Asperger's Syndrome which may explain her photographic memory and social ineptitude. Plus, she really likes Apple computers (there are a lot of product placements in this novel, a lot). I found her an intriguing figure albeit a little annoying at times. I was especially frustrated with this character when she bullied everyone into hiding everything having to do with the serial killer and his deeds so that she can avoid having to deal with the police. What about the poor families of all his victims? They deserve to know what has happened to their loved ones. There is definitely a lot of mystery surrounding Salander's life and circumstances, finding out more about her almost makes me want to read the second book. Perhaps I'll pick it up the next time I have a bout with insomnia.<br /><br />I won't give a synopsis of the story as so many have already done, I'll just go directly to my complaints. There were too many plots! The whole plot line with Blomkvist and Wennerstrom could have been completely edited out. It added nothing to the story and sections having to do with this were when my eyes would glaze over, thus the skimming. What I remember from these portions was a lot of boring financial talk. Blah, blah, blah. In addition to this unnecessary plot we have the gratuitous torture and rape of one of the main characters. Having read some other reviews I realize that this is important to the second book, I say then perhaps include it in flashback form in that book. It simply seemed out of place in this one, especially when you get to the end and realize it is never really dealt with again and had no bearing on what seemed to be the meat of the story.<br /><br />The mystery of the disappearance of Harriet Vanger was the part of the story that was, to me, the most interesting and held the most promise. Yet even in this the investigation got bogged down with a lot of boring back story and history that could have been cut down considerably. Things didn't really start to develop in the investigation until almost 300 pages in and then it seemed to climax a little too quickly. There were still well over one hundred pages left to the book! Also, I had already figured out who the murderer was so there was no real shock there.**SPOILERS** By the way, I wanted to throw the book across the room when he intentionally drove straight into a truck and died, the most unsatisfying ending to a villain in quite some time. **END SPOILERS** He should have had to rot in the dankest, darkest cell in the most unsanitary and dangerous prison ever known to man. Also, a warningthat there are some very descriptive and disturbing passages dealing with the torture, rape and murder of the serial killers murder victims. Back to that last 100+ pages, we find out what happened to Harriet which really didn't take up more than one chapter but was satisfying none the less. What else, you might ask, did the rest of the book contain? Back to the mundane financial storyline, I did not read it at all. Ugh.<br /><br />Overall, this book was a dud for me. I think perhaps a better title would have been \\"The Man Who Eats Lots of Sandwiches.\\" Has a nice ring to it, don't ya think? :)y descriptive and disturbing passages dealing with the torture, rape and murder of the serial killers murder victims.

B004UID2LC|5.0|Used this app with my Asus Transformer tablet and it worked like a charm. For those who are having problems, maybe after downloading you need to restart your device as well.

B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|This is the first time I've actually bought a TV series. Usually I don't bother shelling out the cash since I'd only watch it once, maybe a few exceptional episodes twice at most. But I had to buy this because, (a) a close friend kept raving about how well they adapted the graphic novel and (b) It's the Walking Dead. I wanted to watch it in pristine Blu-Ray quality, not some dinky grainy download version.<br /><br />So, there. I bought it and you can obviously see, from the title, that I loved it haha. It's not exactly the same as the graphic novel but it comes pretty damn close. And the changes, in my own opinion, are for the better. I watched the special features and Kirkman (the creator of the comic) had a large hand in the production of this TV series, and it really shows.<br /><br />For the die hard fans out there bemoaning the changes, I don't think change is always a bad thing. Put in perspective, it's a rare occasion that an artists gets a chance to revisit a work after its become a sensation and revise it. I don't think the changes have detracted from the quality one bit.<br /><br />The only thing is, I wished it was a bit longer. I knew when I bought it that it would only be six episodes but still, I was left wanting more at the end.<br /><br />Bottom line: EXCELLENT PRODUCT
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I am a H5-0 fan way back from the original. I'm one of those who've waited all these years for a modern version and now it's here! They're still finding their sea legs, but the show keeps getting better and better with each new episode. I'm a regular watcher, I pre-ordered the new show on DVD -- I just hope it comes out in Blu-ray! Good to see they're giving cameo roles to some of the original actors -- Al Harrington for instance. And the new characters are a trip, like the big guy who sells shave ice. And you can't find more gorgeous shots of Hawaii anywhere on TV. They are reaching for what counts: good story, good acting, good direction. My only beef -- and it's a BIG one -- is the music.  They cut the theme song in half! In fact, more than half! And the scenes have what I call \\"generic moron music\\" droning away in the background instead of background music written -- as it was in the 70s-- for mainly winds, brass and percussion based on the theme song.  Just to stuff another commercial in there? Come on!!! Oh yeah, and General Motors is having its revenge over Ford -- used to be in the original that all the good guys rode around in Ford cars and the GMs were driven by the baddies. Now that's all reversed!  😜<br /><br />UPDATE 8/31/14: One thing is tremendously disappointing: these are only DVD and not Blu-Ray. While the color is fine, the clarity is awful. Until they release episodes in Blu-Ray, I'll not be buying any more. 😡
B000HT3P7E|4.0|If I was reviewing only the show itself, I'd give it a solid 5 stars.  The characters are fun and likeable, and the dialog is quick and smart.  It's one of the best shows on television, and the first season is the best of the series.  However, the DVD seems to be put together in a very amateur way.  To start, while the show was originally aired in 16:9 aspect ratio, the DVD crops off the sides to create a 4:3 aspect ratio known as \\"fullscreen\\" (or \\"foolscreen\\") before everyone had 16:9 widescreen TVs.  In addition, much of the music from the original show has been replaced with different songs on the DVDs.  The original broadcast music fit perfectly with the show, but when watching the DVD, it feels like something is missing.<br /><br />Despite the drawbacks of the DVD, I'd still recommend Season 1 of How I Met Your Mother because the show itself more than makes up for the DVD's shortcomings.

116932701X|4.0|***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />D. H. Lawrence published Lady Chatterley's Lover in 1928, two years before he died, however the novel wouldn't appear in its unexpurgated form until 1960. The story centres on Lady Constance Chatterley and her affairs with two men. Although the title focusses on the singular lover, Lady Chatterley does engage in two extramarital affairs. Lady Chatterley is married to Sir Clifford, who was paralyzed in World War I and left impotent. The Chatterleys are childless and Sir Clifford gives his wife approval to have a whirlwind affair for the sole purpose of getting herself pregnant to produce an heir to his estate and fortune. I am sure the British censors had reasons to disapprove of the novel on this basis alone, before any sex is depicted at all. Permitting members of the aristrocracy to fool around under the full knowledge of both married parties (early twentieth-century \\"swinging\\") was taboo, regardless who was doing it. Lady Chatterley's Lover also caused so much controversy because it crossed British social classes with Lady Constance's long affair with Oliver Mellors, the estate's pheasant-tending gamekeeper.<br /><br />The language used in the novel is another issue in itself, as Lawrence writes unflinchingly with swear words and depicts various sex acts and sex play. In 1928 England, such writing was considered obscene. I myself was surprised that the foulest language of 1920's England would be so close to what is still said today. The lover in the title, Mellors, feels most at ease when he speaks in his Derby dialect, and Lawrence approximates his speech within the confines of modern typeface with plenty of apostrophes and elisions. It was not difficult to read, and easy to figure out if I read the dialect aloud. Mellors often shifts from dialect to proper and formal English, and often confounds the upper classes by being able to speak to them like a perfect gentleman. Mellors speaks like a college-age drunken sailor when engaging in sex or sex play with Lady Chatterley, and Lawrence's Harlequin Romance euphemisms seem beautiful, and not trite, in their imagery.<br /><br />Over the course of my reading of Lawrence's novels, I have noticed his tendency to write one observation then immediately afterward contradict that point or write its opposite. This is encountered throughout Lady Chatterley's Lover. While Constance sits in on a meeting her husband has with some gentleman friends:<br /><br />\\"She liked to hear what they had to say, especially when Tommy was there. It was fun. Instead of men kissing you, and touching you with their bodies, they revealed their minds to you. It was great fun! But what cold minds!<br />\\"And also it was a little irritating.\\"<br /><br />Clifford, paralyzed and in a wheelchair after the Great War and seeking to find new ways to occupy his time, aspires to fame and fortune by being a successful writer. As he embarks on his literary career:<br /><br />\\"Clifford, of course, had still many childish taboos and fetishes. He wanted to be thought 'really good,' which was all cock-a-hoopy nonsense. What was really good was what actually caught on. It was no good being really good and getting left with it. It seemed as if most of the 'really good' men just missed the bus. After all you only lived one life, and if you missed the bus, you were just left on the pavement, along with the rest of the failures.\\"<br /><br />I wonder if Lawrence projected his own literary aspirations onto Clifford. Lawrence probably felt the pull of mass popularity with mediocre work versus obscurity with well-reviewed, yet unsold, work. I found it amusing that he used William James's term for success, the \\"bitch goddess\\", throughout the novel, in Clifford's quest for fame.<br /><br />Lady Chatterley discovers that she is pregnant by Mellors, and while Sir Clifford did give his consent for her to go out and have a fling for the sole purpose of conceiving, he expressly forbade her to carry on a relationship with whatever man who fathered her child. Lady Chatterley and Mellors decide to divorce their spouses and move away, perhaps to British Columbia (I love the Canadian connection) and when Constance tells her husband of her plans, he is left stupefied, immobile, unable to talk and virtually paralyzed across his entire body when he discovers that the man his wife had been carrying on with was his own servant. The final chapters are filled with tension, drama and suspense. I could not put the book down as Lady Chatterley and Mellors devised ways to save their reputations, try to live discreetly and to counter their critics. The tangled web they wove was a rapid page-turner, and made me sad that the novel was not two hundred pages longer like Sons and Lovers or Women in Love.y Chatterley and Mellors decide to divorce their spouses and move away, perhaps to British Columbia (I love the Canadian connection) and when Constance tells her husband of her plans, he is left stupefied, immobile, unable to talk and virtually paralyzed across his entire body when he discovers that the man his wife had been carrying on with was his own servant.

B004EBUXSA|4.0|Kind of pricey for its Price v.s. Performance.    The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of 2 following reasons:  -First of all, Not all 2600k chips are the same.  There are a few chips out there that can overclock better then others. (Which is I think is very annoying.)  -Second, It is only slightly faster than the i5 2500k. Like the tomshardware.com article says; \\"The $100 spread between the Core i5-2500K and Core i7-2600K is only recommended if you want to brag, because you're probably not going to notice any appreciable frame rate difference. The Core i7's strength is only really exploited in heavily-threaded workstation applications, rather than games.\\" And even then you can get that desktop performance from the Phenom 1090t for a third less cash.

There are very few books (less than 5) that I would consider reading for a second time, but I plan to read this one again.  I wish we didn't have to wait until 2012 for the next installment!<br /><br />While I did not identify with Diana, I did get caught up in the storyline. (And can I get my own Matthew Clairmont please?). The characters are vampires, witches and daemons, but I found the story to be more literary than paranormal. It was brilliantly researched and written. Deborah Harkness has a flair for the descriptive, painting a fantastic picture for your senses.  I became an instant fan!

Hey George is redoing the 1st 3 films, and he re-releases all 3 with the added SFX which added intothe visuals etc, loved em, So we ALL buy that.    George makes the newer films, which all come out on DVD., then the 2004 box.    2011, Now this Blu Ray Box set, as many have said prior, does NOT include the extended versions, and the \\"extras\\" over 30hrs is on 3 other discs.    2012 is when the Extended Versions set will come out, and that leaves you with 2014!

B0002KZAKS|5.0|Price and performance wise, this mic is as good or better than the sm58.      I have been using 3 the of Behringer xm8500 mics in my home studio for over 5 years now.  The sound or 'flavor' of this mic is almost identical to an early 90's Shure sm58 that I also use in the studio.  The only noticeable difference between the two (sound wise) is the xm8500 has a tiny bit more output, and the presence peak is slightly lower in the frequency scale - I would describe this as the sm58 peak being slightly airy and cutting, and the xm8500 being thick and meaty.  If you are using this mic with a 3 band eq, you can bump the mids slightly and match the sound of the xm8500 to that of the sm58 with no problem.    Build wise, this mic is as beastly and tank-like as the sm58.  It has a nice heft to it, solid metal housing, all that good stuff.      This mic excels on vocals, close mic'ing drums, bass cabs, guitar cabs,...basically anywhere you would normally use an sm58, you can use this mic there and it will perform like a champ.  My favorite task for this mic is bass amps, and toms.  The presence bump on this mic makes toms sit just right in the mix w/out having to fuss with the eq too much (you get the nice low end 'thwump' and the necessary mid range 'slap' to not only hear, but FEEL the toms in the mix).    Do yourself a favor and build some xlr patch cables with resistor(s) in them to better match the low impedance signal of this dynamic mic to the high impedance inputs of today's mic preamps.  You will find that the mic will perform as it (or actually the sm58 it is modeled after) was designed to.  Google 'taming the shure' for more info.    For about $20, this mic definitely beats out the sm58 in my book.  Don't be a gear snob,...get your money's worth and try out this mic.

B00004KD11|4.0|While the MKII lineup of Deep Purple is normally considered the best, to be honest, it's actually my least favorite of the first three lineups.  Perhaps the Coverdale period is my favorite because an album like Come Taste the Band appeals to me with its funky rhythms and soulful vocal melodies, but the very first lineup offers instant satisfaction as well.      Yes, these songs sound horribly dated.  The year is 1968 so it's understandable.  Yes the majority of the album is loaded with cover songs, however this is an *extremely* rare exception where a band actually goes the extra distance to make the cover songs different, and arguably better (though whether these cover songs are actually better or not is completely up to the listener).    We all know the wonderful verse melody and chorus from \\"Hush\\" because radio stations have been doing a number on that song for years, and you know, despite being overplayed, I still love it.  In fact I always turn it up when I hear it on the radio.  The truth is, the song always reminded me of Steam's \\"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\\" and as a child I'd get the two songs confused, however nowadays I prefer the Deep Purple song because the Steam track has been murdered by overexposure whether it be audience participation in WWE events bringing the song to peoples attention, or the classic rock FM radio station format itself.    I'm also a big fan of the vocal melody in \\"One More Rainy Day\\".  The lead singer is seriously *almost* as good as Ian Gillan on this particular track.    Now some of these cover songs are a bit overlong, but on the other hand there's a reason for it- they add a lot.  The prelude to \\"Prelude: Happiness/I'm So Glad\\" is REALLY cool, and the same can be said for the intro to \\"Hey Joe\\".  The organ is a fantastic musical instrument, and the way the organ is used in these two songs gives a distinct feeling of a mysterious and dark place.      I gotta admit that the chorus repeats WAY too much during the \\"I'm So Glad\\" part, and I believe it was the same way in the original version as well.  Too bad- had it been trimmed by a couple minutes I wouldn't be complaining about it at all.  As for the vocals in \\"Hey Joe\\", well they aren't *quite* as compassionately delivered as in the famous Hendrix version, but they're hardly a disappointment either.  Perhaps the entire song is performed slightly slower than the Hendrix version.      This version of \\"Help\\" is absolutely INCREDIBLE!  It's a *drastically* slower-paced version of the Beatles song which actually makes it sound significantly more personal and emotional.  I don't know guys, I love the Beatles and everything, but this version might be more appealing to me.  Perhaps I'm just blown away by how different it sounds and I need time to figure out which version I prefer.     Other songs like \\"Mandrake Root\\" contain incredibly sad vocals before eventually turning into a pretty spectacular guitar jam, and \\"Love Help Me\\" is just a beautifully written song.      Overall the early version of Deep Purple isn't nearly as forgettable as some might believe.  I highly recommend this and the Book of Taliesyn albums as a part of your rock library.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|A good read. Entertaining in the way historical events are woven into the story. I checked many of the historical events and they are indeed factual. I liked the suspense and the love story that takes place between the main characters. It is just a fun read. I can't wait for the next installment.
B004EBT5CU|2.0|This is a nice little album, but there is nothing extraordinary about it.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|I first saw the Sound of Music when I was in the first grade. I remember liking the songs  (Do-Re-Mi was always a favorite) but not understanding the story at all. The six -year old me never did quite get the whole Nazi part of the film. It wasn't until years later I understood what the red flag with the weird spider, as Gretl (or was it Brigita?) calls it, really meant, and it was then I fully comprehended the heaviness of the third act of the film.<br /><br />As I was going through a musical dvd shopping spree I decided to revisit the Von Trapp family. Realizing that the time I saw it in 1st grade was the ONLY time I had actually seen the film. 20 years later I sat down to watch Julie Andrews sing about the hills being alive and a few of her favorite things, and I was riveted from start to finish. I half expected to stop the dvd or skip a few chapters, but instead I was enthralled in the story line which I could now, as an adult, both understand and appreciate.<br /><br />While the threat of the Nazi regime's take over of Austria is woven throughout the story, it does not take center stage. What is at the heart of this film is the power of music and how it can save a life and awaken the soul.<br /><br />Up until Maria's arrival at the Von Trapp household (or should I say mansion, the place is huge!) Captain Von Trapp treats his children like little soldiers--they march and stand at attention at his command, and respond to his whistle like dogs.  Maria's entrance into the household brings tenderness and the showing of love back into the home.  What follows is an endless parade of musical magic, songs that stay stuck in your brain and moments that make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.<br /><br />As a viewer you bare witness to the evolvement of a man and his family who are captivated by sweet Maria, and the flourishing of a love between a man and a woman. It was a story that was so good I didn't want it to end. As the filmed closed, and the camera pans back to reveal the family making their way through the mountains, I found myself truly sorry to say \\"so long, farewell, auf Weiderseshen, good night.\\"<br /><br />The film is truly lovely, and the Blu-ray presentation is spectacular.

B003TML0VO|3.0|There's a pony in here so keep digging. Yes, many of the songs are excruciatingly bad, generally the \\"arena rock\\" or \\"hard rock\\" numbers.  But some are pretty good, specifically: Guitar Gently Weeps, Little Wing, Sunshine of Your Love, and I Ain't Superstitious.  But every cut, even if it is not an organically artistic  whole, has some moments of impressive guitar playing, often some 32nd note shredding that blows my mind from a guy who is nearing 70. Certainly a lot more flashy than say, Eric Clapton these days. It's kind of kitschy, yes, and not very Latin at all.  But still pretty impressive. If we had heard some of these 35 years ago, they'd be legendary. Rock on.
0307593495|5.0|This book is excellent!  For those of you who are Kurt Wallander fans, this is a \\"must read\\". If you've followed the character, as I have, from the first installment to the eighth, you'll read this one with both fondness and sadness.  It's one of his most complex murder mysteries and, for me, the most poignant.     It made me go back and buy Mankell's other book \\"The Pyramid: The First Wallander Cases\\".      Buy both!  You'll love them.
031261246X|5.0|If you like Michael Crichton and Dan Brown novels, you will like Zero Day.  It reminded me a lot of Crichton's book, PREY, where I was learning about nanotechnology coupled with the pace of Brown's DaVinci Code.  I don't consider myself a technical person, but I enjoy learning about technology, particularly in novels that read like Jurassic Park where things start going wrong all over.  I was hooked from the beginning with each computer crash.  I had known about Russinovich's reputation as a Microsoft technical writer and was extremely impressed that he was able to successfully cross over to the world of fiction.  I just bought an extra copy for a friend of mine who just got his online banking account hacked and would have lost $25,000 if he wasn't paying attention.  Enjoy the book and update your anti-virus software.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|I am one of those who saw Star Wars when it was on the Big screen in 77. Loved it. Loved it to death. Was registered with Lucas Films and got subscribed to the magazine Bantha Tracks that would come out every couple of months (this was before the internet). I had the bed sheets, the toys etc. I was a real Star Wars nerd and still continue to love them through repeat viewing.<br /><br />I can't say the same positive thing for the sequels. The prequels were not only a bad idea but they were poorly written by Lucas and it shows on screen; none of the magic of the first three. Just lots of noisy special effects with no heart. The characters were over dramatic and bland. Anakin is a Brat. I really wanted to like the prequels but you can definitely tell that he did not get the help writing this trilogy as he did the other.<br /><br />So would I buy the original trilogy again (I have the VHS and DVD versions)? Not a chance and this isn't because of the prequels but because I want to see the original trilogy the way I saw it in the theater. No weird creatures that look fake in Mos Isley. No Gredo shooting first and then changed again to both shooting at the same time. I want Han the way he was originally conceived. Of course Lucas won't remaster that with all the money he makes from fans, just the lousy re-dos.<br /><br />I don't know of anyone that grew up in the 70's and 80's that like the prequels so maybe it is just for people that like the effects and lousy character development and a lot of fast cuts. People who like the prequels because they are part of the first three movies. I can't explain why anyone would call the Prequels entertaining. Messy film making with no soul. That is what Lucas has proved with the prequels and the last Indiana Jones movie.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|George Lucas RUINED the saga with all of his \\"enhancements.\\" The fans want the original theatrical editions!

B003UYV08E|3.0|I watched Iron Man 1 two nights ago and Iron Man 2 last night with my two teenage boys. I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 but didn't find Iron Man 2 as good. I did like the special effects though and found Robert Downey Jr. even better.<br /><br />In Iron Man 1, Downey plays Tony Stark, the owner of a company which builds weapons. He gets captured in Iraq and a magnet is installed in his chest to prevent him from dying. He uses this magnet in an invention, an \\"Iron Man suit\\", to excape from his captors who are forcing him to build a weapon for them. When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm. He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool. Jeff Bridges is the villain, Gwyneth Paltrow is ok but kind of boring as his assistant, and Terrence Howard, who I really like, plays his part well as the military friend of Iron Man. I really enjoyed Iron Man 1 because of the great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff. And really really cool cars.<br /><br />In Iron Man 2, Stark has now disclosed to the public that he is Iron Man and the fame has gone a bit to his head. The government wants his 'weapon', his board loses confidence in him, his friends become increasingly annoyed with his behaviour, and the magnet in his chest is poisoning him to death. Paltrow is back as his assistant, Pepper, but I don't like her character as much in this one; too harsh. and Downey of course is back as Tony Stark. But in this movie, Don Cheadle has replaced Terrence Howard as his military friend. I like Cheadle but much preferred Howard. Samuel Jackson is great as usual as is Mickey Rourke who plays the villain, but Scarlett Johanssen's character was boring and very unrealistic (yes, even for a super-hero movie).<br /><br />I did enjoy the background about Stark's family and father, especially when he discovers a message left to him by his father which can save his life. And Robert Downey's character is even more enjoyable in this one ie wittier, more sarcastic, more foibles.<br /><br />So, my conclusion is that it is still worth watching though not as good as the first. A good family movie though and funny.ittier, more sarcastic, more foibles.  So, my conclusion is that it is still worth watching though not as good as the first. A good family movie though and funny.
B004L49K20|3.0|A pretty good DD album. It's too over-produced for my taste, but there's still some good upbeat songs, such as All You Need Is Now, Runway Runaway, and Girl Panic. The ballads are hit-or-miss, and Simon whines his way through too many mid-tempo songs. Some folks like that, not me. To each his own. It's definitely better than most of RCM, about on par with Astronaut. Certainly nowhere near as good as Rio, Seven, Notorious, etc. I give them credit for still putting out good albums, but wish they'd trust themselves more and ditch the hotshot producers that end up making albums that sound more like the producer than like Duran Duran.
B002ZG99IG|3.0|Well, I will start with the good and then cover the bad.<br /><br />The plot is good. The film starts with Sara Matthews (Minka Kelly)  arriving at her new university, going to her new room and awaiting the arrival of her new roommate. Sara makes friends quickly with a few party girls and gets invited to a frat party where she catches the eye of Stephen (Cam Gigandet), a frat boy and drummer in a band. When she returns to her room, her roommate Rebecca (Leighton Meester) has arrived. Rebecca appears to be a social misfit and does not seem to want to become friends with anyone other than Sara, who she quickly becomes possessive of and obsessed about. Gradually she begins to harm anyone else in Sara's life who appears to be either getting in the way of Rebecca's friendship with her or upsetting Sara. These include Stephen, who has very quickly become Sara's boyfriend, Sara's party-girl friend Tracy (Alyson Michalka), her gay and somewhat promiscuous fashion mentor, Irene (Danneel Harris), and her lecherous design professor (Billy Zane). Oh, and Cuddles the kitten.<br /><br />Sara starts to become suspicious of Rebecca's behaviour after she meets Rebecca's parents who are concerned about and frightened by Rebecca. More people get hurt and eventually, Sara and Rebecca confront.<br /><br />So the plot is good. The suspense is also good. Yes the film is predictable but it is not too gory, certainly not the least bit difficult to understand, and makes sense for the most part. The acting of the two lead characters, Sara and Rebecca, is also quite good and believable.<br /><br />The bad: the film seems to rush along faster than it makes sense. A little bit more lead in to the roommate's obsession with Sara would be more believable. The other characters are boring and stereotyped; the boyfriend spends most of his time squinting and trying to look cool, the friends Irene and Tracy seem to have nothing to their characters. I liked Billy Zane and would have liked to see a bigger part for him. Even the part where Tracy seduces him to damage his reputation is not believable because the film rushes through that. The portrayal of college life was also completely stereotypical.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer's statements: If you're looking to kill some time with a fun movie..this is for you! If you are looking for something with substance, depth, originality, plot, and a storyline that keeps you enthralled to the bitter end...keep it moving this isn't your cup of tea!<br /><br />I was just looking to kill time with an ok movie so it achieved that purpose. But I wouldn't watch it again.seduces him to damage his reputation is not believable because the film rushes through that. The portrayal of college life was also completely stereotypical.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|While I'm happy that I have my (terrible transfer) \\"bonus disc\\" versions of the original trilogy on DVD, I don't understand why the studio that released such excellent box sets for the Alien saga on Blu (which included both Theatrical and Altered versions of all four films) can not do a similar release for the Star Wars Trilogy.    Many mention the terrible changes to Star Wars.  To be a little different, I'll talk about Empire.  Changing a line (spoken to a robot) from \\"You're lucky you don't taste very good\\" to \\"You're lucky to be alive.\\" Adding that goofy scream when Luke plummets to his fate (which I heard they then took out, and put back in softened, and who knows what will be on this release?).  The terrible re-edit with flash cuts and CG imperial shuttle in the last 10 minutes of the movie.  Taking the time to CG up all the effects, but still not getting rid of the blue screen artifact \\"boxes\\" around the asteroids and tie fighters (I mean, if you're going to \\"fix\\" it, then go ahead and fix it).  Not that I mind the boxes.  They were a product of when the movie was made, and I like that.  I like time capsules on film, which is exactly why I don't like the \\"special\\" editions.    So, yeah.  Fox/Lucas won't be getting my money until the original theatrical versions of the trilogy gets a proper release on Blu.  If it's not better than the blurry sub-standard ones they already put out on DVD, I'll still be saving my money.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I, like most everyone else on here, simply want the original trilogy in high def.  I don't understand why George Lucas is so damned stubborn.  He HAS to know by this point how many people want to see his classic, original trilogy in pristine, widescreen editions (the paltry, un-anamorphic, unrestored DVD extras included on the last set just didn't cut it).      I just don't understand the man's logic.  If he were to include both versions in this set then he would sell MANY more copies and everyone would be happy.  It's basically as if he want's to rid the world forever of his original works and that's truly sad.  I realize that these new versions contain his supposed original \\"vision\\"... but they are not the versions that so many millions of his fans grew to love and cherish all of their lives.  That ought to count for SOMETHING in his mind.    I also understand that the films are his creations and he has the right to tamper with them as he sees fit, but they were never self indulgent films to begin with, as he has made them now.  It strikes me as very unfair to give something as monumental as the Star Wars films to the public, only to yank them away, change them into entirely different entities, and then toss them back in what he obviously considers superior, but what many fans feel are quite inferior editions.        I am not expecting anything to change from any of these Amazon reviews.  10 million negative reviews probably wouldn't change the man's mind.  He doesn't need more money.  He already has more cash than God.  Fans of the originals can only hope that he will eventually, one day see the light.  Either that or when he finally dies, maybe his estate will do the right thing...  In my opinion, to have such important films as the Star Wars Trilogy only readily available in these silly new editions is a truly a travesty.
B000F9RB9Y|2.0|The movies the same but the Blue Ray is not needed. It was not shot at this high a quality. The regular DVD would be fine.   After seeing this again, I much preferred Bourne Identity. I just didn't remember T1 robot being clay-mation...
B002M9WW30|5.0|Rocky: The Undisputed Collection on Blu-Ray is a must for any Rocky fans. They did great cleaning up the old films and the sound is even more crisp then I remember from my childhood back in the 70's. If you enjoyed the Rocky movies bad enough to want to own the complete set than look no further than this box set. Okay we could probably all do without the Rocky 5 movie which I felt was the one sadly pathetic movie in the series. I do like 1-4 and 6 a.k.a. Rocky Balboa was kind of a cool modern twist even though in reality I think the old Italian Stallion would've been turned into Italian Sausage fighting such a younger current champ. Had they messed up anything of my memories of the Rocky movies I'd say so but they didn't and I'm very happy I never previously purchased any Rocky movies until now. This is truly the best box set I think you can buy for Rocky fans.

The South he wrote and sang about is mostly gone, for better and for worse, but you can still get a feeling for it through this music.  Few records I own can produce a more emotional response than Avalon Blues.  Mr Hurt's voice, the scratchy recording, the haunting guitar, it's all here.  Sure, you'll need to pick up the recordings from the sixties, too, but this is the real deal.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|(To Andy Orrock: I've borrowed your review title; I hope you don't mind. It's just so appropriate! It distills the very essence of the film.)    Long ago, when I was a teenager, I had a pen pal in West Germany. She and her family were refugees from East Germany who had risked their lives to escape across the border. At the time, while I had a generalized opposition to Communism, I didn't really comprehend what would motivate someone to do that. Chalk it up to my immaturity I guess.    Having watched this superb film, it now is crystal clear to me.    To Sigrid Kunze (if by some miraculous coincidence you happen to read this), I apologize for being so dense at the time.    A great movie that should be seen by all who love liberty.    P.S. This is currently #53 in the IMDB \\"Top 250\\" films. It won both an Oscar and BAFTA as Best Foreign Language Film of the Year.
B004RC8NXI|5.0|I prefer romcoms to be rated R for so many reasons, most of all because of what this film allowed in everyone being able to cuss and talk about relationships honestly - and for ladies to free themselves on screen in a variety of ways (even the supplements would be rated R).<br /><br />The story follows two unlikely acquaintances from their first awkward adolescent \\"experience\\" to their adult escapades of trying to keep things purely physical and not emotional. The usual issues arise but the friend networks on each side keep things fun, along with Kline adding some great comedy as the mid/late life crisis dad going through his own serious love issues. No big surprises here, but this is about watching pretty people doing adult things in this modern era. The supplements are interesting and include:<br /><br />* Deleted scenes, 5 @ 11:04 minutes. The two obvious sequences where things had been removed early in the film are shown here (Reitman awkwardly edited the Jewish references out of the funeral scene). Glad they cut out more of the dancing high school numbers.<br />* Alternate storyline, 2 @ 3:45 minutes. Wish this would have been left in the film as it shows Ashton's and Lake Bell's characters having a decent relationship, worth the watch.<br />* Dos & Donts of Modern Love, 8:46 minutes. A clip-heavy take on all of the actors/creators giving their take on how modern relationships work like depicted in the film.<br />* Sassy halls of Secret High, 11:22 minutes. What actually makes this Glee-ish mess watchable is Kevin Kline - again. All of the extras are worth the time just to see him talk about what he does - hilarious. If you are into the dance routines and musical references this would be your supplement.<br />* Sex friends, the making of, 20:46 minutes. Lengthy talking head piece with plenty of clips and honest input about the film - including the original title; F**kbuddies. Virtually everyone gets interviewed here; if you are a fan of Meriwether's writing this is your one to watch.<br />* Commentary by Reitman. I got more out of what I needed for this film on the other extras.<br />* Disc 2 is a bare-bones version of the DVD with a Dig Copy included.<br /><br />English 5.1 DTS (which was great), French, Spanish, Portuguese 5.1 & English Descriptive Service with subs in same.

When the shipment notice came on the second CD I emailed again and was told it was to late to cancel, even though I explained I had emailed three times already to cancel.  This isn't the first time MOVIE MARS has done this to me, and I will never order anything from them again, it's a scam, and it's intentional.  Now I have two of these, but the CD is fantastic as is DURAN DURAN.  This is one of thier best ever.
B004SBX112|2.0|I love this game, but a Ford video ad in the ad free version I paid money for is unacceptable.
B000NDHWT6|5.0|The CD came as discribed, in a new lift lock case, the booklet is in great shape, and the CD looked, and play wonderful. I have been to Rockaway, and it great to know they still stock the rarities.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book! I was hesitant to read it, not wanting another poorly written fantasy book. 1 chapter in and I had a HUGE grin on my face and KNEW it was going to be a great book. Lately all the fantasy books have been so unoriginal. This author has a very compelling writing style and the characters are well written. I loved that it wasn't all about sex, but more romantic. I think the author was so creative. It's hard to take the idea of vampire and witches and write a unique story about it. She made it her own. The book made me laugh out loud and even tear up. I couldn't put it down and am eagerly waiting the next book! I never write reviews and am very, very picky with books- trust me, read this book.
B004G6009U|5.0|I found this DVD to thoroughly enjoyable.  Picture quality is of the utmost clarity.  The music and the acting was believeable and at the same time very much a fairy tale.  I recommend this film to anyone who likes Disney and the fairy tale medium.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This movie has everything, in balance: humor, love, tradition, shame, individuality, loyalty, reflection, growth, etc., etc.  Among the small group of best movies I've seen in my life.  The movie shows Japanese people as individuals within their culture, giving viewers a sensitive and honest glimpse behind the formal curtain. The story is beautiful!
B0026OE2NY|5.0|Saw part of this on YOUTUBE and had to get my own copy. After seeing what it was all about, I sent links to everyone I knew to let them know that they must buy a copy of this in HD. If you own an HD TV and you're one of those that stands in the store and watch the sharp demos on the floor sets, this video will not disapoint you and at the same time get an actual update on the condition of world and how man's abuse of the natural resorces is criminal.
B003YCI1O8|5.0|My boyfriend love this movie and knew we had to have it on blu-ray. I was hesistant since some transfers leave much to be desired, but this one looks excellent! No changes I could see with the movie and loved every minute of it!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This extension arm is great!!! The gray finish is very nice and its versatility is awesome.  I'm using it to hold a 19\\" monitor well.. tv.  I lay back in my lazy boy with my cordless keyboard and mouse. When i'm finished all i have to do is swing the tv to the side and go on my way.  With my experience, a great purchase.
0553579908|5.0|The first book, 'A Game of Thrones', was well suited to it's name, just as book two 'A Clash of Kings'. With an unexpected and horrible death at the end of book one, it was hard to predict what would happen in 'A Clash of Kings' other than the inevitable period of war. Anyone is game to die at this point and anyone can claim to be King of the realm. Martin is keen on amplifying the grotesque, never letting the reader forget how dehumanizing and brutal war can be. Sometimes the detailed harshness of certain burn-and-pillage scenes really jolted me but it only serves to show how strong of a writer Martin is. There is a rather morbid undertone to this epic book, many of the characters who are quite dark lose all their humanity and you fear for those few characters who still believe in honor, loyalty and serving the realm. The moral compass seems to point straight North to the Starks and as far away as possible from the Lannisters. Also, the series loses one narrator and gains two more. Overall, 'A Clash of Kings' gives you insight into the complexities of a warring period, how no one can be trusted and anyone with men behind them a potential threat. A multitude of men die throughout the novel, so try not to get too attached to any one character. The novel ends with continued mystery, which led me to pick up the third book, 'A Storm of Swords'. I would recommend the second book for those who have read the first, but don't expect it to cheer your mood. It is dense and leaves you feeling somewhat weary/disturbed.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|pretty awesome at first, but once you see the same pattern over and over again, it just gets tiring. add some new algorithms or something please!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|This is a great movie and is a wonderful addition to my Blu-Ray collection. The Blu-Ray + DVD pack is excellent!
030746363X|5.0|There are many good tips for better health through some unusual exercises and diet choices.  I am still hoping to try out some of the sex advice.
B004NCLKJG|5.0|Just look at this cast.  Birgit Nilsson in absolute prime with high Cs blazing, Jon Vickers in one of his best roles also in prime, Leonie Rysanek in the role she owned from the early 50s till she switched to mezzo soprano (roughly 25 years, Christa Ludwig in  her younger days as a perfect Fricka, Thomas stewart in his best role, and Karl Ridderbusch who was a perfect Hunding.  Add to that Klobucar's conducting and you have a performance of really thrilling nature.  This is not a studio job, spliced together after weeks of recording.  it's a performance.  Yes, I heard Jon Vickers make a wrong entrance, but so what?  After about 1 minute the slightly restricted sound hits our ears with easy balance and power.      For those who want to know, Vickers holds \\"Wälse\\" a long time.  Rysanek does scream (it's called for but usually omitted), and Nilsson sings huge high Cs.  The performance flows with a natural ease that surely must have helped the singers along.  With performances like this, no wonder this is one of the most popular operas of the Ring.    This shows us how singers actually sound in performance.  No enhancement by mikes or echo chambers.      Now, how about Nilsson and Hopf in Siegfried?
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George...tired of making excuses for your obvious disregard for the fans that have created your fortune. You've lost all credibility,  sad.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|It's true, all the hype surrounding Fleet Foxes and this album, and it actually lives up to it.  I was getting a little bored with Robin Pecknold, feited by Uncut magazine (do yourself a favour, the most relevant music mag out there)as a meister of new music, based on the two albums (1's an EP) from 2008 and I'm sure, superb live performances, but they haven't been to New Zealand.  Yet!!!  Three years seems a long time between drinks in the new age where everything should be instantaneous, shouldn't it?  so there was I (unkindly)  and cynically, thinking what's all the fuss about.  Mumford and Son's happened followed by the new Decemberists album and Duke and the King and dare I say it I was thinking \\"Has Beens\\" before they'd even really started.    Well I don't mind acknowledging when I'm wrong and I guess in retrospect, that Fleet Foxes were under all sorts of pressure to live up to their billing. and build on their initial releases.  They've spent a long time away from the release parade, doing tours, being ill and recording/recording/recording and the resulting album is worth it.  I'm going to say its the best new album of 2011, along with J Mascis, and in fact I'm sooooo taken with it that i think its probably the best new album of the decade and very very representative of where good new, indie/alt/cosmic americana is going.    The albums sound is definitively Fleet foxes, and what they've done is create a suite of song's where every one adds to the whole, a bit like those great CSN, and CSNY early albums where it all tied together with a great lead track, followed by a cluster of very strong songs.  In terms of specific highlights, well its like Fleet foxes played \\"Amnesiac\\" before every session.  Lo Fi, gorgeous guitar and additional instrumentation phases (too many new ideas to mention here)and really got into it.  The Plains/Bitter Dancer could be CSN in terms of the vocal harmony beauty.  \\"Montezuma\\" and \\"Helplessness Blues\\" are key tracks too. Sim Sala Bim is as esoteric and obscure as it is charmming and melodic, this is where the genius comes in.  It's wrong of me to pick out any highlights, the album is a highlight as a whole a momentous piece which will add to the growing legend.    I think if Gram Parson's were alive today he would approve, this is definitely Cosmic American music, the concept as described by Ingram, manufactured to a masterful level.    Enough of the gushing, buy it, play it frequently and enjoy the fruit of the most talented band (sorry Wilco) around now.
B0001MLMKY|4.0|Contrary to many of the reviews that I have seen, I have not had an issue with the band snapping. The watch looks great and has a unique Swatch style. My only criticism is that every month or so, the date number gets stuck between two different numbers for a day. Nevertheless, this is a unique item. I wear it as much as my Seiko 5, my Eco-Drive, and my quartz Seiko, yet it cost less than any of these. The crystal has not scratched in two months of ownership, although it is not as high quality as a Hardex or sapphire one would be.
B0027ZEHGO|5.0|While I'm kind of sick of Michael Moore movies, in light of all the negative media about the new US healthcare legislation, I decided I needed to watch this to hear a viewpoint. Truly amazing video and I wish and I had seen it earlier. Will buy copies for gifts because I think it is important for each of us to see it. Don't worry, it is entertaining and educational as well.
1433521784|5.0|In short you can't get a better made study bible both in content and manufacture. The Cowhide Leather is so good i want all my books to be made like this.   The pages are the finest on the market and the detail is great. If your looking for a great study bible that you will enjoy for a very long time then look no further, this is it.
0783219695|5.0|This is a very good version of Apollo 13.  The special features are great and very informative, they really add to the impact of the movie.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|then stopped.  calls out to amazon app store on initial startup, then fails.  not having this issue with any other amazon app store apps that i can recall, even after creating backups of them.
0670022411|3.0|I had read many good reviews of this book but was disappointed. The pace is very slow (it's about 100 pages too long) and the writing only so-so. The scientific aspects (DNA, etc) were intriguing but the author doesn't sustain the reader's interest in them. I found the characterizations trite except for Matthew, who does come to life on the page. I am forcing myself to finish the book but keep falling asleep each night I pick it up!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|You tell that slime-sucking, worm-ridden piece of filth that he'll get no such pleasure from us until he releases the theatrical version of the original trilogy! Right?
0811868419|5.0|This book is just darling.  I gavee it to my husband for Christmas and even he appreciated it (it is a bit on the sappy side).  I want to get a few copies to hand out as gifts whenever the occasion calls for it.
1439190275|5.0|I bought this book at the end of March. I started Atkins 6 weeks ago, and already down about 15+ pounds. This change is amazing and works when done correctly.   I did cheat one day, and went right back on track the next day, so far so good. I plan to make this the way of life.   When I want to taste something like cake or rice, I taste it by chewing it, then spitting it out so I can just get the taste but not the sugar in my body. This works and I recommend it to anyone wanting to loose weight.   After I had my son 3 years ago, I tried Herbalife 4 different times, at 3 month intervals, and it did not work. Atkins worked within 2 weeks and I feel great. ty Atkins.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|i had no problems   with this  seller  or  the product   it was   excellent
B0002F6AH0|5.0|But of course it is made by a British jew. All the Germans in this movie are just like we like em. Imagine a series made by the Germans (if they had won the war)..full of German speaking Brits, happy because their evil country lost. History is written by the victors.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It's not just a little quibble - it's a key element of the character's personality - when someone is waving a gun in your face, saying they're going to kill you now, finger on the trigger - you don't wait! It makes Han Solo the character he is - not the idealized hero that always lets the bad guy get the first shot in.     I don't care about all the updates to the graphics, I can even deal with Jabba allowing Han to walk on his tail without ordering him killed - but to change Han's character like that - it's a substantial and major part of the film. Without that - no sale. Not ever.
