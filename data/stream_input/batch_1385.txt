B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it to store recipes so I can access the recipes anywhere...on vacation or at the grocery store.  Also great as a notepad while traveling. I put travel info here so it accessible any time. You can also jot down notes on restaurants or sites you have visited.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This is a great book if you enjoy fantasy novels.  It is rich in detail and story lines.  I had to read the whole series so I could get to the end.  It was money well spent.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|This book is fantastic. For anyone who is a fan of the television show, this book is perfect. Even if you have never seen the TV show, give this book a try. The writing is very good but we all know that Richard Castle is only a fictional character, so who is actually writing these novels, Grisham, Cannell? I have no idea (yes, I tried to find out) but once again the writing is superb. Check out the TV show and read the books, neither will let you down.<br /><br />Peter Moore - Author of Copyright and Skip-Trace
B004V6VGHU|5.0|Excellent book. I couldn't put it down. I'm anxious to read the rest of the books by Betty Smith. I was surprised to learn that this book is actually the author's life. I love any story written in this Era.
B005NJFSZK|5.0|Of all the 1:55 scale models Mattel is offering from the \\"World Grand Prix\\" in Cars 2, this one has to be one of the best.<br /><br />Lewis is a beautiful Le Mans-style prototype race car with beautiful detail and superb paint.  He's a lovely deep green, with nice decals and wheel details.  These models are good enough to fascinate me, as well as my four-year-old boy.<br /><br />They're made of hefty die-cast, and are slightly larger than regular Hot Wheels cars.<br /><br />Boys and girls with a fascination for the movie, or simply with race cars in general, will certainly appreciate Lewis Hamilton, in all his English glory!<br /><br />My boy remembers Lewis as the car from the movie who \\"never crashes,\\" which is true.  Lewis does a good job of avoiding the bad guys throughout the movie!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love the game. Excellent graphics and gamepkay. Worth every penny. I'm confused about one thing though -how do some people have over 200 stars on Feint? I've gotten all the stars and medals available and I only have 153. Is there an add on to the game?
B0068RHGJM|5.0|I saw the Imaginaerum at the Universal Amphitheater. Incredible is all I can say... was no ordinary \\"concert\\"... this thing took you somewhere... it brought you home for a bit, then took you back, and so on and so on.<br />Was one of those \\"nights of my life\\" that is now etched into my memory!<br />Always and Forever a Nightwish fan!!!
0385342063|5.0|I've been reading Sophie Kinsella's books for years now! I was thrilled to see a new title from her! D moment the book was in my hand, i quickly flip to the first pages and started to read ... and read ... and read! That was how addictive it is! I love the character \\"Poppy Wyatt\\" and she reminded me of Becky from the shoppaholic series. I'd say it is good read and it has brighten up my gloomy week! Thxx Sophie! XxXxXx
1451627289|5.0|This is the best of King's novels that I have read in a long time, set in a time period that I identify with. It was just the right mixture of nostalgia, suspense, atmosphere, and plot to keep me reading toward the end, hoping at the same time that it wouldn't end. Ordering from Amazon is a breeze, giving me immediate and affordable access to the best and latest from my favorite authors.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This is an exciting book, as most people know, and the movie will be out soon. I have to say some of the images are haunting and I'm not sure it's the best read for kids, tho I get that they love it. The female heroine is great. But the stories are pretty far fetched with little humor anywhere. Not my favorite, but I realize I'm in the minority. I'm nearly done with the 2nd book in the series and feel the same way about it. The strongest message in the book seems to be \\"whatever CAN possibly go wrong, WILL go wrong.\\" If that's your style, go for The Hunger Games.
B005FJ7EIC|2.0|I liked the idea of a slow burn vampire movie.  Unfortunately, this burn doesn't lead to anything in the end.  It was acted well enough and all, it just wasn't a very good script.
1603429999|5.0|[[ASIN:1603429999 Circular Knitting Workshop: Essential Techniques to Master Knitting in the Round]] by Margaret Radcliffe is a book for all knitting levels and for all knitters who wish to knit in the round.  The patterns include sweaters, vests, hats, socks, mittens, gloves and shawls.  There is a nice review of the types of needles required for knitting in the round.  Types of casting on and joining are covered, along with ways to avoid tight cast ons and loose cast ons.  Five basic cast ons are covered: the half-hitch cast-on, the knitted cast-on, the cable cast-on, the ribbed cable cast-on and the long-tail cast-on, all of which are useful for knitting.  There is a nice section on finishing techniques and a nice section on ways to convert flat to circular.<br /><br />The projects are versatile and useful but the main strength of this book is the encyclopedic information it provides for knitting in the round.  Whether you're new to knitting in the round or you are an old-timer, there will likely be information in this book that will be helpful to you.  I recommend the book based on this information rather than on the patterns which are basic and can be found most anywhere.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Just amazing really like the game and it gets hard running on galaxy II.<br /><br />Great flow.  Really good physics.  I would recommend to anyone.

B000FQIRXQ|5.0|Everyone's favorite Dickens tale gets an outstanding treatment by the BBC and an all-star cast that includes the incomparable Maggie Smith, Bob Hoskins, Ian McKellen, Alun Armstrong, Imelda Staunton, and pre-Potter Daniel Radcliffe.  The cinematography is excellent, landscapes could come straight from a \\"Best of Britain\\" calendar, costumes and sets and characterizations are true to the book and to the time.  The production is presented in two sections, the first dealing with the young David, anchored by Radcliffe who already showed promise of the actor he would grow to be.  The adult David of the second section (Ciaran McMenamin) is weaker, but the strength of the story carries all to a satisfactory conclusion.  The measured delivery of Tom Wilkinson's narration adds much to the overall production.  The bonus program \\"Dickens' Favorite Child\\" really is a bonus, nearly as interesting to watch as the story itself.  This is a truly beautiful production, one of the BBC's very best.
B005X7HA6C|5.0|I won't repeat what others already say, but this is a terrific movie and had some nice unexpected twists. Great directing and acting.
B006OAB3ME|2.0|You must be very much in a romantic mood for this CD, or really tired.  It's quite slow.  I DID however, like his own song, \\"My Valentine\\".  It'll be a classic.
B000050HNS|5.0|With a few minor exceptions this original version is a much tighter, focused & far superior edit to the rambling Redux version, often the artists are not always the best judge of their own work, like many great directors/artists  even Coppola needs some contraits to weed-out the superflous scenes to make the movie flow better.<br /><br />Yes the Redux has it's values to afficianadios,and fans but this is a much better punchy version IMHO.<br /><br />BTW I have seen the 3.5 hr workprint version and it is a masterpiece but only for real movie buffs who enjoy unused scenes &<br />the pure genious of the camera work, set design, music score & unused characters like Scot Glen (who shot himself ??)<br /><br />Even Brando's pudgy USA soundstage poetic ramblings are pure magic.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This is one of the best puzzle games you can get on the Kindle Fire. Much better than its free counterpart. All you people giving cruddy reviews, just leave it alone and try the game. Very challenging. I suggest it.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|The title and the actors interested me, but I was so very disappointed. It took at least 60% of the movie before there was any decent, but still limited dialogue. The movie was mostly just music and scenery, even animation from prehistoric times. Sorry but it was a waste of my time and money. I couldn't see the point of its production. I just could not relate to it in general since I was looking for entertainment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my dream book and I'm glad I bought it.  I was not so sure about itbatbfirst but I just st down and started to read it and got really into it.  I am a preteen and it was appropriate for kids my age.  My dad, mom, 5th grade brother read it and they loved it too.
B005GYGCOI|4.0|I could not have imagined traveling to India without this guide. This was my second trip and the newer edition of this book was just as useful as the first one. In a country where cleanliness, hygiene, honesty and customer service standards very wildly from one place to the next, this guide will help you navigate with relative safety. It's a goldmine of well delivered information when it comes to restaurants, hotels, and sights. I also find the cultural/historical part to be very well written as well as interesting. As a minus, I would say that the way the map are located in the book, is not always ideal to navigate as you need to keep going back and forth between maps and written information. Other than that, very good.<br /><br />Do avoid the kindle edition as it's extremely difficult to navigate to the point of being useless.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|FYI to anyone who downloaded this developer's Easy Money app ($9.95) on 01/19/12, you already have this \\"app.\\"  All the functions of this app are already included in Easy Money.<br /><br />I'm staring at this app wondering where I've seen it before, and then I recalled the previous FAOTD several weeks ago.  I actually had to delete Easy Money because a) I really didn't use it, and b) It runs all day long with no ability to kill it, keeps coming back, and used quite a bit of RAM while I didn't even have the app open.  I was bothered by that and, well, just like all my RAM available for when I need to open up those \\"power apps\\" that need a lot of RAM on the startup without having to go to an app manager to close everything not needed first.<br /><br />In reality, you can't trust android to handle the RAM situation for you perfectly every time, even though it SHOULD and even though it TRIES.  I noticed several times that opening a new app force closed if I used it after having the phone on several hours, but did NOT crash if I was on a fresh reboot and killed unnecessary apps running the background.<br /><br />So, although the app is useful, I'd advise you to go look to see if you installed Easy Money on 01/19/12, and if you did, you not only have THIS app, you have about what the developer feels is about $7.00 worth of even MORE features that you may find useful.  I myself just prefer Mint because I have no intention of taking the time to input anything anywhere if someone else can do it for me and send me alerts on all of it.  But if you have no interest in putting in your bank accounts information or credit card numbers, or even your utilities information, into an app to feel extra secure, this may be a decent substitute.<br /><br />If you go look at Easy Money, and you have no interest in it, and just prefer the smaller selection of features that THIS app provides, then it's a good download for you (especially for free).  If you want more, and think Easy Money maybe for you (it just wasn't for me), then go check out what else it provides and see if you're interested .... or just check your phone!  It just may be laying there covered with dust in your app folder if you're a FAOTD frequent flyer!

B004SYP5WC|2.0|This app looks uncannily exactly like the \\"Easy Money\\" app. Looks like they just tweaked the name and resubmitted it as a new app! if that is true, what does that say of the author who encourages us to use his app for our most intimate issues, personal finance?

B000A7S4B0|4.0|Great album! I'm not a huge fan of Black Rebel's first two albums (\\"B.R.M.C.\\" and \\"Take Them On, On Your Own\\"). However, this is a completely different world from the previous two. On the first two albums Black Rebel went for a somewhat more distorted \\"grungy\\" sound, somewhat reminiscent of The Jesus and Mary Chain. \\"Howl\\", on the other hand, has a much more acoustic, 60's rock feel to it. The title of the album, after all, was taken from Allen Ginsberg poem of the same name. The album is in a similar vain as guitarist Peter Hayes previous band: The Brian Jonestown Massacre. From the very opening track of \\"Shuffle Your Feet\\" to the epic closing of \\"The Line\\" this is a great rock and roll album. As a matter the entire album has embraced a blues/country feel. Gone are the electric guitars and welcome the harmonicas, acoustic jams and handclaps. Songs such as \\"Complicated Situation\\", \\"Devil's Waitin\\" and \\"Still Suspicion Holds You Tight\\" are high water marks for me, personally. \\"Shuffle Your Feet\\" has a gospel feel to it that remains throughout the entire album and is revisited on such tracks as \\"Gospel Song\\". In addition, not only have BRMC found a new sound, they have found God too. Many of the songs, from \\"Restless Sinner\\" to \\"Devils Waitin\\" deal with ideas of religion, God and the Devil. The album on a whole has a much more elegant and relaxed feel to it. If you're looking for the dirty rock sound of early BRMC, look elsewhere. If you want to listen to some thoughtful, passionate, acoustic blues rock, you have come to the right place.

B0014J8D9Q|2.0|This blue ray movie was very disappointing in it's color and clarity. The DVD I already have is almost as good. Bottom line , I would not purchase this blue ray movie as an upgrade. It is not worth the money. Amazon should place all blue rays movies in a group. In the future I will go to other sources for reviews and purchases.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Today I received \\"The Coppola Restoration\\" with great anticipation.<br />I was shocked and amazed when after only the first few minutes I realized that the english subtitles are abridged, missing the actual dialog of the actors.<br />In recent years, with diminished hearing, I have come to depended upon subtitles to allow me to not miss the nuances of the dialog.<br />For me this is an extremely unfortunate error.<br />For those watching with me I will offer them ear plugs for I have the volume way up as we watch this wonderful remastering.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book - a lot.  While I loved Jacob's accomplishments I had great difficulty in moving beyond what an absolute jerk he was.  Having worked for a few tyrants, I find I could not get beyond how horribly he treated others.  To accept his behavior because his accomplishments were so grand is something I simply will not do!  I do not admire him or like him at all and nothing will change my opinion in this regard.  His biggest \\"hang up\\" was being abandoned by his 23 year old parents when he was still an infant.  So what does he do with his infant daughter when he is age 23 or so -- he abandons her!!  I rest my case.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Finally!!! After the long wait this is released in the U.S. And it was well worth it. I really enjoyed revisiting this show as it was one of my favorites as a child. Now, if only the rest of the seasons would be released.
0062119044|2.0|I was pretty excited to crack open this book. However, the only reason I got to the 50 page mark was because I was in the emergency room getting rabies shots and I was bored. It is simply inconceivable that a cultured, self-absorbed woman of the world as portrayed here would write insanely long, rambling, poetic letters to an estranged redneck husband who thrives on hotdogs, six packs, pick up trucks and dirty talk, and probably can't even read well enough to understand what in the hell she's saying. Really, that's what you get in the first 50 pages. There is no way in hell these two characters would have fallen in love and attempted a marriage, much less raise children together. I cannot waste my time on a book that is simply unbelievable and pretentious from page one. If I ever have to get rabies shots again, I'll just stare at the wall.
0452289963|5.0|Great book to help you relearn about the world and yourself from a different perspective!  Become more aware of you and how you effect yourself and the world around you rather than the other way around.  Also it does it in a non-corny way =).

B001DM3Q2S|5.0|A lot of mixed reviews yet it's hard to believe this was a direct to video movie with the two big name actors in it and being as good as I thought it was but guess you are seeing more of that nowadays with more movies being released that way.  Was quite original as well and never got bored watching it, kept my attention well from start to end, nice story to it as well.  I am not a big Morgan Freeman fan but liked his role here very much.  Would highly recommend it to any movie fan who likes suspense, drama, or action.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B006YTYIXG|5.0|Max Cavalera has been taking Soulfly in a heavier direction for several albums now, but the last one, Omen, slowed things down somewhat.  Now, Enslaved is here to kick everything back into massive overdrive.  This CD will cave in a few skulls when unsuspecting listeners pop it in and wait for Max to \\"go through the motions\\" with some standard groove metal.  These songs resemble Sepultura's sound more than any other Soulfly release, but it's not a straight Sep sound; you can hear the unmistakable stamp of both bands in almost every song.  Cavalera and company thrash it out from one track to the next, refusing to let up for a moment.  Even the slower sections crush, like on Legions and American Steel, where the groove is more about head-stomping than jumping around.  Combined with their past discography, this album solidifies Soulfly's legacy as a top-tier metal band.  Incredible.<br /><br />By the third and fourth Soulfly albums, the band seemed to have grown comfortable with a familiar formula, giving the impression in their music of repetition and simplicity, which also carried over into the song arrangements.  Lyrics kept getting more and more simplistic, songs got shorter, and a certain lack of fire spawned many Soulfly critics who suggested Max was losing some of his creativity.  Enslaved puts those notions to rest.  Each song is fleshed out; they all feel complete in a way they didn't on Omen, and to some extent, Conquer.  Riffs have more drive, new drummer Dave Kinkade absolutely rips it up on drums, and new bassist Tony Campos lays a crushing bottom-heavy foundation.  Much of the melody brought by Marc Rizzo on the last few albums has been replaced with pure speed and aggression, though his skills still shine with some choice classical and flamenco interludes.  Make no mistake, Max was out to make a statement with Enslaved, and he's succeeded.  I'm happy to say this is a full-fledged five-star album for Max Cavalera and Soulfly!  For anyone interested, here's a closer look at a few highlights.<br /><br />Resistance--Short intro track with some Chaos A.D. power-drill guitars and shouted-word vocals.<br /><br />World Scum--Death metal destruction with Cattle Decapitation vocalist.<br /><br />Intervention--Relentless thrash assault with old-school sound.<br /><br />American Steel--Meaty riffing, powerful drumming, and a HEAVY breakdown.<br /><br />Redemption of Man by God and Treachery--Ultra-heavy speed-groove, with nice vocals by Dez from Devildriver on Redemption.<br /><br />Plata O Plomo--Old Soulfly tradition of Portuguese lyrics with a stomping beat and great riffs.<br /><br />Chains--Epic track, over seven minutes, that runs the gamut of Soulfly's metal repertoire with thrash, groove, and even a blast beat.<br /><br />Revengeance--Max and his sons finish the album with an almost Nailbomb sense of industrial heaviness.<br /><br />Great bonus tracks on the special edition include the thrasher Slave, which ends with some classic lines from Tribe off the first Soulfly album.  Next, Bastard might be the most standard track of the whole collection, sounding like a basic groove-based Soulfly song that could be on just about any release.  Finally, the eighth installment of the Soulfly instrumentals is the first to incorporate a violin, throwing an entirely new twist on the spiritual, tribal element for which these tracks have come to be known, and strengthening the overall sense that each musician involved put everything they had into the making of Enslaved.a closer look at a few highlights.<br /><br />Resistance--Short intro track with some Chaos A.D. power-drill guitars and shouted-word vocals.<br /><br />World Scum--Death metal destruction with Cattle Decapitation vocalist.<br /><br />Intervention--Relentless thrash assault with old-school sound.<br /><br />American Steel--Meaty riffing, powerful drumming, and a HEAVY breakdown.<br /><br />Redemption of Man by God and Treachery--Ultra-heavy speed-groove, with nice vocals by Dez from Devildriver on Redemption.<br /><br />Plata O Plomo--Old Soulfly tradition of Portuguese lyrics with a stomping beat and great riffs.<br /><br />Chains--Epic track, over seven minutes, that runs the gamut of Soulfly's metal repertoire with thrash, groove, and even a blast beat.<br /><br />Revengeance--Max and his sons finish the album with an almost Nailbomb sense of industrial heaviness.<br /><br />Great bonus tracks on the special edition include the thrasher Slave, which ends with some classic lines from Tribe off the first Soulfly album.

B004SYP5WC|4.0|I agree with everyone that talks about the simplicity and the absolute usefulness. although I use and love Mint for quick access to all my accounts I didn't care for the bill reminder portion. I just wish this app synched so I wouldn't have to add all my bills on my phone and my xoom.  confused why folk can't figure out the multi week/month options.  quarterly is every 3 months. biweekly paycheck is every 2 weeks.  am I missing something? the first thing I did...OK the 3rd...was put on my property tax bill which is twice a year. this beats Mint's bill reminder hands down.

B0072X2O66|2.0|Mike Portnoy and Russell Allen are two of my favorite working musicians, and their contributions to the genre of prog metal are undeniable. That's why it's so disheartening to hear what they've offered up on Omerta. It's dull, it's done, and it's instantly forgettable. I listened to it a few times through and I'll be damned if I can remember a single riff, lick, or lyric. The album really does focus on guitarist Mike Orlando, who's trying so hard to be Zakk Wylde it's depressing.<br /><br />I'm glad Allen has Symphony X, and that Portnoy has other side-projects, because this band is just \\"there\\" for me. Not offensively bad -- but I would certainly expect something more musically interesting than this fast food value meal of an album.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this series. After the first 50 pages I was hooked. I dare anyone one not to get caught up in the characters and the images Suzanne Collins paints in your mind. I am almost nervous to see the movies now because I have such a vivid picture of the characters and panem and the arenas in my mind. Love the serives and highly recommend it.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I've been using this alarm clock for a while now. I love all the features that it has. My favorite is the volume slowly turning up and the range of time that you can have it take before it gets to your full set volume. I've never had any problems with it. Simply put, it's awesome.

Full stage props and action as if I were in the theater watching it live.  Needless to say, I am very happy with my purchase and will be watching this blu-ray in full glory many times.<br /><br />Jay
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|If you read this book and you think it's violent you are right. But it is also very adventurous, and I like the sense of despair because the capitol is hated by the districts there is a rebellion. There is also a lot of love and Snow is clever he uses peoples weaknesses a lot. The Hunger Games is really good I stayed up till midnight reading it and I'm only 11 years old.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|Amazing album.  Anthony Gonzalez takes you on a trip to a truly unique place.  The minute I put on the CD I feel like I am whisked away to some fantasy world.  I was hestitant to see a double CD but there is not a bad song on the album and I don't mind the 1/2 minute interludes that connect song to song.  It is really a work of art.  It almost doesn't seem right to listen to one or two songs.  Make it a point to set aside time to listen to the album in full and let yourself get lost in \\"HurryUp, WereDreaming.\\"
B0011Z8SPW|5.0|So, I won't act like I didn't judge this band a tad bit before I got to know them. I had them chalked up to a Pop-punk (two words I cringe to put together) flash in the pan. Normally if something is really well known and popular I tend to think it's crappy and leave it for the fan girls. But I am never too proud to say I'm wrong, and oh how wrong I was. The tone was set with \\"The only difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage\\", a catchy little number that had a dark message I could shake my ass to. If you listen to the words on \\"Nails for breakfast, tacks for snacks\\" you might just become a better person, I think I did. Same goes for \\"Time to dance\\", I mean these guys are good at making hard topics fun to listen about. And I think thats it; I had fun listening to this album. And Isn't music supposed to be fun? All and all I'm glad I didn't let my own self importance get in the way of awesome music, I hope you don't either. (oh and P.S. \\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\\" made me poop out of love....)
B006MHWXMS|1.0|Using HTV Evo Shift 4G:<br /><br />Another user commented about how this app should be able to work without a Google account. I agree completely. Every time I open the app it asks me to sync it with a Google account. Moreover, every time I switch the mode of the phone to portrait or landscape, it asks me to sync to a Google account. There should be an option to turn that off so it can stop bugging me about it.<br /><br />Aside from that, every time a create a new task, new list, or exit out of the app and come back in, it restores my original tasks lists. It isn't deleting my tasks, but below the lists I've created tasks in are new lists: Work, Personal, and Others. They put new lists in every time, whether I delete them or not. So if I forget that it does this, I go to my Summary and see 15 task lists instead of 4. In addition to this, while it's adding those lists, it adds the original task back to my personal list, talking about syncing with a Google account or whatever. No matter how many times I check it off or delete it, it still comes back with a vengeance.<br /><br />I read in another review that people should stop complaining about Google syncing issues because it is an Android phone-Google's OS. I can understand that point of view, and I might have agreed until March 1 when they inducted their shady policy and lost the trust of the people that actually care about their privacy and information. I'll still use the phone for the next year, but that doesn't mean I have to just bend over and take it until I get a new one. I'm not syncing anything, and I should have the option to use this app without a sync.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|I love Marian's work and this one is my favourites.  The characters are all loveable, the story flows smoothly and it is LOL funny.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Of course we love Michael Buble, and any records he does, so this was especially delightful for the holidays. Would recommend and album he is on.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|ive been a power metal fan since i got a stormwitch record called tales of terror when i was 7 or 8 years old, that record changed my life back in 1988, ever since ive collected and worshipped metal. needless to say i know a good album when i hear one. i was introduced to symphony x when i bought divine wings of tragedy many years ago. i knew they had something special about them and even though it was not my favorite album i was going to keep this band on my radar. i eventually bought the killer album titled v. it was full of beautiful, technical,rememberable songs that just took you on this mellodic journey. it had beauty and power and was created out of pure talent. however i got out of touch with this band not long after and started working on completing my collection of my favorite bands such as running wild,stormwitch,primal fear,morgana lefay ,mercyful fate, any thing by d.c. cooper or jorn land or lance king, and so on. i kept hearing appearences from symphony x singer russel allen on alot of new albums i had purchased, like ayreon,s universal migrator part 2, star ones killer space metal album, avantasia, and the killer allen/lande albums. and you know every one of these were friggin awesome, i was amazed at how versatile and ranged russel allans vocals are. and i just happend to come across this album iconoclast. i heard they got heavier and a little less technical so i had to give this album a try. i was blown away. this is a crushing heavy album. michael romeo has come up with some amazing crushing and catchy metal guitar riffs and russel allen sings his tail off, it is nice to get to hear him just roarr his head off and give it all hes got. he screams his lungs out and still sounds awesome. i love this sound for him, i mean we all know he can make you melt with a ballad and rock your socks off with mid tempo anthems but this cd shows he can get right up there in matt barlowes range or ripper owens,or ralf scheepers in terms of high yelling lung power. the guitar work is amazing and if you are a metal guitar enthusiast you will be in awe at the riffs and complex master soloing and shredding from m.romeo. on this album. the drums are up there with the likes of mike terrana and randy black or jorg michael. i mean this drummer symphony x has is incredible, he has a real future in this music.i have bought so many albums recently that are just a few good songs here and there and mostly fillers, so it is nice to get a cd that i can listen to from beginning to end and not have to change the track constantly. this entire album rocks and there is not one filler. i thought track 7 was a filler but once it really gets started it is a great song as well, it sounds like their older stuff. some people may be mad because they have slightly changed their sound but dont give up on them, give this cd a try. this is straight forward shredding power metal the way it was meant to be. if you want more keyboard laden epic power metal then get their older cd,s or check out sonata arctica,or celesty. but if you want to be piledrived like you were when you first heard ride the lightning or painkiller then you better not pass this up. i will not lose touch with this band again. with this release symphony x has made a believer out of me and gained a new die hard fan as well. keep the flame burning, we metallians are brothers and have to stick together to the end. posers suck
B002VPEAOE|4.0|\\"The House At Riverton\\" is like a long walk on a beautiful day: I couldn't get enough of it.<br />Grace is our narrator, a 98 year old woman recalling her life in service at Riverton House beginning in 1914 for an upcoming film on an infamous suicide that took place there. Naturally, there are many unknown facts about the incident and the family that surrounds it. Grace tells her story in a rich, lyrical, and atmospheric way that will have you spellbound.<br />The book has two mysteries that drive it along. Without giving too much away, I'll say: The first is easily solved by the reader early in the story. When it is revealed towards the end of the book, there is not much time or explanation given for it. That is the only reason this book doesn't rate at 5 stars for me. I would very much have liked to have known more details of the original incident. As well as more reasoning by Grace for her actions after she figured it out.<br />The second mystery starts on the first page and literally ends on the last. It surrounds the apparent suicide of poet, RJ Hunter as witnessed by the two Hartford sisters, Hannah and Emmeline. The three share a childhood past where they are all bound by their love for the girls brother, David. What drove one to suicide years later?<br />I found myself absorbed in every page and was sorry when this book ended, as it was such an engrossing read. Ms. Morton should be commended for capturing the time period and conveying it to us so well. Each character had a soul we knew well.... including Riverton House.<br />I immediately ordered Kate Morton's follow-up book upon finishing.
0393064476|5.0|Greenblatt's The Swerve is one of the best-written history books I've read in years. As an ex-Catholic, I thought I knew the worst of church history. Was I surprised. Poggio Bracciolini's rescue of Lucretius's work may not have been the sole instigation for The Renaissance, and I did not see where Greenblatt's claimed that, as some reviewers here seemed quick to assert. But clearly the rediscovery of this and other ancient manuscripts hidden by a power-hungry and defensive Vatican led many educated people to say, \\"hey, I can think for myself. I can learn by observing.\\" Just the documents and letters Greenblatt incorporates are a treasure to us all.<br /><br />Roger S. Peterson<br />Rocklin, California

B001NLKT60|5.0|After having seen the movie \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo\\" and read the book, this book captured my interest right away. Stieg Larsson balances character development and action in a way that keeps you yearning to read more. I am looking forward to reading the next book to end the trilogy.

1904994679|3.0|I bought this book because I participated in an event that was made a Guinness World Record in December 2010. I checked their website, and the event had been recognized, so I bought the book thinking it would be a cool thing to have. Unfortunately, my event didn't seem important to the editors and was no where to be found. The layout of the book made it very hard to determine this at first, but then I read every single word on every page and saw that it wasn't there. There are a lot of cool things in the book, but if I had known my event wasn't included, I would not have bought it...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for kids specially on road trips . wife and I play for hours at a time its a good app to competing with each other to
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I got this movie as x-mas purchase. Ok flick but was only $10 which beats going to theater for stale over priced popcorn and sticky seating with someone talking on cell phone
B006470HZ6|5.0|I was a big fan of season one and I will say that season two had a slow start but picks up big time midway through the season.  Even though it is a \\"slow\\" start, it is not a \\"bad\\" start.  I think many people were expecting the same thrills we experienced in season one.  Season two has a lot more dialogue and character development which, although not as exciting, becomes necessary for later episodes to be as suspenseful as they are.  Seriously, after around the halfway mark, the episodes are more thrilling and fun than the first season.
0545265355|5.0|Wow!  What can I say about these books - just f a n t a s t i c!  I was gripped from start to finish.  This set a must if you're into suspense and sharp twists.  The trilogy is so so addictive, it's to blame for a succession of sleepless nights.  I'm obsessed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow, what a fantastic series.  Team Peeta all the way...always!!!  Definitely a great read, and I can't wait to see how the books translate onto the big screen.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|App seems to work ok but should be able move it to the SD card. However, can't complain too much since I got it for FR$$EE!
B005723JSQ|5.0|Fantastic read...started off sounding a bit like Rebecca Bloomwood, but then it nicely progressed.  Love the whole concept and there were a lot of lol moments.  I wasn't able to put the book down.  Another well done book by Sophie.  If only she'd write a bit faster and we'd have more books to read from her.
B000TEVIMQ|5.0|Jethro Tull is one of my favorite alltime bands and this mp3 has all their hits! I recommend this to everyone! Also I love the cloud! Amazon MP3 is the best app there is for downloading music to your phone.

0385535139|3.0|The latest legal epic from Grisham will be welcomed by the faithful and continue to puzzle the detractors. I'm kind of in the middle: always interested in the new Grisham, will usually start it, will not always finish. I think the best way to put it is that Grisham is a good storyteller and an average, occasionally OK writer. He made his bones w/ the legal thriller but doesn't always want to write about the law, which is admirable but not always successful. \\"A Painted House\\" was a nice, heartfelt rememberance of long-ago Southern summers. A few of the other non-legal books were put down less than halfway through.<br />\\"The Litagators\\" follows the familiar Grisham formula: young idealistic lawyer fighting the odds. He adds a few fresh details here that mostly work, and rather than have our young hero conquor the case with his brillient legal mind, the litigation here goes quickly from long shot to loser. (That isn't giving anything away).<br />Courtroom dramas are kind of the crack cocaine of fiction, relying on rapid-fire dialogue along with a play-by-play and insight into legal strategy. Grisham handles this very well. He also does well by easing up on the ax-grinding. In the end, you like the book and look forward to more of the same, maybe with a few surprises.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|My kids and I love this game but finished it in 2 days (could have been less time if we weren't busy on those days). PLEASE MAKE MORE LEVELS!
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|excellent read. I learned a lot about India and Afghanistan, The end was not as moving as I had hope but overall it is a great book,  I enjoyed the read and have recommended it to many.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I like puzzle games and I love this game! Some levels require you to fit all the groceries in the bag without breaking them and others you smash all that you can.
B00004W221|1.0|I'm sure we would have enoyed the movie if we had received it.  We received the wrong movie and have to pay S&H to return.  We feel that is Amazon's responisbility, seeing they put the wrong movie in the mailer.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I didn't finish this book. It has to be the worst thing I have ever read. The writing is just nothing, repetitious vocabulary, E. L. James must have been drunk while writing this book. I realize this is a NYT best seller which scares me to think of the low quality people are buying and reading.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it! when I go to church it is so useful all I have to do is bring my kindle fire and it is so great to use when u are my age!!!!!!!

B0044WSF5M|5.0|The movie that inspired the televisoin series \\"Happy Days\\".  Classic 1950's music, classic cars.  Loved this movie when it first came out, was great to see it again.
0307891372|5.0|My husband wanted this guide soo so bad. I went to a few video game stores and some didnt carry it, and some were extremely expensive. I bought this for $16 and its exactly what he wanted! You cant go wrong with the price ;)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book about two years ago when I was in 6th grade. It was pretty much just coming out and only a few people at my school read it at that time. I instantly loved it, I was torn between Peeta and Gale, both amazing guys. I cried at some parts and laughed at others. It's truley amazing. I can also relate with Katniss because she's a tomboy like me and we both shoot bows! I was excited when I heard that. But this book keeps the reader interested and on the edge of their seat. I highly recommend buying it, I'm glad I did because sense way back then I've read it more than ten times. Hope I helped!<br />Crazy4HungerGames
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Good game, simple but enjoyable, and allows for perfecting ones score, by going back and completing the puzzle in the right number of move.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|I bought a ticket to another movie, but had to wait an hour, so I thought I would pass time watching John Carter.<br /><br />As JC began I became swiftly swept up in it, forgetting the other movie entirely, as I was so transported.<br /><br />If you're like me and like movies such Star Wars,  I think you will love this movie. I'm not suggesting that it's better than Star Wars, but I certainly enjoyed it than some Star Wars movies.<br /><br />Like many movies our hero John Carter starts out in the ordinary world, in this case, earth slightly after the civil war.  Our hero, a former soldier now disillusioned, has lost his purpose. Now the army attempts to conscript him into service.  Being resourceful he escapes custody, stealing the captains horse, survives a showdown with Indians, seeks shelter in a secret cave with walls of gold.<br /><br />Something happens that transports him to a special world, Mars, with its own rules, where there is a power struggle, between two factions vying for control of the planet, which threatens the destruction of a group of giant indigenous green people, who ultimately become his allies.<br /><br />Quickly, he is taken captive, but in this special world with its different gravity he has special abilities, which impresses his captors.  Pretty soon he crosses paths with an extremely pretty princess, played by Lynn Collins, who has beauty, brains, and fighting skills.  She definitely is not your typical damsel in distress.  She also has an excellent suntan, sky blue eyes, and a most shapely figure.<br /><br />Though worlds separate him from the princess, as he crosses the distance quickly, we come to understand the loss that fuels his reluctance, and when you watch you will discover the cause that fuels his purpose.<br /><br />I have always loved the Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  As a child I would sit in a tree and stop traffic with my blood curdling Tarzan impersonation.  I was unaware that he had also written the John Carter series.<br /><br />This story follows the same mythological pattern set out by Joseph Campbell in his book The Hero has a Thousand faces.  George Lucas followed this template in creating the Star Wars series, and other movies that follow this pattern include The Matrix,  Batman Begins, and Wanted.  John Carter follows yet precedes the pattern, as the book series was written before Campbells book.<br /><br />Stages of the story include a hero called to adventure, refuses the call, something happens to draw him into adventure, meeting the mentor,  meeting the goddess, crossing the threshold, allies, trials and tests, the inmost cave, mastery of both worlds etc.<br /><br />I loved the imagination and the creation of all these Martian characters.<br /><br />Disney was disappointed with its opening weekend gross of $30 million, which tracked several million below expectation.  Supposedly, the movie cost $250 million to make, but I always take these figures with a grain of salt.  The more expensive the movie is, the more impressed people will be, the more likely people are to watch, so figures can easily become inflated.  I think word of mouth will help this movie enormously.<br /><br />If one likes to be swayed by beauty, then one might enjoy the performance of Lynn Collins. I realised early in the movie, that she had not just beauty but a commanding presence, charisma, and acting talent.  In fact she has a strong grounding as a Shakespearean actor, having appeared in Merchant of Venice with Al Pacino.  I did not recognise her because she had different hair, played a man for at least a portion of that movie, and had a Venetian pallor instead of a Martian suntan, or perhaps a Los Angeles spray tan.<br /><br />So, it's nice to see the studio not cast a name but cast a great talent.<br /><br />I loved this movie.  I think most people will, and I hope this was helpful.series.<br /><br />This story follows the same mythological pattern set out by Joseph Campbell in his book The Hero has a Thousand faces.

B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is great. This is a sci-fi book but it goes much deeper than that. I would recommend this to anybody, sci-fi loving or not.<br /><br />The ending was OK. I could've done with a less \\"softer\\" ending. But the ending is not as important when looking at the whole story as a whole. The final twist is enough. Contrasting Ender with Peter throughout the story and where the both end up is very telling.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|This CD is really good! All the artist on here for the most part do a great to amazing job with each of these dylan Songs. The ending with the Dave Matthews band is just spectacular!
B003CYKCHW|5.0|As usual Amazon delivered quickly, and on time.  It is always a pleasure doing buisness with Amazon.  The mouse feels great in the hand and works great.  It's my favorite gaming mouse i've owned so far.  Although, I do have one critisism, not really a complaint: the mouse is made of all plastic.  It is still well built and solid, but not metal.  Even Logitech and MS, in the same price range, is made of plastic these days, the days of metal costs twice the price.  I only hope it lasts, and does not break after a few months of gamming.  I would buy another RAT again.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|I loved this movie, and I don't love very many of them.  Compelling characters and wonderfully captured footage that puts you right there beside the climbers, shivering in the cold, terrified of the avalanches, grasping for the elusive summit.  Subtitles were hardly noticeable because I was so utterly taken in by this gripping portrayal of true events.  So good.  Enjoy it.

1451627289|5.0|I looked forward to reading this book. I liked the idea it held onto reality with the idea of cause and effect - for ever action there is a reaction. That the energy of the universe is bound and if changed will re-route its course -- and watch out as energy if it's dramatic and devastating can only be the same again. I thought this book is well worth reading.

B004SYP5WC|5.0|I wanted an offline tool similar to a spreadsheet that I use in tandem with my personal finance software which integrates with the banks.  So far this looks great. Super easy to use and lots of canned functionality ready from point of install (think categories/settings).<br />I keep hearing trouble with bi-weekly paychecks... Just set the repeat pattern to weekly and change the number to 2.  Not sure what I am missing but it works fine.<br /><br />Overall seems stable and did I mention easy yet?
0553801473|1.0|I'm giving this one star because after waiting years for the story to pick up again.  This book was more disappointing than the last.  It didn't go anywhere.  In the end we're basically where were with these dragons before the book.  It was more plots more characters, boring, slow, and hard to finish.<br /><br />Hard to finish is the least horrible thing I can say.  I bought this book on pre order years ago.  So I got it as soon as it came out.  I just finished it yesterday.  I've read at least a dozen books since starting this book.  I finally resolved to finish it, and with that decided that this series is done for me.

B000J5XS3C|2.0|Everything on the device works okay. I get low volume feedback, even after buying new cables. Not a huge deal because i'm able to remove most of it with software, but what really dropped the stars was that the left channel does not work on the output labelled CD\TAPE (it's barely audible. I've  tried panning full left, even panning, and full right. None of the combinations make the left channel more audible. (also tried new cables).<br /><br />Unfortunately, after buying all new cables trying to make sure it wasn't the mixer, i feel outside of my return period by 4 days, so i'm stuck with a product that doesn't work like it's supposed to :(

B006H3MIV8|5.0|Chimes of Freedom, The Songs of Bob Dylan 2 DISC SET (CD 2012)<br />  Like many \\"baby-boomers\\" (I hate that term, but...) with an in interest \\"folk music\\" (another meaningless term) I greatly admired Bob Dylan. While in high school I purchased his first two LP's \\"Freewheeling Bob Dylan\\" [1963] and \\"Bob Dylan\\" [1962]. The true epiphany came for me when in early 1964 I purchased \\"Times Are A- Changing\\" LP in Biloxi Ms during my military service. With Viet Nam ever so slowly ramping up and the looming battle over civil rights the songs on that album will always be etched into my mind.<br /><br />  Over the years my musical taste changed (matured, well...perhaps, perhaps not) and although I would pick up an occasional new Dylan cassette and later CD release my initial Dylan fever waned. Except, that is, for the curious incident when I listened to \\"Dylan and the Dead\\" and had an out of body experience.<br /><br />  I saw the \\"Chimes of Freedom\\" CD at the local Fivebucks (Starbucks) and the song selection and the artist doing the covers intrigued me. Snagged it on Ebay for 8 buckoos so even if it was a real bummer like the \\"30th Anniversary Concert Album\\" I had no cause to grouse.<br /><br />  Recently, driving alone - a good thing as it transpired - I slide CD-1 into the player. I will honestly say that with rare exception I was very, very impressed. During one song I had to wipe away a tear and during many others I was singing along. How good is that I thought! So that's it - two thumbs up, five stars you get the idea!<br /><br />  Wait a second you may say..that's not Dylan singing but some copy-cats! My take is that Dylan's ultimate legacy is not his singing but his lyrics and theams. So I am easy with a collection of non-Dylans doing his songs.

B000KIPT30|4.0|I owned a $100 Rolls headphone amp previously that lasted 10 years until it started cutting in and out on separate outputs. I replaced it with this one and haven't noticed much difference. You can really crank the volumes to deafening levels. The unit feels cheap compared to the Rolls model, but I don't plan on banging it around or being rough with it. The knobs are plastic and the casing feels aluminum. I didn't experience any noticeable sound degradation while using it.

0307887898|5.0|After being involved in some GB/BB and Kaizen projects, I found this book very refreshing on the entrepreneurial side. Many of us make the mistake of abandoning entrepreneurship when joining management of a large company, when in fact it is one of the most critical aspects with deep consequences for the success of the business. I like the author's recommendation of having a group of paid entrepreneurs, part of the overall organization, who focus on customer needs. As far as start-ups, while having a good perspectives primarily for start-up tech companies, I would recommend some of the Nolo books over this one - such as [[ASIN:1413310990 The Small Business Start-Up Kit: A Step-by-Step Legal Guide]].
1612130283|2.0|I read this book because, like many others, I saw it discussed on the Today Show. The S and M and Submissive/Dominant stuff captured the reader's attention at first but then became rather tedious. I think you would get as much information by \\"googling\\" the words.<br /><br />What's missing in the book is any depth. There is little character development and somethings are just silly--repeating \\"inner goddess\\" ad nauseum is too much. Also the emails all have different subjects. Not sure this really happens.<br /><br />The characters could be interesting but they are very shallow. The question--What really happened to Christian when he was a child?--is brought up but the reader is left hanging for a long time. Explaining this and giving the characters more depth MIGHT have helped this book. The sexual exploits became old. The conflict was there but things just kept going in circles.<br /><br />Interesting read for about the first third of the book.

B0067EKY7M|4.0|This one did snag me with a lure most appealing. Be forewarned that this 2012 romantic dramedy is idiosyncratic and full of whimsy, which should come as no surprise as the director is Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m whose most successful films ([[ASIN:B004SIP6BI Chocolat]], [[ASIN:B005DCJ1J6 The Cider House Rules]], [[ASIN:B000087EY5 My Life as a Dog]]) turn on flights of fancy. Besides, it's certainly not every romantic comedy that encompasses hydro-engineering, environmentalism, Middle East tensions, and British populism. What holds these disparate subjects together is the pipe dream one Yemeni sheikh has to bring salmon fishing to the wadis of his homeland. Adapted by Simon Beaufoy ([[ASIN:B001UEBHYS Slumdog Millionaire]]) from a popular [[ASIN:0156034565 2006 Brit-lit book]] by Paul Torday, the story primarily concerns the two people who get caught up in Sheikh Muhammad's dream - tweedy fisheries expert Dr. Alfred Jones, Fred to everyone who knows him, and super-efficient public relations consultant Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.<br /><br />They are enlisted by Patricia Maxwell, the hell-on-heels press officer for the British prime minister who is desperate for a feel-good distraction from the bloodshed occurring in Afghanistan. She is immediately drawn to the human interest angle of the salmon fishing story as well as the revelation that there are at least two million anglers in the U.K. Fred thinks the idea is ridiculous and for good reason - the plan is to build a dam (which looks as big as Hoover Dam), construct an elaborate irrigation system, and stock the waters with 10,000 North Atlantic salmon, all for the hefty price tag of fifty million pounds. Alas, Fred gradually succumbs to the deeply spiritual nature and ecological sensibilities of the sheikh's quest as well as Harriet's quiet persistence and demure charms. Complicating matters is the fact that Fred is unhappily married, while Harriet is getting serious with a handsome soldier who gets shipped to Afghanistan.<br /><br />Given the attractive leads, the romantic sparks are not surprising, but their cautious relationship and soulful connection provide much of the movie's unforced charm. The more fanciful events in the last half-hour do bring a level of incredulity for which Hallstr&ouml;m has become renowned, and the terrorist subplot is woefully underdeveloped relative to the love story. However, the actors in exchange deliver nicely turned performances with Ewan McGregor ([[ASIN:B0060M9T9U Beginners]]) at his most modestly suppressed as Fred. Usually cast in brittle or saucy roles, Emily Blunt ([[ASIN:B001C4AFOY The Young Victoria]]) brings unfettered charm to Harriet without sacrificing her steely intelligence. Kristin Scott Thomas ([[ASIN:B0064MT1QW The English Patient]]) easily steals all her scenes as Maxwell with acidic panache, while Amr Waked ([[ASIN:B000HF6XKO Syriana]]) brings a charismatic calm to the sheikh. Kudos should go to Terry Stacey ([[ASIN:B00715S5Z4 50/50]]) for his handsome cinematography which captures London, Morocco (subbing for Yemen), and especially Scotland in postcard-worthy tableaux./>Given the attractive leads, the romantic sparks are not surprising, but their cautious relationship and soulful connection provide much of the movie's unforced charm.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book. Steve went his own way. He would listen to others but he would stick to what he thought was the right way to do things ie: Apple stores. He was a national treasure and we as a nation lost a great mind with his premature death. Steve had a lot of good management skills such as designing an organization for collaboration and great values. Should be required reading for a lot of folks as you can learn alot about leadership and values.<br /><br />Steve was a difficult person at times but softened a little over the years.Sometimes forward thinkers have to be difficult. I recommend that folks look at Steve's 2005 commencement address at Stanford. It is on UTube. Steve may be the person of this century as he has impacted almost everyone.<br /><br />I stongly recommend this book

B002CIY8EM|1.0|This is not a book about astronomy. It is a shame that Amazon classifies it as such. There are probably some teenagers very interested in the real science and real world of astronomy who buy and read this book. I had a similar experience in my youth, picking up one of those Velikovsky books that are pure nonsense, because my library classified it as \\"astronomy\\". This, also, is pure nonsense. There is so much that is exciting, real and still to be learned about the world we live in. If you are really interested in astronomy (or just plain reality) don't waste your time with this trash. If you work for Amazon, please encourage them to remove this book from the category \\"science\\" and \\"astronomy\\".

B00005N6KG|5.0|I've owned a pair of these headphones ever since I got a set with a Sony Minidisc player. Yes, that long. They are without doubt the best headphones I've ever used with my myriad mobile devices down the years. I'm on my third set now, not because they break but because I lose them.<br /><br />The sound quality from these headphones is great - nice spectrum of sound from bass, through mid to the high frequencies. You do not need to wedge them in your ear canal to get that nice sound either, they can rest gently in your ear and you'll get the full frequency range.<br /><br />However the single best thing about these headphones is how comfortable they are. I have always found my ear aches terribly when using the in-ear type of headphones and they also fall out a lot. These headphones can be worn all day long and will not fall out of your ears. They are also very lightweight, so you can go jogging, ride a bike or simply walk along listening to them, without feeling like you've got some deadweight on your head.<br /><br />These headphones look flimsy, but they are anything but - that headband is unbelievably resiliant to twisting and stress - I've never had one fail on me.<br /><br />tl;dr - Awesome lightweight and robust headphones that you can wear all day long without earache.

Marissa Meyer did an amazing job of bringing the city of New Beijing and her characters to life. I thoroughly enjoyed Cinder from start to finish, and was finished with the book in one evening.<br /><br />There is so much I like about this book, I'm not even sure where to start. In hopes that I will not diminish another reader's experience in reading this book, I'm just going to say this book has it all: intrigue, murder, mystery, romance, plague, androids, robots, aliens, spaceships, characters you will love and characters you will love to hate! Need I even say more?<br /><br />From one Northwest girl to another, hats off to Ms. Meyer! I can't wait for the next installment of Cinder's story to arrive!

I cant even explain how much I liked it because I have no point of comparison. The music is awesome, The plot and characters are good and made great by spectacular acting and directing, and most importantly the feeling that builds through the movie will draw you in and keep your attention from the perfect intro to the engrossing conclusion. Basically this move is so original that it has to be seen no matter who you are.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked this book almost as much as the Hunger Games. It's hard to top the first book when the first book is so hugely successful. I don't think anyone who read the Hunger Games could NOT read this one. You get so caught up in the evolution of the characters in the first book you have to follow through. You won't be disappointed with this chapter of the games.

B007H7XJD4|1.0|Seriously!<br />Even though I am Greek myself, I can enjoy a greek-imspired, suspenseful and full-of-special-effects adventure/action film that is fun-to-watch, even if it rapes the entire mythology. For example, I enjoyed Troy, 300, even the Clash of the Titans (enough to want to watch the sequel). The key word here is FUN-TO-WATCH, which Immortals IS NOT!!! I cannot stress that enough!!!! The story HAD potential (providing you understood what was going on) and the movie WAS packed with action, so WHY WAS IT SO BAD?<br /><br />Well, for starters, the movie is extremely, unnecessarily dark. I don't mean that in a thematic, artistic, tim burton-sort-of way, but LITERALLY the black color on the screen. You spend more than two hours squinting, trying to figure out what is on the screen, desperately waiting for a frame that shows some sun in the surroundings. High-def only accentuated that. And it didnt seem to be because their photography director had a bad day. Instead, my guess was that it was part of an overly stylized take on the ancient world (OVERLY STYLIZED) which just made the movie painful (literally) to watch. No, not artistic or elegant (like 300 managed to do).<br /><br />Secondly, TOO MUCH BLOOD! And not in the obvious tarantino-splatter-sort-of-way, but just as a matter of fact, just because EVERY character in that movie (immortals and mortals alike) are unreasonably, unnecessary bloodthirsty. It's not even fun!! It strips the movie of all its righteous, emotional message of revenge and protecting the ones you love and so on and so forth. Instead, we are put through a tasteless extravaganza of killing (who kills who and exactly why is extremely difficult to understand -not to mention you can't see faces through the darkness).<br /><br />As I said, the movie had potential: I am sure all the characters had depth and stuff on paper. But the movie FAILS to communicate that! And that's fine, because, in the end, I was not expecting a life-changing eye-opening philosophical experience. But I did expect a nice mass-audience good-beats-evil adventure full of eye-candy graphics (it was released in 3D, too, for crying out loud). I DID expect to feel, you know, happy after I watched it. Instead, I was left with the image of people getting slaughtered, decapitated, burned alive etc. and for no apparent reason. I felt depressed at having wasted 2 hours and $6 to watch this. Even GODS (yeah, the olympian idea of human-centric yet almighty gods) have their motives mixed up. Nope. Too much trouble for a movie that offers NOTHING.<br /><br />Even if my analysis has not so far convinced you about how unworthy this movie is of your time, just trust me. Or trust my boyfriend who, after finishing this movie, exclaimed: \\"you know a movie was bad when, after it's done, you feel you would have had better time doing homework instead.\\"<br />Watch at your own peril.

B007H7XJD4|4.0|Key word here people is fantasy, some people get angry it doesn't follow so closely with Greek mythology as we know it, or that some cinematic scenes mimic 300. I ask what movie have we seen which is so original that you wont find the same cinematography elsewhere? I enjoyed the movie, it had great charterer development, eye-catching visuals, passion and the fight scenes where awesome.<br />A classic good vs. evil flick, that leaves room for more story to be told.

I would definitely recommend this for young adults (13+) and up!

B003O86FMW|4.0|While this sequel didn't have the raw shock of the first book, I found it quite gripping, with a slow to begin but steadily increasing immediacy that, once again, had me reading like mad for the last 40% of the book. I am ready to begin the next installment! I hesitate to say much about the story itself, though I found the bigger picture of the districts and the Capitol itself pretty interesting, and more than once I felt the influence of such great novels as 1984 and Oryx and Crake (two of my favorites, incidentally). It goes without saying that this book is recommended.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|If we owned Plants vs Zombies on the DS and PSP, that'd officially make it every platform.  As it is, we've got it on our mobile phones, my PS3, and the PC.  It is tremendous fun, but where the mobile version really shines is in its ability to use the touch screen.  Being able to now deploy two thumbs instead of one joystick, mouse, or stylus, makes playing the game much easier.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with Plants vs Zombies, the concept is simple.  The Zombies want to slowly make their way across your yard and eat your brains.  You like your brains, and you like your yard, so you put plants in your yard that can repel the zombie attacks.  Where it starts to get complicated is that there are different kinds of plants:  some produce \\"sunlight\\" (your money to buy things).  Others block, deter, and attack the zombies.  Each level runs on a timer and the zombies come in waves.  As you go further along, you get different waves--some at night, some on a roof--and you also get different kinds of gameplay.  When you beat the \\"campaign\\" mode, that's when the floodgates open and you now have a huge pile of minigames.  You also get the ability to pick any level and play it singly, without having to work your way up through the levels before it.<br /><br />If you've played Plants vs Zombies on a PC or console, then you know that one of the hazards is \\"losing your mouse\\".  You can't see the pointer in the midst of all the chaos, your eyes cross, and you miss some golden opportunity because you couldn't figure out where you were on the board.  The mobile version makes it much easier because there is no pointer: your fingers or thumbs tap where you want to, and you'll never forget where they are.  Even better, the occasional 'loot drops' (coins, gems, etc.) that you would sometimes not have the time to get to, you simply scoop up with a tap from the other hand.  I often play with both thumbs poised over the screen.<br /><br />If you've played Plants vs Zombies and want to take it with you, you won't be disappointed with the way it hits the small screen.  If you're new to Plants vs Zombies, get ready for some zany, cartoon-horror-movie fun.o take it with you, you won't be disappointed with the way it hits the small screen.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|While Angry Birds is a tremendously fun game, I couldn't stand the ad version of Angry Birds any more.  Not only would the ads slow (or even freeze) the game, they'd constantly drop into the screen, resulting in missed shots and annoying blinking nonsense.  Worse, the ad content is irrelevant, so I'd occasionally get some very inappropriate ads dumped in front of my daughter's face while she was playing on my phone.<br /><br />Angry Birds (Ad-Free) is \\"Ad-free\\" in the sense that there are no drop-in banner ads during the course of playing the game.  The ads will show when you're in between the game levels, paused or at menus.  While that's not really \\"ad-free\\", the ads all appear to be about Angry Birds merchandise, so I'm glad to be rid of the garbage.  They also do not appear to slow my phone, nor do they blink obnoxiously like the ad-loaded version's banners do.<br /><br />If you're new to Angry Birds, the idea is simple:  you use a slingshot to fling birds at flimsy structures filled with little piggies that just sit there waiting to be knocked over.  You have to knock over all the piggies to complete the level.  You use your finger to pull back and release the slingshot, and the birds crash into the structures and cause tons of damage.<br /><br />What makes Angry Birds fun is both the hilarious cartoon sounds and the chaotic use of physics.  Glass shatters, rock doesn't, and wood can be stubborn.  Knock over one part of a structure and watch the rest of it sway, teeter, and possibly collapse along with it.  The fun gets better as the levels go on, getting more and more intricate.<br /><br />This is the original Angry Birds game.  It was followed by Angry Birds Seasons and Angry Birds Rio (both of which are available in ad-loaded and ad-free versions).  Angry Birds Seasons is special because it is on year two of continuous updates to the game:  added levels themed after the holidays of 2011 and now 2012.  It is also harder to play than Angry Birds, so if you haven't played the original, you might want to start here.  Angry Birds Rio is slightly more complicated than Angry Birds, and is based on the BlueSky Animation animated movie \\"Rio\\".<br /><br />The \\"Ad-Free\\" version may not be 100% Ad-Free, but at the price, it's definitely money well spent.en't played the original, you might want to start here.

B004SBX112|5.0|While Angry Birds Seasons is a tremendously fun game, I couldn't stand the ad version of Angry Birds any more.  Not only would the ads slow (or even freeze) the game, they'd constantly drop into the screen, resulting in missed shots and annoying blinking nonsense.  Worse, the ad content is irrelevant, so I'd occasionally get some very inappropriate ads dumped in front of my daughter's face while she was playing on my phone.<br /><br />Angry Birds Seasons (Ad-Free) is \\"Ad-free\\" in the sense that there are no drop-in banner ads during the course of playing the game.  The ads will show when you're in between the game levels, paused or at menus.  While that's not really \\"ad-free\\", the ads all appear to be about Angry Birds merchandise, so I'm glad to be rid of the garbage.  They also do not appear to slow my phone, nor do they blink obnoxiously like the ad-loaded version's banners do.<br /><br />If you're new to Angry Birds, the idea is simple:  you use a slingshot to fling birds at flimsy structures filled with little piggies that just sit there waiting to be knocked over.  You have to knock over all the piggies to complete the level.  You use your finger to pull back and release the slingshot, and the birds crash into the structures and cause tons of damage.<br /><br />What makes Angry Birds fun is both the hilarious cartoon sounds and the chaotic use of physics.  Glass shatters, rock doesn't, and wood can be stubborn.  Knock over one part of a structure and watch the rest of it sway, teeter, and possibly collapse along with it.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|Beautiful Creatures was one of my favorite books I had ever read and the sequel, Beautiful Darkness was just as amazing.

1401923127|4.0|In a very readable, partially autobiographical style, Bruce Lipton describes his eureka moment.He suddenly realized that a cell's life is mainly controlled by the environment, and only partially by it's genes, and most importantly what this means for each one of us. It's a single cell's awareness of it's environment that sets in motion the mechanisms of life. And we have trillions of these intelligent aware cells in our bodies. Lipton calls this not a self help book, but a self empowerment book. As a stem cell biologist he is well qualified to explain how cells work and why changing your beliefs can actually change your biology. The science of how our cells function is made clear with interesting explanations.Learn how environmental influences can modify genes and how these changes can be passed on.We do not have to accept the fate of genetic determination.The chapter on conscious parenting is a must read for those raising or working with children
B000SEFDP0|5.0|This is a collection of what I believe are the best reviews on this book:<br /><br />One reviewer said \\"This is a book I SHOULD have read, back then when it was new.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds has always been my favorite game, and it still is. Works great on kindle fire. Golden eggs are still in the game, too!
B003MC5N28|4.0|While I know that many elements of this story would be impossible to duplicate in real life, it does make one think about what life could be like if the government overstepped its boundaries.<br /><br />It was a very good story and I had no trouble staying interested.  It's just leaving me more thoughtful and melancholy than I thought it would.  The thought of the government controlling lives to that extreme is pretty disturbing.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|other reviews say that this game had been fixed and everything is fine well I'm here to tell you I wasted my money on this stupid app because it wont download on my kindle fire do not by this app if I could give it zero stars I would its a total waste!
B004RKXNDU|1.0|Was excited to finally be able to read this book for which I was wait-listed on my library's Kindle program.  Found out I could not download it (as with other Kindle books) because the publisher would allow only USB transmission. This was irritating before I even began to read the book. Usually purchase my Kindle books but this one was over-priced for an \\"old\\" book.  Happy I did not spend the money as I agree with the 80% of book club participants who found the British jargon difficult to follow, the characters confusing and the cold war era spy concepts not relevant in today's society.  Reading is relaxing for me; this book was torture and I will not finish it but return it so another reader may explore its idiosyncracies.  It may be a masterpiece but it passed me by.

A baby crying and attracting zombies with all the noise?? Really???

1466401885|5.0|First off, I really didn't want to like this book because it was so disfunctional... but I absolutely LOVED it. It has a bit of truth to it. People the age of Trav and Abby tend to play games and beat around the bush a lot. You are always waiting for something crazy to happen while reading this, and it definitely delivers. The characters are well developed. Travis is HOT and extreme when it comes to almost everything. America, Abby's best friend, is also a character I liked. She's so loyal to Abby that it made me happy to read their interactions. That's what a best friend should be like. This book is definitely dramatic, but it will always be a guilty pleasure of mine. I have already re-read, and I'm sure I will re-read it again!

B004QSQML8|5.0|Very happy with this product as it has the score by Tangerine Dream, which was the only version that I had seen and enjoyed on video, many years ago.  I had initially purchased the recently released European version of the film but didn't realise that this contained the original Jerry Goldsmith orchestral score, which, when I listened to it, didn't give the film the same enjoyment factor.  Also pleased that the 'Ultimate Edition' is Region Free, so no hassles playing back on my Region 2 device.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|In early October, 2011, Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" was performed live at the Royal Albert Hall in London and broadcast live to theaters around the world. There were three performances: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Sunday's was widely considered the best, as the earlier performances suffered from various glitches and flaws. This DVD appears to be Sunday's performance--but it's been edited so that the few flaws that existed are minimized. Consider it the best of the best!<br /><br />The one element that bugged me the most is now gone. When Christine takes her bow at the end of \\"Think of Me\\" the cameras turn around and project a view of the audience onto the backdrops, so that Christine appears to have a real audience to bow to. On Sunday's performance, an usher was seating someone right at that moment. Bad timing! Guests in obviously modern clothing could be seen, pulling the viewers out of the moment. But in the DVD, that scene was replaced with a different version, where there are no ushers in sight and everyone is seated and applauding for Christine. Much better! The other edits were subtle and hard to spot, but it made for a smoother overall production.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\", the story is classic: a love triangle between The Phantom, Christine, and Raoul. The Phantom has secretly been teaching Christine to sing. In the process, he falls in love with her. When she achieves success, she catches the eye of Raoul, her childhood sweetheart. The two become involved, much to the Phantom's dismay. In some versions, it's clear that Christine loves Raoul wholeheartedly and wants nothing to do with the Phantom. But in this version, Christine appears to be torn. I won't spoil the ending, but suffice to say, I haven't seen the show yet where I didn't cry at the end.<br /><br />The music is spectacular and moving. The sets are minimal, but effective. The costumes are gorgeous! And the actors were well-chosen. Ramin Karimloo is the best Phantom I've ever seen. He and Sierra Boggess have fantastic chemistry! And they should, for it's not their first time in the roles. Ramin played the Phantom in London, and Sierra played Christine in Las Vegas. They also played the Phantom and Christine together in the sequel, \\"Love Never Dies\\". Their voices are superb. Hadley Fraser was perfect as Raoul, too. Boyish and innocent, yet strong and protective of Christine.<br /><br />Nothing can beat watching the show live. But this DVD is the next best thing.in Karimloo is the best Phantom I've ever seen.

I think i love it more than Twilight, but don't tell anyone that haha. The Hunger Games is chalked full of emotion and beautiful story line, the events that take place are so imaginative and perfect for the situation. I couldn't find a single thing wrong with this novel and i wouldn't add or change a single thing. Beautifully done, Suzanne Collins. I cannot wait to finish this series and see the movie.

0071636080|1.0|This was required reading for one of the classes I'm taking this semester and I must say that this book felt more like a biography than an actual how-to. Most of the facts presented are stuff that we already know about Steve Jobs. Besides, I hated how this book praised Jobs as if he were some king or something... eh.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|All the suspense of the first book in this second series, with Percy disappearing and Jason coming out of nowhere, is twisted with this second book where Percy reappears, without his full memories, now in the Roman gods fashion. Aside from the typical long-winded mission and cataclysmic battles, what is interesting is the way the Greek previous story-line sometimes is recounted from a Roman point-of-view, and as the internal tensions arise between the cultures, to build up-and-up as both worlds will have to meet in the next book to overcome the wrath of Gaia, which is awakening to destroy gods and mortals.<br /><br />Some other characters from the first series reappear like Nico Di Angelo, as the son of Pluto now, which doesn't help Percy much about his memory loss, at least. Also some unfriendly ones come back, but I don't want to spoil the fun, suffice to say that Percy has the odds always piling-up AGAINST him and his friends, and Riordan masterfully leads the story to a wonderful partial conclusion, as this is not the end of it...

B0067QPVD2|4.0|Director John Carpenter of 1982's The Thing should be proud. The 2011 version of The Thing is a prequel to Carpenter's version, and 2011 Thing Director Matthijs van Heijningen (who???) pays tribute to Carpenter's work by creating the Arctic Norwegian Camp story that immediately precedes the events in Carpenter's film.<br /><br />Carpenter's The Thing is one of my all time favorites and has several moments that are just stuck on my brain. Who will ever forget the dog metamorphosis, the blood jumping out of the petri dish or especially \\"the head-spider\\"? And what about the burned up, half metamorphed creature that Kurt Russell and his crew find at the Norwegian camp...well, you do indeed find out the origin of that \\"Thing\\" in the 2011 film and it is done brilliantly.<br /><br />So the 2011 film takes place in 1982 hours before the 1982 film begins. The Thing 2011 basically is somewhat of a Norwegian Camp redo of the same kinds of horrors that befell Kurt Russell's American Camp. But like I said earlier it was all very well done. The Norwegians find the spaceship and \\"the escape pod\\" encased in ice, they let it melt, the beast is unleashed and, voil&agrave;, it's d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again in reverse.<br /><br />The cast of The Thing 2011 is mostly as little known as the Director with the exception of Mary Elizabeth Winstead. But they all do a great job making you feel like you're right there in the cold, Arctic camp with them in a real situation. There's tons of action & thrills and I was completely entertained from start to finish.<br /><br />Now if you've never seen Carpenter's 1982 version, it's completely unnecessary to see it in advance of the 2011 version. In fact my son had never seen Carpenter's, and after showing him the 1982 version after we had watched the 2011 version he asked, \\"Why would I want to watch the second part of the story first?\\" So if you're new to The Thing franchise go ahead and grab this film as a warm up to [[ASIN:B001CW7ZWG one of the best sic-fi horror flicks of the past 30 years]]. And if you're a fan of Carpenter's The Thing, but you're concerned that this movie will be a blasphemous injustice to a classic, you'd be depriving yourself of what is a very cool upfront to one of our favorite movies.horror flicks of the past 30 years]].

145162445X|1.0|Part of me is surprised at reading some of the glowing reviews of this book, and yet another part of me is not surprised. I'm reminded of G. K. Chesterton's statement \\"The danger of not believing in God is not that a person believes in nothing; instead the danger is that they'll believe in anything!\\"<br /><br />Does no one seem to be bothered that Krauss' entire argument is based on his redefinition of \\"nothing\\"? \\"Nothing\\" is \\"no thing\\", which means it's not empty space, and certainly not the quantum vacuum. No, these are \\"things\\" and not \\"nothing\\". But not to Krauss who wants to revise nothing's definition.<br /><br />Like Aristotle said, \\"Nothing is what rocks dream about.\\" With that true definition applied to Krauss' book, his work collapses into an incoherent diatribe. It is the perfect example of what in philosophy is called \\"drowning the fish\\". You can pour all the water you want on the animal, but in the end it will still be there affirming its existence. Krauss accomplishes absolutely \\"nothing\\" in his attempt to deny that God created the Heavens and the Earth.

B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I loved watching the Game of Thrones on HBO.  I think it is a great series, excellent production values, and great acting. Definitely worth a watch, especially on a format where you can instantly re-watch an episode.  A lot of the inner plot points (and character names) are hard to figure out on first watch.  The menu navigation is HORRIBLE.  First, why would you need 5 discs for 10 hours of show?  Even with another 10 hours of extra features (which there isn't) you wouldn't need 5 discs..the startup time takes forever.  No wonder people find alternative ways to watch things.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|Sometimes Director's Cuts of the movies are just adding scenes that should have stayed on the cutting floor. Not the case with the Green Lantern Director's Cut, the scenes, specially the flashbacks to Hal Jordan's childhood are very pertinent to enjoy the story even more.<br /><br />This is a movie that at first look didn't meet with my approval, but I loved the character so much that I decided to give it a second chance in bluray and it was so much better. In fact, it became one of my favorites of the year. Don't miss it.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|This dvd is a necessity for any Phantom Fan. It has harnessed all of the power and exhilaration of a live show and the cast is absolutely superb. The cast is in my opinion the best Phantom cast ever, and for all of you traditionalists, you will be happy to see that Micheal and Sarah make a surprise appearance at the end of the show. It is very worth the money if you've ever seen phantom and want to take it home with you or even if you never have before because that's what this is for.

This is a 'feel good' movie to it's roots, the music had me tapping foot in time with the beat, and the 'all over the place' plot added to the fun.<br /><br />I don't understand the folks who gave this movie one star. Someone must have organized a 'hate in'.<br /><br />I call this movie 'great fun for kids of all ages'!
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham does not disappoint in his new book.  The pace is steady, the book is timely and interesting and the writing is up there with the best.

I expecially love the soccer and basketball board because my daughter plays both those sports. The music was annoying, so I turned that off right away. The sound effects were fun. Minus 2 stars for internet permissions. Unsure why the developer needs this since there's no online aspect to this game at all. Developers need to limit permissions to ONLY what is necessary, or at least explain why various permissions are needed.
B0065GG2ZK|5.0|Great album I recommend to any one who like Lil Wayne, or any of drakes previous music.<br />This album uses a lot of hidden samples as I like to call them.<br />Mainly from the 90's, from artist like juvenile and Jon b and more.<br />You are in for a treat with this album. I find my self still reaching for it months later.<br />There is a longevity to it that reinvents a past era of music.
1612130283|4.0|This book has exploded in the media recently. Apparently, it is a real big hit among women. Why wouldn't it be? With a hot, brooding protagonist and kinky sex? It's like a chocolate bar in book form. Love Line's Doctor Drew even spoke about it, none too kindly, on his show.<br /><br />Why wouldn't I want to read this? It's got all this buzz around it. The biggest reason I started it was for the buzz, the biggest reason I set it down was because I found out it started life as a Twilight fan-fiction. The similarities are there, bold as day. Character's names are changed, descriptions are different, occupations are switched around. Kudos to the editorial staff for that!<br /><br />It isn't written fantastically. Things will move from the mundane into large words that seem out of place. Though that makes a little more sense, considering that the author is British.<br /><br />As for the erotica, I expected there to be more, shall I say, interesting, scenes. There is one scene with metal balls, a bit of spanking (though not even as much as in Outlander), tampon ripping out, but only one scene that really made it remotely close to the Dom/Sub kinkiness that the book promised.<br /><br />Overall, the book is fun. I wouldn't call it serious reading, but it's perfect form for erotic fluff and utter silliness and it kept me entertained. The ending caught me off guard and caused me to jump immediately into the second book. I would have probably rated this book three stars if it just wasn't so silly. It's not trying to be something it's not, and that, in and of itself, is refreshing.

B000025L6U|5.0|service was supper fast and the merchandise in excellent conditions, just as described on the link. I usually buys used things and have never ever been disappointed. Undertow is the best album ever by Tool, the songs are amazing and deep, not suitable for everyone!
B004N0PZNK|5.0|Biology of Belief speaks of some of the most important discoveries of our time.  The implications of these discoveries can literally be life transforming. Bruce Lipton is a genius.
B001AQO3XS|5.0|This is an awesome movie, even thought special effects were not quite high tech as they are today.  I didn't pay as much as I would have if I purchased it in a retail shop.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This will be a short review, because there is not much to say. Settlers of Catan is quite literally one of the greatest games of all time. It is fun, and fairly simple, yet at the same time takes strategy and thought. I highly recommend this game for EVERYONE! And if you don't already have it check out the expansion: [[ASIN:B000W7JWYG The Settlers of Catan 5 and 6 Player Extension]]
0545425115|4.0|Wow. So I took the plunge and decided to finally hop on board the hunger games bandwagon, and I am absolutely thrilled that I did!<br />One of my daughters friends told me that this book was like twilight, a huge favorite of hers but something I have no interest in. I cant believe I took his word for it.<br />The story is complex and riveting, it does a spectacular job of sucking the reader in and refusing to let them go. Even though it seems to be pegged at a younger audience, I enjoyed it wildly. I will probably let me daughter read it in a few years, but i think it goes without saying that this is a \\"young adult\\" book not a young child one.<br />The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the writing style struck me as a tad unsophisticated. Other than that though I recommend this book without any hesitation!!
B0045XKJBI|5.0|My granddaughter absolutely loves the Twilight series; I had to watch the movie when I got it to catch up on what they're all talking about!  Thank You!
0060776579|3.0|It is not the best book i read, but its ok to listen while driving. Much better than listening to music, or radio because here you can learn something. Especially try to be better at your own characteristics.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I am an avid Harry Potter fan and have a varied collection of H.P. memorabilia!  Even bought a small building to organize it in...  This movie is the final touch to my collection!  Love It!  Thank You!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The 8 discs cover years 1-7 at Hogwarts. They are just copies of the orginal films. So if you have seen the films you will find the same on the dvds. The recordings are very good quality I did not find a flaw in any of the discs. All of the discs  are in english or spanish and some of them are also in french. It was a very good buy for the money.
B005ONTD42|2.0|After about two minutes playing with this device I had to ask myself two questions:  Is this really all this thing does?  What was I thinking when I bought it?  Sphero now has a special place in my junk closet.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|Even after listening to the four disks there were so many others that could have been included, but the selection as it stands is excellent. Some true rare pieces of brilliance that is founded on Dylan's genius. Some disappointments especially with Sting. All in all an excellent addition to the many compilation CDs out there.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Lee Child and Jack Reacher, great combo....Keep writing, the stories are fun and never get old....This one fills in a lot of missing pieces and questions....
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is one of the most useful apps I've downloaded. The ability to create different types of notes (audio text picture etc) quickly and easily and have them synced with all my devices is extremely convenient.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I have used these with my iPad 2 and they are quite handy! Actually, I've only really used the SD card adapter, because both my digital cameras (Canon PowerShot and Canon Vixia) use SD cards, so I just remove those from the cameras and use the Apple SD card adapter instead of connecting the cameras by a USB cord. I did try once to use a USB memory stick with the Apple USB adapter, but it would not work. I really wish Apple would provide that capability. Also, of course video files like AVCHD are not going to download to your ipad because they're not compatible, but I already knew that and was not expecting to be able to do that. But all the photos have downloaded without a hitch, and the low quality videos from my old Canon PowerShot A520 will also download. The design and construction seem durable and well-made, just what I expect from Apple.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|This movie is fantastic, little hard to get and is expensive used but well worth it. It's a great classic and always will be.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|I had been looking for a weather app that supported radar, and I'm happy the update came. I cant really find anything wroung with it. After trying almost 6 weather apps, this one is definatly the best.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|...like it. I like it alot!!! But it is too hard to pass level 29.  anybody know of any cheats for kindle?
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first few chapters may seem a little slow, but press on and keep reading, you won't regret it. After finishing this book I had to instantly download \\"Mocking Jay\\". Love, love, love the entire series.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This was one of the first apps I downloaded to my kindle fire. I thought I'd try the free version since I've heard so much about the game. I am telling you: It's a fun and highly addictive game. My husband and I are almost \\"fighting\\" about who will complete the next level. Have fun!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy this game when I'm out and I have spare time on my hands and need something fun to do,besides have sex...I do believe having sex in public is frowned upon.
159562015X|5.0|Excellent resource book to help understand staff and very spot on with personalities and strengths.  Highly recommend this tool.  Everyone enjoyed learning of their strengths instead of weaknesses!!  Great way to look at ourselves.
B0031RS2HC|3.0|Over all this is an OK read, but I've read other Lee Child books that were far superior. The circumstances of this book are so implausible that it made it hard to enjoy completely. It does move quickly and the individual characters are enjoyable but the whole thing just didn't hang together for me.
142312166X|5.0|great book goted before i was supose to . in exelent conditions. would recomend the vender to more peopleif they ask.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is a great way to stay entertained. You can play for hours yourself or let the kids play while your sitting in a waiting room or while your out running errands. Its wonderful.
0689865384|5.0|This was such a great book. I read it when i was in fourth grade and loved it. Some people said i would not be able to underatnd it but I am a great reader and this book got me hooked onto other books like it. At only a few parts I thought it was boring but the rest made up for it. Everyone should read this.<br />For Scott Westerfeld<br />You are such a talented writer. I love your work. The only thing is I disagree with the book Extras. That was not the best idea for a book. You should either add on to that book or not have made it. Not the best idea on your part.
1401937519|2.0|In the nineteen nineties, I read a book with such identical sentences that I wondered about plagiarism. (Embraced by the Light, Betty J. Eadie).  However, the father of lies is not creative and sends similar delusions to many people.<br /><br /> Moorjani, of Indian and Hindi heritage, grew up in Hong Kong, influenced by Chinese culture. She attended British schools and is multi-lingual and multi-cultural. When she developed cancer, she sought healing from many sources. Dying, she experienced a near-death event and decided to live again.<br /><br /> From such near-death events, a three-fold tragedy can result. What people feel is so dramatic and powerful, they totally lack interest in evaluating whether they truly know whose love they felt. Secondly, as Moorjani did, they may develop a philosophy that convinces others to follow them. Thirdly, when these people finally discover deep-down, honest truth about that source of love, it can be forever too late.<br /><br /> Moorjani's philosophy centers on `fully loving yourself'. She believes if everyone did, we'd have a perfect world. She no longer believes in right and wrong or judgment against anyone, even the worst criminals. She says lawbreakers problem is not loving themselves enough.<br /><br /> These near-death experiences offer glimpses of truth, ie, eternity is a state of timelessness where indescribable love exists. Not discovering the real name of the being who sends that love is where those like Moorjani go astray. Thus, these people become locked into delusions. So, so, so tragically sad.<br /><br />Reviewed by Geni White, Former Licensed professional Psychiatric RN

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am fond of change and I am proud to own the most current version of the films.<br />The picture and sound are phenominal, the best I can imagine. Haters get hosed.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Bought the Harry Potter set at Christmas for my 8-year old grandson, who hadn't read any of the books.  He and his Dad watched the films and loved them.  Our next stop will be the Harry Potter park at Universal/Orlando.  Great gift!
B00475BUVM|2.0|I bought the 3D version of this movie about a month ago and I had been saving it for the right moment to watch it.  I had already seen the 2D version and thought it was an okay movie... not the best, but entertaining.  After watching other movies on the same level, I realized that 3D makes some movies more enjoyable.  Not this one.  For the first half of the movie the 3D didn't even seem to be working.  There was a couple times when I thought about placing the 2D disc in and finishing the movie that way because the 3D version wasn't worth wearing the glasses for 2 hours.  So far, this is the worst 3D movie that I've seen.  It didn't help that I had just watched Immortals right before it which was much better in 3D.  I really didn't like that film in 2D and though 3D didn't make the story better, it was a visually stunning work of art that I couldn't turn off.  Anyways, stay away from this one.  Luckily I bought mine on sale and it included the Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|As a college student I take a lot of notes. Evernote gives me the ability to take notes in class and use my computer to make the into powerpoints and slides later.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Well-written, as are most Stephen King's novels, but too long. Subject matter-the \\"butterfly effect\\" of time travel- done before. Again, Mr. King's writing ability carried the book & made it an enjoyable read.
B002BWP49C|5.0|i had excellent service,speed,and great copy. Will definitely use them again in the future for other movie choices.thanks for a positive buy. I don't always get that from other on-line sites.
0307346617|4.0|It's essentially a collection of short stories (with some stories connected to others) documenting (chronologically) the rise of the zombie apocalypse and how various countries or people responsed to the rise. The chapter/interview structure makes this book very easy to read as the short chapters allow you to stop reading whenever you'd like to while also allowing you to quickly knock out just one more chapter. Some chapters are slower than others, with a few that are simply fantastic and exciting. Though I felt the book seemed to drag on a bit at the end, I found the story to be a fun and creative read.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love being able to read books on my Galaxy Nexus, but I would guess that I have 30+ books downloaded. Would be really nice to be able to create folders to sort my books. I do not have a tablet, nor do I plan to get one, as my phone does everything I need.
0452273331|4.0|This is an excellent tale about a man who refuses to compromise his own professional beliefs despite the sheep of society telling him otherwise. There are a few other sub-main characters that are enjoyable to follow as well, including someone who just wants to have a societal significance, even if his impact is negative, and someone else who seems to refuse to follow his heart and make decisions he knows is right simply because he feels he has to follow some expected path (and watching his actions range from depressing to infuriating).<br /><br />This book is very entertaining and keeps you turning pages wanting to find out what happens next. It's a relatively long novel, but it doesn't feel that long as it keeps you engaged and prevents you from just wanting the book to be over.<br /><br />However, if you've read Atlas Shrugged, you can get by without reading this book, as it's basically a very simplified version of Atlas Shrugged in nearly every respect. There are fewer characters, the characters aren't as complex, the writing isn't as complex (however, that means it's a much easier read), the subplots are fewer, the background tangents are fewer and shorter, and the book is significantly shorter. For as much more complicated Fountainhead is than Anthem, Atlas Shrugged is just as more complicated, if not more, than Fountainhead. If you are deciding between this and Atlas Shrugged, I personally enjoyed Atlas Shrugged much more; however, I have a number of friends who enjoyed Fountainhead more - and the one common theme I found amongst people who prefer one over the other is that they always enjoy the one they read first more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is an awesome app!!  what else is there to say, it is great, love the part where it reads to you!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I hate this app. Does not give a clear explination of the games played AT ALL. This is a truly crappy app. (And I don't say that often.)
B000FC0OOU|5.0|Hemingway is always worth reading again. This novel of the Spanish civil war is a benchmark work, rated as perhaps his best and one of the finest war novels ever written. It is used as a teaching text in universities. That said, For whom The Bell Tolls is a ripping yarn, faultlessly shaped, fast paced, with characters who live in the reader's memory. The prime protagonist gets killed off . . . but that's war. Hemingway never ducked.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game all the time, I've won 541 games without losing. This is the most I've ever completed.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|This is a MUST have for any Jared Leto lover! This movie is incredible, and Jared is not only a talented musician he is an amazing actor that plays about 8 different people! This movie is worth every penny and such a shame it wasn't released in the US! Mr. Nobody is my favorite Jared movie hands down!
B000I3UAJ0|4.0|I love that movies are so easy to rent via Amazon. Although, the streaming kept stopping and reloading. The movie was interupted several times and reloading took several minutes. Granted, this could have been a connection problem on my end, but I was streaming Netflix and on the internet doing other stuff before and afternoon and didnt have any issues. If they get the kinks worked out, it'll be great!
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Joe is loaded with talent. The DVD looks and sounds great. Has a great group of musicians playing with him.
B004LSO6YI|4.0|Great movie and for once a lesbian movie with a plot and sexy scenes. Well done by the director and of course the actors.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|WOW!!!!!! This is the best book i have EVER read!!!!After starting the hunger games i was completely sucked in. Susanne Collins has an amazing way with words that made it seem like Katniss and Peeta were my friends!!!The basic outline of the book is that every year in the world of Panem 24 teens are put into an arena and will be forced to fight to the death! i enjoyed the story very much and be prepared to buy the second one because it is a CLIFHANGER!!!!!!<br />I spent at least 75% of the book in tears because it is such a sweet and touching story. I consider this book a romantic love story caught up in tragic war zone! I would recommend this book for a mature audience ( about 12+), there are some gory parts and kissing but mainly all clean with no swearing. i give this a 110 out of 100!!! i would not change one thing. though people may say it is scary i am a girl when screams when people sneeze and i didnt think it is scary at all. over all i think it has many good points and made me think. if i could, i would have everyone read it and see how fortunate we are.
B006N38104|4.0|SEal has done it again. Awesome songs sung by an awesome vocalist. My favorite is Wishing on a Star. Brings me back to youth.
0760335540|5.0|I have a 996 C2 2002 but since a lot of things are the same/similar on the Boxster and the 996 the book is really good also for Carrera owners. Lots of interesting and useful information and pictures when working on the car. I have just made a clutch replacement on my 996 and this book was really neat. Highly recommended! I just wish he could write a book directly for the 996, but in the meantime, this book is good enough!<br /><br />Robert
B0076NKLRQ|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie. I pre-bought it thinking I would be moved by a different story other than the difficult, pill-induced Marilyn that I've seen portrayed. While Williams does give a strong performance of the electric and spell-binding Monroe, I found the film overall, predictable and two dimensional. I believe there was a lot more to M.M than this film portrayed- painful, desirous, and strong. However, I felt the story caricaturized M.M. to a point that she was a cardboard cutout, once again, used for other peoples' delight. This is unfortunate. I was expecting a more complicated illustration... Not some weak, diluted representation of someone's ill-assumed diary. No doubt do I believe this is a true story from the perception of the author- but I think it's a very superficial understanding, unless Miss Monroe, of course, was a pretentious, privileged one dimensional individual. Not my favorite, and now I'm regretting buying the movie. Unfortunately, this movie and its renderings, fell flat.
1574216988|5.0|Yoga for Your Brain is a super workout to exercise your brain.  The older I get the more I realize I have to exercise my mind.  Just looking at the pictures makes me think of what I can zentangle. I have taken zentangling to a whole new level incorporating it in my paint projects. Once you are hooked on zentangling, you automatically get others interested in zentangling.  Living in a 55+ community, zentangling has helped handicapeed artists unable to get out all those paint supplies. All they need is a pad and pencil. I am even zentangling with my 8 year old grandaugher.....awesome!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|i relly enjoyed this book. it was fast and had a good plot. the main flaw was that the style annoyed me but thats just me. i have to disagree with some people who said that this book had no morals. i think that she wrote this book like she were an observer somtimes. a lot of the characters are immoral but the book itself is not. she leaves that part up to us.
B007JF87VS|3.0|so why doesn't any other network please pick up a zombie series and not some crap comic that turns into a crap show followed by and even crappier second season, recipe for an awesome zombie series no one lives forever group always changing, mix up flash backs to actual zombie apocalypse start up not a traffic jam, it's the end of the got dang world stop acting like a bunch of drama queens.<br /><br />Stop with the soap opera, stop the crap writing, daryl is the only character you got, Rick looks like he's always cuttin onions, shane's always lookin to off something, andrea like a coin, the chick with the buzzard head needs to die... daughter lost she cooks wtf useless, tdog useless off him bring back morgan and dwayne, get some consistency (example whole episode first season a bought walkers smelling then first episode second season they walk within a foot of them an nothing + many more, maybe for once the fact that this is at least an infection spread through fluid transfer yet everyone get splattered in the face with zombie gore left and right..... it's just sad and I wouldn't watch it at all if there was any other network putting out an origin zombie series with decent actors, good writers (important since well the zombie apocalypse gets tedious without it), good effects bout the only thing this show does is cool zombies, and not so much dang whining and drama oiy there's frigging work to do stop having sissy fits
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it.  I play all the time.  But there are s lot of ads but they don't. bother me.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This set is a wonderful reminder of a classic movie.  Beautifully done and lots of extras.  A must have for any Sound of Music fan.
1849514003|4.0|This book is filled with code examples on how to do various things with Cocos2d.  There are lots of different things covered and the author has a project available to see everything in action.  The time you save makes it well worth the cost.<br /><br />I admit the explanations are a little on the short side, but this is a cookbook after all, so I can't fault it for that.  On the other hand, you should be prepared for that if you intend to purchase it.<br /><br />If you are new to Cocos2d, you're better off with \\"Learning Cocos2d\\" by Wenderlich as it`s meant for beginners to Cocos2d.
B00499K9E0|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've watched in a long time.  The two lead actors are amazing (and they're Bilbo and Smaug in the upcoming Hobbit films),  the script is very well written, Cumberbatch does a masterful job of bringing Sherlock holmes to life.  There's never a dull moment on Baker Street!  Wonderful work.  I have two new favorite actors.  Can't wait for future episodes.
B002N44XSG|4.0|i loved htis book it had great xtra info. the interveiws of the charaters where perfect. the short syories i devoured in minutes. It also showed a little xtra info on annbeth.a must read but try to read in between fourth p.j book an fifth.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I don't see what all the hype was about. The first half was pretty good but then it just started repeating and dragging along. I think I will pass on the other two books in this series.
B0000025WR|5.0|this is a grate cassette to listen to. takes me back to high school to my first slow dance. price was right.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|This is a must have. It is mellow and perfect for the season with great classics. Highly recommend for the holiday season.
B005LJITS0|1.0|I never got it!!!!!  Please check into that!! I am so glad u reminded me!<br />So where is it?? Since I have to put more words in, I'll tell u of my disappointment<br />And the review come now in March?
B000023VR6|4.0|if you are going to buy 2001 get the instrumental because the beats are great but the lyrics suck. its all about money, girls and sex, get 2001 intrumental and the chronic and call it a day!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Each episode provides a breathtaking glimpse of life in remote areas of our world, from snow leopards in the mountains of Asia to piranhas feeding in South America to lions hunting elephants in Africa.  This series displays both the fragility and the resilience of creation and the interdependence of lifeforms.  I enjoyed the behind-the-scenes looks at the end of each episode, which detail the perseverance required of those filming the wildlife.  I highly recommend this series both for science education and for personal enjoyment.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love this game!!! Works well with my old Vibrant.  Too bad there wasnt any extra side games to compliment it.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|Overall this movie was captivating from start to finish.  Michelle Williams became Marilyn and made me a believer from the start!  This movie was missed as a best actress and best picture of the year by the academy...this is one that I will buy an offline copy and keep an enjoy for years to come.<br /><br />A+++ this is the way movies used to be created!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in the last 5 years - Recommending to all of my friends!
0802136834|5.0|Weir captures the imagination and succeeds in fleshing out historical characters to an amazing depth through her research. Love it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|had the game for a couple of days now, and cant get enough of it.  very nice to be able to set the background and style of the deck of cards.  makes down time EASY!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Works great on my viewsonic g tablet. The game is puzzle based. I love problem-solving games. You really have to pay attention to the direction of the faces to figure out in which order to solve the puzzle.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love playing this game its awesome!(: I suck at it so I'm glad it has an easy ha yep(:
B0034G4P80|5.0|Just an enjoyable movie that was done just right.  Mostly serious, with a bit of humor. The acting, the scenery, the story line. well worth purchasing the movie.
B0012GVKW8|4.0|First off, I was skepticle of this purchase, just because of what I read here. I bought the older Blu Ray, not the Ultimate Hunter Edition. As far as the picture goes, there is not as much detail as say a new Blu Ray for a movie released this year. I honestly have no complaints about this. I love the film, it gets 5 stars. The Blu Ray is not what people are making it out to be. I read that the people now looked like were made of wax in the film, not at all true. DO NOT believe anything from the negative reviews. Head on over to BluRayreview.com and look up this Blu Ray, they do not complain about things like AMAZON reviewers do. They found the good. Take it from me, a previous skeptic, this is a very decent Blu Ray and I imagine this is the best Predator has looked to date.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Pretty decent game, can use some refinements but it is entertaining enough thus far. Add me as a neighbor Tommy_Mars!
1612130283|1.0|I haven't read a romance novel in decades but decided to download this to my Kindle after reading several reviews elsewhere. I thought it would be a nice break from my heavy diet of Nordic crime fiction.  Maybe I've been away from the genre too long, but I found this almost unbearable to read.  In fact, I found myself fast forwarding to the end because it was so bad.  The characters are wholly unbelievable and unlikeable, particularly the object of the heroine's affections - he's not only a jerk but also a sadomasicist. I cannot believe anyone would find this an entertaining read - it's too stupid to be erotic and too sick and twisted to be romantic.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Heard about the books on the TODAY show last week. Just finished reading book # 1 and already started on the second book I'll have the trilogy finish by the end of the week. I could not put the books down it just keeps you wanting more..I'll hate it when their done and will miss Christian & Ana. Great fantasy reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story is incredibly immersing.  I enjoyed really getting drawn into the strange world of Wool.  I would like to have seen this as one complete work to begin with, though, as there were 3-4 bits I'd like to have seen streamlined.  But overall, I really enjoyed the read and found it all hard to put down.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I just love the transformers movies.  I just bought a 3-D TV and was anxious to see it work.  I ordered this movie and it was fantastic.  I just love the action.  Good viewing for all family members.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I usually enjoy Sparks books.  This time I just didn't think it ended well.  It seems to me that the woman who it involved was a very selfish woman and really didn't greave for him even if she said that she would always love him.  She should have told her son that the person who he got his heart transplant was somebody that she loved.  At least that is what I think. He should have been honored for all that he did in life for others.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is one of my favorite games to play on my pc and laptop. I was happy to see that I could download it for free on my Kindle and on my Kindle Fire.
B004I744AS|5.0|its the best its great very useful I don't use that much but I know it great for kindle fire!!
1466401885|1.0|but apparently they will. i bought it, read it, am ashamed to admit it. it was really, really bad. totally forgettable, stupid characters. especially the guy (can't even remember his name), who was positively creepy with his stalker behavior and unnecessarily violent reactions to situations. it's hard to believe a woman wrote this. who the heck in their right mind wants to be subjected to a relationship like this?  escapism its worst.
0738711500|4.0|Start the book before you open the cards.  I am new to learning Tarot but the method recommended seems to work well. Great for beginners.
B0057R5XRG|1.0|Quite honestly, this isn't a Trilogy.  There is no reason they should even dare call this as such.  Pretty much what happened here is that there is one gem in this bunch; it's called Jurassic Park - the rest are b rated movies flicks.  None of the sequels would I ever care to own!!  However, for some weird reason they want to force someone to buy all three - and at a whopping price of nearly 50 dollars!!!  It's priced likewise everywhere (Walmart, Target, etc.) not just here on amazon.  It's the distributors who are trying to pawn it off as a trilogy.  There is no continuity of a story at all, it's just 3 different movies.  Frankly it's 3 movies about dinosaurs!!!<br /><br />Watch in about one year after they force this on people, they will come out with the 20th anniversary special edition.  And hopefully this bundled up propaganda will cease!!!
B006ZJJ6XW|4.0|It is interesting to hear how different people react to tha same recorded performance.  I own over fifteen sets of the complete Beethoven symphonies, and I have to say that this is one of the best recorded sets that I own.  Kudos should also be given to the Boston Symphony, who play magnificiently throughout, in the warm, resonant acoustic of Symphony Hall.<br /><br />Erich Leinsdorf's interpretations are in the Central European tradition of Walter, Bohm, and Karajan.  Tempos tend to be slowish (but not as overall slow as Klemperer), the orchestral sonority is rich and full, and accents are sharp.  These recordings are not for listeners of the H.I.P. tradition who like their Beethoven fast and light, or for those who are seeking to explore the metaphysical depths of the composer's psyche ala Furtwangler.  Leinsdorf's readings are not without idiosyncracies, but, all in all, these are pretty straighfoward interpretations in glorious sound.  A record collector, especially a first-time buyer, could do a lot worse than investing in this very reasonaly priced set.
B003U21TBO|5.0|When you think of epic romance, think of this episode: redemption, encouragement, hope! Most of the other travels are fun - you know, ghosts, vampires, aliens....but this is so utterly sweet and meaningful --- it ties in most everything about the show: the brevity and sanctity of life, the Doctor's line about good and bad piles, great art, true beauty, really seeing things for how they are. So many layers of goodness wrapped in...definitely a must watch even if you're brand new to Dr. Who, but the background gives a richer tapestry worth savoring. Go, watch, right now!
B006XOBFTM|3.0|Bruno Walter was a lifelong Mahler champion, and he gave the premiere of the Symphony #9 and Das Lied von der Erde.  These recordings, therefore, have great historical significance.<br /><br />The downside is that the recordings were made in the 1950's and early 1960's when the Mahler discography was not very large.  To realize their full impact, Mahler's works require more up-to-date sound than what was afforded Walter.  The 24-bit remastering has improved the sound somewhat, but these recordings cannot compare to the best that is available today.  In the fifty years since these recordings were made Mahler has probably been one of the most recorded composers.<br /><br />There will always be room in any large collection for Walter's Mahler recordings.  No conductor knew Mahler better, and being so closely allied to the composer, Walter also serves as a reminder of how these works should go.  For example, you won't notice the level of soul-baring in Walter's interpretations that other conductors feel should be part of this music.  But, anyone looking for the best performances in the best sound, are advised to look elsewhere.

140120841X|5.0|While all of my friends were getting into comic books I didn't understand the draw. I was never a big Superman, Spider Man, Batman, etc, fan. I especially didn't like superhero groups like the X-Men. Although I did like all of the above mentioned movies...<br /><br />So one day I went with some friends to the comic book store and I noticed a bunch of comic books, that would later make up the Vertigo line, were very different from what I considered a comic book. The shops owner noticed my disdain for mainstream comic books and my interest in titles like Sandman and Constantine. He asked if I had ever heard of Alan Moore, V for Vendetta or Watchmen.<br /><br />Of course I hadn't and he took me to the boxes containing a complete run of both. He then suggested I buy and read the first of each run and he would put the others in the set on hold in case I enjoyed them. If I didn't like them I could bring them back for a half price refund. Both of the #1's were priced around 6 bucks. I bit.<br /><br />Immediately I was taken back by the quality of the story writing, the portrayal of the characters both visually and through literary techniques, and how different this comic book was from what I knew comic books to be. I tried having my superhero fan friends read them and they didn't like them at all. Was it possibly that Alan Moore was writing comic books for intellectuals?<br /><br />The next day I went back to the store and bought the remaining books from both story lines, plus their graphic novels so I wouldn't damage the comics by reading them. Alan Moore made a comic book fan out of me. I would have to say that the superhero movies I mentioned in the open paragraph took from Moore's vision on story writing when they adapted their screen plays. Gone are the dorky, quirky utterances and also removed are the subplots with no meaning!<br /><br />If you don't like traditional comic books and/or didn't relate to the movie all that well, try the graphic novel! It is much betterthan the movie, whereas the traditional superhero movies were much better than the comic books!

B00005LK94|4.0|Lovely storyline about a young girl who recently lost her mother in a RTA and is now back in Canada with her father. She shares his love of the wildlife and protecting the natural environment though they are at odds with one another in the very beginning. She finds some abandoned geese eggs after developers have crushed the trees etc and chased away the wild geese. She hatches these eggs and the young geese think she is their mother - so she sets about raising and training them. Totally imprinted to believe that this 13 year old human is indeed their mother. Problem is how to get them to migrate south for the winter when they don't have a mother goose to show them the way. Father and daughter end up flying in micro aircraft with the 18 or so geese following them all the way south.<br />Wonderfully uplifting film, funny and sad but overall encouraging and engaging with environmental fundamentals. Lifts one' spirits and suitable viewing for all age groups.  Lovely family film which will amuse, entertain and teach everyone from children to senior citizens.  Absolute must for your DVD collection for showing to anyone at anytime.

0374275637|4.0|This was a really interesting book. Thinking Fast and Slow is the culmination of years of Daniel Kahneman's research into the nature of human decision making, how our minds process the world around us, and basically how people think. From the very start the reader must realize how difficult of a subject this is to explore and understand, let alone explain. Simply by being human, any researcher working on this has to keep in mind that he is prey to the very biases he is working to uncover.<br /><br />This book was organized and written very well. Kahneman divides the human mind into two systems from the very beginning, giving these systems traits and tendencies to help us relate to them in ourselves. System 1 is the fast and intuitive thinking, or (if I may generalize here) our subconscious thoughts; our automatic reactions, feelings and impressions. System 2 is our rational system; the one that is often more accurate, but takes up much more energy to use. Most of us can see those two \\"systems\\" within ourselves, and that makes the book easy to follow. He often brings up points that seem arbitrary only to have them neatly tied together to create a larger concept a chapter or two later.<br /><br />I feel like this book was created for those who tend to be of a less scientific mind. He uses examples of experiments very often in the book that seem on the surface to prove his point, but I often wondered about the details of the experiments, which were never included. Now don't get me wrong; I know nothing about Kahneman's career and have no reason to think he does not do his research as scientifically as possible; that information just isn't included in the book. This is an overall explanation of what his research has led him to conclude; if you're looking for details and numbers and results so you can reach your own conclusion, you won't find it here. For example:<br /><br />He wrote about an experiment where subjects heard various groups of words, then had to walk down a hallway to another room to do the second part of the experiment. The actual experiment was how long it took them to walk down the hall. Some people were given words that related to older people, disabilities, and generally being slow while other people were given words that related to young people, fitness, and generally being fast. People who were given the \\"slow words\\" took a significantly longer amount of time to walk the distance of the hall than those given the \\"fast words.\\" That's really all he tells the reader because that is all he needs to make his point. And reading that, it is very easy to jump to the conclusion \\"wow, just hearing words can change our actions\\" because it's interesting. He doesn't answer questions like: Could the words have evoked different themes in different people's minds? Was a background of the subjects taken to determine their general mood? Were the fast words speeding people up or the slow words slowing people down? How do you know this doesn't only work with certain themes? Etc.<br /><br />My point is, take Thinking Fast and Slow with a grain of salt. The book is fun to read in the way that personality tests are fun; it's always neat to learn more about ourselves, and it fulfills that somewhat narcissistic need in the reader. But that's system 1 thinking; if you go into this wanting proof, you won't get it. This is a subject very difficult to study objectively, and while I'm sure he did the job as well as possible, you can't know that by reading his book because he does not give details, he gives his conclusions.  And who can blame him? You don't sell a book by filling it with numbers, you sell it by making it easy to understand - and when you get into such cutting edge research, there just isn't a way to make it widely accessible and include all the nitty gritty details.<br /><br />I do believe this book is a very important stepping stone. Kahneman's research is just one step toward understanding the human mind. I think many ofthe experiments he talks about are not enough to draw conclusions, although he does the best that he can. Scientists will continue the same path of research he has taken for centuries to come, and his ideas will be expanded on, accepted or thrown out as we learn more. This isn't absolute truth. But if you are interested in where we stand on understanding the human mind and what theories are out there, then this book will be invaluable to you.<br /><br />I do not in any way think reading it is a waste of time since the ideas will most certainly change. Throughout the book he points out many of the common illusions that people fall prey to because of certain biases in our minds, and even if he doesn't have the processes behind them exactly right (who can really know if he does or not?), that doesn't mean the illusions aren't real.  Everyone can benefit from reading this book simply by being made aware of these pitfalls and therefore being able to avoid them in the future.<br /><br />So, what do I think? He went a little light on the explanations, and I wish he had provided more of the scientific details about his work. However, I understand that the book is already lengthy and so he may not have had much choice. I do absolutely recommend this book for any non-fiction readers interested in psychology or in improving their own thought processes.the experiments he talks about are not enough to draw conclusions, although he does the best that he can.

1401300529|5.0|Realizing that so many other books cover the battle experience of the U.S. military in Korea, David Halberstam's \\"The Coldest Winter\\" purposely tackles the forces of politics and ego that made the war possible in the first place.  The result reveals the hubris that ended up costing 37,000 U.S. lives, an unthinkable number that pales in comparison to the 1.5 million deaths in total for all combatants.<br /><br />Most of us think of Korea as a limited hot war within the larger context of the cold war between communist vs. capitalist powers.  It certainly was that--and more.  By reading this book, you'll see how the Korean War was a proxy for political gamesmanship on several levels between a variety of powerful interests.  The post World War II dynamic of east vs. west (i.e., communists vs. the U.S. and its allies) is merely the foundation for a number of subplots within each camp.  For example, Halberstam explains the leadership cults that formed very different totalitarian agendas in North Korea, China, and the Soviet Union.  The race to consolidate power within these regimes helps to explain their leaders' appetites for war and aggression.<br /><br />Politics are equally to blame for a number of shameful choices by U.S. leaders as well. Halberstam explains how the dynamics of two-party politics fostered ideological extremes during the post World War II era, a time during which the republicans desperately sought to regain influence in the wake of the democrats' 20-year stronghold on the White House.  The threat of communism fueled not only paranoia, but the \\"substance\\" on which political bona-fides were based.  Halberstam suggests that U.S. involvement in Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba were shaped by political on rivalry on Capitol Hill.  The ruthless but inexorable need to appear \\"tough\\" apparently guided many leaders who feared losing their power and influence by appearing otherwise.<br /><br />A direct consequence of the late 1940s political dynamic was U.S. policy toward China.  Thanks to his larger-than-life persona, General Douglas Macarthur was the de facto architect of that policy, despite constitutional provisions that would otherwise limit the military's influence on civilian policy making.  Halberstam explains how MacArthur's personal agenda set up the U.S. military to fail dismally in Korea during the winter of 1950-51.  This aspect of the book reveals how politics work between the military and its civilian leadership, and also within the leadership ranks of the military itself.<br /><br />A lot of text is devoted to mini-biographies of political leaders who shaped the events leading up to the Korean War.  This makes for sluggish reading at times, but I dare you to not be fascinated by some of these digressions.  Finally, about 25 percent of the book is devoted to recounting the experience of U.S. ground forces in pivotal battles such as Unsan, the Naktong, Chosin reservoir, and Chipyongni.  Based on Halberstam's interviews with survivors, these first-hand accounts become all the more poignant when we understand the larger political agenda that wasted and scarred so many lives.ard China.

1451683405|5.0|Sam Harris' slight volume is an excellent way to start digging into the topic of Free Will. The philosophical chestnut can fill large, daunting volumes but Harris' effort here is a wonderful primer for someone who is wondering what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />Conventional wisdom would have most believing that we each can wholly control our decisions at any one moment, but that has been roundly dis-proven by science.  We then move on to the  implications...and there are MANY implications. Religion, morality, criminal prosecution and much more are all PRIMARILY colored by the concept of free will. Many would imagine the collapse of society and all that we value, but we now know that such predictions are in error.  It is these implications that are most rewarding areas of contemplation and this book is a good kick starter for that contemplation.<br /><br />I give this 5 stars not for being the most exhaustive and informative, but for being the most accessible and least onerous treatises on the topic.
0553573403|5.0|My number one addiction of 2011 was the TV show Game of Thrones . When the first episode aired I wasn't sure I was gonna like it, but by the end of the episode I was hooked. It wasn't until towards the end of the season that I picked up the book to read. (yep, it took me a while to read)<br /><br />Once I got into the book I fell more in love with the world and the characters. I'm not sure I would have picked this one up if I hadn't seen the show, but I'm glad I did because I enjoy every minute of it. One of the amazing things is the shows creators have stayed quite true to the material, which is another reason to love both formats. A Game of Thrones really has everything. Fantasy, intrigue, adventure and even some romance. If you haven't picked this one up yet, I highly recommend it.

1609611543|4.0|The first half of the book was excellent--wonderful appraisal of research that is not normally encountered. Very informative. Unfortunately the logic degenerates in the second half of the book, where the claim is made that the ideal diet is what Neolithic people ate...but earlier in the book it was pointed out that the average Neolith only lived to age 35. Hmmm. I understand his point of view, as he has been a diabetic for many years and cannot tolerate the carbohydrate load of the average American, but this approach is really only ideal for someone who is insulin resistant and/or diabetic and wants to manage their blood sugar without the help of modern pharmaceuticals. It may not be so perfect for all the rest of us. After all, longevity has not been linked to eating this way (although most centagenarians ate non-dwarf wheat in their formative years, which may have played a role). I respect his opinion and am delighted that this book was published, because again the first half of the book contains very useful information which we would all do well to apply. I confess that I did find the author's writing style to be off-putting, somewhat crass. Read it for information and not entertainment.

B007918P1E|5.0|Its not often that a band can sound familiar, yet bring something new to the table.  This album sounds like Epica, yet they've stretched themselves in new ways. Ways that work, to the point where you go back to listen to their old material to see if they've been doing it all along and you just never noticed.  Its also nice to see such talent as Simone, who I already consider to be unparalleled, finding new ways to challenge herself.  You think you've heard it all? not yet...<br /><br />Some bands release albums of such caliber that they never reach that pinnacle again.  Take Metallica for example.  They have several albums that would make any list of greatest metal albums of all time, but Master of Puppets stands alone as perhaps the greatest metal album of all time.  This was early in their career, and they've yet to reach that pinnacle since.  Though this album is a bit later in their timeline, Epica may have just released their Master of Puppets, if you will, with Requiem for the Indifferent.<br /><br />The only thing I found disappointing in this album is the lack of a Roy Khan/Simone Simons duet...

One: it brought shock film horror into the mainstream more so than any other film. Two: the metaphor used for how our rich destroy those without money and power is brilliantly done. Three: there is actual truth behind the events taking place on the screen, this DOES happen in out world. If the images don't make you uneasy the message and realism of these events should. 5/5

B0072X2O66|2.0|It is no secret that I did not like the Adrenaline Mob EP much. In my opinion, the EP was quickly thrown together, poorly produced, and very underwhelming in the songwriting department. While this full-length album is much better than the first taste of the Mob we got a couple of months ago, it's still not very good. The musicians are talented, and the actual sound of the album is good; unfortunately, the songs aren't. The project, as a whole, is completely lacking in any substance of maturity.<br /><br />Regardless, the album starts off on a fairly good note. The first song, Undaunted, is a traditional hard-rock/metal offering, but at least it's got plenty of the promised \\"adrenaline\\" the Mob claims to have. The next song, Psychosane, is not bad either, and much better than the version we heard on the EP. Though I can't really pinpoint the difference between the two, the recording here just sounds tighter, more rehearsed, and better sounding. Still, it suffers from the horrendous spoken-word segment. I'm not sure who actually liked that, but Mike Portnoy for some reason does not seem to be able to accept what is perhaps the most common thing said about him since he stopped winning drummer awards: that he needs to step away from the microphone forever (No, Mike, it's not just 'internet trolls' that feel that way).<br /><br />The best song on the album might be the third song, \\"Indifferent\\", which has sort of a classic metal vibe to it (think \\"Eden's Curse\\"). At no later point on the album do the Mob sound as sure of themselves and together as they do on \\"Indifferent\\", and after the song ends the album plummets in quality. It is as if Omerta follows that typical commercial album format' start hard with three solid songs, throw in a bunch of songs no-one will listen to more than once, and stick a potential single (Angel Eyes) somewhere in the mix near the end of the record. Unfortunately, little about the album is memorable, and when it is, it's often for the wrong reasons: because you hear some really strained vocals (Believe Me), or some really silly lyrics (Freight Train).<br /><br />There's an undeniable level of talent here, but the end result is a Brooklyn circus. Russell Allen strains his vocals to sound tough and \\"metal\\", even more than he has on the last two Symphony X records. Sometimes it sounds good, and other times it sounds like he's trying to hard. Mike Orlando performs the same, or similar, sounding tap-solos over and over again, and never pulls it together to play something that someone who is not a shredder might appreciate. Mike is just there; he gives a good performance, but drums alone can't save the fact that the songs are just not good. The lyrics stink, frankly, and never move beyond the adolescent (I guess being a fan of the band means you consider hormonal teen-rage to be synonymous with 'adrenaline', though).<br /><br />Given an outside songwriter and decent producer, the band might actually be able to do something interesting. But, as is, they're just as average as average metal gets. This, as sports fans know well, is what happens when you assemble a lot of talent together without a thought for discipline, direction, or maturity.asons: because you hear some really strained vocals (Believe Me), or some really silly lyrics (Freight Train).<br /><br />There's an undeniable level of talent here, but the end result is a Brooklyn circus.

B00095NX9G|5.0|What I like the best about this DVD is it gives you a bunch of pieces to mix and match in a way that suits your needs.  From beginner to expert, from a half an hour to three hours, drills to conditioning to choreography, you can mix and match sections to meet your needs.  It is an excellent supplement to in class work.  I belong to a troupe, and I use it to make my drilling and conditioning work i do on my own more interesting and effective.
1400049628|1.0|I got this as a present and let me be clear, I am a big zombie apocalypse fan.  This book takes something that is fun, interesting, scary, funny, and explains everything about it.  Isn't that what makes it fun, the fact that it's unknown?  Lets see if I can make a good comparison.  Take sex, then explain everything that could possibly happen and how to deal with it in a really boring guide book.  Now you have...well...sex, but it's just not as much fun anymore.  Trust me, I'm right about this. Not sure what the heck everybody else is getting out of this that I'm not.
B006VRZ5YM|1.0|This movie was terrible. I purchased this to watch on a flight, expecting a typical mediocre rom-com that would at least entertain me and give me a few chuckle's for its ridiculousness. But really, you should just pass. While I normally love Anna Farris, the acting is terrible and the plot is so beyond transparent it's hard to stay interested. I at least expected a few good laughs but again, you could see the punch lines coming a mile away and the humor bordered on just plain dumb more than funny.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Fabulous book, both historical and enchanting, kept me rooting for the heroin. Couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end.  Would recomend it highly to any type of reader, but especially a historian
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I wasn't actually expecting to like this book as much as I thought I would. It sounded like a cool and unique \\"magic that's not magic\\" gimmick, using metals to fuel super-natural powers in some people, but I wondered if the novelty would quickly wear off or if things would be too ridiculous to enjoy. Instead I was surprised to find I could hardly put the book down the further I got into it. I ended up getting the second and third books in the series shortly after finishing this one. It's a great foundation for the rest of the series, but also was good enough that I could have read it alone and still be satisfied with it.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|this bill organization app is so simple its funny! it keeps a simple single list of bills that are due shortly and allows you to pick an advanced reminder time as well. it is the perfect simple organizor that everyone can use. perfect!
B005GVW05Q|4.0|Just discovered this artist through Spotify( I am probably a bit older than the average Ryan Adams fan). Bought the CD after auditioning. The best recommendation I can give is that I keep coming back to this album and listening..., again and again. Very good stuff.

B007JF87VS|2.0|I really cannot believe what they have done to this show. It really seems like AMC and its set of unsophisticated, juvenile writers have their heart set on ruining this show by process of elimination of one important character at a time. Last week we saw Dale, a relatively major and regular cast member who provided an important dynamic to the group, be killed off in the most outlandish way (a zombie opening up his chest cavity with his bare hands, yeah right), and this week Shane, a principal cast member, was also booted off the show.<br /><br />AMC should just cancel the show. They ruined it. Killing off Shane was an even more epic mistake than killing off Dale. Shows rarely recover from such major cast changes. Yes I know, in the comics, Shane dies pretty early on. But<br /><br />1) the show has already deviated quite substantial from the comics anyway and<br />2) Shane was a regular cast member and the audience had established a connection to him. He was a major player. Killing off major characters like that is demoralizing.<br /><br />So killing him this late on was a huge mistake and I dont think people realize how much his absence will be felt as the show continues. It will change everything.<br /><br />Personally, I dont care much for following this past season 2. I might take a peek out of curiosity every now and then but this show is done for me. Shane was a central figure - controversial or not and the writers just turned his character into a caricature.<br /><br />Word has it that Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale) left the show because AMC fired Darabont and he just didn't want anything to do with the show anymore and that Jon Bernthal (Shane) left for the same reason. In fact, Bernthal has been cast in Darabont's next TV project, \\"L.A. Noir\\". So it seems like the writers messed it up for everyone so badly by firing the head creative mind followed by lousy writing and the direction they took the show in general, that now half the cast are leaving voluntarily. Next week more will be killed off; personally I am betting on T-Dog, Hershel and Carol but it wouldnt surprise me if they offed Glenn too.<br /><br />This show should have been about the adventure and this disease and trying to find answers as well as surviving, traversing the landscape marred by the apocalypse. Darabont set it up masterfully: dark, and sad and sinister. When Amy died and turned, the transformation was tragic and sad and it had resonance. They didn't even do that with Shane, it was just rushed and he turned almost instantly. It's like they couldn;t get it over with fast, to finish up in the time allotted.<br /><br />The writers, after Darabont's departure, have degraded this show to soap opera level with lousy writing. Some drama and tragedy is good (like in season one) as it humanizes the show, but this show has become just that, a drama. Zombies and the zombie apocalypse have become the mere incidental backdrop.<br /><br />Rick saw a helicopter in season one, but we dont know what happened and he never mentioned it again and no one ever asked again. If the world had come to an end and I saw a helicopter in the sky I would have hope that there is something left and ask questions and purse, instead of hanging out on little house on the prairie bickering with my best friend over some woman.<br /><br />+ WHY IS THAT KID UNSUPERVISED? Over and over again, he just pops up in a scene. I mean since Lori gave Andrea a lecture on how to be a good doormat of a woman, she just got the award for the worst freaking mother EVER for letting her son wander around the zombie-overrun world unsupervised. Is this a joke?<br /><br />+I liked how no one was phased about Dale's death. Maybe with the exception of Glenn, everyone just sort of went about their business like nothing of proportions happened. Andrea, from what I gather in the comics, was shattered at Dale, whom she was close to, dying but here she just had this dumb grin on her face like \\"oh well, things happen\\".<br/><br />+ Very stealthy of both the readers and Shane to drag Rick into the open field to kill him.<br /><br />+ This episode, much like the last and half a dozen before it, is not about zombies and end of the world. They are about two Alphas stuck in a \\"how long is my ding dong\\" contest and the entire show has been just about that; which contributed to the complete and utter destruction of Shane's character into nothing but a caricature and stereotype of the psycho Alpha.<br /><br />Apparently the term Walking Dead refers to the living, not to the dead. In this episode it is somehow established, in the finest tradition of vague and incoherent story telling these writers are accustomed to,  that whatever that virus is that turns you, has apparently infected everyone, the living, so that now everyone turns, even if they were were not bit. If that is true, then why didnt we see that anywhere in the show (except for 2 episodes ago)? They spent the whole first season showing how people who get bit, and bit only, develop the symptoms such as getting a fever and dying. Not ONCE did they ever show an incidence that it was otherwise. We saw dead bodies on the highway that had not turned; now suddenly the dead turn without a bite. That doesn't make sense and it's called continuity or lack thereof.<br /><br />The assumption is that the virus mutated and that this is what Jenner told Rick. But that also doesn't make sense. Why would Jenner withhold that info from everyone except for Rick. I mean why wouldnt he just tell  everyone that they are infected? He told them everything else; in fact, he had them under lock up and tried to convince them to die. This information would have served beautifully in that capacity. I mean, what's in it for him to lie anyway? That just doesnt makes sense and the only way it makes sense is that the writers are in fact just making this up as they go along - which evidently is what has been happening since they fired Darabont.<br /><br />With regard to Shane: instead of keeping the differences in opinion between Rick and Shane to a manageable level and expanding on it, so as to keep the antagonism with regard to how to approach the post apocalypse, they turned this how into this stagy, melodramatic love triangle and Shane into American Psycho, ruining his character.<br /><br />The thing is, Shane's character provided an important aspect and tension to the show. He was the guy who seemed headstrong, having gotten a little carried away given the totally desperate situation they are in (this is the zombie Apocalypse after all, we'd all lose it), but he was also strong and made sense and the audience was split, some agreed with him, some didn't, reflecting exactly the kinds of dilemmas these people were facing as a group: make an attempt to keep our humanity or stay strong and adhere to the no nonsense attitude Shane was advocating to survive. When Shane insisted they give up searching for the girl, audiences agreed. He was believable, he made sense. Remember Shane was shocked seeing Sophia come out of the barn, he consoled Carol after Sophia's demise, he did feel bad when he shot Otis to get away. He had humanity, which they stripped off him for no good reason. And instead of continuing to keep his character complicated like that, they went overboard and turned him into a psycho who was about to murder his childhood and best friend over a stupid woman. Huge fail.<br /><br />There is such a thing called consistency within a plot dear AMC writers. You cant just make characters, in a span of 10 days, act out of character like that and make a 180 degree turn. Shane's character was not a sociopath. He had rough edges but he had compassion too.<br /><br />I am gravely disappointed with how this show has turned out. AMC should continue on its path of crappy cheapness, as they did with this show by keeping the cast on the same place for the whole season and firing the creative head talent, and just cancel the show.<br/><br />There is a lot of serious narrative fail in not only this episode but throughout the second season and I think people are starting to feel the void of Frank Darabont and his masterful storytelling. The network and the crappy, cheap writing has literally driven away most of the actors.

B0011NVCSO|5.0|Several years before Bon Iver made the big time with 2011's self-titled realease, he (Justin Vernon) recorded this album at a hunting cabin in northeast Wisconsin during the winter of 2006-2007. It is really good. In fact I like it more than the newer album. Although all the songs have an ethereal beauty about them, I've really enjoyed listening to \\"Lump Sum\\", the second track. This is a new pressing so everything is perfect as I write this.
B005KAH7QU|3.0|I was expecting more from this movie.  Some of the back story was overexplained and some was barely touched on at all.  Not a total waste of time but when the movie ended I was left feeling it needed more.

B005OZE9SA|5.0|For me being a solo 12 string guitar and vocal act this works just fine for me. And you get the extra plugs ins supplied by Focusrite too with this interface. I cannot say I am wild about the included software which is Ableton Live Lite 8. I really disliked the screen views of Ableton and thought they were hard to view. So I did some scouting around and talked to a few techs and they suggested Mixcraft 6. WOW! I like a mixing board that is right up in my face and no guesswork. Mixcraft 6 is so user friendly and you don't have to bring in a professor from another planet to understand it. You can be laying down and recording tracks in no time. And shouldn't recording be fun and not frustrating besides? The Focusrite Interface recognized Mixcraft 6 as if it were an old school bud and the extra plug ins. So all and all it turned out great and I am a happy camper. This in my opinion is one of the best entry level Recording Audio Interface units around. It also has phantom power for those of you who have condenser mikes requiring phantom power. Dollar for dollar you cannot go wrong with this interface. Engineered in England. And on the downside, made in China. (Isn't everything these days?)

0307949508|4.0|Stieg Larsson is not your typical thriller-on-the-beach writer. What this book and the rest of the series offers, is an exciting yet depressingly accurate insight into the flow of crime that coarses through the veins of Sweden today and those who have the misfortune to be caught up with in it, from the victims to the police, security firms and journalists tasked with catching the perpetrators, while the character uniting those disparate elements is the queen of all anti-heroines; Lisbeth Salander. Never before has such a flawed, awkward yet inspirational female character been created, her multiple strengths and weaknesses far more convincing than the countless other male leads that populate the crime genre.

And all this for such an incredible price.<br /><br />The front cover folds back out of the way or to make an easel.  One thing I would change is to add a holding strap or slot in the inside fold for holding a stylus. I would also consider making the cover available in a version with a closing strap. This said, I still give it 6 stars out of 5. Terrific product, great buy!

The story I would say is decent (better than a Juan Claude Van Damme movie in my opinion). The fighting is ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! This movie makes you want to get up and smash the neighborhood bullies face, lol. Overall, this purchase is definitely worth it and VERY ENTERTAINING. I WOULD HAVE PAID DOUBLE WHAT ITS WORTH JUST TO HAVE IT.<br /><br />If you guys have questions about the purchase, feel free to message me.

B004H83IM8|1.0|I bought the three disc set thinking it would be great to watch.  I was wrong.  The 1st movie wouldn't play at all and the third movie would play except for the last chapter.  Something with the discs are not right as it would tweak my Blu-Ray player out to the point I would have to unplug it and reset it to get it to play.  These are the only discs that it does that with.  All my other discs, both DVD and Blu-Ray play fine.  Yes, I did clean the lens and watched a couple other movies afterwards with no problem.  No, there is no dirt or scratches on the discs themselves so that tells me it has to be something in the way the discs were recorded to begin with.  Don't waster your money on these.

B0073LWEXK|3.0|This was my first game.  NOT a good idea.  It does not have instructions.  I had no idea how to play. It was very frustrating.

My six year old loves the levels where you squish the food.<br /><br />I was annoyed that rotating the objects seemed cumbersome but I read a tip on these reviews that said<br /><br />\\" As for rotating, the best way to do it is to hold a grocery item with one finger and tap anywhere else on the screen with a different finger. Every time you tap, the grocery should rotate 90 degrees.\\"<br /><br />That works perfectly, I wish I would have know that tidbit before.<br /><br />I play this on the kindle and I have never had any problems.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I started watching Hawaii 5-0 one afternoon on CBS.com when my 18 month old was sick and wouldn't let me put him down, so I sat with him in bed and watched most of season 2.  I than went and bought season 1 on DVD and have enjoyed it very much.  I never have seen the origional series since it was on long before I was born, but this seems to be a very well made show, with decent plots.  I like that there is a undertone in each episode about Steve's past but that it doesn't consume each episode.  I like learning a little more about his past each episode.<br />The banter between Danny and Steve is silly, funny and very east coast dry.<br />I just mailed my husband season 1 for his birthday(which he is spending in Afghanistan) and he is a huge fan of the origonal series.  I will update when he sees it.<br />Great show.  Sorry Gibbs, NCIS has been replaced with Hawaii 5-0!!!!!

B00563M11M|5.0|I must admit , I like the Death stories more than the copper , Sam Vimes - but I think that's because my first Terry Pratchett novel ever , was Hogfather. None the less, this latest Discworld epic , is exactly what we would expect , as Sir Terry fans, and everything a newbie could want in terms of a good old fashioned cops and robbers story. I've read it twice already , and currently reading it aloud to a family member with a reading impairment , and I am still collapsing in giggles and fits of laughter at the more obvious jokes , and chuckling quietly to myself at the wry sardonic notes on what it means to be human. You can't help feeling that there's a little of Sam Vimes in all of us, the person who does the right thing , even though they really just want to beat up the bad guys.
B006ZT47O0|5.0|Epica's 2012 recipe: take their career-defining 2009 masterpiece [[ASIN:B002N1AERI Design Your Universe]], keep the same line-up and the same producer (Sascha Paeth) cross-pollinate with side projects, infuse with current events and voilà: Requiem for the Indifferent.<br /><br />It was unavoidable that RTFI, Epica's fifth studio album (sixth if you count [[ASIN:B000B8WEB4 Score: An Epic Journey]]), would had some difficulty topping their previous release that installed them squarely at the top of the new symphonic metal wave. But it is pretty close. And considering how intricate Epica's productions have become, it might be just as good once it becomes more familiar. What is obvious is that Epica has hit their stride: DYU was the album that marked the maturation of their style and they are now building their canon. Hopefully, they will be able to sustain the pace.<br /><br />It is always tempting to criticize Epica for their bombast or for Mark Jansen's polymath pronouncements on all sorts of current events. When Design Your Universe was telling us that we could indeed shape our own lives, Requiem For The Indifferent goes one step further, telling us that we have no excuse for sitting out the challenges of our times. The album name apparently went through several changes (Requiem for Indifference, Serenade of Self-Destruction) but the concept remains the same. Hence the title track but also Deep Water Horizon, Deter the Tyrant or Internal Warfare. It merges the financial crisis, the Arab Spring, the Utøya massacre and other dramas of the age.<br /><br />It is possible that Jansen and cohorts are overreaching and a little preachy but they are usually elegantly oblique about it and one has to applaud their constant effort to keep Epica away from the ornate, artificial imagery too easily favored by goth or symph metal bands. By comparison, Xandria's new album, the otherwise catchy and commendable [[ASIN:B006JJBFK0 Neverworld's End]], seems more like an attempt to recapture the glory of Nightwish circa [[ASIN:B0002ZYE1Y Once]]. It includes beautiful songs and the uncanny Tarja Turunen-channeling of new singer Manuela Kraller but it does not deliver the same feeling of urgency or uniqueness.<br /><br />Musically speaking, RFTI also builds on DYU but with some enrichment. Simone Simons has probably never been better used, not only in a variety of singing styles but also by favoring her mid-range where she is at her best. The twists and turns of the music bring it closer and closer to the Prog sphere. And guitarist Isaac Delahaye is completely integrated in the writing process, participating in a majority of the tracks. Epica adds layer upon layer of sound and somehow still manages to juggle them all for good effect. Overall, it is a gorgeous writing collaboration among Delahaye, Jansen, Janssen (Coen) and Simons.<br /><br />A few minor peeves: an occasional clean vocal might sometimes do better than a grunt. Short of Death Metal bands that go by the motto \\"hoarse is the new normal\\", the overuse of grunts does not always serve the material best. Said material is also probably going to be quite difficult to perform with the same quality live (there is a reason why Epica is quite short on live DVDs...).<br /><br />All the songs are spectacular and will take their time to sink in. The early ear-catchers are, understandably, the very catchy Storm the Sorrow and the next song, Delirium, perfecting the metal lied genre in which Epica has no match today. But what strikes in general is the slightly harder edge of RFTI over DYU. I believe it has a lot to do with the band's side collaborations and projects. Mark Jansen devoted a lot of 2011 to his other band MaYaN and their impressive [[ASIN:B004SKI77Q Quarterpast]] that sounded like Epica on steroids and offered the other pleasure of an After Forever reunion of sorts with the presence of Floor Jansen. The echo is even thematic, with echoes of MaYaN's Drown the Demon's \\"shift the blame...\\" onRFTI's title track. Epica has also had a good amount of interaction with Kamelot over the years, mostly because Kamelot's keyboardist's Oliver Palotai is Simone Simons' significant other. Very much like Mark Jansen, Palotai also has another band, Sons of Seasons, equally harder edge than the mothership, with two excellent albums so far, [[ASIN:B001UDPBWS Gods of Vermin]] and [[ASIN:B004LKLRZM Magnisphyricon]], to which Simons has collaborated. In addition, Palotai has also served as Epica's keyboardist during their 2010 north american tour.<br /><br />In the end, I believe you hear a lot of MaYaN and some of Sons of Seasons in the new Epica. This is very good, with an album that will be one of the highlights of the year. Here is hoping that Epica continues doing this for a long time.

B007918P1E|5.0|Epica's 2012 recipe: take their career-defining 2009 masterpiece [[ASIN:B002N1AERI Design Your Universe]], keep the same line-up and the same producer (Sascha Paeth) cross-pollinate with side projects, infuse with current events and voil&agrave;: Requiem for the Indifferent.<br /><br />It was unavoidable that RTFI, Epica's fifth studio album (sixth if you count [[ASIN:B000B8WEB4 Score: An Epic Journey]]), would had some difficulty topping their previous release that installed them squarely at the top of the new symphonic metal wave. But it is pretty close. And considering how intricate Epica's productions have become, it might be just as good once it becomes more familiar. What is obvious is that Epica has hit their stride: DYU was the album that marked the maturation of their style and they are now building their canon. Hopefully, they will be able to sustain the pace.<br /><br />It is always tempting to criticize Epica for their bombast or for Mark Jansen's polymath pronouncements on all sorts of current events. When Design Your Universe was telling us that we could indeed shape our own lives, Requiem For The Indifferent goes one step further, telling us that we have no excuse for sitting out the challenges of our times. The album name apparently went through several changes (Requiem for Indifference, Serenade of Self-Destruction) but the concept remains the same. Hence the title track but also Deep Water Horizon, Deter the Tyrant or Internal Warfare. It merges the financial crisis, the Arab Spring, the Utøya massacre and other dramas of the age.<br /><br />It is possible that Jansen and cohorts are overreaching and a little preachy but they are usually elegantly oblique about it and one has to applaud their constant effort to keep Epica away from the ornate, artificial imagery too easily favored by goth or symph metal bands. By comparison, Xandria's new album, the otherwise catchy and commendable [[ASIN:B006JJBFK0 Neverworld's End]], seems more like an attempt torecapture the glory of Nightwish circa [[ASIN:B0002ZYE1Y Once]]. It includes beautiful songs and the uncanny Tarja Turunen-channeling of new singer Manuela Kraller but it does not deliver the same feeling of urgency or uniqueness.<br /><br />Musically speaking, RFTI also builds on DYU but with some enrichment. Simone Simons has probably never been better used, not only in a variety of singing styles but also by favoring her mid-range where she is at her best. The twists and turns of the music bring it closer and closer to the Prog sphere. And guitarist Isaac Delahaye is completely integrated in the writing process, participating in a majority of the tracks. Epica adds layer upon layer of sound and somehow still manages to juggle them all for good effect. Overall, it is a gorgeous writing collaboration among Delahaye, Jansen, Janssen (Coen) and Simons.<br /><br />A few minor peeves: an occasional clean vocal might sometimes do better than a grunt. Short of Death Metal bands that go by the motto \\"hoarse is the new normal\\", the overuse of grunts does not always serve the material best. Said material is also probably going to be quite difficult to perform with the same quality live (there is a reason why Epica is quite short on live DVDs...).<br /><br />All the songs are spectacular and will take their time to sink in.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Team Gale! I read the Hunger Games and absolutely loved it! It was so twisted, but such a good read! I cannot wait to read the rest of the books in the series(3) and see the movie! The movie doesn't doesn't look that good, but I want to see it just because I read the book. This book was a thumbs up! I recommend this book to all of my book lovers in grades fifth and up. The beginning of this book isn't so enjoyable, but I guarantee that if you stay with the book, it will become great! This is a must read and I hope you have experience that I did when I read this book! Enjoy!
B001QOGYFY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie enough to buy the blu-ray. Kate Beckinsdale was given an opportunity to show offer her acting ability rather than just her body as has been the case in many of her other roles, though near the start of the film she does both. I found myself really feeling her pain and anguish in two key scenes and gained new respect for her talent. The downside to this film is the poor quality of the special effects. In the scene with the man falling out of a window, it looked absolutely terrible, as if the director either didn't care or ran out of money and it couldn't be helped. The flash-back scenes are all quite bad, actually. Fortunately, the rest of the film is believable as there aren't too many special effect scenes. I will be watching it again! It's not my favorite movie but goes well with The Thing if you're in the mood for an evening in antarctica! ;)

B005S0HNU2|4.0|This is going to a rather odd review considering that season four of \\"Merlin\\" has the very best and worst that the show has to offer. On the one hand, it has some of the most sophisticated storylines, the highest production values and the strongest performances from its young cast that have thus far featured on the show. There is also far less filler (a great improvement on the last season, which seemed to be composed almost entirely of padding) and greater care taken with continuity and overarching plot-threads. On the other hand, it still suffers from the usual problems: a lack of meaningful character development, the irritating marginalization of its two female characters, and its stubborn refusal to let Merlin finally reveal his magical abilities to Arthur.<br /><br />To recap this review in a nutshell: the first half of this season is the best that \\"Merlin\\" has ever been - but the second half falls apart, leading to an entirely lackluster finale. If you're not in the mood to read any further, consider that my conclusive statement on series four.<br /><br />But [[ASIN:B004LROMQG last season]] ended on a high note what with Prince Arthur assembling his most trusted knights and winning back Camelot from his half-sister's control. With Morgana defeated and King Uther in a state of deep depression over his daughter's betrayal, series four opens a year later with Arthur in firm control of the kingdom. In this he's helped by a new arrival: his uncle Agravaine, who establishes himself as the young prince's closest advisor.<br /><br />Obviously, things are not going to be smooth-sailing for long. Morgana is determined to take her revenge on Camelot, and having grown in magical powers and established a spy in Camelot to feed her information (as well as donning a new all-black wardrobe), she certainly feels like a more dangerous adversary than she did last year. Yet soon she becomes paranoid by a series of warnings about a figure known as Emrys, a powerful sorcerer who is destined to be her doom. As she begins her obsessive search for him, she remains unaware that he is none other than Merlin himself.<br /><br />In some semblance of order, here are my thoughts on the good and bad aspects of series four: (spoilers will be marked).<br /><br />ACTING: As always, the cast is top-notch, and manage to infuse some rather dodgy writing with genuine emotion and resonance. Its four young cast members in particular are given some really juicy scenes this time around, and are all exceptional at conveying heartbreak, terror, joy, relief and steely determination on command. The writers of \\"Merlin\\" are damn lucky that they've got Colin Morgan, Bradley James, Angel Coulby and Katie McGrath on board, as their charisma does wonders at plastering over some of the gaping plot-holes that the writers leave in their scripts.<br /><br />Backing them up are a range of British thespians, not only Anthony Stewart Head, John Hurt, Richard Wilson and Nathanial Parker as series regulars, but a bevy of big-name stars that pop in for guest spots: Gemma Jones, James Callis, Lindsay Duncan, Gary Lewis, Terence Maynard, Ben Daniels, Miranda Raison - granted, these names may not mean much to the average viewer, but once you see their faces on-screen I guarantee that you'll be nodding your head and saying: \\"oh yeah...I know them...\\" This season also has plenty of eye-candy on display with the new knights of Camelot, all played by actors who could have quite easily pursued a career in modeling, and who enjoy walking around in various states of undress.<br /><br />TOP-NOTCH PRODUCTION VALUES: With an upgrade to 35mm film and the acquisition of a huge green-screen, \\"Merlin\\" now looks good enough for the movie theatre. The sets are bigger, the camera-work is smoother, the CGI is more convincing, the makeup/costumes are as lovely as ever, and there's an altogether \\"bigger\\" feel to the scale of the show.<br /><br />DARKER THEMES: \\"Merlin\\" feels a lot more grown-up this timearound. Major characters die and stay dead, forcing those left behind to come to terms with their absence. Likewise, there's mercifully less pushing of the reset button: this season things change, and change for good in Camelot. Having treaded water for so many years, the writers are finally taking some significant steps toward the Golden Age that Arthur is prophesied to usher in.<br /><br />I also don't recall any fart gags this time around, but though there's still plenty of lame slapstick humor, there are also some of the most dramatic scenes seen yet on the show. Colin is asked to cry practically every episode and manages to do so in a way that will break your heart each time, and Bradley and Angel share a scene that apparently ended with them getting a round of applause from the crew - you'll know it when you see it. Furthermore, Katie now portrays a much more nuanced Morgana, and the smirk that typified her performance last year has been considerably toned down.<br /><br />EPISODES ONE TO SEVEN: For the first time, the \\"Merlin\\" writers move away from self-contained episodes in order to tell a story that spans several episodes, with events happening in each that directly affects what happens in the next. In a show in which the villains are responsible for driving most of the action, it was a wise decision to give Morgana a clear, singular goal (the search for Emrys) thus leaving Agravaine to stir up trouble in Camelot. The overarching story begins to rise to a climax as Morgana closes in on Merlin's secret, Agravaine tries to incriminate someone else for his role as the traitor in Camelot, Arthur and Guinevere make significant steps forward in becoming the future King and Queen, and Merlin learns more about his heritage as a Dragonlord, as well as his alter-ego 'Emrys'.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW...<br /><br />EPISODES EIGHT TO THIRTEEN: It's not that the remaining six episodes are *bad*, it's simply that they have nothing whatsoever to do with the previous seven. It's almost as though the writers abruptly changed their minds about what this season was going to be about and rewrote the ending as a muddle of unrelated stories that deal with the Arthurian Love Triangle (well acted, but badly handled), two filler episodes (concerning yet another evil villainess and a Druid-ghost), a 45-minute prologue to the finale (Agravaine and Morgana plot whilst Arthur fluffs about with a random princess) and the two-part finale itself - which really is a disappointment compared to the excitement and emotional resonance of the show's past season finales: \\"Le Mort d'Arthur\\", \\"The Last Dragonlord\\" and \\"The Coming of Arthur.\\"<br /><br />The ending reflects badly on the season's strong beginning, simply because it highlights all the lost opportunities and leaves so many dangling plot-threads. Morgana's search for Emrys gave her new focus and storylines - it goes nowhere after episode seven. The Arthurian Love Triangle was suitably emotional and heartbreaking - instead of resolving it, it's just sweep under the rug. The \\"traitor in our midst\\" story-arc - dropped entirely. Morgana takes over Camelot with ease and Arthur wins it back just as effortlessly - a blatant retreat of last season's finale.<br /><br />A chance to see the knights as individuals, learning and growing and bonding together - they're just an interchangeable red-cloaked hoard. Guinevere's rise to power - ignored after her first confrontation with Agravaine in favor of shaming and humiliating her, and then not even bothering to exonerate her good name. Agravaine - hogs way too much screen-time and remains a cypher throughout (without relying on guess-work, can anyone explain to me where he came from, what his motivation was, or what kind of power he planned to get from Morgana that he didn't already have with Arthur?) Arthur - still completely oblivious to pretty much everything that goes on around him.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0036EH3U2 James Callis]] as an intriguing villain - wasted. Tristan and Isolde - pointless. Merlin and Gwaine's friendship - non-existent. That goes ditto for Guinevere and Elyan - they're meant to be siblings, but you wouldn't know it from watching any of these episodes. Lancelot - an ignoble and disappointing end for such an iconic character. Percival - we still don't know a thing about him beyond the fact that he has nice arms.<br /><br />And the long-awaited magical reveal...? Not this season.<br /><br />To put it briefly, this show is great at set-up, but usually disappoints when it's pay-off time. The writers often introduce new plot-points only to lose interest in them; as such it's difficult to really invest in anything when you can't be sure that it'll get resolved in any meaningful way. Furthermore, the show is so plot-heavy (racing from one \\"big moment\\" to the next) that there's no breathing room to explore the characters. When there *is* a quiet moment, it's usually repetitive or filled with exposition. Most of the time the characters exist in service to the plot and not the other way around, leading them to change dramatically from episode to episode - they are only as smart, effective and/or observant as the plot requires them to be (and when the plot *doesn't* require them to be these things, they end up looking immensely stupid).<br /><br />So despite the welcome shaking up of the status-quo this year, season four of \\"Merlin\\" is a mixed bag, and there's still a long way to go in bringing the main characters to a satisfying conclusion in what is rumored to be the fifth and final season. Were I able to, I would rank this season three-and-half-stars; I went with four rather than three simply because I still enjoy this show as fluffy, relatively mindless entertainment. It's just that I'm constantly aware of just how much better it could be with sharper, braver writing that isn't afraid to explore the characters and let their stories grow organically.n.

B002C949AE|5.0|Desert Flower is the true story of supermmodel Waris, who is from Somalia. She had a loving family but because of cultural norms she was put through female circumcision, a horrendous practice that occurs in many African and Muslam countries. When her father arranged a marriage for her to an old man, she ran away, crossing a desert with no food or water. She was so very brave, much more then I would ever be. She left everything she knew and loved and ended up first in a Somalian city and then went with a wealthy family to be a maid in London. She was not given any opportunity to educate herself but despite her circumstances she was determined to find her own way. It is an inspiring story that I will read again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Although I love dystopias, I hate that there are so few that are really good.  I'm used to stumbling upon half written, stilted ending and frustrating desperate attempts.  This is not one of those.  Oh, no.  This is well written, enthralling, and it will suck your soul in and hold it hostage until you finish it.  I gasped, I name called, I shook my fist, and I had to wash my mouth out with soap on several occasions.  You know it's a good book (or series of books) when you start blowing bubbles when you speak.  I am now a fan and will begin anxiously reading more from Mr. Howey.  I expect to see big things from him, and await these things with bubbled breath.

It's not bad, but I find it to be a bit too much violent and the plot is not that easy for young kids.

B00729GQ0A|4.0|Sophia lives in a small town where her Wiccan practices are disapproved of by the local church. Research into her family's history leads her towards finding out about the voices in her mind, but also leads her into a dark world where the vampiric Cruor rule. Can she trust the mysterious Charles after her friends turn away from her?<br /><br />I was given this copy of The Forever Girl by the Author herself in a Twitter giveaway. Paranormal romance isn't usually my favourite but I was so glad I went ahead and read it. This story is dark yet gripping - I had a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />Early on in the story I couldn't help but compare it to Twilight a little: Girl meets mysterious, gorgeous boy who says \\"You shouldn't get attached to me, it's too dangerous\\", she says \\"OMG, get me some of that\\" and he protects her from the Vampire powers-that-be (I don't mean that as a slight on Twilight, by the way. I rather enjoyed the books when I read them - up until Breaking Dawn, anyway).<br /><br />As the story moved forward, twists and turns made sure that I never knew what to expect next. The story was fast-paced and exciting and the Wiccan rituals and history of the Cruor and other elementals were fascinating.<br /><br />Sophia was a great character - she was so strong and determined, but I felt so sorry for her by the end! She tries her hardest and faces each new challenge in a very believeable and engaging way. Charles, on the other hand, I did not connect well with. Apart from seeming a little too perfect, he drove me (and Sophia) mad with his hot/cold attitude - one minute telling her to stay away and acting all stand-offish and the next moment, whispering sweet nothings in her ear. I wanted to slap him! The romantic scenes were well put together though and fit in well with the events in the story.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading The Forever Girl. It's a fantastic debut from Rebecca Hamilton, and I'll look forward to the release of book two, Her Sweetest Downfall, later this year.wnfall, later this year.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|How can you go wrong with a story about eternal youth featuring pirates, Indians and mermaids? Clumsy hands can ruin even a magnificent story but in this case Disney produced one of cinema's great masterpieces. Peter Pan is as close to perfection as any film I have ever watched and not only ranks number one in my list of Disney animations but is my favorite animated film by any studio even beating out the brilliant Spirited Away by Hayao Miyazaki. Disney's Peter Pan has an extremely tight, well paced story without a wasted frame or a scene that drags. The animation is bright, active and fluid. I would challenge fans of Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid to go back and watch those films again and compare them to Peter Pan which looks far better despite being almost 40 years their senior.<br /><br />When I was young I thought of Neverland as a literal place while at the same time removed from our reality. In other words it wasn't simply in the imagination of Wendy, John and Michael but was an actual location they flew to just not a place you could ever stumble across. The biggest complaints I've read about the movie is the use of broad stereotypes of Native Americans but in this case I always considered them more of an archetype of the childhood concept of an Indian rather than a real Native American tribe since they appear to live exclusively in Neverland. Likewise, despite Captain Hook's vow to sail away from Neverland it's hard to imagine his pirate crew existing anywhere else. I won't battle too hard over the usage of racial stereotypes but I really don't think it's a sufficient reason to discount the movie.<br /><br />Movies about children, written for children, tend to write children like small, overly clever adults. Peter Pan and the Lost Boys act like real children. They are impulsive, self centered and easily manipulated (ok, Peter is a bit more clever than the Lost Boys). When Hook captures the Lost Boys and seduces them with life as a pirate they gleefully rush to join. Even John and Michael trip over themselves to hop aboard. All loyalty to Pan seems gone. Likewise Peter has no problem nuzzling with Tiger Lily right in front of Wendy or laughing off when the mermaids attempt to drown her. When Tinker Bell convinces the Lost Boys to try and kill Wendy, Peter isn't angry over the attempted murder he's angry that Tink betrayed him. It's not that Peter has malice (although killing Hook doesn't seem to bother him a whit) it's that Peter is about Peter and even his refusal to grow up can be seen as a childish refusal to follow the rules of society and nature. What sets Peter apart is that when he decides not to grow up he literally does not grow up.<br /><br />Every character, even the peripheral ones like Big Chief and Tiger Lily, are wonderful. I could watch the interactions of Captain Hook and Smee all day long and although Hook is generally played for laughs he's no fool and cleverly manipulates Tinker Bell to reveal Pan's hideout. What I really love about the characters is their unapologetic amorality. This is not a film about life lessons or personal growth. It is simply a fantasy adventure that makes no attempt to moralize and I love it. Rottentomatos.com recently had a list of the 75 greatest animated movies and Peter Pan didn't even make the cut and holds a very good but not excellent aggregate score of 83%. I have no idea what movie 17% of reviewers saw but as I lifetime fan of animation Peter Pan is the one film I recommend everyone see. Ignore the naysayers.leefully rush to join.

What sets Peter apart is that when he decides not to grow up he literally does not grow up.<br /><br />Every character, even the peripheral ones like Big Chief and Tiger Lily, are wonderful. I could watch the interactions of Captain Hook and Smee all day long and although Hook is generally played for laughs he's no fool and cleverly manipulates Tinker Bell to reveal Pan's hideout. What I really love about the characters is their unapologetic amorality. This is not a film about life lessons or personal growth. It is simply a fantasy adventure that makes no attempt to moralize and I love it. Rottentomatos.com recently had a list of the 75 greatest animated movies and Peter Pan didn't even make the cut and holds a very good but not excellent aggregate score of 83%. I have no idea what movie 17% of reviewers saw but as I lifetime fan of animation Peter Pan is the one film I recommend everyone see. Ignore the naysayers.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|When I listened to this album the first time I was floored by the orchestration.  Of course, we haven't heard much from Nightwish for the past 4 or so years, but I think that it is fair to say that if you look at both bands since the inception of Epica, Jansen has been the better orchestrator.  Tuomas turns it all around with Imaginaeriom,<br />though.  This is a solid album and musically is Nightwish's best, in my opinion.  Anette is a fabulous vocalist when she is singing in her range, not Tarja's.  She does well on this album, but strains a lot in the high register.  Simone, doesn't have this problem, and I could only imagine a Nightwish fronted by Simone Simons (i.e., I find Marco's groaning a lot more tolerable than Jansen's and I tend to skip Epica tracks as soon as Jansen starts grunting).  Be that as it may, I love this album.  Since Epica's Requiem for the Indifferent gets released today, I think I'll check it out.  For now, Tuomas has won the symphonic metal scoring war.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We were ready to own all of the movies.  We didn't want anything fancy - just a set of the movies.  This was a great price for all of them in one set.  We had a marathon - watching one a night for 8 nights straight!

B0058VW36U|4.0|It's great but it  hasn't updated but otherwise its great and is fun for everyone and works great for my cruz velocity tablet can't wait for it to finally update
B0034G4P4Y|2.0|This interpretation on screen of Tintin, lacks the soul and depth of characters that Herge created as artist. When I read the books, I got a different picture of tintin's characters, Haddock's melodramatics. Tintin does one thing to you - it unifies you with a vision of world that Herge created, and teaches you to respect cultures and nations.<br /><br />Screen adaptation has a mellowed Haddock with passion, a tintin that is too serious for an adventure, and a story that is at heart of Tintin's adventure - ruined by slapstick stunts rather than being enamored by tintin's quick wits and Haddock's silly antics.<br /><br />In case, however, you have not been introduced to tintin through herge's picture books, please bear in mind you are watching a mindless stunt show, rather than being properly introduced to tintin.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Nice unit. After trying many FM transmitters over the years I've actually found one I really like. Everything else is mediocre. I put all my music on an old SD card. I no longer need to connect my phone - but I could - or a USB stick - or an MP3 player, whatever. With great audio quality.<br /><br />Really, this is easily worth the price here, especially compared to the features of other transmitters (they are generally featureless.) It is not perfect, but the Soundfly Aux is so far above everything else, there is nothing but good to say here.
0439023521|5.0|This book is well written and I eagerly anticipate the release of the movie. I am currently reading the third and final book in the trilogy and eagerly anticipate the conclusion of the series. Great Books!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love rlthalis app so much that I risk getting in trouble for.playing it!! :) 5 out of 5 stars! totally worth the money!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I guess that os ok Cu's u can play a whole bunch of games so I think it is pretty cool
B001R4MEUM|5.0|I won't review the album again here- its a work that has its fans and its detractors.  I have always loved its epic sprawl.  But anyone who likes this album and plays it regularly should get the new remaster.  All the 2009 Genesis remasters are vast improvements over the 1994 series.  They are much fuller and crisper sounding, making it feel like they could have been recorded last week.  This is especially noticeable in this album, which has always suffered from murky/muddy sound quality.  If you want to put this classic on, and feel like it is the work of an amazing new band that just came out, the 2009 remaster is for you!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This should be one of the first apps you download.  With one quick touch, I can see all Wi-Fi signals in my immediate area complete with signal strength and channel information.  No more searching for the strongest signal by trial and error.
B002LB13SE|1.0|This film opens slowly and seems to have some promise. Once it get's to the rape and murder it looks like it's going to be a hell of a ride, but once this happens it's pretty much really really tame compared to most films I have seen that are either remakes of classic disturbing films or originals. The acting is fairly decent, the music, production values and so fourth are all pretty good. Where the film falls very short is that it's not all that horrifying and even the unrated cut has scenes that while certainly disturbing to some degree are few and far between. Most of the revenge sequences run dry and there isn't much delivered that really shocks you. The movie seemed very tame compared to the original or movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hostel or even a movie liike the french zombie flick 'The Horde' which was much bloodier and much more scary, while not being any sort of classic. If you want something that delivers and gives some decent shocks try 'The Collector' or even something like 'Insidious' for the fear factor. This one was a huge dissapointment.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Worst customer support.  No phone number to call and over 24 hour response times to questions.  I have verizon FIOS as my internet provider and I got every DNS error under the sun.  Co couldn't figure out what to do and wouldn't call me on the phone to help so after 5 days and over 10 hours trying every which way to get this camera live on the network i have given up.  My advice for the company is if your going to try to be like apple and make apple type products at least try to offer some good support.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Kids just love it. They play it all the time. Details and Color. Are bright and very distantly placed. Its a nice app.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|ive been looking for this on my fire since I got it. I live this game. so addicting and fun. add me bralie5
B00457WZEI|5.0|If you have not seen the movie read the book first. It is a quick read and I guarantee it will keep your attention and even make you cry.I can't wait to read more books by Michael Morpurgo.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great for intl travel. lets me know the temps in Fahrenheit wherever I am, and to know what to expect before. I get there!
B006VREOOY|2.0|While this film is not all that bad and there is some pretty good action, it still leaves a great deal to be desired. For one thing it is nothing like the original which while also fairly forgettable, Sam Peckinpah did direct it with enough style to give it merit. In that version James Caan plays an Ex-CIA commando that is injured and must regain his mobility before he can resume his duties, Through a great deal of the film he's coping with his injuries and gaining new strategies in training. This film bares no resemblance at all with the original except where the title stands and the fact that the characters have job simularities. The trailer contains nearly every scene of action that is included in the film except maybe one I can think of. And when you know De Niro's name is connected with it and he's one of the main characters you really expect a good deal more. All in all it's a pretty familiar story and done a lot better in other films.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is coming out as a movie on the 23rd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So EXCITED!!!! The Book was great it had so much action. I kept saying to myself,\\"Okay Clare you are going to put the book down as soon as this parts over. But then I ca't help but keep reading because it has you addicted!You just can't STOP! In my opinion this book could surpass Harry Potter by alot! It is neither futuristic or in the presemce. It is romantic, but action packed. It is crazy! How does this author do it!?
0810993139|5.0|I had the entire series, up through Cabin Fever, but I found that the first book was missing.  Found it at a great price here and replaced it.  Now my collection is complete again.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|I read the book after watching the movie and falling in love with the soundtrack. Great book...I wish I had the nerve to do something so daring.
B006X9EUUS|5.0|(full disclosure) I've followed Sinead's career from \\"The Lion and the Cobra\\" since 1987.  Through her dark periods and the better ones.  She is a prolific artist.  Most of her albums were awe-inspiring.  A couple were crap. One or two were mediocre with a few great tracks inside. Thanks to \\"listen before you buy\\" you can figure this out for yourself quickly on Amazon.  Listen to this album. You will not be disappointed. This one shows her returning to her former great stature. If you're a newcomer to her form, you may find yourself as enthralled as I was upon hearing her breakout.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book is the first of three in the series.  It was a little hard to keep interest for the first 100 pages, but I understand that it was setting the scene for the entire series.  Friends who had already read it told me when I got through the first 100 pages, it would capture me.  And it did!  What a dynamic book!
0345522478|4.0|After reading the reviews on this book I thought I'd give it a go.  Not a huge fan of contemporary fantasy, but what the hey.  Thoroughly enjoyed the entire series.  Didn't really need any of the republican slights, but they were sparse and progressives can't seem to help themselves.<br /><br />After reading Erikson, Martin, etc. this is a refreshingly original, often humorous and un-stressful adventure.  Do not hesitate to dig in.
1416550550|5.0|This book was a winter weekend book for me. I did my chores and hunkered down with it on a friday afternoon and reluctantly faced the real world again on Monday morning. I often do that, but usually have regrets/guilt over all that I ignored.  Definitely not with this book though.<br /><br />It has remained in my thoughts though I finished it quite a while ago. And though the ending was very satisfying (no loose ends), I was sad to get there because I cared so much for the characters. Well, a couple of them. That brother was pretty sick.
1400097029|1.0|I just reread this book for a book club having read it first when it won the Booker.  For me it hasn't improved.  Having lost a husband at an early age I understand the need of going back in your life in order to go forward.  However, the book isn't really about the death of the wife and coping with that as much as it is about his own obsession with one family from his past.  At less than 200 pages it feels longer - and why are the two surprises held to the very end in Agatha Christie-like fashion.  It's as if he himself knew that these issues would not be developed and he just threw them in.  I guess 6 years ago I didn't want to not like a Booker Prize winner. Now it's the norm.  Such flowery writing - such obscure words which add up to nothing much.  Why bother put the daughter in the story?  And the sea allusion at the very end is so hokey it made me laugh.  Better late than never, I guess, to make that connection of story to title.  Can't wait to hear the upcoming discussion at the meeting.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Good book. I have enjoyed all the books from this author. I would suggest a nice beach read. Definitely isn't mind challenging. It was an easy fun read. I recommend.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Overall the game is a blast. I cant think of any real knocks against the game. The puzzle level is never too hard (unlike Angry Birds that can be frustrating) and though it will at times test your brain its never frustrating. The graphics are fun and the concept is very cool. Definitely worth the cheap price. Great on Kindle Fire
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved this book.  This particular series of 3 books were recommended to me from some of my close friends and this particular book (book 2) in the series kept me in suspense every minute.  Great book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun times. the games are fun, all very different and there are tons of them. good way to pass the time.
0061537969|5.0|We are constantly on the lookout for books for our book club that appeal to everybody in our group.  This one definitely fit the bill.  The more I read, the more I wanted to read.  What a great way to showcase how wonderful our animals are to us, their humans, and how they can really help us in more ways than we can ever imagine.  I think I've told everybody that has ever read a book about this amazing story and I purchased a copy for my dad and he couldn't put it down either.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My 3 year old LOVE these! We just received them and she helped me put them up in her room. They look amazing on her walls and she had so much fun helping me put them up. Obviously I helped with the larger stickers, but she helped with the little flowers, birds, gems and butterflies that came with this, and we also got the set with all the fairytale sayings and she helped put those up, as well.<br />These come off the wall to reposition easily, but they seem to stick really well to the wall once you have them placed. They were very easy to use/apply and even repositioning them didn't cause any problems. She told me where she wanted the princesses and I placed them while she did all of the smaller pieces wherever she liked; she had a blast! What else allows a 3 year old to decorate their OWN room without having to worry about them getting hurt or damaging something?<br />The only thing I do want to mention is that these aren't perfectly cut the whole way around, so be really careful when pulling them off the backing or you might tear the sticker rather than the perforation. This is especially true for the larger pieces, but if you loosen the edges first everything seems to separate from the backing really easily and without damage or creasing.<br />We live in military housing, so decorating and personalizing her room can be a challenge but these were a very affordable, fun solution that I am very pleased with and no damage to the walls; in base housing that is so important!<br />I cannot attest to how well they stay on the walls over extended periods of time or whether or not length of time will make it so they damage the walls upon removal, but based on my experience with them so far they stick well without leaving residue or damaging the paint.<br />I definitely recommend this for a child's room!
B00536OCZA|5.0|We received our brand new Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon vinyl album and it was just perfect.  It is the ultimate topper to any rock album collection.  We were very pleased with the packaging, so that the album was not damaged in any way during shipping.  Would definitely purchase from here again.
0882709194|5.0|hello....i find that to embrace any of the worlds religions is a form of mental illness...a means to deal with death...why would some people have the need to think there is some kind of god floating around the universe that will answer their prayers or heal the sick....i find it disturbing that people around the world would kill each other because one believes in a different religion,when in fact,they are all just  made up stories....they are not killing each other over oil,or borders,or something that is real...just made up stories that have been past down through the ages...when you read the bible,have you ever wondered why all the stories are about life in the sand countries??? thats because they were all written by man,and at the time the world was still considered to be flat...if there was a god while these stories were written, wouldnt he of made known the fact that the world was round,and the authors had much more area that they could incorperate into their stories????if a person lived on earth named jesus,i believe at the time he was just like martin luther king...he had his own ideals which were different than the government at the time...he was able to asemble large masses,and sway peoples beliefs...this did not go well with the powers that be,so,like king he was killed...the deciples knew that if his body was still in the tomb after 3 days,the government would kill them also for being part of a conspericy,so they rolled the stone away themselves and buried the body someplace else...this they thought would add credence to the story,but over time they were all killed anyway...remember,the most profitable business in the world is not microsoft or oil....its the jesus business....I think everyone that has any kind of thought should read Charles Darwin's book...hopefully it will make you think...if you follow the fossil records of earth,you will find that very little of whats written in the bible could of ever happened.....
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Bought this Sony just for turntable purposes.  Totally satisfied with its performance.  Very easy to assemble and use.  Compact and simple.  Excellent sound.
1416575464|5.0|This book is fabulous. It gives me great ideas for my own home. Don't read it as if you have to follow it step by step. It's more of an inspirational book - as in - Oh! Neat idea! Now, how can I make it fit into my home with my own tastes....
1400069289|4.0|We are creatures of habit. And control of those habits, by ourselves or another, can be the key to extraordinary, even world-changing, power.<br /><br />Charles Duhigg presents readers with this key - \\"Cue - Routine - Reward\\". He then goes on to expound on the power of habit, and its impact in an extraordinary range of applications, from the selling of toothpaste to the founding of AA to changing the culture at Alcoa to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The ultimate message, however, is in the power that control of our habits can give us over ourselves.<br /><br />I found this book to be very readable, and very interesting. Some of the discussions in the latter parts of the book do stretch a bit to fit into the \\"habit\\" message (the cases are interesting, but suffer from the \\"when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail\\" problem). But they stand as worthwhile stories on their own. The book is more inspiration than perspiration, however, so if you were looking for a step-by-step guide, this isn't it.<br /><br />Readers with a background in Psychology, NLP, or any of a number of other disciplines will find familiar concepts here under different names - the author doesn't use words like \\"priming\\" \\"reinforcement\\" or \\"anchor\\", but that's what's going on. NTTAWWT.
B005UG542S|5.0|we love all the harry potter movies and books..this is a great movie and has a wonderful ending to sum up the adventures
B004L3AQFG|5.0|The Movie got here in good shape and time. We really like the Movie for it is based on a true story and gets your head to thinking about what you would do if something like this happened to you!
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is in my opinion bigger, bolder, and just plain better than the first one. That is saying a lot considering I loved the first one. Where the first one had some formula to it this one seems off the rails. This is one of the rare middle parts to a trilogy that isn't just a place holder for the next one. Consider myself blown away.
B002JCSRKC|5.0|I am a dog groomer and I have been looking for a rainboot that was comfortable and wouldn't leak on me. I stand on my feet all day, and I am very rough on my boots. I have had these boots for about a month now (working 5 days a week and wearing them everytime) and they have been great. They are the cutest, sturdiest and most comfortable and leak proof boots I have had in a long time.
B002ZG99CM|5.0|I didn't plan to see this movie, but the previews drew me in. It's inspiring for all ages, but what I like most is that it's inspiring for children. We need more movies like this!
1576875776|5.0|This book was a delightful window into world of photography and the fascinating person who took the pictures.  Loved it!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved the trilogy - it was a wonderful adventure. However, this publisher only allows you to share the book once for 14 days. I wish I could share it with more people so that I we could talk about it (biggest disadvantage to this e-book).
B0072X2O66|5.0|In all the reviews the expected comparisons to Dream Theater and Symphony X are the reasons this album is getting low marks. Nowhere did the band state, however, that this was a progressive style album or band. As a matter of fact, those who follow Portnoy on Twitter would know that the intent of this band and album is just to be straight up in your face aggressive Hard Rock & Metal. Stop with the bashing because this isn't progressive because it was never intended to be.<br /><br />Sometimes musicians like to do a side project (or supergroup) that is a little different from their normal style  and that is ok. Look at the differences between Slipknot and Stone Sour, or Alter Bridge and Creed, etc. to see what I mean. The side projects are not meant to sound like the bands they came from. Most of the time the musicians will go out of their way to distance the sound from their other bands. Just read recent interviews with Mark Tremonti (Creed, Alter Bridge, Tremonti Project) to see what I mean. He explains how he tries very hard to vary his style between his 3 bands. Accept this as the direction that the band is going with Adrenaline Mob. It isn't going to sound like Symphony X or Dream Theater because it isn't supposed to!<br /><br />At it's core this album is amazing when you accept the fact that it is supposed to be in your face Hard Rock and Metal. \\"Undaunted\\" and the cover of Duran Duran's \\"Come Undone\\" stand out as truly the best songs on the album (at least from my first few listens). Lzzy Hale from Halestorm is AMAZING on \\"Come Undone\\" as well.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for progressive, look elsewhere. If you are looking for an amazing, in your face Hard Rock/Metal album, you will love this!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've only tried one spider solitaire app (this one) so I can't compare but this app has a good interface and gameplay so I don't see a reason to try anything else.
B0065Y3SB8|5.0|I am loving this album people can talk about it all that they want to but her voice is amazing \\"Who You Are\\" and \\"Domino\\" are my favorite I am definately looking forward to seeing things from her in the future!!!!
1433502410|5.0|love this bible! so much great background and information! only negative part is that it's rather heavy for a petite person like me. otherwise, awesome!
B0034G4P8A|1.0|I must say that as a fan of the origonal commics this movie was a let down and then some.  They are saping all the myth and magic from Marvel and turning it into a generic sci fi universe.  Not only did they stray so far from the source material it is barely recognizable (not uncommon for commic book movie adaptations sadly) but the acting and plot are pure cheeze (and not in a good campy commic book sorta way).  Anyway if you like the commics avoid, if you want to see a stargate norse gods rip off feel free to pick this one up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Glad I purchased this book.<br />Well written, keeps me interested as to what's next.<br />Looking forward to the next book in the series.
B0015DROBO|5.0|From the beginning I found this book hard to put down.  Of course I saw the movie but was so glad I read the book first.  The night I finished this book I downloaded the next one.  Good Read.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Perfect deal, faster shipment, recommended to all, A++++++++<br />I made a comparison with similar and for me this was the best choice and the purchase was great
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun game trying to reach the goals, but a change in scenery would be nice. Three or four scenes would be nice. Perhaps more options in the shop, too.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I enjoy the music and solving the puzzles. The puzzles sometimes are very simple to solve and sometimes they require a lot of thought.  After playing this game I purchased the first Quell.
0439023483|5.0|I have to say that I was a bit skeptical about this book when ever it became the \\"it\\" thing. I figured that it was just another teen fad like Harry Potter or Twilight. Much to my surprise the book blew me out of the water and I finished it the day it was delivered. The first chapter was a bit confusing and slow for me, but after that I couldn't out it down. I also like that it's such an easy read and it isn't to complex with made io language or objects.
B000J3OTTQ|3.0|Well the item arrived in about 5 days wich was good. The movie was brand new and seemed to be in good condition. The only thing is that when i played it it got stuck several times, i checked the disk and noticed it was a bit scratched from some areas. I dont think the movie was scratched since the beginning. It was shipped in a padded envelope and i think the disk must have been rubbing against the box during the whole shipping/delivery process. So i just wish it had been shipped in a small box.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the 3rd book in the series and brings all the characters together.  I have a great like for this series and find that after I have completed one book I am drawn more into the next book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have tried so many electronic Bible apps only to be frustrated with their poor design. Well, this app I truly love. There are so many ways to interact with it, a truly one size fits all. I do thank God for leading the developers of this app as it is a marvelous tool in learning more about our Father, His Son and His Spirit. Thank you and may God bless you.
B0072X2O66|1.0|Horrible....totally disappointing all hype and no substance play once and it will surely gather dust. Nothing new or interesting all the songs sound like they have been done by other bands before.
B0061S073A|4.0|This. app is nice because it keeps all the games for my kids in one place. The only draw back I have is that I have to keep resetting the lock key. Which is pretty minor.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|What captured me in this book was the characters. None of them are purely good or evil, but they are all human. The world could be any standard medieval world with a bit of magic added, but the characters make it come alive.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Just cannot get enough of the series.  The second is everybit as good as the first.  Can't put it down.
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|This is an album that requires several listenings before making a final judgement.  There are songs that I didn't care for on my first listen, but now I love.  Like \\"You've Got It\\".  And \\"Rocky Ground\\" is so haunting that I get chills every time I hear it!!  I CANNOT wait to see Bruce and the E Street Band (although Clarence will be missed) on March 28th in Philadelphia.  I am hoping they cover a lot of the songs on this CD.  It is such an ode to the times we are living.  If you've never bought a Bruce CD, this would be a good one to see a different side to the Boss!!!!
0385344228|5.0|This is my second book by William Landay and I enjoyed it immensely.  My first book by him was Mission Flats, which was just okay.  I thought it was a little too masculine for my taste.  But Defending Jacob was just right.  It was not too \\"rough\\" to read and he kept just enough characters and events that made it easier to follow than Mission Flats.<br /><br />From a female point of view, I didn't see much \\"romance\\" in the book, which was okay as I did enjoy the criminal aspect of it.<br /><br />Although I did see the ending coming, there were enough twists in the story that made the book a real page turner.<br /><br />I did have a slight technical problem about Jacob's diagnoses but there was enough explanation in the book about the bases of the diagnoses, so I let it go.  There were also some other little things that made me question the reality of them (for example, can't they obtain an email that Jacob supposedly sent to his friend, rather than just relying on the kid's words?), but overall the story was believable and makes you wonder what you would have done, if you were in their shoes.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book and read it faster than I wanted to (I wanted to read it during my vacation but once I started reading, I couldn't put it down)!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool game for passing time and getting nothing done, one thing is for sure, I will.not buy points for real dollars when I can keep playing the game for more. good game overall.

0545265355|1.0|Ok, so the first book is great and reels you in.  Great characters, excitement, adventure, romance, and well written so that you feel like you are right there with Katniss and Peeta.  The second book is not so great.  The adventure is gone, the excitement with it, and the romance is mass confusion.  I originally chalked up the second book being so-so to it being a build up for the third book.  Wow, was I disappointed. The third book seems to take the rest of the story and cut out huge pieces to make it fit into one book.  Characters change completely, unbelievably, and though the author attempts to pull it all together in the end, gaping holes are left. Large pieces of time are left out due to \\"blackouts\\" and injuries and new characters suddenly take over with little introduction.<br /><br />Maybe, if the story had been over another 2-3 books and things were explained I could rate this set higher. Unfortunately, I went from loving the story to wishing I hadn't wasted my time.

It was rude of me to judge but I did not expect this from a reality tv star on MTV. Great advice and lets you use your own fashion sense/style but lets you know the basic rules. Part on accessories, hair and make up were also very good. BUY IT!! GREAT READ!

B004SYP5WC|3.0|The app does what it says with a minimum of fuss.  No excessive whistles and bells from an overzealous designer throwing in everything they think might be cool.  I really only have a few nits that can be addressed with ease:<br />1 - no way to review all of your reminders - once recurrent reminders are marked paid they are not visible again until the next cycle triggers.<br />2 - The camera on my Atrix 4G was either not recognized or the camera functions are missing.<br />3 - A default repeat time of one day is stupid.  I accidentally saved a reminder with one day default and ended up with a page full of reminders that had to be deleted one by one.  Make it a month please.<br />4 - Maybe silly but in the case of a credit card the amount of the payment varies.  It would be nice to see that as a reminder to check the balance - not some bogus amount that probably doesn't reflect reality.<br />5 - a way to \\"pause\\" a reminder.  Perhaps my credit card is paid off and I don't need to be reminded for a while.<br />Thanks for a straightforward app - I hope you can see to improve the small things.

B003UESJEM|3.0|This movie is too much like real life when things are not going well. It is a deeply depressing reminder that sometimes, people lose their jobs through no fault of their own, and the repercussions can ruin lives.<br /><br />Although I think the topic is unfortunately very, very pertinent to today (2012), it was kind of like watching a very sobering and downer news report of the economy tanking.  The acting is first-rate, the story interesting, but ultimately, the movie was so real, it was not much of an excuse for entertainment.  If I want real, I will watch the evening news or maybe a Michael Moore documentary.  (I know, I know, movies can be about \\"real life\\" and still be quite good.  I just was not in the mood to be reminded how bad the unemployment situation is.)

B006UG90RM|5.0|I've heard enough early Van Halen albums from the David Lee Roth-era to confidentially say that \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" stands up well to -- and perhaps even exceeds -- the work from that period. Who would have thought that VH in 2012, with Roth at the helm, would have made such a cool, musically stellar CD? From the opening layered vocals of the zany-sounding \\"Tattoo\\" to the crushing guitar work on the encore-worthy closer \\"Beats Workin,'\\" the guys in VH methodically and successfully moved past demons and grudges to create an album truly worth waiting for. While it may not contain a mega-pop-hit monster like \\"Jump,\\" \\"Truth's\\" sturdily built songs rock out as if the in-your-face Roth never went away.<br /><br />It's probably not a consciously done thing, but party-boy David Lee Roth brings a naturally darker, more tarnished musical vibe to Van Halen that's been missing for too long. This mood comes across through his low-drone, off-the-cuff grumbles that run amuck on \\"Truth\\"; his surprisingly sharp lyrics that cover lightweight subjects and somehow ring so true; and in his overall approach, a weird mix of intensity and casualness toward his craft that seems to rub off on the other guys. When Roth is running the show things just seem edgier somehow -- and I like that feel for this band. Diamond Dave remains the clownish showman who likes to surprise, and from top to bottom he doesn't disappoint on this CD. The guy is a true wordsmith, a good-time folksy poet who simply gets off on life. His lyrics and speedy vocal work on the country-blues song \\"Stay Frosty,\\" for instance, are loose, original and fun -- elements that are missing from the by-the-numbers, over-coached singers heard nowadays on glossy TV talent shows.<br /><br />Thankfully there's no letdown on the background vocals with Michael Anthony out of the picture. And Eddie Van Halen's sustained and sizzling guitar solos on each song don't indicate a musician on the decline, which many thought was the case prior to this CD. Some may disagree, but I feel that \\"Truth\\" contains a fuller, more realized and robust sound than some of Van Halen's early records. It's the type of sound that's right at home within any decade, always the sign of a classic, timeless band.prior to this CD.

B0064NTZJO|3.0|This review is just for the Blu-Ray. The film itself is fantastic.<br /><br />I was pretty dismayed to pop this baby in and find 7 ads and trailers before I actually got to the menu. And when you get to the menu, there's a nice pop-up ad in the corner advertising upcoming Blu-Ray releases. Not done tastefully at all.<br />The content itself is fine. Contains a few nice special features. But I guess the studio didn't make enough on this when it was in theaters and now has to litter it with ads.

B004EYT932|4.0|The book deals with several forgotten financial crashes of the past. It presents a very good review of past mistakes, and it also shows how the whole sistem is prone to repeat those mistakes. The motto of the book should be engraved on every contract, on every financial deal, and every bank of the world. The authors show, once and for all, that if a deal seems too good to be true, than it is quite probably a very bad deal.
B005QVUZIU|5.0|If you've loved the movie as much as I did, which is to a feverish pitch, you'll definitely love this soundtrack. This is a lively and exciting collection, and it is a tantalizing way to relive the very memorable grand adventure of Puss in his first solo movie. If you haven't seen the movie, and opt to buy this soundtrack first, it would still make a fine addition to any music or movie soundtrack enthusiast's collection. The music of Puss in Boots is very distinct and it portrays Puss's personality and his story perfectly! in every riff and beat; without at all sounding mundane or nondescript, as most orchestra-centric soundtracks these days tend to sound. The upbeat dance tracks are especially delightful, and they compliment the other tracks which go from suspenseful, to heart-wrenching, to slow and pleasantly ambient, even almost lulling, but still, never losing its' personality and stays engaging, passionate, fun-filled & endearing, and is really an overall \\"feel good\\" experience, just as the movie is, from start to finish. I guess the only thing that left me wanting is that the catchy song towards the end of the movie that segued to the end credits is not included here, and I was really looking forward to having that song too, as it is part of the Puss in Boots soundtrack after all. Still, it's a very good buy, and a must-have for all Puss in Boots lovers out there!<br /><br />The Soundtrack Of Puss In Boots includes 24 tracks, composed by Henry Pryce Jackman, featuring Rodrigo Y Gabriela. Excluding the song at the end of the movie at the beginning of the end credits, which is entitled \\"Americano\\" by Lady Gaga.
030746363X|5.0|This book is awesome.  I've used it to put on muscle and cut fat.  I'm also trying out some of the other protocols.<br /><br />As for putting on muscle, I was able to put on 6 pounds of solid muscle in 45 days following one of the protocols in the book.  I was only about 60% efficient in following the protocol as well.  If I was following it 100%, I imagine, I would have put on between 8-10.  Everyone in my life noticed the results and were stunned.  I actually did a before and after DEXA scan to measure my results as accurately as possible.  I'm what people would have called a 'hardgainer'.  I've always been thin and always had a hard time putting on muscle no matter what I tried.<br /><br />This book is very well organized.  Don't be overwhelmed my the size of the book.  It's designed to be read quickly, in parts, depending on your goals.<br /><br />All together, The Four Hour Body, has served as a launch pad for me to start experimenting safely and mastering my body.  I couldn't be happier with Tim Ferris, the book, and my results! :)
0345528581|5.0|Great book.  I don't agree 100% with the book and his ideas but to summarize what I believe and how I used this book:  I use the following excercises in my full body circuit training in the gym:<br />1. Pull ups<br />2. Push ups.  I use the squat rack that has guide rails.  I start standing straight up than I lower the bar each time till it's at it's lowest level, than put a free weight bench behind me and my feet on it and do a push up this way with the bar.  It feels better on my wrists.<br />3. Let me ups. best back workout.  lay on ground, put hands straight up on a bar and pull your self up.  see book for more details.<br />4. Squats.<br /><br />I find it funny that this guy doesn't believe in free weights but they would make his life a lot easier than using phone books etc for weights.<br /><br />Combine this with your circuit training (3x a week) and High intensity cardio interval training on a stationary bike (3x a week) = perfect workout.
0525478817|5.0|Oh. My. God. The Fault in Our Stars is so freaking amazing. There are no words to describe it. I knew I was going to love it, since John Green is one of my favorite authors, and everything about The Fault in Our Stars looked amazing, but wow. It exceeded my higher-than-high expectations. I don't even know what to say - nothing I could write could ever show how truly amazing this book is.<br /><br />John Green's style is unique, so, so great. He conveys his awesome sense of humor in his writing - you can't not laugh at least once while reading a John Green book. His writing is serious, too, though, emotional, thought-provoking and just plain beautiful. This book is the perfect mixture between literary and entertaining - you want to read it as fast as possible to find out what happens; but at the same time, you want to savor every sentence and never let the book end. John Green can make you laugh, cry and think about the meaning of life all within one page.<br /><br />Hazel is such a great MC. I was a little worried about John writing from a girl's POV for the first time, but it worked perfectly. Hazel's sense of humor and her way of thinking are unique and interesting. I loved her from the first page on.<br /><br />And then there's Augustus. Oh, Augustus. Even his name is amazing. When I first read the name Augustus, I thought it was weird and kind of ugly, and now... Augustus Waters has to be the hottest name ever invented. And that's just his name - the actual person is even better. Augustus is unlike anyone I've ever read about - there's no way to describe him, he's just perfect - he's perfect without being perfect, which is the best kind of perfect. Hazel and Augustus are adorable together. The way they treat each other is so sweet, and their bantering is hilarious.<br /><br />The plot is tragic - I cried loads while reading The Fault in Our Stars. But it's awesome and crazy and fun, too - I loved everything Hazel and Augustus do together, everything about An Imperial Affliction, just... everything.<br /><br />I can't even think of anything more to say - The Fault in Our Stars is too perfect for me to adequately express my love for it. My favorite of John's Green books, by far. With quirky, unique and lovable characters, writing that is somehow hilarious, entertaining, literary, thought-provoking and emotional, all wrapped in one, The Fault in Our Stars is a beautiful portrayal of what it means to be alive. It makes me want to never read any other book, and just reread this one over and over again.
1612130283|1.0|The success of this book baffles me. While I am not an avid reader of \\"erotic fiction,\\" I have read some, and everything that I've read is so much better than this, it's ridiculous. If you're contemplating buying this book, here's what the book is, if this helps you make a decision:<br />- Take Stephenie Meyer's ham-handed, awkward writing and turn down the \\"quality\\" dial about four - maybe five - notches. Romance novel readers can look at it this way - the writing is about two levels worse than the worst Harlequin romance you've ever read.<br />- Add in a Stephenie Meyer-esque heroine, a woman so boring it is hard to imagine how anyone - much less an extremely rich, sophisticated, smart, experienced dominant - would ever see anything the least bit interesting in her. Just like Bella in the Twilight novels, Anastasia is mostly just a cipher, a complete blank that women can project themselves onto. She's not that smart, she's not that funny, she has very pedestrian beliefs, goals and ambitions, she has standard mommy-didn't-love-me and divorced-parent issues. Actually, Anastasia is Bella, just this time around she gets into sex.<br />- Add in some clumsily-written sex scenes and a whole lot of mostly inaccurate, overblown information about BDSM. Then couch the sex scenes in a whole lot of very boring dialogue and \\"plot\\" (mainly consisting of the main characters' emails to each other - is there anything more boring than reading someone else's emails?) so there can at least be a pretense that there is a story here, and that the book isn't just bad BDSM erotica.<br />Part of my problem with the book is the poor quality, including everything I've mentioned above. My other main problem with the book is just how unbelievable the story and the characters are. There are very few experienced doms out there who get involved with uninitiated subs this way. There are very few doms with Christian's resources that have to resort to uninitiated partners, no matter how \\"fascinating\\"(not) they are - they can pretty much purchase as much experience and expertise in their partners as they need, and generally, they need and want a lot of experience - bringing someone up to their level takes time and effort and becomes boring pretty quickly. I would actually caution women who might be interested in this kind of arrangement with a dominant, now that they've read the book - experienced doms who look for uninitiated subs do not usually have good intentions of bringing someone along into the lifestyle slowly, and buying them cars and computers. It's something people should steer clear of, not seek out.<br />I don't know. I guess if this gets some housewives hot and bothered and spices up their bedroom life, there's no harm in it. Husbands everywhere will probably get some awesome experiences out of this whole temporary BDSM-lite erotic-fiction craze. But, the really tragic thing is that there are authors of erotic fiction out there, who have been working for a long time, who actually have - you know - WRITING SKILLS - who will never be as rich or as famous as the woman who wrote this very lackluster book that is getting all kinds of unwarranted attention, for no good reason.<br />If readers of this are really interested in this whole BDSM erotic-fiction thing, without the thinly-veiled, poorly-constructed romance subtext, I highly recommend the Sleeping Beauty series that Anne Rice wrote under a pen name, A.N. Roquelaure. The first one, The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, is available for Kindle here on Amazon. It's much better written, overall, than this book, and also much more creative (and thus, much hotter).

The artwork and inserts for the set are very nice. The box set includes many songs (most of which are very excellent.) Good luck buying a new one of these. They are quite expensive. I got mine today and have been listening to it frequently. It is a very smart and unique packaged box set. This is a must buy!

Her beautiful writing swept me into the story, making me feel as if I were standing right next to Sophia.<br /><br />If you are looking for a new twist on vampires and shifters, look no further.  Hamilton's mythology is unique and intriguing.  This is a must read for paranormal fantasy readers.  It even has a healthy dose of romance, which I always love.<br /><br />Rebecca Hamilton has a made forever fan of me.

1878424319|5.0|This book definitely holds the key to four agreements that will change your life forever: Be impeccable with your word, Don't take anything personally, Don't make assumptions, and Always do your best.  If we can just manage to do these four things, what a different life many of us would live.  What's hardest for most of us is breaking the \\"old agreements\\" that we've made with ourselves without even knowing it.  Agreements that we've accepted as our own truth passed down from generation to generation. Social agreements that we've accepted and adopted from others, that keep us bound to someone else's dream. I finished this little book knowing that it's okay to break every agreement that doesn't lend itself to my being able to experience my personal \\"Heaven on Earth.\\"  Read this book and gain an understanding of the only four agreements that need to be a constant in your life.

B006UG90RM|5.0|When I first heard Tattoo and Shes The Women (off of the 1976 Zero Album)I was thinking, is that all these guys have left! But you know what, it was my old cynical self trying to be negative and find fault. However after listening to this CD about 500 times since I bought it last month I can honestly say this is the best VH music in a long time and it is now in my top 3 all time VH albums.<br /><br />Although DLR can't do the Seagull anymore he more than makes up for it with dead on lyrics (\\"When was the last time, You did something for the first time\\") and growls like the Wolfman. EVH guitar work is at an all time best and the solos are spot on. AVH drumming is out of this world especially on tracks 4-6. No need for more cowbell with AVH on the kit.<br /><br />The big surprise on the CD was Wolfgang on the bass. I thought in 2007 he was a novelty brought along by dad to keep it in the family. But he really brings it now. There is some serious powerpunch in the basslines and his background singing although not quite as high as Michael Anthony, Wolfgang holds his own. I think Wolfie brings a younger feel to the band and it shows in the speed and power of the middle tracks. All in all if you don't like this CD I would be shocked. Make sure you play it often and loud and I guarantee you will be putting it in your top 3 like I have. What a great CD guys.

B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter introduces Jeff Lindsay's anti-hero, alliteration-prone serial killer Dexter Morgan. Dexter works for the Miami police department and, in his spare time, kills criminals that slip through the cracks in order to satisfy his bloodlust. When exsanguinated body parts start showing up around Tiamiami, Dexter develops a bit of a man-crush on his rival killer, and soon it looks like the Tiamiami Slasher has developed an equally strong attachment to our narrator. DDD is ripe with black humor and bolstered by a fun protagonist and is an overall enjoyable read despite clunky plot mechanics and a poorly-executed denouement.<br /><br />Most people will come to this book for the same reason I did, because it was the basis for the wildly popular Showtime series \\"Dexter\\", and if you've seen the first season of that show, then you know the plot of this book. After this installment, the two continuities diverge, but the differences here are worth going into. There are quite a few subplots added to pad out the series (the book is probably only about 70-80,000 words translated into thirteen hours of television), and a major motivating factor in the book was excised from the series. [MILD SPOILER WARNING] The book plays with an unreliable-narrator element that turns out to be a red herring, but it leads me to believe that Jeff Lindsay really, really liked Fight Club. [END SPOILERS]<br /><br />But the biggest difference is that the TV series is highly sanitized. The Miami PD of the show is hard-working and familial. The Dexter Morgan of the show is conflicted and adorably awkward. The world of the books is bleak and cynical. In fact, the most endearing thing about the book to me was the subtext. The world seen through Dexter's eyes is dysfunctional. The police are too engaged in politics to get around to solving murders--in the book, Detective LaGuerta is a genuinely ineffective police officer. Dexter is quick to point out how normal people are monstrous, citing everything from crimes of passion to horrific traffic to the \\"cheerfully homicidal mayhem\\" of professional hockey. There are no likable characters, no competent officials, no one who does anything of any esteem.<br /><br />It's important to Dexter that the world be this way, because it justifies his continued existence. Unlike the Dexter of the TV show, Lindsay's Dexter is fully aware and accepting of his monstrous nature. He doesn't want to be human, because he abhors humans. He doesn't just kill people--he tortures them to death. He occasionally forgets himself in the narration and refers to a person as \\"it\\". And yet all this bleakness still manages to work, thanks to the carefully rehearsed charm of the narrator. In fact, my favorite moment reading this was not plot-related, but the realization that the narrator's charm was phony, a function of the character. I had been duped, just like everyone else.<br /><br />My biggest complaint has to be the ending. Plot-wise it worked, but Lindsay traded in any sense of closure for a gotcha moment, which felt cheap and left me confused. I had to read the Epilogue twice to be sure of what had happened, and even then it was unclear how the final conflict had resolved. Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I thought that this item was well worth the price.  I paid a very fair price and I received a more than fair product.  I truly enjoyed both the audio and video the Blue-Ray had to offer.  Furthermore, I really,really, enjoyed the story line to this movie.  I think it is a fresh start to a whole new X-Men series of movies!!!  Can't Wait!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I find I'm spending way too much time playing the game on my kindle. I like that it doesn't mind if I'm connected to a network. the intuitive moves are frequently what I would choose, and it doesn't have a problem when I drag the cards to another stack.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Game of Thrones, for those that do not know, is based on a novel written by George R.R. Martin, who was proclaimed by Time magazine as the modern day Tolkien.  Being so highly acclaimed it came as no surprise it soon found its way into a film adaptation.  Fantasy has never been one to be very good on film due to its need of a ridiculous budget to make it look well produced versus a B movie from the 80s.  However, I can say without hesitation this is one of the best adapations I have ever seen.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is set in a fantasy world, but it is simply a backdrop to a very human story.  The entire series is character driven, each coming from different cultures, all playing for power to rule on the iron throne.  Violence, sex, love and political intrigue this series has it all.  L.A. Times describes this series as a medieval version of The Sopranos and it comes pretty close to that description.  I will spare you the in depth synopsis since it is complicated to say the least and would only spoil it for anyone viewing this for the first time.  I suggest everyone reading the first book to fully enjoy this series, but if you don't please watch all bonus material that has to do with the characters and setting on these great blu rays before starting episode 1.<br /><br />Game of Thrones Blu Ray set is the definitive way to watch this series.  First, for those that have not read the book can easily get a brief history lesson in the world and the characters that inhabit it.  The Blu Rays are simply put reference quality.  This is a 5 star set with flawless picture quality and an incredibly immersive 5.1 DTS Master HD sound track.  To top it all off you are not simply getting just the episodes which is so common with TV series sets.  You also get this long list of extras as well:<br /><br />- Complete Guide to Westeros - \\"An interactive compendium of the noble houses and lands featured in Season One.\\"<br />- Making \\"Game of Thrones\\" - \\"An exclusive 30-minute feature including never-before-seen footage from the set and  interviews from the cast and crew.\\"<br />- Character Profiles - \\"Profiles of 15 major characters as described by the actors portraying them.\\"<br />- Creating the Show Open - \\"An inside look at the creation of the Emmy-winning opening title sequence for 'Game of Thrones'.\\"<br />- From the Book to the Screen - \\"Executive producers David Benioff & D.B. Weiss and author George R.R. Martin talk about the challenges of bringing Martin's epic fantasy novel to life on HBO.\\"<br />- The Night's Watch - \\"An in-depth look at the unique order of men who patrol and protect the Wall, a 700-foot ice structure that separates the Seven Kingdoms from the darkness beyond.\\"<br />- Creating the Dothraki Language - \\"An insightful glance into the comprehensive language created for the Dothraki people in 'Game of Thrones'.\\"<br />- Audio Commentaries - \\"Seven audio commentaries with Cast and Crew including David Benioff, D.B. Weiss, George R.R. Martin, Emilia Clarke, Peter Dinklage, Kit Harington, and more.\\"<br />- Blu-ray Complete Guide to Westeros - \\"An interactive compendium of the noble houses and lands featured in Season One PLUS 24 exclusive histories of the Seven Kingdoms as told by the characters themselves.\\"<br />- In-Episode Guide - \\"In-feature resource that provides background information about on-screen characters, locations, and relevant histories while each episode plays.<br />- Anatomy of an Episode - \\"An in-episode experience that explores the creative minds and colossal efforts behind Episode Six, `A Golden Crown.'\\"<br />- Hidden Dragon Eggs - \\"Find the hidden dragon eggs to uncover even more never-before-seen content.\\"<br /><br />That is a HUGE list of extras that should excite anyone buying this incredible series.  Do not think this series is just for fans of the books or for fans of this genre of film, this is an incredible story that everyone should experience.  This Blu Ray set comes not only Highly Recommended butas a must own.

0312945973|2.0|Uh.....  Well....  (Cough, cough)  That is to say...  (deep breath)  Nice cover?<br /><br />No, wait.  Let me say a little more:<br /><br />This is not an historical novel.  Or if it is, it's not based on Egyptian history.  It's a colorful yarn, a violent, interesting, flashy bit of storytelling.  The author creates entertaining characters.  He conveys pathos, exultation, love, humor... You tend to forget that there isn't a lot of research involved in the tale.<br /><br />Don't get this book for someone you know who is a serious student of ancient Egypt: they'll die laughing.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|There are some really awesome songs on this album but then there are a couple I could live without. All in all, a decent purchase.
B000O14VAU|5.0|Great movies! Very exciting & action-packed!  I love them. Kate Beckinsale; (sp?), does a great job, as a kick-ass heroine!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I practically worship Hugh Laurie for all his talents. That being said, I didn't even know this album came out until I bought my calendar for this year. I wrote a review for that too. Yeah, a review for a calendar. I don't get why it's necessary either.<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't realize I liked New Orleans style blues until I got the album. Love it. Swanee River is one of my favorite songs now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ok so this book has been getting alot of hype because of the movie coming out. I am new to the series and figured why not take a look. I got the first on on my kindle and i read it in one day! I couldnt stop reading! I loved it! The action mixed with clues and trying to be one step ahead of the capital and Snow with Katniss is so amazing! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
B004H6P2N8|5.0|In terms of the music it includes, this set is a great bargain.  CD1 contains the Goldberg Variations, as on [[ASIN:B0000028NE Bach: Goldberg Variations, BWV 988 (The Historic 1955 Debut Recording)]]. This is Gould's original 1955 recording of the Goldberg Variations, not the second 1981 recording. CD2 contains the Two-Part Inventions and Three-Part Sinfonias, as on [[ASIN:B00006FI9S Bach: The Two and Three Part Inventions (Glen Gould Anniversary Edition)]].  CD3 contains the seven Toccatas BWV 910-916, as on [[ASIN:B0000028NM Bach: 7 Toccatas BWV 910-916]].  CD4 and CD5 contain the six Partitas plus a collection of Preludes, Fugues and Fughettas, identical to [[ASIN:B0000028NH Glenn Gould Edition - Bach: Partitas, Preludes & Fugues]].  CD6 is a duplicate of  [[ASIN:B00006FI8C Art of the Fugue - 70th Anniversary Edition]] with Glenn Gould playing part of the `Art of the Fugue' on organ, and part on piano, but without the very informative liner notes by Michael Stegemann which accompany the single-CD issue.<br /><br />Adding up what is included, this 6-CD collection is priced at about one-third of the cost of the smaller sets included.<br /><br />To read reviews of the music, the reader can refer to reviews of the sets listed above.<br /><br />But be warned:  this 6-CD set includes no liner notes whatsoever. The six CD's come in a cardboard box, with each CD in a plastic sleeve (no jewel boxes) - it's very portable. The only information about these recordings is on each of the plastic CD sleeves, listing the tracks and giving the date and location of each recording. There is no discussion of the music. Thus for example, CD1 contains 32 tracks of the Goldberg Variations, recorded June 10, 14-16, 1955 at Columbia 30th Street Studio in New York City, plus two more tracks with two Fugues recorded July 29-31, August 1, 1957.<br /><br />The absence of any liner notes for this collection is surely a cost-cutting move, to save printing costs. But especially given Glenn Gould's propensity to express himself in words (listen to the interview disc in [[ASIN:B0013DAC5Q Glenn Gould: A State of Wonder: The Complete Goldberg Variations (1955 & 1981) : A State Of Wonder]], or read the [[ASIN:0679731350 Glenn Gould Reader]]) including writing his own liner notes, this leaves a gap which is regrettable. Suggestion to Sony:  please provide DOWNLOADABLE liner notes (no printing cost!), to be downloaded via the Internet!<br /><br />(DGG has done this for the album [[ASIN:B003HJ7JFA Bach, J.S.: Cantatas & Sacred Masterpieces]], where the texts of the Cantatas can be downloaded on the Internet).'s propensity to express himself in words (listen to the interview disc in [[ASIN:B0013DAC5Q Glenn Gould: A State of Wonder: The Complete Goldberg Variations (1955 & 1981) : A State Of Wonder]], or read the [[ASIN:0679731350 Glenn Gould Reader]]) including writing his own liner notes, this leaves a gap which is regrettable.

B0059XTUEK|5.0|I read this book and was really excited to see the film finally. The movie moves pretty fast but I found michelle captivating. A lot of actresses have played marilyn over the years and none have done such an extraordinary job as michelle williams. She makes you feel marilyn throughout the film and gives you a sense of what marilyn may have been like. You may like this film you may love this film, I suggest you see this movie either way!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hard to write about just one book in the series after I have read them all. But it was action packed with a little romance. A different concept in battles. Could not wait to get the second and third book.

B000Z27HLS|5.0|A very nice rendition of Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey.  I liked it much better than the earler one done in 1987 by BBC. Never as good as the Novel, it does a nice job of hitting all the main aspects of the story and bringing it all together.  Definitly worth seeing if you like the book.
B007E73MSY|5.0|This is an outstanding album from start to finish. I have always been a fan of Max's music, from Sep thru NB and of course on into Soulfly. While there have been efforts at times that were perhaps weaker than others, Enslaved is very good throughout. Pick this up, you will not be disappointed. Well done Max.

Seriously a great investment.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very well written.  I had no idea Steve Jobs was so eccentric.  Also learning about the early years of Apple was very interesting.  In this day and age of smart mobile devices, I think this book is a fantastic read and I recommend it.

0609610570|5.0|This is a great book to have. This book shows you that the only difference between success and failure is execution. A person that experiences sucess is willing to put in the work they need to, a person who fails starts the work but isn't willing to take the proper measures to finish. In order to properly execute, you must start strong and finish strong.
0375842209|5.0|The human race has proven to be, all at once, terribly atrocious and profoundly lovely. Unfortunately for Death (the narrator of this story), as one of the major distresses of the job, he is inevitably present for all of the former and VERY little of the latter. Particularly, in Nazi Germany, Death is an extremely busy witness to fear, anger, despair, genocide and, as a result, is terrified of humans.<br /><br />However, in this setting of consternation and darkness, Mr. Zusak centers the story of The Book Thief around a tale of kindness, enduring love, personal and familial strength as well as a blinding glimpse of the unspeakable ability of the human spirit to persevere. As one reads this richly ambitious novel, there will be moments within the emotional experience of the reader destined to enlighten, sadden, encourage and devastate. Those who finish The Book Thief, will surely understand (and be thankful) why Death embraced Leisel Meminger's story as an act of hope and empathy to share with all of us; just as Leisel would do.
160094048X|5.0|Seriously amazing!  I have made so many of these recipes since i received the book.  I keep two types of cookies on hand for my husband and daughter.  These are seriously the most tasty, healthy cookies i've ever known.  They are easy to make, and sooooo tasty.  I think my fav so far are the Peanut Apple Pretzel Drops, but the Chocolate Bottom Macaroons are spectacular, and the Banana Everything Cookies and Whole Wheat Fig Bars and Peanut Butter Blondies and (i could go on forever :) are soooo great too.  If you don't have this book, GET IT!!!!

B00513F9Q6|3.0|This is the third book of Margaret Atwood's that I have read, and I must admit I do find her books pretty heavy going, although I enjoyed The Blind Assasin. There is a lesson here for all parents that children should have the company of other small children at an early age, play schools should be an integral part of a young childs upbringing. Bullying is taking it's toll both in the USA and the UK, and I do feel that children that have mixed with their peers at a young age, find their own circle of friends and and can mix far easier  Here is a child that has led a relatively sheltered life with her brother as her only companion and desperately needs friends. The problem is that she hasn't the life skills to deal with a bad situation. Sadly, after the initial sympathy I felt for her as a young child, I was left wondering over her actions and sentiments when she reached middle age.  I certainly didn't read strength in her character as she was unable to forget the past and forgive Cornelia, when she was needed.  At the same time, even at the end of the story, she missed her.  I also thought that she used her first Husband and felt no guilt or remorse over her actions, which seemed surprising. I found it difficult to relate to this character, as like others, I found that as an adult she was selfish, rude  and rather pathetic.  I couldn't see the strength in her character as an adult, as did other Readers.
0812550706|5.0|As avid and passionate readers, we each bear an ever-growing list of books that we know, within, we must read; A personal cannon that strengthens, enriches and validates us as the cultured and smartly cultivated readers we aspire to be. For me, Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game has resided on that list, in the invisible sci-fi section, for nearly twenty years. Because of its reputation as both a YA pathfinder and science fiction trendsetter, I feel like Ender's game has been visibly in my path for as long as I can remember, growing more and more intimidating the longer I staved it off. Well, as you would surmise by the existence of this review, I am proud to declare that Mr. Card's seminal novel no longer sits on that occult-like shelf of unread legends.<br /><br />Yep, I read it!<br /><br />Now, shifting into a more serious quality, while unsure whether or not Mr. Card had written Ender's Game with a young adult audience in mind or if it simply became designated as a book for teens because of the age of its protagonist, the novel certainly reads like YA. Its an energetic, breezy read told in a fairly straightforward manner.<br /><br />However, to be clear, in staying true to its science fiction heritage, Ender's Game offers plenty to be found slightly under the surface and beyond. Conventional themes of consumerism, over-population, environmental awareness and Marxist politics are all present in this story of Ender Wiggin and his group of battle school mates. Uniquely, though, Mr. Card presents these generic issues and more through the lens of a young, unseasoned genius whose rate of understanding and empathy grows analogous to that of the reader. So, in addition to interesting dilemmas concerning exploitation of children, Mr. Card's delivery of often familiar and ordinary themes and ideas now seem fresh and au courant through the eyes of young Ender.<br /><br />I feel pleased and contented to finally have read Ender's game and not just simply to remove it from my list. As one reads Ender's tale, its influence on countless science fiction, YA and bildungsroman stories is suddenly revealed. I have resolved, within my own literary experience, that Ender's Game is an important book and one that is sure to enrich, inform and entertain.st.

B000059590|1.0|The movie was in very good shape....except...you could only play it on a vcr in the United Kingdom! It was for my grandaughter and, as she lives a distance away, she did not return it to me. I am very disappointed! This grandaughter has been taking ballet lessons for 6 years and saw the play in New York. She had never seen this movie. I am very displeased and will not buy from this seller again.

B001OQCV6A|1.0|First of all, I'm a huge sherlock Holmes fan. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, followed by Jeremy Brett. And I've heard it all, that you have to reimagine characters every so often. But not at the sake of destroying the character all together, as one reviewer said, the only thing this movie and Sherlock Holmes had in common was the name, Holmes is not an action hero. In the books Watson is the one who carries a gun not Holmes, Holmes is a cerebal character. Being described in the books and the early movies, that he is so preoccupied with solving the case. That he forgets to bring along a weapon at the conclusion of the case, but appearently. Today's society can't have a movie without explosions, mindless chases. And no story, and yes. Holmes does know martial arts in the books, but he doesn't fight regularly. In fact, his background in fighting is only mentioned in one book. And please, Guy Ritchie isn't that great of a director, this was more of Robert Downey jr doing his toney stark impersination as holmes. This wasn't close to Sherlock Holmes.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I have tried several mics to try to find the best sound for my videos.  I'm using my Canon T2i DSLR camera on video mode.  Initially I used the on board mic.  Then I used the EzFoto Professional DV Stereo microphone I bought here on Amazon.  Finally I bought the Audio-Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone and it blew the others away!  For the money, it made my video's sound far more professional.<br /><br />I created a blog with the 2 videos embedded on youtube but can't put them on here.  You can google aaron stelle and I have a blog called, 'Creating Videos for Business - It's all About the Sound!'.  Listen to both videos and you'll hear the difference.<br /><br />These were taken with the same camera, as well as a similar environment and distance from the camera.  I think the results speak for themselves.
B006OFN0BQ|3.0|I wanted to buy this DVD.  I have lived long enough to have known about J. Edgar.  We who have invested in a large screen with HDMI  Hookups are denied CCs when viewing DVDs.  Only ENGLISH SUBTITLES work for us deaf oldsters.  One would think English subtitles would be a given on a BluRay.  However, I find myself a voice crying in the wilderness.  Thanks for listening!

B003DZX3SA|5.0|This is a classic movie that I have always loved! I could not wait to purchase it for my own child!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I don't know why a lot of people keep saying there is a noticeable audio gap...because there is not.  The sound quality is perfect with no gap at all. New sounds are constantly added for no additional charge. This is quite literally the best sound machine app out there today.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I love The Phantom of the Opera.  I've watched it live twice and hope to introduce it to my daughter when she's old enough.  This recording captures the intensity and emotion I remember when watching it live.  In comparison, the Hollywood version is stale and lacking.  If you are to buy a DVD of the Phantom Musical, this is the one to buy!  As a bonus, they gathered all the original cast Phantoms and Sarah Brightman for an encore performance, what more can you ask for?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is very easy to use. The sections are easy to find and bookmark. Great to have if you need a Bible handy at all times.
B00005R5G9|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot back in the 80's. I also recorded it on tape then when I saw it will be shown on tv so that I could watch it again and again but unfortunately lost it years ago because the tape got worn out after watching it too many times. Never saw it again since then. I was mad about the theme song \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\" since I first heard it playing at the end of the movie and I still am today each time I hear it. It's very funny how nobody can understand why this new young guy has those great successes of his window dressings. No one knows his secret and nobody can find out because each time someone other than him sees her she turn back into a dummy. It's a great laughing comedy for the whole family to enjoy for those who enjoyed the early 80's and others who haven't seen it yet. Even though the movie received very bad reviews, it still was a great hit at the Box Office. Personally I loved this movie. 2 Thumbs Up!

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This series is one of the best series that i could dream of. I am an avid HBO lover and own True Blood and Entourage and this first season of Game of Thrones destroys those series. If you love good T.V. you better buy this damn show! Also, buy true blood and mad men! both are awesome
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This is inspiring well played music. The kind that makes you think and Springsteen can still make the kind of music that makes you want to stand up and move. His music has never been just shallow romantic stuff. I think the over all sound quality of this album is very good. Everybody that is a fan of Springsteen has a favorite. Mine is \\"Devils and Dust\\", the album and the song. Wrecking Ball is not my favorite but it is a five star album, meaning it's better than 90% of what's out there.<br /><br />I remember reading an interview with Bruce back about the time of \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\". He said his \\"heroes\\" were people who got up each morning and went to work and tried to do the best for their families. How many Rock Stars or even famous people have said that? He still feels the same way and he's a hero to many all over the world.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|I purchased Season 1 and Season 2 from Amazon and it goes without saying I have been very impressed.  Placed order on one day and 2 days later had season 1 on my porch after work.  I spent a weekend watching the entire season and was tickled \\"purple\\" (my favorite color) by every episode.<br />I did not think I would like this quirky comedy but it has managed to do 2 very important things for me- touch my heart and make me laugh so hard that at times I cried!  Each character brings a special joy for the fans of this show.<br /><br />I highly recommend the show and Amazon as an ordering site.  You will get the exact same packaging and quality as you would in a retail store with a BETTER price!  I plan to continue using Amazon for all my DVD order needs.
B002BWP49C|5.0|If you are a TWILIGHT Fan this is a total must have.You will watch it over & over again. I love the Special Addition also because it shows you how the film was made.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have been using this set for over a year now.  I was happy with the surround sound and the wireless capability.  It is a bit pricey, but I like the comfort of the set.  I liked it so much I bought my son one.  I highly recommended it to some friends and now two of my friends have bought this set.  We all play BF3 and have had no issues with the support.  The most I enjoy is being able to chat with friends in between games and joking with them.  The set does get warm, I am assuming because of body heat, but I don't notice it until I take them off.  The fact that the mic mutes when you move the boom up is excellent.  Volume controll on the side of the ear is a plus.  The battery seems to last for about 3-4 hours of play with a warning when it gets low.  The chargin wire is long enough to use while I charge.  Also, our voices are clear and we seem never to cut each other off when talking.  Big thumbs up!
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I can't believe it took me this long to discover this cable adapter.  I have only been able to use my first generation Bose Sounddock with an old Firewire powered ipod (lost all the various ipod adapters long ago).

B006YTYIXG|5.0|Fronted as always by Max Cavelera, Soulfly have lived through enough line-up changes in the past to carry on strong no matter who joins or leaves their fold and deliver more of the same Thrash, Groove and World Music inspired Metal that the band have been creating since their inception a decade and a half ago.<br /><br />Enslaved is the band's eighth studio album. It was released in 2012 and finds the band recording with a new rhythm section as bassist Bobby Burns (who had been in the band since 2003) and drummer Joe Nunez (who was in the band since 2000, except for one album) get replaced by Tony Campos of Static-X and David Kinkade of Borknagar.<br /><br />Lead guitarist Marc Rizzo is now the band's second longest lasting member behind Max himself, and has become more and more integral to the band's sound and direction since joining in 2003 (in addition to appearing in alongside Max in his other band Cavelera Conspiracy.)<br /><br />Where Enslaved fits in with the rest of the band's catalogue is definitely closer in style to the sound found on the faster and darker albums like Dark Ages than the fun and bouncy tribal sing along albums like Primitive. It is probably the most straight forward, serious and un-experimental sounding album the band have ever done, which counter-intuitively lends the record a really interesting an vital sound.<br /><br />The style at this stage is completely absent of any Nu Metal influence, with the drumming and guitar generally a lot more clinical and thrash influenced than ever before, however the manage to do so in a manner that feels entirely modern and nothing like homage to the 1980s. The main riff of `Treachery' for example feels almost like it could have been written by Chimaira's Rob Arnold, and the huge string bends at the beginning of 'Chains' sound a little like recent Cannibal Corpse tracks in a subtle sort of a way.<br /><br />Enslaved also carves its own position in the Soulfly catalogue by having removed all traces of the World Music interludes, intros and outros that had peppered all of the band's previous work to at least some extent. Furthermore, the band even went as far as not including a Self-Titled instrumental track in the main album like they had always done on previous records (although one does crop up on the special edition. )<br /><br />One thing that Soulfly have never been able to stop themselves doing however is include guest appearances by other famous musicians, and on Enslaved this once again proves to be the case as Dez Fafara of Devildriver sings on the track \\"Redemption Of Man By God,\\" while Travis Ryan of Cattle Decapitation appears on the surprisingly Death Metal influenced lead single `World Scum.'<br /><br />Overall, Enslaved is a strong, well written and immaculately produced album by a confident and mature band. The direction is dark, precise and heavy modern metal music with a lot of shredding, a lot of speed and no messing around. If your favourite Soulfly albums were the first two and you don't usually enjoy any Thrash or Extreme Metal then it might not be what you wanted, but if you have enjoyed the direction that the band have been heading in for the last three or four albums then you will be happy to find them charging further down that path and sounding good doing it.<br />Commente World Music interludes, intros and outros that had peppered all of the band's previous work to at least some extent.

0385528752|4.0|I thought the Heaths' model of Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant, and Shape the Path was a bit awkward.  It seemed to me that they found a bunch of information on directing change and then stuffed it into a methodology that they could use to write a book.<br /><br />That being said, I thought the content of the book was fantastic.  I greatly appreciated that it was based on research rather than based on the author's opinions.  In sharp contrast to many business books I read and think \\"yeah, but what am I actually going to DO with this information?\\", this book provided me with a great deal of fascinating learning that I was able to quickly apply.
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun to play, lots of covers to choose from, lot of choices to play,  makes it easy at any age group
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is so much fun I love how u work for the points. its so much fun. Yay I wive it
0307712508|1.0|I own the unabridged audio CDs and I must say that I agree with the customers who thought that this book was TOO LONG and badly written! So many details about unnecessary things and simply not enough info about Henrietta Lacks herself! My main source of contention was that the actress reading the book tried to affect a \\" black,Southern accent! \\" The actress made EVERY black character in the book sound the same to the point of parody...it truly sounds ridiculous! There is so little first-hand knowledge about Henrietta Lacks,\\" the woman \\", that I wonder if ANYONE would be able to really write a proper book about her.
B002PEP4SC|1.0|If I wasn't already a fan of the TV series I wouldn't know anything about these characters even after reading part of this book.  I say part because I can't bring myself to finish it!  This reads like a play rather than a novel.  There's absolutely nothing here to inspire knowing these characters, their feelings etc.  No emotional anything and strictly two dimensional.  I was expecting great things but to state that I'm disappointed is a SEVERE understatement!!!!<br /><br />Clearly experienced novelists are not the ones writing this series!  This is borderline beginning novelists and mediocre at BEST!<br /><br />I wouldn't waste my time with this book or series! Stick to watching it on TV!  If you enjoy reading books with the same characters through a series there are TONS of great ones out there!  Don't settle for this!<br /><br />If I could rate it less than one star - I would!  Thank goodness this was free!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Fantastic Product!! The product was exactly as described in the description. Picture is perfect and is so compact so it can be used anywhere and everywhere. Would recommend to all hardcore gamers that cannot do without their XBOX and PS3.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I love this game! It's very easy in the beginning, but as you advance the levels become more challenging. I've only had this app for two days, and I've almost beat it completely! It may seem that some levels are impossible, but they all have solutions. It is just like 'Red Remover', a popular Internet game. Check it out on [...]! I'm currently on level 84, and it seems SO impossible! But, this game is definitely one that will have you thinking, and looking at things, differently. I absolutely love it, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys challenges, or puzzles. Hope everyone else enjoyed it too!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|When I was a kid I wished so often that the Lord of the Rings never ended. Now that Martin has basically done what I wanted Tolkien to do I am sooo glad that Tolkien was smart enough to conclude a perfect tale. What started out as true genius, as one of the greatest stories I have ever read has devolved into something quite boring. What a shame really. Someone please make him stop! Where the hell is his editor? How many meals can a writer describe in minute detail before an editor calls him up and just says \\"Seriously?\\"<br /><br />Sadly no one stopped him. Maybe someday George RR Martin will come to his senses and rewrite Books 4 and 5 in this series and do it right.<br /><br />I just don't know if I can wait another 11 years to find out.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Bought as a Xmas gift for my wife. She loves the movie and I go on trips to Africa so it's a great movie and especially on bluray it was a great deal on a Disney movie. Since Disney is expensive couldn't pass up on it. Came in new condition and worked great.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This app is really neat. I had to use the hint guide a couple of times, but it is very fun. I really like how the app is only $1.99. I reccomend this app.
0316066524|2.0|This was like driving across the US w/out cruise control, or better yet reading a long passage without a period in sight. Sure there were some neat things to see along the journey, with the whole time thoughts of finally getting to the coast and a big payoff. Dear DFW, you asked a lot of your readers and all we wanted was a worthwhile reading experience; we appreciate your literary prowess and excused your show-off nature, if only you thought about your reader.  I'm big fan of your essays; perhaps it's condensing your focus that's what I like and find very readable.  There's a lot of glowing reviews, sorry I just don't get it...reader be aware.
B000WJSCZE|5.0|We all attend presentations nowadays and we attracted by those who are simple, catchy, attractive and visual. \\"Less is more\\" is very applicable in presentations; once you read this book, you certainly change the presentation layouts.<br />For a person involved in business and public speaking, this book is useful, aesthetic, pragmatic and creative. Excellent content, both the words and the visuals.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was amazing. I read through it in a day because I could not put it down. I immediately bought the second and third books because I became obsessed with Katniss and had to find out what happened.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Great writing, addiciting. You don't want to put it down. I would highly recommend this series if you have an open mind. It is a bit of a dirty read.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this was sn app for ipod and I also got it for kindle good good. j am writing a review to get 25000 credits tor this amazing app
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Hey PopCap, how about an update that fixes this so I can at least *play* the game I bought? I'm running Ice Cream Sandwich and have plenty of memory. There shouldn't be a problem.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|First and foremost, if you are rough on phones or are just paranoid about tossing around your iPhone, don't get this cover. Not because it isn't awesome but because it isn't meant for superior protection. If you want something like that, Otterbox is one of many brands that offer cases for serious protection.<br />I have to admit - I wasn't looking for anything fantastic when I ordered this. I actually even ordered a different screen protector because I imagined with the price, it wouldn't be that great. I got my case and screen protector within 2 days with Amazon Prime 2 day shipping. My other screen protector is still working its way here. But I didn't want my screen to go without protection so I put it on temporarily. Not going to lie, I will keep this thing on until it doesn't do the job anymore. You can't even tell that it's on. I put it on without any bubbles and honestly, it is a great screen protector. The case clicks on with little effort and you know that it is on well. There is a lip on the front to raise the screen off surfaces and on the back where the camera is. I can tell do difference between my pictures with the case on vs off. I also do not have a doc station so for me, this is not a problem as of yet. I've heard that you aren't able to doc this to an iHome without taking the cover off. The cover also shows off the phone (because of course, they are very nice looking). Overall, I LOVE this cover and screen protector. I am easy on phones except for the occasional drop and it seems like with the silicon/hard cover it will be protected in such an event. This case also slides in and out of pockets easy and doesn't collect lint. Great product at a great price that has excellent overall design, protection and looks.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is so freaking cute!!!! I love it!!! Great game for only 50 cents, I highly recommend it to anybody :)
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|Cast Away is one of Tom Hanks' best films, on DVD the scenery was great, but in BluRay it's almost like your there seeing the pristine oceans and crystal clear starlit nights. A must buy for all BluRay enthusiasts!
0307956350|5.0|Such a good book! One of those you can't wait for the end, but don't want it to end.It's a good thing they used 2 different fonts for the 2 different time lines otherwise it'd be very confusing to follow. I won't summerize this book, but I hope the author,Chris Pavone,uses his main character,Kate,in a follow-up novel.Bravo,job well done!!
B006O5XYWG|4.0|No film is perfect (except maybe Citizen Kane) and neither is this one but it is exceptionally entertaining and a thought-provoking sci-fi flick. It seems though it suffers from cut scenes near the end and thus making the plot somewhat rushed but I can see why those types of scenes might be omitted while a climactic battle is erupting so bravo to Rise!<br /><br />SPOILER BELOW<br /><br />When Caesar first spoke I felt a chill in my spine I haven't felt in a long time and remembered cinema magic, thanks.
B005FUTBV4|5.0|Every time I thought I knew where it was going it took a turn. I really enjoyed watching a movie that I could not predict the ending of. It is classic Kevin Smith writing, but in a different setting than we are used to, which was fun, and definitely has a Tarantino flavor to it. I was worried it would be too violent for me (I can be a bit of a wuss) but it was pretty perfect.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|bag it is the best game I have ever got. it is 96 levels of fun. I play it every day and it is no different to play the same levels over again. there are 16 levels in each world and 6 worlds. try to collect 2 ribbons and 3 stars in each level. :)
B005CKPQNE|5.0|For pure adrenaline fun, excellent acting and writing, interesting and thoughtful story lines and just quirky as hell, I love it. Maybe Carl Jung was right. We all have a dark side. Damn, Walt REALLY has a dark side. I can't wait for the final season. It looks like this will be a show that goes out on top.
B00170F0WU|4.0|This movie is action. The odd relationship between a professional hit man and a young girl who has become street wise and hardened by her all to short childhood,<br />the girl becomes all most a Lolita to the hitman, she wants to become a hitman, she admires/falls in love with him, his hardened heart is touched by the girls toughness which is only an exterior defense.<br /><br />The action becomes fast and furious almost from the beginning, Leon is invincible it seems, taking on all the \\"bad\\" good guys. He wins in the finale by losing.<br /><br />Leon is a simple and uneducated man.....\\"Lolita\\" teaches him to read.  His entrusted friend.... his banker robs him.  Leon is a loser in all senses of the word, but in his losing he overcomes.<br /><br />I have watched this movie several times...I love it, enjoyed it every time, the relationship between Leon and the girl intrigues me.....innocence and....well sort of beauty and the beast kind of story.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I waited several years to watch this movie and was very disappointed, it was not the movie I thought it would be. What the hell, a couple goes to Morocco to get over the death of their sun and leaves their kids with an illegal alien that takes them over the Mexican border to the middle of nowhere, then leaves them in the dessert to die. And what the hell was the deal with the mute/horney Japanese girl.  Just seemed like a movie about people making dumb choices.  I've read other reviews about how some people say it's about \\"human psychology and behavior\\", and we all can relate to this movie....? I know when I was a teenage girl I did strange drugs and ran around wearing no panties and flashed people in public places.  In real life most normal people do not deal with tragedies or to everyday life in general the way his movie portrays. I can't believe it made that much money at the box office....I don't get the appeal of this movie.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A well written book, I liked the way the author brought in data into a story type scenario. I enjoyed it very much.
B003UESJHE|4.0|Love this movie.  reminds us we really can do what we have to with the help of people who love us.
B005UG542S|4.0|Enjoyed this movie.  Good quality on download.  Was a trial for me to see what movie was like on Kindle Fire - good experience and I will do it again.
B001OSIV62|5.0|Sheer joy. The subject of the film had an intuition (as a male teenager, no less) he thankfully followed and which would become the course of his life.  A breathtaking, magical and divine event was to be the climax of that intuition. Just viewing this supremely crafted doc shifted my life.  I wish everyone would watch - it would probably change the world just how it needs to be changed.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Very addictive game. I cannot stop playing with this game. Every level provides a new challenge. Highly recommend it. Looking forward to seeing new levels.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Easy to use; very similar to the familiar PC version, and it's also free of annoying glitches. For a free game, it's totally worth downloading and at least keeping in your Cloud.
B00139XTG4|5.0|Taleb has an interesting and deviating view on the concept of uncertainty and predictions which view he exhibits and defends in this book. Without any statistical and economical background it may be a little difficult to read, but it would still be worthwhile. He gets a little too personal in my opinion from time to time, but this could also be perceived as 'convinced' of his views & 'enthusiastiam'. Definitely a 'must' for MBA students.
B005K2XUPK|5.0|The case has really solid construction, I take it everywhere and have yet to notice any frayed stitching. The outside is sturdy,and the sewn border helps protect the edges of my Kindle Fire. The felt interior helps to clean my Kindle Fire's screen, but the snug fit makes me worry about any larger particles on the screen-a puff of air so far has been sufficient to keep them off. I like the styling, and I feel anything short of a hard case is not going to be better.
B0000AC8LR|1.0|I just finished watching this movie and cannot believe that I wasted my time on it.  The writers tried to make a story that was believable and it just wasn't - there were so many facets to this dimly lit diamond of a movie that it ended being so vague with so many questions unanswered.  Even the ending was \\"out of this world\\" with regard to logic and good movie theme.  I bought this movie based upon the rave reviews.  But this movie completely failed in every category.  Don't waste your money on it.  I don't care what the other 800+ viewers wrote praising this movie.  It is a \\"crash and burn\\", DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, movie.
B006B31B80|5.0|I like the occassional zombie movie, but wouldn't call mysself a die hard.  This show, however,  is very addictive.  Start watching from season one.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|Fantastic film, that really opens your eyes and encourages you to change your ways and research more on the matter.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series and couldn't stop reading until the end of the third book.  I don't usually like or enjoy science fiction, nor do I have a stomach for violence, but this book was exceptional.  I would recommend it to anyone-young or older who likes action, characters that are interesting and courageous, and edge of your seat suspense.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Surprised by some of the less than favorable reviews. I thought this book was fantastic. While yes, there were some parts that made me think Twilight, I thought this story was an interesting new take on witches and vampires. I was fascinated by all the historical figures and writings that were woven in. Unlike other readers, I found all the details regarding wine and architecture to be fascinating. The amount of research that must have gone into the written is phenomenal. These historical undertones should entertain the reader that isn't entirely on the supernatural bandwagon either. Definitely has a way more adult feel than Harry Potter and The Hunger Games and more serious and thought provoking than True Blood. I can't wait for the next book in the series comes out and hope more people give this book a chance!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I  installed this application when I needed a note app for my class. After seeing these apps how they work :<br />Colornote<br />Spring pad<br />I found myself enjoying this app more. If my kindle ever breaks down, I never have to worry about my notes because Evernote always syncs up my notes on the computer. I love this app!!!!
B0067QPVD2|3.0|Based on a story \\"Who Goes There\\" by John W. Campbell Jr., this is the third effort to convert an excellent Sci-fi story into movie form.<br /><br />Original story: We find that thousands of years ago a rocket crashed and was buried in the Polar Regions.  It was found due to a magnetic disturbance. On extraction there is an accident.  We find a being from another world and another time.  The being has powers of deception and shape shifting.  Yet the story is not really of supernatural beings as it is of the people and their relationship to each other. As with many great mysteries it is always the last person you suspect. That is one of the strong points of Sci-Fi, not the technology as it will come about soon enough; what it is really about is how we deal with our fellow humans under duress.<br /><br />The first film effort was in the fifties with the movie \\"The Thing from another World.\\" Naturally it complied with the monster movies of the time and starred James Arness in a veggie suit. It was lots of fun, spooky and had some of the original electrical devices from the book. If you like fifties sci-fi, do not miss this one.<br /><br />This effort was made as a prequel to the1982 Carpenter version when the monster moved from veggie suits to cheap graphics. The graphic tradition is kept on this presentation. There was a need for the story to be fleshed out and Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. did better at portraying people as people than Carpenter did.<br /><br />Still the story was fluffed out with Carpenter esque story telling and misses the point of the book and the film spends too much time with blood and guts to focus on the people interaction. Sure there is some interaction or we would not have a movie at all.<br /><br />The thing in the book was psychic and could read and manipulate minds which the film overlooks.<br /><br /> In this movie e have an organic way to determine who intruder is that is different from the Carpenter movie's detection methods.  We end with the beginning of the 1982 version.<br /><br />Just a note: they supply subtitles for the parts that are not in English.e end with the beginning of the 1982 version.<br /><br />Just a note: they supply subtitles for the parts that are not in English.
0385528752|4.0|This book our team read together and it was fundamental in helping us understand change and get us on the same page. We began using the terminology from the book like the elephant and rider. It helped us gel as a new team and also focus on the right things as we began making changes to our organization.
B004JRVQX0|5.0|I bought this Ilok 2 with better price then everywhere. Works good. Everything is OK. If you have to buy it this is the best source.
B004LROUW2|2.0|Murakami's lengthy tome begins with a strong, clear voice imagining an intriguing parallel world with two moons and magical Little People who fight with otherworldly forces for control of the planet and perhaps nature itself.  At the center of this struggle are two protagonists, a girl, Aomame (an assassin with an agenda) and Tengo (a gifted mathematician and want-to-be novelist).<br /><br />It's a good start and an interesting set-up; however, over nearly 1,000 pages Murakami's prose slackens while the plot thickens almost into a muddy slog--at which point it takes a step or two off course into misogynistic territory that might be a bit too much for western tastes.  I, like Murakami himself it seems, began to lose interest about half way in, but being the good reader I soldiered on to the end, where he sets things up for a possible sequel.  All I can say to that is, \\"Please, no! Don't do it.\\"<br /><br />In this case the marketing hype surrounding the launch of this book far outweighed the actual value of this thick read.<br /><br />I am a big fan of speculative long-form fiction--the mighty, and mighty long, Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson, is a good, recent example.  Where Stephenson continues to dazzle and engage after 3,000 plus pages, Murakami seems to run out of steam after 250.<br /><br />An earlier review of this book warned off readers new to Murakami.  In retrospect I should have taken the advice.  At this point I'm simply too fatigued to consider buying another of his novels, and it seems that that's too bad.  It will have to be a while before I can consider picking up another Murakami novel, thick or thin.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having so many versions of God's word with me at all times! Very easy to use on the Kindle Fire!
0321344758|3.0|This book is awesome. Why? It's short, to the point, and avoids needless words. For the beginner in Web usability or a pro, the principles are solid and transcend outside building Web sites. They could be used in multiple areas of life. I'd highly recommend and have given this book as a gift.
B005ZC0SYQ|4.0|Can't help but watch this with sadness at what-might-have-been: with \\"RapidFire\\", Brandon showed that his martial arts chops could rival his father's; with \\"The Crow\\", he clearly demonstrates that his acting chops would have far exceeded Bruce Lee's. He had all of that physical quality of acting that, since Bruce's passing, has only been occasionally shown by Jet Li and Donnie Yen, but neither of them has really measured up to the potenial that Brandon demonstrates in \\"The Crow\\". This film isn't quite enough of an epitaph, but it's all we've got.

B00004XMTJ|1.0|I bought this disc for my kids who got into T.S. Eliot lately. I was glad to see Elaine Paige's name in it too.<br />DVD just arrived...  the package of this disc is very poor, worse than any street vendor's pirate copy quality disc. There is nothing other than a disc in the plastic case. Disc top is printed so badly to make it look scratched.<br />I rarely write review on products I buy online but this product made me to do that and check amazon.com to see if this was illegal copy or something.<br />Very disappointed.
0307463745|4.0|Rework is a dream to read. It's written for people like me. 1-2 page chapters. With pictures. Practical knowledge for innovation. Fried breaks things down simply on how we can be more efficient, effective, and innovative for team. A few key ideas our team are looking at are meetings being toxic, virtual quiet hours, and urgency kills. I'd recommend anyone in leadership to grab this book, read it, and work through it with your team.  After I led my team through this, we implemented several suggestions that are now part of our culture.
B004SYP5WC|2.0|I decided to try it since it was being offered for free.  Glad I didn't pay for it. There is nothing this app can do that the Google Calendar can't.  there are issue too.  If I set up a repeating event, then update the initial event, subsequent events do not update. You need to delete the entire series and start over. The interface is clean and easy to use though which is why I didn't give it only one star. I will be sticking with my Google Calendar setup.
B006OKOZGU|5.0|If you love the film as I have for nearly sixty years .....and I saw it for the first time as a sixteen year old<br />back in 1955...the arrival in blu ray is some happy event.<br />Yes it was good in the previous release but the new blu ray quality of image is superb.<br />Was it this good in 1955 in a cinema? I wonder!<br />For me the enjoyment of the stars and the Hitchcock direction and the John Michael Hayes script is enhanced once more.<br />I look forward with pleasurable anticipation to more Hitchcock blu ray treats.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|for free I didn't expect much...I was wrong...its a great way to help you read the Bible. it gives you plan options which is great...or just pick your own readings.  great for Easter...i set a plan for 40 days of lent and I cant wait for each day to read what's new. I love the audible.  helps me stay focused. I put my earbuds in to block out all noises which is great to take it all in....I would highly recomend this app..amazing that its free!
0007455992|3.0|I've been waiting forever for the 5th book to be available in paperback. Now it's barely available and costs over $20? It might be worth paying if I wasn't seeing so many negative reviews. As much as I love the HBO series, \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" I hope Mr. Martin gets back to writing excellent and exciting books soon.
B005M48WNQ|4.0|I am currently giving up meat completely for lent and have been slowly phasing it out of my diet for awhile. I've always been scared to read this text, fearful that it would guilt me into something I may not be ready for.<br /><br />Informed<br />- First of all, I appreciated that Foer kept his literary voice. The writing is solid.<br />- His powers of persuasion are effective and impressive. The way he begins his drive with his pet dog was extremely effective.<br />- He seems honest... (see below, though)<br />- He didn't hold back- it gets gruesome, but sugar-coating brutality wasn't what he was going for.<br />- I felt empowered and informed when I finished<br /><br />But...<br />- He does have a motive and an agenda. It is definitely one-sided.<br />- I don't necessarily love how the book was organized; sometimes I felt that it lacked structure.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun for the adults and kids to play! enjoy unlocking the new games to see what is next! some games are hard and have had difficulty with.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|When I started this book, I was not sure I would like the story. After getting into it, I realized this story was going to keep me going until the end. A few times, I thought it was about to end only to find out that there were other twists and turns down the road. Can't think of a better way to spend a few days than reading this interesting book. It will leave you with questions and deep thoughts. Highly recommend.

B0072X2O66|4.0|For me I was more looking forward to Russell than Portnoy with this release. For Portnoy it's pretty average drumming, nothing like DT but that's what I think he wanted to do. Russell does great on the album. Definitely not a masterpiece but decent enough with some catchy songs. Not many prog fans would be into this but it's more accessible than Symphony X and DT but just average.
B0041KKYEW|4.0|This movie is very dark, but it also is good, I wish the movie was a little more clear on everything so I don't get lost so easily, as a wife and soon to be mother I need movies that I can come in and out of the room without worrying about what did I miss and what is going on
B004VMUS9G|4.0|well it was a good app at first but then i had set an alarm.with the place car in dock setting and i didn't know how to disable the alarm so the alarm kept going for 2 days and the i had to delete the app and start over

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This typically is not my kind of book,however I couldn't put the Hunger Games down and didn't realize it was a trilogy until the end of the 1st book. Needless to say I downloaded and read the rest of the series within days! It's been a long time since a book gave me that kind of anticipation to get to the end to see how it ends!
B005RUS7LC|5.0|This is such a great show that I've watched episodes multiple times and replayed scenes over and over to enjoy.  The show is well written with rich characters with performances that are magnetic.  There are many powerful scenes that satisfy, unlike that show with the non ending that is one I will not even mention its title.  This show is amazing.
1612130283|5.0|I had not heard of this author or book.  I saw an installment on the rise of this novel via the Today show on NBC, which prompted me to purchase all 3 books.  I am normally a reader of Nicholas Sparks, James Patterson, Nora Roberts and Jodi Piccoult.  I was heading out on an 8 day cruise and thought I would try something new.<br /><br />I will say I was hooked from the beginning.  I thoroughly enjoyed the characters of Anastasia and Christian.  They had depth, humor, deep rooted issues and the ability to love unconditionally, while holding on to their individual beliefs.  It is steamy for sure and I learned an awful lot about the sub/dom world that I was never aware of.  That said, it is a wonderful love story, full of ups and downs, twists and turns, family and past relationships and how all impacts Ana and Christians' relationship.  He is so many shades of f'ed up its wild to watch his mood swings.  But its also wild to watch how Ana deals with them and the input of her subconscious and alter inner goddess continual chiming in is both humorous and insightful at the same time.<br /><br />I found myself glued to each book, whether sunning on deck or holed up in my cabin after dinner.  I came to enjoy the characters, rooting for them to discover and admit their love for one another, actually missing them when I was torn away.  I will miss these characters and would love to read more by EL James.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who isn't afraid of a highly erotic adult novel, with a lovely, yet fought for, love story.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|If you enjoy a good historical and/or love story with well-developed and lovable characters written in an enchantingly quaint voice, you will LOVE The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.

B002IFT1ZA|1.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />This is the first time I have ever encountered an entertainment product--movie, book, game or TV series--that I felt the need to warn other users away from via an online review. But Season 1 of Game of Thrones deserves such a review. Fans of the book need to know that while about 75% of the series thus far is a faithful adaptation of the first book of A Song of Ice and Fire, the other 25% not only dishonors the source material but dishonors everything from artistic license to common decency.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I am no prude. I have read A Game of Thrones, highly descriptive sex scenes and all. I have watched HBO shows before and know their modus operandi involves nudity and graphic sexuality. I thought I knew what I was getting into when I bought this box set.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Where the sexuality is Martin's book is sensual, well-written, and important to the narrative, HBO's is just...badly-done porn. Not content with the sex Martin had already written, HBO decided to add in a slew of poorly-done and completely unnecessary scenes that detract from the show's artistic value and distract from the actual story. Apparently HBO thought that in order to sell a series based on a wildly popular book, they would have to add a teenage boy shaving a man's chest and giving him oral sex, two women being ordered into humiliating faux-sex by an angry, repressed pervert (who is neither in the book), and plenty of other random bits and body parts.<br /><br />And for no particular reason, we get a random scene in which Littlefinger and Varys run down all the sexual deviancies of various lords--none of which are anywhere to be found in the book. Mercifully we are spared from actually seeing Lord Martell's supposed fondness for young boys or an unnamed lord's necrophilia . . . but I wouldn't rule it out in later seasons.<br /><br />And to make matters worse, I was just as surprised at the sensual scenes HBO left out of the series inexplicably. Instead of the vital, tender, emotional scene between Lord and Lady Stark near the book's beginning, we get two fully-clothed people telling jokes to each other. Dany and Drogo's encounter beneath the stars is nowhere to be scene; we get more romanticism between Dany and her (female) slave than Dany and her husband. With all the time they spend adding pointless sex to the show, it's simply stupid that HBO left out the tasteful sex scenes that actually matter to the plot and the characters.<br /><br />In short, HBO cut the majority of the sensuality and genuine character development in Martin's book and focused on stuffing as many sexual acts as they could into the script. The result is that instead of deepening our connections to the characters as human beings, we end up asking more often than not what the HECK is wrong with them.<br /><br />Another warning I have to give out is the special effects. Namely, there aren't any to speak of, awfully surprising for a fantasy series. The direwolves are just normal dogs. The dragons are unimpressive. Bran's dream sequences are . . . actually there's just one they keep using over and over again, and it's nowhere near as well-thought out as Martin's.<br /><br />And if you were looking forward to seeing what HBO would do with the terrifying Others or Muzzi Maz Dur's magic, prepare to settle for some extras in white facepaint and a tent you don't even see inside.<br /><br />My best guess is that special effects men demand more money for their work than actors do for nude scenes.<br /><br />Now to be fair, let me emphasize some of the real strengths of the series. First of all, the casting is inspired for the most part and positively immaculate in others. Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister) is an absolute revelation in possibly the most difficult role in the series. He will be racking up awards the rest of his career. Many of the minor characters are just as letter-perfect: David \\"Filch\\" Bradley (Lord Walder Frey) and Miltos Yerolemou (Syrio Forel) were among my personal favorites. And the child actors do a fantastic job with Martin's well-written characters. And as with most HBO shows, the scenery and costuming is fantastic and really sucks you into the world of Westeros.<br /><br />But for all the good work they did, HBO's insistence on marketing to the \\"curious 13-year-old boy\\" demographic comes within a hair's breadth of ruining the show altogether.<br /><br />I was fortunate to get the box set for very little cash thanks to gift certificates I had saved up. I would advise all true fans of the book to wait until it goes significantly on sale before giving HBO your money, to make up for all the scenes you'll be skipping.
B000FP2OPY|1.0|Well, I got this as a gift (along with season 2), so I can't say how shipping was.<br /><br />My mother got this for me as I adore The X-Files, The Twilight Zone, and The Outer Limits. She had caught a few episodes and compared it to a \\"grown up version of 'Are you Afraid of The Dark'.\\" If only. Nick's kid show from the 90's had better effects and plot lines, as well as more believable actors.<br /><br />I sat through 20 some episodes of this crap waiting for what my girlfriends promised me \\"was the good part\\".<br /><br />Too bad the good part doesn't come until the very end of season 2.<br /><br />Save your money and skip ahead to Season 3.<br />They explain everything every episode and make sure you are \\"Up to speed\\" by a flashy music montage, so you don't need to waste your time on these first 2 poorly written monstrosities.<br /><br />I wish I could load up a sawed-off with rock salt and shoot the first two seasons to send them back to hell where they belong.<br /><br />Also, disk quality is poor. Maybe an angel spared me but the first 2 disks are pretty much scratched up beyond belief just by playing them once or twice.<br /><br />Tl;dr?<br />Skip to season 3.
0439023483|4.0|It was definitely entertaining.  It is a very quick read, I'm not an especially quick reader and it only took a few hours to read.  I liked that the main character was very ageless, making her identifiable to numerous people.  The first 3/4ths of the book was nearly perfect plot wise, and then it got strange.  It was almost as if the author didn't know how to get where she wanted to go, so decided to change up some rules and throw in some new and strange things for the heck of it.  There were some inconsistencies- they can bioengineer whole species in a short period of time but haven't mastered creating new limbs?  Really???  Also, it felt like she was trying to avoid some of the tougher moral questions, never quite putting the main characters in circumstances where they had to make them.<br /><br />I really have no desire, at this point, to read the sequels due to the ending.  Having said that it is very refreshing to read a book with such a strong teenage female protagonist.  Especially after Twilight.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|I read all the reviews and they said this game was great but it STINKS! the first dish that you serve only takes 5 minutes but then every other dish takes 5-24 hours to cook!

On Tuesday's and Thursdays we shared a bottle of wine and a meal, and then my SO and I gritted our teeth as we watched this abomination pretentiously lurch around to the tune of a \\"5 star rated TV show, it's even better then the X-Files!\\". My SO could not contain his glee, but I knew slightly better what was coming.<br /><br />Oooooh, other couple. How thoust betrayed us!<br />My SO and I sat up talking about how awful it was for week upon week.<br />If I hadn't gone to college with you other couple, I would break the bottle of wine over your head and be done with you for twisting the truth so!<br /><br />So we sat, and we sat, and we watched 48 episodes of drudgery and chauvinistic male bonding. I know these guys are supposed to be handsome and all, but they really needed a little more time acting, the lines up until when someone important goes to a crossroad are AWFUL.<br /><br />Regardless, The last couple of episodes to my surprise were good. It may have been the wine, but I'll let the show take what little credit I can give it.<br /><br />My SO and I began season 3, which we actually bought, and are now semi enjoying it. Some parts are still awful, and seem to be written on a low functioning acid addict who watches too much SHADOWS, but, I digress.<br />So save yourself a trip to hell and skip to the last disk, then sell it.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, the show could start out on Episode 26 (maybe 28?) of Season 2, and nothing would be missed.<br /><br />Also, disk quality is slightly better but not by much.<br />***Note, for you younguns: SO is Significant Other.

B005XRU62C|5.0|In her second project, Ms. Welch wows the listener with a selection of songs, each of which showcases her amazing vocal abilities in a different way. From the very beginning until the last song Ms. Welch displays her essentially human sound that draws one in. I got this CD the day it came out, and I have not grown tired of it yet. With each new listen, a new aspect of the music comes out.

Still, for the intended audience<br />[mostly, boys], the books are excellent.

B0072X2O66|5.0|For those who are looking for a progressive metal band, this is not it. Mike Portnoy(drummer) said this album is fun, its not about counting odd time signatures and having different movement. This album is full of great 3-5 minute songs. The two ballads 'All on the Line' and 'Angel Sky' are beyond amazing. The cover of 'Come Undone' originally by Duran Duran which features Lzzy Hale of Halestorm raises the hair on my neck and gives me chills. Lzzy Hale and Russell Allen mix perfectly together on that song, and I hope they preform it live someday. All of their other songs are great. The songs that were on the EP have some minor changes which makes them better. My least favorite song on this album is 'Freight Train' but it is still great.<br /><br />And again, if you are looking for Prog, this isn't it.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Exactly what i needed.  Ive kept a notebook listing in and outs paids and to be paids and then i found this app. It took me about 30 mins to add everything exactly how i wanted it and now i can relax and have it keep track of monthly bills for me. Tjank you thank you thank you.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Tried a neoprene sleeve and was mightily unimpressed with its flimsiness. Got this instead for my beBook and it's a dream. Very sturdy and looks fantastic on the table. Only thing I would change is to have something hold it closed- after folding the front around so I could hold it in one hand, it doesn't want to stay closed. Add an electronics-safe magnet and it would be absolutely perfect.
0307165485|4.0|Such a treasure to read with our kids. I had this book as a child. Now our children are enjoying hours of reading and studying the fabulous pictures. I do wish they were in original form and had not been made \\"politically correct\\". That's the only reason I left one star off.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Preordered this before it came out on DVD. I received it quickly and it was for a good price as well. Love this movie and would recommend buying it from here to anyone.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I've watched many period dramas, and this one stands out in its appeal for people whether romantics or not.  This one is based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel _North and South_.  It has romantic elements without having romance as the singular basis for its appeal.<br /><br />For viewers not so sold on romance, there is drama involving life's stages; social complexity of rich magnates vs. poor working class; questions of justice and fairness in legal situations (i.e. Fred's situation of having to live in Spain for fear of being hanged).  There is humor with the characters of Dixon and Fanny.  There are true to life transitions of two people overcoming their differences for the reward that is in their sameness.  All of these and more contribute to the opportunities for relatedness in this story.<br /><br />Other favorite aspects of this movie are the screenplay and the casting.  If I look too closely at the direction of some scenes, I notice that there is usually filming either very close to the subject or very far away, not as much in between.  My personal opinion is that more \\"in between\\" would've made the movie even better, but I do make it a point not to be distracted by something like that.  The story is easy to get lost in, and I always do.<br /><br />Special features include deleted scenes, an interview with Richard Armitage who plays Mr. Thornton, commentary etc.<br />Clearly this already has a lot of recommendation.  I will add my comment to agree with all the others, and to record the approval of movies well made.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is the best app I ever downloaded for most of you people who say 1 2 3 or 4 stars you don't know much about what your supposed to do I purfor 5 stars for this app
B005D63ICI|5.0|Season 5 is every bit as good as 123&4..What a story !  Sometimes predictable and sometimes not but it will grab you from the opening of Season 1 and leave you wanting more at the end of Season 5. The premise is disturbing but as you submerge in the tale of Dexter it seems to make sense. All the characters are \\"big\\" and in stark contrast with each other. My favorite is the Asian Forensics guy.  As a bonus, everything is shot in and around Miami and the scenery is great.  I can't wait for Season 6.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|This show is great if you like Sci-Fi? It is hillarious from start to finish. Paul is a true down to earth Alein with a foul mouth, so it's not a kids show.<br />Have fun with him and prepare to laugh!!!!!!

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|This is a remarkable piece of work in the world of pay for view television.  The writing and the actors are excellent.  The story is set in the 1920's and is historically accurate.  It's always fascinating to see how producers incorporate a fictional story into a historical background, and this is done beautifully.  Ultimately, the most impressive and intriguing aspect is the character development and interaction of those characters.  You find yourself studying them, analyzing why they are who they are as you learn the history of each.  This is an intellectual production with a fascinating storyline.  If you want action, this is probably not what you're looking for.  If you value cinematic discourse, have an interest in US history (particularly around 1920), and are curious about the origin of organized crime in America, you'll like this.
B0018OAPAW|1.0|I really like the Offspring past...I grow up listening to IGNITION, SMASH and IXNAY ON THE HOMBRE, the 3 really great OFFSPRING albuns...Maybe hardcore masterpieces...I like Americana, which got good songs...Conspiracy of 1 and Splinter got some decent tracks...This one got 2 or 3 decent songs like HAMMERHEAD and YOU GONNA GO FAR, but also got some totally EMO songs!!!!When i hear Kristy are you doing ok and fix you, reminds me kind like good charlotte...BLERGH! Why, Offspring? Why? I can argue with Original prankster and HIT THAT, but what you done here makes me cry......But the truth is, Offspring starts to lose their way on americana....

1612130607|5.0|The only bad thing I can say about this book is that the story came to an end. I am so happy Fifty got his HEA but I wanted \\"more\\" when I finished it months ago and I still want \\"more\\".  I can't seem to let go of Christian and Ana's world and I take comfort in knowing that I am not alone. I am a part of a large group that feels the same way and everyone I pass this series onto let me know that they didn't eat, sleep, clean or run errands once they started reading it.  I loved the bonuses and hope that with the way she ended it we will be getting \\"more\\" in the very near future.  I have read the whole series 4 times now and have no plans of stopping at 4.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I have not seen the movie yet, but the book was awesome! Children and adults alike will be captivated by Joey's narration of his journy as a war horse during WWI.  History buffs and animal lovers will especially be drawn into Joey's world.

B000SEGUDE|4.0|First I must admit: this isn't a book I would normally choose to read but my book club picked it so I read it. Generally I don't like short stories because it doesn't give the reader enough time to get involved with, learn, appreciate, like/dislike the characters and that is partially true with Cloud Atlas. The difference is 1) each short story is linked to the one(s) prior, and 2) halfway through the book we revisit the stories in reverse order, finding out the ending to each.<br /><br />The first story/chapter was the hardest for me and at that point I didn't like the book at all but I'm glad I kept reading because the book grew on me. It was incredibly frustrating to finally begin to understand the main character a bit (of that particular story) and then have the story sudden end and BOOM! onto something completely different. I think the book's saving grace is the fact that it loops back around and you find out more of the stories. If that weren't the case the book would have only gotten 2 stars from me.<br /><br />Overall the stories are interesting though the abrupt change in language, style, and storyline is very jarring and you have to restart the process multiple times in the book. Some of the connections between the stories are a bit implausible but let your imagination run a little bit and just enjoy it.<br /><br />Of note, this book would probably be easier to read in paper form vice on a kindle. I wanted to flip back to the previous stories to get a refresher on precisely where they'd left off but with the kindle it's hard to do that.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a truly fascinating look at the life and work of Steve Jobs. It is well written, exhaustively researched, and particularly interesting for those of us who were growing up at that time. He was clearly a genius if that means being a visionary. He could see the future for computers even if he was no Wozniak in writing code. But what a schmuck! You would not have picked him for a son, a father, a husband, a friend and, most definitely, not a boss. Well worth the read though.
B001609SQA|5.0|Aliens is a true classic. I don't really like typical horror movies (predictable plots with tons of blood and gore), but Aliens is different. If you're at all a fan of science fiction, watch this movie!
B000FC1AGG|4.0|If you likes Bridgette Jones stories, where the bumbling female lead comes off as endearing to the most eligible bachelor in town, then you will love this book.<br /><br />Every woman wants to be courted like this and every woman wants her story to turn out this way.<br /><br />You won't broaden your vocabulary. You won't be better for having read it. You won't be changed forever. It's a cheesy escape and you'll have fun reading it. I did.
B0078N2MTE|1.0|The movie seemed like it was going to eventually get interesting, but somehow never did. It was a little strange and the acting was good, but that can't make up for the fact that nothing really happens in this movie. I really wanted to see it, the trailers hooked me in and in the end I was just happy the movie was over. I can sum this movie up in one word, \\"Boring.\\"
0307346617|3.0|I wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't get into it. The whole time I was reading, I was waiting for that moment in a book where you start to get sucked in, and it never happened. Many of the chapters I found flat out boring because they revolved around politics/details within the armed forces and the government. These parts felt pretty bloated and made my eyes glaze over, some of it was intriguing but mostly a borefest. I quickly found myself skimming these parts. I got about 1/3 through the book when I realized that if I'm skimming pages already, why should I bother forcing myself to keep reading just for the sake of finishing? I feel the book was well written, but I agree with some other reviewers... I also found the format to work against the book as a whole. Besides hearing about the emotional parts, how it was effecting actual people and characters, I wasn't often emotionally invested in many of the stories. I didn't really care to read pages about the inner workings of the government/politics from the point of view of an army general. Maybe I didn't give it much of a chance, but I wish it were more stories like in the beginning where it felt more human/relatable. I'd rather read a book that I have trouble putting down, and this was not not one of them for me. This zombie fad is getting tired, I'd much rather close this book and watch The Walking Dead.

B002UXRGLG|5.0|The DVD is just wonderful. It's a great educational experience to watch it. you can watch it hundreds of times, and you wont get tired of it. All you need is love for nature and a curious mind. I wont mind watching this on my first date. Hats off to David Attenborough, he is a great narrator.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good games, like the points system. would enjoy more if games were made better. overall good app. worth buying. interesting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|yep its good in all. some games are lame. I just want the points for submitting a review.  I like games
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book because it was listed among the most popular books bought on Amazon.  It was completely different than anything I had ever read before and one of those books that you cannot put down.  I have not got to read part 2 and 3 yet but I am sure that they are equally as exciting.  Just back from the States and I have seen Hunger Games advertised a lot as it is coming out as a film.  Very exciting.  Definitely worth reading..
B005H2IAM6|5.0|I loved the cartoon series and was so excited to see they made a live action movie! It is pure sci-fi fun. I really enjoyed the changes to the story line and the graphics are on par with current sci-fi movies. I highly recommend this for people who can enjoy a great foreign sc-fi film without over analyzing. I only wish it had a sequel!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good to pass time.  Having to unlock games keeps you going.  I like that you can review how to play before choosing which game to unlock.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I cried when I heard he died, even though he was not my friend or my relative. He is famous and I had thought I knew a lot about him, but actually I didn't. I knew nothing about him. I liked him before I read this book.  Now I still like him maybe in a little different way.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|This case covers everything on your phone that you'd expect it to: the top, bottom, left, right, back, and even some of the front (a major selling point for me since I absolutely love dropping my phone). It's just slightly bulkier than my old case, but much sturdier.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 mainly because dust gets trapped in the back relatively easy. Being that the case is clear, it takes away from the overall look. Also, it gets quite a bit warm while charging. Otherwise, this case is amazing.<br /><br />For anyone that's wondering, TPU stands for Thermoplastic polyurethane. TPU is sort of a bendable, stretchable plastic. The case is all one piece that you stretch on to your iPhone after you put on the screen protector that comes with it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Mesmerizing, couldn't put the book down. I was enthralled by the whole series. I wish the story didn't end on the 3rd book. The combination of old and future  was a terrific and clever idea by the author. By the way, I'm a senior citizen and a male, not a young, female reader, so we can surmise that the story has the kind of universal appeal that makes a true best seller. I can't wait for the movie to come out to see how close it gets to the storyline; not that a movie can convey what words can. I don't think that \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\" is true all of the time.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|the directions say &quot;point and look&quot; but all you can do is look on a kindle fire...and scroll/compass manually with your fingers.  very misleading reviews!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This movie deserves a sequel (or two)!<br />Nicely paced for a somewhat epic story, this film introduces the human protagonist, puts him on Mars, then brings on the Martians, all in fairly short order... then a world is saved.<br />Not a simple mess to organize into a 2 hour film, but the task is managed with humor, action, charm, and a fine Saturday matinee flair.<br />John Carter pays homage to just about every preceding Sci-Fi flick, and as Disney spared no expense, the visual candy is just about the finest spectacle Hollywood can produce... truly state-of-the-art CGI and 3D.<br />Don't chince on this one... pay the 15 bucks and see it in IMAX 3D! Until cinema begins to use 60 FPS or higher, this is as good as it gets!<br />Any kid or kid at heart is going to LOVE this movie!
B00064VR0W|5.0|Rod still is the best of the best showman I have seen. It is so fun to go back in time and watch him rock out once again.  Ah, the unbounding energy of youth!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|while this movie is not avater that does not mean that it is bad movie. Their are many good things about john carter. Granted the story needed some work their were plot wholes i think that they tried to set this up for a trilogy but it remains to be seen if they are going to make another john carter. There are some funny moments in the movie but nothing special. One thing that this movie does try to do is make john carter a anti-hero it works to some degree but many times falls flat. The ending battle scene is somewhat anti-climatic i though their would be a bigger battle scene then what there was. i will say this much after whatching john carter today and seeing other trailers for the movies that are going to be released this year we might be in for a very very sad year for movies this year(But again that does not mean that john carter was a bad movie it is by all means worth watching) only the avengers looks like it will live up to its promise of being a big movie. I do not hold out much hope for movies this year only the avengers i think will live up to its promise of being a big movie. I do not hold much hope for wrath of the titans because the trailers do not show much of anything but this is typical hollywood advertising for a movie but then again it could be a great film we shall see.
B002GJU54E|5.0|As always, Janet Evanovich has out done herself.  I have laughed so hard that I cried reading this book.  This is a must read for those who love to laugh.
B00280LYIC|5.0|one of the best books ever but I like the 5th one better I own the whole series and it is my second favorite seris next to harry potter and the dinosaur games by chrisopher gordan
B0063IH60K|4.0|great app.only problem I have is not being able to see a shuffle. some of the reshuffles come up with almost no difference in the layout.@
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was great.  After reading The Hunger Games, Catching Fire did not disappoint.  The action continues with lots of exciting twists.  Fabulous read.
B005OYKI1I|4.0|A very good action movie... good cars and effects!!! The extended part I never see it, but the movie it's good!!!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Fun and simple game. Good value and quick session play time. Keep up the good work. level 28 is a tough one
0736092269|5.0|I did not want to spend the money and buy this book since I have the Core Training but unfortunately they are not the same muscles. I am into many different sports as well as weight lifting. This is not just a few pages of black and white paperback publication... It has many, many pages of drawings of human body with muscles in every single page, with the name of each muscle including the ones being impacted in a red colour for that particular recommended exercise. I have been weigh lifting for some time, I do not know the name of every single muscle and this is the best dictionary I could ever get. Worth every single penny. Double Bravo.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Very fun. Makes waiting time fly. good quick game. Hope more levels coming out soon! I Like a game that gets u thinking
B005FITIK0|1.0|I was expecting a comedy when I got this out of Redbox.  Normally, Reitman is funny, but there is not one laugh in this entire film.  This has absolutely no socially redeeming qualities.  It's just depressing and unwatchable.
0689835604|5.0|This book is absolutely adorable!  My 12 month old loves it to death!  Unlike many of today's children's books that have \\"morals\\" to the story that are often designed to indoctrinate our children with what are IMO very liberal \\"values\\" this book is just plain educational fun.  Baby learns body parts and the book is adorable.  My daughter loves the peek-a-boo style flaps.  Plus it's sturdy enough that she doesn't ruin it trying to chew on it!
1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson's book about Steve Jobs ia a keeper. I can't put it down! It's excellent and a quick read, very informative about Steve Jobs' life and philosophy. Very interesting and valuable especially if your own your own business or plan to soon.
B0052GVGYG|4.0|Fantastic album. One of those albums that gets better the more you listen to it. Convinced me to buy tix to see them in concert. Trucks is a great guitar player. Does some fantastic fills throughout.
1591795230|5.0|Bruce Lipton is an engaging speaker who takes you beyond the mundane and usual. He is truly a scientist not caught up in the dogma of science or religion. He seeks truth and answers breaking boundaries making the unknown, known. I love this book.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|This is a review of the kindle trilogy formatting... I can't understand why the font sizes are different from every other kindle book I have. Disappointing. The smallest possible font size is a size or two larger than the usual... Basically makes this a large print book without telling you before you buy it. If you need large print, this is for you. (Although every kindle book has larger font sizes if you want them.) Otherwise, if you usually read in small type face, I'd buy a different version. :(
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been using this app for about 2 years &amp; it's awesome! I love the reading plans--there is definitely something for everyone.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Bought this for a person who loves this show. While I am not familiar witht eh show and cannot review the item, the gift recipient loved it.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Deceptively simple, but occasionally brain-teasing batch of physics and timing puzzles that may have you scratching your head a bit before you have the &quot;A-ha!&quot; epiphany. One of the better free A'zon apps I've gotten. Now if only I could figure out the one I'm currently stuck on...
0783230079|5.0|I JUST HAPPENED TO CATCH PARTS OF THIS MOVIE ON CABLE AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE I HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD ABOUT THIS FILM.  THE CAST IS SUPERB.  I WOULD SAY THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF ROBERT DOWNEY JR.  A LOT OF GOOD MESSAGES AND A TERRIFIC 'FEEL GOOD' FILM.  THIS HAS BECOME ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE FILMS!  I WAS THRILLED WHEN THE DVD ARRIVED AND WAS PACKAGED SO WELL THAT I COULD ADD THIS TO MY LIBRARY OF FILMS.
B004UHF51S|5.0|Memo to Michael Franks: I defy you to disappoint me. Every time I pick up one of your CDs I think that surely there's got to be an ordinary song in there somewhere. But no, there isn't.<br /><br />I've bought all your albums and no doubt helped put your kids through school, so I'm well qualified to offer an opinion.<br /><br />It's the same old thing every time - brilliant compositions, superbly arranged and performed that leave me wanting more.<br /><br />Sometimes I detect a touch of Jobim, a touch of Blossom Dearie and even Cole Porter (I bet you were channelling his ghost when you wrote Laughing Gas).<br /><br />I enjoy all your styles, but I like the Latin stuff most of all.<br /><br />I think \\"Samba Blue\\" and \\"No that Summer's Here\\" on this set are among your 100 best bossa nova style songs.<br /><br />I would just love to hear you do an album with Sergio Mendes ... half your compositions and half Brasil 66 classics.<br /><br />Just a thought.<br /><br />Yes, five stars because you never disappoint
0439023521|2.0|Over the last year and a half, I have tried, I really have tried, to finish this book. I never could get past page 150 after four attempts. I set it down for about five months and saw the movie trailer recently and thought I should give it a shot again. I gave up on page 114.<br /><br />Not one star because it isn't that bad, I got the gist of why it's so popular, and primarily a matter of personal taste. After trying to read two other similar books people recommended me and gave those a try, I realized these type of books are not for me. I could not give it three stars because I can not recommend this book.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|all it does is tells you weather like its the only thing it does. its so hard to use its like shoving a nook in you face and expecting you yo already know go read it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to purchase and read this book before the upcoming movie was released.  It kept me on the edge throughout the whole book.  It was an easy read, but really, if you think about it quite sinister.  I'm looking forward to finishing the series.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I play this CD over and over almost daily. They were new to me and I had given them a shot due to previewing them on Amazon. So glad I did, their music gets me going on my drive to work most days.
B0066W1AZK|2.0|There are virtually no options or customizations in the game. There is no highlighting of potential moves or check. You cannot see pieces that have been removed. All in all, below average compared to what is available for free.
B0060Q962Q|3.0|Excellent game play, my 4-in-a-row skill improved by playing this, but it crashes every third or fourth game I play.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|We missed a lot of the earlier episodes so for Christmas we got the first four seasons to catch up and share the series with our teenager. No extras but hilarious. Recently watched a NOVA episode on string theory an then watched a BBT that discussed the same thing!

0316019984|5.0|This is an amazingly beautiful pop-up book.  The technique that is used to create each page is just wonderful, colorful, and complex.  The Bat-signal actually lights up.  It IS fragile, so I would recommend it for older kids or for adults.  Little children will have this apart in no time.  But it is a real pleasure to turn each page and to see the creativity involved.
0345444051|5.0|This is a well-written, stellar novel based on a fascinating premise that will leave you wishing for more. You'll see how others that came after Clarke borrowed from his novel to write their own amazing stories.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I ordered this item because I did not realize how much space the Kinect needs. My living room is long and narrow so it was a problem. Only one player was able to play...<br />So, I ordered this item and installed it (which was easy), started my x-box 360 and tried a few of my kinect games.<br />Have to say WOW...it works great..now me and my grand son can play, dance...whatever. Love this item!!! :) I greatly recommend it!<br />My Kinect stands on the cabinet in front of my flat screen. I seen some bad reviews from people that have the kinnect mounted on top of the TV. IDK all I can say it works great for me!
B0063GORYU|5.0|great app.  easy to play and a great way to bide your time.  just like playing spider solitaire on your computer.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|BEST GAME EVER AND VERY ADDICTING!!!!<br />IF I WERE U I WOULD GET THIS GAME NO QUESTION ABOUT.IT!!!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!!<br />ITS: ADDICTING, AWESOME, FUN, CHALLENING, INTERESTING, FREE, GOOD.TIME WASTER(if needed) &amp; OVER ALL 1 OF HE BEST GAMES.I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY.LIFE
0545265355|1.0|I just finished the last book and I can honestly say that I wish I would have never started this series. After reading the first and second book you really have to read the next book because they end with cliff hangers. If you don't know what these books are about I will tell you to sum it all up, it's about the government murdering children (all ages and to often in gory detail)Usually I'm not overly effected by sad/scary movies or books but there were scenes in the final book, Mockingjay that kept me from sleeping and when I did finally manage to fall asleep I had horrible dreams about young children being killed. Like the previous books weren't shocking and heart breaking enough Collins really tried to out do herself and see just how horrible she could make the Mokingjay (maybe trying for a grand finale) and let me tell you with the scene in front of the president's palace she certainly succeeds. Like I said.... wish I would have never read it. Some things are to disturbing, even in books.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so much fun!!! there's a lot of different types.of games like :<br />1. zen mode<br />2. classic mode<br />3. arcade mode<br />  and it will give u an.option if u want. to download the newest version which includes:<br />1. classic mode<br />2. zen mode<br />3. arcade mode &amp;<br />4. online -vs- mode (where u get online and battle other live players!!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book ; it was long and I didn't sit up all night to finish it but very enjoyable none the less
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought this app would not be as fun as it said but when I downloaded it and played I thought &quot;wow this is awesome and it was actually telling me the truth and not.just spamming me!!! I would definatly recommend this for.anyone who likes to play games!! and a good time waster if needed!!!:)
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Thanks for a fun challenge.  Can't wait to challenge my daughter with it.  Works well on my Kindle Fire.  Seems it could be addictive.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|well its the holy Bible shouldn't it be.free to everyone to use without having to have ur.info.????? I mean really!<br />I just recently read.this review and it was talking about how it constantly. running and how even when u go to settings.or whateverr and think u shut it off wait a while and without turning. it on look and c if it is still running and then boom it will b!!!! I tried and I believe this guy 10000000000000000 percent!!!! DO NOT GET THIS APP!! IF U WANT TO READ HE HOLY BIBLE GO GET ONE AT HASTINGS&reg; OR SOMETHING PLUS THEY MAKE ONES.THAT R WAY SMALLER THAN A KINDLE
0385534639|5.0|When someone recommended this, I thought a circus story would be boring. But this is no ordinary circus. There are star-crossed lovers, exquisite clockmakers,  fantastical illusionists....Reading The Night Cirus is a genuine escape from reality...filled with love, magic, and fantasy!
1847879071|5.0|I ordered this book after I found myself struggling with my statistic classes. I'm currently in a PhD program for psychology, so it's very heavy on the stats. This book helped immensely and I'm finally starting to really understand what was once an alien language, to me. The author explains everything in a conversational tone....not like your average stats book. He gives real world examples for all the analyses and goes through the basic run-down of how to compute it all with SPSS. The only drawback is that he doesn't get into syntax at all, but that's non-essential and you typically learn that through messing with the drop-down menus. There are a few areas that could be explored a bit further, so I can't recommend this book as an end-all-be-all package. If you're in a grad program, you'll need the assigned textbook for more in-depth explanation. However, I bet you anything that you'll be reading through this far more often and will learn most of what you need in doing so. With its 800 pages, it will cover all the major analyses and walk you through computation. So, if you're looking for something more accessible than your tortuous academic stats textbook.....get this book. You wont regret it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun simple games. easy to earn points to unlock other games. Apparently negative reviewers didn't read description. I would get this app.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|This movie is delightful - educational and entertaining! To be enjoyed by all ages - kids and adults alike. You'll want to see it over and over.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The old Steven King is back.  This is the best book I've read in awhile.  I felt like I went right back in time with the main character.
0446547654|1.0|This is the absolute worst Sparks book ever. If you are an avid sparks reader, like me, you know how his stories are going to go. You have to expect some heart ache and some death - but seriously?? The ending was SO predictable and SO bad! Thank Goodness I borrowed the book from the library and didn't actually spend a cent on it. However, I am still mad that I wasted my time. I liked the basic plot, but stop killing people with cancer, and stop tearing apart the people who should be together in the end. Would it kill you to write a happy ending for once? People have enough drama and crap in their every day lives - they don't need to read about it in one of your books. Maybe give us some hope in this otherwise depressing world. If they make this one into a movie I will boycott it. I will tell everyone I know that he ending is HORRIBLE and not to go see it.
B000SGSU58|5.0|As usual Detective Bosch is diligently doing what he does best, being a detective.  Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors and he brings Detective Bosch to life.  Once I start one of his books I can't seem to put it down until I've read the last page.  Love reading on my Kindle Fire.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I enjoyed Grisly Manor, for the 45 minutes it took to finish it, but they took care of that complaint with this one. I really enjoyed this game, it was challenging, but not too challenging. The graphics were good, the storyline interesting, and there is even an embedded hint button if you really need it. Worth every penny!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love the game. its an addiciting and fun way to pass time. I only wish that there was free offers for money
1594744769|3.0|but it wasn't.  It was entertaining, but not as enchanting as I'd hoped. I liked the peculiar children idea, and the setting...but the overall concept just made it too over the top.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love the game solitaire. but to many pop ups while playing the game. its way to Much. so that's my review
0385534639|3.0|This book is beautifully written. The scenes are described magically, and I'd find myself closing my eyes and trying to picture this incredible circus. Somehow, though, I finished the book feeling let down. I would have liked to have seen the protagonists developed more, perhaps cutting out a few of the lesser  characters or scenes. I did enjoy reading this book, but in the end I simply felt that something was terribly missing.
0743454537|5.0|Ms. Picoult writes with unflinching honesty as she offers up a story overlooking what can make of a family ridden with scars, both physical and emotional.<br />  The toleration of each character is played as very risky, but in this way, the characters' deepest emotions are displayed, making each and every detail easier to see.  The precision of words chosen varies on age and trait structure.  Such as the teenage Jesse, who is in his pubescent years, still not let out into his adult years.  This makes his attitude very agile and concupiscent (amative).  Anna is very curious, as any thirteen year old would be, but also has her own sense of agression, as being a 13 year-old teenage girl.  And Sara, who has a sense of maturity, which, enveloped inside, is a very childish side that comes out frequently, as she is more often stressed.<br />  Ms. Picoult is very able to prove a point when she pens her novels, and more likely the cases, to a certain extent, are able to be understood more by the people who are affected with certain illnesses she explains in her novels.  Likewise, Ms. Picoult has a very natural sense of maturity, which she puts into her work.  Ms. Picoult has shown her most sensitive side in My Sister's Keeper, something rare, when watching the words transform into a video in your mind while others make it so hard to get a sense of what the author was thinking when she wrote this piece.<br />  I hope this helps readers not sure about characters and Ms. Picoult's intense and sometimes flawless writing style.
0439023513|1.0|Sorry if the following makes you upset I just get really disappointed when something popular fails so miserably.  It pushes me over the edge.  It feels like the publisher and author knew that it was going to sell no matter what so they just put out a first draft as quickly as they could. When reading the trilogy you should stop at the second book and then just make up your own ending.<br /><br />Do I need to go explain or will you just trust me?<br /><br />I can tell from the way you are reading this that you need me to explain. You have probably heard from a lot of your friends that the entire trilogy is awesome and that the third book is the best of the bunch. Feel free to keep reading but don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />You are probably wondering how bad it is so I'll ask you a question to try and show you.<br /><br />How do you win a revolution?<br /><br />If you answered \\"Fight to overthrow the government\\" then you would be right. We've all seen Star Wars. We know the good guys fight the bad guys until the evil government is gone.<br /><br />That's not what happens in Mockingjay. There is fighting going on but rarely from the protagonist's POV.<br /><br />Instead they have her making propaganda commercials.<br /><br />What?<br /><br />It's like reading the behind the scenes of a negative political ad campaign, except way more frustrating because you know there is a war going on that would be way more entertaining than reading about how to make commercials. So lame.<br /><br />The revolution is on the back burner for most of the book. Instead the focus is on the commercials, Katniss having a hard life because of blah blah whatever, and her choosing between Pita Pit and the other guy (I've already forgotten his name).<br /><br />Katniss being sad about her life is just about the most boring thing in the world to read. I don't care if that's what she would be like in real life. It is boring and I don't want to read about. The districts are rising up against their oppressors, why can't we read more about that?<br /><br />When we finally get to the action it's vague and unimaginative. There was never a moment when I could picture what was going on in my head or a moment when , after a minute or two, I couldn't think of something more interesting. Instead of being creative and entertaining the author resorted to being unnecessarily gory when characters finally started dying.<br /><br />Don't even get me started with Prim. That was supposed to be a major turning point in the book? Was that a climax? Instead of storming the castle we have to read that? Are you kidding me? I don't know what's worse, having to read that or reading it and not caring in the slightest.<br /><br />But it's not all bad. There was one lonely improvement in this book from the other ones. Pita Pit wasn't just some star-crossed lover who never did anything. In this book he is a crazy person who can't tell reality from what he was brainwashed to believe. The real or fake game they play to help him learn what's real was the only part of the book I thought was good.<br /><br />Do you want to know the very worst thing about this book?<br /><br />It's been optioned for two movies.  As with all young adult books being turned into movies it will be split into two so instead of one unwatchable movie we are going to have two.  Nothing happens in the first half of the book. I can't imagine what the movie is going to be about.  If I end up watching it I might have to download a new iPhone game to keep me amused.  By the way, Angry Birds tells a better and more interesting story than Mockingjay.<br /><br />You've been warned. This book is no good.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I am so upset.  I wanted to read the reviews of this third book before ordering it and to my horror.....the first paragraph of the review gives away the ending.  NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! I didn't want to see that.  The spoiler alert needs to be posted in the first line folks.<br /><br />Booooo!!!
0439023491|5.0|The second book or movie in a trilogy is usually the weakest of the three.  This is true for almost every trilogy except for the original Star Wars, where Empire Strikes Back is the best of all the movies.  After a perfectly average opening to The Hunger Games I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of the rest of the series.  The only reason I kept reading was because I bought a kindle.  This book was only seven bucks and near the top of the list in the kindle store so I figured \\"why not.\\"<br /><br />Now I can think of two trilogies where the second book is the best of the series, Star Wars and The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Catching Fire kind of cheats though because it has two climaxes.  For some reason that escapes me, the book one climax is in the beginning of book two.  The book one climax occurs when Snow is talking to Katniss in her new house.  It's a solid scene and made me excited to read the rest of the book.  It's the scene that needed to end off the first book so that I would have been more eager to read the rest of these kid killing stories.<br /><br />The plot of the second book starts out with Katniss and Peeta (still the worst character names of all time, especially Pita Pit Peeta as I call him) going around to all the districts on a victory tour after winning the Hunger Games.  I loved where it was going with this.  They started at district 11 and what happened there was the most solid story telling in the trilogy. The only other comparable scene was at the beginning of this book with Katniss and Snow.  If this is what happened at the first district then I couldn't wait to see what happened in the other districts.  Too bad they don't really talk about it too much.  Everything gets skimmed over.<br /><br />This is the beginning of a trend that plagues the rest of the books.  Skimming.  Instead of saying what goes on she just sums things up so that you know all the important parts and she can spend some unnecessary time trying to make me care if Katniss ends up with Peeta or the other guy.  I'm sure he has a name but his role in the books is \\"the other guy.\\"  The skimming isn't as bad in Catching Fire but in the third book it is beyond an acceptable level.<br /><br />Despite this there are still lots of things to love about this book.  Of course Katniss and Peeta end up back in the games fighting for their lives.  I knew this would happen before I read the book.  It's on the back cover isn't it?  So I wasn't excited because I wasn't sure how the stakes could be raised any higher than they were the first time.<br /><br />The author was able to do that by, surprise surprise, being creative with the arena the game was being played in.  The arena was amazingly entertaining compared to the first book where the location barely had a factor in how the game was played.<br /><br />She also raised the stakes by complicating the relationships between the people playing the game.  Using the old victors as the tributes raised the stakes because they all knew each other and some were even good friends, but the added factor was that some of them weren't playing the game the way the Capital thought they were playing.  It's all a little complicated.  I don't expect you to understand what's going on.  The protagonist doesn't even understand what's going on half the time.<br /><br />I love the very last line of the book. It sets up a massive cliff hanger which was absolutely perfect and ended the book on just the right level of hopelessness that the second part of any three part story needs.<br /><br />The Hunger Games in Catching Fire are the best of the series.  The climax at the end of the book is the best of the series.  The characters are the least annoying in this book.  The settings are the most interesting, and finally, and most importantly the story is the most entertaining.s up with Peeta or the other guy.

0307949508|5.0|Following in the footsteps of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Stieg Larsson does it again. Weaving an exciting tale and luring you into complete absorption page after page to the end. The second book delivers like the first and launches you right into the third installment of the trilogy (reading now; The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest). The only criticism I have is that Lisbeth, albeit her admirable qualities, is a little too super-hero. I highly doubt if anyone could survive the trials she endures at the end of the book, which diminishes the believability of that part of the story. Anyway: Great distraction, great cure for boredom. Highly recommend if you liked the first one.
0439023521|4.0|Hey I'm reviewing that book that everyone has already read.  It's the number one book on Amazon right now and it's sure to stay there until Ronos Part I: Catalyst comes out later this year. I bet you're dying to know what I think about The Hunger Games.  Since everyone has already read this there are going to be some major SPOILERS throughout this review.<br /><br />There were things about it that I liked and there were things about it that I didn't like (Duh!).  If you don't know me then I should tell you that I'm very critical of things that a ton of people like.  I hold those books/movies/TV shows to a higher standard than others.  As a result it often seems like I hate the things that everyone else loves.<br /><br />I didn't love The Hunger Games.  Please don't judge me.  Does it help if I tell you that I didn't hate it either?<br /><br />There were a lot of good things about it.  I love the setting of the world.  The country being set up into districts and being run by the capital was cool for me and I was a little jealous of the authors ingenuity.  By having the POV character not knowledgable about the other districts meant she didn't have to have pages and pages about exposition about what the major industries and cultures of the districts were.  Also, if she needed to change anything for the sake of the story she could just pretend like the protagonist was misinformed about what she knew.  It's a good writing strategy.<br /><br />We got to know a lot about district 12 and very little about any of the others.  That left a lot of mystery and intrigue to the world of the story.  The setting alone was interesting enough to keep reading.<br /><br />I think that along with the setting goes the sweet story setup for why the districts are the way they are.  The Capital runs everything everyone does to remind them about how all powerful the government is.  Just in case that isn't enough each district is also to send two kids to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games.  Twenty-four teenagers and kids trying to kill each other; the last won standing wins. That's cool.  Sure to bring an appropriate amount of antagonism to the story.<br /><br />The main character is Katniss Everdeen and she volunteers for The Hunger Games so that her little sister doesn't have to fight.  Katniss is a solid protagonist.  She does a lot of thinking.  Lots of the story beats take place in her head (which is why the movie is going to be lacking compared to the book) especially in the first book.  Most of the in her head stuff is about her relationship with Peeta (who has a terrible name).<br /><br />Which leads to the weakest thing about this book and the entire trilogy.  Peeta and the love story is straight up annoying.  Suzanne Collins is a good writer.  She knows how to describe things in a unique way and there was never a moment where I thought she wasn't trying to do a good job, except for this cheezy love story.<br /><br />Now I'm not one of those guys who is automatically opposed to any love story in everything.  I enjoy anything that is well written.  I'm saying that the love story feels so out of place with The Hunger Games story. I can see what they were going for.  They wanted someone in the games that was going to be very hard for Katniss to kill.  That's a good idea.  But the way they do it is no good.<br /><br />And there is a reason I'm saying they instead of her, the author.  The way it reads it almost feels like she doesn't know how to write those drenched in love lines that Peeta constantly rolls out.  She is so good everywhere else in the book why does she falter when talking about how much Peeta is in love with Katniss.  Most of what he says feels like a clich&eacute;.  So I'm saying they because it reads like that was something the publisher told her to include in a rewrite because for some reason in every young adult fiction the lead girl has to make a choice between two guys who both love her more than any teenager has everloved anyone.<br /><br />The choice plot is now a clich&eacute;, not a convention.  Please stop boring me.<br /><br />The choice plot makes me upset because it's used as the climax of the first book.  That made me so mad I decided I wouldn't read the other ones.  There was no way that's supposed to be the climax of book one.  I changed my mind a few months later and read the second one where I found the real climax for book one.  It's the conversation Katniss had with President Snow in case you are wondering and it needs to be included in the first movie if you want to do it right.<br /><br />The games themselves were entertaining enough but they could have been better.  All the things I didn't like Collins improved for the second book.  I didn't like the supplies they needed dropping in exactly when they needed them.  It was kind of explained but not well enough.  It was a little Dues ex machina and was a lazy way to move the story forward.<br /><br />The best stuff of the actual Hunger Games was between Katniss and Rue. It was sad when that ended because then I knew it would go back to that lame love story.<br /><br />One last thing.  For a story about kids killing each other until there is only one left standing the climax in the arena was pretty anticlimactic.  I guess in the back of my mind I knew that there were two more books and that Katniss and Peeta had to survive.  There's nothing wrong with that but one of the principles of story telling is giving the audience what they want but not in the way they want.  There was never really a moment where I was excited about what was going to happen next.  It was always just Katniss and Peeta killing everyone else.  My interest spiked a little when it was down to just the two of them but it should have been spiking a lot higher for where I was in the book.<br /><br />A lot of the things I didn't like about this book might sound kind of petty and most people don't care about them.  It's still a good enough book and I still think you should read it if you have nothing better to read.<br /><br />By the way if you do have something better to read let me know what it is.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was intriguing to read, your imagination can run wild picturing the circus and it's characters. The wonder was how it would tie together in the end and it does.
0375869026|5.0|August Pullman burrowed under my skin and punched me in my tear ducts pretty early on in this book. Maybe it was his Star Wars obsession, or his sense of humor, or his general spirit that captured me but it was probably all three--and so much more. As a kid with craniofacial abnormalities, he's heard it all, all the awful names kids (and adults) can come up with. He's seen all the horrified looks. Until this year, though, he'd never been to school. Wonder follows Auggie as he starts his year until he graduates from the fifth grade.<br /><br />The story is told from multiple viewpoints: Auggie, his sister, her boyfriend, her sister's ex-best friend, and two of Auggie's friends from school. The technique worked for me in this case, as it was fascinating to see events from different perspectives and to feel what each character was feeling. I keep trying to decide which narrator I enjoyed hearing from the most but they each gave me something to think about: What it means to be comfortable, how much influence parents have on their children's personalities, how taking one minute to do something for someone else can make all the difference. I sound like a motivational speaker right now. Treat everyone with kindness! Teach your kids to look beyond looks! Let's all just take care of each other!<br /><br />Middle grade books are hit or miss for me. I truly feel they must be some of the hardest books to write; children's books as well. Conveying messages to impressionable age groups while still telling an engaging and well-constructed story is a feat. I can see how some readers may view this book as heavy-handed or forcing moral values. I guess I just didn't see it. The book reads like what it is supposed to read like: A book about a young boy who is and manages to remain a wonderful and caring human being despite being subjected to numerous events that would make me want to go weep in my room. I think children are smart enough to know that not every child in Auggie's situation is surrounded with so many wonderful people. They go to school. They know that other kids are not always nice, especially to anyone who deviates from whatever is \\"normal\\" (if anything is normal). If books for children always told the truth, far more kids in books would be picked up by sex traffickers, be in abusive households, and struggle with food insecurity. Believing that the universe will take care of everyone is a bit delusional - that is not the case. But teaching children to believe that good things can happen to everyone and that there are more kind than evil people in the world? I don't see the harm in that.<br /><br />There is a fine line between playing on the emotions of your readers and emotional manipulation. I'm not a big crier in books - I can only think of three or four books that have made me tear up at all - but I cried several times in this book. (On a plane, no less!) I think there was only one segment of the book that felt overdone and that had to do with the family dog. And while I may or may not have snuggled with my dog after I read that section, I didn't cry because I'm not sold on the necessity of that portion of the book. However, I will concede that the dog's character provided the perfect vehicle to introduce discussions of blind love and souls/bodies and those were highlights for me. (Hearing Auggie's thoughts about maybe coming back as a handsome man broke my heart a little bit.) The only other thing that didn't work for me was the usage of song lyrics. Then again, I've never been the biggest Natalie Merchant fan. I thought this book was wonderful (pun initially unintended but I'm leaving it in so I guess there is intent behind it now) and I absolutely recommend it to parents and teachers who would like to read something worthwhile and inspirational with children as well as to any readers who enjoy middle grade books.n is surrounded with so many wonderful people.

030788743X|4.0|This book is nostalgia porn. If you grew up in the 80s, enjoy video games, or go crazy for popular culture, you will devour this one. I was supposed to be reading this with a friend but I couldn't stop. I read the beginning and thought, \\"what's the big deal with everyone's obsession?\\" Then Ernest Cline got his meat hooks into me and I read it while I was making dinner, while I was eating dinner, and then afterward until I'd finished it. I think I am just a few years shy of this books prime audience but I can see how it will appeal to most of my fellow geeks friends. Ready Player One is set in a future where we have depleted our resources to the point where many people lives in Stacks, which are basically just trailer homes piled 20+ high and many people struggle to make ends meet. Wade Watts, the protagonist, attends school in OASIS like many of his peers. OASIS, an online world created by James Halliday contains thousands of different worlds, including copies of many famous sci-fi verses--I'm sure you could spend most of your time in Sunnydale or on Dune if you wanted to. In a very [[ASIN:B003ZZ543K The Westing Game]] move, Halliday leaves his entire $250 billion fortune to the player who can find the Easter egg hidden in OASIS. The book is set five years after his death and no player has gotten even one step closer to figuring out Halliday's mystery. And the kicker? Halliday's obsession, besides video games, was the 1980s. All the kids and adults alike are well-versed in all things 1980s from fashion to music to games to computers. These characters know more about the 1980s than most people who lived through it.<br /><br />Wade Watts has spent years playing through all of Halliday's favorite games and songs trying to figure out the first step. When Wade figures out the first move, his name shoots to the top of a previously empty high-scorers list and the world goes into a frenzy. The entire rest of the book follows Wade and his fellow contestants through the game in their attempts to reach the goal first. It seems like every person in the world is up against each other--especially the \\"gunters\\" (egg hunters) and the \\"sixers.\\" (Corporately-sponsored hunters who want to take over the OASIS for monetary gain, so-called because their avatar names begin with the number 6) My adrenaline ran high for the whole book. In fact, I actually kept speaking to Wade aloud. \\"Wade, what the heck are you doing? You are past the first gate! Pull your head out of your ass and stop spending your time at dance parties!\\" \\"Art3mis is so much smarter than you, Wade!\\" Wade's fellow gunters include his long-time online crush, Art3mis and his BFF Aech (pronounced like the letter H). They were seriously awesome side characters with distinct personalities, which I especially enjoyed considering I have several friends online whom I've never met in real life but I feel like I know pretty well.  My experience with WoW and Second Life is pretty minimal...well, I did once try Second Life but it mostly consisted of my friends and I goofing around and then accidentally wandering into an orgy and getting yelled at. Anyway, my point is that people quest all the time and talk to the same people regularly online. They have distinct personalities. I'm so happy that Ernest Cline was able to capture the personalities so well when the characters were only together outside of OASIS for limited amounts of time.<br /><br />As someone who has spent probably entire weeks of her life playing video games, this book feels a bit like validation.

This book is fun, fun, fun (til her daddy takes the T-bird away). It has a very similar feeling to its companion novel Anna and the French Kiss--a teenage girl who already has a boyfriend falls for a guy who seems practically perfect in every way, except his family doesn't appreciate him as much as they should. The current boyfriend is sort of a douchebag and plays in a band and the protag is quirky. The main character in this one, Delores (Lola) Nolan, lives with her two dads in San Francisco. (Remember that show `My Two Dads'? I totally forgot about it until this moment) She loves fashion and spends a ton of her time designing and sewing costumes and putting together all sorts of crazy outfits. In the first few pages, Lola sees a moving truck and I think it is no spoiler who is moving in NEXT DOOR-- her love interest. (see: title of the book) Cricket Bell is tall, stylish, and always inventing all sorts of things. His family's been on the move a lot because his sister is a world-class figure skater and her career dominates the family. Lola's never gotten along with Calliope but she got along fine (*winkwinknudgenudge*) with Cricket before they moved away two years prior. That is, except for the last day she saw him. Now he's back and it is reconciliation time. There's only one boyfriend standing in the way.<br /><br />Lola frustrated me a bit because several of her problems are self-inflicted. I know it isn't always the easy thing to do but if you are dating someone and totally have the hots for someone else, you are a huge d-bag if you don't break it off. Sure, the other person's feelings will be hurt but no one likes looking like a fool after the fact. I did like Lola as a character but I wish/ed that she would man up, stop leading Cricket on, and be a better friend to Lindsay.<br /><br />Anna and St. Clair make much more of an appearance than I thought they would. They actual show up throughout the entire novel and it was a plus and minus situation for me. I was happy to see characters I knew but I have probably read 100 books since Anna and I no longer remembered the details of their true love always and forever relationship so their constant togetherness was a bit off-putting to me. Like those newish couples who are always PDAing all over the place.<br /><br />I'm a pretty huge sucker for boy next door stories. Or really any situation where someone awesome has been under the protag's nose for years. I hope I am not making it sound like I hated this book. I was annoyed with Lola quite a bit but I really LOVED most of this book. And you know what made this book even better for me? That my friends sent it to me with their comments written in it. I absolutely adored reading their thoughts and adding my own for people later on the tour list.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this and will keep reading anything Stephanie Perkins writes...but a little more than a little of me wants to see how she handles something other than this storyline.<br /><br />_________________________________________________<br /><br />Review #2:<br />You probably won't like this book.

I'm hoping they come out with some versions that have commentaries, cross references and a concordance.  I know they're available on desktop but haven't seen an app yet.  I love the ease of looking up specific Bible passages or switching to a different version.  The off-line downloadables make it so convienient in a group setting away from wi-fi.  The reading plans offer different options so the user can customize a program that fits them.  Thank you, YouVersion.

B007JF87VS|5.0|Finally I think we are seeing what Dr. Jenner was telling Rick back at the CDC. The virus has now mutated into a non-blood borne pathogen. This has nothing to do with the weapon being used with some sort of residual residue on it like when Rick is forced to stab Shane. If you remember, Shane broke the neck of the captured gunman, and he turned into a walker also, without any bites or scratches, just like at the public works facility and the two security guards. The look that Rick gave when he saw the two security guards reflected a look of \\"of course...I knew that\\".. He also gave the same look when confronted with seeing Shane become a walker as well. This is telling that perhaps the virus has now become an airborne virus, and no longer requires blood contact, like the avian and swine flu virus became. If this is the case, then the risk is even higher now. Anyone who came close to a walker and had them breathe into their face may now become a walker. At the public works facility, Rick had three walkers on top of him breathing into his face also. It will be interesting to see what happens next.<br /><br />The captured gunman told Shane that the camp he came from was 5 miles up the road. With all of the shooting going on around the farm, the people at that camp have to know that somewhere in the vicinity of this farm there are other people. This is going to bring the group of thirty to the farm for a huge showdown soon. Being in the Army for over 25 years, I can tell you that 5 miles is nothing when it comes to hearing a gunshot, especially alot of them. I would not put it past the director of the walking dead to have the group of thirty's leader none other than Merle, Darryl's brother.<br /><br />So, we have three threats now... The group of walkers coming across the field to the farm, The group of thirty, and the possible airborne virus confronting them. Everyone is at risk. So, this leads me to a very, very disturbing subject...<br /><br />Will Lori have her childas the first hybrid walker? Will the possible airborne threat enter through her bloodstream and create a baby who has already been infected as a walker? How is that for a WTF for you?

1401937519|4.0|I have read this book with some sense of awe, curiosity and some kind of skepticism.  The book is very well written and goes deep in the experience of Anita Moorjani and her struggles to fit in a place where she definitively does not belong. Her experience as an Indian lady living in Hong Kong under strong Chinese and British influence & trying to cope with Hindu religion and customs explain very well the struggles of any foreigner trying to fit in. I can testify that myself.<br /><br />She attributes her cancer to her inner fears and the fear to the disease. Her NDA experience while kind of traditional (unconditional love, peace, that cannot be explain by words and a sense to belong to a enhanced reality with no time in the way we understand it is kind of typical) what is not traditional at all is her astonishing and complete recovery from cancer.<br /><br />People having this disease and the readers usually looking for answer to our existential or physical struggles could be kind of disappointed that Anita does not provide a \\"recipe\\" for everyone to be cured or saved.<br />For one simple reason; her experience is unique, her struggles very particular and because her reflections are simple. For some reason we seem to struggle to follow simple ideas even though if they are powerful. The basic \\"Advice\\" is to be yourself (How many times our elders have told us that!) enjoy your life, accept yourself, who you are and don't be that hard with yourself. Let go because we live with the illusion that we are in control while we all know that we control almost nothing. Things will happen and all we can do is to accept it and even far beyond enjoyed...<br /><br />you will find all over the book the idea that you are a unique human being and the fact that you have the spark of life it is a testament of your own divinity. We struggle to look for answers and usually we look for them \\"outward\\" in others; experts, gurus, friends, etc  while most of those answers reside within ourselves \\"inwards\\" we feel inadequate, not good enough, a failure, especially if we live our lives trying to please others a task that nobody has ever done and never will, we compite instead of let go and go with the flow.<br /><br />Some people will find troubling that according to her experience even criminals, murderers, and rapist will share that \\"unconditional love\\" the day they will die. That there is not such a thing as a judgment because that universal unconditional love just want you to be yourself and in the big scheme of things you are a little trace in the tapestry of a reality that expands far beyond our intellectual knowledge, with knowledge we cannot grasp that reality we have to \\"Feel it\\".<br /><br />People with a structure religious belief could feel an aversion to that idea.<br />We have been told that we should comply with the rules and that breaking the rules have consequences. Those consequences according to catholic or Christian faiths leads to eternal condemnation in hell or purgatory or keep running through an endless cycle of birth and rebirth in the Hindu/Buddhist tradition.<br /><br />The truth is the sun - every morning - will shine for all of us even for the murderers and the criminals. The book also copes well with an idea that is troubling even to myself - be selfish in your love for yourself-. We have been told that sacrifices, helping others and put others ahead of us is something worthy and noble. In the book almost in every chapter lies the idea of that \\"Selfish love for yourself\\" because according to the author that's what you should do, be yourself and provide that divine entity with the essence of what you are. When you stop pretending being somebody else then the universe through \\"synchronicities\\" will provide you with all the opportunities that you deserve. You have to live your life fearlessly and authentically. Even though I don't share the particular view of being that \\"Selfish\\" - at least not yet - I find the book interesting,refreshing and inspiring.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|James Stewart is an \\"All American Actor\\", who goes out of his way for the woman and family he loves as well as for the people who made him the man he became. This movie is a sure classic drama for the whole family to enjoy.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this Game. I just wish there was more levels. Good graphics. Love Nom Nom! Some of the levels were really easy while others were really difficult.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical about this book since it's listed as Young Adult fiction, however I was happily surprised to find what a good story it actually was. Combine a quasi-post-apocalyptic era ruled by severe governmental control with a fierce and multi-dimensional female lead character (unlike the tripe pushed out by the Twilight series), and you have the ingredients for a very enjoyable piece of fiction. Can not wait to read the sequels.

B006P0FIGU|1.0|When I saw this movie I was hoping for a great swash buckling costume drama. That was not what I got.  This movie was ridiculous, that was really the only word for it. I cannot imagine what the people who put this thing together were thinking. The plot staggers all over the place without any substance. There is no drive to the story, no point to carry the story along. None of the heros made any connection with me, and did not leave me caring what happened to them. My impression of the King of France was to wonder why anyone would bother to fight for him.  The villians were just plain silly.  The Cardinal, supposed to be the main driving mastermind villan of the story, instead comes across as vague, bland and uninteresting.  The Duke of Buckingham was played more like a villain from an old cartoon show. There is a difference between comedy and farce, but you would not be able to tell that from this movie, which was pure farce.<br /><br />The sword fighting and special effects were nice to see, but nothing in the plot made any sense. The number of totally absurd things that happen are endless. You have whole fleets of flying boat/dirigibles, machine guns, flame throwers, intricate \\"Temple of Doom\\" type traps.<br /><br />Plus a Milady character who is a James Bond/Indiana Jones superspy. She slaughters an entire company of well armed musketeers in one scene, all while garbed in an elaborate French court gown, complete with nine layers of petty coats, and never even musses her hair. She sword fights better than Zorro, evades booby traps better than any cat burglar, again while never getting her wardrobe unsettled. And all of this happening in the 17th century!  And so on and so forth.  I like a good fantasy, but this was utterly ridiculous!<br /><br />It was a relief when this movie came to an end. If you like swashbucklers, or the Three Muskeeters, don't waste your time with this one.  If you are just curious, rent it but don't buy. It is not worth the time it took towatch.
B002NNA9N0|2.0|Great movie. The reason for the 2 star review was that the streaming playback on Amazon was so poor that the voices and action never synced up. We paid more attention to that after a while than the actual movie. Bummer...<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy a hard copy of this great movie or stream it on a less buggy platform.
0446547654|2.0|Let me preface this review with saying that I am a Nicholas Sparks fan, and usually enjoy his work despite the predictability of his books.  However, this book just didn't cut it for me and certainly was not his best work.  I should have gotten the jest that this was a difficult story to put on paper based on the opening acknowledgments.  This is a book that I could easily put down whenever I wanted, and it took me longer to finish than normal for his books - just couldn't get into the story and it felt like work reading.  I felt like the whole plot was simply the meshing of too many of his works - the love of Dawson and Amanda being frowned upon, the break-up of there relationship, Dawson's persistent pining away and never moving on with life, and then the only somewhat new theme of spirits leading the characters (although not new if you've read Safe Haven).  I think it is time for an original storyline from Sparks - even if it is a love-story maybe something that is differently developed than all of his past works.  I'll keep my fingers crossed for his next book to be better.
B00000K0EA|4.0|The main plot and villian is a tad weak, but Brosnan as Bond<br />has suddenly aged and lost his cute face, thus now abling<br />him to protray a darker and more serious Bond. You can see<br />him working hard at it, but that's good as long as he's<br />working.<br />And in this film he has a past. An old girlfriend that<br />got tired of him sleeping with his gun under his pillow.<br />Bond has regrets about losing her.<br /><br />007's possible love interest is Michelle Yeoh, who looks<br />great in both a wet t-shirt or formal wear. Their first<br />kiss is saved and climaxed brilliantly at the end.<br /><br />The production is first rate as are the action scenes.<br />Especially that helecopter coming blades first down the<br />street. The action goes over that top at times but with<br />both Brosnan and Yeoh, playing it straight and serious,<br />the scenes worked. And that's why I like this movie. It's<br />played straight and serious with Bond cold blooded at times<br />the way he was in Dr. No.<br /><br />Now that Brosnan's got it right for 007, he'll leave us<br />after one more outing. Leave us to who, I wonder?

B006ZT47O0|3.0|Epica has most indefinitely set the bar with their release of Design Your Universe in 2009. While it was possibly one of their most solid releases up to date, they also managed to make Requiem for the Indifferent sound bad in comparison. This unfortunately is an album that you will either love or hate. There seems to be quite a bit of debate on the metal forums whether or not they are great or just okay since we are all fans. I have listened to Epica for years and have all of their albums and I truly hate to say it, but this is possibly their worst release. The strange thing is it's not the music that's bad. The music they wrote for Requiem happens to be very reminiscent of Divine Conspiracy.<br /><br />So, what makes this album not that great? The excessive growling for one. While I know that Mark just loves adding them in, it really doesn't work with at least 80% of the songs on this album. I hardly remember what Simone was singing because I was too absorbed by the growling. This approach to music really worked well on every album they have released and even grew on me, except for this one. Why is that? I think because it was simply misplaced in most of the songs or unnecessary. Growling should be making a statement and not taking over the song.<br /><br />The second reason this release is remotely weak is because I just can't get into any of the songs. While a twist and turn in a song is good, these ones have too many for my taste. There is nothing catchy about any of the songs and truly, the only one I like so far is \\"Storm the Sorrow\\" and even that one I don't really like, just tolerate. I usually love EVERY song Epica writes, even the heavy ones that later grew on me. The songs on Requiem just have nothing catchy. There isn't a guitar solo that makes me listen, no epic moments with Simone singing and there isn't really anything that makes any of the tracks stand out.<br /><br />The last thing that made me feel rather down about this release is Simone's singing. There weren't really any soaring vocals or chilling moments. She sings just as well as any other time, but there were better choirs in their other releases and the songs themselves were more centered around her.  In some of the songs, I even felt like she was a tad strained to sing as high as the notes required. This could've all been made to work in her favor by toning down the guitars, eliminating the excessive growling and using more choir parts.<br /><br />All in all, I tried to love this album. I still listen to it daily and try to find redeemable qualities. I hate to slam this, it even hurts to, but I also feel that it would be dishonest to claim this as one of their best releases because it is obvious it isn't. Maybe the standards were too high with Design Your Universe or they were just too tired, I really don't know, but I don't think this will be my favorite. It's a strange feeling as they have never really disappointed me with their songs until this release. I must even add, I hardly remember any of the songs except for \\"Storm the Sorrow\\".<br /><br />There are a few good moments on this CD that you can easily hear on the tracks titled \\"Delirium\\", \\"Storm the Sorrow\\", \\"Deep Water Horizon\\" and \\"Avalanche\\". The rest of the songs I will hopefully, either learn to love or hope that their next release is more memorable. I will of course keep listening to this and maybe it will all grow on me with a few more listens, although after listening to Xandria's newest release, I'm rather doubtful. As for anyone reading this, I still recommend buying this as a fan of Epica because you should make the decision for yourself whether or not this is your cup of tea. UPDATE: It is slowly starting to grow on me, so it is worth listening to a few times.<br />---------------<br />Edit: As someone requested, I am going to list all of the tracks and how much growling by Mark it has. I think this will help people get a good idea of what to expect.<br /><br />1. Karma (Instrumentalwith choir)<br />2. Monopoly on Truth (A lot of growling distastefully done, occasionally Simone joins in- mostly during the end, song is better after 5 minute mark)<br />3. Storm the Sorrow (Very little growling, only during the middle like in \\"Chasing the Dragon\\")<br />4. Delirium (Nice solo at 4:30 mark, this one is a considerably slow song, no growling)<br />5. Internal Warfare (Growling at the 3:17 mark, but mostly Simone sings this, which is a good thing+ strange guitar solo at the 4:00 mark)<br />6. Requiem for the Indifferent (There is growling in this which is tolerable at the beginning and at the 4:04 part it gets worse and I question why it was in there because the song wouldn't be bad, there is also excessive growling at 7:02 which ruined the really pretty slow part sung by Simone)<br />7. Anima (piano instrumental)<br />8. Guilty Demeanor (Growling is present, but done pretty tastefully and Simone is the main focus here)<br />9. Deep Water Horizon (This is a slower song sung by Simone with a choir, but there is growling after the 4:00- seems to be something about the number 4 for Mark and there is growling at 5 minute mark too- this song does have good symphonic elements however, so I forgive the growling)<br />10. Stay the Course (The song starts with growling and occasional singing by Simone, but continues with mostly Mark's growls)<br />11. Deter the Tyrant (Growling at around 3:33, 4:35 and a sound clip inserted in two places, the rest is Simone with the choir)<br />12. Avalanche (Growling at 2:25, 3:19, 4:46, 5:46--pretty much killed the song)<br />13. Serenade of Self-Destruction (mostly instrumental and some singing by the choir-- if that's what you hear, it's an error in CD production. There is singing by Mark and Simone so about 50/50 with the growling and vocals)with choir)<br />2. Monopoly on Truth (A lot of growling distastefully done, occasionally Simone joins in- mostly during the end, song is better after 5 minute mark)<br />3. Storm the Sorrow (Very little growling, only during the middle like in \\"Chasing the Dragon\\")<br />4. Delirium (Nice solo at 4:30 mark, this one is a considerably slow song, no growling)<br />5.

The writing style is fantastic, it's descriptive but doesn't bore you to death with trivialities not relevant to the story. It moves as a great pace and the first book is the perfect character set-up for the second and third books which IMO are even more awesome than the first one.

I cried, I lived adventures, saw amazing places..got drunk in taverns, and had the pleasure of hanging out with one of the most interesting characters I have read in AGES. What other books made me high? Tolkien's books in general, Orson Scott Card (except for his endings, that is), JK Rowling (read them WAY before the movie Hype)... You will not regret this book. It is one of the most amazingly well written pieces of art I have encountered. Go for it.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|This sure could have been worse... I enjoyed the film as pure entertainment. The actors are just ok, the plot is just ok, but the concept is down well and there are a few parts that are really neat. The special effect are onviously lacking as this is not a film with a blockbuster budget; however, it is done better than a lot of dragon based fantasy films i have seen. I like the troll idea, there are many possiblities here. Hopefully someone else will bite and we can get a few like this. Well done.

B004DK5CYM|5.0|If you were alive and paying attention to the Triple Crown in 1973, you've never forgotten those races, especially the Belmont Stakes, where we saw a horse run away from his contemporaries like no horse has ever done in a major race. The call as Secretariat entered the final turn \\"Secretariat is moving like a tremendous machine\\" will live through the ages, and was phenomenally accurate to boot.<br /><br />I'm not as familiar with the behind the scenes story of the horse, the owners, the stable, or the trainer as some might be. Therefore I can't testify to the accuracy or lack thereof of that part of the story. I wouldn't expect it to be overwhelmingly accurate. If it were then this would be the first movie to strictly adhere to the facts. LOL And you have to give the film makers some leeway. They're making a movie about a series of races for which the results are widely known. Yet they have to find a way to inject some drama and suspense into the story. Otherwise you might just as well catch a rerun of ESPN's Sports Century show about the 1973 Triple Crown and Secretariat. LOL<br /><br />While the movie makes an interesting possible fiction about the behind the scenes spunk of those responsible for Secretariat, the meat of the film is the coverage of the Triple Crown, and there the movie shines.<br /><br />In the Kentucky Derby coverage, a bit much is made of Secretariat trailing the field. Watching a replay of the race, it appears that Secretariat was only third from the trailing horse. The rest of the race is presented quite accurately, using the transcript of the actual race call, if not word for word then pretty close to it.<br /><br />For the Preakness, a bit of drama was introduced. Here Secretariat indeed trailed the field at the beginning of the first turn, but turned it on quickly to move to the front on the backstretch. The movie pads the length of time before Secretariat moved up and took the lead for dramatic effect, but again essentially the original racing call is used. Interestingly, this race is presented with the owner's family watching on TV, and I assume uses the actual taped TV footage.<br /><br />There was little drama whatsoever in the Belmont Stakes, and the movie faithfully portrays this race with one exception. In the movie they have Sham even with Secretariat at 1:09 into the race. Actually, at that point the Triple Crown winner had already accelerated for a three to four length lead and was continually pulling away from the rest of the field, eventually winning by an unheard of 31 lengths, and setting a track record which stands to this day. The movie succeeds in that the emotion of that event was recaptured in the film. At Belmont on June 9th 1973, people wept in the stands as Secretariat destroyed the field and won going away. It is quite emotional in the film too. I felt myself a bit choked up, to the point where my voice cracked as I made a comment about the film to my wife at that point.<br /><br />It's not the film makers we judge or think to celebrate here. It is our memories of a great athlete, even if that athlete was a horse. Millions had great affection for Secretariat, and the film recaptures that feeling for all of us who lived it. The back story glues the film together. The Triple Crown races make the film outstanding.cing call is used.

It is our memories of a great athlete, even if that athlete was a horse. Millions had great affection for Secretariat, and the film recaptures that feeling for all of us who lived it. The back story glues the film together. The Triple Crown races make the film outstanding.

B0015DYIH2|4.0|Peeked my interest in classic novels to the point of actually reading several. Wuthering Heights, A Tale of Two Cities, and Great Expectations so far. Heathcliff, Catherine, Bella and Edward.....love is very potent isn't it? Both to the grave and beyond, so too speak.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Smashing adaptation of Michael Lewis' 2003 book on the Oakland A's management saga, with Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill delivering career-high performances. Propelled by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin's razor-sharp screenplay, director Bennett Miller works with a solid bench ranging from cinematography to supporting cast. An immediate classic, \\"Moneyball\\" was among the few 2011 Best Picture contenders that deserved the honor. Essential viewing . . . even if you're not a sports fan.

B004SYP5WC|2.0|UPDATE:<br />Unfortunately, this app stopped working when I upgraded to the Galaxy S7 Edge phone. It hasn't been updated in a long time, but I hope the developer updates it so it works on the newest phones. It was a great, simple app for tracking your bills.<br />--<br />--<br />Original Review:<br /><br />I like this app so far because it appears to be very simple and efficient at reminding you to pay your bills. I track all my due dates on my calendar, with reminders, but the drawback there is that I don't always know if I have paid a bill already or not, so when the due date comes around, I inevitably end up having to go back, log in, and check to see if the bill was paid.<br /><br />This app will change that. I like that you only have to set the bill due date once, and it is automatically added every month (when you set it up as recurring). The key feature for me is the ability to go into the app and mark a bill as &#34;paid&#34; and note the day on which it was paid. This is very helpful, as it allows me to simply check the app on my phone to see if I paid the bill, instead of having to log in to my account through a computer. There are also settings that allow you to customize how far in advance a recurring bill is tracked, and how many days before the due date you want a reminder on your phone's notifications.<br /><br />While this app may not have all of the additional features that other money management programs have, I love that it is simple, does what it is intended to do, and doesn't require any of my personal financial info (as far as accounts and log in info).
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Max Brooks \\"World War Z\\" doesn't read like your typical zombie story. Instead of a linear novel the reader is presented with a series of chapters each detailing a portion of the Zombie War.<br /><br />The novel introduces us to a faceless UN Commissioner who has gone on an extensive fact finding mission about the plague and resulting war for the UN. Fearing that the individual stories may get lost, our narrator decides to write out the memories of those involved.<br /><br />What I liked best about this gimmick is that the novel doesn't slow down. The \\"interview\\" style keeps things moving at a brisk pace. If you find yourself stuck in a story you don't care for, give it a couple pages at most and your onto the next topic or story.<br /><br />Unfortunately this style doesn't allow Brooks a lot of time to build characters. We are introduced to a bunch of individual voices and personalities, but only a couple which could be called true characters.<br /><br />If you aren't sick of the zombie genre yet, then I recommend you give this a try. I was expecting the novel to take a more tongue-in-cheek approach, but was pleasantly surprised that \\"WWZ\\" presents its material in a straight forward fashion.
1466401885|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this book. The relationship in this book is so messed up that it was amazing (let's not forget it's fictional folks). I literally could not put it down. I usually take breaks when reading or at least take my time with my books. I loved this book. I will be rereading it over and over again. Travis and Abby have a very love/ hate relationship that mirrors many real life relationships. Are they healthy? No. But in the end we all know someone or ourselves have been in such a situation at one time or another. Do these realtionships always have such a fairytale outcome. Again No. But that's the beauty of this book. It works for the characters. If you are looking at this book and reading the mixed reviews you probably are going to buy it. You might love it or you might hate it. And it might just be worth the risk. This is one of the very few Contemp Romance novels that I like. I love this one. Jamie McGuire is a talented lady.<br />Pros:<br />It's a gripping read. Fast paced. Hold on to your seat ride. You never know if Travis and Abby will be together or break up. The ups and downs are exciting.<br />Jamie did a great job of writing this book. Unfortunetly girls do find guys like Travis attractive in real life. It's a good look into the mentalities and denial that goes into loving someone like him.<br />It really is beautiful and also a complete disaster. Who doesn't want to fall madly in love with someone that passionate. Reality is it's not that great though. Who hasn't made the mistake of falling in love with someone so wrong for them. We all have been young and naive at some point in our lives.<br />Travis and Abby are not perfect. Nor is their relationship. I sure don't want to read about perfect relationships. They are boring. I want to be entertained by my books. If I wanted to be educated I would have purchased a textbook.<br />Cons:<br />The nickname Pidge. Can't stand it.<br />Travis is violent.<br />I feel like this book was a fair reading on codependent relationships until the end. It works for Travis and Abby because they are fictional characters.r reading on codependent relationships until the end. It works for Travis and Abby because they are fictional characters.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|Walter Isaacson was already a proven biographer before he set about writing this work. There is no doubt that he has done another exemplary job of pulling together  a multitude of facts and, most importantly in this case, the details of how Steve Jobs sought a level of perfection in his products and attained most of what he was aiming for.<br /><br />For the above, Isaacson should be highly commended. But there was one aspect of this work that kept rubbing me the wrong way. To a large degree it was an attitude. Basically, Isaacson is a press man (Time magazine, CNN) and as such probably finds it hard to pen anything without making some sort of controversy about it. The best thing he found to pick apart was Steve Jobs' erratic and steamy personality. There is no doubt that Jobs' personality was less than always charming but Isaacson seems to have spared no opportunity to point it out until the reader may wonder why he's stamping on that edge of Jobs' grave again!<br /><br />I'm not saying it shouldn't be read. All the information is there. It's actually excellent. Just be prepared to get thoroughly briefed again, and again, and again, on the bad side of Job's personality. The author didn't want you to walk away thinking Jobs had a good side only.<br /><br />Gary Judge, author of [[ASIN:1466492198 Understanding the Japanese: Insight into Japanese Culture and Thinking]]
1466401885|5.0|I read this a while back when it first came out but I'm not really good with words so i rarely review.  After all the commotion this week concerning this book I wanted to give my honest opinion and let Jamie know that her loyal readers have her back. I can honestly say that this is my favorite book so far. It's a good story with really great characters who even though have flaws they know that their love is bigger than that. Thanks Jamie for being an awesome author :)
B004N66XYE|5.0|This was much like Downton Abbey without all the steamy sexual scenes and no witchcraft.  Very enjoyable.  Liked following the storyline of the characters.  Funny and sad at times.  Dealt very good with the issue of prejudices.  Very enjoyable story to watch with the family.
0756686970|4.0|Let me say first...we LOVE this book!  So much so that it's already fallen apart, after only having it 2 1/2 months!  My boys look at it on a daily basis.<br /><br />But that being said, this book has the SAME problem as the Lego Star Wars Encyclopedia - the front cover.  Because it has to leave space for the free minifigure, the front cover is very thick and heavy, causing it to pull away from the rest of the book.  With the original encyclopedia, we purchased the \\"library edition\\" after the first one tore apart.  While it was more expensive, it has held together much better.<br /><br />Maybe there is some alternate way to gift a minifigure without compromising the integrity of the book?<br /><br />The book itself is WONDERFUL - just need some help in the \\"keeping it together\\"!
B005Q1W10A|4.0|Like Season 1 we enjoyed this season.  Soap Opera \\"ish\\", but enjoyable.  Not as many steamy sexual scenes as in Season 1, which was a welcome change.  One thing we hated about Season 1 was the homosexual scenes!!!  Did not want to see that at all.  We fast forwarded through those and a couple other sexual scenes in Season 1.  The thing we hated the most in Season 2 was the Ouji Board scenes.  Don't know why that was added.  We don't like anything that has to do with witchcraft.  We did like follow the story line of what was happening in the characters lives.  Just wish the homosexual and witchcraft scenes did not have to be added into the series.  They did not add anything special.  If anything, in our eyes, only detracted from the story.  Unfortunately these days, it is hard to find a good movie or series that doesn't add some sort of sexual (homosexual) or witchcraft element to the story.  What a disappointment when you are trying to find something good to watch.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I downloaded this book for the kindle and it literally changed my life! It is hard to have faith in today's world and especially with everything that is going on in society and this book was a breathe of fresh air. What a great story!
B00020HCH2|4.0|These are energetic performances that go from the exciting to the near miss.<br /><br />The Second is the strongest in the set. Love the strings. The voicings in the brass are great. Clear as a bell. I felt the finale was a hair<br />too fast.<br /><br />The Third is also good, though the Finale is a mad scramble. I don't think such a recording would get issued these days. A retake would be in order.<br /><br />The First? Well, I didn't think much of the first movement, and that didn't bode well for the set as a whole as that's where I started my listening. But it's another good performance that gathers steam as it goes, even with the contrabassoon sounding like a pitch-less fart in the Finale.<br /><br />Least successful is the 4th, which was the earliest recording (1951) and which suffers from changing perspectives and a too-distant sound.<br /><br />It's interesting to hear recordings like this. If anything, they reveal that music making back in the day was a great deal messier than it is today. Truth be told, the technical aspects of the 1951-53 NYPO aren't the equal of many second-tier orchestras that are around today. Today's second-tier orchestras play with a greater sense of nuance than one hears on these discs. They phrase more musically, play with a more-consistent sound quality and have an inner clock that keeps tempos generally tighter. But the \\"old\\" NYPO plays with a great deal of energy and enthusiasm. You get the feeling that they feel they're playing \\"their\\" music for themselves, not playing the music of a great composer for an audience that needs to be educated. They're in the middle of it, not at an arm's distance.<br /><br />This way of playing is a bit more straight forward in some respects than is the norm today. No one is trying to \\"help\\" the music relate to an audience by milking/wringing every last drop of emotion from the piece. It's played with the knowledge that the audience is going to get to hear this music again in the not-too-distant-future, and because of that, we don't need to load up this particular performance with the musical equivalent of the kitchen sink (which tends to happen these days because today's audience may not come back any time soon, what, with all of the other media distractions in their life).<br /><br />It's a bit like the comfortable sweater, or the hymn that gets sung every other Sunday. It feels right without necessarily feeling monumental. We're not being treated to high art, we're being treated to music that's very much alive.<br /><br />I have never warmed to the Walter way of music making, but I can say that with this NYPO Brahms cycle, I've found a Walter recording that I very much enjoy.<br /><br />BTW - I listened to this set through headphones as I find that makes it easier for me to tune out the hiss and other distortions that are part<br />and parcel to vintage recordings. Sounded damn fine.uture, and because of that, we don't need to load up this particular performance with the musical equivalent of the kitchen sink (which tends to happen these days because today's audience may not come back any time soon, what, with all of the other media distractions in their life).<br /><br />It's a bit like the comfortable sweater, or the hymn that gets sung every other Sunday.

B005V20JKI|2.0|very solid controls and a great feeling of character movement. this game falls short on its tuning. killing enemies doesn't feel rewarding as they are worth so little exp compared to the muffins. it is also extremely grindy to lvl up the characters. you want a 20+hour experience to complete a mobile game?

I also love the huge variety of fringing options she gives.<br /><br />Since I'm a visual learner, I appreciate all the photos that are included to demonstrate every technique presented.

From the vantage point of a stranger to English I would think it an excruciatingly difficult language to learn. We native speakers have enough trouble as it is.
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|My boys love the video! It arrived quickly and was just as described. The video was a sequel of the first Transformers movie, so it was good to see at least several familiar characters.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I grabbed this game for my Kindle Fire within the first couple of days of purchase and have played it a LOT! The game is solid and the controls are idiot-proof; I have had a lot of fun with this app and can recommend it without hesitation.<br />The only downside I have found is there is an ad for other card games after each deal...the ad is only an image, however, and can be exited out of straight away. The game is free, though, so it isn't really an issue for me.<br />If you enjoy card games in general, or Solitaire in particular...it's an easy choice.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|My daughter stumbled on this book at her yaReads Goodreads.com 'page, group' of cool recommendations and chatty book loving online friends. Of course it was the awesome cover that caught her eye, then mine. The title is also perfect, and the author kind and generous as well. Not many writers will give some of their proceeds to charity. Go #autisum ! This is the second time we have purchased this book--to support the author, her cause and to PASS IT ON, and for the price it's a STEAL. The heroine, Sophia Parsons is battling her own personal war...in her life, in her mind, against practicing her religion, and against horrible, real people in her town. As for Charles...Rebecca Hamilton knows how to write a great, sexy hero. It's such a twist how the stakes in this book keep rising. Sophia has to solve the mystery of her anscestor's hanging, but the creatures...supernatural beings in her town would prefer to seeher DEAD first. This book has everything, grim reapers, shapeshifters and more... anyhow just READ IT. She's a beautiful writer that will sweep you away and when it's over you'll want more.  We do.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I would not even give it one star!  Got no further than the first romp and deleted it from my Kindle.  What an arrogant nasty man and she is made out to be sooo sweet that you soon realise what trash you are reading.  Very disappointing, as I thought I would try something very new and modern.<br />I tend to look mostly at the positive reviews, and there were a few, but this has taught me to read the negative ones too and take note of their reasons for being negative!!  I consider it a waste of money.  To my mind Kindle offerings of new books have gone downhill with too much romantic trash instead of books you can get your teeth into and your brain entertained.
B006SV2LWA|1.0|runs like one of those made for TV disaster flicks - poor acting - poor story line.  I can't believe Matt Damon would even let them put his name on it.  If they would let me give it a zero - I would.  SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY - DON'T DO IT

B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you have not yet seen the HBO series on television, hold out for a little bit longer and read the books first.  George R R Martin is without a doubt a grand master of his craft.  I have never been a huge fan of the fantasy genre, nor have I been particularly interested in reading epic tales that take up half of my bookshelf.  However, these books are in a league of their own.  They are absolute gems in terms of literary entertainment.  From the first book, `Game of Thrones' right through to `A Dance with Dragons', GRRM has proven his ability and skill to keep the reader, obsessively and compulsively turning each page, wanting more.  I love how these books are written from different viewpoints.  It certainly makes for an interesting and unique journey.  These books dramatically reveal how things are not always as they seem and that the concepts of good and bad are not as clearly defined as one would expect.  You come to love some characters, and loathe others, but you still want to know what happens to each and every one of them.  Each character is complex, so your initial assessment of them is bound to change.  This has nothing to do with you having a fickle nature but rather exemplifying GRRM as a superb storyteller.  What I've found reading these books is that there are no `minor' characters at all.  Some characters that you may think are important are relegated to a lesser role or worse, while supposedly smaller characters are elevated to positions that are significant for the story to progress.  You become very attached to these characters and deeply enmeshed in their daily lives. If it wasn't a work of fiction, this type of behaviour would most certainly be deemed unhealthy.  There are so many storylines to this tale that would keep the most cynical of readers comfortably occupied but truly satisfied whether they care to admit it or not.  Yes, there were moments where I was left silently screaming at the fate of some characters, wondering at their sudden demise, but herein lies the excitement and the build up to what I am certain will be an explosive finale (hopefully several more books away).  There is treachery and corruption at every turn.  There is also blind ambition, and unfailing loyalty and honour.  Many battles are fought, and the `good guys' are not always victorious, which reflects real life I suppose. The question left begging is who will win the war and ultimately this Game of Thrones?<br />I cannot wait for the next book.  Well, actually I can.  When GRRM is ready to produce the next instalment in this series, I know that I will not be disappointed.<br />
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I had put off watching the final season of GG because of what I've heard from others - mainly negative reviews on the romantic relationships of the show and how some characters changed, which I didn't find anything the deviates from their original characters.  I see the women of Stars Hollow evolving including Lane and Mrs. Kim.  In the final season, Rory has two more friends who are girls, which is refreshing to see.  You also see the growth of all of the mains characters, which is an important factor for me in films.<br /><br />I watched all the seasons in consecutive order and there were so many tearful and sentimental moments in the final season.  Finally, there is closure.<br /><br />Sidenote: It never ceases to amaze me at how much specific dialogue these actors have to remember and put on a natural and convincing act.  Truly a unique show with great performances.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|If any one has not own this BLU RAY then you need to buy it.  It is a hilarious movie. As for picture and sound, it is excellent.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|How much longer do we have to wait?!?! My daughter hooked me on these books, (Kindle-style) and I finished this, called her for the title to the next book, and she said it isn't finished yet! Oh well, I've done the same to her. Excellent combination of medievalism, with a touch of sci-fi. Didn't think I'd like the series at first, especially when expected long-term protagonists get the chop, but somehow that's so much more real than any - no, every - other series I've read. Keeps me guessing who'll survive!.....
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Sandra Bullock leads an incredible cast that makes this story (based on a true story) so believable, and so inspiring. It portrays the human spirit in it's simplest form; helping others.<br /><br />There is nothing else I can say, except that it changed my life in a subtle way by making me take stock in what I have. When I think I'm having a bad day, I can rest assured that millions of people have it much worse than; kinda puts the issue into perspective.
B005342N58|5.0|At first, you'll be tempted to think that the Arctic Monkeys have veered off from their usual kind of music and you may not like it.  I didn't at first.  After listening to the songs on the album each a couple of times, you start to hear the Arctic Monkeys' sound in their new music and I really like it.  Some of my favorites are: \\"Brick by Brick,\\" and \\"Suck it and See.\\"  The songs differ from their usual sort but after a while, you'll begin to like the difference and enjoy the new music.  I think people that truly fans of this band will be pleasantly surprised, but you need to give the music time!
B007JF87VS|4.0|\\"Better Angels\\" is episode 12 in the second season of \\"The Walking Dead\\".<br /><br />Some thoughts...<br /><br />1.) a seemingly 'slow' episode ends with an absolute blockbuster of an ending.<br /><br />2.) one gets the feeling that the normal way of being infected with the Zombie 'virus' as just undergone a new and sinister mutation.<br /><br />3.) my only concern for this show/series is that there seems to be a definitive 'soap opera' quality creeping into the events that involve our survivors. Things seem to be becoming a little more bizarre every week. This may not be necessarily a good sign.<br /><br />4.) great actors and great acting giving us memorable characters.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Overall a rather slow episode (2 1/2 to 3 Stars), but with a stunning finale (5+ Stars)<br /><br />Aggregate rating 4 1/2 Stars.<br /><br />Ray Nicholson
B004P4S4NM|5.0|This album has something for everyone: romance, heartbreak, soul, piano solos, etc.  This is an amazing CD that has won so many awards, and deservingly so.  Buy it; you won't regret it!  The music will speak to you and each individual song is amazing.  21 is the BOMB!
B0040GYAOM|4.0|Despite the claim of 30 #1 hits, a check of singles peak chart positions indicates that not all 30 of these recordings are #1 hits.

Hard Headed Woman off of the King Creole LP in 1958 topped at #2 across all charts.  A better song from that LP is the title track. Amazon currently has this MP3 album on special so it is a good buy for the money but there are some tracks you might listen to a lot more than others. If you already own The Number One Hits CD you probably will pass on this one.  The re-recording of Are You Lonesome Tonight sounds great. I believe it was recorded in the RCA Studio B in Nashville, TN.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|This CD has a definite religious feel and an unusually more moderate album.  The songs are amazing though and every one unique.  I like almost every song and this is definitely a worthy purchase!  If you even like Florence a tiny bit, then you will really enjoy this CD.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|...not as good as the original and Seasons, but I like it.  There are a couple of bird additions I'm not too fond of, but who cares...there are monkeys.
0525478817|5.0|Ever since Will Grayson Will Grayson, I have been on a huge John Green kick.  Not only is he a humorous writer with a knack for creating great characters, but he is also a brilliant vlogger.  (Check him out on YouTube.)  Anyway, The Fault in Our Stars sounded like it was going to be a real tear-jerker...and there are some sad parts, but these characters do not want your pity.  This is no after school special and these kids are not perfect.  They don't want to be inducted into Sainthood on their death just because they had cancer.  This made them feel real and sympathetic in a way that characters in the Lifetime Movies never quite achieve.<br /><br />The relationship between Hazel and Augustus is so much more than their illness.  There is a deep understanding between them that their non-cancer peers can never fully feel.  The few strained conversations Hazel has with her best-friend-who-really-isn't-anymore illustrate this so realistically. I imagine this is exactly how it would really be like.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book is how Hazel and Augustus bond over this novel about a teen with cancer which cuts off without an ending.  I know this book, The Imperial Affliction, does not exist, but I would love to read it!  John Green, if you are reading this, think you can write it????  Oh, who am I kidding...John Green is not reading my little bloggy thing.  *sigh*<br /><br />The only thing that bothered me (and I mean slightly) was the characters were like these brilliant philosophical genius kids with vocabularies bigger than Thesauruses.  I'm not saying that smart teenagers are unrealistic, but the constant intellectual banter became a bit much in a few places.  Not enough to distract me from the story, but enough that I noticed a few times.<br /><br />Overall, I give The Fault in Our Stars...<br /><br />Plot - 5 bookmarks<br />Character Development - 5 bookmarks<br />Love Story - 5 bookmarks<br />Dialog - 4 3/4 bookmarks (I only deduct a quarter of a point for the banter.)<br />Dream Cast (otherwise known as who I pictured while reading) - Lily Collins (Hazel), Ed Speleers (Augustus), Rory Culkin (Isaac)point for the banter.)<br />Dream Cast (otherwise known as who I pictured while reading) - Lily Collins (Hazel), Ed Speleers (Augustus), Rory Culkin (Isaac)

B006PHD0RW|4.0|To me this is a great \\"action\\" alternative to tetris its deceptively easy, until you need to do things like bag 400 groceries.  The only thing I didn't care for is the directions go by too quickly, or offer them in options during the game. Overall I love it, its one of my favs.

B003RV43X4|5.0|This was an amazing movie! Great graphics and realistic sounds made 'Clash of the Titans' a well-worth-watching movie. The plot was great and, though delving more into the story of the war between man and the Greek Gods, along with a slightly longer, more tragic and trauma-laden, things may have made it better if they had done so while creating this film, it is still one of my favorites :) Thank-yous and hugs to to the entire crew, especially the technician and graphic guys. I also loved the costumes! Man, where can I get that dress?! :) Hope you enjoy it, because I sure did.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|...but my wife and I play with it just as much!  We like to draw a background, and then use stickers to add to it.  The share button is great, as we can email my son's drawings to Great Gramma.  VERY happy with this app, and it's well worth the price.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Enjoyed the book, however all the background information could it a difficult read for those who don't jump from past to present to past to present with ease.  Is rather dark in context, but in general it is a good read.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love the addition of the dragon that flies in and destroys almost everything.  Cherry Blosson is a difficult addition.  By the way, if you get stuck, it helps to work with a child with Aspergers.  They'll help ya.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl is an amazing debut novel by Rebecca Hamilton - it left me wanting more, and I can't wait to read the rest of the series! The characters were all fantastic and I instantly had a connection with the main character, a young woman named Sophia who is trying to find her place in a world of the supernatural that she gets thrown into. The supernatural universe and the history is so complex and real and I loved Ms. Hamilton's unique take on the subject of vampires that is so common at the moment. The amount of research that the author has put into this book to write a believeable, entertaining and thrilling story is immediately apparent - and the story grabs you right from the first page. I haven't read a book so quickly in a long time - I just didn't want to put it down! If you're a fan of paranormal fantasy/romance, you'll DEFINITELY want to pick up The Forever Girl: Sophia's Journey book one - I promise you won't be disappointed (well, except for when you reach the end and wish there was more of the story to read!).
B0058VW36U|4.0|To be honest, I got way too frustrated with the game, myself, and do not play often, but I work with kids (who are in difficult situations), and I use it often with them.  It's a great entertainer, and keeps their mind off of things.  Cute, great graphics, gameplay, and sounds.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because of all the options and it is so fun.the game will also give you bonus points for installing new apps.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I love me some Amazon, but filters are really needed to narrow down searches.  Prime only, customer reviews, price low-high are my three main filters.

B007JF87VS|3.0|MAJOR SPOILERS A-PLENTY!!!!! so beware..<br /><br />The writing on this show goes from interesting, deadly, to mediocre, soapy, interesting, and dumb-ass all within an entire episode. The first season did have me by the throat and would not let go; Fast, even pacing, great characters in a really messed-up universe, which has apparently gone from severely depressing to near-futile. There could be so many things to talk about, but there is laundry to do so...<br /><br />Just a few things then..<br /><br /> * Zombie effects/moments some of the best I have ever seen. The FX people are kicking-ass!<br /><br /> * Glenn's character has been relegated to being more vulnerable (meek comes to mind, so does moronic- if they were going for laughs by sending him down that well..) in contrast to the 1st season, where the kid had some life and more smarts. My respect for his character has plummeted somewhat.<br /><br /> * Carl. Man, he totally gets on my nerves. Wandering around free as a bird with that irritating giant hat on, crying one moment then doing something stupid the next.  I can understand the idea of his character growing up and reacting in that survival context, a young boy trying to prove himself, but... like other reviewers have mentioned, who keeps a leash on this kid in that kind of environment? Kids get up to shenanigans, but c'mon, this is ridiculous, which in turn makes Lori look like the Worst TV Mom. What is he, maybe eight or nine years old, and adults are handing him a large loaded gun. I might have forgotten the moment when he was trained, maybe?  The show becomes STAGY around Carl (and not just with him..), like he is a catalyst for events- the biggest one occurring this episode where he comes out of nowhere ( giant hat on, of course) almost obligatory with his new loaded gun. Geez..<br /><br /> * I do feel sorry for some of the actors we never see anymore. Irone Singleton, you have my sympathy, pal.<br /><br /> * Jeffrey DeMunn- you did a great job and brought some humanity to the table as Dale. You came off as real and one of the best.<br /><br /> So long Shane- you were an interesting, angry, alpha-male character and had an overload of good screen-time moments- Hats off to Joe Bernthal for strong acting and good luck on his next show LA Noir, which involves Frank Darabont I believe.

1612130607|1.0|The Fifty Shades Series is a rip off a fanfiction that for MANY months was free.<br /><br />The ONLY reason to read this last book is that before the fanfiction series was finished this author pulled it from the web so as to \\"legitimize\\" the series when she published? I'm not entirely sure this is just a guess.<br /><br />This story was originally written as a Twilight Fanfiction with \\"Bella\\" and \\"Edward\\" taking the place of the main characters. Under the AU - Alternate Universe Category. The story was called Master of the Universe originally. Fifty shades of Grey came from \\"Bella\\" referring to \\"Edward\\" in her head and her thoughts about his character as she got to know him.<br /><br />More than 50% of this story was already released to the web-world for FREE! As fanfiction inspired by Stephanie Meyer's characters. Then some publishing company came knocking on her door and said pull it, pull it quick and change the names, into some god awful cheap porno-soundingish names and we'll publish this bad boy as an original work.<br /><br />I'll admit to enjoying the fanfiction version [the bit of it I read, I did miss the last bit because it was pulled before I could catch it lol] but to pay for this after having read most of it for free boggles my mind. The only reason to purchase this third book is to find out what the heck happened in the end even though the names are no longer Bella and Edward lol.<br /><br />Ultimately, save your money folks, don't fall into the hype on this one. If you hit the fanfiction forums enough, I promise you someone has what was published saved in PDF and you'll get most of the story that way for free lol.

B000HC2LI0|3.0|As to the content. West Wing is amazing television. Esp the first four seasons. There is a marked drop-off when Sorkin leaves. The Alda/Smitts plots in 6 and 7 are pretty compelling though. I missed Rob Lowe and wanted more of my Josh/Toby,wasn't thrilled to see them fade so much. As to the DVD's, the extras kind of blow. They were not very imaginative. It's all self-aggrandizing, no one says ANYTHING surprising, and for an entire season, the amount of extra content is very low, and aside from some commentaries on episodes (and there are few) almost none of it's illuminating. Would have LOVED to hear commentaries with some of the actors. The director/producer guys are embarrassingly dull and dry -even Sorkin was blah. Still, the first four seasons of this are some of the best TV I've seen.<br /><br />The seller: Quick shipping, great price for the set. One disc in season 4 was blank and would not operate. Still a good value. A single season of this goes for 20 plus and the whole series was under 90!

B005DR64OQ|2.0|I was surprised by how bad this movie actually was...but I feel compelled to warn others..it is pretty slow and boring. The negative reviews on here are spot on. Cage plays a wimpy businessman who refuses to open a safe, and Kidman is a meek and 'sexy' wife that a crook has a crush on. Okay...the thieves are pretty clueless and their plan unravels...the action is more psychological than literal. I would rent this or watch it on TV if nothing else was on. Seriously. It is pretty average and boring. Do not waste money on a purchase.
B005UG542S|4.0|This movie does not fall short of the others.  It hits all the major parts from the book and does not disappoint.  The movie has great special effects.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I have bought almost all 3D's released so far since they can't be rented. I have wasted some serious cash and suffered through some real duds. I am not a techno viewer... I just want to let you know that this is one fun movie. The 3D makes you jump, scream, and laugh. This is the best use of 3D yet. It doesn't just add depth, it has a lot of eye popping fun.

However, some of the animal noises are a bit difficult for me as a parent to mimic - I have no clue how to \\"bray\\" like a zebra. But then again, I just wing it - and she loves it just the same. :)

B006ZZAMWK|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 11/28/11**<br /><br />Though they've got a lot of competition in the UK, One Direction have released the best boyband album of the year by a mile. Not only that, but it's one of the best pop albums of 2011 as well. It's that rare case of a record where every track could be a single. Couple that with the guys' insane popularity and I think we've got a new Take That on our hands. Or at the very least, a new Mcfly.<br /><br />1. What Makes You Beautiful - Their big, breakthrough single. This is the type of unabashed power pop that manages to cross audiences and appeal to everyone. It's everything these guys should be doing, and one of the year's best singles. 10/10<br /><br />2. Gotta Be You - This, on the other hand, should never have been a single. It's a nice song and a great album track, but there are stronger ballads on here. It does have a very Christmassy sound, though. 9/10<br /><br />3. One Thing - Basically What Makes You Beautiful Part II, which explains why it's the next single. Same writers, similar production, and nearly as catchy. This could end up being the band's defining sound. 10/10<br /><br />4. More Than This - Probably the best ballad on here. It's got a mature, classic sound to it and a wonderful melody with the expected boyband lyrics. Niall sounds especially excellent here. If this isn't a future single, it's a real shame. 10/10<br /><br />5. Up All Night - An uptempo, catchy track with more of a rock sound. It borders on the novelty side of things, but I really love the Def Leppard-esque refrain at the end of the chorus and all the little hooks that run through the track. As with most tracks on the album, it's a ready-made single. 9/10<br /><br />6. I Wish - Melody is the focus here, as this is one of the more mature sounding tracks on the album. It's got a throwback sound--a little rock, a little country. It doesn't initially stand out, but becomes better each time you hear it. 10/10<br /><br />7. Tell Me A Lie - This is such a ready-made hit. Written for (by?) Kelly Clarkson, it sounds a lot like My Life Would Suck Without You (which, ironically, the boys sang on X-Factor). If they really want to break America, this is the song to release. It's one of their absolute best. 10/10<br /><br />8. Taken - Another ballad, this is a Harry-centric track. It reminds me of something that Hanson would record, and that is no bad thing. It has a very organic feel. 9/10<br /><br />9. I Want - Probably my least favorite track on the album. It was written by Mcfly and has Queen-esque guitars in it, which should be a great thing. But the melody and lyrics just seem too obvious. Not bad by any standards, but not amazing either. 7/10<br /><br />10. Everything About You - Ushering in the dancier part of the album, this is a propulsive, repetitive radio track. Maybe a tad too repetitive, but I guess that's sort of the point. It's instantly catchy, for sure. 8/10<br /><br />11. Same Mistakes - The final ballad, and it's a great one. The melody really appeals to me. It's got an interesting sound that somehow feels a lot more indie than the other tracks on the album. 10/10<br /><br />12. Save You Tonight - The band's RedOne collaboration, and it's totally RedOne by numbers. That being said, the song's grown immensely on me. The chorus is still a bit underwhelming, but I love the bridge and verses. 8/10<br /><br />13. Stole My Heart - What a way to end the album! Over a Dynamite-esque beat, the guys have taken the current trend of electro-dance and perfected it. The chorus and production are ridiculous. This needs to be a single! 10/10<br /><br />Album Grade: 9.2/10
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not some sullen housewife nor do I have a broken home.  I will say that after this book it introduced some ideas to keep that from happening.  This book was addictive from the start, the story was fantastic and since I'm from Seattle it was nice to recognize some of the mentioned landmarks.  Get this book, buy the trilogy and enjoy some really great reading!
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I was disappointed by how short this book was (really, really disappointed as I bought the kindle edition and hadn't bothered to check on word count).  However, it's got so many little gems inside that I ended up loving it anyway and finding myself thinking about while driving the car, etc.
B004132HZS|5.0|I have always been a fan of Arthur Conon Doyles series of Sherlock Holmes and I have watched many versions of the different cases, but I must admit this has to be one of the BEST versions I've seen yet. It captures your attention with the intriguing crimes and the enjoyable banter between Holmes and Watson. I was amazed by how good it was...If you like Sherlock Holmes, and you like the mystery mixed with a little bit of snarky humor then I highly reccomend this series. It gives you another glimpse into who Sherlock Holmes is BEFORE he becomes the greatest man Watson ever knew. Plus there is a season 2 that BBC is currently working on which is a relief to fans out there. Hope this helps.

0887307280|4.0|This is less a review of Michael Gerber's classic E-Myth Revisited book as it is a warning to those of you who are looking into E-myth's current coaching programs. As of October 2011, E-myth moved their headquarters to Ashland, Oregon, let go of many staff who worked in their Santa Rosa office for many years, and replaced them with people who are part of a controversial emotional spiritual healing group led by Daniel Barron. You can read more about his work on his website: theohumanity.org and the negative side at [...]. With so many senior members of E-myth's management team (the CEO, Chairman of the Board, COO, Director of Sales, Director of training, many coaches) also being members and some facilitators of Daniel's work, how can there not be a link between the two paradigms?    Question is: do you really want to receive business coaching from people who are so devoted to serving only a tiny majority of the population in \\"deconstructing their strategic selves?\\" Both Daniel's process (seminars and private sessions) and E-Myth's programs (esp. private coaching) cost money...guess one way for Daniel's followers to be able to pay for their sessions and seminars with him is to be able to work for E-myth, getting a profit from Michael Gerber's lifetime of work and effort. Both of these are very focused and intense paradigms and are in direct conflict of each others' core values and premises....how could someone coaching you that is involved in both NOT mix them into what they offer you? And, why has E-myth become the undercover operations house for Daniel's followers?    It's your choice to read a book and become involved with E-myth, just wanted you to know what pill you were actually taking. Why doesn't E-myth just come clean and with integrity claim the link between the two? Or is Michael Gerber too much of a \\"premier sentinel\\" to support in a public way..although they are only too happy to earn money off of him...
