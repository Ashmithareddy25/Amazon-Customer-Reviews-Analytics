B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Although the main characters are teens, some of the topics in this well written novel are definitely delicate. Hoover created a believable storyline, true to life characters, and moving scenes. I was quickly drawn into the story and didn't want to put down my Kindle.
0553801473|3.0|I love Game of Thrones!! With that being said I couldn't wait to read the 5th book. I did find it a bit on the boring side and harder to follow then the first 4. Will that discourage me from continuing the series? No. I'm just hoping the next book holds my interest better then this one did. Not as much thrills in book 5 as the others and started to loose track of who was who (except the main charcters).
B00BVDNKSY|5.0|This is an incredibly difficult game that I would recommend to anyone looking for a hard game. I think it's worth the $3 price tag and has no glitches as far as I can see. The levels are simple but get harder once the screen begins to pulse and spin faster and faster. I LOVE Super hexagon.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a must see!  My wife and I watch this every so often and every time is just as great as the first.  Highly recommended!!
B00AEFZ8OY|4.0|Too funny I had forgotten how stupid this movie was and yet it was super funny but so dorky as well
B004X80QNG|1.0|Thank God I didn't pay for this. It's not intuitive, attractive or even useful. Being Amazon's free app&nbsp;of&nbsp;the day is just helping to spread the word on how bad this is.<br /><br />If it was 99 cents, fine... But $10?? You guys are insane.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's great and I really like it.it is awesome game, and whoever invented it is a genius. It is eazy to play, and people of all ages can do it.
125000568X|5.0|I grew up in the years of Elvis Presley and never got into &#34;rock&#34; music until my 48 year old son began playing it in our workplace.  He played a video of Queen at Wembley stadium, and I began to be interested.  I purchased several Queen CD's and discovered that I loved their music.  I wanted to know more about them and ordered this book.  It is fascinating to find out how they got together and what happened during their years together.  I highly recommend the book for anyone who wants more information about them.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Anything Nicholas Sparks is great. This book is no exception. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. The plot is gripping.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Feedly is a really handy little app that lets me link all of my favourite blogs, sites and comics into one easy to read digest. It removes them once read, so I always know exactly how much new gubbins there is awaiting me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the sharing links haven't worked for me yet. I've tried to email a couple of comics to my husband, and a couple of blog posts to myself with notes to follow up on stuff, and so far zero have got through. I've now given up trying to share articles, which is a big disappointment in the app.<br /><br />There are also lots of sites that are difficult to add. You have to get the wording exactly right in your search, or your site doesn't appear. It just feels like it shouldn't be that difficult to find a feed based on its URL rather than site title, but I'll admit we're not in my area of expertise.<br /><br />Finally, it would be nice if more content showed up in my Feedly feed directly, rather than appearing as a blank page with just a link to the website. It's better than nothing at all, but it is a fidget to have half the pages link elsewhere. It sort of defeats the aim of the app, which is to have all my feeds in the one place.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|I did not expect me or my kids to enjoy this movie as much as we did! We watch it over and over again. I'm not sure how we missed this when it first came out but we won't miss the rest of them.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|The plan is an excellent one and has several studies to support it. However, the book gets a little tedious at times .As a Lifetime member of WW, I was having trouble dealing with another 30 years of counting points and wishing I only had to do it for a day or two at a time. Along came this book, recommended by a friend, allowing me to do exactly that.The 500 calorie fast is so easily done, especially if you like fruits & vegetables. My weight loss has been slow , 3lb in 4 weeks, but have had a lot of events on regular days, causing my intake to be higher than normal on those days. The best part is that after a day of fasting, I can revel in eating like a normal person for a couple of days. This is something I haven't been able to do in decades.  I recommend trying this plan if you're &#34;burnt out&#34; on dieting!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was hard to read at parts because there were many sad parts and even though the hunger games themselves were over, death was all around. I was a little disappointed how gale just left her but I loved the fact that she killed the more dangerous president at the end. Great book and if you do read it make sure you take your time because every detail counts. Truly a perfect way to end a perfect series.

High quality, good actors.<br /><br />Can't wait for the 4th season as it promises to be epic!
B003BV8I3Q|5.0|I love this movie and I am just overjoyed to have it in my very own collection. I think It's also a great gift to buy for family or friend.
B00CATONCA|4.0|...but kinda bummed.  much smaller than i thought it would be.  in height, it's smaller than the walker head ss2 set.  also, seriously doesn;t come with batteries?!  would have purchased and installed before i gave my husband had i known this. (says this on the bottom of the box...wasn't looking there ahead of time!)
B004JZBGWI|5.0|like the checklist function,  now I keep all my to do lists separated on my phone and even put my grocery list on my phone; I always have it when I stop at the store on the way home from work

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Nice twists to a well written mystery ..<br />I liked the Australian setting and characters. The reader feels the emotions of each of the characters and understands their reasoning and decisions which affect many lives
1444737112|5.0|could not put it down. Stayed up reading till midnight and past.  Very emotional, How wonderful the attachment that James Bowen, an exceptional guy, had for his cat.  And Bob sure is an exceptional cat.  I have 7 of them, all rescues, and I can't see them following me in the street like Bob......Well written, keeps you interested all throughout, awesome twosome.

B00AC8ZJ6K|1.0|Poor story line, poor acting, bad special effects.  The producers are betting you will be drawn to this film by the Halo brand.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hope that car accident wasn't fatal.  He deserves to live after all he went through. Especially with a new baby
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Could not be better. I adore everything about DA and am so glad Amazon has it to stream so I can binge watch for days!
B00DHRLK84|4.0|Before I start let me say that I have read the WWZ book twice and this movie has some parts of it in it, but nothing else.  If I was to compare it with the book the movie would get 1 or 2 stars maybe but this is because the book is really good.  Then again if you read the book it would not make a good movie, because there are too many stories in it.<br /><br />Having said that...  I went to see this movie at the theater back in june and found myself liking the movie.  I had to get past the fact that the zombies in this movie can actually run (Max Brooks in his first book states that zombies cannot run) and they all acted like triathlon athletes and also as a unit.<br /><br />The movie had great scenes, I wanted to see the Battle of Yonkers but sadly it was never filmed (if you read the book you will know what I am talking about).<br /><br />I think this movie screws the pooch with the solution they come up with right before the end.  I mean that zombies = dead and they are controlled by a virus, fungus or bacteria (according to the reference materials, I just forget which one is it).  They do not smell, think or see they just attack (mindless killing machine).
B000VK99Z6|3.0|Typical british humor...a bit dry unless you happen to enjoy their attempts at humor. If you like Monty Python, then you'll find this entertaining.

B007KFZ7RE|3.0|Sound on this CD is absolutely terrible....He sounds better on Darryl's House than on this CD. He may need to listen to his CDs before he tries to sell them. We love his music but bad recording studio.

B003V4AK8E|2.0|I got this controller because i wanted a second controller for my PS3 for my freind,when i got it i didnt use it much,i did have a problem with the X button,i had to press it harder,that was annoying,i wasnt much of a fan of the xbox button configuration,and the grip of the controller felt horrid,the triggers wasnt the best either,i would avoid this prouduct,and go with another cheap controller.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|How can I rate something that's &#34;unavailable&#34;? Very disappointed. When will it be &#34;available&#34;? Hope to see a free download soon??
B00CNBS5XS|5.0|Great build, only took a couple of hours.  One of the best star wars kits made and is very stable even for younger kids.  Easily one of my favs...
B00D8HNR2K|1.0|I'm part of the group that thinks everything after \\"The Fragile\\" is pure garbage and \\"Hesitation Marks\\" does nothing to change that.  I have no idea why people are saying this is another \\"Downward Spiral\\", its not even in the same ball-park.  You can tell he spent a lot of time on Downward Spiral, poured his heart and soul into it.  There was a real visceral grind to it, this album has none of that.  It seems like he is just dabbling in music now, I can imagine him in the bathroom with a little keyboard on his lap dreaming songs like \\"Copy of a\\" and \\"Came back Haunted\\".  If Trent Reznor was coming out with this stuff in the early 90s no one would know his name today - bottom line.  I have a co-worker who has not listened to anything after \\"The Fragile\\" and just came back from a launch break with \\"Hesitation Marks\\".  I didn't say anything to him, just watched him slowly get pissed until he decided to return it.  Poor guy, he just found out NIN lost its balls.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wonderful graphics!!! Diverse, mind challenging puzzles!!!!! A different game than is typical. Definitely a great purchase, well worth the money.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|fun game with many different things to explore. i am enjoying the levels and types of puzzles. would recommend for all ages.
B004HO6I2O|5.0|This is a 5 star comedy that is for adults only' I would say younger kids should not see this movie but who am I to Judge... I rate it E for EVERYONE
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Really liked this one, made me wish I had read this in high school when it was given as an option.
B000UD08HW|5.0|Keeping the music of Pink Floyd alive, thing David Gilmore is a total class act, he is one of the best musicians alive, definetly a must for all Pink Floyd fans.
B00D8HNR5W|5.0|Hesitation Marks is a total dig. Is an album of tremendous digital percussion full of little electronic drumming details all over. The songs are very comfortable to the ear. Subtle touches of industrial synth sounds with the catch of pop caressing the tunes in a bittersweet dark darth experience. I think the album moves you the way Trent planned it to be. And, I think he achieved what he meant to create with the music, the feeling he wanted to deliver, it delivers right through. At least it did for me. Last thought: GREAT. Change your ears and try again.
B00843TZJM|5.0|If you bought the DVD + 2CD copy thinking you purchased a Blu-ray Version you better take a closer look because there is no Blu-ray copy the only way your going to get a true Blu-Ray disc is to purchase the it all by itself.
B007OV6AT8|4.0|P D James does it again.  Always a good read and keeps you interested in all the characters.  I love mysteries and this fit the bill.
B0068FZ0YM|3.0|The only reason I purchased this one is because the acting by Heath Ledger was great, and there will not be any more movies made with  Ledger, what a loss
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all times.  Every one of the series is worth the read several times over.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Man when I saw this in theaters I loved it it was suspenseful thrilling action packed keep you on the edge movie and I would recommend it to everybody who is into action and horror science fiction movies
1401216676|5.0|If you love Batman, or the Joker, or Gotham in general, you gotta get this book. Its a great read. Excellent art work. This one is the deluxe edition and I think its well worth the money. Great price and arrived fast.
0316077046|5.0|i love the book ! ti cant wait for the next movie! And these book were my Birthday gift ! they were on time for Delivery and have opened my eyes to a new side of dark!
140006922X|1.0|One: If Aslan is not a first-century scholar, that loses some credibility for me.<br />Two: Why would his followers embrace a message, to avoid persecution, that has always produced persecution?<br />Three: His \\"theories\\" fail to first look into the evidence. An anti-supernatural bias makes no sense if the facts of a case--such as the empty tomb of Christ and the sudden boldness of the formerly devastated disciples--point to a supernatural explanation.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|This book definitely keeps you guessing about who the villain could be!  I will continue with the Harry Hole series

B008XBCJ34|5.0|You can easily see why this movie set new standards computerized cinematography. Great 3-D effects. Very creative story line too.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|I haven't followed BMTH since the beginning and maybe if I had, my opinion would be different. But, I love Sempiternal. Every song is amazing. From \\"Can You Feel My Heart\\" which I have not been able to get out of my head for days to \\"And The Snakes Start to Sing\\" every song is a brilliant little masterpiece. Impressive vocals and instrumentation from start to finish.<br /><br />favorite tracks:<br />Can You Feel My Heart<br />Sleepwalking<br />And The Snakes Start To Sing<br />The House Of Wolves<br />Empire (Let Them Sing)<br />Go To Hell, For Heaven s Sake<br />Hospital For Souls
B005H9B44A|4.0|Thor is a fun movie to watch. It has very cool special effects and keeps you entertained throughout. I would recommend to any guy looking for just a fun movie to watch with little substance.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I didn't know what I would think of this game, but when I started playing I t I couldn't stop. It is so addicting and I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B0083Z614S|5.0|If this book is not on every young adults reading list, it should be. The story is amazing, going from India to<br />England. It makes you root for a happy ending.
1401207529|5.0|I thought this was an amazing piece of writing, with really great art. Shows the parallels and contrasts between Batman and Gordon, as well as the beginning of their relationship. Reveals alot of the symbolism between the characters. My only complaint is that it's pretty short, around half of the content of the book you'll get is additional material and concept art. That was a bit disappointing, since the story left me wanting more like this.
B009R659L8|4.0|I saw Mary Higgins Clark interviewed on EWTN and wanted to read something by her.  I couldn't believe she was still writing in her eighties amazing.  I really enjoyed the book.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I highly recommend this app. I have a kindle fire and this app is fantastic. You can put in multiple sites on your favorites list.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I liked this novel most, of the Gaiman stories I've read. (I liked them all) He sets the scene in prosaic suburban England, at a time of stress for the protagonist, who takes a short drive to escape and stops and remembers events of his childhood. The narrator took me to a Dunsanian world of beauty, terror and kindness, on the edges of the world we know, that  somehow seems almost true. The terrifying parts are so suspenseful that I kept reading when I should have been sleeping. I love how Gaiman blurs the line between real and imagined events for the protagonist and other characters in the novel; reminding me of the malleiablity of  experience.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Awesome......all the things you want in a game!!! Mystery thrill and gets you really thinking! I have such a hard time putting it down! I love it!<br />BY
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|Love the fact that I can use this device as a battery back-up for my iphone5.  I can also immediately share photos from my Canon EOS 60D to my social networks via the SD card slot.  This device expanded my iPad's memory as well. I needed to do was insert my 32Gb Datatraveler and instant expansion.

B00DQVST76|4.0|It's official. Madonna's time has come, and I do not mean this in a bad way. Evolution is a part of life in every sense of the word. I watched several segments of this tour, and I just couldn't take anymore. I'm bored, and restless with her performing the same songs/routines on each, and every tour. Am I the only one who's over it? Madonna's songs are divine, but you can pretty much list the songs in your head that will be performed at each event. Whether it be a Tour, or guest appearance. Those same 8 songs will be performed until her death-day.<br /><br />Being that Madonna is not a supreme vocalist there's only so far she can go with these same 8 songs, this is boring. It's not like a powerhouse who hits different notes each tour, so the songs are never interesting. Especially, when you listen to Madonna year round [as I do]. The newer shows are only subpar, due to age, attitude, and several other factors.<br /><br />Madonna in her 20's, and 30's was raunchy, hip, and glam. Even into her 40's, she continued to make her mark. Seeing her today, she still looks good, obviously, but, her demeanor has changed. She seems to be a woman who's exhaled, enjoys entertaining, and living in the moment -- versus, getting on stage, dominating a show, and striking a pose after an 8-count/routine. The shows were better when she had more to prove. Clearly, she's past this time in her life, and she should be. She's a Mom in her 50's, having a blast on stage like the 'good ole' days.<br /><br />Madonna has nothing to prove these days. As a result, her shows are no longer stimulating. It's comparative to when the coyote nails the roadrunner after decades of trying, desperately. Watching him in distress created a great show! It was a thrill to see what writers would pull out of their butts for each new episode. We were constantly on the edge of our seats, anticipating the next show! But, once the Roadrunner is caught, and the glass is now broken -- are we still not over it? Is it imperetive to wait for more, or can we suddenly do without at this point? Any new screen plays would be uninteresting and/or pointless.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier -- I tune into Madonna in top-form throughout the course of the year. So, to see and/or hear performances such as this tour are uninteresting. However, I do respect that she's fortunate to still be with us, continuing to do what she loves most; getting on stage! It's a beautiful life, and it's great to see she's still living her dream.<br /><br />Another 'Madonna issue', is that she's not recorded music within the last 5 years that she can age gracefully with. &#34;Not a good look.&#34; Her latest music is a wreck. For this reason, she's only able to repeatedly perform the same, tired ,'8 or 10' songs in the same fashion every single concert. She's too 'mature' to perform any of her current work, and she's not vocally creative enough to add any interest to the older work. The studio can make you sound 25, but the cameras can't make you look it. Something to consider...<br /><br />Madonna is gorgeous! she's the greatest, but, this is what is called 'tough-love'. I will not be a sheep for her slaughter. Madonna is just an outter shell of who she used to be, this is her own fault. Her last two records contain no work that she can potentially carry on a decent show with, or none that she looks good performing today. Overall, her current tour is respectable, but nothing I would watch ever again. I expected to hear something that I would desperatley need to convert to MP3, since most of her live shows are known to contain better versions of the studio-recordings. Unfortunately, nothing here is converter-worthy, the actual album is better -- is this saying anything?.<br /><br />It's frightening, knowing that each of our current popstars are trailing in Madonna's footsteps, recording senseless, or meaningless music with poor craftsmanship, and to know that this is what their catalogs of music will consist of until they're [also] in their 50's. Rihanna, and Britney are the first to cross my mind while thinking of this disaster that's already happening.<br /><br />Being that Madonna was/is the first Pop/Superstar of her kind the earth wasn't inclined to what an older Madonna would be like by the age of 50. Madonna, Prince, Janet & Michael were the first generation of popstars who took it all to the next level. As of 2013, there is evidence that these individuals do, in fact, age. They aren't these immortal pop-beings as we subconsciously believed. We now will endure an entire generation's worth of children who have been influenced by these greats. As you can see, Janet is smart, she went into hiding. She will no longer be the butt of anyone's jokes.<br /><br />The point is, things would be different had Madonna steered her own ship instead of working to please a brand, or label -- or, being posessed by dollar signs. She took the gimmick route. Madonna, and my mother share the same birth-year. She looks identical to any of my Mother's acquaintences on stage hopping around singing these adolescent pop songs. I would love to see Madonna actually be more creative. Her older hits are her only leg to stand on and... I wont go any further, this review is getting longer than I wanted it to be, and I'm beginning to feel like I'm repeating myself. Don't wanna sound like a Madonna concert, or anything...<br /><br />So, was it good? For her age, yes. In general? It was basic. I used to look at Madonna wishing to be like her, someday. Now, I just look at her. Watching this show made me feel like I was on a crew ship, playing Bingo in my golden years while the staff puts on a show. Madonna will forever be my girl, but, after witnessing this tour I can't sit through another one. The next one will be when she's 60 with another party album? I cant, its embarrassing, but who am I? Do what makes YOU happy.<br /><br />Update: 9/12/2013, Wow, I see my copy's defects are not due to it's 'edition' according to the reviews. Hmmm...cross my mind while thinking of this disaster that's already happening.  Being that Madonna was/is the first Pop/Superstar of her kind the earth wasn't inclined to what an older Madonna would be like by the age of 50. Madonna, Prince, Janet & Michael were the first generation of popstars who took it all to the next level. As of 2013, there is evidence that these individuals do, in fact, age.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was an excellent read.  It not only told the struggle of one man's demon of drugs, but also what a warrior he was for our country.  The disabilities he acquired through the course of his military life and overcoming those with strength, courage and the blessing of God.  If only more people believed in the abilities of our Almighty God. This is the third book I have read on our Navy Seals and the training and battles they go through, and I just can't seem to get enough.  I love the Navy SEALS!!!

This is a question of extreme importance that should not be flippantly disregarded or answered too quickly by skeptics. The evidence should be weighed and examined carefully by the rational mind, ready at any moment to wholeheartedly embrace the best explanation. There is no doubt many have already reached a false conclusion and embraced atheism based on the content of Richard Dawkins latest book, \\"The God Delusion.\\" The Oxford University professor asserts that such a position \\"is nothing to be apologetic about. On the contrary it is something to be proud of. \\" In fact, the goal of the book is not so much to equip confident unbelievers, but it clearly targets \\"religious readers,\\" more specifically, Christians, in hopes that they will be \\"atheists when they put it down. \\" This is a bold and seemingly confident attempt to demonstrate how the Christian faith is nothing more than \\"a false belief or impression. \\" The skeptic may immediately be tempted to simply take Dawkins' word for it and continue on with life as if there is no God. However, such a decision cannot claim to be supported by evidence or even science. It is nothing more than faith in another man, Dawkins. A rational mind, by definition, must examine the evidence and make a decision as an individual. Besides, the book is filled with many logical fallacies and fails to make clear distinctions in many areas. It is not unreasonable to propose that Dawkins creates confusion in practically every chapter of the book. He certainly has not demonstrated that God is a delusion and Christianity is a false belief system. Despite the credentials and reputation the professor may have, he appears to be the one who has been deluded. The goal of this paper is to bring clarity where \\"The God Delusion\\" has only brought confusion and to demonstrate the rational supremacy of belief in the Christian God.<br /><br />First of all, the God of the Bible does not expect His followers to ignore scientific evidence.<br />Christianity is not a blind faith that encourages believers to ignore or reject scientific evidence of any kind. Yet Dawkins repeatedly makes assertions such as, Christianity \\"teaches children that unquestioned faith is a virtue. You don't have to make the case for what you believe. \\" Nothing could be further from the truth. While many pastors and churches have certainly chosen to ignore the role of science in apologetics, others are experiencing an apologetics revival today because the authoritative Christian Scriptures support the movement (Psalm 19:1). It certainly would take historical revisionism to erase the incredible role of apologetics and science played in the early church. Such statements are clearly fallacious, but the point is Dawkins seems to use them as more of a personal attack, intent on belittling the believer and causing confusion. One of the major reasons for this ambiguity is because Dawkins continually makes broad statements, never distinguishing between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. One may rightly make the case that Muhammad, the Qur'an, and modern day Muslims all agree that the Qur'anic Scriptures should never be questioned, even in light of contradictory evidence. However to place Christianity into the same broad category is deceptive and a \\"straw man\\" at best.  Any follower of Christ who has spent much time studying and learning the teachings of the biblical God would immediately recognize the blatant contradiction of Christianity as a \\"blind faith.\\" He certainly would not rightly conclude that his choice of faith disregards the need for evidence.<br /><br />Clearly the biblical God expects believers and unbelievers to logically examine evidence for His existence. In the Old Testament God reveals His power on more than one occasion (Exodus 14:31) and He invites unbelievers to \\"Come now, let us reason together (Isaiah 1:18).  The New Testament is also filled with the miraculous works of Jesus, confirming His message from God. In contrast to Dawkins' assertion about questions that believers \\"would much rather not be asked\\" because it \\"embarrasses\\" them , the Bible says to \\"always be ready\\" to answer the skeptic (1 Peter 3:15). One must wonder how it is possible for Dawkins to conclude that \\"religious people know without evidence. \\" Either he does not know the content of the Bible or he is just being outright deceptive.<br /><br />Neither is it a valid argument to quote Steven Layfield, who rejects the notion of \\"Two books, the book of nature and the Scriptures\\" in an attempt to demonstrate that Christians are guilty by association.  Regardless of the context of this quote, such a person does not usurp the role of the Bible as the standard for Christianity. The Bible clearly teaches that God has revealed Himself in two ways, through His creation (Romans 1:19-20) and the Scriptures (2 Timothy 3:16). Anyone who refers to the Bible as the only revelation of God makes a self-defeating statement, denying not only science, but the very book they have used to support their claim. \\"That which is known about God\\" can be observed in the natural world or \\"clearly seen, being understood through what has been made\\" (Romans 1:20). When the Christian Scriptures propose that God has revealed knowledge about Himself apart from the Bible, it makes no sense to use the Bible to say that He has not. Such quotes may sell a book or two, adding fuel to the atheist mind, but they are fallacious. Of course, all belief systems throughout history have endured people who misrepresent them. One would not have to spend a lot of time searching the internet to discover a plethora of those who misrepresent science in the name of atheism. Yet no Christian apologist would suggest that these people represent the scientific community. Also, it seems safe to say that Dawkins would not allow anyone to place him in the same category as thecreation science book which claims the earth is only 6,000 years old. He would be appalled and maybe even laugh at any attempt to make a valid point in this context. The atheist as well as the Christian rightly expects to be fairly and accurately represented.<br /><br />This lack of credible evidence speaks volumes about the bias of Dawkins and his disingenuous stance towards the scientific evidence which does not support his atheism. Again, much of the book is devoted to belittling those who do believe in God and the thought of Dawkins being open to evidence in support of God is practically non-existent. Believers will not even make it through the first chapter without being equated with those who \\"believe that there are fairies.\\" The content of the book is filled with much the same thing, such as equating believers with those who have \\"experienced a pink elephant.  Why not give some counter-evidence for some of the very convincing arguments given by leading Christian apologists? If it is so important for believers to be open-minded, why not admit the possibility of God and explain why he chose atheism? After reading his book, it would be very difficult for anyone to conclude that Dawkins weighs and considers evidence of any kind that disagrees with his worldview. Indeed, \\"there is a tendency in humans to see what they wish to see. \\"<br /><br />Faith or trust in someone or something is unavoidable and Dawkins is no exception. Once again, it is hard to miss his faith in naturalism while reading the \\"The God Delusion.\\" In fact, Dawkins is just as much a person of faith as Billy Graham or any other Christian. The only difference is the object of faith. Both diverge from the point of absolute certainty and travel down the road of trust or belief in what cannot possibly be proven. For example, Dawkins claims that \\"many of our human ailments, from lower back pain to hernias, prolapsed uteruses and our susceptibility to sinus infections, result directly from the fact thatwe now walk upright with a body that was shaped over hundreds of millions of years to walk on all fours.  Such a statement requires one to trust in macro-evolution. Dawkins does not know this, he believes it. Another obvious example can be found in his reference to a multi-verse having a \\"plethora of alternative sets of by-laws. \\" Christian apologist Greg Koukl points to Dawkins' admission that \\"there is currently no evidence for the multi-verse theory\\" among a short list of other things the New Atheists have faith in.  If Dawkins wishes atheism to hold the same level of respect that many religions today have, then he should be honest about where science ends and his faith begins.<br /><br />Secondly, science has not proven that the Christian God is a delusion.  The title of chapter four suggests that Dawkins is at least convinced that science and Darwinism have proved \\"Why there almost certainly is no God.\\" One should not overlook the use of the word \\"almost,\\" which seems to communicate at least the slight possibility of God's existence. Regardless, the content of the book suggests that natural selection has explained \\"the whole of life\\" and it \\"also raises our consciousness to the power of science to explain how organized complexity can emerge from simple beginnings without any deliberate guidance. \\"Simply put, God does not exist. Those who believe in God, especially the Christian God, have \\"been taught that truth comes from Scripture rather than from evidence. \\" Such statements are ambiguously misleading and suggest that science and religion contradict each other. The assertion here is that one must choose science or belief in God. However, John Lennox, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford, has rightly said that \\"the real battle is not so much between science and faith in God, but rather between a materialistic, or more broadly, a naturalistic worldview and a supernaturalistic, or theistic worldview. \\" Science and Christianity are not at odds. Infact, the Christian scientists could say that \\"This is better than we thought. \\"<br /><br />Of course, further confusion revolves around Dawkins' intended definition of the word \\"science.\\"  The current scientific community itself has not united in agreement around any one particular \\"scientific method\\" or definition.  This makes it difficult for one to fully comprehend the authors intended meaning, despite the context. To be fair, Dawkins does say that science is \\"evidence based\\" and \\"Natural selection is a better alternative\\" to a belief in a Designer God. \\" Although this statement seems to suggest that \\"The God Delusion\\" is not known with absolute certainty, it is a more accurate representation of how one should choose the \\"better alternative\\" based on scientific evidence. Observable or repeatable science should hold more authority than other methodologies and it has by no means proven that atheism should not be questioned. Neither has it proven that the Christian God exists with absolute certainty, but there are many valid reasons, based on scientific knowledge, to suggest that it should be an alternative.<br /><br />There are many things to consider in regards to the explanatory limits of science. There are boundaries or certain areas that science cannot offer any evidence. For example, Dawkins and the new atheists may belittle Christians for their belief in miracles, but \\"science cannot say that miracles do not occur. Only that they are highly improbable. \\" The scientist will never observe the greatest miracle of all, the beginning of the universe. Neither does Darwinian naturalism offer an explanation for how life began. Perhaps one of the greatest areas of limitation for science is that of morality and why certain acts are morally right or wrong. While it may be capable of explaining the natural details or even predicting future Tsunamis and earthquakes, it cannot sufficiently explain why the resulting loss of human lives should be considered evil. After all, this is what \\"natural selection\\" does. Neither does it give objective moral grounds to condemn someone who has taken another human life. Science in no way gives humanity an objective standard to measure such acts as good or evil. These are just a few examples of the limitations of science that are problematic for Dawkins.<br /><br />Dawkins may be able to eloquently explain how natural mechanisms work, but he has by no means disproved the existence of a divine agent in doing so. There is still the logical possibility of God existing outside the observable universe where science cannot reach. Lennox has rightly pointed out the \\"elementary category mistake\\" of arguing that \\"just because we understand a mechanism that accounts for a particular phenomenon, there is no agent that designed the mechanism.\\" This is a rational and valid point that Dawkins disregards only because of the intrinsic presuppositions of his worldview. He does so even though our world is filled with mechanisms such as watches, cars, and planes which are designed and built by intelligent engineers. No one would consider these designers as competing or contradictory to the mechanisms they created. The only thing Dawkins has proven here is his ability to create confusion.<br /><br />The entire book relies on the incoherent and self-defeating logic of evolution. From cover to cover Dawkins vigorously attempts to demonstrate how God is a delusion in the mind of the theist and atheism is a good indication of \\"a healthy mind. \\" The major problem here is the epistemological incoherence of any attempt to demonstrate how belief in God is a false belief system produced by natural selection. If it is possible for evolution to produce a false belief in God, then it is also possible for other beliefs to be false, including Darwinism, natural selection, and atheism. It is fallacious to embrace the atheistic world-view, which admits that our cognitive faculties cannot be trusted, and dogmatically trust in the authority of scientific knowledge. This one simple point discredits most of the assertions made by Dawkins and the scientific methodology used by the new atheist today.<br /><br />He readily admits that \\"natural selection will favor individuals who devote the time and energy\\" to \\"surviving and reproducing\\" and \\"Ruthless utilitarianism trumps, even if it doesn't always seem that way. \\" In other words the cognitive reliability of the brain to comprehend truth is not essential to the process, but that which produces the greatest happiness is. This statement does a terrible injustice to modern science in a number of different ways. Mainly, the problem of whom or what has the unique privilege of defining \\"Utilitarianism\\" or the greatest happiness. If there is no God, then there is no objective standard for truth and the individual is left to pursue what makes them happy. Of course, this conflicts with the happiness of others and hence the problem. What makes one person happy usually comes at the expense of another. Natural selection may produce the next generation of species, but what they truly believe or comprehend may or may not correspond to reality.<br /><br />Atheism falls short in explaining logic and reason because scientist has never demonstrated how rationality can come from non-rationality. Observational science does establish with reasonable certainty how and why an effect depends on a greater or more powerful cause. This is the principle of causality and when contrasted with the logic of evolutionary atheism, it should be understood as self-evident. Dr. Norman Geisler appropriately points out that \\"all natural knowledge about the external world depends on a causal connection between it and our minds. \\" Yet the evolutionary worldview of Dawkins proposes that the effect, rational man, was engineered and constructed by the irrational and unguided cause of natural selection.<br /><br />Once this is exposed it becomes increasingly clear why Dawkins and the new atheists wish to silence those who stand in opposition Darwinian evolution. They may not necessarily come out and admit this as part of their goals, but the rhetoric of the persistent Ad Hominem presents strong evidence that it is so. Throughout the book theists are constantly demeaned or put down for their belief in God and science is held up as the ultimate authority. Dawkins, speaking of NOMA or \\"non-overlapping magisterial,\\" asks, \\"What expertise could theologians bring to the deep cosmological questions that scientists cannot? \\" After reading this section of the book one should have no problem understanding that Dawkins believes theists ask irrational questions, theologians have no intelligent input capable of refuting the scientist, and theology may not even be \\"a subject at all. \\" All of these conclusions are supported very little in the way of evidence and rely more on the assumption that theism is just too ridiculous to even consider. The Christian apologist will in turn repay the favor and ignore most of the content of Dawkins' book. However, it is worthwhile to point out that most of these defenders of the Christian faith would much rather be intellectually challenged. Personal attacks prove nothing, but they can and usually do have the effect of silencing the opposition, especially those ill-equipped to give a reasonable answer. Professor Dawkins may rightly spend some of the content of his book condemning the Taliban for physically persecuting those who insult the religion of Islam; he is guilty of intellectual persecution himself.<br /><br />The third area of confusion concerns morality and acknowledging what modern Christian apologists are actually saying. When it comes to morals, Dawkins dedicates a considerable amount of space answering irrelevant questions. For example, the case for Christianity does not depend on, \\"How, without religion,\\" can someone \\"be good, or would even want to be good? \\" Neither does it depend on how \\"religious people differ fromatheists in their moral intuitions. \\" It seems quite obvious that the atheist can behave in a moral fashion \\"without religion\\" and the common Moral Argument for God's existence is built on universal similarities, not how we \\"differ.\\" Dawkins' concentration on these irrelevant \\"Straw Men\\" comes across as very disingenuous. It is hard to miss the irony, especially considering his moralist position. He viciously condemns Islam, those who mistreat homosexuals, and those who force religion on children, just to name a few. Dawkins has no problem abandoning Natural Selection for moral ground when it is convenient for his worldview. Such an inconsistent position will come across as reasonable only if the reader does not recognize how it borrows from the Christian worldview.<br /><br />The Natural Law or universal Moral Law presents strong evidence for a Moral Lawgiver. One of the major problems for Dawkins and the new atheists is the concept of objective morality. If there is no God, objective moral values and duties do not exist. Of course, Dawkins asserts that \\"morals do not have to be absolute. \\" Once again, he is confused; his assertion is self-defeating and logically incoherent. Dawkins systematically puts forward an absolute moral plan suggesting how one ought to behave and condemns those who do not. If \\"morals do not have to be absolute\\" then what difference does his statement make? Also, practically everyone has the ability to recognize immorality once they are on the receiving end of someone else's immoral behavior. It may seem like no big deal when one someone is murdered across town, but everyone recognizes such an act as absolutely wrong if they have a personal connection to the victim. This is absolutely true today and there is not the slightest evidence to suggest that anyone from history would have a different perspective. The notion that \\"Even Adolf Hitler, widely regarded as pushing the envelope of evil into uncharted territory, would not have stood out inthe time of Caligula and Genghis Khan\\" is unsupported.  Dawkins would certainly recognize similar evil if he were a Jew awaiting execution by Hitler, regardless of the historical setting. Objective morality is inescapable and yet it cannot be explained apart from God. Paul Copan states that \\"When morality is severed from its theological roots, secular ethics cannot sustain itself - it withers and dies. \\" The atheist is left without an objective moral standard, intrinsic value as a human, or even a mind that can be trusted to make the correct moral decisions. Interestingly, the Trinitarian God of the Bible, existing as three coequal and coeternal persons, provides the best explanation for all of these.<br /><br />Morality deals with how persons treat each other and the Darwinian explanation for the origin of life as an impersonal \\"chemical event \\" leaves morality without a sufficient explanation. The stability of the entire world depends on how individuals, governments, and differing cultures interact with each other. Mankind will never achieve world peace or even come remotely close as long as the world is viewed from an evolutionary perspective. Dawkins may rightly claim that \\"Religion is undoubtedly a divisive force,\\" but it is absurd to think that \\"Without religion, and religiously segregated education, the divide would simply not be there. \\" Not only would division exist without religion, but Natural Selection is by nature divisive, supporting and thriving on division. The weak cease to exist and the strong reproduce. The lion does not murder the gazelle, it has lunch. The male dog does not rape the female when it forcefully copulates with her; this is what animals in the natural world do. Mankind is clearly different and set apart, having moral intuitions. Evolution does not come remotely close to explaining why man has this intrinsic value and the need to treat other persons in a moral way.<br /><br />The Moral Law, which is intrinsic to every person, is confirmed by the Christian Scriptures. The Bible precisely addresses every person saying that objective morality is \\"written in their hearts\\" (Romans 2:15). Christians hold this book to be supreme moral instructions because it comes from a morally perfect and personal God. However, they should not deny how it records the good, bad, and ugly concerning man's condition. Despite what Salman Rushdie may say, \\"the problem's name\\" is not \\"God, \\" it is man. The Bible does not hide this in any way. Therefore, it is irrelevant for Dawkins or John Shelby Spong to point to \\"The Sins of the Scriptures\\" and the moral failures of the persons in the Bible.  Jesus is the only person ever held up as the supreme example because He is the only one \\"Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth\\" (1 Peter 2:22). Why would Dawkins make such an argument? Is it just another \\"Straw Man\\" for him to tear down? Once again, it makes no sense to argue that Christians \\"do not understand\\" the Bible while making such an obvious elementary mistake.  The moral guidelines as recorded in the Bible are given as a means to expose and remind mankind of his natural tendency for immoral behavior. The Word of God confirms on a personal level the problem of immorality and the need for every individual \\"to love your neighbor as yourself\\" (Matthew 12:29).<br /><br />The atheist, on the other hand, has no moral foundation or objective reason to interact with other people in a morally appropriate way. Darwinian evolution promotes a self-centered worldview, not what is morally right or wrong.  If there is no God, then it certainly follows that humanity would be inclined to behave in an egotistical way. The actions of small children, who have not even thought about the existence of God, demonstrate how easily selfish behavior can prove to be a problem. To suggest that \\"there is not the smallest evidence\\" to support \\"whether atheism systematically influences people to do bad things\\" is unsupported.  It is muchmore reasonable to believe that atheism, which offers no hope or purpose, will lead humanity to behave in an immoral way. Where there are no consequences or accountability individuals will do as they please and chaos is the end result. Surely Dawkins does not believe that mankind has no need for \\"policing - whether by God or by each other. \\" A skyscraper is not built without some objective standard to guide the process and neither is a moral society. Nevertheless, Dawkins vehemently proposes that a world without religion will lead to a positive solution for mans immoral behavior.<br /><br />The fourth area of confusion involves how Christianity is repeatedly misrepresented. The Christian faith is depicted as equivalent to the Taliban and Islamic terrorism. In order to make this description appear reasonable, Dawkins must appeal to behavior done in the name of religion, instead of the example of Christ and the Christian Scriptures. Anyone who has a basic understanding of \\"all three Abrahamic religions\\" should easily conclude that they are not \\"indistinguishable. \\" There are major differences which dramatically impact how one should and should not behave. There are a large group of Muslims who believe that the Qur'an condones and supports violence for the cause of Allah and they have Qur'anic verses to support their faith. The New Testament Scriptures clearly and unambiguously condemn such behavior. Anyone who murders an abortion doctor, supports slavery, and oppresses others based on their ethnicity, gender or cultural status behaves in a way that is contradictory to the Christian faith. They are confused and have misunderstood what it means to be a Christian.<br /><br />It is quite ironic that Dawkins would begin his book with the topics of \\"respect\\" and \\"undeserved respect.\\" Respect is usually associated with two characteristics highly valued and inherent to Christianity, integrity and consistency. Neither of these appears to be present in The God Delusion. \\"It isa matter of etiquette,\\" but unless the professor is willing to leave the broad category of religion and speak honestly about Christianity, his statements are very hypocritical and unscholarly. Dawkins is perplexed as to why \\"religious faith is especially vulnerable to offence and should be protected by an abnormally thick wall of respect, in a different class from the respect that any human being should pay to any other. \\" Perhaps he should do a little more research concerning the core doctrines of Christianity and rewrite his book portraying the faith in an accurate way. This would at least earn him a little respect in the Christian community.<br /><br />The Christian faith is still based on the example of Christ Himself and those who trust or believe Him should \\"follow in His steps\\" (1 Peter 2:21). Dawkins' assumed definition and resulting use of the word is actually the antithesis of this example. \\"It is the disciples\\" or students who learned to live and behave like Jesus that \\"were first called Christians at Antioch\\" (Acts 11:26). They were Christ-like, \\"transformed to the point that they endured persecution and even martyrdom. \\" They learned to respond to evil in a non-violent way from the instructions and example of Christ Himself. He commanded all Christians to \\"love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\\" (Matthew 5:44). He also told Peter, who had just cut the ear off of \\"the slave of the high priest,\\" to \\"Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword\\" (Matthew 26:52). The life and teachings of Jesus simply do not corroborate with Dawkins' accusations. One may argue that there are hostile Christians, and there certainly are, but there is very little rational ground to support a violent Christianity by pointing to those who have misrepresented the faith. They have deserted their leader and His guidelines and strayed off on a different path.<br /><br />How Christianity differs from violent Islam is of utmost importance. If one chooses to focus only on their similarities then neither faith will be represented in an accurate way. Yet Dawkins says for his purposes, \\"the differences matter less than the similarities. \\" Is he intentionally trying to create confusion around the use of the word \\"Christianity?\\" Perhaps not, but the majority of his argument against a supernatural God is built on a counterfeit Christianity. A phony belief system is recognized in much the same way one would recognize fake currency, by examining the differences. The two belief systems lead down very different paths with contradictory views of God, Jesus, and morality. Whether good or bad, a Muslim should be expected to behave differently than a Christian and vice versa. So why misrepresent either faith and place them in the broad category of religion which only acknowledges a single similarity, belief in God? This only creates confusion.<br /><br />The fifth area of confusion deals with the trustworthiness of the Christian Scriptures. More specifically, are the Gospels reliable? Dawkins concludes, \\"The only difference between The Da Vinci Code and the gospels is that the gospels are ancient fiction while The Da Vinci Code is modern fiction. \\" This claim ignores the overwhelming manuscript and archeological evidence in favor of a few supposed contradictions in the Bible. The basic assumption of this part of the book presupposes a concocted religious agenda instead of historical accuracy and therefore, the contradictions. It is the usual argument proposing that the Bible has been changed over time by fallible men.<br /><br />However, it is self-defeating for Dawkins to argue that Jesus did not claim \\"divine status\\" from a position that also argues the Gospels are not trustworthy because they \\"were written long after the death of Jesus. \\" If they are trustworthy enough to conclude that Jesus never claimed to be God, then they should be trustworthy enough to reach other conclusions.<br /><br />If the Bible is not trustworthy, then there are no respectable reasons to trust any other book from antiquity. The Bible stands alone and supreme, surpassing all other ancient books with overwhelming evidence to support its content. It is confirmed by earlier manuscripts, more manuscripts, more accurately copied manuscripts, and more abundantly supported manuscripts.  Dr. Peter Williams, speaking on this very subject, points out how even the Biblical names match the most common Jewish names from this time period. The Lexicon of Jewish Names in Late Antiquity illustrates how impossible it would have been for 4 different authors writing in 5 different books to get these names right.  Williams also points out that the Bible gets it right in the area of agriculture, botany, geography, etc. Unlike other religious books the Bible is filled with detailed accounts which can be verified. For example, \\"Archeologists confirm that Luke named thirty-two countries, fifty-four cities, nine islands, and hundreds of details without making a single error. \\" Furthermore, the Bible contains many embarrassing details, such as the women finding the empty tomb while the men were cowering in fear, which should not have been included; if indeed there was some sort of \\"religious agenda.\\" With the elementary mistakes already discussed in mind, one cannot help but wonder if Dawkins actually spent a great deal of time researching and contemplating his conclusions about the Bible.<br /><br />After all, he does make some rather odd statements, such as, \\"The historical evidence that Jesus claimed any sort of divine status is minimal. \\" Unfortunately he does not define what he means by \\"historical evidence\\" or offer any proof to support the statement. Nevertheless, history can speak for itself and demonstrate how ludicrous the comment is. It is hard to imagine how anyone could read the Bible and not conclude that Jesus believed He was the Messiah, the Christ (John 4:26). There are many other examples to be found in the Christian Scriptures, but perhaps a few non-Biblical sources would be more effective in refuting this claim. Josephus speaks of James, \\"the brother of Jesus who was called Christ. \\" His use of the word \\"Christ\\" communicates that there was a group of people who believed He was indeed the long awaited Messiah. Tacitus, who is regarded as \\"the greatest of the Roman historians\\" records how Nero persecuted those \\"whom the common people called Christians\\" and how \\"their name comes from Christ, who, during the reign of Tiberius, had been executed by the procurator Pontius Pilate. \\" Not only does this evidence support how early Christians were convinced of Jesus divine nature, but it also gives some of the details concerning Jesus' death as recorded in the Gospels. There are many other examples including Thallus, Lucian, the apostolic fathers, Clement of Rome, and Polycarp. It is hardly fair or accurate to declare that history does not provide suf

6305127646|5.0|This DVD plays perfectly!  The color, quality, cover and case are perfect!  I love this movie, and could not be happier!
B000089770|5.0|Sometimes you get lucky, and when I went to the theater to beat the heat on a blazingly hot afternoon I took a chance on a film I had never heard of.  Turns out that SMOKE is brilliant, and one of my top ten films.  Forest Whitaker (who appears on screen for all of ten minutes) gives an amazing performance.  And I've always loved William Hurt's \\"less-is-more\\" style of acting.  This is a character and dialogue driven film, but that is not to say it doesn't have a compelling plot, a little suspense, and perhaps a bit too much melodrama.  Easily 5 stars.
B00821OX98|4.0|I HAVE ENJOYED SCI-FI SINCE I READ MY FIRST PULP MAGAZINE. DUG A BUNCH OF PULPS OUT OF THE TRASH. SO THIS IS HOW FAR I HAVE COME.  ALIEN INVADERS AND END OF THE WORLD I REALLY ENJOY.  FALLING SKIES FILLS BOTH<br />OF THESE AREAS.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The women in our family are just nuts about Downton Abbey. We're Anglophiles anyway, with heritage from Devon and the Stonehenge area. Why wouldn't we just live every minute of the superb acting, Maggie Smith's perfect delivery of zingers, and the surprises thrown into each episode?  Bravo.  Just wish there wasn't such a lag between seasons...or that we could jump on a plane for London!
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This is the funniest movie I have ever seen!  I have watched it now a dozen or more times and every time I see something new!
B005FSI1IK|5.0|I love how Bujold's characters suck me in to their world. And with the Vorkosigan Saga having multiple books, the fun goes on for weeks of reading! Bujold is my new favorite author.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Ok, so I finally got a chance to read this book, and I have one word for it...AMAZING!  I absolutely loved it.  It was one of the best books I have ever read.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't yet read it and is looking for something new to read.  I am definitely ready to read her other 2 books Dark Places and Sharp Objects.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|I seldom give 5 stars and I generally find &quot;free&quot; games wanting. Not here. All promises delivered in this visually cool and realistic air-hockey simulation. Both fun and challenging, and even if it weren't free, this is definitely one of the better game apps out there.
B002UQHYK6|4.0|kept my interest from start to finish loved it, great charachters and well researched any free time I had i opened it really riveting

1476719071|5.0|Beautiful story by a talented writer.  Jamie McGuire has a fan/ reader for life with me.  I have bought the paperback twice and a signed hard cover, as well as an e-reader copy.  I keep spreading the word about Travis and Abby.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|The Tower genre... is like a multi-level chess game.  The variability is complex and the level of complexity is up to you.  I've seen others and who invented it should be figured out so we can prosecute the pusher.  Funny thing is I don't get the Missle Command...Asteroids dreams/nitemares....Know what I mean ??  Wish I could see the F-MRI because the epic moments come at every turn and tower placement.  I think JeezBall started it personally.<br />Problem on this 9/2013 version on my K-Fire is that it  has crashed several times right in the middle of a solution...Like an NSA email bot...or worse ....a far right wing conspiracy ....Imagine mano-a-mano battle ...it would make the Syria issue a Toy Story like endeavor (except for the women and children deaths)  Stop Wars.!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|It's hard to find a good gaming mouse under 50 dollars with so many features Anker has.<br /><br />Pros: Lots of options: Three side buttons, micro weights to adjust the feel of the mouse to your taste, adjustable dpi, macro programming for mouse buttons that stores inside the mouse (not on your computer).  Any LED color you want under the sun (Only the back symbol anchor symbol is changeable), a tough braided cord, not a flimsy one, and a nifty driver program to fine tune your mouse.  (from the website).<br /><br />Cons: Only a few but my own tastes dictate these.  Anchor is the symbol on the mouse, and the company.  I  wish it was a different design.  (reminds me of a cliche sailors tattoo).  I'd like a longer, not as tall and wider mouse. The last mouse a Mionix was a more comfortable fit. This one I have to cup my hand to move the mouse around.  The three side buttons need to be slightly receded.<br /><br />Other thoughts:  If this was an 80 dollar high end gaming mouse I'd give it 4 stars out of 5.  For the price I picked this up from amazon I consider it a steal!  Overall a great product Anker.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Paul can still hold an audience and he has the clout to pull together a great team that got the job done. Diana Krall was the glue that made the whole thing fly.
B00AEBB89W|5.0|Excellent seller and excellent product
B0031OCY2E|3.0|What I have to say to begin with is that this movie is rated R and I would rate it G.  There is no sex, no violence and no profanity.  It would not even rate a PG-13 in my view.  I think that they tacked on the R to pump up sales which is a rip off.<br /><br />Having said that this is another illustration that truth is often stranger than fiction.  It is the true story of a bumbling con man and pathological liar.  Mark Whiteacre is a brilliant scientist but suffers from a narcissistic personality disorder and can't see his own ridiculous behavior.  I would buy a used copy and not spend full price for<br />this mildly entertaining story
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|Many have pointed out what they see as shortcomings of this film. No explanations for the avian assaults, an ambiguous ending, heck it doesn't even have a soundtrack.<br /><br />But these omissions are its unique strengths. The total lack of explanation leaves you uneasy. The non-ending leaves a disturbing and uneasy situation unresolved. The missing soundtrack leaves you with pure, unadulterated atmosphere.<br /><br />In fact, in adapting Du Maurier's short story, Hitchcock deliberately stripped-out the elements that made sense of it.<br /><br />Possibly, the only borrowed element is the pacing, which follows the slow, brooding menace punctuated with action and terror of John Huston's Moby Dick.<br /><br />Even the most formulaic and conventional scene - the siege on the Tides restaurant, is staged uniquely and brilliantly.<br /><br />In a sense, The Birds is a highly experimental, avant-garde anti-movie, and to that end it succeeds brilliantly. Everyone whose seen it, remembers it vividly, hauntingly.<br /><br />Lets hope nobody ever attempts a remake.
B00337KM2S|4.0|George Clooney falls hard for a woman that is up for friends with benefits only to find that she is married.<br />This eternal batchelor falls hard and is heartbroken.

George Clooney continues as this likable good guy.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I love this series.  Plenty of extra content.  Almost as good as the books.  Why are they waiting so long to release season 3?
B003AWRMCE|5.0|Finally a western that has the patina of truth, guts and glory and mixed motives.<br /><br />Eastwood shows that he is not only a consummate actor but an even better director.<br /><br />I have seen this movie at least a half a dozen times and it never gets old.<br /><br />Superlatives just don't seem to fully describe this magnificent piece of film making

B0006GAOJA|5.0|Robert Deniro once again shows that he is up to any part and makes you believe.<br /><br />His performance was spot on as narcissistic fighter with some inner demons to fight<br />that he takes out on his family and wife.<br /><br />It shows the gritty underbelly of professional fighting and perhaps this is the reason<br />that pro boxing has been in decline for years.<br /><br />All in all a must see, especially for guys

B000I3P3EM|3.0|Despite some hokey dialogue, strange pacing and a not very tight storyline, this was an enjoyable movie. The blu-ray quality isn't on par with 'Wrath of Khan', but definitely passable. The highlight of the movie is Christopher Plummer as a Klingon commander.

0399162097|5.0|I am a huge Fowler fan. So I was excited to get my hands on this book! Now saying that, I had seen reviews way before I got it. However, I wasn't going to let that deter me from reading it. And I am glad it didn't. I loved this book to pieces!!!<br /><br />The Cooke family. Rosemary leads us back through her childhood and bares a terrible secret. Knocked me over I loved every minute of this wonderful read. I think one sentence in the book really sums up a lot of it is, \\"We both had secrets that the other might now know were secrets.\\" If that doesn't make you want to know the secrets, and just what it means, I don't know about you!!!<br /><br />Lots of memories of Fern, but I really loved the style in which this book was written. So different from the norm. I can't say enough about this book. I wished more people would have enjoyed it! I recommend it to all my reader friends!

B0088W6IMQ|5.0|It is a great series just as good as as the original &#34;Stargate SG1&#34;. I  watched the series when it originally was broadcast and I'm enjoying it just as much the second time around. The bad guys are truly evil. I started the second season a d they develop the  characters more and add a few more interesting characters..

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I already have the Kindle Fire on which I love to read my books all over the place. When I run out of battery, tho, I still have my cellphone if a tricky chapter was in progress and I just NEED to read it. Kindle for Android is not only as good as my actual Kindle device, but more up to date ass well. It's very easy to use and, contrary to what I expected in the small screen of my Android, very clear to read, but if you wish to download books from Amazon Cloud into your device, I recommend doing so while in a Wi Fi area, it doesn't download great with 3G.<br />Overall, I greatly recommend this App.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Toy Story has been one of the best movie franchises in history.  The characters originated in the Toy Story continue their journey, in Toy Story 3, of friendship and rowdy adventures while demonstrating loyalty, sincerity, kindness and fun.  In this latest version they must team up once again to defend against a new band of toys gone bad.  Its worth purchasing this as you will want to watch it again and again!
B0061S0A64|4.0|As the title of the comment suggests, the music that rises from this quirky app is quite soothing, and I can't seem to pull out of it for long periods of time.
B001FA0W5W|2.0|To say the author is not the greatest writer is an understatement. I understand the topics can oftern be technical and the discussions have a lot of merit, but if you can't explain it well, you should leave it to people who can (or at least get it edited), and there are plenty of those. For example, the book Traders, Guns and Money is also authored by a former trader but is much better written and engaging.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|I like this game. It's a good way to kill time. The only issue that I have with it is that there's no skip button. This may not be an issue for some but it is a big one to me. Ergo only three stars are given.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Loved the novel.  Saw the Robert Redford and Mia Farrow version of years ago.  The up-to-date version was true to the story with a modern twist.  LOVED how they portrayed the  outrageousness of the 20's decade for those who were very rich and very poor.  Loved that encompassed all levels of society and culture - very raw.  LOVED the effects, landscapes, costuming, and music.  I can go on but it's a MUST SEE movie!
B0086B5R9Y|5.0|Buy this book.  It will change your life.  You can use it and work it to every aspect of your life.  You will not be disappointed.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is the scary story of the couple who did everything right and were rewarded with an unforeseen event that forced them to clean out their friend closet and even consider a new lifestyle.Spoiler Alert: surprise ending!!!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Well written and an interesting read. Some aspects do seem to be rewashed from other books of this genre. Oblivious girl stuck in love triangle with supernatural powers in play.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|The only reason to select this option over the cell phone type of Facebook presentation was for the option to share something with a specific friend. Since it doesn't have that, it has non real benefit to me.

B00A7KKPDK|5.0|I wasn't sure about reading this book, but from the 1st page I was hooked.  I'm usually a slow reader but this<br />book had made anticipating the next page.  I loved it!! Now I am will buy her other books.

B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I like the theme of the book.  I think the book is wordy and wish the details surrounding the premis were richer
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is slim, well cut, and fits like a glove. Its exactly what i ordered and would expect from Amazon. They are the best!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I thought the story was rich in its details.  I love how this story reminded us of how tircherous slavery was and the power men had over women.  A book worth reading so we never forget oppression.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Awesome book have not had that much fun reading in a long time.  It brought back a ton of great memories of my childhood
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Best new Author of Science fiction I have read...Best page-turner since Micheal Crichton  I started with Shift  then read Wool either way a book not to be missed
B00A2H9OZS|4.0|This movie is a modified clone of Pitch Black with some very good fight scenes. Riddick as usual delivered with many stealthy battle tactics and tough guy remarks. The new alien animals were not as tough as the one in Pitch Black, however they did have an unusual way of fighting. I gave it 4 stars because the ending was weak. It's very much worth watching at the movies.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thought that season 3 was better that season 2.  I'm counting the days until season 4 to comes out.
B000641D2Y|5.0|this movie is an alltime classic along with the first one.  after that you can forget any others they are worthless  :)
B000KIPT30|4.0|I use this with my Tascam Interface when I do mobile recording. Makes playback easier for recording and is way cheaper than a rackmount headphone splitter that is costly. For the price, it's a good buy. Only thing is that it's not as loud for people tracking drums, but it works and is a great buy for mobile recording
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game- great for killing time on a subway ride :) great for your i-pad or android tablet.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Over sensationalized and over the top predictable with the drama... No good...  I would not read another even though I enjoyed the movie...
B001VEE5KK|5.0|This was a brilliant film and not easy to watch, but well worth it. It should be interpreted in two equally important ways. One as an allegory for how the generation after the Nazi era copes with the fallout from the horrifying brutality carried out by an entire generation of people. The second is a personal story of redemption and healing of a man who learns many lessons through his early love affair with a woman whose past is unexpectedly revealed to him.<br /><br />Michael falls in love with Hannah after she tends to him when he falls ill on a trolley and becomes sick near her apartment. She has a harshness about her but comforts a sobbing and sick Michael by hugging him in a motherly fashion and saying \\"It will be all right\\". When Michael gets home the doctor diagnoses him with Scarlet Fever and his mother quickly removes herself and her daughter from the room. We soon see the coldness of Michael's family and soon understand why he brings flowers to Hannah to thank her for her kindness. Michael's sexual awareness is awakened when he sees Hannah put on nylons through a crack in the door and an affair is born.<br /><br />Soon Michael reads to her and they are having incredible and intense sex.  He senses she cannot read but he is too in love with her to really notice anything else. Hannah gently teaches Michael about sex, but takes on a kind of slave master role, and her eyes reflect an enraged, almost lunatic fervor. Even when she becomes bizarrely controlling, Michael only becomes more obsessed with seeing her, being with her and it becomes his great secret from his family and from his growing group of school friends.<br />And yet Hannah abruptly leaves him, she leaves her own dwelling to escape him and this abandonment will effect Michael for most of his adult life.<br /><br />However, it's his secrecy and shame that almost undoes him, and until he comes to grips with and grows from his experience with Hannah, he remains remote in all his relationships, including his own daughter.  Several years later as a law student, he hears Hannah  state her case on her own behalf with regard to the brutalities that she herself participated in. The scene in the courtroom is a memorable one and Kate Winslet could have won that Oscar on the scene alone. In a pivotal moment, the interrogator asks her to write her name to prove if she wrote a report that states she and others slaughtered jews kept in a church. She is so ashamed of her secret that she cannot write that she says she doesn't need to write her name because she in fact admits that she did write the report. It is striking and horrifying that she was more ashamed of her inability to write than admit that she slaughtered jews. She goes to prison for 20 years and during that time,  Michael, now a middle aged man reflects on his past. When he gets to this point in his reflection, he remembers that he was encouraged by his teacher to share his information, because it was his obligation from a legal standpoint if it would affect her case and outcome,  but he decides not to. He is clearly conflicted about what to do as courtroom scene unfolds.<br /><br />So, now we watch Michael in his middle age come to an astonishly conclusion of his own. After no contact with her for all the years since she left him, he starts sending her tape recordings in prison of everything he read to her in those years. He kept a journal record of all of them, so he was able to do this. (Very German isn't it?) She is comforted and nourished by this and starts to teach herself to read and write and writes him letters and begs him for more. Michael keeps sending the tapes but doesn't answer her letters. His actions are astonishing because one would think if anything, he would have abandoned her after finding out her past. But no, and when a prison official calls him to ask him to come get her on her release day and help her find her way in the world, he is reluctant but affirmative and has his reunion with a disheveled, aged Hannah across a plain table. He is warm towards her and tells her he as a room and a job for her and he'll come get her next week. It is clear that he has come with the hope that his reading might have redeemed her in some way, but when he asks her what she learned, she says, \\"I learned to read\\".  It is clear Michael then realizes that learning to read would not help her learn to undo the perversity of her nazi perspective. With almost imperceptible nuance he gets up to leave and tells her he will come get her next week. She moves toward him awkwardly looking for a hug, but Michael is not giving her that. Shortly after, Hannah hangs herself, so when Michael comes next week with flowers but now as an adult (clearly a parallel symbol to the early years when he brought Hannah flowers to thank her) he is told this news.He packs up the lovely apartment he had arranged for Hannah and in the next scene he is driving with his daughter, shows her Hannah's grave and the movie ends with him beginning to tell her his secret \\"When I was 15, I got sick and a woman helped me.\\"<br /><br />Most of Michael's life was virtually ruined by this woman with a sordid past, present and future. However, Michael healed himself through reading to Hannah as an adult. And he was washed clean and revived and one could sense his stunning relief.  Even after finding out Hannah's horrible truth, he still tried to repay what he would always interpret as love, even as she treated her concentration camp victims similarly to him. She had them read to her, but she soon sent them to the gas chambers with little remorse, or at least little visible remorse. Was her remorse secret too?<br /><br /> Hannah took care of Michael at a very vulnerable youthful moment and she introduced him to young love. But even as Michael the man read to her by way of the tapes with what he thought was full knowledge of her, he was hopeful this would redeem her. But he saw that it didn't redeem her.  However,  thereading redeemed Michael. He repaid Hannah with a loving act in spite of what she did to others and ultimately did to him. And this loving act redeemed him because life is complicated and Michael learned that as an adult. He could be kind, but he could not hug her like she had hugged him when he was young, because he had been a young innocent, and now knew more about who she really had been, who she was and who she could ever be. She was not capable of learning from her mistakes of the past. Michael, however, could learn from the past and would not remain blinded by a stilted love any more and could now share his secret with his daughter and share true intimacy and love.  He grew up<br />This film had an unexpected and huge impact on me. This gave me a whole new perspective on healing and acceptance.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|Still hanging on the edge of my seat.  Every character is amazingly written.  Can't wait to see where it is all going...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It is for the mature individual, wouldn't want a teenager to get their hands on it!
B009EEMFSI|4.0|Read below.<br /><br />This is ridiculous that I need to write a certain amount of words for a review.  I do not feel that a certain amount of words warrant a &#34;review.&#34; Take a lesson from Netflix and allow me to just click the number of stars otherwise I will start coming up with ridiculous information to put in these boxes.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is very absorbing and fun. The visuals are amazing. The tutorial could be more thorough because I found it difficult to sort out all of the options. Other than that, I highly recommend it.
B008UWEFU6|2.0|I bought the whole set after reading all the wonderful reviews and how I have regretted spending the money on three books without having read at least part of Volume I. I hated the first book and would have stopped reading in the middle of it BUT here I had 3 whole books to go through! I think that each time Christian or Anastasia put their hands through their hair, or Anastasia bit her lower lip  I cringed from the sheer boredom of such repetitive actions. I wonder where the editor was through all this nerve racking repetition. The main theme was interesting but could have been developed in one volume, including the sex which was also tooooo much. Fortunately, after reading a few of such scenes, out of sheer curiosity,  it was easy to skip most of them but still, three whole books filled with kinky or \\"vanilla\\" sex is like eating the same thing every day for months on end.<br /><br />Fortunately I managed to skim through all 3 books in about 4 days but I will never again make the same mistake of buying a trilogy because other people think it is fabulous.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book keeps you glued to each page with all the twisted and insane turn of events that has your racing to finish each page to find out what's going to happen next. A most read book for anyone who likes \\"stories\\" (inside joke).
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Excellent movie!  Kept my attention throughout.  Great content and so nice to have a quality movie without all of the unnecessary foul language.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is tons of fun. I play it all the time. You can't make a mistake of where you placed the cards because the game won't let you make illegal moves so you can't placed cards in the wrong place.

B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|Fast delivery, great item. My Kids loved it! I recommend this product to others the price was perfect in comparison.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The pictures are so big that it is more than annoying, and is an irritant. Can't do highlight, copy, then paste.  I would consider it barely functional, but there are few choices available so you really have no choice.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|I came to The Walking Dead late - as in, only a month ago.  Since then, my son and I watched the first two series on Netflix, then ordered the third season on Blu-Ray via Amazon since it isn't available on Netflix yet.  What can I say about this series?  It's pretty much pitch perfect, IMO.  I have watched pretty much every Romero \\"Living Dead\\" movie, every Resident Evil movie, and played many video games that feature the zombie apocalypse or some variation thereof.  This series draws from each of those (my son and I had fun during the first season, pointing out the inspiration for certain scenes, set pieces and motifs), but it really takes the genre into new territory.  I'm only up to episode 4 of season 3 so far, but every episode since the first one of the first season has moved the plot forward, developed the relationship between the characters, and taken a new twist on the zombie apocalypse idea that makes you both squirm and applaud the writers.<br /><br />Every actor so far seems believable and true to their character.  But the characters are not static - they change in believable ways as the story line moves forward.  The young boy, for instance, who seemed rather annoying for a while, seems to be growing into a strong, hardened force of his own in a manner similar to the development of Anakin Skywalker - hopefully he'll turn out better, but either way it makes for engaging viewing.  Every other character gets their chance to add something to the story as well.<br /><br />The effects are terrific and modern, without looking particularly CGI (with the exception of one building explosion in Season 2).<br /><br />It takes a lot for me to become emotionally invested in a horror film, having seen hundreds since the 1970's, but this series has me on the edge of my seat nearly every episode.  Can't wait to finish season 3 and see what they come up with for season 4.  So far, IMO, this project is a genuine masterpiece on both a dramatic level and a horror/action level.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was recommend this book from someone at work and couldn't put it down.  There are twists and turns that make you want to keep reading!
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|Update!  The warranty is up and broke again, 4 times now.  This product is a piece of sh!t.  BUY THE WATER PROOF IPOD Broke in one week, Finis said they would replace but had to send broke one back, then they said the replacement would go out when they get to it. Great CS,  about as good as their crap product. Got the feeling they get a lot of returns!!!  Be careful.

B00B7FOQCK|4.0|I bought this because I found I needed far more USB ports than my laptop possessed.  So far, it seems to be working okay, but I have noticed that every now and then the indicator light will turn off and I'll have to move the cord around to get it to make a full connection.  I can't say for certain that I've noticed a faster speed out of the items plugged into the USB 3.0 port hub but it's definitely nice to have all my things plugged in and accessible.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Excellent descriptions.  Weak story that really leads to nowhere.  Very odd and unbelievable.  Would not have finished it if my book club had not recommended.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|What fun!  A game that requires a little thinking and planning.<br />I like being able to rework (take a Mulligan) and the various scenarios, attempting to see if I can figure out how to knock out all the &#34;bad guys&#34; in the minimum number of serves.  (Shots)<br /><br />Got it as the free app-o-the day, but had I known how it was going to grab me, I'd have paid for it.<br />Yes, it is fun.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever tried to watch...just couldn't see it through to waste anymore of my time.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Since I played the second one first I know a pretty good deal of the story but after playing 999 I was able to see how everything was set. Cant wait for the 3rd installment in the series!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This was a great film for the whole family. It has a bit of everything for everyone. Highly recomend it to all.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like this chess app because the level of play can be adjusted so that I am playing right at my level. Therefore sometimes I actually win!!!
B00DL47RQ2|4.0|Woody Allen has evolved from writer/director and sometime actor of comedies to dark dramas and various permutations.  Besides being one of the most prolific artists in moviemaking history, most of his films have been marked by strong storylines populated with colorful characters, sharp dialogue, and often ironic endings. Blue Jasmine is the latest film to showcase Allen's talent (yes at 77 he is very much in command of his medium), and he gets a bravura performance by Cate Blanchett.<br /><br />Jasmine (Blanchett) is a flamboyant soul who is flying from New York to San Francisco to stay with her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins).  Married to a successful businessman, Hal (Alec Baldwin), Jasmine has a life of high society and wealth.  But Hal is not what he seems, and she experiences the fallout from his womanizing and crooked investments.  This sets off a chain reaction of loss for the now penniless wife and mother.  Now dependent on the kindness of her sister who lost a life savings courtesy of Hal, she tries to find employment at a dentist office and take classes to find a career.  She is desperate and dependent on others, and when she meets Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard), the man of her dreams, the only thing between herself and nirvana is her hidden past.<br /><br />How to describe Jasmine? She is self absorbed, selfish, despondent, manic, alcoholic, vain, delusional, traumatized, judgmental, spoiled, and above all, depressed.  She is oblivious to the obvious and in denial of her reality.  Mentally unhinged and humiliated, she is a walking contradiction who indulges in lies and babbles to herself.<br /><br />The film employs stream of consciousness flashbacks that may seem abrupt at first, but you quickly see the device as a rapid succession of background information on how Jasmine's life has been filled with status and means only to devolve as Hal's philandering history is revealed.<br /><br />Allen has a gift for observing and depicting real people in conflict.  Both sisters come from different walks of life.  Both yearn for happiness, and yet when Jasmine falls on hard times, Ginger is there for her despite a rocky history together. There are obvious class divisions between the rich and poor, and the irony here is that Jasmine is now one of the latter.  There are obvious parallels to A Streetcar Named Desire, but Jasmine just might be more disturbed than Blanche DuBois.  In fact a case can be made that Jasmine will evolve into a character not unlike Judi Dench's pathetic spinster in Notes on a Scandal (also starring Blanchett).<br /><br />Kudos go to the usual Allen ensemble of top performers particularly Hawkins as the charitable sibling and Baldwin as a Bernie Madoff /Casanova.  Andrew Dice Clay has a supporting role as a man from Ginger's past who figures prominently later, and Louis C. K. is convincing as a romantic suitor who diverts Ginger from her boyfriend Chili (Bobby Cannavale).  But Blanchett inhabits her role in an eerie way; you believe her and all her quirks and mannerisms.  She is a mess of a person, and her struggles to find happiness and financial security are fleeting.  It's the sort of performance that earns an actress the Oscar.<br /><br />It is nice to see Allen expand his films' settings from his traditional New York environs to other locales, lately Europe and now San Francisco.  The film is beautifully shot in New York and California by Javier Aguirresarobe (Vicki Cristina Barcelona).  As usual, Allen employs period songs to accent a mood or scene especially the ironic tune \\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\\".<br /><br />As with the best Allen dramas like Interiors, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Match Point, the lead characters are imperfect people with serious problems, and it causes them to do desperate things that don't always work.  Allen does not always have happy endings in his dramas, and you get the impression that this story may not end well.  Life can be cruel, and in Blue Jasmine, how we deal with it can be a tortuous journey.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Works great, easy to use, will recommened to anyone.  I installed on my Samsung s2.  Have had no problems whatsoever.
B00A6WSTIW|4.0|The Deep Blue Sea is very thrilling and fast-moving. It is definitely an \\"R\\" movie, very graphic. I enjoyed the movie.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Great Doc about rock and roll and the music business.  The scenes with Paul McCartney were awesome!  I definitely recommend this doc.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is an ok game to play to kill time. the graphics are decent... it is hard to catch scrat though... he is a quick bugger...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|l love this game.  It makes you think which is the best part.  Can't wait for more rooms and more great options!!!!!!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Enjoyment of any book is based on the readers ability to immerse himself into the story and use the authors story line to feel what he intended for you know about his creative  characters.
B007H7XRLI|5.0|Henry Cavill is seriously one of the hottest men on the plantet. What more could anyone want? Oh, good storyline, action scenes and whatnot as well. lol
B00CH87HF4|5.0|greatest game for my kindle I have found to date. Dungeon hunter 4 exceeds my expectations. five star rating from Derp
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I was drawn into this book from the start. Worth a read for sure. An interesting look at life for an orphan in that time.
B007RGAC7G|5.0|product was exactly as described and shipped really fast for a verry low cost.<br /><br />i recommend if you are wondering about the book get it here.
B00005Y228|3.0|At the height of this release it was considered a good piece of music. Overal it will keep energy going if you are having a gathering or party.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great series! I have been captured since I first started watching. And David Tennant is the best. How could you o wrong.
B00026W82U|4.0|I found that this album is a nice surprise. I found that this band to have a unique sense of themselves and their music. Very nice. Worth a listen.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A very good read, hard to put down.  Seriously missed many of the story's characters in this volume and can't wait to catch up with them in book 5 \\"A Dance of Dragons.\\"
B00070Q7VO|3.0|I bought this CD thinking it would have a little more to it. It is okay to me. Not really impressed.
0143123173|5.0|Craig Johnson is one of the great storytellers of today. A must read. If you like 'Longmire' the TV show, the books are a must....enjoy!
B0006399FS|5.0|The album is great. I will not say one of the best, but if you are a true fan you will always find the music enjoyable.
B00CMEQD30|3.0|I liked the first, I dunno, 80%, with an interesting world and two characters that were different but complementary. The tasks were creative and the stakes seemed high. But the ending was a little too much talking-the-problem-to-death and just felt like cumbersome walls of lecturing text, only to then feel oddly rushed. Which seemed a shame, as, again, up until then it was a fun read.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|We LOVE the Phantom of the Opera, and were not disappointed by this movie.  They did a really good job on the entire presentation.  Beautiful setting and thoughtful presentation of facts you know, but some were presented in a different way while staying true to the story. Nothing beats seeing it live with a great cast, but this will definitely give you a Phantom 'fix' until a production returns to your area.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|A classic comedy looking at the stars of sci-fi shows. I really wonder how Mr. Shatner deals with his success.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was a good movie, but cannot compare it to the book as I have not read it. Good entertainment.
B00CRW2066|5.0|Having only recently heard of The National and discovering the album was on sale, I decided to pick it up. I'm not disappointed in the least! Some of these songs induce emotions similar to those I remember having while listening to Coldplay's A Rush of Blood to the Head back in 2003-04. That band just had a way with digging deep into my soul and bringing forth all kinds of hearty feels, at least at that time. There's no way Coldplay's current music will bring me back there, so I'm thinking Trouble Will Find Me might be my A Rush of Blood to the Head for 2013 and beyond. I'm looking forward to finding out!
0575096624|1.0|This book was a disappointment. As a last installment of the series, I saw the ending coming from a mile down the road. I also personally didn't agree with who Sookie ended up with. I felt like there were many holes in the story and her relationship with Eric ended abruptly and without clear explanation. The author did not make this sound like a fling in the beginning of the relationship but tried to pass it off as one in this last installment. This book just didn't have the fun feeling of the other books.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The foster kid storyline  was something that I was not expecting. That said, it made for an interesting read and fasinating character development. This story was incredibly emotional.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|I read many reviews on this book before purchasing it.  All were top ratings - with rave reviews.  I wouldn't give it rave reviews, but it was okay.  The author has a sort of depressing outlook on life.  Most of the stories were sad or depressing, which wasn't what I expected.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Adds versatility to your amazingly capable Hero 3 by letting you shoot pictures in the normal point-and-shoot mode. Not suitable for underwater use (10' max) and the image can wash out in very bright conditions.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Addictively fun! Takes so (read: lots) of practice to go further into the game but worth it. Does heat up my Kindle though.
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|This game was great until, after reaching level 18, it started back over at level one! All of my progress was lost. Will be uninstalling!!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|very readable...not just a self help book but i still fail to grasp exactly who cares about this subject...if half of us are extroverts, and half introverts masking our quiet selves with extrovert mannerisms in order to acjieve in an extrovert world...well..so what? We introverts are aware of our powers.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|It froze at the log in screen. So I exited the app, and it didn't even load the app it went black. Tried that about three times until reinstalling it again, and the same thing happened. Don't get it.
0321934318|5.0|If you are new to Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, or are thinking of upgrading from an earlier version, then this is the book for you. Well written, in a concise voice that is easy to follow, and full of examples. Written by Scott Kelby, he explains how to use the software and later, it will become a good reference manual. Recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the software and not struggle with it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The main statement I can make is that the books makes you want to keep reading.  There are twists and turns that keep you totally interested.  I was not pleased with the ending.
B0038AUY96|5.0|If you like thrillers this is one of the best but gory. Jo Nesbo keeps up the standard of Scandinavian crime writers.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was truly entertaining.  Wonderful storytelling with fantastic visual descriptions. I couldn't wait to read it every night.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This is very readable but gets silly. But it is a very good laugh and parts of it are LOL.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Solid performance from everyone ... Go back and watch the 1974 classic and you'll see they just polished up an old gold coin. Very well done.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Kids totally had a ball building it. Lots of nice features and the window curtains were so cute. All in all it was a great present
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|IT WAS NEW AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT. THE PICTURE WAS CLEAR. MY HUSBAND AND I ENJOYED THE MOVIE VERY MUCH.
B00628RVV0|5.0|This film gave insight to the innocents of children, whether Jew or (in the case of this film) Catholic. Clearly, we see that (at first), not all the German citizens were aware of the Nazi plan. Even if the German/European non-Jew citizen had known, what could they have done to stop Hitler's Final Solution?  The father's intensified hatred toward the Jews moved forward with such chaotic speed, he could never have known its impactful devastation, unless, of course, it was to jackknife into his own family.
1401300529|5.0|Long but great.  Gives an understanding of the political and military performance of the big names, while the poor grunts died when they would not have with better and more intelligent leadership.  Highly recommended from an ex infantryman.
B00BB8VRPM|1.0|I think I must have ordered the wrong movie. I watched the first 5 minutes of it, then deleted it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Existing colourful addictive five star played the original game for years I find its great for brain flexing get it you will thank me
0756404738|5.0|Second book of the best ongoing fantasy trilogy. Actually Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear are like drugs. Once I sit down to read, I only stop when I'm too tired to read more. I'm eagerly awaiting the last book. Nothing to add really. Read it yourself or read another review by someone who knows how to write one. I'm just the random guy passing through.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|We were quite disappointed at the animated Disneylike settings .  I thought it was going to break out into a musical.<br />Leonardo played his role very good, as he always does.  He did not have much to work with!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Just a fun game. Tough to keep enough bingo credits and money without. Spending your own money.  Could get expensive.
034580709X|5.0|Love the detective Harry Hole.  Jo is one of those writers who slowly draws you in and makes you turn the page.
B005KR6OB2|5.0|the set was all i expected it to be. my mom and i love the boys and watch at least one or two shows daily.
B000KIPT30|5.0|If you need a 4 output headphone mixer and don't want to pay more than 20 bucks... Buy this.<br />I output from a Focusrite Saffire Pro 40 interface and notice no loss in audio quality. I bought this for tracking multiple people in my studio.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Tom C. is one of the best action stars there is today. Oblivion is just that! Who would have thought that ending. Brilliant
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Excellent. This book is a very enjoyable read. The characters are interesting, funny. I loved the goddesses and the humanizing of the celtic pantheon.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|A broken character who comes alive again in Nesbo's Harry Hole series. These are great novels, the only distraction is trying to figure out names and places in Norway. Good story, great plot, wonderful character development. Another homerun for Jo Nesbo.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|My husband and I thought we'd check this movie out based on the trailers that we had seen.  Many of the espionage/action films get to be pretty predictable after awhile so we were skeptical as to whether this would be different.  It was good to the very end.  And, Tom Cruise did not disappoint--he seems to continue to handle all this action and movement just fine.
B000I9X668|5.0|This is a classic. It is timeless for those of us who live in cubicles. What else more can I say?
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book refocuses each one of us on a journey of a personal quest to find the best in each of us
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Awesome book. Ready for the next ! Helps those relate who have tortured pasts. Love is possible for everyone !
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The Good Wife has many stories going at once. I like how they intertwine the cast with one another. Three is also a lot of humor which lightens some of the drama.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Khan was not as smooth as the original<br />Recardo Mountelbaan. Not sure of the spelling😃 but I did enjoy the show
B007VYAJAE|5.0|The best documentary of the king of reggae. We love you Bob Marley we listen to you every day. WE MISS YOU...ONE LOVE..
0307271609|5.0|Empress Cixi is nearly a mirror opposite of Lady Wu. Both ruled China as regents for their sons.<br />Lady Wu(not in this book) centuries earlier seized power for selfish ends. Mostly, power, sex and parties. But absolute power did not corrupt her, as she was already plenty corrupt. Her power grab ended with her executed for wild eyed crimes, and a new dynasty taking over, making it impossible for women to have any role in China.<br />Concubine Cixi, through trickery, pulled off a joint power grab on her husband's death. Higher ranking actual Empress Zhen, happily let less educated Cixi take the more active role in their joint rule.<br />Unlike Lady Wu, Cixi actually ran the country for the good of the people.  Seeing the easy to learn lessons her husband and his councilors missed, she got along with foreign nations and started trade and importing technology. And extra food when famines or floods came. Many Chinese hated this.<br />She retired and the improvements stopped under her short lived work and book hating playboy son. After his death, although they hated modernization and working with foreigners, they loved the fact that Cixi had doubled the nation's wealth, so the imperial council coaxed her out of retirement. To do insane ideas like trains and telegraphs. With minimum bloodshed of the anti-progress crowd. Even increasing China to its present boundaries.<br />This ended when her adopted son came of age, Cixi retired, and Co-Empress Zhen died.  The new emperor was a bad choice in the opposite direction. A classic scholar supreme, studying and reading Confucius all the time, his idea of helping the starving in a famine was writing them a poem of how sad their dying of hunger made him feel.<br />The Japanese saw how China had let the army and navy fall apart, and invaded Korea, a client kingdom.  When the war was 90% lost, Cixi was given - not exactly command, but enough power that she was branded the war's loser, and for not wanting the treaty, blamed for the horrible peace treaty.<br />However the council ditched the Emperor for Cixi. She made friends with Russia, getting them to build a shortcut of the Trans-Siberian Railroad through northern China, saving them a longer route and netting her a nearly free railroad.<br />After two years of real retirement by Cixi, the emperor started doing real reforms under the guidance of a conman, who had great reform ideas. Except for the part about killing Cixi, and replacing the entire government with his cronies. The plot uncovered and undone, Cixi had to put her foster son under house arrest to prevent him from being exposed as involved in the plot. And adopt a new imperial son.<br />This would have worked if not for the anti-Christian, anti-foreigner Boxer Rebellion. Cixi survived it, and really jacked up the reforms.  Only to fail in the end as the reforms came too late.<br />If you like historical detail, this book is loaded with it.  (Brick beds, even!)  Plenty of photographs. Never a dull moment, with invasions, plots, and riots after plots, rebellions and wars.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|Neil Young always delivers.  Love his voice and this CD is different than his past work...nice addition to my CD collection.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I love all of the actors in this movie. The music is peppy and the dancing is great. I watched it on TV so many times, that I bought it and still find it enjoyable.  Christina is so cute in it, and I think she's a good little actress.
0316098329|4.0|This book leaves you unnerved that a man could actually get away with this type of human bondage. It was so real that it was frightening. A great read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|having pinterest on the kindle fire hd just lets me be even more distracted by making boards instead of lists. XD
B008469DGY|5.0|Just a fun game. Easy to play with good graphics. No problems loading and it runs great. Mindless entertainment. I'd recommend it to everyone.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|using fb on my kindle fire hd allows me to be in touch with friends and especially family in more places...until i finally give in to using a smart phone.  lol
B004X6PRO6|5.0|It was intriguing to read a novel placed in a place we know so little about and the effect of the culture on the individual. this is one of my new favorite books.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|Just a great classic movie of good vs evil, but I won't say who wins in case you haven't seen it.
B005S9EJ14|2.0|ok movie has its moments. The cast is better than the movie. Not the best writing. Some people may enjoy this
B0054PSY2W|5.0|Just what the wife wanted, of course I loved it, and it's a good movie in the collection and it's bluray
B007A2O3FO|3.0|If you like maggie smith this movie is worth watching. It is totally appropriate for all ages, good overall  movie
B004XZR63M|5.0|This should be the primer for all parents to give to their children in some form, whether the board game or the book this book will make you feel completely ignorant and hopeless one moment and full of hope the next...exhilarating!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun, easy but not to easy, haven't spent any real money on it so far so so far so good.
0920668372|5.0|Does what it's supposed to do
B002RVCD6O|5.0|I downloaded this movie from Amazon to watch on my Wii.  I was very easy to do and the quality was great.  I would recommend doing this!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Rovio has outdone themselves again it is way better than angry birds it requires physics to play. GET THE APP ITS WORTH THE DOWNLOAD TIME.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|When I love this game is a few days later in the method to hack the king of saints I love this game I just love it it's a finding game that's cool
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This book was such an amazing, hair raising, nail biting book!! Every time I tried to stop reading I couldn't be cause I was hooked in! This book is a very good book and it shows how people would treat you differently when you gain knowledge! Definitely a must read! Completed changed my perspective of Gods special children.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Each song flows into the other better than most greatest hits albums. One continuous love session! Sets the mood perfectly.
B00E88YNJY|5.0|This is a great WHOLE album purchase, because style varies as you listen to each track. If you like rock, folk, bluegrass, or country...my guess is you will REALLY enjoy this!
0743487486|5.0|A great read for any parent that wants to raise a child different from the normal habits of punishment, conditional love, and over praise. Let's do something right for the next generation!
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Farfetched, futuristic, and at times a little poignant. Big Hugh Jackman fan and also a fan of his lesser appreciated stuff (Van Helsing...anybody?).  CGI was great and plot subtext was nicely filled in. Love the &#34;everyman&#34; hero theme that enables all viewers to be vicariously larger than life for a couple of hours. Take off your reality goggles for a while and have fun.
B004X80QNG|1.0|OK, so gave it a try, but the app you get doesn't match the screenshots, the interface is very \\"clunky\\" compared to modern Android apps and it seems to be limited to just being a calendar.  Google Calendar is much better and is always free.  Run away - don't load this on your device.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Moved a bit slow at times, but overall an okay movie. Tom Cruise needs to &#34;find his mojo&#34; again. His movies used to be consistently better.  Morgan Freeman's part is fairly small, but he is such a titan that his mere presence really shores up this show. Worth the Amazon rental price, but glad I didn't pay for a theater ticket.
B003N0XDT4|2.0|It's actually only be used on a pc. It is not for a portable headphone. I returned it and got FiiO E11 instead.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Great acting and a good story.Not much more to say about this movie. It was very entertaining.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|This is a great dice game--lots of fun for your favorite zombie apocalypse warrior! Roll brains for you to &#34;eat&#34; (yeah, I know) and avoid shotgun blasts or you'll get SHOTGUNNED! A fun twist on lots of old favorites.
B004V43ZQC|3.0|This book is a collection of long and short stories with a common thread, be it a mention of Noah and his Ark (the subject of the first story), voyaging on a boat or a cruise ship or a canoe, climbing mountains, or stowing away as a &#34;wood worm&#34; (termite) which -like the cockroach- will survive any destruction on earth. Some of the stories were interesting, some boring, most humorous with a touch of sarcasm. This perspective on history will make the reader think outside the proverbial box of learning.
B009MJU52I|4.0|I've always loved animal figurines, and this Schleich peacock really caught my eye. In full, glorious spread this toy shows the beautiful colors of the male's plumage. A great for little collectors, or not so little!

1434441636|5.0|I haven't read this book since high school and I also lost that copy, so I wanted to have it for my home library. I liked that even I have purchased a used copy it was in great shape like new. Also it arrived in few days. Great deal.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|The movie was very unpredictable.  I really thought that he was really a part of what I was seeing on the screen.<br />I turns out that it was all in his mind. This story was very well told.<br />This is a must see film.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This is a very good movie, I would recommend it for all ages. I liked how it brought the story all together.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A book has to capture my attention immediately or I will not continue reading it.  This is the first book that I have read start to finish in at least 15 years.  I am ready to start the next one!

B005DJREGQ|5.0|This was so funny and dramatic I thought I wouldn't like it but ended up loving it! I could not stop at Season 1. I could not resist and watch Season 2.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Kate Morton keeps the reader enthralled throughout her books! There's always a secret that keeps the suspense alive. And the history is great!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|It was very true to the book. I loved how Leonardo depicted gatsby. The soundtrack is also very good. I was impressed.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Kate Morton has a wonderful way to keep her novels full of suspense and surprise! They are wonderful historical reads!
B000QCQ970|5.0|The author has explored basic truths of learning, preparation and world class competitive performance that apply to diverse disciplines. This is an inspiration and a great read!
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Kate Morton has a secret! It's the secrets she puts in her novels that make them &#34;page turners&#34;! And I love the historical read!
B00013M6NK|5.0|It works a I expected.<br />It's a good idea to have at least two batteries with you when do long trips and take a lot of photos.
B008469DGY|5.0|Fun to play, nice, clear, HD graphics. Many levels. Challenging yet simple enough rules like sudoku and angry birds!  :-)
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse doesn't feel as good as a $100+ Razer mouse, honestly. But this isn't a $100 mouse, this is a $40 mouse. I would highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to put out too much money or who is just getting into gaming, all of the buttons work great and the huge range of DPI settings in addition to the weights make it very customizable to how you want it.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This is one of my favorite series of all times. Every episode is wonderful. I truly laugh so hard I cry almost every episode.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Unfortunately I'm forced to read all 3 books. Once you start one it's almost impossible not to keep going. Th  writing is terrible but the story draws you in.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Great great great!!!!  What can I say if you watched the show you know this is a very interesting, smart, exiting show, that is worth watching over and over. The effects are great, the story is very well elaborated and the character development keeps you coming for more!!!!! And  even makes you sad to see some of them die, because you grow attached to them in some ways...
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This was a well written fast paced account of an adult with Aspergers Disease, before it was a recognised disease. The characters were well written and I could recognise several several aspects in my friends. I laughed out loud reading this, it was a great change from some of the heavier books I have read lately and will give hope to pares of Aspies children if they can guide them to adulthood.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This TV show is getting me through some long workouts on the bike and elypitcal. For the first time, I am looking forward to workouts!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|This was an interesting, easy to read account of the lives of Afganees, and refugees. The characters were well formed, believable and gave me a more compassionate view of the deprivations that  of living in that area.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have had alot of alarm apps...and there were a couple of times they didnt go off...but this alarm ALWAYS goes off! i love it, there are fun ways to set snooze such as shaking the device and even solving math problems...it is a MUST get..enjoy:)
B00AFEXRME|5.0|My son, who has been in recovery for 14 months, absolutely related to this movie. He showed it to his other friends in recovery. Great movie, very emotional to anyone who has been affected by addiction
B00338QF0U|5.0|I can't imagine how William Boyd could be considered other than one of the finest writers in the business today. His plots are well conceived, his research meticulous and, most important, his characters literally live and breathe before the reader. I've read all of his books that have become Kindles and I would be hard pressed to name one of his books as his best but clearly there is nothing ordinary about Ordinary Thunderstorms.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love Nemo`s reef it's a cute addictive game I play it nonstop all day everyday since I found it I would recommend it to everyone I know
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have been looking for this game for a long time now and I finally found it. Thanks for all the good times. Looking forward to more of these kinds of entertainment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addictive. If you like mind puzzles you will LOVE this. Once you solve the harder levels you will think you are Patrick Jane from CBS's show &quot;The Mentalist&quot;
B00DVXVMT6|5.0|This CD is amazing, the lyrics are powerful and the percussion is out of this world.  By far their best work yet.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This is all you need in a mail app to check and compose mail in Yahoo.  You should try this yourself.
B005QYKD4I|3.0|Never been a huge fan of Michael Bay's treatment of the Transformer canon.  The action is cool, but all the 'extra metal' on the characters seems too busy and detracts.  I see the attempt to give facial expressions to the Transformers, but it just doesn't come off as clean.  Decent story, started off good with the whole Apollo 11 cover-up, but quickly devolved into nothingness.  Very disappointed with the Shockwave treatment too.  Not sure what the heck that pet digger-worm-whatsits was supposed to be...<br /><br />Shia LeBeouf was over the top as well, and kind of annoying.  Sorry to see Patrick Dempsey in this one, really like him as an actor, and he typically makes good decisions, this wasn't a necessarily bad one, but I can't believe he didn't have other (better) offers.<br /><br />I did like the fact that Megatron (along with Sentinel Prime) were killed off.  Here's to hoping that the next movie will be a reboot.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Was introduced to this game by a visiting nephew and had to order it!  Really fun and super easy to learn.  My husband and I play for two out of three wins every night.  This would be a terrific game for a family as even the younger members will catch on quickly.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Looks OK, clear, easy to use (large) buttons, does what it promises to do, handy especially when on the move.
B00CWVGNS8|5.0|The movie is a well-written film that can stand alone by itself but is more poignant if viewed as a sequel to &#34;Yossi and Jagger&#34;.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Better than the inbuilt browser on my Kindle, but it's just Google lite, there isn't much more to say about it
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|This song really gets you at the end. After sitting for two hours and 10 minutes, watching the movie, this song was implanted into my head. I do like it very much. Pleasant surprise to see it was from M83.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Easy to play version of a fun game. Instructions are clear, better to use on a tablet than on a phone as the screen is bigger.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 6 yr old an  I had so much fun playing this together!  Bummed we completed all th  levels, we want more!!!  Would totally pay to get this extended version of this app!!
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This was a very different Zombie movie, the zombies think talk and crush on girls. Very different, it was cute I would watch it again.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I primarily use these when I go work out at the YMCA, for watching the TV's to distract me from the fact that I am exercising. They're comfortable enough and stay put. I really dislike the ear bud style headphones, so I am happy that these exist as an alternative. I have been using them probably 3-4 times a week for about a year and they've held up. I just throw them in my backpack which gets thrown around and abused (we also use it as a diaper bag during the week).<br /><br />They don't give the absolute greatest sound quality, but for watching TV while working out I think they do the job. Considering their price and their durability I am very happy with them.
B00009UTQD|5.0|Use it to transport filters.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Fits 77mm filter size comfortably.<br />Has velcro and &#34;snaps&#34; - can be attached to belt or camera bag.<br />Has cushioned dividers.<br /><br />Con's:<br />Would have liked to see a cleaning cloth compartment.<br />Would have liked to see the ability to label the compartments, (so that I don't need to lift each one up, to find the one I'm looking for.)<br /><br />I would recommend it to a friend.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|saw this move at the drive in with a double feature along with the conjuring, I didn't expect much from it, thought it would be just another average comedy that comes and goes. but OMG I laughed so many times, the story is predictable, but this movie is really good. I pretty much never laugh watching anything, ever, unless its tosh.0 and only rarely then. but this movies made me laugh. I bust out when they were playing charades and the boy drew the big black 'skateboard'. lmfao. cant wait til this comes out on dvd, I will def be pre ordering it.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|As with anything Donald Fagan does, it has a terrific production behind it.  The songs, however, seem to simply be reruns of his other albums.  Most songs tend to have the same feel, giving this effort the idea that the whole thing is one, long song.  This was purchased from a glowing review and, liking Fagan and, of course, Steely Dan, seemed to be something that should be added to the CD stockpile.  I'd hoped for a &#34;Nightfly&#34; type of CD that you marvel at but sadly, it was/is just another rehash of similar feeling songs from past work.
0091922348|5.0|Absolutely love this cookbook.  The recipes are delicious and I have probably used this book more than any cookbook on my shelf. The recipes are perfect for outdoor and casual entertaining as most of them are served at room temperature. A must buy if you like barbeque/casual entertaining.
B003Y5USF0|4.0|I am a huge fan of this movie! The graphics still hold up well and there is actually a plot line! I would have rated it five stars, but there was quite a bit of the &#34;S-word&#34;, a reference to a male body part, and the Lord's name taken in vain; making it uncomfortable for family viewing. On the up side there was no nudity or sex. Hope this is helpful to someone!
B0081336FO|5.0|Everything about it was fantastic. This just keeps getting better and better. The acting is superb and the stories are wonderful
B00340ESIS|5.0|This is a MUST READ for all screenwriters. However, it is just one of many books you should have in your screenwriting library.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Just tried this out and it seemed like it was going to do the job for me (I don't care about snyching to the Google Calendar). My big thing was that it needs to work offline, and it seems that it does. However, when I tried to add a contact,it promptly crashed.  When I went back into the app, I received a warning that the \\"disappearing PI Accounts problem has been fixed, and is available as a separate download from the [Google] Play store.\\"<br /><br />Being a (non-hacked) Kindle user, this doesn't help the \\"disappearing PI Accounts\\" problem for me, so I promptly deleted and will be looking for another app.  Free (today) or not, unexpected wipes are not what I'm looking for, and if you're not providing support for ALL of your customers, then there's no reason for me to stick around.
B002V9PEU4|4.0|Its the kid! He ruins it! Not the actors fault, actually, but the writers and director. Ijnstead of being totally excited about getting a private screened sneek preview of his favorite hero's new sequel, he acts bored and barely interested.<br />Still a great movie with a fascinating concept, excellent action, lots of humor and, not that anybody noticed, GOOD ACTING!<br /><br />The blue ray finally brings us a rendition worth watching. as others have mentioned, the original DVD pan & scan totally sucked. The BR is sharp, clear and of course the complete picture.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Shame it only went one season. Fault belongs with the network that aired it out of order and didn't promote it correctly. Show had the potential to run for years.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of the 'Dead series and as with all remakes I was very skeptical but this was actually damn good.  I still wish Bruce Campbell would have made an appearance though.
B008469DGY|4.0|fun game to keep me entertained at work I find that sometime the spin can be very hard to control.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|Everything that you have ever LOVED in the incredible DIE HARD series has been completely removed and / or diluted out of this movie.<br />PLEASE, please please, please, please, PLEASE, please just DO NOT watch this movie. It will really ruin the solid respect you probably have for the series and will most likely make you want to vomit.<br />I am trying not to vomit right now as I write this.<br /><br />I am very disappointed and am honestly trying to save as many people as I can.<br /><br />Please go rent one of the originals.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read all three in a couple of days.  Although the first two were better than the last one, I enjoyed these books.  If I had known what the story-line was, I would have never started to read them.  So glad I did.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like to play before getting ready for bed, or just to sit and play when I have some down time.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I fully enjoyed the movie and kept me going from beginning to end.  Could  watch it again and not get bored.  My kind of movie!!!!!!!!
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|I cannot emphasize enough have much I enjoyed this book.  Quite simply, \\"Weissenteiners\\" left me breathless, in awe and a little emotionally drained.<br /><br />What begins as a love story quickly turns into a horrific depiction of pre WW2 Germany and the rise of Antisemitism<br /><br />I have studied this period in time and researched Nazi Germany pre World Ward 2 and this author had his historical facts spot on, the descriptions, the setting and the accuracy astounded me.  What he added for me was the emotional turmoil and the anguish felt by ordinary people, innocent people, caught up in brutal lust for power that overran Germany.<br /><br />It is though, not a history book, it is a novel, a story and a brilliant story at that - a tale of love, mental anguish and more importantly - the human psyche.<br />This book stands alone as one the best books I have read in a long time.<br />And while genocide, ethnic cleansing still occurs, 80 years later and history repeats itself - this book promoted emotions that made me think \\"has nothing changed\\".<br />A great read, a great story and highly recommended.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|this game is almost flawless except for the noobs that I sometimes find on servers.. other than that really fun and addicting game!!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie had me fooled from the beginning! You're constantly trying to figure out what is going on, and then they throw another twist at you! The ending was not what I expected at all- in a good way. The graphics were also spectacular- it looked so real! If you like science fiction/mystery/thriller, this is for you.This was the best movie I've seen in a very, very long time. I only wish that I would've bought it in the first place, rather than rented it.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|love this movie and owning it now is a treat. i can watch this over and over and i am excited to check out all the special features included.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have always owned an updated Apple TV for the last 10 years and I really love it.  However, I thought I would take the opportunity to purchase the Google Chromcast HDMI Streaming Media Player and see how it works.  I did not see any functional differences beween the two platforms (Apple verses Google).  Each of the above-mentioned units (Apple TV and Google Chromcast) literally provide some of the same identical functionality and benefits..  Both can stream, provide access to the Internet,  YouTube, etc... I don't own an Adroid phone, but I was able to use both my iPhone 5 and iPad - 4th generation to stream movies and music.  I think this might be a great fit for an Android user who is looking for most of the functionality already built into the Apple TV.  But I still love my Apple TV better.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I enjoy this series never thought I would but once I started I was hooked. I cant wait for January and season #4!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|There isn't a Nicholas Sparks book I've read that I didn't like. I love the movies too and I can't wait to see this one on the big screen.
B00EVU3S4U|3.0|***2 1/2 stars***  FOR POORLY PLACED CASTING OF TWO TERRIFIC STARS IN A REMAKE THAT FALLS SHORT OF THE ORIGINAL<br /><br />I love both Rachel McAdams and Noomi Rapace in their many films, but I feel perhaps they were not used correctly here (I will explain below). Most Americans viewing this film will assume it's an original work if they haven't seen the previous French movie [[ASIN:B006OQDIOE Love Crime]] (Crime D'Amour). In fact, Passion is a very close copy of the superior French film staring Kristin Scott Thomas and Ludivine Sagnier.<br /><br />McAdams doesn't have as much the look of power and authority required for a manipulative business executive (too young) and Noomi Rapace struggles trying to be the innocent, young ing&eacute;nue up-and-comer in the company (she has the harder street smart look).  Actually, if they just switched rolls I think Noomi could have projected the slightly more mature authority figure while Mcadams could be the young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Where the French version builds the mystery within a mystery - piece by meticulous piece, the suspense mechanisms in this film come across trite and perfunctory by comparison. If you only watch the US version, you may find it a passable mystery at best unless you are a die hard De Palma fan. Additionally, I didn't find the chemistry between McAdams and Rapace that convincing and the movie as a whole just wasn't that sexy, particularly for the R rating and hype surrounding the film.<br /><br />THE PLOT (No spoilers): A rising female advertising executive uses the romantic infatuation of her bright young female assistant to manipulate her into giving ideas, which she steals to promote her own career.  Further, she then humiliates the assistant once she has what she wants. The assistant is more than just a bright study with a penchant for powerful women. Needless to say, things take a dark turn for several of the characters involved. This is a little simplistic since both movies try to project more allegorical meanings while plumbing deep emotional and psychological depths. However, I don't wish to give any spoilers so I will leave it at that. There are also plot divergences between the two movies as they deal with the later half of the film and I found the previous French version more satisfying in that respect as well.<br /><br />I would not call the French version a masterpiece, but it has great depth, meticulous construction of the crime, suspense, and believable sapphic infatuation. Ludivine Sagnier is far more sexy and believable as the naïve assistant that is initially manipulated in the affair.<br /><br />De Palma fans will want to see this movie and may even appreciate it greatly. For other viewers it's probably a mixed bag.nal and psychological depths. However, I don't wish to give any spoilers so I will leave it at that.

B0073Q0DZG|4.0|I bought this for my step-dad as a birthday gift. He is very much a birder and loved the movie! :)
B004LUS390|5.0|I am in love with this application. I originally bought it on my phone and created a few awesome works of art and decided that I will never own a phone or tablet without this application installed. Perfect.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find this app convenient, easy to use and on top of that, it's free.  Try it out, I think you'll like it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|AN old story brought up to date. Well acted and good script. Engaging, intriguing and entertaining. Better than the new American version.
B0017TFLBQ|1.0|I ordered this product in late July, they said it would arrive between Mid-Late August, okay, I can wait a month, it is now early September, and I come looking for my product to find that my money has been refunded, now I would have no problem with this if I had gotten an email explaining why and that my money has been refunded, however instead, in mid-August I get an email from Amazon asking how I like my product, makes me think it should be in my mail box, and it isn't I don't reply or do anything thinking there are still a few days left to receive it. I am mad and saddened that I can't play one of my favorite time wasting games. I guess I am just not destined to play or as my fiance says \\"The game just doesn't exist\\" Thank you Amazon and Harley whatever company for making me mad and frustrated after a month and a half of waiting.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Saw this in theaters first.  Had to buy once it was on DVD.  Daniel day Lewis is amazing as always.
B000089RV6|5.0|Yes indeed, the boys from Australia really get the job done with this Masterpiece.  Back In Black is like a Rock and Roll Heart Attack.  For those out there that are Fans you will know what I mean.  Wow..........Rocked my whole being.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is pretty wicked. It has helped me so much with my homework and basically whenever I need a definition. I especially like the horoscopes and the thesaurus. I use the thesaurus to find transition words. Haha.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved the way many lives were connected with each other and how fate worked in mysterious ways. An excellent read.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|I love Zafon, and I could oh repeat it a thousand times but you would probably get tired of it. The Prisoner of Heaven takes you back to everything we have learned about Martin in The Angel's Game and turns it all around. Absolutely fantastic, obviously.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Considering this is my second purchase of this album, yes, I'd recommend it.  The first one got worn out and damaged over the years so this worked as a great replacement.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Try it!!!! It is an addiction you won't be able to put down. No matter how old you are it's fun!
B004VPAXHU|5.0|This is a must listen. Bold, unique, atmospheric, emotional. I could go on. Let's just say it delivers on all levels. Kate is an amazing talent and this is a testament to her creativity and vision. There is no other female artist as gifted as Kate Bush and that is the truth.
B000002KNY|5.0|It brings me back to the past when the Talking Heads were very popular. I love this band and what they mean to music.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|This is Denzel at his best. This one is right up there with Training Day. If you like Denzel you will love this one.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Mom asked for this for Christmas.  I had it shipped to my brother AJ's apt. so he could wrap and bring it to her. He asked if he could unwrap it and watch it first and I said \\"not really, it's a gift\\".  Mom called and when I told her I shipped her present to AJ to wrap, she said \\"thank you, I watched it and it's great\\".  I told her \\"but it was a present, you were supposed to wait til Christmas\\" and she replied \\"oh so you DID get me Fawlty Towers for Christmas!\\".  What a sneaky, devious little trick she played on me to find out what her gift was. So I told AJ to could go ahead and unwrap it and watch it.  HA!
B005LAIGNC|2.0|I got this film out of respect for the Airmen and because I though it would be a great film. Boy was I wrong! Its Snoopy meets the Red Barron. Don't wast your money.
034544678X|5.0|I've read a lot of \\"dog books\\" focusing on training your dog. This book really gives the reader/owner a glimpse of dog/human relations from a dog's perspective. We have to recognize we aren't 2 legged dogs, nor dogs hairy humans, and the author uses understanding to this help us shape our actions and reactions to make them more readable to our dogs.<br />As others have noted, this is NOT a systematic book on dog training. I read it through once, putting post it notes on the margins of pages I found particularly helpful and then re-read it, focusing on these sections.<br />This book has helped me with my dog, and importantly, other dogs I meet on walks and group settings.
B0017HMF6W|4.0|Even after all these years it is still one of the best films made. Be sure to watch the extras lots of fun and interesting things there.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun game. Wish you. Would customize horse more. But it's still entertaining. Would recommend for any horse lover or even an in animal lover to be honest.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Its a very good story with good twists. I would have liked a better understanding of what the resistance was doing all this time on earth. And they should have given Morgan Freeman a much bigger role.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|This movie had a very believable plot. It had an ending that I thought was not expected. I didnt predict this.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This was one of the first games my mother taught me to play. When she was busy and wanted to finish quickly, she would sit me down with a deck of cards and she wouldn't hear from me until she came to tell me it was time to go home. The time would pass so quickly &amp; I knew that when we got home, my mom would spend time playing with me. She's no longer with us but whenever I sit down to play a game, I feel just like she's just in the next room.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book.  It is such a beautiful story of love.  The characters were funny and genuine.  This book made me laugh out loud and while I never cry at books or movies I actually teared up.  I read it in one day.  I couldn't put it down.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was just as great as it was when I saw it in the theater, and the bonus disc was full of info and extra footage.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|The characters full develop in the second season and the drama really picks up. The historic aspects of the show are also really interesting.
0062080237|3.0|MINI REVIEW: it's an intriguing idea. What if gods of all legends existed but their powers were based on mortal worship of them? As a result certain gods immigrated to America with their people. Other gods became so forgotten that they're almost mortals in America who live forever.<br /><br />The writing style was mildly to moderately engaging. This was a novel better for its ideas than execution typically though it did have some great scenes. That said, it's a very long novel so it does tend to drag.<br /><br />It just backs up my opinion that until ANANSI BOYS Gaiman wasn't that great at novel execution and I'm still of the opinion that he had people \\"helping\\" him with the plotting of the SANDMAN graphic novels.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: B minus.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just like computer game with swipe functionality. No suprises here, if you like solitare on the PC you'll like it here.
B003VANOFY|2.0|The actual sound quality and fit of the headphones are just fine, but the problems start with them being wireless.  The battery life is pretty short, 5 or maybe 6 hours, nowhere near the 10 advertised. The software telling you how many hours of charge is completely unreliable.<br /><br />The most frustrating aspect by far is the fact that the wireless signal is on the same frequency as wireless routers, etc. and the headset will constantly reset or shut itself off when my wifi is on. To even be usable I have to turn off the wireless broadcast on my router. Luckily I'm hard-plugged in, but still, kind of ridiculous. Logitech apparently don't care. Google these things and they've had issues with battery life, charging, and signal strength for years without Logitech doing anything about it.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'm never buying a wireless headset again. It's not worth the headaches.
B00B89LZ4C|3.0|Ordered this as a gift for my husband, who collects toys and is a big fan of the show.  The first shipment was in an envelope and the box was damaged and the plastic casing was not attached to the cardboard.  I exchanged it for a new one and this time it arrived in a box, so I thought it wouldn't be damaged, but it was in the same condition.  I think the manufacturer must use glue that doesn't last or adhere properly.  Just wanted to advise any collectors out there of the issue.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It has it's small little bugs but over all I find myself really enjoying playing this game. It can be pretty repetitive with the minigames but I like how it retells the G4 MLP story through out the game play. Also they added a lot of extra things like derpy and a lot of background ponies, so in short it made me want to progress in the game just to unlock some of my favorite ponies. I play on a kindle fire and it works fine. I have the first generation of it so it acts up from time to time but nothing enough to really get mad at. Over all a real decent game to help waste some time.
B00516G6ME|5.0|if you one piece fan you must get this figure pre -order it now don't wait  start your order now
B00E978FGQ|2.0|I thought we were really heading somewhere for the first third of the movie and then the holes in the plot started getting bigger and BIGGER until all of the fun just vanished into a puff of chase scenes and exploding cars. What a pity.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|It is a little slow.  I love David Tennant.  The characters are wonderful.  I still can figure out who the guilty party is, quite a few are guilty of something.
0783230079|2.0|it had a bad crack,and stopped in certain places,which caused it to skip as well.it's a wonderful movie but that happening really ruined it for me
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Interesting, intriguing, captivating, surprising, no words can describe the feeling you get when you read this. Great twist of words. I love it. Amazing for teens.
B003D513TQ|5.0|Emily put her heart in this one. Felt like you were in the palace in the early 1800's, The costumes and back drops were awesome!
B003Z0BWT0|3.0|I am a bit over the Jace and Clary restrained type romance - just get on with it guys It all gets a bit tedious with the long distance longing and misunderstandings.
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|I'm not overly picky about the movies I watch.  It's not a high bar I have for a Friday night's entertainment. At first I thought I didn't like this movie because it was targeted at 13-14 year old girls - in that the actors are basically all Justin Bieber'ish types . But my 13 year old totally awesome daughter sits here beside me, and her judgement is that this is movie is boring, and the guys are not cute.  In fact she felt worse when the dog (that turns into a monster) dies than when the main characters turn to dust in a puff of synthetic smoke.<br /><br />My lovely wife (who is always right), and ever the insightful critic, states: \\"By the end of the movie, I still didn't know what kind of alien it was. And what was the purpose was of them killing each other.\\"  \\"It's rare that we all agree that it is a terrible movie\\".<br /><br />In fact, the only thing we agreed on and liked about the movie was that the dog was cute and it's acting outdid the main characters. It turns out the acting is so bad, we laughed about it as a family, and as a result, it made us happy.<br /><br />If you choose to watch this movie, I wish you luck.  You'll need it.<br /><br />PS - My daughter raised the rating to 2 stars because of the dog.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love, Love, LOVE this show!!!  I'm a 54 yr old female and my kids said &#34; Mom, you will love Walking Dead&#34; and I said &#34;no way&#34;,...yes way I LOVE THIS SHOW...after having watched the first season, I wanted to see other zombie shows...nothing compares!!  CANNOT WAIT for season 4!!!  Love it!!! Thanks to all the writers, producers, actors, and AMC...love it and am looking forward to another 10 seasons!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This receiver was simple to setup and use. Since this is a Google product, the Chrome  browser should be installed on the pc before starting to make the process even easier. The transmission appeared to be smooth since the unit picks up the signal from the wifi router - currently an n spec.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|A great book but you must have read the preceding books to get the most from it.  Very entertaining...a few moments where disbelief must be suspended to proceed.
B00514HDNW|5.0|This book was a surprise from start to finish. Like most people (I'd imagine), I saw the movie first. Bad move! This book is absolutely NOTHING like the movie.<br />I read it in three days because I could not put it down. My wife, not a fan of vampire/zombie type books, finished it in TWO days! She couldnt put it down either!<br />A fantastic adventure and a really great book!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|This game has glitches in it. It quits spontaneously. Doesn't send drawings sometimes. Loses internet connection somehow...it is very frustrating.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I had heard so much about the book but was very disappointed when I read it........ It just seemed to drag on and on!
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I first watched this great movie by accident.  I immediately became entranced by it!  Such a wonderful tale, really great acting, and such a relief from the trash Hollywood has been spewing out for so many years.  It is a movie that has passion, tension, revenge, humor, and romance.  It is a movie that will leave you feeling so great!
0060574216|4.0|This book was insightful and thoughtfully written. It has been very interesting so far and I have read about a hundred pages.
B000I9U9A4|4.0|The producers really got into making the sound realistic. Scenes on the seas, inside the hull of the ship, and on deck with the canons firing put you right in the middle of the action. A great way to hear and feel what your subwoofer can do without going overboard.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|If you ever wanted to bash a hipster in the face with a tennis ball, then this is the game for you!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Long drawn out storyline actully had to skip through was so bored reading it to get to the seacret .Than didnt even finish it still.
B008469DGY|4.0|Solid golf-like game but feels more like a mini game than a full title.  Winds make it challenging in higher levels to keep things interesting. Learning curve is very inviting for casual gamers but intuitive enough for advanced players.<br /><br />Can't give it five stars because there's no option to play a full round of golf - it's just arcade type scoring.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This version is significantly older than the one on the Google Play Store. Don't buy it here, apparently Amazon doesn't keep their app versions up to date.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Prompt shipping & low tech enough not to need much service. If you are truly concerned about LOSING those tiny SD & tinier still microSD memory chips when they're NOT in your camera or tablet, this is the greatest little invention since ... sliced bread! The size of a credit card, it'll even store in a pocket of your tablet's cover, if that cover has pockets for credit & gift cards; if not, in a camera bag pocket or your wallet. I bought one of each style--the thinner one will store 8 microSD chips (for my NOOKs) & the thicker one will store 2 SD-sized items (my SD chip for my camera that I bought before I had my tablet and my microSD to SD adapter, so I can slip any microSD chip into either the camera or the SD slot in my laptop or printer) and 4 microSD chips. Concerned about keeping track of which chip has what files on it? This organizer even has a feature for solving that mystery! You can write on the organizer (although I haven't tried that yet so don't know how pencil vs gel ink vs ballpoint vs Sharpie work, or how erasable it may be). All in all, cleverly designed; good value for the money. Rather pay a little more for this than buy a clunkier pocket-style organizer that's maybe bigger so you don't lose it but it's harder to find a place for it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was so well written! I couldn't put it down. The characters were so real, I felt like they were in the room with me.
B0038AUY96|5.0|Something about Nesbo's writing touches a chord in me I really admire his style. The Snowman is the best so far and I've been careful to read the Harry Hole Oslo sequence in order.  The Snowman had me torn between racing to the next page the next chapter and delaying the pleasure...forcing myself to &#34;save&#34; the next page the next chapter.  I know I will get to the end as there is only a dozen pages to go... Acceptance of the inevitable end ...but then the confidence that with the end comes the next .book
B008469DGY|5.0|Love it<br />Best golf I've played  and my kids love it also<br />Can't put it down<br />Makes us late for dinner
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This novel revolves around a young Irish girl whose family was immigrating to the US looking for a better life.  Her parents both die crossing the ocean leaving her and an older brother alone.  The ship owner finds a place for the boy and takes the young girl home with him.  He places her in the kitchen house with the kitchen slaves who take her into their family and love her like one of their own.  This is look at slavery from that perspective.  I found this book very readable.
0375836675|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I loved it. It has such a powerful message. Great for young adults and adults alike.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|With each succesive book in the Sword of Truth series that I read, I get more and more drawn into the stories. Terry Goodkind is an excellent story teller. I am thoroughly enjoying the series .
0375842209|5.0|This book changed my life. There are no words to accurately and completely describe the absolute brilliance of this book. This book is powerful, and carries a powerful message. It will stay with you for a very very long time, long after it is read. This is one of those books I want to throw in everyone's face and force them to read. Be prepared for tears, and love, and a beautifully broken heart.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very concise! I Love the choice of version's and especially the audio as some times I just like to listen.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|There is a special place in hell for the network sleazebags who cancelled Firefly.  Serenity helps to bring the storyline into something like closure, although they probably could've made a half-dozen sequels, and Firefly fans will go away wanting another fix which sadly will never arrive.
B00122ORBI|4.0|It has a couple of awesome songs and a few more that mix in vocals very nicely. There were a couple of let-downs too. Overall a good album.
B007SGM084|5.0|I bought the trilogy and I'm so glad I did.  I can't put it down!  We need more Christian & Ana!
B005LJK3AC|4.0|I love when movies like this come out. They are basically just funny and a lot of fun to watch. The movie keeps it light and doesn't get too serious. There are many good laughs, this would make a great party or movie night with friends. Check it out!
B00005Q45W|5.0|I'm late to the Cohen party but can say this recording is audiophile grade in every way. Minimalist for sure....but VERY involving. This will suck you in and never let go......awesome experience on many levels....AA++ Like others I can play this for hours on end and never get tired of it....pretty rare...it eventually forces you to listen closely and rewards the time spent with aural treats...
B00DYQEB3O|5.0|This movie is excellent, although a bit old, the setting and feel of the movie along with the pace is great def a must see!! :)
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I just love the word pictures throughout this novel. I also love the characters and the beautiful way they were all worked into the story.
0891419063|5.0|E B Sledge tells it like it is.  There is nothing glorified in war!  I watch the Pacific series and want to see how close they followed the book.  When the author bears his soul and tells the truth, there is a disconnect between his words and the creative license of the producers.<br /><br />You want to know the life of the infantry in war this is the book that tells it like it is!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This item was given as a gift and was extremely well received. he color was as shown, and it worked as well as advertised. Absolutely no complaints
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Lots of fun and makes you think. More fun if you do it in challenging mode. It could be longer once you pay for full game.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|I've enjoyed this movie with my girls.  I don't have cable and therefor I don't have the disney channel to watch this movie.  Having the ability to pay for it, even at $8, I've made my monies worth.  We've seen this movie a gazzilion times.  It's fun, it's great, great music, awesome theme.
B005NPCUC8|1.0|Bad recordings songs are cut short before they end.<br />Don't waist your money when this does no justice to wonderful compositions.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|THIS IS A SUPER FUN GAME WITH FAST TURNS AND GREAT PUZZLES. This is fun for the whole family!!! Download and try today.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|When I heard Trent was getting NIN back together, actively producing a new album, and touring again, I was stoked, but didn't rush out to buy the new album. I mean, NIN was high school, you know? So many of the artists from the 90's have made come backs and left me questioning why on earth I loved them.<br /><br />However, NIN surprised me. I don't know why: they've always been a very deep, disturbingly sweet band whose songs grow on you the more you listen, so I should have been prepared to like this album. And I do. It is amazing. If you've listened to just a few songs, and decided it's not for you, try it again. Lay down on the couch, select Came Back Haunted or Find My Way, and loop them. Tell me you feel like that time was a waste when you finally do stop listening and slowly melt off the couch.<br /><br />This is an album that caught me in a really weird time, in one of the worst upheavals I've gone through. The songs, the layers in these songs, they spoke to the manic emotions I was having, calmed them, carressed them, and put them at ease. This is the album you want to listen to when you want excellent, deep dreams.<br /><br />Maybe I wouldn't be quite so enthusiastic about this album if everything was going smoothly, but honestly, how many die hard NIN fans court the perfect life? We've always been the generation difficult to pin to any single niche. That's why we embraced NIN, fell in love with Trent, and lost our virginity to Closer...<br /><br />This is the album our next generation of out-of-placers will be losing their virginity to.
0345410025|5.0|[[ASIN:0345410025 The Memory Book: The Classic Guide to Improving Your Memory at Work, at School, and at Play]]<br /><br />I bought this book in the early 80s and practiced all the techniques to successful memorization. A few years later, in college, I was taking Public Speaking and was preparing for the \\"final\\" - a 5 min talk.  I thought and thought, and came up with a speech to give, direct from Harry's book.  I hastened some quick reviews over a week's time.<br /><br />I got up in front of the class next to a blackboard (yes, 1984).  I announced that I was going to recite and write the names of all 50 states, in alpha order along with their capitals.  Then - -I did that, erased the board; I then recited all 50 states in reverse alpha order, with their capitals again.  At the end, the Prof was speechless.  I told him about the book which he never heard of.  From that final, I received an A. Get the book, it's Great!
0385341008|5.0|Love this novel.  Bought a second copy so that I could give my first one away. If you love historical fiction, you will love this one.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Blu Ray version is great.  My  daughter was introduced to the Star Wars live action universe in the proper order and I feel like a morally superior father.
0385349947|5.0|Give this gift to all your high school seniors and college age daughters.  I only wish I could have read it when I was 18.  Unfortunately Sheryl Sandberg was not yet born then and no one was writing such valuable information for women.  It addresses women of all ages but is a great guideline for those advancing their educations and considering marriage and children along with a fulfilling careeer.  Thank you Sheryl for this valuable and well written book.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|At the end of this tantalizing, literary-treat of a novel, I realized how much I was actually feeling of exactly what Piper felt....And her very candid, honest, conversational tone of writing brings the reader into Danbury with our common, everyday heroine, from her first day of \\"self-surrender\\" to the horror of, \\"but these are dirty!\\" towards the end. Further, it's difficult not to be personally inspired by Piper' s spirit as well, & the surprise of the out-pouring of kindness from not only loved ones but friends of friends who happen to stumble onto her web-site & in turn, her situation. Not only was it necessary for Piper to own up to her past mistakes (in blushing detail.)  Piper also shared an honest inside~account of what her year in federal prison was like now with the world. I thought that I'd gotten to know Piper thru the Netflix series but the diary-like book: now, even more so after hearing her own story. Would recommend this to any women looking for a different, funny, honest human interest story that is truly an emotional journey, every page. Can't wait for the next season on Netflix & thank Piper for sharing her story! Great read!  And go Piper!!  Writing with total honesty is never easy but you definitely succeed in a very liberating direction.<br /><br />-
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|love it. just as the same as the cards only with a lot of tricks in it. but as much as fun.
031603973X|5.0|This beautiful re-imagining of Charles Dickens's timeless fable, A Christmas Carol: A Pop-Up Book features artist Chuck Fischer's richly painted depictions of the tale of Ebenezer Scrooge and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, brought to life in intricate pop-up scenes by paper engineer Bruce Foster.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about Chuck Fisher's pop-up books!! A Christmas Carol is a timeless story, but now enriched in a pop up book! The colors are rich and vibrant, and the pop-ups are so creative and detailed.  The paper they are printed on is thick and of high-quality, so it will last for many many years.  Included with the book is a small pamphlet that details Charles Dicken's life.  There are also five, removable booklets that have wonderful illustrations that have the entire text of A Christmas Carol.  This is definitely a keepsake and one to treasure.  It would be perfect for gift giving this upcoming holiday season or get one for yourself.  It is truly a remarkable piece of art with a timeless story to show and tell again and again.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the music, the story going on with a bit of a twist there to really keep one's interest.  I am not sure if Mr Matthew has ever done a bad film.  I have bought this as a birthday gift and know it will be enjoyed.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|awesome, easy, and fun all in one. the perfect app for everyone. need to wake up early this app recommended, wake-up to your favorite tunes.
B00BBW14YC|5.0|This is a very beautiful and hilarious movie. It will keep you laughing and smiling. It shows there are people out there who DO care for others.  Highly recommend.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I was completely bored and fell asleep and then when I went to finish it the next night the 24 hours ran out and I could not finish it.  First time I was not mad not to finish this boring movie.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This is different than any other app I have seen. If you aren't careful you will end up spending hours making music. Well worth the price.
B00AF82WTO|4.0|It was the perfect length, about an hour and half and was Jane Austen's best love story. I liked the actors, especially,<br />Rupert_______.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I love this calendar. The views give me the information I need in a look that works for me. Whenever someone sees me looking up an appointment they always ask &#34;how do I get my calendar to look like that&#34;? I tell them for the price this is the best deal in calendars.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|This movie brings ancient Greece alive in a stunning heart-pounding spell of imagery and fun as a group of high born kids race against time completing quest after quest to save the name and life of one of the friends!!!! It's a nonstop rush of intrigue and fun as it brings your imagination to life and pulls you into it's world of Gods, Centaurs, Dragons, and Monsters, Great movie for the whole family, from 5 to 105!!!
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|This is my new favorite game. Better than Sudoku. A real challenge and a mind bender in the larger formats. Well worth the cost.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Overall a great product for a great price.<br /><br />A simple solution for people who are not technical and don't know how to accomplish the same tasks with more expensive technology.<br /><br />Check xda developers for tips and tricks on the chromecast!
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|This sudoku is lot's of fun. I like it lots more them other sudoku's I've played. Good sounds and easy to use both myself and my husband love it and play it all the time. Great app if you like sudoku , I recommend it .
B001AUKUSG|5.0|Rare vintage of a true super star of recorded music. Too bad he never reached his true potential. Sort of make me &#34;Misty, Otis Blue.&#34;
B007N8RULO|4.0|Great way to waste time, or fill in the time in a doctor's waiting room, DMV, etc. It CAN get you hooked tho, and all of a sudden you've blown 2 hours of your day!
B0001EFTVA|5.0|I simple adored this movie it was so hilarious I watch it twice and loved it more each time the second time even more enjoyable families will love to watch this with their children. Second time is always better especially if you don't understand the language of foreign films in which I don't but I still love them and purchase them
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I loved this movie. It is great Sci-Fi and if you have any appreciation of the art of filming this movie has some of the best shots I have seen since Children of Men.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|because I did like the movie and I used cushions before so I knew that I like them very much.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|I love it. It's a classic!  I have watched it 5+ times and never tire of it. It's a must see!
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Hey!  Is there another GI Joe movie in the works.  I want to see Cobra Commander get caught and be buried alive.  Hey what do you expect,  the type of review that a movie critic would give.
030758836X|5.0|Some of the best fiction I've read in a while.  Started it on the weekend and, well.... there went the entire weekend because I couldn't put it down.  Well paced, well written story of a marriage gone from heaven to hell in a few short years.  It's pretty dark so may not be for everyone, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  A look into the mind of a scary but brilliant sociopath.  I suspect there may be more than a few women out there who will read this book and secretly fantasize &#34;wish I'd thought of that.&#34;  The difference between a sociopath and the rest of us - we only think about it.  I would love to see Ms. Flynn write a sequel to this because there's a lot of story line left to tell.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I enjoy all of the  James Bond movies.  The current James Bond is OK but he should take a hint when he was told that this is young mans game, and he is not getting any younger.
0393312836|4.0|\\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is the story of Alex, a violent teenager who enjoys nothing more than assault, rape, and classical music--until he goes to prison, that is.<br /><br />While in prison, Alex undergoes a new \\"treatment\\" that is intended to correct his criminal behavior. This treatment causes him to be sickened at the thought of violence or even at the sound of classical music since he comes to associate it with violence. Alex is thus incapable of any sort of aggression, even in self-defense. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" thus asks the reader: Would it be better for us to be always non-aggressive, or should we be able to choose whether or not we are violent?<br /><br />This edition includes the twenty-first chapter that was previously excluded from the American editions of this novel. When considering this final chapter, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is also about growing up. The maturing Alex tells the reader that youth walks in a straight line and cannot help itself or be helped; it will do what it does and hit everything that gets in its way. The mature adult, however, is not so helpless, and thus Alex reevaluates his life and his goals.<br /><br />A word of warning: \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is a violent book, and the \\"nadsat\\" dialect spoken by Alex and some of the other youth might seem a bit awkward at first until you get used to it; the vocabulary is based off of Russian.
B004HYDL1K|4.0|Hey!  I just like to watch movies that have some kick but action in it.  Give me more kick but type movies
B004X80QNG|5.0|I have used Pocket Informant as my calendar app for years. Works great. I especially like the view that looks just like a paper calendar.<br /><br />No, it doesn't work on a Kindle.  Giving this app a low rating because of that,  when it tells you right up front that it won't, doesn't seem right to me. Rate the app on how well it executes what it claims to do. And it does effectively do what is promised. If you want total functionality of the Android platform, don't get a Kindle.<br /><br /> Version 3 of this app is also out, but they rebuilt it and it's really a totally different app. Giving a low rating because you can't upgrade for free from the lower version also isn't right.  The apps are way different. I got version 3 when it was released at a discount because I was a current PI  user so they do reward customers with a break. Still debating on which version I like better.<br /><br />This a is great app. Customer support with issues is top notch. I am using this app on an Asus tablet and the Droid Razr M. Give it a try. It's free today!
B002ZG98UA|5.0|Resident evil series are my favorite movies and i love adding this one to my collection because it would be right not to have it
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. The attraction of the meaning of flowers pulled me towards reading it, but as I continued to read, I couldn't stop. The only reason I gave it a 4 1/2 instead if 5 rating is because I like endings that are not predictable. I would recommend The Language of Flowers to anyone.
B009MO57H6|5.0|I love all the resident evil movies but this one more and i have watched it over and over the first day i got it
B007BVT5N4|5.0|I loved his book so much cause I'm a big fan and it was so cool to read more about his life and what it's like to be a star it's really inspiring and I hope he writes another one<3- beliber
0684857219|5.0|This is without a doubt the most informative and well done guide. It's not just a how to guide book. It gives amazing education into the anatomy and physiology and theories behind the sport. It always was and still is the ultimate bodybuilding bible.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|It was a lot of fun to read and I would like to give it FIVE STARS.  Thank you a lot.it had many mixtures of funny crazy and just plain COOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!
B000002J29|5.0|I think Genesis from the late 70's is wonderful and the sound of the band live exceeds the sound of these songs on the studio albums. The double drummers really adds to the sound. It is very full and energetic!
B0063M22QO|3.0|In haven't played this too much yet,but it seems too easy<br />.  I was expecting it to be more like the game I played on. Pogo.
B002V0GZ9M|4.0|I will be honest the acting could be better and I think this is Sandra's first movie after she started using botox (Sandy why?) but that said I love this story.  There is something about this movie that I keep coming back to and I won't apologize.  :o)  I am a fan.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The title is ironic......the vacancy caused by the council member's sudden death is not unimportant as casual implies. His absence effects the Council and the entire town.Ms. Rowling knows psychology and the characters react in a realistic way.Also,as a retired Social Worker, her descrcriptions of problem families and how we TRY to help are real.Subtracted 1 star for a bit too much obscenity for my taste.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We bought this recently for our then 6 1/2 month old daughter.  She absolutely LOVES it!  She starts bouncing before we can even turn the sound on!  We have also seen a great deal of improvement in her leg strength.  It is slightly difficult to get her legs in the leg holes properly on the first try but that is a minor inconvenience and you get the hang of it after a while.  Would give it 10 stars if I could.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Great novella. I didn't read it until after the Hugos were awarded but it's a excellent choice. It's fantasy not scifi but who cares... Fun read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best miniseries I have ever watched.  I was late in discovering Downton Abbey and so anxious to get caught up before the next season.  Season 3 was a good as the first two.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|The magic feels like a camera trick, not clever magic. That said the movie was fun and fast paced. Will be interesting to see where they go with the sequel.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A novel about race car driving and Buddhist philosophy, written by a wise and insightful dog. What's to not like?
B007I2BZIE|5.0|The story telling encompassed by this work is outstanding. Concept albums as a whole usually tend to fall flat in the middle due to an inability to maintain the story flow, but this album maintains its flow and rythm all the way through to the final cord on the final song. A master work by a trio of masters!!
0741470314|5.0|Dr. Karen Moriarty researched Michael Jackson's life to reveal a truly sweet, generous, loving man, who loved his children dearly. A musical genius, who should have received praise and admiration; never malicious lies, falsehoods, and deceit. Tom Mesereau defended Michael in his darkest hours; becoming a champion for defending our king. Michael Jackson -  King of Hearts, King of Music, King of Dance, King of Style, and King of Fathers. Thank you Karen for such an uplifting look at Michael Jackson.
B008469DGY|5.0|I DON`t play golf so I find this game enjoyable. It`s addictive though, I played a lot longer than I planned to, and only stopped because my battery was low.
1476712042|5.0|I loved this book as soon as I started reading it...fell in love with Abby and Travis how could you not I think I read this book in a weekend the dynamic between the two, the playfulness, the sweet, and also the meanness it was good. and hey Travis is a good book boyfriend love love him
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This device works great. It was a pain for me to get started because I had no Wifi Devices or a smartphone that was capable of connecting to it. When I first started there was no ChromeCast App. It is no very simple to get set up as the app does everything. It streams well just as it should but I do hope they start opening the doors for developers. There needs to be more of an option with what I can use my own device for. Side note, it gets pretty warm when connected. It's nothing to crazy though.
0345525558|5.0|What I thought might be a tragic story about foster care, was actually an absolutely beautiful story of strength, love and growth. The characters are likeable and even loveable, if sometimes frustrating. I enjoyed learning about the flowers, and how the love of one woman changed the life of a child through teaching her the language of flowers. Just a lovely novel.
B008Q0AJA2|4.0|Liked this movie when it first came out and I enjoyed watching it again. It is a very different type of role for Jim Carey! A nice change.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|Splendid acting and a deliciously entertaining plot made this a very good experience in the viewing. My only complaint was that the wife mumbles at times.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Works well with most videos, but many aren't available on mobile, and wont load on the app. Overall, a well made app.
159463176X|3.0|The plot development was very confusing in this book. It was not his usual smooth entrancing style. I was disappointed.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This allows children ( and grown ups) to use their minds while being overwhelmed and glued to tech devices.  The game is fun and stimulates thought processes to assimilate answers. Love it. I recommend for ages 10 and up.
B008469DGY|4.0|more of a &quot;hit the target&quot; game than a real golf game, but still a fun way to pass the time. Good graphics and sound, and the controls are intuitive and well done.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|I rented this movie for a nice easy distraction on a cross country plane ride.  I was completely surprised at how much I loved this movie.  It is right up there with The Princess Bride.  It is charming and funny and well acted.  I highly recommend it.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It's pretty fun although it's relatively short.  This was my first hidden object game and I really hope that the other are a bit more involved.
B0086700CM|5.0|If you have a compatible android phone or tablet, GET THIS GAME. Can't say I enjoyed the sequels to this game. This is the original version, and although the sequels boast superior graphics and added features, this original version proves that sometimes, just keeping it simple is best.
1936608898|5.0|Although many of the people I know that read this book and followed the Whole 30 diet are Crossfit buffs, I am not.  I did however accept the challenge to read the book and follow the Whole 30 diet.  First, the book is a very good, easy read.  It explains how certain chemicals and hormones not only affect how we look, but also how we feel.  I thought I was going to die the first two weeks of the program.  Lots of changes went on in my body that 30+ years of bad eating habits had done to me.  I was a diet soda addict..drank that more than water most of my life.  Second, it's not a diet per say.  It just informs you so you can make healthier choices for yourself.  Since I was in this alone, I signed up for the Whole 30 daily emails for an entire month.  Just when I thought I couldn't do it, something in the daily email struck a chord, and I could.  I have maintained most of the dietary changes I made when I started the Whole 30.  It truly does start with food.  I haven't had a headache in months now.  Sleep better and just overall feel so good! You can find the Whole 30 information on the Whole9.com website.  If you are on the fence, try it.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This is a fascinating read; well- thought out and documented, putting Jesus the man in sociological context. I personally did not appreciate Aslan's relatively scornful tone towards what he terms the \\"Jewish cult,\\" and his treatment of some of its members. Overall, however, this work echoes much of what  Bart Ehrman and Elaine Pagels have brought out about the various flavors of early Christianity, and does a compelling job of putting Jesus in the flow of Palestinian politics of that period.

B004SEUJ82|3.0|As a movie and work of fiction, I think this movie was a good movie if you don't take history into account.  It was a little slow in parts, but overall the movie was engaging.  If I was only judging the movie based on its merit as a movie, I would rate it 4 stars.  However when a story regards a very important part of history, I don't think you can look at them separately.  You have to look at how closely to history the movie comes to representing the era about which it is written.  Sadly this movie is all fiction.<br /><br />Because of Bruno's naivety as well as Shmuel's, I don't find the story plausible.  I also find it offensive that it could convey the message that it would be easy for a German to form a friendship with a Jew in a concentration camp.  Historically German males were indoctrinated through Hitler Youth at very young ages, and they would not be ignorant on the subject of the Jew especially at Bruno's age.  I'm also pretty sure that Jews knew that death surrounded them and a 8-year-old Jewish boy in a concentration camp would be wise beyond his years.  He would know that his father was gassed or burned.  He would not be able to sneak off by himself to strike up a friendship with a German boy.  Officers would have been overseeing all of the population at the concentration camp, so I don't think anyone would be able to go off by themselves. I would imagine that SS officers patrolled the entire fenceline to ensure it was protected, so Bruno digging under the fenceline would never happen.  There are just too many holes in the story to make it believable.<br /><br />I think it's a nice try by the author to create an alternate reality so to speak.  A what if ___ happened?  But no matter what fairy tale story you want to make, there is just no way this could have happened.  In some ways it is like the author is desperately trying to make an atrocity have a human element to it.  An innocence that has never been substantiated by history.  No matter how much you want to believe that one human group could never do something this inhumane to another human group, sadly it does happen.  It has happened.  We must learn from history, so history does not repeat itself.  But trying to rewrite history by changing the Nazi mindset to include innocence of the German youth is not only untrue but offensive to the millions of Jews who died by Nazi hands.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This game is pretty much an updated Atari game, but it is pretty fun. I don't know that I will play it again, but it did the job while I watched this horribly one-sided football game.

B008ACC9CM|4.0|It could just as easily be &#34;Charlotte & Jonathan&#34;;  Charlotte has a beautiful cultured and mature quality to her soprano voice.  Jonathan's voice is also beautiful; he gets a little hard to hear when he is singing in the softer range though.  Although I don't mind the opera genre, I hope at least Charlotte will make an album in the pop genre, and in english.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Many of the songs on this CD sound as if the Beatles were reborn. Their energy is great. Don't miss this CD.

B008C20TDG|5.0|My husband and I did the whole30 challenge, it was the easiest diet  we have tried. I normally don't buy the book associated with a diet plan. This one seemed essential because I wanted the pep talks to get me through the month. The pep talks were really helpful and we will continue to use this plan probably several times a year.
B00DBSZEH2|2.0|this was so cheezy.  Even our teenager who usually enjoys these types of movies thought it was dumb.  Only watched it for Jeremy Renner
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Takes up too much memory on the tablet. I removed it about a week later, and I just did not use it.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I really liked this book. The only thing I didn't love about it was the ending - I felt there should have been more to it. But overall this book was a great quick read, love how it was told him first person of a 5 year old - very sweet and innocent. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who reads!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|...you'll love The Tudors. Well-made and beautiful to watch, great actors. This type of show seems to be the new &#34;hot&#34; ticket: politics, betrayal, sex, power-struggles, complex story-lines.  I'm addicted.

I'm a proud Oregonian and I'm proud that Richard had decided to film this movie on the coast.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This item was purchased as a last minute attempt to &#34;work around&#34; a known manufactures defect regarding a small percentage of the Kindle Fire batterys.  Since I had bought 4 of the Kindles, I was deeply disturbed that there had been such an issue and no notice had been given.<br /><br />Amazons first choice of resolution was simply to offer a discounted Fired HD, which in my opinion was rewarded Amazon for selling a defective product, so I refused that offer.  So after sticking to my guns, Amazon finally relented and gave this product with FREE shipping.  The end result was success.<br /><br />AND Amazon showed me that they are a company that will do the right thing for their customers.... only after their feet were held to fire! (pun intended)<br /><br />For this reason, I will purchase future Kindle products and continue to purchase many items on Amazon!

B0085RQLXK|4.0|Overall I like this album however, it seems that this is all the leftovers from their work in the 90's.  It sounds like they just re-wrote songs from Get A Grip, Nine Lives, and Just Push Play.  It has that Aerosmith sound but it is not a sound that has evolved.
1449410243|3.0|I thought the book was okay but would not highly recommend. Cartoons started out funny at the beginning but got to be boring as the book progressed.

B00EE9A8OQ|5.0|After buying the Metal album from 2007, I was a bit disappointed.  It had some very good tracks, but was a bit too similar throughout.  I was really looking forward to this release, and it is quite good.  I think it is a step in the right direction with a lot of good driving thrash, and I hope it's sign of the future, and maybe a solid lineup.  There are more hits than misses on this album, and would be a disservice to any Annihilator fan not to pick this one up.<br /><br />I think the bonus disc with the re-recorded tracks is outstanding.  It is a great way to get some new fans interested in Annihilator.  The re-recorded Fun Palace, Allison Hell, Never, Neverland, and Set the World on Fire are enough for the purchase.  In my opinion, it was nice to hear more bass and drums in the tracks, and everything sounds quite crisp and energetic.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|Wonderful war story, with science fictional elements. It feels very honest. I knew nothing about this book beforehand, and was quickly mesmerized. I love the nonchalant tone, because it is the frank descriptions themselves that end up moving the the reader. Billy is so direly flawed but it's so endearing. I loved it, through and through.

B005RDF2RG|5.0|Funny, very well done in all aspects, and as far as I'm concerned, safe for the kids. Who could want anything more? I highly recommend even if you aren't all that crazy about animated films. This one is one of the best ever made, for sure!
1608871827|5.0|This book was gorgeous, full of well executed artwork and visual stills from the movie and it's production.  The extras were fun, and it rounded out the world this movie was set in.  For people who enjoy the art behind their movies, this is a must have.

0785153942|5.0|This graphic novel is a lot of the story before the movie begins, giving you more lead up, essentially, to the movie which was in theatres this summer.  The artwork is excellent, the story good, and my only complaint was that it wasn't longer.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Miserables of Victor Hugo is a terrific work that will always and all times have something critical to say to the humanity. This book is in many ways what we will call in french &#34;la conscience critique&#34; of the human society.

B009Z5BPZK|5.0|I love GG and this dvd was in good shape even though i watched it over and over and over again.
B003L20ICE|4.0|This is one of those intricate and complex stories that can't be properly hilighted or encapsulated in any movie preview... so whatever preview trailer you may have seen of this movie, just remember there's much more to it.  Although this is an ensemble cast movie, I think Annette Bening deserves most of the credit for her marvelous potrayal of  Nic.  Annette Bening & Julianne Moore play Nic & Jules, a middle-aged lesbian couple with two children (conceived from a sperm donor).  Nic (Bening) is a doctor.  Jules (Moore) is a landscape designer.  They have a loving and happy life with their two grown children; Joni (Mia Wasikowska) & Laser (Josh Hutcherson).  But, their lives are disrupted when Joni & Laser decide to contact their sperm donor father; Paul (Mark Ruffalo).  That's the basic premise.  But, there is so much more to the story.  Laser (Hutcherson) has a friend, Clay (Eddie Hassell), who seems hell-bent on dangerous stunts, destroying property, and general teenage self-destruction.  Paul (Ruffalo) is an aimless man, currently involved with a very sexy and beautiful free-spirited woman; Tanya (Yaya Alafia), until he meets his biological kids and Nic & Jules.  At first, Nic welcomes him into their lives, until Paul has an affair with Jules.  This is where the story gets intense... the tearing apart of the close-knit bond between Nic & Jules, and their children.  As I said, Bening is marvelous in her performance.  Moore is also very good, though the filmmakers chose to film her in a way to accent every freckle, every wrinkle, and cause her to look flabby, sickly pale and generally haggard; despite that in reality, she is a beautiful woman with a great body.  Speaking purely in opinion; I think Paul is an idiot for abandoning the great relationship he had with the sexy and beautiful Tanya in order to pursue an affair/relationship with Jules, a confirmed lesbian.  But, of course, it's necessary to the plot, as this affair is what tears the family apart.  This isa great movie and a very intense slice of life.
1594200106|5.0|Loved the writing, plot and characters in this book.  Zafon is a great writer and I have to say that this story is one of my favorite's of all time.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The book was dull and dragged on at points, there were some good parts and page turners but for the most part I was disappointed in this book.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|If you want a detailed explanation of why we had to bail out the banks and auto industries, and where all the money actually went then watch this movie. It can get a bit hard to follow but you will definitely understand how crooked some industrial leaders are. Good documentary with lots of statistics.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game takes a while to get started but once you do its pretty sweet. Definitely worth the 0 dollars I spent on it. Great freebie!
B00122PJ4W|5.0|...And I really, really wore that CD out when it first came out years ago. Robert Plant never ceases to amaze me, the way he reinvents himself over the years. The man's in his 60s, and he's still cranking out fantastic music. While &#34;Band of Joy&#34; showcases a mild and folksy version of Plant, &#34;Rearranger&#34; is all over the place, yet very complete. I think this is Robert Plant at his experimental best!
B00E3UN44W|5.0|Well, I must say, Moffat didn't disappoint us! Sherlock explaining to John that the Doctor swooped in last minute in his TARDIS to save him as he fell, and him and John professing their undying love for each other, was a great way to kick off the season! I was, however, a little confused as to why they broke into song half way through the first episode, but with every sherlock episode comes a little confusion, I suppose!<br /><br />((I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it))
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|...but that's to be expected. Me personally, their best album to date is &#34;Songs for The Deaf,&#34; as it is the Queens at their most complete. If you've lasted with QOTSA for this long, then you'll buy this album, most likely sight (or sound) unseen. Standout tracks include &#34;Fairweather Friends&#34; and &#34;I Sat By The Ocean.&#34;  Very good album, but they not as cutting edge as their previous efforts...

B00C061I3K|5.0|I love each and every track on this CD. I never paid much attention to Daft Punk before I heard a couple tracks online, and I was immediately hooked. The tracks are so clean, brilliantly engineered and mastered. One of my favorites right now.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|Finally Plantronics provided a protective case for the Voyager. Besides cradling the headset, it also charges it and can be charged separately from the headset for those extra-long road trips. What a great idea! That said, Plantronics missed the mark on the power cords. The power cord for the headset uses a proprietary magnetic clamp while the power cord for the case uses a standard micro USB plug. This means having to carry two cords on the road instead of one. This is needlessly complicated. Furthermore, the case is not made to hold either cord, though it does have a slot for a USB receiver that only some users will need. The case would be better if it had an retractable USB cord for connecting to a computer or wall plug.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I plugged in my Chromecast and was going through the setup.  When I got to connecting to my network, Chromecast was able to find the network, but could not connect to it.  I called the helpful 24x7 support number and got a very quick answer to my problem:  the device controlling the Chromecast must itself be connected to the wireless network to which you are attaching the Chromecast.  This network requirement should be made clear in the technical requirements for the device.  Perhaps it might be obvious to others, but it wasn't to me. After connecting my PC to my wireless network, I attempted the setup again.  Although my PC and the Chromecast were both able to see the network, they could not interact.  Google has workarounds for some router brands and models, but not all. Apparently, there is not yet a workaround for the Netgear N150.  Ultimately, I returned the product as being unusable with my other hardware.
B007XH6BPG|3.0|Recommended with caveats:<br /><br />I might give it 3.5 stars in a few more listens, but one cannot help but feel disappointed by this c.d.  On paper I cannot imagine a better pair (think \\"Voyage of the Acolyte\\" crossed with \\"Fish Out of Water\\")...but there is a very MOR sheen covering the Squackett release that is best summarized as Godawful Eighties Production.<br /><br />What is most surprising is that one would expect 2 virtuoso musicians to emphasize instrumental interplay but that's not what we get here.  The songs are pretty fair but nowhere near the best of Hackett or Squire's better works.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this c.d. is the horrible (programmed?) thudding drum sound so typical of the worst corporate rock schlock.<br /><br />I hope Squackett releases another album.  My fingers are crossed...
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Amazing album!  We live in Bakersfield, CA and are excited to hear Vince Gill perform this great music live!  The album is a wonderful rendition of music that highlights the Bakersfield sound!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The Orphan Masters Son was difficult to read, but it kept your interest up. The novel was brutally graphic about life and the citizen who had no choice in any matter of their life.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Plenty has already been said about Card's masterpiece, &#34;Ender's Game.&#34; Thus, I shall not repeat what has already been reviewed exhaustively.<br /><br />I will instead focus on the technique the author used along with his voice and the political allegory involved.<br /><br />I would first like to praise the author's use of the third person unlimited perspective, shifting between that and limited in flawless fashion. The flow between the &#34;god&#34;-like perspective and the individual POVs of each of the viewpoint characters is seamless and flows like a river through a valley floor. There are no jarring moments where one has to pause to figure out how one arrived from dealing with the politics on earth to a sudden battle that has materialized in the blackness of space. The children, being geniuses, and the officers, being masterminds, provide the perfect vehicles for the delivery of this narrative. This author most definitely knows how to use each character's different knowledges, wisdoms, and ignorances to his advantage, weaving a story that is incomplete one moment, and then complemented by another character in a different point of view. I thank you, Orson Scott Card, for a wonderful experience in this aspect.<br /><br />The author's voice is also very smooth and devoid of poor word choice. The shifts between the objective narrator and the subjective thoughts of the characters are executed with excellence. No communication is lost in the conveyance of both story and characterization within the same paragraph. Ah, but perhaps the paragraphs are where I would subtract some points for being much longer than usual, though I refrain from doing so as this book was written long before another different kind of Games. Nowadays, we have much shorter paragraphs crafted for varying effects.<br /><br />***Potential Spoiler Here***<br />Card's political allegory, involving both domestic affairs on earth and interstellar affairs, will never become obsolete. They are more relevant now than ever, as we are in an age in which information circles the globe at light speed, bringing to illumination such offenses as the persecutions of the Karen and Rohingya in what is now called Myanmar, the regular massacres and non-illegal war rapes committed daily in the numerous African nations, the never-ending oppression of the North Korean people. Card does not deal with these individual issues on a micro level in his novel, but they are all related to what actually does happen in the story. The same thing happened to the Native Americans during European expansion into this half of the globe. Along this thread, I would like to add something a professor of mine once told us, one Dr. Olga Griswold of Cal Poly Pomona. In our sociolinguistics class, she said that &#34;when a language dies, an entire culture dies.&#34; In this case, the &#34;buggers&#34; stood no chance for they had no language to speak of. They were dead from the start, with no chance against the vengeful wrath of the fighting animal known as Homo sapiens. Ironic that &#34;sapiens&#34; is Latin for &#34;wise.&#34;<br /><br />And now, with the looming military action in Syria, the militarism presented in this novel will always be perfectly relevant no matter which culture is dominant on this earth. The greatest cultures to ever reign in human history have unilaterally been militaristic. The next great culture to dominate this planet will undoubtedly see relevance with this novel. Perhaps it may even be censored by the next &#34;Minitrue&#34; (in our age, it is the NSA). This discussion on militarism certainly does not level with the likes of &#34;Starship Troopers,&#34; but is effective nonetheless.<br /><br />The only portion in which Card is lacking (I attribute this to the norms of his time) is in the dialogue. Though it does not interfere with communication (as far as I am concerned anyway), there was at least one point in the narrative where I had to go back several lines to figure out who the heck was talking between Ender and Val. Dialogue tags are unnecessary in an exchange once identities have been established, but because of Card's style, which is to incorporate individual personae with entire blocks of text, dialogue tags are omitted and one must be more attentive than perhaps a (very) casual reader might be. I likely screwed up in this category because I plowed through the entire novel in a single day and my brain was rather exhausted from working in an office for eight hours beforehand. Needless to say, perhaps that was not the wisest decision, but I digress.<br /><br />Highly recommended, mainly for adults and more...mature children, just like that other Game.re out who the heck was talking between Ender and Val.

140006922X|5.0|For students of the historical period in which Jesus of Nazareth lived and how that impacts our understanding of the man Jesus this is essential, and even thrilling, reading. But do not suppose you will necessarily like the outcome. It might change your belief system!<br /><br />The book is beautifully written. Reza is not just a scholar, he is a writer. The text is not riddled with footnotes. It's a smooth, easy read. The scholarly discussions and references are all at the back of the book, and I took the time to read that material as well.<br /><br />I have often delved into this historical period trying to tie together all the different threads, from the books of the Apocrypha, the New Testament, the Dead Sea Scrolls, early historians and the early church fathers. That's a tall order. The good news is that Reza Aslan has done all that for us. Reading the notes and bibliography there I found are all the scholars whose names I knew, and some of whose books I read, when I was a divinity student in London in the 1960s.<br /><br />How I wish I had seen this book 40 years ago - but then our author was only a year old!<br /><br />In places I feel Aslan makes unsupported and somewhat sweeping assertions. I don't have the time right now to go back and find chapter and verse (So here I am making an unsupported sweeping assertion. My apologies!) But I just made a mental note and moved on. This is a compelling read. The gradual unwrapping of Jesus and the way in which the author explains Jesus' re-packaging by the Gospel writers and Paul, then subsequently by the Christian Church as it gained ascendancy in the Roman empire, brings everything into a very clear perspective.<br /><br />The Bible student will appreciate the clarity with which the book explains the nature of the early Jesus movement in Jerusalem after the resurrection and before Paul's arrival on the scene. It blows away the pious gloss that most preachers give to the early chapter of Acts. The contention between Paul and James takes on a whole new light.<br /><br />I have one issue. I found no scholarly reference to the massive works by Robert Eisenman - a prominent Dead Sea Scrolls expert. Even if Aslan would totally repudiate Eisenman's conclusions, I think this professor's work should have been noted.<br /><br />Now here is my reason. Jesus of Nazareth lived and died in the time when the Essene community, probably headquartered at Qumran, had widespread influence in much Jewish thought. Alsan admits that John the Baptist may have been associated with the Essene movement. But he finds little reason to associate Jesus with the community. In fact Aslan find very slim likelihood that Jesus was educated at all. He is frequently referred to, almost dismissively, as the day laborer from Nazareth. The author seems not to allow that remarkable people can rise from very primitive roots with a native intelligence that beggars their upbringing. The debate over the authorship of Shakespeare's plays would be an echo of this.<br /><br />To get back to Robert Eisenman. He builds a very strong case that Jesus was very aware of Essene thought and apocalyptic expectations. Granted, what we might perceive to be Jesus' understanding, or Jesus' words, may have been layered on top subsequently by later writers (the four Gospels) it still betrays the belief that Jesus was part of the seething and often violent opposition to the Roman occupiers. With a careful analysis of the NT texts Eisenman finds coded references to the real meaning of Jesus's message that Aslan seems to have overlooked. In sum, Jesus and the Gospels are far more intertwined with Essene type thought than has previously been recognized.<br /><br />I'm planning to drop a line to Reza Aslan to ask for his comments on this. You can make up your own mind.<br /><br />That aside - a wonderful book. Thank you Reza Aslan!Paul and James takes on a whole new light.<br /><br />I have one issue.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Bob Dylan<br />\\"Bootleg Series v.10: Another Self Portrait: 1969-1971\\"<br />(Columbia Legacy, 2013)<br /><br />I tend to think of Bob Dylan's oft-reviled 1970 \\"Self Portrait\\" album as one of the first records he did where he wasn't trying so hard to prove a point, where he just let go of the rock star thing and followed his own interests as a music fan, rather than as a much-parsed, groundbreaking iconic innovator.  That impression is borne out by the release of the tenth volume in his self-curated \\"Bootleg\\" series, where outtakes and demos from those sessions reveal just how deeply he was getting into reconnecting with his simpler folkie roots.<br /><br />There are alternate versions of songs that appeared on the album, as well as a number of tracks that were recorded at the same time, but not included in the final 2-LP set. A lot of these are straight-up folk songs, chestnuts like \\"Pretty Saro\\" and \\"Railroad Bill,\\" as well as a demo version of the old murder ballad, \\"Little Sadie,\\" which did make it onto the album, albeit in souped-up form.  What I hear in these sessions is Dylan the flashy, genre-busting songsmith going back to the well, relaxing a little, taking the time to actually enjoy the kind of music that originally inspired his love of folk music, and using that experience to propel himself forward.  Many of these tracks are just Dylan and acoustic guitarist David Bromberg farting around and jamming, alternating between goofiness and sincerity, but palpably having fun with the music.  You can sense, as well, that while he's pickin' and singin' these old-fashioned hootenanny tunes, Dylan's subconscious mind is moving along a little further down the line; while he relaxes and takes the pressure off, the familiar old melodies quietly open up new creative paths -- you can also sense that Bromberg knew this as well, and was just there to give Dylan the kind of unfussy, unhurried accompaniment he needed at the time.<br /><br />It's a fascinating aural document: \\"Self Portrait\\" was panned at the time, and though it's retroactively gained a loyal following, it still remains one of his lesser albums.  For my money, these demos and outtakes supersede the studio album, revealing the richer emotional undercurrent to a record that many perceived as a pointed rejection of fame and the expectations pressed upon Dylan by his critics and his fans.  These sessions show something else: a musician rejecting the pressures of celebrity so that he could enjoy music again.

We liked it so much that we even recommended it when we reviewed the bjorn potty chair we bought from Amazon.  This book is beautifully illustrated, and filled with light humor.  The best part is when it asks, &#34;what's that&#34; and the little characters face turns in to a surprised &#34;o&#34; mouth face- my husband and I make this face for our son when he uses the potty and he squeals with delight.  It really is great.  We look forward to adding all of the Leslie Patricelli books to our collection.  Thanks

There might be more, but let's focus on this album, Sum 41s third attempt at a CD. The cuts get really boring, not as boring as a select few in my collection. As far as boring cuts go, this album has some good tracks such as \\"I'm Not The One\\" and \\"Some Say\\". Some of the songs that are absolutely downright boring are \\"Pieces\\" and \\"The Bitter End\\". Even though I don't have crucially negative opinions or negative opinions in general about this album, Sum 41 does not peak here. Instead of this, I recommend their next album \\"Underclass Hero\\" as the choice of Sum 41s peak.

1452000247|5.0|The writing in Peter - A Darkened Fairytale reminded me of a cross between Alice in Wonderland, Harry Potter and the original Hobbit.  O'Brien draws you in so totally with his descriptive writing you can accurately and vividly visualize each scene.  If I had to compare the imagery to a movie, I would suggest this could easily be turned into an animated picture along the same lines as the original Hobbit with its grand adventures and interesting characters.<br />Peter is an average boy who comes into a great quest on his tenth birthday.  The story lines of elfin, talking mushrooms, The Path of Information and other countless characters that could only have been born of a creative imagination will hold you until the very end.<br />If you have a young or middle-grade reader who loves stories that capture their imagination and takes them to faraway places with quests befitting the even the bravest soul, this story is for them, and parents will enjoy reading it with them as well.<br />Bravo to O'Brien for creating such a marvelous piece of imaginative, creative writing.  This is one that will surely entertain young readers for many years!

B001R4MEUM|5.0|The last album by the original Genesis lineup, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, is in many ways like a painting. It has many textures and musical colors, and to some it may be magnificent, while to others it might be an ugly waste of time. I'm among the former club. While it's not the best album by Genesis, it is by far their most unique. I won't get into the various implications of the story, even though this is supposed to be a concept album. In fact, I think that's the weakest point regarding the album. I understand that most concept albums are supposed to be outlandish, but I don't think that necessitates a story quite as convoluted and indecipherable as this. It is supposed to be the tale of Rael, a Puerto Rican thug who gets sucked into an alternate dimension beneath the streets of New York. Uh... okay, we'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't think there was ever a need for a concept behind these songs. They are some of the very best Genesis ever wrote, mixing every element of their by that point enormous musical repertoire to create a sound unlike anything yet seen and never again imitated. The opening eponymous track contains one of the hardest rocking bass lines anywhere in rock music, much less prog spheres. In the Cage contains what is in my opinion the greatest synthesizer solo ever. While he doesn't seem to have as much  of a presence as he did on the previous albums, Steve Hackett delivers one of the hardest guitar parts ever recorded on Fly on A Wind Shield. Of course, Peter Gabriel deserves great credit on his vocals, as he sings each song in a unique way and never loses credibility because of it.<br /><br />The album is divided into two very distinct parts. The first contains some of the most accessible songs made by Genesis (all the aforementioned songs are on the first disc), and I must admit that I'm a much bigger fan of this part of the album. That does not mean the second part is not good. It certainly has its own highlights, and overall contains much more beautiful and haunting music than the latter half. But it is overall much less digestible then the first disc, and isn't nearly as much fun.<br /><br />Overall, despite its rather ridiculous concept, the Lamb is perhaps the finest of all Genesis albums. It's not my favorite, and it is brought down slightly by its somewhat indecipherable second half, but it's still the most perfected record of their early catalog. Peter Gabriel left the band after this album, and it was perhaps to his credit that he did: Genesis simply could not make a record any better than this.erall contains much more beautiful and haunting music than the latter half.

It's a beautiful, beautiful film to watch, made all the more fascinating by its visual impeccability. I LOVE this film! In an era when special effects are 'enough' to draw an audience, this film also has something to say. Breath-taking vistas and edge of your seat plot development. Kudos all around.

Just plug it into your hdmi port on your TV and supply power to it either with the adapter or USB port.<br />2.  Software setup is simple too. I set it up using the Chromecast app on my iphone.<br />3.  Once you set it up, its easy to play youtube and netflix videos from your phone onto the TV.<br /><br />Here's where my initial experience abruptly ended.  There is no remote to control anything.  No built in browser or app of any sorts.<br /><br />I then got on my PC and installed the &#34;google cast&#34; extension to the Google Chrome Browser.  This enabled me to duplicate my chrome browser tab onto the TV by clicking on a button on the browser toolbar.  That is pretty cool but the down side is that the computer has to be turned on while streaming and it simulcasts what you see on the chrome browser screen only.  There is a 1/2 second lag between the video on the computer screen and TV.  (sound is turned off on the computer automatically and comes only from the TV).  Once you close the browser, the streaming ends as well.<br /><br />I also noticed that if you have any subscription based live video services like willow.tv which uses youtube.com live broadcast, this feature is not supported by Chromecast yet.<br /><br />I am hoping to see apps built for the chromecast in the near future.

Tiny Love Gymini Move & Play, Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym, and Fisher-Price Rainforest 1-2-3 Musical Gym.<br /><br />Here's my comparison:  The first two, made by Tiny Love and Baby Einstein are very similar.  They both come with lots of toys to dangle, and you can also add your own.  They have lights and music which my son LOVES, and there is space to place other toys around my son for him to grab.  Both can fold flat in half easily without taking them apart and can store in between my couch and coffee table, so they are easily and quickly put away and taken out when needed.  Both are easy to wash, I just take off the arches and wash the mat part.  This is important if your baby spits up a lot like mine :)  I do not put them in the drier.  Here are the differences:  I like the Tiny Love mat better because it is much larger, so when my little guy starts to squirm around more, he will have more space to play.  Also when I lay next to him and talk to him, he can see me better with the Tiny Love mat (on the baby einstein mat, the toys are lower and closer together so they are always blocking him from seeing me).  Also, the Tiny Love mat is adjustable so that you can move the intersection of the two arches down so that your baby can look at the lights and music even during tummy time.  Since my son is not particularly fond of tummy time, this helps a lot.  The Tiny Love mat also has sides that fold up, which I haven't used yet but I'm thinking these might be useful when he starts playing with toys that can roll away but before he starts crawling.  The Baby Einstein mat comes with a little whale that you can prop baby up with for tummy time.  This doesn't work well for us because is is asymmetrical and he always ends of sliding to one side and becomes uncomfortable, so we don't use the whale.<br /><br />The third mat, made by Fisher Price, I really do not care for at all.  Is it so small that there is no space for me to place any toys around my son, nor can he move more that a few inches without being at the edge of the mat.  The arch dangles too low so toys suspended from it are nearly touching is face, although the arch is not directly over his face anyways so he doesn't even really care about those toys.  Although it's small, I would have to disassemble it in order to make it flat, which is not difficult but with a baby, I have better things to do, so it actually takes up more space to store than the other two I reviewed.  There are no lights and minimal music.  Disassembly to wash it is difficult since I have to take off the plastic sides.  The only thing my son likes about this mat is the mirror, which he looks at during tummy time.  (both other mats also have mirrors though)  Pretty  much, by son is better off just laying on a blanket.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The author alternates chapters from the view point of three women whose lives are, unbeknownst to them, intertwined.  Each character is well-developed, unique and real.  Told with insights of humor even though this is about a murder of a teenage girl.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great, me and the kids both enjoy playing this game. I would definitely recommend this app, it's much better than the other bingo apps.
B0024F08UG|5.0|I was looking for this movie in all imaginable stores and nobody had it. Only Amazon as always was the only one to stock this movie and in blue ray. Thank you for being sucha a nice place that has everything.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I always fear for television this good, because so many so many exceptional series have disappeared after one season. But, like the classic, &#34;West Wing, &#34; &#34;The Good Wife&#34; has survived and, season after season, delivers well crafted and produced television. The writers and actors bring us strong, three-dimensional characters with interesting stories. There is very little in television I watch any more, so I sincerely hope this wonderful series continues.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this show!<br />The packaging is great! The DVDs obviously are great! And the special features are also super enjoyable!<br />Just don't make the mistake of watching any special features before watching the shows, haha! That would be a massive spoiler!<br />Still waiting on Season 3 to be sent to me! :)
B0085CXVOC|5.0|An adventure on the order of Indiana Jones. This movie that has killing and romance without gore and sex! PG13
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Can't wait to watch all seasons at once...when want to...Love Masterpiece and Downton. Come on Season 4, let's get it started
159463176X|5.0|Although not quite as compelling as his first 2 books, I still found this one to be composed of wonderful stories--still, a great storyteller--and as always with great insight into his characters' many-layered and contradictory beliefs, fears, emotions--in other words, great insight into the human mind and soul.  The same can be said for the deep look into, and the ever-changing faces of Afghanistan. I glean much knowledge, understanding and a very visceral sense of the land from his books. Thank you Khaled Hosseini.
B00D8H3Q2G|1.0|Not 5.1 Sound... Just Stereo classic CD, no bonus... This is the same sounds like old issue...It's very sad for one of best Vangelis' Album...
B00DAXXO98|5.0|A little darker than &#34;West Wing&#34; but just as smart, engaging and sustainable. The writing, directing and acting is marvelous. The story line and characters reflect what many in our country believe politics is like &#34;behind-the-scenes.&#34; What could have been dark and cynical is offset by subtle humor and Spacey (like Tony Soprano) becomes a villain we love, in spite of ourselves. Please, please please let there be another season.

B00E1L9N8E|2.0|I wasn't a fan of the way the movie was put together, the storyline, the characters - it all seemed dull.
B001RP1G0U|5.0|Great cast, subtle and stabbing humor, a story we can all relate to! Must see for all of us who have lost love and want to find it again!
B007XH6BPG|3.0|Not too bad but if you are looking for Voyage of the Acolyte or Spectral Mornings (Hackett Classics) or Fish out of Water (Squire's Masterpiece) you will be somewhat disappointed.  Definitely worth a listen and tends to grow on you.  More poppy than those classics but still a good album.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|this app application as working very well for me it does exactly what it states and I would recommend it<br />great free application
0062014536|3.0|My review will be like many others so I'll try and keep it short...<br /><br />I LOVED the first two books!!! I listened to them on tape while driving to work (and any other moment I could) and was totally engrossed. The third book was just as engrossing, mainly because I was already in love with the characters and plot.<br /><br />What was GREAT about this book (and series):<br />1. Strong female characters, in fact most of the leaders were women.<br />2. Interesting plot<br />3. Love triangle<br />4. Beautifully written<br />5. The story represented many different kinds of love.<br />6. Told in two perspectives<br /><br />That being said.....is this really the last book?!?! Cant be!<br /><br />The reason for my three starts is because I feel gypped. I feel like I was getting to the end of an amazing movie and then the electricity went out. As I was listening to the last couple chapters I noticed that there was not a lot of time left and sooooooo many questions unanswered. I am flabbergasted that Lauren Oliver would end her series like this. She just abandoned it at the end. At the end of the final chapter it reads: \\"Tear down the walls!\\" (or something of that nature) Lauren Oliver left so many walls up with this ending.  If you plan on reading/listening to this book be prepared to be left with a mystery and have to make up an ending for yourself.
0345529057|5.0|I purchsed these to catch up with the story, before I start watching it (since I recently obtained the channel as part of my package, when I changed cable providers). It's a good read. ;)

B0001I561E|5.0|DVD works great...no scratches. It was my anniversary gift to my husband...he always looked for the film, but either never found it or got bad copies of it...he's happy...
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Fun and adictive, but ads kept popping up and were very bothersome.  You can't make them go away unless you purchase a pass for them.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this because it was required reading for middle and high school kids in our town. I had my daughter read it because I hoped she'd learn something. Thank God I did. It is the golden rule contemporized for the tween culture. I know the lessons of this novel will guide her throughout her life.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I really enjoyed this and then one day when I opened it, it seemed to be &quot;updated&quot;. I lost most of the progress I had made and only earn about half the coins that I had previously earned. I refuse to buy coins for what is supposed to be a FREE game and I think that is why I lost so much. I don't play as much and I'm considering deleting it to free up space for apps I will use.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really liked the action in the film, was impressed with the story line and I really enjoyed this movie.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|Couldn't get other notes to import. Difficult to navigate thru the different menu's. Looked like it would be a great app at first.
0553801473|3.0|While ADWD was for me an entertaining read for the most part (partly because I had nothing else to do at the time), many of the stories go nowhere. GRRM said he just had too much for the sequel to a Storm of Swords to fit into one book, and so we get two books, one featuring Cersei slooooowly destroying the Lannister legacy at King's Landing, and a bunch of random side characters barely doing anything. In this one most of his 'star' characters do jack s*** as well.<br /><br />Tyrion: Maybe the worst chapters, aside from the first two chapters, Tyrion basically rides on a boat going to see Dany, and he basically plays Westero's chess with some Targaryan relatives that have before been completely unintroduced and have established no reason to care about them. Tyrion meets these characters and has tons of inner monologue about everyone on the ship, and with him is another midget-girl, who (as another Amazon review noted) is the equivelent of Jar Jar Binks for ASOIAF. Tyrion never makes it to his destination and instead slogs around in chapters that try to hook you, for example Tyrion seeing stone people who pull him over the ship, whoa, where's this going, did Tyrion di-DON'T WORRY, everything in the chapters afterwards are the exact same as the preceding ones, Tyrion on a boat. *SNORE*<br /><br />Daenery's: GURM seems to have a running theme throughout AFFC & ADWD where women apparently can't rule for s***(just like real life). Dany feeling good about freeing the city from slavery now faces starvation and disease, and prettymuch takes all of her advisers advice while she day dreams about Daario. Like Tyrion, her chapters are sluggish and neverending, and I found myself skimming through her chapters. Despite the book's title the dragons are locked up for most of the book not doing anything while we follow the mother of dragons failing miserably at ruling. Finally near the last two chapters, something starts to happen, then the book's over. Yay.<br /><br />Jon: His chapters are a little more interesting. He's basically trying to organize the wildlings and night's watch to work together for the impending white walkers, as well as tolerating Stannis' wife and ignoring Melisandre's advice. By the end of the book not much happened here too, but the chapters were still interesting enough to read all the way. Then he suddenly dies. Lol.<br /><br />Theon/Reek: By far the best chapters in ADWD, we see what was once Theon after the tortures of the Dreadfort accompany the Bolton's to Winterfell to establish their claim to the North. His chapters were not only page-turners that kept me up at night, but they were also haunting in many ways. These chapters alone made the read worthwhile.<br /><br />While there's some good stuff to cherry pick out of A Dance with Dragons and the read was fun for the most part, I reflected on the book afterword and realized not much happened. The major characters that established themselves in A Storm of Swords kind of just stagnate in the same place chapter-after-chapter, while the new characters are thrown into the story without any development or hook, and not much of value has happened by the end of it. In the first three books, Westero's felt like a giant chess board, each major character making a decision was like the pieces moving around the board changing the outcome drastically, but by now it feels like GURM ran out of steam. Seems after killing off a lot of major characters he doesn't know what to do with the ones he has left. I'm just going to admit it: I miss the war of 5 kings.<br /><br />Also why does he insist on cliffhangers now? They were in the prior books sure, but so much has happened prior that it felt like a major set up to the next book. Here, pretty much all you have is the cliffhangers. John, Briene, Cersei, and Daenary's all barely do anything until their final chapters then GURM just stops the book and says to us \\"WILL THE WALL SURVIVE? WHO WILL WIN THE BATTLE OF WINTERFELL? WHAT DID BRIENNE SAY TO CATELYN? AND WILL WOMEN EVER RULE COMPETENTLY?(lol no), TUNE IN NEXT TIME TO FIND OUT!-complete with cheesy organ music in the background. How about instead of saving that s*** for the end and meanwhile writing about food in pornographic detail, GURM fleshes out the story more instead of letting it stagnate. It'll be a real shame if ASOIAF never picks up after these two slumps.RIENNE SAY TO CATELYN?

B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Per ordered this DVD as it was not being released in Australia for another 2 months .  It Came straight away. Great series the intrigue continues with all the fabulous. Cast in this series. Looking forward to season three
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is good but like most say the energy goes too fast and there needs to be more ways to earn diamonds.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I'm not a Gaga stand but I can't stop playing this song! It's really great to work out to! ;-P
B004NSULHM|3.0|Good group, good record, but more on the electronic side.  Ended up only putting 3 of the songs on my I-pod, the rest was just too much for me.
B00C9U9YOW|1.0|Wow this album is flat.  slow uninteresting music with a dreadful off key falsetto as the only set of vocals.  The bigger hommies ego gets the more his work suffers.  He really does need the old band around to bring some gusto and actual rock vocals to this thing but it seems its more important for hommie to have complete control and to hob nob with celebs than to make great music.  too baddd.  I'm thru with it.
B0014NDXGA|4.0|It works really well.  We went through two batteries really fast so hoping they were shipped old and our new one we purchased will last longer.  It is great and easy to focus.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I particularly enjoyed the whole self story of the author's experience behind bars surviving, making friends, learning the ways of prison, and the not to mentions as well as the to mentions.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|For a free Bible app, this one is really good. Easy to browse and easy to set up. I use mine daily on my phone and use it on my Kindle at home.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|My eleven year old grandson wanted to watch these movies that he had always heard about. We spent a wonderful weekend together watching all of them!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I've always loved the sound of Violins, but I've never truly liked classical music. Lindsey Stirling takes a beautiful instrument and sound, and makes it more modern, upbeat, rocking, fresh, and fun. My kids even love her music, one of my daughters has signed up for the Violin in school. Great album to listen to in the car.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Good show, very different story than I was expecting but ended great! Lots of great characters that they mostly explain throughout the season. I would highly recommend watching it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|addictive and fun. enjoying playing everyday. I rate this as an A-onegame to play. there are so many solitaire. games to play but this is the best game ever.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Good story. Weak special effects. Recommend watching it will have you craving more.  I am told,season 2 is even better...
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|A friend recommended this artist after seeing her perform on a morning news program.  I took one listen to the track, \\"That's Alright\\", and I was hooked.  What I'm enjoying about \\"Sing To The Moon\\" is how different it is from what you are currently hearing on the radio.  It's is soulful, classical and very lyrical.  I can hardly wait to see/hear her perform in person.  Here is a clip I found on NPR's Tiny Desk Concert, [...]
0345494768|5.0|Jonny is a big Star Wars buff and was intrigued with the inside story of its filming.  Actually I can't wait to read the book myself.  Getting it for him for his birthday was just a ruse.
630469654X|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies of all time and my Daughter in Law also loved it so it was a small birthday present for her.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I already knew i would love this movie when I first saw the trailer and fell in love with that. But this movie really met my expectations in the best way. It was VERY confusing the first time through though, so you'll definitely want to watch it twice. And maybe read the Wiki article too.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy playing this game but wish there was a place to go for questions about certain terms within the game, for example talisman.
B002PHVHFI|5.0|The album arrived early and sounds really, really amazing. Definitely buying from amazon again for vinyl, and I recommend this album to anyone who wants to try out vinyl.
B000002AH9|5.0|Great, great CD.  I had honestly never liked Billie Holiday's music, until I listened to this CD.  Wow!  Great music.
034580404X|3.0|All of the books start out really slow, and drag on and on. But once you get in to it you can't put it down. So if you have ever heard  someone say that these books are boring they are not it just take time for it to pick up.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I got tired real fast with the author describing everyone's outfits, hair styles.  Not much of a story line...  Trying too hard to be like 50 Shades of Grey.... A book with a lot of nothing
B0085A9HXS|5.0|After having seen this movie I can't really see myself truly enjoying another action movie. This really sets the bar.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I use this application for all my scheduling need, such a small work, doctors appointments, TV premiere schedules, and football games. It has a great interface that fit first time users can be a little challenging but is very easy to get the hang of. I can sync multiple Gmail calendars which is very convenient. The only downfall to pocket informant is that it always adds an alarm to my events even though I select &quot;no alarm&quot; when I input the event. Pocket Informant is a great substitute for the stock calendar app most phones have.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I found &#34;the Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; both to be more gripping than this one.  I wasn't reading enough at a time and it became a little hard to follow.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Wonderful music I play almost every day.  Sometimes I take it and listen to it in my car.  Beautiful songs, some whose words I've known for a long time, though most are sung in a language I cannot understand.  Yet, my heart understands their beauty.
0060763280|3.0|The author stresses to read this book at least once a month and I know why.  There's a lot of info here, but it's really hard to remember it all.  You need to read this book at least twice and take some notes to really grasp what it's all about.  It has many good tips and pointers, and lots of technical info.<br /><br />It's an instructional book, you won't get many personal stories here, just tips.  There's lots of info crammed into such a small book and I do believe that if you read this book at least 3 times, all that info will sink in and will greatly improve your life.<br /><br />I might give it more stars, if I read it again, right now it only gets 3 from me.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I haven't read any fiction nearly this well written and engaging in a very long time. Korea needs a miracle.
B0064W652A|4.0|Great read, great art.  Keeps you in suspense until the very end.  Would rather have actual book and not kindle version.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|great movie good graphics good story great for all ages to watch  a movie you can watch over and over
B00BHMEALA|3.0|For those of us who lived through the hostage crisis, this movie is dated.  If you're paying money for it, know that Ben Affleck's character is historically inaccurate.
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|I don't want to give the impression that this is a bad game,  it isn't.  its only real flaw really sets it back in my opinion : the game ends too quickly. once its over that's it,  there's really nothing else too it, no incentive to keep on playing. like I said though,  it is a very enjoyable game, just maybe not worth the price for the length.
B00C1CO0XS|4.0|I discovered this CD on the music channel of my TV!!!  The song, that they played all of the time was &#34;Unforgetable&#34;!!  I was disappointed, that all of the songs were not up to that standard!!
B00DU761TY|5.0|I love this game I first played it on my nieces ipad and I was hooked. its very easy. to learn how to play it. u have different Colorado sands coming out of these chutes and u have to guide the sand to pour into the correct coordinating funnel at the bottom. you have to make sure u don't mix the Colorado and u need to hurry because before u know it there will be another Color sand pouring out that needs to be guided to a funnel.I got my sister addicted to this game too hahaha. it will keep u entertained and doesn't get boring because u will continue to try to keep beating your top score.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It fun and I love the scene changes are great and it keeps your attention to where you want to keep on playing till you do finish.
B00D6C0D42|5.0|Somehow it's still relevant (if somewhat dated stylistically). Great film that really creates a vibe like nothing I've ever seen before.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I didn't want to watch this movie due to its low imdb rating. But my sister encouraged me to watch it and I'm glad I did.<br />The story is very endearing. I like the tender moments of vulnerability between mother and son.<br />And the ending is not as cliche as you would think.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much more than I anticipated. Initially, I though that this book would be about the  lives  of a few washed  up music types, but was I pleasantly surprised! Egan weaves such an intricate web of characters who have  pasts,presents and futures that are sad, tragic, grossly intertwined, and so close to the  human predicament that I found  myself in the trenches wanting to know more.  Her writing style is so unique and innovative and requires nothing less than a study of language to comprehend. What a refreshing joy to read.
B00ARX2W24|4.0|I was disappointed, that &#34;Puttin' on the Ritz&#34; was not on the CD!!  I was told, that it would!!  i saw him on SYTYCD, and immediately, I wanted to buy the CD with that song on it!!  It did not happen!!
1608199096|5.0|Having just returned from Venice this book was an invitation to re-visit from home.  It sits on my coffee table and I find myself flipping through daily......enjoying the photos and oodling over which recipe to make.  Even the binding and cover of the book are special----with the inner workings of the binding being exposed revealing a very pleasing visual and tactile experience.  The book feels like a treasure from the past......but reading it--- it is very current in its interpretation and combination of flavors.  Simply wonderful.
B00915G6SU|5.0|I love this show. I have all the tapes in each season. So glad there will be a 9th season.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Gameloft has done it again with this amazing mix of split second timing and non stop excitement. I highly recommend this game for all ages and I wish I could give it a thousand stars.
B000FC1D90|4.0|I read this book after hearing it called the first of all the modern English language mystery stories.  It may be that, but you have to read it for the love of the language and the pleasure of the different voices that tell the story.  It is funny the way Austen is funny - subtly.  Collins was a contemporary and friend of Dickens and after reading Tale of Two Cities and this novel back-to-back,  Collin's writing has held up much better over time.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Best time spent..the millenium falcon best weapon everrr..careful runnimg ur credit card into oblivion though the upgrades are cool and easier than pie to buy...dont say i didnt warn u
B003TTCURU|5.0|One of best tv series out there that you can watch again and again! Love Grey's Anatomy. Consider yourself warned once you start you can not stop.
014242613X|5.0|This book is the third installment in the series.  These books are written for children, but adults can also enjoy them!<br /><br />Theodore Boone is a 13 year-old boy.  His parents are lawyers.  Theodore is a normal kid who wants to be a lawyer when he grows up.  To this end, he hangs around the Courthouse, becomes friendly with the judges and their staff, and helps his friends with some of their legal problems, for instance, when they have to appear in Animal Court.<br /><br />The books are very enjoyable and I look forward to reading the next book in this series.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Calming and entertaining at once.  Great for just before bed or over my morning coffee.  Replaying levels to make it in 1 less move keeps me coming back.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This is one of my children's favorite movies.Now my grandchildren love it. It has always been a movie that brings us alittle sadness but lots of joy in the end.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Though the Chromecast works well streaming video. It was a disappointment to find out that it does not stream video from the Chrome Browser on the iphone. Something Google should have been more upfront about
B0053O89IS|5.0|What can I say, I'm a fan... I've got all the seasons so I had to get my hands on this one too...
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Overall I was drawn to the protag, but not until act 2. Then the story begins to unfold. Art direction and soundtrack are top notch. Tom Cruise doesn't disappoint in this. Great addition to any sci-fi geek library.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Surviving abuse is truly a topic for our day.  You'll fall in love with the setting, the characters, and the community of loving, supportive, and curious folks.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Extremely surprise by this movie, watch it, no seriously watch it.<br />The only thing I have to say about it, time well spend !
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love Mahjong anyway you put it. Could play it all day. You could however, change your rating system to be more user friendly
B005GIS1WA|4.0|Being a bird lover (aren't we all?), I felt a comraderie with the bird characters in this movie.  The story is very compelling, and the ending should make you cheer!
B000T46NOE|4.0|I was expecting a stupid kid like movie, yet found interesting adult anecdotes.  Good entertainment.  You might want to try this.
B00CBRH4YU|4.0|Director did a good job to be poetic with very little exposition. This film relies heavily on what is shown, not what is said or explained. This is a visual experience in a visual medium. Ultimately the resolution may have gone over my head but worth a second screening to catch it. Malick is a master and can't wait to see more of his visions.
B00A285OOW|3.0|Sometimes a series can go on for too long. This is one of them. I yawned through most of it.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Excellent! I friggin love this show. And to have it on DVD for my very own is so cool! Like I own a piece of excellent on physical form!
B0015AARJI|5.0|What can i say? it came as expected, i needed one more and it worked. Get it! dunno what more to say.
0452295548|5.0|I recommend this book for anyone. Do not wait until you know someone with stroke. Read the book and understand that stroke patients will improve. They may not go back to 100 percent normal but there is a significant hope for a meaningful life following a stroke. The book will help you deal with stroke patients as well as their families.  i recommend it for doctors and nurses who work in acute stroke centers and who counsel families on decisions related to life and death of their loved ones in the early stages of stroke.

B00AYB1RGG|3.0|What you would expect from an 80's action movie re-hash:<br />- over-the-top action<br />- good fight scenes<br />- thin plot<br />It was entertaining, but certainly not Oscar-worthy
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|I like it!  Not sure why people compare it to Angry Bird's? It's a totally different game. You are a ticked off tennis player hitting a tennis ball at clowns,  cops.... Etc but you try to get as many as you can off the ricochet using one ball.  To me it's different and I enjoy different now-a-days. One can only play so many run/dash games.
B00DPY95D6|5.0|This is an engaging read and starts with the protagonist, Cheryl, representing a young gentleman called Daniel in what should be a simple filing for bankruptcy. But things are rarely, if ever, simple for Cheryl. A slight twist on the case has everyone rooting against her, including the judges! She is stalked, has her cellphone tapped, her car tracked, mail opened and her every movement monitored. It begins to drive her insane. To make matters worse, her love interest, 'Travis,' isn't the best of people to be hanging around with and she quickly finds herself under the influence of drink and drugs.<br /><br />Can Cheryl turn things around and win her case?<br /><br />Loved this courtroom drama and am anxiously awaiting the next instalment...<br /><br />5 Star Read!
B00ESY77LO|5.0|The movie was amazing. It was ending was sad. I'm so glad that they had Leonardo DiCaprio & Tobey Maguire (Spider-Man) in the movie. I love it when Amitabh Bachchan comes in the movie because not of Bollywood stars are famous in Hollywood.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game. I even love squishing the gophers! I get frustrated at it if I can't get par or less but it's very addicting
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|My son who is a commercial pilot recommended this book to me.  I was a young girl during WWII, but even then I felt that under other circumstances, Americans and Germans would have been friends if not at war battling each other.  It gave me an insight into Germans, especially pilots at that time.  I was glad to learn all were not Nazis.  There were times when I was riveted to the story and so glad it ended as it did.  This story is not only a \\"man's\\" book, but a \\"woman's\\" too!  I purchased the Kindle version through Amazon.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|This is just a fun movie!!! The music and dancing make you want to get up on your feet and join in the fun! Not just a kids movie, it is great for the whole family!
B001SGEUNI|4.0|Got this after getting &#34;The Strange Case of...&#34; and it is solid.  I don't like it as well as their second release because it is not as heavy.  Their are some highlights and hell anything with Lzzy Hale singing is worth a listen.  She is amazing!!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I wanted the DVD for myself and will watch it many times.  The music is wonderful and I understand  the music was done live as the film was shot.  This isn't often true.
B000J10EQU|4.0|This was a fairly good film.  I liked the acting.  A fairly good plot.  Plenty of action.  I am happy to have the film in my library.
B00EQUP3Q6|1.0|very big nin fan here, so this is really hard for me....this album is just so wrong (for a classic nin fan), it is hard to find words...basically \\"the problem\\" is that trent reznor now is a changed man compared to the man who created the downward spiral or the fragile, which is really good for him, but i think he shouldn't do nin anymore....look at the soundtrack of the girl with the dragon tattoo, which was just brilliant in my oppinion, but hesitation marks lacks what was found in abbundance within every nin album: soul, passion, emotion....this album is soulless and it sounds like it....
B007EECSFA|2.0|It is for a teenager.  I didn't finish reading it.  I have read three other books by her and enjoyed them.  I liked the fact that there was no bad language in any of them.
B0087ZG7HK|4.0|Jurassic Park the movie gets five stars.  One star deducted for lack on any bonus features on this version.  If you want the extras, go with another release.  If you just want the movie, this will do.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|A fun game full of strategy and patience. On casual bacturia with a few genes inserted, I managed to collect 202 DNA points in the year 2021.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I saw the movie in the theater and I wanted the DVD for myself. You learn a lot about his personality and what a difficult job he had.  Often reminds one of today's trials for presidents.
B00E66QPCG|2.0|At first glance, this appeared to be the holy grail to stock investing. After further testing however, the system reveals itself as taking huge risks for minimal gains.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very different and intriguing premise, but very dark.  Well acted; draws you in.  you'll find yourself still thinking about it the next day...
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book should be required readings for those studying theology.<br />The author well documents his historical perspective and weaves it into a good format for trying to understand the power, balance and evils of religious behaviors.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The script, cast, setting are outstanding! Superb acting, very captivating, TV does not get any better, this is entertainment at its best!
0345529057|5.0|I have been an avid fan of this HBO series.  This is a perfect way to revisit the seasons and reinforce the fact that the dialogue so well matches the author's text.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|A number of the reviews for this watch made me a little skeptical about the purchase. However having worn Seiko since the mid-1960s I decided to make the purchase.<br /><br />The reviewers who wrote saying that this watch is bad are either working for another watch company or just don't know what they are talking about.<br /><br />This watch is exceptional for the price.  As soon as it arrived I set the date and time according to a desktop atomic clock and it is now 1 week later and it is perfectly accurate - no loss or gain in time.  Because it is an automatic I wore it for about 10 hours daily for 3 days and now wear it of and on about 6 hours daily.  It has set not worn for an entire weekend.  The watch has not stopped; proving that the watch reserve power once wound is adequate for at least a weekend. This watch is as good as my other three Seiko watches which each  cost  $300+.<br />Yes, I would purchase this again and I would recommend it to others.
B007V4QLY2|5.0|If you love P!nk then you have to add this to your collection, its fun to hear her progression.  She has always been able to sing.  Great voice and fun.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Sweet a super cool bit of brilliance on a whole new experience a fun easy lot pick up on the controls
B000000WGL|5.0|Used to own this as a cassette. Wore it out & committed it to memory until I had to hear it again. Absolutely a great piece of rock & roll. Thanks again.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|my nephew loved asphalt 7 so i bought this app for him to play...  he really enjoys playing it and could play all day..
B008JFUO4U|4.0|This movie was not at all what I expected, not having seen previews of it beforehand.  The futuristic setting was quite stylistic and the special effects were spectacular.  The story line was somewhat confusing as was the ending, but the action sequences were exciting, even if not realistic.  It does illustrate vast advances in drone technology from what we have today.  Overall a fun escapist movie to watch.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|My wife and I have enjoyed this series, but the ending was poorly written.  The writers need to use a bit more creativity when making major changes to the story.
B001AW156U|3.0|These triggers for PS 3 controllers are not very sturdy for games that require lots of shoulder button presses. And they require you to do some cutting on the inside where it snaps on to the L and R buttons. Maybe its a flaw with just this one, but I'd look for something else.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I thought the book was really good.<br />It is really interesting, funny, and relative. I would read the whole series
1416550534|5.0|Captivating, surprise ending, and very enjoyable.  Great for book club discussion.  Questions found at end of book lead to very deep discussions.
B00932A4XE|3.0|This movie is entertaining which is what Hollywood is all about.  Anyone who has experienced pregnancy can find something of themself in this plot.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|You will Love this album!  Bruno Mars has so much talent it is unbelievable.  If you have not heard him before, this would be the best album to start with.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved, Loved it!  Very captivating hated to put it down.  Continue with the series, it is well worth it.  You will not be let down.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|THIS PRODUCT WAS ACCORDING TO MY NEEDS THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IN THIS ORDER! I ALSO, LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING MORE PURCHASES JUST LIKE THIS ONE.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Expected more action  and drama.  I had to make myself finish it.  Felt like I was wasting my time eavesdropping.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It will b good for my daugther....struggling timing  in going to bed and getting in good mood next morning to go to school.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I like the snap shot of the lives of ordinary Germans during (1939-1944).  The narrator is death and he is busy collecting the fruits of Nazi policies.  The story is heart wrentching.  The characters live on in my mind and heart.
B00006879E|5.0|This is Maroon 5's best album.  This really set them apart and set them up for stardom.  I love this album.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Inspiration for all pirate lovers and haters. Mr. Depp must have read this. it is a great read and never boring.
B00AEBBA72|5.0|love it its awsommmme its truly epic yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay it is the best,ty so much its awsome ty ty ty ty
B0036S4B6M|3.0|This read like a church service witness paper rather than a novel. The character development and better than average descriptions lose their luster and then stop almost all together. If this was a stylistic decision to illustrate Piper's state of mind, it lacked the over exaggeration required for such a tool.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy and entertaining game. I can play for hours without getting bored. I like how I have the option to increase the challenge or play easy sets.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|just seen him live 3 weeks ago , was bummed he talked more then played - like bb king - but his cd's are still just so so damn good & he's got a horn section on most if not all songs .
B0000DCGT0|4.0|This is an all time favorite movie of mine, and I'm happy I have it to watch over and over.
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|Just purchased Kindle 8.9 downloaded and installed Assault 8 and it will not run.  The app starts gets to Gameloft menu and shuts down.
B001OG5I24|5.0|I bought this CD for the song &#34;Black Velvet&#34; as it is a country line dance as well. But the whole CD is good!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I never thought that I would jump on \\"Fifty Shades\\" bandwagon and yet here I am.  I read a lot so I kind of breezed right through this without all that much effort.  There are a lot of repeated phrases that honestly are not even worth repeating through the novel but still continue to pop up like a cold sore.  I only put up with this rather obvious flaw (who was her editor??) was because the story actually seemed to be quite interesting.  It was not so much the sexual relationship that they have together that interested me the most, but how broken they both appeared to be and the attraction - but also resistance - they have towards each other.  I really liked how they left things off things off in almost a cliffhanger.  I actually think I might read the rest of the trilogy, I'm not sure yet.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|i love howls moving castle movie so i just had to buy the book and man its wonderful im planning on buying rest of series soon!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Good read. I enjoyed the second book. The book definitely had some twists. I can't wait to read the next one!
B004BBDHEK|5.0|A touch of brilliance. Yanni never ceases to amaze with his music. You can listen to it during some quiet time or belt it out when you are going for a drive either which way, it's awesome.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very well written book. Its story and execution are amazing. Even though it can be considered a book for a younger audience, it's a bit brutal so I'd recomend it for kids of 11-12 years and older. All in all, I really loved this book! I can see why it has circulated for so long and I'm excited to read the rest of the series!!
0847830942|5.0|Another quality product from the great Jan Heine.  Beautiful pictures, informative writing.  A must for fans of vintage bicycles.  Buy it and enjoy it for years.
B004UPANAI|5.0|great movie, I like how they told the story of wolverine and his beginning. love the whole storyline, great direction also
B001RJQ700|4.0|Cool effect for the time it was made and I'm sure the budget wasn't all that much but pretty cool.
B0091WMSNU|5.0|Well acted, great plot but i wish it had a little better ending.  I would highly reccomend this movie to all my friends.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like playing Mahjong and the options available with this version are fine.  However, when I downloaded it, the game opens upside down and does not respond to changes in the position of my Kindle.  I've tried clearing it from the device and reloading it with the Kindle in a different position and that didn't make a difference. I emailed support for the app but did not get an answer.  The only real reason it matters is because it's more comfortable to hold the Kindle according to the way the cover opens. That means that I can either hold the Kindle less comfortably or play the game upside down which is annoying.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|I watched this on my Kindle and enjoyed it ever so much.  It is a great movie and good on the small screen.
B008JEJOAG|5.0|What can I say ? they are Crocs and fit/ feel great. I like the more aggresive tread and my daughter likes the green.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|Much to complicated to learn to use with the meager help facility available with the application. KISS is definitely called for in these types of applications.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Was able to catch my wife up from the first season. It was great to re-cap! A great way to spend a lazy labor day!
B00AYB0SQQ|5.0|great thriller movie!! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a movie they wont soon forget.!! enjoy it
B00E193TM2|5.0|AWESOME album!!!!!!  Haven't stop listening to it!  Every single track on it completely rocks!  Best Five Finger Death Punch album to date!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved the action, loved the comedy, loved Loki and the Hulk!<br />I've been waiting for years to see this done right. Finally, now maybe they can do one with all of Avengers!
B00CEQ1HQE|5.0|am glad my daughter loves this doll, she likes the way the body parts fall off in play, she loves gross things.
B002OSXDAU|3.0|Although I am learning about architecture, it seems a whole lot of anxious waiting for something to happen. Hmmm, Yet I can't stop reading it.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Fun wish I could transfer my base form my phone or kindle I hate having to use different bases depending on what device I'm using
B00AG473GE|5.0|This is a great movie, with a lot of my favorite actors and actress in the movie, a great film, that is something the family will enjoy, great acting and excellent quality. If you are a Molly Ringwald fan, you need this movie.
0920668372|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book...I buy a copy for all friends and family members who are expecting.  I still cry every time I read it.  A must for new mommies!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is awesome the ability to stream directly from my computer to my TV is great. I know you can do that with Apple TV but I don't have an Apple Computer or iPhone.  I like that I can even use my phone to play Netflix and not tie up my computer to watch a movie or a TV show.<br /><br />Setup was challenging. That is kind of an understatement, I wanted to setup the product in my room that is downstairs from the WIFI router.  I have great reception in my room but apparently it was not consistent enough to complete setup.  But once I moved it closer to the WIFI router I was able to setup the system with no problems.  I was able to move it back to my room and it works great.<br /><br />So all in all a great item, if you are having trouble with setup check to make sure that you are close enough to the WIFI router.
B00CE6E6B2|1.0|Not a real bad game to tiring to have to go get energy not my kind of fun. It is not like Ice Age Village it is real fun deleting this game
B000QUCNOK|3.0|I love the cinematography. There a parts of this film that are a bit intense and things could be clearer, but overall I think it is an interesting movie that is well acted. Plus the red hair is so vibrant it is beautiful.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I've heard people talking about this how for a while, but never really got into it. I guess it was because Claire is in it and I never really remember her from anything significant. I was wrong. She nails this role and really pulls you into her struggle. It's not the usual Bourne action type stuff, but you definitely get hooked, wondering what's going on next. It's great.
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|This album proves the you can sing twelve songs without cussing, sexual content, or a computerized voice. Kids can listen to it, teenagers, and adults - it fits all categories. The album is sweet, classy, and fun. All the songs get stuck in your head - they're so catchy and easy to remember. When I first got the album I thought I didn't like it because it was REAL music. It wasn't computerized or techno or fake which is what I'm used to. No, it's just Ariana Grande's voice with a beat and a piano. I absolutely love it now! It's mature enough for adults but sweet enough for kids. This is the best album you can buy!<br /><br />Honeymoon Avenue  10/10<br />Baby I  9/10<br />Right There [feat.

B001HBYHFA|5.0|There's an abrupt and shocking moment, a fight scene that is a beautiful ballet, and of course the crew of Serenity.  What's not to love?
1455519006|5.0|I can't wait for his next book.  He always holds my interest with a very good plot and interesting people.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|It was very good and a lot of action. When you thought he won then something else would top up, especially when Molly stabbed him at the end. Very Very Good.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|This is a deep and intricate film. Some may think it slow moving, but I find it beautifully filmed and acted. Carey Mulligan is gorgeous and her range of emotion in this film just really moves me.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|it fits perfect with my kindle fire hd i tried to buy something that was not made by amazon sent it back.  if you want the best buy the best
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|The game is great, but you should be aware that the higher levels you get to, buying most attractions for the park requires real money since earning bucks is too rare of event to afford most of them. Other than that, very nice.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As the story and characters gain depth, you get drawn even deeper into the lives at Downton Abbey.  This is well worth anyone's time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really loved  this book.  Finished it in a day.  I just could not put it down.  Excellent! I would recommend this, you won't be disappointed....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think this calculator works great ,and is so convenient to have on my kindle fire . I really enjoy having it. Makes math easy .
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn had me from the moment I opened the book -- and she had me guessing all the way. The reader's love-hate relationship with the story's main characters, Nick and Amy, is brilliantly maneuvered by Flynn, and her thrilling exploration of a mystery and a marriage give the reader a front row seat to into their relationship. If you haven't read this book, you are in for a treat. don't wait another minute!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 2 yr old and I play this and love it<br />Even  though we don't use the in app purchasing.<br />She loves grooming and looking at the other. Optional horses.
B000OB5UU0|5.0|I liked this movie. If you love Metallica, this movie is a good watch. I found it interesting to see the trials the band went through during that time. A well done documentary.
B00D3ZJB1S|1.0|When I ordered the cd I was expecting a t-shirt with it. for 25 bucks and no t-shirt ! come on.I could of bought the same cd for under $15
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is fun and challenging. My son got me hooked. He is a good player and we both like it a lot. A must have
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game cant get enough of it i could play for hours<br />It is better than the ones in the arcade
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I did not really care for this,I usually don't like games but decided to try it.But won't be playing again.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This movie is amazing! For any of you out there who like the TOME episodes online, you will love this movie. It was a gift from my mother, and I was so excited when it came. :D
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was truly an eye opener to the ways of our country before civil rights were instituted for all people. A fascinating but also sad read. I didn't want to put it down.
B008JFUPOY|4.0|I'm an adult and saw this movie with a group of other adults just for fun. I loved it because even though the characters are monsters it has a real college feel to it. All the elements of a college are there - moving in, awkward roommate situations, people splitting off into stereotypical groups. It's very cleverly written. I especially like how the fraternity the main characters are in is the antithesis of what a stereotypical fraternity is.<br />I found this funnier than the original. That being said, I don't know if this would be as big a hit with young kids. There isn't anything inappropriate in this movie, and it has a good message but I think younger kids might not appreciate all of the college jokes. Still, it has familiar monsters so kids might like it anyway.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like the info it provides on the main screen.  Easy to add locations.  I use it  a lot .
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This is such a great app, very fast and easy to use I really recommend this for people who need YouTube  TRY IT
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is an addictive game. Time flies when you are playing it. Definitely makes idle time speed by and keeps you busy.
B00B22ASUM|3.0|quick read.  Amusing story.  Felt like the story ended too soon.  Would have liked to know more about Bob and his new owner.  No pictures either.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Yep. Spooky fun plus a monkey, all for a buck. THANKS OBAMACARE.<br /><br />No, really, universal health care for the win.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Enjoy using this dongle very much.  Getting use to it was easy and setting it up was even easier. Havihg a lot of fun with it.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Its a fun game to play with the grand kids. I like the  graphics and the old witches in the game.
B0040HO16S|5.0|Yet another \\"British Invasion\\" series from British television. Lark Rising is a rural hamlet 8 miles (or thereabouts) away from a prosperous little town, Candleford. The story centers around Laura Timmins, eldest daughter of a stonemason in the hamlet, who is sent to work for Dorcas Lane, the Candleford postmistress. There are plenty of vivid characters, Lord Timothy, who seems to be in love with Dorcas as well as his neurotic wife Lady Adelaide. Laura's family (her father is played by the wonderful Brendan Coyle from \\"Downton Abbey\\"--he played Mr. Bates the valet), and the rest of the ensemble cast is delightful.<br /><br />The only weak spot is Laura herself. Either it's the script or actress Olivia Hallinan, but this ingenue role is bland and boring in comparison to all the wonderful characters surrounding her. It's not easy to play the \\"straight man\\" and I'm afraid Miss Hallinan doesn't have the acting chops to stand up to such a crowd with a difficult role to play. I go to sleep when she's on the screen. However, that doesn't stop me from enjoying yet another Victorian era costume drama from Great Britain. And it's a Prime offering, meaning Prime subscribers can download it with no additional charge. Good stuff.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you haven't seen this show, get it. Though I would say you also have to get the movie serenity because there is only one season of firefly and the movie rounds out the end of the show nicely.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|this Cd introduced me to specific Hawaiian musicians and to some of the most beatiful music I've ever heard.When I first listened to it, I knew this was the music I'd been looking for. sit back, have a cocktail and go into the wonderful world of sound these people have created.Close your eyes and you are in Paradise!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Finally - a validation from a true scientist that there surely is life after death, a loving Father, and an actual heaven.  Very technical at times, but that makes it even more impactful!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Mahjong looks easy, but is a constant  challenge. Keeps me coming back to better my time to complete a puzzle..
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love how well-made it is; however, It has gotten a bit too gloomy for me. The BBC always has beautiful period pieces and I hope they keep doing it.  Can't wait for Season 4.
B00ENYKBD0|4.0|This was my third time viewing this movie. I enjoyed it very much. Being a Cryptographer during the cold war brought back some memories, although some of the Cryptography part of Beautiful Mind is kinda fictional. And so is some of the Bipolar part. I know I suffer from this illness, the modern medications are the only thing that keep me on track. The film shows how now patients with this illness fair much better today.<br />I would recommend this film to anyone interested in gaining insight as to how one copes in life with this illness
B0071XO8RA|5.0|there are several other reviews here that do it better justice than I could. Just read it. You won't regret it.
B008CX2A2I|5.0|works great just wish onkyo would have let you put it in the back wow what a idea it would still work and be out of the way if you put it in the back you will burn out both usb ports and the net services onkyo will tell you this if you do this
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It's similar to Mario so if u like Mario u will like this. Works well no problems. Easy download even kids enjoy it.
B00005T30L|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. There are no scratches on the disk so I give it 5 stars.
0762434279|5.0|A must read for every child! Wish I had this knowledge growing up! Robert Kiyosaki simplifies it all, anyone can understand!
B005I6EU48|5.0|my friends always got weirded out seeing a leather-bound book charging. It fits the KindleFire perfectly and looks like a very expensive book when closed. The hammered gold leaf on the leather has a quality texture to it, and the cover may not be leather, but it feels like good, sturdy material. I was forever telling my husband not to fold the front cover over to the back when he played his games on the Kindle because it would crease the spine, but despite him doing this it maintained its appearance.<br /><br />Well worth the money, if you want a Kindle to look like a hardcover book.
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|This music soundtrack is excellent. Highly recommend it to soundtrack collectors. Looking forward to more m83<br />music. Didn't know what to expect, highly satisfied.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My ten year old son and I both loved this book. This was our favorite one of the whole summer by far.
0300169787|5.0|Great book for the coffee table. Must have for McQueen fans. I've had it a year and still love it.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It is fun. You can learn how to operate many wwii weapons. I think I could use the m1carbine and the 1903.
B008JFUO36|4.0|i would have rated 5 stars except the disk skipped a couple times and i have a brand new disk player.  Whoever the mass producer is does a poor job.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My 2 month old has taken a pacifier since day 1 (almost a necessity for falling asleep), but we've always struggled with how to keep it in. His suck reflex is consistent with what he does on the breast so he pushes out some and doesn't just suck, resulting in a pacifier that would fall out every two seconds.  Our solution was to fold a burp cloth into a strip and then tuck the cloth around his chin/shoulders and the pacifier, holding the pacifier in place.  He could always push the paci out when he wanted to and it never covered his face tightly.  However, this was a pain in the butt and I was always a bit worried about the cloth covering the face too tightly (SIDS paranoia, anyone?).<br /><br />We got the Wubbanub today.  It was smaller than I expected (I was thinking beanie baby size) so I didn't think it would work too well.  I was also thinking it would be easier for him to grab when older, but he doesn't grab much right now so I wasn't holding my breath.  I thought he'd still just push it right out.  Well, I was wrong.<br /><br />We tried it for nap time, and....AMAZING! It didn't fall out at all.  I am watching a sleeping baby with a pacifier in his mouth, with no rigged up burp cloth contraption  to hold it there.  I'm in love.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Love the concept of using great acting with realistic character representation. The portrayal of the modern media reflects reality.What does Tommy know?
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|It was pretty bloody, a lot of action, but it was good. I wasn't sure if I would like it or not, but I would give it a &#34;thumbs up!&#34;
B0091X2K0A|5.0|This is a awesome classic if you love war movies and what soldiers have to go through in basic training you will love the drill instructor and what he has to say to the troops - not for the kids
B002SSUQFG|4.0|It's not exactly a sports watch, but I like it because it is less dressy than a metal or leather band.  The instructions say to pull out the stem to the 3rd click to set the time but this watch doesn't do that - must be bad instructions.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|When you see the title, you think this is going to be about a husbands secret involving the usual affair or other woman. I was pleasantly surprised to see the plot so different, so well written, with a tinge of wit I enjoyed.  Excellent read - romance with a twist!
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I wish they had used more of Austen's own dialogue. Otherwise, it was a delightful production. Romola Garai was perfect, if just a bit too modern, as was Jonny Lee Miller.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I read the first book then went immediately to the second! I started reading and couldn't set the book down. It took me one day to read, which is something I just don't do often. I highly recommend reading this book, but be prepared to buy the next book after this one.
B00COHIFQS|1.0|Very disappointed I was really looking forward to seeing this movie not scary at all more like a kids scary story reminds me of a scooby doo show ha but not worth the money It sucks
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Always been a fan of this seemingly nutty but nice guy.  Love his music for all time.  Today's yelling and screaming stuff will never measure up to our Rod Stewart.  Loved him young and a little silly but adore him now!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was REALLY REALLY good! It is one of my favorite books now! I think everybody should read this book!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great graphics... fast paced game with multiple characters to choose from.  My grandkids love this game and they play more than I do.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Banana......<br /><br />Love the game and the movies...my niece does too<br /><br />Fun fun fun...wish there was different levels though it gets boring doing the same run over and over
B005KLN056|5.0|I first watched this concert on hdnet  just knew i had to buy it on blu ray this inconcert on dvd is freaking  AWESOME both video & sound quality slash & myles f'n rock ! well worth the $ of the blu ray ..
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Great beginning, then got somewhat confusing in the middle of novel with many different characters and story lines. The ending was good too.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Either there is just something I'm not getting.... but I've been using Google for years and I can't get this app to work. I un-installed it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I knew it was form the pic but it proved to be better I had it for ds and it was superb until I found out that it was android and I instantly wanted to get it even though I already owned for ds
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This movie was pretty darn close to the book.  I gave it a four star because the movie did not give a clear background of the father dying, the meaning of the mocking jay. It was a good watch and I look forward to the second and third movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the best games in the app store! The minions are so funny! I am glad I got this fun game.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is awesome I love the graphics!! Can't wait till the next one comes out!!!!! I definitely recommend this game to anyone .
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I only read the three top reviews and saw some craziness about this being a ripoff of angry birds (or some such nonsense). This is obviously a Stupid Zombies ripoff, not an angry birds ripoff. Still, it's AWESOME! A ton of fun, great storyline. I think it's a blast.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The series is great. I actually started watching Dr. Who because it's the same director who's doing them now created this series. Problem is that there are so few episodes and so much time in between seasons. But at least the episodes have all been great.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called &#34;Ten Rings&#34; in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists. I believe that this Iron Man is original, but that is my opinion. I rate this movie 10/10.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As always when Mr. Gaiman, tells a tail it's enchanting. I loved every moment of it. He always leaves me wanting more.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It helps me a lot with my homework so everyone out there no body loves it more than me so goodbye
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I'm really impressed with this game. It is not overly difficult like some fighting games (in fact, it is dead simple), the graphics are decent for mobile, the game play is responsive and fluid and I find no bugs. The game lets you play it but you still need skills to rock the statistics. As a FAOTD this is a must have. For $3? Hmm... well that depends on how much you like games like this. I personally would not pay that much. It feels a bit high to me. Regardless, good game!
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|This was an awesome movie to watch especially with the whole family. everyone was glued to the tv til it was done
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|The people giving this bad reviews must have not watched the same movie.<br /><br />IRON MAN 2 was as good as it gets for superhero movies. It is a well-built story using characters and situations dating back to the 1960's. (Hence the nice addition of Tony Stark's dad in filmstrip sequences). The rivalry between him and a cold war Russian inventor plays out a generation later between Tony and the inventor's son, a character known as Whiplash (but never actually called that in the movie). I have to say the writing was top-notch and the characters excellently portrayed. For any armchair psychologists out there, the child-rearing theory of nature vs. nurture surfaces in Whiplash' origin. The young boy grew up in a climate of hate, and well, this is what happens. OK, getting too deep, more on the fun stuff...<br /><br />Paltrow as Virginia \\"Pepper\\" Potts, the director as \\"Happy\\" Hogan, and Rockwell as Justin Hammer all did a great job. Mickey Rourke dialed it down a notch and was superb. You will get some laughs from Favreau, functioning mostly as a chauffeur. Adding in the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) was a stroke of genius. Her fight sequence deserved applause! A nice touch: her decorative belt rings (first seen in Spiderman issue #86, 1970) became her weapons. Very cool!<br /><br />This film is great fun, balancing character development, science (best invention - Hammer's \\"Ex-wife\\" missile), thrills, politics and laughs. Highly recommended.
B005DWBO0K|5.0|Given this is a foreign film created in the 1920s, I thought the story and cinematography were quite good.  I'd even consider watching it again at a future date.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|I think that the app worked perfectly and it is Amazeballs and I recommend if for everyone!!!!!!!!!!! And I must say I have jade lots of fun on this app.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I know Amazon is new to this digital delivery thing, so I'll cut them some slack. Their customer service has been wonderful, but that doesn't change the fact that there is no consistency or communication regarding what should be a weekly on-time thing. Episode five had issues queueing, and now episode six is not available (Because of Memorial Day? What, people don't watch TV on holidays now?) apparently until next week. This means that we'll be a week behind on viewing, which on the internet with its now now now spoiler culture is a virtual eternity.<br /><br />I predict that Amazon and iTunes will notice a sizable drop in purchases of the next two episodes as fans find *alternative* sources. Which is sad, because I'm more than willing to pay for a timely well-produced product. When I am made to wait for no other reason than some conglomerate's ephemeral distribution contracts, I say screw copyright law, I'm getting it somewhere else.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Someone needs to explain the deeper meaning to this story. After all that .... ? Uh, no. Felt a bit cheated. An engaging tale to be sure, but in the end, just not uplifting.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It had a great story line but the realization of every obstetrical he went through it was  a lesson  of survival. Loved it. I missed it at the theater, so glad I could get it on Kindle.
B008220D7S|1.0|Others have already rated this movie;  my rating is for the misleading comments on the DVD version in this Blu-Ray+DVD+Digital Copy+ Ultraviolet package.  I do not own a blu-ray player, so I bought this disc package solely to get an unrated version of the movie on DVD.  The Blu-Ray is unrated, but the DVD in this set is rated R, not unrated as the package claims.  THIS IS A RIP-OFF.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Other apps allow you to level up quicker without spending real money. And. It seems that the screen sensitivity is weak- you have to touch it sometimes multiple times to gather various items and at times it causes you to lose points in the game.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|love love love  love them. Quite an enjoyable and terrific series.  Hugh Laurie and  Stephen Fry are magnificent. Highly recommend.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Hated just hated to see it go but it was on a very long time.......love Colin Ferguson's character very much.
B008D30K7E|5.0|Hard to compare it to any other book I've read before, and I mean that in the best possible way!<br />Brilliant characters, insane story lines and hilarious one liners.<br />So much fun to read! Highly recommended.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|truly hard to put down! great retake of an arcade classic from way back when. the upgrades really pull it together
B003G4W49C|4.0|I just recently rediscovered the sci-fi genre and found Ender's Game an enjoyable read. The anti-bullying message explains why EG was found in the young adult section in our local library. Time and again Ender serves the bullies their just desserts. While somewhat predictable at times, there are enough surprising twists to keep the reader well engaged. The emotional and physical maturity of Ender and some of the other main characters would have been more believable if they had been four or five years older from the onset, however this does not adversely effect the story.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|got this app for my iphone then my kindle.  good way to help the time go by<br />I would recommend this for any age group.

1781162646|5.0|While I wish there was an electronic version of this book, since I love my Kindle, Thank You Mr. King for bring me back to book land!  Ok, this was a hit, classic ghost story and who done it meets coming of age story. I which it would have lasted longer. I wasn't expecting this tale. I  think I jumped into this as a true crime book, I was pleasantly surprised. In a way, it echoed The Body (Stand By Me) in many ways. If you are looking for a good read with a little of everything, this is it.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|i really liked this cd, I would buy it in the future, it is a great cd for just relaxing.

0321934318|5.0|Another well-done guide by Scott Kelby and his crew.  When complemented by Kelby's live LR5 training seminar conducted by Matt Kloskowski and Adobe's Classroom In A Book for LR5, a complex post-processing software package is clarified and simplified.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|So its a BluRay. The move is one of the best to come out in a long time. Since my review is late I can say that it blew Iron Man 3 out of the water. I buy few physical discs anymore and rely on digital but when I want the full feel of a movie you must get physical media.
B008476HBM|5.0|If you're looking for a book to calm your nerves before bedtime, this will do the trick.  I was very glad to read it on my Kindle, because of the Kindle feature that lets you look up definitions as you read.  I felt my vocabulary expanding as I went along.  The story itself is pretty mundane (thus good bedtime reading), but the characters and historical setting, convey an amazing sense of how society functioned when this book was written.  Probably one reason it is considered a classic.....

B0088WJQ1G|5.0|The movie, Once, introduced me to Glen Hansard and his powerful music.  He sings with such passion and reality...you feel the music...his pain, his excitement.  I am now a huge fan.
0375869026|3.0|Here's a book you just have to like for its feel-good story and important message.  Fifth-grader Auggie Pullman has been born with a severe facial deformity, one that has required many surgeries.  Previously home-schooled, his family enrolls him in a private middle-school in New York City, and that's where the story begins.<br /><br />Not many people can say how a child like Auggie feels to be so disfigured, to be stared at, made fun of, and worse.  He has felt it all, yet he remains remarkably upbeat, even when he's sad.  Palacio does a nice job presenting Auggie's character, through his own words.  She continues the story through other characters' narrations, giving us a wider perspective.  Most interesting of these points of view is that of his older sister, Olivia, who has always loved and protected her brother, but begins to push away from that role.  She is someone who has lived in the background at home, with necessary attention being given to her brother.<br /><br />There are some stereotypical characters meant to underscore the author's message.  Julian the bully, Summer, the good-hearted friend, and Jack Will, whose character is the most developed of August's friends.  Jack is an on-the-fence kind of friend who is forced to choose between the popular kids and Auggie.<br /><br />This is not a complicated story.  The characters are simple, the plot somewhat predictable and the ending is neatly tied.  I think it's important to try to read this from a fifth-grade point of view because that is the intended reader.  I don't think it is meant to be completely realistic because its overall message of kindness would be lost to the reader if presented in the messier world of middle school, high school and parent dynamics.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed, however, that Olivia's story was not developed more.  I think there's the potential to write a great deal about the sibling who has to grow up with less attention.  In addition, I read a review on Amazon that suggested Julian's point of view would have been interesting to read.  I agree with that, but maybe the author thought it would make the book too negative.<br /><br />Someone else commented that there are two kinds of children's books:  the kind that are meant to entertain and the kind that send a moral message.<br /><br />If you're not sure which one Wonder is, Mr. Tushman, the school principal, caps the story with this:  Quoting J. M. Barrie in The Little White Bird, he tells the children, \\"Shall we make a new rule of life...always try to be a little kinder than is necessary?\\"<br /><br />Personally, I like messier, complicated stories, but I'm not a kid anymore...suggested Julian's point of view would have been interesting to read.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|Nothing is too out of reach for those who don't spend money on the game and the mini games make the waiting fun!
030758836X|5.0|This has to be one of the most engrossing books I've read this year.<br /><br />It was painful to follow the long, slow simmer from infatuation to disconnect to drifting to unsettling to anxiety through the full-on boil of this relationship. Your perception of the characters shifts with each passing page, leaving you wanting to give each the benefit of the doubt, then realizing that, once again, there's more going on here than you thought.<br /><br />Like several other reviewers, I have mixed feelings about the ending. I guess it was inevitable, given the foreshadowing. Still, a great read!
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|This movie was just depressing.  We thought it was going to be &#34;Knocked Up&#34; or &#34;Superbad&#34; and instead it just seemed mean.  A lot of screaming, a lot of regret, a lot of confrontations, and a lot of underlying resentment.<br /><br />It had funny momements, but not funny enough to replace the overall tone and feel of the movie<br /><br />We didnt even finish it.
0345803507|5.0|I admit i have read some &#34;trashy&#34; books meaning the sexual content, but this is almost shocking at times. But it is hard to put down. I am starting book 3 & i hope Ana can help Christian become the man, husband, father he wants to be but still enjoy a fulfilling sexual life doing whatever makes them comfortable & satisfied. I love this book & it is in no way &#34;trashy&#34; but refreshing & very enjoyable!

B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It requires a little strategy to get rid of all the buttons. Another reviewer mentioned an issue with game circle. I didn't have the problem, but I think I have the game circle option turned off in my kindle app settings. When I complete a game, I just get a score and a time and move on to the next game. Get the game. It's fun.

B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I do not often take the time to write a review, but for Trent Reznor's new album, I just have to heap my praise SOMEWHERE. The genius of this album is the way it envelops you in its emotion, forcing you to look deep into the abyss.. and, boy, the abyss sure does look back into you! It is dark, moving and powerful. With each play through of this album, the more I appreciated the complexity and profound depth of the music. Trent has succeeded in creating something that is beyond today's music; it is, quite simply, worthy to be called a work of art.

B004X80QNG|4.0|I have been using Pocket Informant for a while and every time I get a new device, I go right back to it. I like having the ability to manage all my PIM stuff in once place and have one consistent interface across all my devices. The software has its quirks, but is overall a winner.<br /><br />For the people complaining about the interface being different, it's because your device is using the phone interface. You can force it to the (pictured) tablet interface by going to Settings --&gt; Application and scrolling down. Just tick the box for &quot;Use tablet UI&quot; and restart the app. Beautiful interface you were promised.
B001NA6096|5.0|Sometimes realistic dialogue is boring and sometimes engaging. This is engaging. Loved Hawke and Delpy. One of those brief, intense romantic experiences made more exciting by a European setting. This could happen to you.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I am a fan of Ken Follett.  This is the third of his epics I have read.  Pillars of the Earth and Fall of Giants are the other two.  I seldom attempt to read a book of more than 400 pages because, with all the interruptions in my life, I lose track of the characters and the plot before I get to the end.  However, Follett's epics are a set of stories set in different places and they come together (almost) at the end.  So it is easier to keep track of characters and consequently, the epics are easier to read on a busy schedule.  .<br /><br />Winter of the World picks up on the theme of the first book, Fall of Giants, and follows the lives of key sets of characters in each of the major combatants of WWII (Germany, Britain, US and USSR) except Japan.  Mostly, these characters are children of the characters in the first book and mostly these characters are on the fringes of the centers of power in each of the 4 countries.  This allows Follett to blend in the political issues facing each of the combatants.<br /><br />Although I was well aware of the atrocities of the Nazis, Winter of the World describes what it was like to live in Germany at the time.  Conditions in the Soviet Union under Stalin were not much better.  I developed great empathy for some of the characters--in particular Carla in Germany and Daisy and Lloyd in Britain. Carla, like her mother before her, show great fortitude and creativity in avoiding the Nazis.  The American characters are a little more difficult to fully understand and I felt less attached to their fates.<br /><br />Looking back, I think that the parts of the book that really captured my heart and imagination were the ones where a powerless individual had to confront danger from a powerful oppressive system or individual.  Follett is a master at creating suspense and surprise under these kinds of conditions.  These roles fell mainly to the Brits and the Germans.  Overall, I think Follett's first epic, Pillar's of the Earth does a better jobof creating suspension and tension throughout the book.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|Max Brooks sets the highest standard for Z fiction. He always does his homework and this book, like World War Z, has a very 'real feel' to it. As the title suggests, for the beginning ~75-80% of the book, it is first a guide (so don't expect a story line or characters). The last ~20-25% of it, similar to WWZ, is a collection of chronological anecdotes from 'historic' outbreaks. Well-done, Mr. Brooks.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|thought this game would be way easy but its harder than i thought it would be! still very fun and a great way to make a boring day fly by!!

B00AAQHP66|5.0|Chasing Mavericks 5★♥<br /><br />This is based on the true story of American surfer Jay Moriarity.  So this film is more about Jay and his mentor, Frosty (Gerard Butler) than it is about surfing.  The film was really good.  A great sports film and very inspirational.  It showed how, at a young age, Jay has a passion for big waves (\\"Mavericks\\").  The setting is the Santa Cruz, California (Northern California) and during the height of El Ni&ntilde;o in 1994.  I always thought you'd have to be crazy to surf those 30 feet waves.  Jay was barely 16 years old.<br /><br />This film doesn't just center around the quest to surf the \\"Big Wave Mavericks\\" (like Laird Hamilton's Riding Giants - which I thought was a good documentary).  Chasing Mavericks ended up being a bit of a tear-jerker for me.  It was also an adrenalin rush (watched it about a half hour ago and I still feel a little rush).<br />But I think that's because I'm really drawn to water sports and just the ocean period.  I've lived in Southern California all my life.  I was body surfering in the 90's before it was popular.  Now, I miss doing that, but still try to get some swim time in either the pools or beaches.  I love the feel of the push-pull of the waves.<br />There are few surfering movies that I like. And now, I think [[ASIN:B00AAQHP66 Chasing Mavericks]] and [[ASIN:B00CPTUMUW In God's Hands]] are my favorite NON-documentary surfing movie.  Meaning a film that is built more on the characters, than the sport.  Sure there are lots of good documentary surfing films to watch.  But I like Docu-dramas more.<br /><br />The soundtrack was very nostalgic for me. A early 90's best of soundtrack.<br /><br />I chose to watch this movie because 1) I'm still waiting for the movie Rush, 2) this is one of those films where the actors does their own stunts.  In this case, Gerard and other actors showed some good Big Wave surfing capabilities. And I didn't know until one interview, that Gerard had nearly drowned and was hospitalized during the production of the film.  So, yes, surfing is a very dangerous sport.talized during the production of the film.  So, yes, surfing is a very dangerous sport.

159420411X|3.0|Review of Silver's \\"The signal and the noise\\" by Paul F. Ross<br /><br /> Nate Silver won acclaim for forecasting correctly the outcome for 49 of 50 states during the US presidential election of 2008 (Obama vs McCain), added to his reputation for success as a political forecaster by forecasting, in August 2010, the outcome of 34 of 36 seats being contested for the US Senate in November 2010.  In June 2012 Silver's FiveThirtyEight blog forecast Obama as winner over Romney in the US Presidential election, describing the victory based on projected electoral college votes, and indeed that was the November 2012 outcome.  Silver has served as statistician and political forecaster for The New _____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Silver, Nate  The signal and the noise: The art and science of prediction  2012, Penguin Books Ltd., London, UK, v + 534 pages<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />York Times where he worked at the time he wrote The signal and the noise.  An announcement from ESPN in July, 2013 indicated that Silver has taken the role of editor-in-chief of www.FiveThirtyEight.com , a service newly acquired by ESPN.<br /><br /> In The signal and the noise Silver treats the task of predicting the future in the contexts of politics (Chapter 2), the career performance of new players in professional baseball (Chapter 3), weather forecasting (Chapter 4), earthquake prediction (Chapter 5), economic predictions (Chapter 6), the spread of infectious disease (Chapter 7), chess playing (Chapter 9), poker playing (Chapter 10), the stock market (Chapter 11), climate (Chapter 12), and terrorist attacks (Chapter 13).  He uses Chapter 1 to introduce his book, Chapter 8 to introduce the reader to Reverend Thomas Bayes, 1702-1761, whose probabilistic way of thinking about predictions is at the heart of what Silver seeks to teach to forecasters.  Silver uses his concluding chapter to encapsulate his message.<br /><br /> Along the way, Silver seeks to teach some important lessons about forecasting.  One is \\"think probabilistically\\" (p 61).  Another is over-fitting one's statistical model to noisy data is a frequent mistake in the forecasting business and only reduces the accuracy of the forecast (p 163).  Making and testing predictions in order to learn about one's errors and how to improve one's forecasts (mentioned several places including p 452) is a good idea.  Beginning with many hypotheses (reaching for the \\"unknown unknowns,\\" p 420) is a good idea.  These notions appeal to this reviewer as good advice.<br /><br /> This behavioral and management scientist learned to check his forecasting methods against actual outcomes while in training in the 1950s.  It was well known at that time that \\"over-fitting\\" one's statistical model to noisy data produces a model which, when the model is tried for its forecasting accuracy on new data, will cause predictions to shrink significantly below first findings in forecasting accuracy.  Thus repeating a forecasting method at least once using new data was expected for best-practice-in-science, applied or theoretical ... these precautions being in hand half a century ago.  Bradley Efron of Stanford (2013) introduces us to the history of approval, then disapproval, approval again, then more disapproval of Reverend Bayes' thought processes within the fraternity of statisticians in the two and a half centuries since Bayes introduced his method for refining our \\"prior\\" (guessed) probabilities with respect to the likelihood of an event.  Efron acquired his knowledge of Bayes' methods through teaching those methods to university students (2010) and, in his thought processes and advice to researchers, is more \\"frequentist (Fischerian)\\" than \\"probabilist (Bayesian)\\" ... as are most statisticians.  Kahneman (2011) illustrates the flaws and possible corrections for universal human thought processes.  Patterson (2010), Fox (2009), and Taleb (2004) have warned us that stock markets can be random and that statistical models - inadequately thought through and tested - can lead investors into disastrous decisions.  Blinder (2013) competently reviews the multiple contributions that produced the 2007-2009 collapse of the US economy, no small part of that outcome following from all-but-deliberate institutional blunders in understanding the probabilities for unwanted events.  Schmidt and Cohen (2013), building on Google's experience and experience in forecasting events influencing international relations, are well aware of the problems associated with \\"big data,\\" more data than can be absorbed.  Tetlock (2005), whose work is frequently cited by Silver as Sliver writes The signal and the noise, described the nonsense that political forecasting can be.  Valiant (2013) would have us believe that mathematical algorithms can absorb \\"new data\\" and lead us toward \\"probably approximately correct\\" insight into relationships tying what we see now to likely future outcomes ... Valiant, a computer technologist, reporting his work with no knowledge base from psychology, a discipline that has studied how humans learn for the past century and a half and learned a good bit about when people learn, when people don't learn, and when people forget.<br /><br />Does Silver integrate and conceptualize this variety of knowledge so that future forecasts in many fields can be better made?  No.  Does he teach the reader how to distinguish forecasts that can be trusted from those that should be dismissed?  Not particularly.  Silver does understand correctly that every forecast, no matter the field or the method, does need to be reported showing a range of likely outcomes and the statistical probability that the actual outcome will fall outside the reported range ... noting correctly that news media and even scientific journals frequently overlook this essential requirement.<br /><br /> Working for The New York Times, traveling from prediction center to prediction center as a journalist does while gathering material for this book, one expects Silver to write well.  He certainly tells some interesting stories.  But writing fine sentences and paragraphs is not his first strength ... and his editors seem to have given him too little help.<br /><br /> Silver's stories all originate in prediction efforts based in US practice and experience.  There is a larger world out there.<br /><br /> As the list of references here shows, there are more than a few recent tales about how forecasts fail.  We can see the recent successes that Silver has experienced in political forecasts ... and that recommends him to the reader as an adviser about how to identify a trustworthy forecast.  His advice, if you can sift it from his presentation, is middling.  His stories illustrate nicely some of challenges in forecasting.  No mathematical background and no probabilistic fundamentals are needed to read and enjoy Silver's book.<br /><br /> The missing ingredients in this work by Silver are (a) illustrations about how valid forecasts can improve decision-making (I was describing those probabilities to management audiences in 1960 ... and having absolutely no effect on the way decisions were being made ... the audience being totally unprepared to understand and use the information ... and this at Boards of Directors levels in world-class, globally-oriented corporations), (b) integration of the forecasting literature for the general reader (someone needs to do this ... Silver hasn't done it here), and (c) understanding and describing persuasively the immense challenge presented by a general population and a continuing stream of leaders who have learned nothing of probabilistic thinking and statistics in elementary, secondary, or university education.  We need that education as a society so that we can \\"change course\\" and learn to use forecasts, already available, for the benefits they can bring to society.  We behavioral and management scientists have long been able to make much more accurate predictions (about human behavior) than Silver has discovered and presented to us.  Our societies spend important sums and much time understanding and using weather predictions, using orbital mechanics to push satellites to landings on the Moon and Mars, understanding and inhibiting the spread of infectious disease.  We are just now introducing computerized medical record keeping accessible to all our health care providers, and to us, although computers have been widely used in business for at least three decades.  Why aren't we using predictions about human life outcomes already technologically in hand?  I have demonstrated how to do it, and have tried unsuccessfully to publish the news, that productivity in science can be increased fourfold or more at no increase in the current cost of doing science ... but none of the ten or so peer reviewed journals of science and general journals I have approached have been willing to publish the findings.  Why?  Because editors do not know enough to know that the findings are feasible and peers are not responsible enough to look at the evidence, evaluate it, and insist with editors that the report be published.  It is not that we humans cannot learn.  It is that we choose not to learn.  I recently have begun to call it the \\"Won't Learn Syndrome.\\"  Silver understands correctly that the-state-of-the-technology with respect to forecasting needs to be articulated for an audience of `leaders and the well educated' since those audiences have much to learn.<br /><br /> It is possible to learn as a culture, as a society ... as Pinker (2012) so helpfully teaches us with a sweeping look at the history of violent behavior by humans.  Pinker presents data-based arguments persuasively showing that humans are becoming less violent.  Few believe him ... Pinker's evidence be damned.  Learning ... making progress in individual and societal performance ... need not take the nearly one hundred centuries it has taken to reduce people's violent behavior.  Humans have invented science and science is teaching us how to learn ... if only we would learn.  A frequentist's prediction that \\"we won't learn\\" is virtually certain to be accurate.  The Bayesian prior probabilities that we won't learn are about 0.9999 plus or minus about 0.0001.  The challenge is that it need not be that way.<br /><br />Bellevue, Washington<br />6 September 2013<br /><br />Copyright © 2013 by Paul F. Ross.

0340935804|5.0|this was the best Jodi book I've read thus far! I was very happy with it. I would definitely recommend it.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Great graphics, amazing sound effects--court sounds, score keeping (even in French!!).  There are enough game options to keep the play varied & interesting without automatically being forced to &#34;buy in&#34; (cashing in tennis balls) to other levels (although I admit to buying into a first round US Open match against Serena Williams and getting absolutely crushed!...what was I thinking? LOL).  The control & strategy of your player is truly in your hands which makes this app fun & very real.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is one of the best free games and you can keep advancing within it for many many hours.  You can even cheat by buying points with cash to upgrade or you can slowing earn your points (like me) by doing stunts and traveling further and further on the many courses.  I like all the different vehicles you can buy and then upgrade and I like figuring out the best vehicle for the many different terrains.  Minor hint: The the &#34;moon&#34; is the best for generating points.

B00DU74U74|4.0|Had some new angles on an old story. Well made in a modern si-fi way. If you are a fan than you need to watch this.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I think this book is extremely empowering for women. It gives you a different outlook on certain situations. Whether you work full time or stay at home with your kids I think this is a must read for women everywhere
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|I really don't understand what everyone is talking about. This album is not \\"different\\" or an \\"evolution\\" of Reznor's sound. If anything, it sounds derivative. I have never been bored by a NIN album until now. What's worse is that I realized the few shining moments of this album only stand out because they almost directly mimic better songs from his better albums. How many times can Trent write about things slipping away, things being put inside him, things he tells himself, etc. By now, we already know that he wishes he could stop himself, but nothing can stop him now. I just wish he'd stop writing such generic lyrics. I don't like being able to predict what words will rhyme in these songs.<br /><br />With the exception of \\"Everything,\\" I could take any song from this album, stick it on a b-side to With Teeth or The Slip, and be done with it. That's the only song that gives us a hint of something new: a bombastic power-pop anthem that's hopeful and sonically aggressive at once. Sadly, the excitement ends there. Had Reznor taken a bold new direction with this album, I would have supported it, even if it was a drastic departure from his past. The problem is that Hesitation Marks is too aware of its past. It's like how your mom is always self-deprecating about her age and you wish she'd just let it go and be happy with herself.<br /><br />Hesitation Marks is not too poppy. It's not a \\"new direction\\" I can't accept. It's just boring.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is truly fenomenal. Most apps are simple and tedious but Can You Escape is genious and a lot of fun! Once you start playing its extremely difficult to stop as well as continue because the clues are not all so obvious. I love the app and I'm waiting for a sequil!
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|good concept and well made film...just a little thin in storyline in places. I would watch it again. Enjoyed this
B001NFNFNA|5.0|This is a must see.  Angelina Jolie is amazing as a distraught mother.  Not so true-to-life, however, this is a great movie.
B009MO57H6|3.0|They focus too much on relating it to the game to the point where it takes a lot out of the movie trying to more or less put an 8hr story into 2hrs seems like rushed ran together good action somewhat but too the point where its very stupid at times exp under the gunfire of 200 plus only one person dies not even shot but by chainsaw wtf alice ram a licker at around 50mps yet no damage to the car at all very poor directing at that point all in all not bad just not what i expected by trying to hard and instead turning out corny and somewhat stupid
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love playing this game would recommend you download this game i can play this game allday long great and Awesome game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If I could give it now stars I would! Amazing cast, incredible storyline, and it just keeps you wanting more! All three seasons are well worth buying and watching over and over.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun game easy to use.I like the single touch to move the cards makes playing easy. Good graphics. Don't like the ads.
B0085TJUGI|5.0|What do you write when someone pulls back the curtain and reveals that there is no death, that all time is now, that we are all God singularly and plural  and that there is only love expressing itself?<br />This is written from the soul, firsthand, forever hand.<br />I'd give it all stars if I could. But how many stars do you give truth? And why even bother...just live to love and vice versa. This is the main star.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Great book!  Creepy as hell, but you can't put it down!!  Before vampires were sparkly, this book made the legend of vampires truly cool.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love the show, its hysterical. I can not recommend a better dvd set to order, other than another season. Happy happy happy

B00EY8BRGU|3.0|What starts out as an intriguing film slowly dissolves into a hard to believe mess.  I give it three stars for the cinematography and out of sympathy for the investors that lost a bundle.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|I liked the original Judge Dredd with Stalone, but this movie is a waste of time.. the main character is completely unbelievable, neither his voice nor his demeanor are enough to convince he's the judge, jury, and executioner.  Some action scenes are so setup and over the top I laughed at their ridiculousness.  This movie is so bad I couldn't even get through the whole thing and shut it off early.  Better effects than the original Judge Dredd but the execution and plot are far subpar.
B005R32L66|5.0|not a bad thing to have. I haven't used it yet but I also haven't been away for long enough to use it
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Rhythm & Blues<br />GREAT CD's!<br />Even people who don't necessarily listen to R & B would appreciate this collection of music.<br />Can't say enough about it.<br />It is not and misstake to purchase it for anyone's library.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! Leo does a great job playing Gatsby. I read the book in high school and it in no way shape or form caught my interest. This movie took me and caught my eye from the beginning. I couldn't have picked a better cast and the music was amazing. Will watch this movie until I die.

0064409422|5.0|I won't get into the controversy over which to read first...there is plenty of these reviews to read already, but personally I don't think it really matters that much. I did not read these as a child(somehow I missed that!), but stumbled across this same edition of \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" in a box of hand me down books that we received and decided to read it out loud to my 7 year old. The book said 1 and so I read it first, and we both were instantly hooked.  When we finished I came to find the iconic \\"The Lion The Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" so we could continue, and figured that this was a series that was worth owning. As is with any popular book, there was a huge variety of editions and sets to choose from, which can be overwhelming to sort through. Plus the reviews are all mixed up, so finding a review that focused on the edition and not content was also tough.  Since we already had \\"the Magician Nephew\\" in this full color collectors edition, I scrolled through all the paperback choices until I found the same, and I can say that it was worth the small effort to do so!  It is a really gorgeous paperback; thick, glossy, bright white pages with original artwork by Ms. Baynes that is vibrantly and tastefully colorized.  The cover art is also original, which really is nice as it matches the inside work and makes for a cohesive experience(that newer, fancy lion image on the cover of other books is really quite different looking than the inside images). After finishing this book, I borrowed a copy of \\"Prince Caspian\\" from my library so I could continue reading it to my son, and I can say that the traditional newsprint paperback pages are so inferior, and really makes reading this book less enjoyable, especially for reading out loud.  Seems silly, but truly the black font on the bright white background is so much nicer, and the color illustrations, while not necessary are a really nice touch, especially for children who still like to see pictures!  Needless to say, I haveordered \\"Prince Caspian\\"  in this edition,even though we are just about finished reading the library copy, and the next couple books as well, to add to our collection.  I plan on getting them all so as to have a complete set.  At a price point around $8.00 each, these make a nice gift, either as individual books, or for a really special someone, search out the whole set.  I have not seen any of the boxed sets of these particular books, and none that I looked over seemed to have this same cover art or quality. I think to get this edition as a set you will have to buy them one at a time and box them yourself.  Worth the effort in my opinion, but then again I am a sucker for quality objects.

Anyway...I don't doubt that there could be a fifth movie maybe focused on parenting or something awkward that would absolutely make a killing with these guys...maybe Jim and Michelle have a teen daughter that falls in love with Stifler's teen son or the other way around or maybe that their kids are homosexual and a daughter likes a daughter or son likes a son or something!

It will help many who have a medium or advanced expertise in computers and text formats. For others, like myself, a more personal help will still be needed, not only to perepare the electronic text, but also in other subjects.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very addictive game not too complex. I have a young daughter that enjoys the game just as much as I do. Graphics are ok but it's a fun way to pass time!!

B0084ANCBC|4.0|Didn't compare to a Dicken s. Story was great but was too lengthy in parts. The characterizations were remarkably clear and vividly came to life.

B00969PR18|5.0|this app is good for just about any thing to do with mapping the only disadvantage is if you don't have GPS on the device it on. But street names are downloaded with the map of the country or state you by but it is worth it if you don't have sell data. mapes are $1.99 which is less cost then a regular paper map.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is of the highest quality TV.  Can't wait to see more.  It is similar to the quality of the TV series Damages.
0061950726|4.0|I might not have read it except it was selected for our July Book Club, but it was a good read.  I read the entire book in 3 hrs traveling on the interstate in KS---where the Orphan Train museum is located by the way!  It kept me interested and a bit surprised.  I did find several mistakes with the names---what is the deal?  Most of us in book club did not &#34;buy&#34; her decision made after hearing about the fate of her husband (don't want to give any spoilers).  We agreed the author did it for plot development.  I sent the book on to my sister in law who only wants to read books with happy endings.  Next month we are reading THE CHAPERONE, which has the &#34;orphan train&#34; also-----just a coincidence.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I am now unable to play after weeks of my children and I enjoying this game. It is currently stuck on the loading screen. It flashes from loading to downloading but for two days now it has not progressed past 3%. I have read many other reviews but have seen no solutions so will have to delete this previously well-loved game. My children are extremely disappointed!
B000002HPT|5.0|The fourth full-length album from progressive metal masters Dream Theater might not be the band's finest hour, or even their best effort of the 1990's (`92's \\"Images And Words\\" takes the cake in that department). But it is still an inarguably great and immensely enjoyable and accomplished affair, nonetheless. As with any given D.T. recording, this one boils over with excellent instrumental prowess: Crafty, appropriately-heavy drum patterns, inventive, powerful bass lines, and, most importantly, simply astounding guitar work. In fact, \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" is almost worth buying just so you can once again bear witness to John Petrucci's godly skills. (His solos, in particular, are just plain phenomenal, no matter how heavily influenced by Steve Vai they might be this time around.)<br /><br />\\"New Millennium\\" begins sounding very much like a Tool song, with its spindly melodic leads, spiraling keyboard runs, and moaning bass lines. It levels off, though, when a pounding, doomy guitar riff, tricky bass groove, and Ozzy Osbourne-inspired singing enter the picture. But it is followed up by an even bigger standout track in \\"You Not Me,\\" which opens with an excellent drum intro before flowing into catchy, standout-worthy, wah-wah-drenched guitar leads. These great (and immediately memorable) leads are anchored by a strong, grumbling bass bottom, and are iced off by symphonic-sounding keyboard flourishes. The album then transitions through two power ballads -- well, actually, that's not quite fair to say, as the first of them, \\"Peruvian Skies,\\" begins sounding like a piece of bloated, meandering balladry with proggy acoustic strings and melodic, bubbling bass lines. But the song does gain some energy and momentum, though, by trafficking in a few heavy, sturdy, crunching guitar riffs, and heavy, chugging bass riffs around its mid-section. It also lets fly by ripping out a memorable guitar solo, too, one that is probably too screaming and shredding to be in a power ballad. But the latter of these two songs, \\"Hollow Years,\\" is a full-fledged ballad from beginning to end. It abides by a laid back and restrained tempo with melodically-plucked strings, but also slips in some in some gorgeous acoustic soloing. Needless to say, it all makes for a very pretty and spellbinding piece, and one that might be only six minutes in length, but is still an undeniable epic.<br /><br />Whew...that was just the first four songs! But anyways, let's move along and describe the fifth one, \\"Burning My Soul.\\" It begins with an ominous bass intro before eventually kicking into high(er)-gear with thrashy, groovy, Metallica-esque chugging and hefty bass lines. Some alleged double bass drumming is said to abound, here, too. But this number is mostly of note for having the said bass intro, and also featuring a really cool keyboard solo, to boot. Next comes \\"Hell's Kitchen,\\" a perfectly fitting album centerpiece, as it is an entirely instrumental piece that is epic yet simultaneously accessible, and sports a foreboding bass tone, and some memorable, shred-oriented, wah-pedal-molesting guitar leads that are positively air-guitar able. And it is followed up by another tune in \\"Lines In The Sand.\\" This one finds spectral-sounding guitar leads and keyboard melodies morphing into a heavy, driving groove anchored by muscular, rolling, bottom-heavy (and, at times, even mildly-funky-sounding) bass work. Indeed, four-string virtuoso John Myung really gets to strut his stuff, here, showing off his ever-so impressive skills by laying down one particularly deft, inventive, and fast bass line after another. But \\"Lines In The Sand\\" is also further highlighted by a batch of winding, soaring melodic/harmonic guitar leads, somber piano keys, and clearly Bruce Dickinson-inspired vocal wailing.<br /><br />Of the four tunes that remain, two of them are ballads. The first, \\"Take Away My Pain,\\" is a soaring piece that might boast some grumbling bass throbs, warm clean singing, and what-sounds-like tribal-beat percussion fills; but overall, it is a mostly forgettable inclusion in the album, and one that is immediately overshadowed by all of its surroundings. And the second of these two ballads, \\"Anna Lee,\\" sounds almost majestic as it makes its way through its piano-based arrangements.<br /><br />And the other two songs that round out the album are even better still. \\"Just Let Me Breathe\\" takes a little while to find its legs (as it begins with a not-overly-memorable, and unnecessarily long intro). But never fear, because around forty-three ticks in, the song takes off into a crunchy, up-tempo groove peppered with wah-heavy leads and a full-bodied bass grumble. It occasionally rips out some great, and technically-proficient guitar solos, too. And the latter cut, \\"Trial Of Tears,\\" is so great that it is arguably the album's highpoint. It is an even more progressive, sprawling, and expansive epic that is cut into three different sub-sections (\\"It's Raining,\\" \\"Deep In Heaven,\\" and \\"The Wasteland), clocking in at a combined total of a whopping thirteen minutes, and boasting some prominent, propulsive bass lines, and deft and thumping drum fills (including some surprisingly thundering double bass rolls). \\"Trial Of Tears\\"' main attraction, however, of course has to be the epic, jazzy, twiddly, ridiculously technical and multi-faceted guitar soloing that courses pretty much all throughout the tune's second half. Wildly epic, complex, decadently delicious -- heck, I could go on all day describing this soloing section, but instead I will simply say that Petrucci does some serious shredding, here, and his solo skills are truly astonishing and neo-classically-tinged. (But these solos, no matter how wailing they might be, are slightly more shred-oriented than the stuff put out by the likes of Yngwie Malmsteen and/or Cacophony.<br /><br />When looking at the big picture, \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" might not be Dream Theater's best or most original effort, but it certainly is one with enough innovation, experimentation, and spectacular musicianship to go around. As such, it captures this band (and especially their guitar-god, Petrucci) in all of their rich and progressive glory, thus making it further proof of the fact that D.T. are not only one of the absolute best progressive metal bands off all-time, they are easily the brightest prospects that the genre has seen formed since the days of Rush.-sounds-like tribal-beat percussion fills; but overall, it is a mostly forgettable inclusion in the album, and one that is immediately overshadowed by all of its surroundings.
